I want to welcome you all here to this com- mittee hearing. It's a hearing sponsored by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, of which I am privileged to be a member. I would first like to thank Senator John Heinz and Senator John Glenn, who are the chairman and ranking member of that Senate committee, for authorizing us to hold this hearing today. I think it's a continuation of the hearing I held last year in Albuquerque and also a continuation of hearings that the Special Committee on Aging has had in various other forums, particularly in Washing- ton. Let me also, at the beginning, thank the staff people who have worked so hard on this: Bill Benson-who will be joining us-is a staff person with the Committee on Aging. He's here today to help us and has done a lot of the legwork in getting this organized. We appreciate that. On my staff, Faith Roessel has taken the main responsibility on this: Becky Bustamante, Delores Garcia, Elizabeth Giagos, and Vince Murphy, all of them have worked at making this hearing happen today. I think Faith, in particular, has worked very hard in getting this to occur so I want to thank her. Let me mention one other sort of announcement and then I'd like to just briefly describe the subject of the hearing. For some of you who got here very early today, you may have noticed that we had a video recorder set up and television set with a program on there. The program that we were showing is one that was put out by one of the pharmaceutical companies, Hoffman-LaRoche, and it contains a quiz that you can go through called the \"How To Live (1)2 Longer Test.\" It talks about nutrition, about exercise, about gener-al lifestyle; and I think it's an interesting program.It's one that we had to show before most people got here becausewe didn't have time built into our hearing to show it, but I hopethat if any of you are interested in seeing it that you will stayright after the hearing. The hearing will end around 1 and thenwe'll show that again for anybody who's interested in staying towatch it. We also want you to know that the program is available throughour office or, of course, through that pharmaceutical company ifthere are particular senior centers or other groups throughout theState that would like to show it to their people. So let's go aheadwith the subject of this hearing. The hearing today focuses on the relationship between nutrition,aging, and health. We are now just beginning to understand thisextremely important connection. The treatment of illnesses associated with growing older hasbeen improving. We know with certainty that exercise and fitness,the safe use of medicine, smoking cessation, injury control, and pre-ventive health services lead to healthier lifestyles; but what we eatis perhaps the most significant factor in reducing the risk of dis-abling disease. We learned at the earlier hearing, last year, that seniors are justas interested in maintaining their health as anybody else and theyare never too old to pursue healthier habits. Good nutrition is di-rectly related to our health and choosing the wrong foods may com-plicate the future well-being of any of us.It is now known that overeating or eating nonnutritious foodscan lead to overweight and obesity, and obesity can lead to anarray of health problems: Diabetes, for one; high blood pressure,which of course can lead to heart disease and stroke.It is now known that the nutritional needs of the elderly may besomewhat different from the nutritional needs of the rest of thepopulation. A recent study of 10,000 people, aged 17 to 74, showedthat a drop in the intake of calcium, potassium, vitamin A, and vi-tamin C was strongly present in cases of hypertension, an all-to-common affliction of the elderly.It is generally recognized that an overabundance of salt in thediet can raise blood pressure. A diet low in saturated fats and highin vegetables and fiber, on the other hand, is recognized as ahealthy diet to control one's weight.A recent study involving seniors demonstrated that althoughthey know generally what foods to avoid, they did not know whatfood to eat instead. It's my hope that all of us can learn more aboutwhat the right choices are.Better nutrition is not up to individuals alone. It also depends onsocial and economic conditions, and on policymakers. We have anoutstanding selection of nutrition experts and Government repre-sentatives here today to discuss nutrition and malnutrition issuesamong the elderly, and to help shed light on these various aspectsof the subject. To lead off the discussion we have Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg of TuftsUniversity who is a nationally recognized expert in the field of3 human nutrition and aging research. He will give us an overview of the national perspective. Dr. Blumberg has studied the relationship between nutrition and aging, and is one of the most qualified individuals in the Nation to tell us what modern science now knows and what areas still need further study. I have also asked Dr. Blumberg to join me after his testimony to ask questions of our other witnesses as we try to reach definite conclusions and recommendations. Our first panel is going to be composed of five senior citizens who have very graciously accepted our invitation to be with us today. These individuals, like many of you, have had firsthand experience in what good nutrition can do to help older Americans. I know that they will tell us what's on the minds of older New Mexicans on this subject. The second panel will review the Government perspective; and here with us is the New Mexico director for the State Agency on Aging, Rita Maes; Sonia Crow of the Department of Agriculture; Dr. Evan Hadley of the National Institute on Aging; Wynona Town of the Indian Health Service; and I believe Valerie Conner is unable to be with us today from the Southwest New Mexico Area Agency on Aging, but her testimony is going to be included in the record.' Our last panel has the most difficult job. I have asked them to look to the future and suggest some directions that we can take to improve the delivery of nutrition services to seniors. Given these times of fiscal restraint, improved delivery and ac- countability must be encouraged. Dr. Bob Thompson, who is a pro- fessor at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, will ad- dress the clinicians' point of view; Kathryn Treat of the New Mexico Extension Service will examine the broader participation of extension agents in assisting seniors; and Stephanie Fallcreek, who is the director of the Institute for Gerontological Research and Education at New Mexico State University, will look at changes in the title III-C congregate meal program and at the dissemination of accurate nutrition education material. It has become increasingly clear to me that diet and nutrition are vital elements of a total health care delivery system. In 1985, the elderly will spend over 15 percent of their income on health care for an average of $1,660 per person. The elderly are also the heaviest users of all services. According to the Special Committee on Aging, they account for 29 percent of all hospital discharges and one-third of the country's personal health care expenditures, although they constitute only about 11 percent of our population. We, in the Congress, are looking toward prevention as a means of dealing with the rising costs of health care in the future; and I am personally committed to doing all I can to improve the health and productivity, and quality of life of New Mexicans and all Americans, particularly the elderly. I See appendix, p. 108.4 I am extremely pleased with the excellent panel of witnesses whohave agreed to be here today. Now I would ask if Dr. Blumbergwould go ahead and take the witness chair over here.Let me tell you a little bit more about Dr. Blumberg. Dr. Blum-berg received his bachelor of science degree in pharmacy and psy-chology in 1969 from Washington State University, and his Ph.D.in pharmacology in 1974 from Vanderbilt University School ofMedicine. He received postdoctoral training in cycle nucleatide metabolismat the Tennessee Neural Psychiatric Institute and the Universityof Calvary. Dr. Blumberg is associate professor of the School ofNutrition at Tufts University. His research efforts in this area arenationally and internationally recognized, and we greatly appreciatehis willingness to be here today and to put the whole subject of thishearing in some kind of national perspective for us.Please go ahead with your testimony, Doctor. STATEMENT OF JEFFREY BLUMBERG, Ph.D., ACTING ASSOCIATEDIRECTOR, HUMAN NUTRITION RESEARCH CENTER ON AGING,TUFTS UNIVERSITY, BOSTON, MA Dr. BLUMBERG. Thank you for your generous introduction.I'm delighted to be here to address issues about nutrition andaging, and I am particularly happy to share with you some of theviewpoints that I know are common among many of the nutritionscientists in this area now. Nutritional problems associated with aging through midadult lifeand the years beyond 65 have come to national attention for sever-al reasons. Nutritional status surveys of the elderly have shown alow to moderate prevalence of frank nutrient deficiencies and,more importantly, an increased risk of deficiencies in both institu-tionalized and in noninstitutionalized, free-living elderly.These conclusions in these surveys have been based upon assess-ments of dietary energy and nutrient intakes, measurements of bio-chemical values relevant to specific nutrients, and on the recogni-tion of clinical signs thought to be associated with nutrient defi-ciencies. In addition, nutritional status appears to influence therates of decline in a variety of organ systems, declines which arerecognized as important deleterious functional changes that are as-sociated with the aging process. So we are interested in finding out how nutrition may helpretard the rate of this kind of organ function decline.Nutrition can also be a factor in the progressive changes in bodycomposition that are associated with aging, such as the loss of leanbody mass or skeletal muscle, the loss of bone salts, and increasesin adipose [fat], tissue. Evidence also demonstrates that nutrition islinked to many of the chronic diseases which afflict older adultsand the elderly. There is now an increased interest in the role of diet and nutri-tion as a vital component of the health care delivery system for theelderly. We are reaching a point, now, where the need to assistthose requiring specific dietary management and to identify popu-lation groups which are vulnerable to nutrition deficiencies is be-coming very important, and even critical.5 While there is a recognition, as I mentioned, of the high-risk status of many elderly for nutrient deficiencies based on surveys, I would like to emphasize that nutrition surveys of the elderly have been of very limited scope. They have infrequently included indi- viduals over the age of 75, and they have often used varying stand- ards of comparison in presenting the frequencies of nutrient defi- ciencies. These kinds of limitations to the surveys make it difficult to come to as sound and conclusive evidence as we would like. Currently, survey estimates of energy and nutrient intakes are subject to many errors, for example, nonstandardized methods, errors in estimating food consumption, errors in our food table ana- lytical values from which nutrient values for specific foods are de- rived and errors in assumptions about the bioavailability of nutri- ents in the elderly-that is, do elderly really absorb and utilize nu- trients in exactly the same way as younger individuals do? Nutritional surveillance programs should, but very often do not, include measurements of nutrient levels in blood plasma and blood cells, and the use of nutrient supplements and medications has fre- quently been excluded from survey data, although these factors are known to significantly influence nutritional status. The only truly complete nationwide nutritional survey data available is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I-oftentimes referred to as NHANES-I-and that data is now over 11 years old. Although the study has been repeated in a NHANES-II study, that data is not yet really available from the U.S. Center for Health Statistics despite the fact that planning is already underway for a third survey, the NHANES-III, although I should add that for the first time, now, this group will be examin- ing elderly individuals over the age of 75. The current U.S.-recommended dietary allowance, or the RDA's, provides guidelines for assessing the intake of energy and specified nutrients for adults up to age 50, and then for a category labeled \"51 years and above.\" However, essentially all of the studies on nu- trient requirements have been carried out in young adults and then the estimated allowances for older adults and the elderly are based on extrapolation. That is, all of the RDA's that we currently have have really never been developed in the elderly. What the required nutrients are for the elderly are really just guesses based on what we know about young people to date. Studies that have actually taken elder- ly subjects and looked at them, and asked them what their require- ments are have really never been done. The current RDA for the elderly provides a downward adjust- ment in energy allowance with age, but protein and most micronu- trients are not so adjusted and are maintained at middle-aged adult levels. Though this situation has been imposed largely by a lack of ade- quate data, it does represent a lack of realism to assume that a 51- year-old and a 90-year-old have similar requirements. This period of the elderly is one of a dynamic change, a period in which nutri- ent and energy requirements between individuals and between identifiable population subgroups become greatly increased. Contrary to popular myth, the elderly don't become more and more alike: they actually become more and more different as they6 age. Among the factors contributing to this increased variability infood choices and in nutrient requirements in the elderly are socialcircumstances, including their isolation and differences in physicalactivity levels; differences in the severity and the rates of declineof body functions, particularly that of the gastrointestinal tractwhich has a significant role to play in how nutrition affects thebody; the presence of chronic digestive diseases is different amongthe elderly and that is going to affect their requirements for differ-ent nutrients, and last, both drug- and alcohol-induced nutrient de-ficiencies play a role in determining the different requirements ofthe elderly As I indicated, nutritional status surveys have revealed that sub-stantial numbers of the elderly are seriously lacking in particularnutrients. In some studies, over half of the respondents failed tomeet the recommended level of calories for energy and two-thirdshave less than adequate calcium intakes.Many older individuals eat few fruits and vegetables, particular-ly the vitamin A and the vitamin C-rich varieties; and despite thewidespread use of enriched breads and cereals, low intakes of the Bcomplex vitamins are common among the aged. Despite the preva-lence of nutrient supplementation among the elderly-and somestudies have shown that as many as haIf of the elderly may betaking nutritional supplements-the use of these supplementsoften appears irrational and inappropriate to their true needs.Decreasing energy intake, or the amount of calories you consumewith advancing age, has important implications for dietary qualityin terms of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Allowances for thesenutrients assume levels of overall energy intake considerably ex-ceeding a large portion of the levels actually observed.Dietary quality becomes very difficult to assure when overallenergy intake is low and requires a careful selection of proper foodchoices. Basically, what I'm saying is that the amount of energy orthe total number of calories the elderly consume is declining andyet the amounts of vitamins and minerals that are recommendedassume that the elderly are eating much larger amounts of foodthan they are. So in order to maintain an adequate intake of many of these mi-cronutrients, these vitamins and minerals, the elderly are going tohave to be much more careful in selecting what we call nutrient-dense food: eating less junk food or empty calories.Recent studies revealed that energy intake decreases even morerapidly in the very old due to the emergence of disability whichlimits physical activity. Surveys have frequently documented lowbiochemical indices for vitamins Bs, B12, C, D, folic acid, thiamin,riboflavin, and the minerals calcium, iron, and magnesium..However, it should be noted that, like the nutrient intake datawhich I told you is sort of \"soft\" data, the criterion for adequacy ofnutritional biochemical values are based upon ranges accepted foryounger adults. That is, just as we have extrapolated values of nu-trient requirements for the elderly based upon what, in fact, arevalues for younger adults, the same is true for biochemical norms.Yet we now know that the biochemical norms for the elderlymay be different from those of younger groups, and we have ev-dence along those lines demonstrated with standard hematologic7 tests, glucose tolerance tests, and plasma-albumin tests, all of which show that the standards, the biochemical indices for the el- derly, are, in fact, different than for younger people. Recent studies have indicated that requirements for some nutri- ents may be increased in the elderly. That is, despite the fact that we know, in many cases, their nutrient intake is low, just bringing them up to the current RDA levels, many believe, including myself, is still not adequate For example, vitamin D is essentially for maintaining normal calcium and phosphorus metabolism, and bone health. Unfortified foods are, in general, a poor source of vitamin D; but the evidence that we have generated within the past couple of years suggests that the elderly are less able to absorb vitamin D through the gas- trointestinal tract and they are less able to synthesize vitamin D in the skin following exposure to sunlight. Furthermore, the elderly seem less able to convert dietary pre- cursors into the active form of vitamin D in the kidney. Those die- tary precursors must be activated by enzymes in the kidney to the metabolically active form of vitamin D. So what I m suggesting is that for some nutrients, such as vita- min D, the RDA's don't take into account physiological changes that occur in the elderly that increase their requirements. Similar data has been generated for vitamin B6, which is an im- portant cofactor in many enzymatic reactions. Although vitamin BB is widely distributed in food, surveys have shown that as many as 50 to 90 percent of the elderly have low vitamin Be intakes. When we combine the low dietary intake with the age-related changes in vitamin Br, metabolism indicating that the elderly need higher levels, you can see where we are beginning to encounter some problems. Vitamin C is involved in oxidation reactions and appears neces- sary for normal collagen synthesis. Vitamin C is commonly found in foods like broccoli and kale, cabbage, and citrus fruits. Yet low vitamin C intakes and diminished blood levels are very common among the elderly. A recent study in elderly subjects noted that saturated blood levels of vitamin C were achieved only with average daily intakes substantially greater than that required in younger individuals. In order to maintain an optimal biochemical status to saturate the blood cells with vitamin C, elderly subjects had to take in much more than younger individuals. There's also a marked prevalence of low dietary intakes of calci- um among the elderly. Dairy products are consumed with decreas- ing frequency with age and vegetable sources do not contain calci- um which is readily available for digestion. Moreover, it has been found that calcium absorption may decrease by as much as 50 per- cent with age. We can talk about this later, but we certainly now know that there's extensive literature relating low-calcium intake to the loss of bone which accompanies aging. There are also diet links to acute stress or acute reactions. The ability of the elderly to respond to acute stresses, such as changes in altitude, heat, trauma, surgery, and infection, can be influenced by nutritional status. Stress or trauma can convert the marginal8 nutritional status of the elderly patient into an acute deficiencywith serious consequences. For example, acute infectious disease in the elderly can precipi-tate encephalopathy and confusional states in those with low thia-min status and neurologic abnormalities in those with low niacinstatus. So what I am saying is even though there may be no appar-ent ill effects to having a marginal nutritional status or subclinicaldeficiency, that any kind of acute stress can produce serious defi-ciencies in the elderly. Poor nutritional status has also been found to compromise a pa-tient's recovery and may result in secondary complications, poorwound-healing, impaired immunity, anemia, muscle and organ de-generation, prolonged hospitalization or even death.In addition to the effects of marginal nutritional status has onthese kinds of acute stresses and trauma that the elderly may un-dergo, we are learning more and more now about the linkage be-tween diet and chronic disease. It has been suggested that nutritionis the single most important component of preventative health care.Diet has been associated with cancer, heart disease, diabetes,stroke and hypertension, dental disease, arteriosclerosis, and cir-rhosis of the liver. Studies are now underway examining dietarytherapy with nutrient precursors of neurotransmitters, like cholineand tryptophan, to alleviate declining brain function. Preliminarywork now indicates a role for diet in retarding the onset of cata-racts. So with more research, we are learning that nutrition may beplaying a vital role in these chronic degenerative conditions thatare associated with aging, and that diet may be able to retard theonset or perhaps even prevent some of these conditions, thus en-hancing the quality of life of the elderly individual.While lifelong dietary habits have been linked to specific dis-eases, little, however, is actually known about the effectiveness ofspecific dietary management for the prevention of a number ofchronic diseases in the elderly. Nonetheless, as an example, identi-fication of major dietary risk factors, including cholesterol andsaturated fat, and our new understanding of the controlling factorsof plasma lipoprotein levels has brought closer the control of ath-erosclerotic vascular disease, the most common cause of morbidityand mortality among the elderly.The association between hypertension and obesity has long beenrecognized. More recently, high sodium and high protein, and lowcalcium and low potassium intakes have been correlated with hy-pertension. So we are learning more and more about dietary markers for dis-eases such as high blood pressure.Dietary guidelines have been proposed to reduce the incidenceand the severity of adult-onset diabetes, including the reducedintake of total and saturated fat calories and simple sugars, andthe increased consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber.There is now considerable evidence from epidemiological studiesand from research on experimental animals that a substantial pro-portion of human cancer may be attributable to the role of caloriesand obesity, to the role of specific nutrients-especially the dietary9 antioxidants like vitamins A, C, E, selenium and beta-carotene-or to non-nutrient dietary factors like fiber. Foods containing calcium, vitamin D, phosphate and fluoride have been found to play a key role in the genesis of osteoporosis although the effectiveness of dietary intervention after the disease is present is not established yet. Considering the long latency period of diseases like atherosclero- sis and cancer, it would appear that whatever dietary preventative steps are proven effective must be incorporated into lifelong eating habits. The role of diet in the etiology, the treatment and preven- tion of involutional organ system changes-such as declines in the capacity of the immune system or declines in kidney function-is a new research area not yet enough advanced to provide a basis for specific dietary recommendations, but nonetheless optimistic enough to indicate that diet, may play a partial role in reversing some of those conditions. No totally satisfactory treatment is currently available for the prevention or treatment of most of these age-related diseases; how- ever, we are now at a stage where new insights into cellular mech- anisms regulating these biological processes may lead to an in- creased understanding of why individuals develop these conditions and how nutrients affect them. Such basic research combined with prospective long-term clinical trials are the only realistic approaches available to begin to formu- late a rational recommendation and policy with regard to diet and health promotion. Nutritional requirements are influenced by numerous interact- ing factors, such as genetics, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, and medications. I don't mean to imply by any of my previous statements that nutrition is the only key factor. Certainly these other ones also play a role in the development of these age-related conditions. With regard to medications, it should be noted that the elderly are the greatest consumers of both prescription and over-the- counter drugs. While it has been largely overlooked by health care practitioners, the literature is now replete with examples of drug- induced nutrient deficiencies. It has even been suggested that drug-induced malnutrition in the elderly is commonly due to their excessive use of over-the-counter drugs, such as antacids, laxatives, and non-narcotic analgesics. Drugs may interfere with appetite and they may alter the absorp- tion and the distribution and the utilization of nutrients. Considering the common practice of chronic, multiple-drug treat- ment among the elderly and the prevalence of marginal nutrient intakes in this group, their high-risk status for drug-induced nutri- ent deficiencies is not surprising. Research has also revealed that the converse is true: that diet and nutritional status may affect both drug efficacy and safety. Adverse drug-nutrient interactions can often be avoided by ap- propriate diet, by nutrient supplements, or by a temporal separa- tion if health care providers are alerted to the problem and then intervene accordingly. I would like to make just a few comments about the nutritional care of elderly patients in contrast to some of these comments10 about healthier free-living elderly. The development of nutritionalprograms for the elderly is a perplexing task due to the lack of es-tablished dietary, anthropometric-or physical-measurements andbiochemical standards for the aged. Moreover, the use of clinical signs to diagnose malnutrition is adifficult task in the elderly as several of the body changes associat-ed with aging-such as flaking skin, sparse hair, or fissures of thetongue-mimic specific symptoms of nutrient deficiency. Theachievement of a desired food intake is also complicated in the el-derly because their physical, social, and emotional needs whichmay interfere with their appetite or limit their ability to prepareor consume nourishing meals. Several key points need to be kept in mind when considering thenutritional care of this heterogeneous group we call elderly pa-tients. Each elderly patient is, in fact, a person with highly individ-ualized abilities and capabilities, and widely varying levels of func-tioning. Therefore, a personal assessment is essential.Elderly patients are more likely than younger patients to be atnutritional risk and may be in a state of marginal nutrition defi-ciency upon entering into the health care system. A marginallynourished patient can become frankly deficient under the stress ofa new physical problem or an emotional upset.Elderly patients require a clinician's careful attention to nutri-tional status at the onset and then a well-worked-out care plan fol-lowed by a monitoring of progress. A personalized nutritional as-sessment should include a dietary history, a description of activitypatterns, and anthropometric and biochemical measurements.The simplest and often-neglected measurements are admissionbody weight and monitoring of nutritional status by weight deter-mination at regular intervals. A major change in a patient's weightshould always be investigated, the cause determined, and appropri-ate action taken. Clearly there is still much that needs to be learned about how toassess the nutritional status of the older individual and the elderlypopulation. While marginal nutrient intakes, increased risk of defi-ciencies, and low nutritional biochemical indices are commonamong the elderly, it is now necessary to clarify when these factorsare associated with functional changes. Dietary, anthropometric, and biochemical standards must be es-tablished and, ideally, correlated with a measure of function. Wedo not have those standards for the elderly now. Research programs have been established, particularly by theU.S. Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition ResearchCenter on Aging at Tufts University and by the National Institutesof Aging, which are examining three basic questions: How does nu-trition influence the progressive loss of tissue function with aging?What is the role of nutrition in the genesis of the chronic degenera-tive diseases associated with aging? And, finally, what are the nu-trient requirements of people who are already old, now?Thank you. Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much, Doctor.[The prepared statement of Dr. Blumberg follows:]11 PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFREY B. BLUMBERG, PH.D. Risks of Malnutrition in the Elderly.-Nutritional problems associated with aging throughout mid-adult life and the years beyond 65 have come to national attention for several reasons. Nutritional status surveys of the elderly have shown a low to moderate prevalence of frank nutrient deficiencies or of an increased risk of defi- ciencies in both institutionalized and non-institutionalized groups. These conclusions are based upon assessments of dietary energy and nutrient intakes, measurements of biochemical values relevant to specific nutrients and on recognition of clinical signs thought to be associated with nutrient deficiencies. Nutritional status appears to influence the rates of decline in a wide variety of organ systems, declines which are recognized as important, deleterious functional changes associated with the aging process. Nutrition also may be a factor in the progressive changes in body composition associated with aging such as the loss of lean body mass and bone and the increase in adipose tissue. Evidence demonstrates that nutrition is linked to many of the chronic diseases which afflict older adults and the elderly. There is now increased interest in the role of diet and nutrition as a vital component of the health care delivery system for the elderly. The need to assist those requiring specif- ic dietary management and to identify population groups which are vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies is becoming critical. Nutritional Surveys in the Elderly.-Despite the recognized risks of malnutrition in the elderly, nutrition surveys of this population have been of very limited scope, have infrequently included individuals over the age of 75 years, and have used vary- ing standards of comparison in presenting the frequencies of nutrient deficiencies. Currently, survey estimates of energy and nutrient intake are subject to many errors, e.g. nonstandardized methods, errors in estimate of consumption, errors in food table analytical values, and errors in assumptions about bioavailability of nu- trients. Nutritional surveillance should, but often does not, include measurements of nutrient levels in blood plasma and blood cells. The use of nutrient supplements and medications have frequently been excluded from surveys although these factors sig- nificantly affect nutritional status. The only complete nationwide nutritional survey data (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I) is over 11 years old and information gathered from NHANES 11 has hardly been analyzed by the U.S. Center for Health Statistics; planning for NHANES III is underway and includes a 75+ year old group. RDA 's for the Elderly.-The current U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance [RDA] provides guidelines for assessing the intake of energy and spe.cified nutrients for adults up to age 50 and for the category \"51 years and above\". However, essentially all of the studies on nutrient requirements have been carried out on young adults and the estimated allowances for older adults and the elderly are largely based on extrapolation. The current RDA provides for a downward adjustment in energy al- lowance with age but protein and most micronutrients are not so adjusted and are maintained at middle-aged adult levels. Though this situation has been imposed by inadequate data, it represents a lack of realism to assume that a 51 year old and 90 year old have similar requirements. This is a period of dynamic change, a period in which nutrient and energy requirements between individuals and between identifia- ble population subgroups become greatly increased. Among the factors contributing to this increased variability in food choices and in nutrient absorption, metabolism and utilization are: (a) social circumstances, includ-ng isolation and physical activity levels; (b) differences in severity and rates of decline of body functions, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract; (c) presence of chronic, degenerative diseases; and (d) drug- and alcohol-induced nutrient deficiencies. Nutritional surveys have revealed that substantial numbers of the elderly are se- riously lacking in particular nutrients. In some studies over half the respondents failed to meet the recommended level of calories and two thirds have less than ade- quate calcium intakes. Many older individuals eat few fruits and vegetables, par- ticularly vitamin A- and vitamin Crich varieties. Despite the widespread use of en- riched breads and cereals, low intakes of the B complex vitamins are common in the aged. Despite the prevalence of nutrient supplementation among the elderly, the use of such supplements often appears irrational and inappropriate. Decreasing energy intake with advancing age has important implications for die- tary quality in terms of protein, vitamins and minerals. Allowances for these nutri- ents assume levels actually observed. Dietary quality becomes very difficult to assure when overall energy intake is low and requires a careful selection of proper food choices. Recent studies reveal that energy intake decreases even more rapidly in the very old due to the emergence of disabilities which limit physical activity.12 Surveys have frequently documented low biochemical indices for vitamins B6, B12,C, D, folic acid, thiamin, riboflavin and the minerals calcium, iron and magnesium.However, it should be noted that, like nutrient intake data, the criteria for adequa-cy of nutritional biochemistry values are based upon ranges accepted for youngeradults; that biochemical norms for the elderly may be different from those of young-er groups has been demonstrated with standard hematologic, glucose tolerance andplasma albumin tests. Altered Micronutrient Requirements in the Elderly.-Recent studies have indicat-ed that requirements for some nutrients may be increased in the elderly. Vitamin Dis essenti for maintaining normal calcium and phosphorus metabolism and bonehealth. Unfortified food is, in general, a poor vitamin D source; deep sea fish have ahigh vitamin D content but meat, eggs and vegetables contain little of the vitamin.Limited evidence suggests that the elderly are less able to absorb dietary vitamin Dthrough the gastrointestinal tract and to synthesize vitamin D in the skin followingexposure to sunlight. Furthermore, the elderly seem less able to convert dietary pre-cursors to the active form of vitamin D in the kidney.Vitamin B6is an important cofactor in many enzymatic reactions. Vitamin B6iswidely distributed in food especially in meat, poultry, fish, rice, beans and nuts.Nonetheless, surveys have shown that 50-90 percent of elderly have low vitamin Bsintakes. There is now also evidence to suggest that changes in vitamin B6 metabo-lism with age result in a higher requirement of the vitamin to maintain optimumfunctional levels. Vitamin C is involved in oxidation reactions and appears necessary for normalcollagen synthesis. Vitamin C is commonly found in foods like broccoli, kale, cab-bage and citrus fruits. Low vitamin C intakes and diminished blood levels arecommon among the elderly. A recent study in elderly subjects noted that saturatedblood levels of vitamin C were achieved only with an average daily intake substan-tially greater than that required in younger people.There is a marked preva ence of low dietary intakes of calcium among the elderly.Dairy products are consumed with decreasing frequency with age and vegetablesources do not contain calcium which is readily available for digestion. Moreover, ithas been found that calcium absorption decreases as much as 50 percent with age.There is now an extensive literature relating low calcium intake to the loss of bonewhich accompanies aging. Diet Links to Acute Stress.-The ability of the elderly to respond to acute stressesssuch as altitude, heat, trauma, surgery and infection can be influenced by nutrition-al status. Stress or trauma can convert the marginal nutritional status of an elderlypatient into an acute deficiency with serious consequences. For example, acute in-fectious disease in the elderly can precipitate encephalopathy and confusional statesin those with low thiamin status and neurologic abnormalities in those with lowniacin status. Poor nutritional status has also been found to compromise a patient'srecovery and may result in secondary complications, poor wound healing, impairedimmunity, anemia, muscle and organ degeneration, prolonged hospitalization, oreven death. Diet Links to Chronic Disease.-It has been suggested that nutrition is the singlemost important component of preventative health care. Diet has been associatedwith cancer, heart disease, diabetes, stroke and hypertension, dental disease, arteri-osclerosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Studies are underway examining dietary ther-apy with nutrient precursors of neurotransmitters like choline and tryptophan toalleviate declining brain function. Preliminary work indicates a role for diet in re-tarding the onset of cataracts. While lifelong dietary habits have been linked to specific diseases, little is knownabout the actual effectiveness of specific dietary management for prevention of anumber of chronic diseases in the elderly. Nonetheless, identification of major die-tary risk factors including cholesterol and saturated fat and our new understandinof the controlling factors of plasma lipoprotein levels has brought closer the controlof atherosclerotic vascular disease, the most common cause of morbidity and mortal-ity. The association between hypertension and obesity has long been recognized;more recently, high sodium and protein and low calcium and potasium intakes havebeen correlated with hypertension. Dietary guidelines have been proposed to reducethe incidence and seventy of adult onset diabetes including reduced intake of totaland saturated fat calories and simple sugars and increased consumption of complexcarbohydrates and fiber. There is now considerable evidence from epidemiologicalstudies and from research on experimental animals that a substantial proportion ofhuman cancer may be attributable to the role of calories/obesity, to specific nutri-ents, especially the dietary antioxidants (vitamins A, C, E and selenium), or to non-nutrient dietary factors like fiber. Foods containing calcium, vitamin D, phosphate,13 and fluoride have been found to play a key role in the genesis of osteoporosis al- though the effectiveness of dietary intervention after the disease is present is not established. Considering the very long latency period of diseases like atherosclerosis and cancer, it would appear that whatever dietary preventative steps are proven effec- tive must be incorporated into lifelong eating habits. The role of diet in the etiology, treatment and prevention of involutional organ system changes such as declines in the capacity of the immune system and kidney function is a relatively new research area not yet enough advanced to provide a basis for specific dietary recommenda- tions. No totally satisfactory treatment is currently available for prevention or treatment of these age-related diseases. We are now at a stage where new insights into the cellular mechanisms regulating these biological processes may lead to in- creased understanding of why individuals develop these conditions and how nutri- ents affect them. Such basic research combined with prospective, long-term clinical trials are the only realistic approaches available to begin to formulate rational rec- ommendations and policy with regard to diet and health promotion. Drug-Nutrient Interactions.-Nutritional requirements may be influenced by nu- merous interacting factors such as genetics, alcohol, smoking, physical activity and medications. With regard to this last factor, it should be noted that the elderly arethe greatest consumers of both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. While large- ly overlooked, the literature is replete with examples of drug-induced nutrient defi- ciencies. It has been suggested that drug-induced malnutrition in the elderly is com- monly due to their excessive use of over-the-counter drugs such as antacids, laxa- tives and non-narcotic analgesics. Drugs may interfere with appetite and alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination of nutrients. Considering the common practice of chronic, multiple drug treatment among the elderly and the prevalence of marginal nutrient intakes in this group, their high risk status fordrug-induced nutrient deficiencies is not surprising. Research has also revealed that diet and nutritional status may affect drug efficacy and safety. Adverse drug-nutri- ent interactions can often be avoided by appropriate diet, nutrient supplements or temporal separation if health care providers are alerted to the problem and inter- vene accordingly Nutritional eare of the Elderly Patient.-The development of nutritional pro- grams for the elderly is a perplexing task due to the lack of established dietary, an- thropometric and biochemical standards for the aged. Moreover, the use of clinical signs to diagnose malnutrition is difficult in the elderly as several of the body changes which accompany aging, e.g. flaking skin, sparse hair and tongue fissures, mimic specific symptoms of nutrient deficiency. The achievement of a desired food intake is also complicated in the elderly because their physical, social and emotional needs may interfere with their appetite or limit their ability to prepare or consume nourishing meals. Several key points need to be kept in mind when considering the nutritional care of this heterogenous group called elderly patients. Each elderly patient is a person with highly individualized abilities and capabilities and widely varying levels of functioning; therefore, a personal assessment is essential. Elderly patients are more likely than younger patients to be at nutritional risk and may be in a state of mar- ginal nutritional deficiency upon entry into the health care system. A marginally nourished patient can become frankly deficient under the stress of a new physical problem or an emotional upset. Elderly patients require the clinicians careful atten- tion to nutritional status at the onset and a well worked out care plan followed by a monitoring of progress. A personalized nutritional assessment should include a dietary history, descrip- tion of activity patterns and anthropometric and biochemical measurements. The simplest, and often neglected, measurements are admission body weight and moni- toring of nutritional status by weight determination at regular intervals; a major change in a patient's weight should always be investigated, the cause determined and appropriate action taken. New Research Th-ograms.-There is much that needs to be learned about how to assess the nutritional status of the older individual and the elderly population. While marginal nutrient intake, increased risk of deficiency and low nutritional bio- chemistry indices are common among the elderly, it is now necessary to clarify when these factors are associated with functional changes. Dietary, anthropometric and biochemical standards must be established and, ideally, correlated with a meas- ure of function. Research programs have now been established, particularly by the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University and the Na- tional Institute of Aging to examine three basic questions: (1) How does nutrition influence the progressive loss of tissue function with aging9 (2) What is the role of14 nutrition in the genesis of the chronic, degenerative diseases associated with aging? (3) What are the nutrient requirements of people who are already old? Senator BINGAMAN. Let me ask a couple of questions and then we'll go on to our first panel. You talked about drug-induced nutri- ent deficiency among the elderly. Could you, in lay terms, describe for us the nature of this prob- lem as individual elderly citizens face it? Is this a cause of major health difficulties among the elderly? Dr. BLUMBERG. It is difficult to answer because we really don't have the data. I would feel confident in stating that while it may not be the cause of major physical problems, I would suspect that it is the cause of many more minor ones. Many of the side effects that you see from these kinds of drug- induced nutritional deficiencies result in symptoms like lethargy, malaise, anorexia [lack of appetite], weakness; unfortunately, I am afraid many clinicians may respond by saying, \"Well, what do you expect? You are growing old\"; when, in fact, if they should be alert to the fact that drugs may be inducing these kinds of reversible ef- fects through a nutritional mechanism. Many of these side effects like weakness and headaches may, in fact, have a nutritional basis and can be easily treated-or easily avoided if they're recognized. Senator BINGAMAN. Essentially what you're describing, as I un- derstand it, is that the taking of over-the-counter drugs is, in many cases among the elderly, interfering with a proper appetite and the proper intake of food, and that is causing these side effects that you just described. Is that what you are saying? Dr. BLUMBERG. Absolutely. I will give you a simple example. Many elderly use antacids, and not always for rational reasons. They are oftentimes inappropriately self-prescribed. Many antacids contain aluminum or magnesium hydroxide. That causes a chemical reaction with phosphate in the diet so it forms an insoluble aluminum-phosphate or magnesium-phosphate salt in the gut which, then, is excreted and the phosphate cannot be ab- sorbed. If a person is on a marginal phosphate diet, this can precipitate signs of muscle weakness and tingling in the skin and a loss of ap- petite; and if the clinician is not alert to that fact, he may miss the cause for it and misdiagnose the problem or, more unfortunately, pass it off to old age. Senator BINGAMAN. Let me ask on one other subject. You talked about the lack of adequate data from surveys on diets and what the elderly-and really what the entire population-is doing in the way of dietary habits. As you may know-I think you do know because one of my staff people has helped give you this information-we have a bill pend- ing in the Congress to try to put greater emphasis and a better structure on the monitoring of nutritional behavior in the country. In your view, is that a priority if we are going to come up with some reasonably intelligent solutions to some of these nutritional problems? Dr. BLUMBERG. I think it is a high priority. I think it is impor- tant to realize that nutritional status evaluations and assessments really serve two purposes.15 One is to gather data to evaluate the current status of the popu- lation just to see whether, in fact, it is true that the elderly are at risk for malnutrition and, if so, for which nutrients. It is difficult to do that when the data is as much as a decade old, to try to figure out what the case is now, particularly in light of changing dietary practices and a growth of the elderly population. But, equally important, it has to be recognized that these assess- ments also serve as research tools which we use to define what normal is, what baseline data are, and we use the data to develop hypotheses about the relationship between diet and health and dis- ease. We use this information to begin to correlate food intakes with blood levels and with functional performance. So these surveys are more than just finding out what elderly are eating. They really form the basis for new hypotheses and research programs designed to enhance the quality of life for elderly citi- zens. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Thank you very much. Doctor, please come over here and be seated and help me ask questions of our next panel. If our first panel could come up and take their chairs here. Our first panelists are: Gertrude Reynolds, Reynalda Lopez, Pres- ton Keevama, Susie Candelaria, and Simon Lopez. Why don't you people just take chairs there and let me introducepeople a little more. I am pleased to introduce this next panel, which is intended to give us an individual perspective on the relationship between nu- trition, aging and health. We have five members of the panel. Our first witness on the panel, at least in the order that I have them written down here-and we will just take them in thatorder-is Gertrude Reynolds who lives here in Albuquerque. She participates in senior programs through the Office of Senior Affairshere in Albuquerque. We appreciate you being here, and we are looking forward to hearing your testimony. Let me just say to all of you, whatever you may have written out in the way of testimony we will be glad to include in the record. If you would like to read that, that is fine. If you would like to just summarize, that is fine, too, whichever you prefer. STATEMENT OF GERTRUDE REYNOLDS, ALBUQUERQUE, NM, A PARTICIPANT OF SENIOR PROGRAMS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF AGING Ms. REmNous. First, what does nutrition mean? I looked up the word in the dictionary. Nutrition is the act of or process of nourish- ing or being nourished. Then I wanted to combine it with the wordnurture, which I also looked up in the dictionary: education, train- ing, that which nourishes. I want to combine these two words. Nourishing your body comes in many forms, such as food, love, people you have around you, ac- tivities, stimulations you give your body when you are nurturing it in a healthy way. That means exercise. That means your body is getting all of the elements that it needs. Proper nutrition cannot be gained by just eating the proper food. A16 very important aspect of reaching the maximum in good health is in making the decision, as an older person, to take responsibility for your own well-being. This would mean each of us seeking correct information and learning more about our body functions, particularly the digestive system. The key to proper nutrition means learning to observe our- selves; to listen to our bodies' signals that no one can tell about but you. The key is finding out what works best for you: what we need to avoid and what we need to change in the way of diet. There is no set formula for proper or correct eating. Each person has his or her own particular needs. It is a very individual thing. This is where learning to make observations about ourselves comes in. For example, eggs have many nutrients, but some people cannot tolerate them. We are like a machine: to run smoothly, we need the right foods. There are some signs of trouble most of us are familiar with that can be directly traced to our diet. Some that come to mind are gas, headaches, urinating too frequently, mucous in the throat which, maybe, a change of diet may correct: there is something, maybe, we could do about it ourselves. Older people, particularly, need to be aware of the attitude of resignation: giving up. \"Oh, my body is old. Nothing works proper- ly.\" Nothing we can do about it. In fact, we can pick this attitude up sometimes from professional people in the health field. Your body gets messages from your mind. The reality is: yes, an older body is not working as well as it did 50 years ago. We need to realize our bodies are always changing, as everything is constantly changing. Older people may say, \"I used to be able to eat this and I would be fine. I have eaten this all of my life.\" The best guide in eating foods is how does your body react to that food? Listen to your body now. Don't get fixed. Be on top of the changes basic for us. Whole, not processed foods, and our attitudes are both very important. At the turn of the century, the process of refining foods started. We are seeing the results of this now. It is very important to get the most whole food possible. This means whole grains, no preserv- atives added; the freshest vegetables and fruits that we can find and afford. Eating foods that are in season in our environment is a good way. How do we go about getting correct information and support in this nutritional nurturing process? We need to be seeking informa- tion from as many sources as possible in the health field, including the growing field of the healing arts. In seeking information and help, look at the person that you are seeking information from. Is she or he a healthy looking person? That's a good sign. Make the decision to take the responsibility for your own well- being. This is a sum up. This could mean getting more information about how the digestive system works. This could mean learning to observe your own body functions and reactions. This could mean keeping a positive attitude, not giving up on any part of your body. This could mean knowing the love you give yourself makes a difference in the way your body functions. This17 could mean continuing to look for correct information from morethan one source. I put down a few of the sources. I think magazines are full of articles of health now, I have gotten quite a bit of information:magazines that you get at home or in the library. Don't exclude working with nutritionists and others in the healing arts field; and find the most fresh and wholesome food that you can.

We appreciate that. Before we ask any questions of the panel, why don't we go through and have each of the panel members testify. Our next wit- ness is Reynalda Lopez. Ms. Lopez is also from Albuquerque. She is a former mealsite manager for the Congregate Meal Program, and is 731\u00bd2 years old. She participates in the senior program through the Office of Senior Affairs. We appreciate you being here very much. STATEMENT OF REYNALDA LOPEZ, ALBUQIJERQUE, NM, A PAR. TICIPANT OF PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF SENIOR AFFAIRS IN ALBUQUERQUE Ms. LOPEZ. Senator Bingaman, older members that are with us, my theme today is old age. Mr. Bingaman told you how old I am. I did not want it known. [Laughter.] Senator BINGAMAN. Well, it is right here in your testimony. Ms. LOPEZ. Neglect of the elderly person means you are depriv- ing that person, her or him, of food, heat, appropriate clothing, san- itary care, bathing, a clean place to live, medical and nursing care, and companionship. Now, I'm very much on companionship. I believe that these pro- grams that the nutritionist gives us takes care of lot of our-I know it does mine-necessity for companionship. Most of my chil- dren don't live around me anymore; a lot of my friends have gone, so I would stress companionship. Of all the meals I managed for 2 years in the nutrition program, I know that without that one meal a day many older people would go hungry. I am not talking about people that drive and self-cook. I am talking about people that no longer drive or cannot cook, maybe cannot even bathe themselves any longer. Without that one meal a day and the companionship that goes with it, they would go hungry. We old people like to talk-and I am one of the best talkers there ever was. Our sons and daughters are so busy trying to make a living they have no time to listen to us. Some people have no TV or telephone, or if they do they don't know how to use them. Some people never learned to read or write. This is the truth: I remember going to visit my father-in-law after his wife had passed away. I looked in the refrigerator and found it bare of food. The only thing that was in there were some sweet rolls. So I asked him, \"What are you eating?\" \"Coffee and rolls,\" he said. So I went to the store and brought back some canned soup and I thought, \"Well, all he has to do is heat it.\" I went back the next Sunday and the cans of soup were sittinF there unopened. I said, \"Mr. Meek, you haven't opened the soup. He said, \"I don't know how.\" There was a man that, when I became his daughter-in-law, was very proud, very active. I said, \"Who brings you the rolls?\" He said, \"The neighbors.\" I said, \"Why don't you ask the neighbors to open the soup for you?\" He said, \"I didn't want them to know that I couldn't open a can of soup.\"19 So his pride almost starved him to death. I took him home with me, that's the story of it, to take care of him. I'm very thankful for our Government, for all they do and try to do; but the redtape, oh, boy. [Laughter.] When old people are shoved from one agency to another, they get discouraged and they stop asking for help. Am I wrong, people? [Chorus of no s.] Ms. LOPEz. I'm right. So we want you to fix that. [Laughter.] Now, about food stamps. I have been refused because my check- ing account balance is too high. I still have a mortgage on my house. I pay $174 on it, then the gas, the lights and the water comes to $100, sometimes more. I pay $30 for supplement insurance for what the Government won't pay for me. I have to pay $30 a month on it. That, gentlemen, leaves me with $140 for food. To supplement my income, I sell at the flea market. I am just one of the millions of older people that are trying to supplement their income by doing something. Some of them crochet and sell their crochets; some of them even make chili and sell chili; and so on, so forth. But I am 73 years old, and how much longer can I supplement my income by selling at the flea market? I thank you very much. [Applause.] Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. Our third witness on this panel is Preston Keevama who lives in San Juan Pueblo outside Espanola. He has been very active in the Title VI Indian Grantee Program. He recently was elected Chairman of the Indian Council on Aging, a Council whose of membership is composed of all the Title VI grantees: Title VI, of course, of the Older American Act. Thank you very much for being here. We look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF PRESTON KEEVAMA, SAN JUAN PUEBLO, NM, CHAIRMAN, INDIAN COUNCIL ON AGING Mr. KEEVAMA. Senator Jeff Bingaman, distinguished guests, you young people out there, and those special people: the elders. My name is Preston Keevama. I am chairman of the New Mexico Indian Council on Aging which represents approximately 8,000 Indian elderly of the 19 pueblos of New Mexico and two Apache Tribes: Taos, Picuris, San Juan, Santa Clara, San Zuni, Laguna, Acoma, Jicarilla, and Mescalero. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to present this testimo- ny, which is supported by tribal governments throughout the State, and on behalf of the New Mexico Indian Council on Aging, which makes up a very unique and distinct population: those 55 and over. What makes us elderly Indians a unique population? Let me go back to the time when we were self-sufficient. We raised our own crops, weaved our own cloth, and made our own traditional attires, and built our own homes.20 Down through the centuries, our fathers and their fathers havelived on this land. It is a creation of the grassroots which promptsme to be here today. Because of our pride of being Indians, we have preserved ourself-identity. This we have done through the continued culturalfeast activities which requires preparation to strengthen our spirit-ual well being, and which is expressed through our dancing andother religious ceremonies. Because of the societal changes, lifestyles have changed for usalso. We are living in two worlds. Our Indian people willingly joined the Armed Forces to defendour country during World War II, which was a turning point, andupon our return to our reservations we brought with us new waysof living. Lifestyles began to change: industrial and technologicalchanges, which have had a significant impact on our nutrition,physical, and mental health. No longer were we grinding our own corn and raising our ownlivestock and crops. We were exposed to other conveniences; fastfoods overpowered our corn meal and posole; diets changed.Also, there was no longer a need to work out in the fields andcultivate our land. Substantial paying jobs were obtained in neigh-boring communities and urban settings. These lifestyles have cre-ated obesity and other physical and mental health problems.Today, we still experience our pride of being Indians. We contin-ue our festival ceremonies, eat our traditional food, but thechanges of lifestyle throughout the years have created concerns wewish to address today. Values and work ethnics are unique among us, the Indian popu-lation. However, because of other cultural exposures we find a needto strengthen these values and instill them in our young- andmiddle-aged adults in order to preserve our heritage.Statistics indicate life expectancy for Indians is low in compari-son to other ethnic groups; there are approximately 8,000 elderlyIndians in New Mexico facing numerous problems in the areas ofnutrition, physical, and mental health. Our senior citizen programs are providing our elders with onenutritional meal four or five times a week. This is not sufficient.We are in dire need of a more comprehensive array of services forour elderly to include not only one prepared meal per day, but tomotivate and instill in each and every elderly the desire to changehis or her nutritional intake and change the methods of food prepa-ration in order to insure a healthier and stronger individual.These services should include provision for social activities andpersonal growth, including physical fitness programs. We are indire need of additional physical facilities to include recreationaland other social activities as well as trained staff to work closerwith our elderly. Nutritional education is a vehicle to create attitude changes andeating habits, which in turn will reduce obesity, dependency on al-cohol and drugs. This will greatly decrease heart conditions,cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and other fatal diseases.Because many of us live on isolated reservations, transportationto health facilities and providers is extremely difficult and createshardships for the families. If more programs would be available to21 provide in-home care services, this definitely would eliminate the institutionalizing of our elderly. These services need to include the necessary nutrition, health care for the elderly, and other supportive services. By addressing the needs of the elderly in our Indian pueblos, we will be following the spirit of this hearing: \"The Relationship Between Nutrition, Aging, and Health.\" Thank you for this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Indian elderly in the State of New Mexico. Before I leave my seat, I would like to say Merry Christmas to all of you and a happy long life, and a prosperous New Year. Thank you. [Applause.] Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much for that testimony. Let's go on to the testimony from Mrs. Candelaria, who lives in Bernalillo. She has participated in the nutrition program since 1972 and she is going to be giving her testimony to us in Spanish. Becky Bustamante will be translating that for us. Thank you very much for being here. STATEMENT OF SUSIE CANDELARIA, BERNALTLLO, NM, A PARTICIPANT IN THE NUTRITION PROGRAM Ms. CANDELARIA [translated by Ms. Bustamante]. Ms. Candelaria has said that she is very happy with the meals that she is getting now through the nutrition program. She has been participating since 1972 and she has seen some changes in the nutrition pro- gram. Now the meals are healthier in that, before, some of the food they used to eat at the nutrition program was very heavy. When they went home, they didn't sleep very well. They just didn't have the energy that they have now. She is noticing, in the nutrition programs now, that there is an emphasis on fruits and better nutrition in the food. She feels that it is helping the senior citizens a lot because they have more energy; they feel better; they are happier; and they are sleeping a lot better than they had been before. So she is very thankful for the changes that have been made in the program these past few years. She also says that we are asked to remember that not only are these kinds of changes taking place at the nutrition programs, but that we have to take that emphasis and do it at home, too. So at home we should concentrate on getting good foods, healthier foods, lighter foods, and make sure that they are not cooked with the heavy fats. Our body will feel a lot better. She wanted to thank everybody for allowing her to be here and that is what she wanted to say. Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. [Applause] Ms. CANDELARLA. Ms. Bustamante did a very good job. Senator BINGAMAN. That's right. You did do a very good job. Ms. BusTAmANTE. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Candelaria follows:]22 participado el condado de que recivimos de los es tan trieste que a personaje que panpara sobrevivir. Yo ser parte de este programa. Senator BINGAMAN. Our final witness on this panel is Simon Lopez, who lives in Las Vegas, NM. He's a member of the advisory council for the Mora-San Miguel Senior Citizens, which is responsi- ble for delivering the nutrition services for seniors in Mora and San Miguel Counties. We are pleased to have you here today and we look forward to your statement. STATEMENT OF SIMON LOPEZ, LAS VEGAS, NM, MEMBER OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL, MORA-SAN MIGUEL SENIOR CITIZENS, INC. Mr. LOPEZ. Senator Bingaman, members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, it is indeed a pleasure to be here this morn- ing before you. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to testify on behalf of my fellow senior citizens. As a member of the advisory council for our senior citizen pro- gram in the counties of Mora and San Miguel, I have had the op- portunity to see the results of good nutrition over a period of 5 or 6 years. I myself, retired about that many years ago. Being a widower, I can assure you that being able to attend a senior citizens' center where they provide us with nutritious meals for 5 days per week has certainly benefited myself tremendously. However, let me tell you of what I have observed in our own pro- gram. The Mora-San Miguel Senior Citizens, Incorporated provides many related services to our senior citizens. Among those are con- gregate meals at our five centers located in the communities of Las Vegas, Mora, Pecos, Wagon Mound, and Villanueva. At these same communities, we also provide home-delivered meals to senior citi- zens who are bedridden or otherwise unable to leave their homes to attend the centers. Gentlemen, if you have ever had the opportunity to visit a senior center, especially ours in Las Vegas, you would see that on any given day the center is crowded to over capacity, all senior citizens. Our entire program provides over 350 congregate meals and ap- proximately 40 home-delivered meals daily, 5 days per week. This,23 alone, should tell you that there is a need for good nutrition for theaging. I believe that the clue here is that as we grow older and our fam- ilies leave us we are many times left alone and I don't have to tellyou how it feels to eat alone; and how about shopping for oneperson? Have you ever seen a senior citizens shopping cart? I believe that this might be a typical shopping list for somesenior citizens: two TV dinners, one 6-pack of Coke, one box ofchocolates, one box of donuts, and one small jar of instant coffee. Now, tell me, is this a way for a senior citizen to receive a nutri-tious meal? Even if you were to buy good and nutritious food, there is alwaysthe problem of cooking; but let me tell you, our program meals areplanned by professional staff. The Area Agency of Aging and thetate Agency of Aging monitor these programs very closely.Each meal served at our center provides at least one-third of thedaily nutrition required for an adult. I feel that most of the time itprovides much more. Especially for those of low and fixed incomes,it might be the only food they received for that particular dav. I believe that good nutrition is very much related to good health. I also believe that if good nutrition is provided health-related prob-lems will be fewer. Now, some of the important activities and services provided inour center in Las Vegas are as follows: The most essential service andactivity, as I have already mentioned, is the service of noondaymeals. These meals are served daily Monday through Friday fromabout 11:45 to 12:30 p.m. People start coming to our center about 9:30 a.m. or before. Why so early? Well, we come early because we want to associate withour primos and primas, compadres and comadres. You notice I useSpanish to express good will and friendship, and being intimate.It is then that we joke, we talk, we exchange ideas. We tellchistes, adevinanzas, and cuentos. These words, in English, meanjokes, quotations, and riddles. Some seniors know many of theseand others don't, but we all listen and have a good time.[Laughter.] It is a lot of fun and all of this really means a lot to all of usthere. Now, after lunch, some seniors play bingo on Mondays andWednesdays, and a game known as pokeno is also played on Mon-days, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Other services and activities provided by our program are, well,shopping assistance for the elderly; escort service for the elderly;information and referral; nutrition education; transportation; income tax assistance; blood pressure checkups; and legal assist-ance and other things. Occasionally, we invite local attorneys to talk to us and they talkto us on such subjects as wills, property, transfers of property, andother legal matters. They also answer questions asked by the audi-ence. General legal advice is good information, I believe, to the elderly. Now, something big for us was the campaign and election for abond issue to build a new senior citizens center. This was an excit-ing thing. It took place in July 1984.24 We formed a big coalition composed of the different senior citi- zens' groups to campaign for the bond issue. Other groups who joined us were the National Retired Teachers Association, the American Association of Retired Persons-I am a member of that organization also-the Public Employees' Retirement Association, the Citizens in Maximum Activities-CIMA, Foster Grandparents and women's clubs. We won big, by about a 4 to 1 ratio, in favor of the bond issue. It was a $275,000 bond issue. Thanks to God, the new center is now being built and hopefully will be available for use by April of this next year. We will be very proud of this beautiful 8,000-square-foot building, which will be en- joyed not only by the seniors of today but also by the seniors of to- morrow. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we also have our problems and diffi- culties and reverses in our centers. Let me give you an example. This thing does not give much mental nutrition or health to my buddies who handle the business of this program. At the present time, there is a civil action case pending in the Fourth Judicial District of New Mexico. The defendant is a Mora- San Miguel senior citizens' organization. The plaintiff is a gentle- man who is suing us for breach of an employment contract. The gentleman, who was discharged, was a driver of one or our center vans. He is claiming, among other things, punitive damages in the amount of $15,000. I understand that this gentleman re- ceived complete unemployment compensation benefits, but he is suing for additional damages nevertheless. It is not proper, I believe, to discuss the merits of the case now. It is up to the court to decide who is right and who is wrong. It is not our intention to interfere with the administration of the court. However, it is not improper for the public to know and be in- formed of the issues and what is happening. In this case, where many poor senior citizens are actually defendants why is it in that this great Government of ours, with so many public agencies to defend the poor and the elderly, there appears to be no defense relief available to the senior citizens of Mora and San Miguel Counties? The plaintiff is represented by a public agency known as the Northern New Mexico Legal Services, Inc. It seems that this public legal agency, which is supported by public funds, could be provid- ing legal advice and defense to the many senior citizens of theMora-an Miguel organization rather than taking us to court to obtain damages from us. What are their priorities? It is not a matter of the senior citizens being liable or guilty, ornot being liable or guilty. It is not a matter of us being the plain- tiffs or the defendants. It is just simply a question of who is supposed to represent our many elderly and poor in a civil action of this nature? Our organi- zation has, however, engaged the services of a private attorney to represent us in the above case. In closing, I want again to remind you that good nutritious meals are the best insurance that people will remain healthy throughout their lives; and I ask that you support senior citizens centers throughout the Nation.25 Thank you very much. [Applause.] Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. Let me just ask a couple of questions and then, perhaps, Dr. Blumberg has a question or two he would like to put to this panel. Mr. Keevama, let me ask you: We had a hearing in June in Gallup. This hearing was done under the auspices of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs. One of the issues that came out very strongly, was the problem of the greatly increasing inci- dences of diabetes among Indian people in this country. Out in the Gallup area, of course, was mostly where we were talking about; but I wonder if that is something that you have en- countered or are aware of in your position looking into the prob- lems of Indian elderly. Mr. KEEVAMA. Yes, I am aware of that. You know, in different sections of reservations and communities, you take the Gallup area, their diet, as far as I know throughout the vast reservation of the Navajos, is much different than the Pueblos' diet. So maybe in there there is something that creates this situation; but, you know, not being very knowledgeable about how all sick- nesses are created, I just don't know what the cause of it is. Maybe perhaps we could do some research into some of the diets. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Mr. KEEVAMA. I know that in Navajo country your mutton stew, I believe, is a main diet and it is delicious. Then among our people, of course, we have the chili, the papias and all of that. Somewhere in there, something is wrong. Senator BINGAMAN. All right. Let me ask, if I could, Ms. Lopez and also Mr. Lopez-no rela- tion-either one of you, if you would have any thoughts on the question of home-delivered meals out of the senior centers. I have been concerned that people who are not able to get out and go to senior centers are really not able to do a whole lot for themselves, and are dependent upon these home-delivered meals. Yet most of the programs that we have in the State try to deliver those meals 5 days a week or even fewer. Is that a problem that we should be worried about? I mean, should there be some provision for home-delivered meals on a weekend for people who are shut-in? Is that something that makes sense, in your opinion, Ms. Lopez? Ms. LOPEZ. I would think so, Senator Bingaman. My concern, of course, is mainly for myself because I am getting older; and I would very much appreciate, when I am no longer able to get to the nutrition center, to have a meal delivered to me. I understand there is a meals-on-wheels' or something. They charge you quite a bit. People on a low income cannot hardly afford it. But where I was the manager, we delivered at least 10 meals a day; but one of our members would do it. We did not have the fa- cilities to deliver the meal. Yes, I believe it is very important; and, like, you say, on the weekend.26 We always make a joke at the center: Well, we will go hungry onthe weekend, you know. It is not really true, but it might be true of people that cannot cook; that are blind or I don't know what. I don't know how to say it, but a lot of people cannot do things, maybe because they are so sick or depressed. Depression is a very bad thing and it comes through to you by nutrition; I know that, If you are in a depression, it is hard for you to get up and cook ameal or even go somewhere, or even get out of that nightgown and wrapper that you are in all day long. I had a little experience with that when I lost my husband. So, yes, I believe that meals delivered would be very, very good; very beneficial to our people. Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Lopez. Mr. LOPEZ. She said it all, I think. I agree with her. Some ofthose people, it is a good thing for them to get the meals at home, you know. I mean, it means much to them. You don't realize how much it means to them, but it really means much to the poor. They need someone to go and see themand take them one meal. I think it's a good thing. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Mr. LOPEZ. I really believe it is something needed. Ms. LOPEZ. My daughter-in-law delivered meals for a while forthe meals-on-wheels and she would say, \"They don't let you go. Thepeople want to talk to you so much,\" you know. It would make herlate to deliver the other meals because the person just clung to herto talk to her. That's why I mentioned the companionship that the nutrition program gives to us. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Yes, sir? Mr. KEEVAMA. May I add something to the delivery and themeals at the site? We have not really looked into the situation where the peoplethat have diabetes. They eat the same kind of food that is prepared for us. I believe we need to do something about that. We may have to fix special food for their special diet; but every- body that goes there eats the same type of food. This is what weare looking at. Senator BINGAMAN. Let me just ask one final question of any- body who may want to comment on it. To what extent do any of these nutrition programs that you arefamiliar with try to actually educate people on how to eat better? I mean, is that part of what goes on at the senior center in Las Vegas or Albuquerque, or wherever? Is this something that is part and parcel of the program, or isthat part always ignored? Ms. LopEz. No. We have had people, like Dr. Blumberg, talk tous about how we could eat and exercise, and everything. We havepeople real concerned on that. I know that when I was manager at the mealsite, I also toldthem what they should do on the weekend when we were not serv-ing them meals. Also, I used to stress cleanliness with people.27 We do invite doctors and nurses to come over and speak to us. I don't know if the other programs do, but ours does. Senator BINGAMAN. Anybody else have a comment on that? [No response.] Senator BINGAMAN. Doctor, go ahead. Do you have some ques- tions? Dr. BLUMBERG. I would just like to say that I think that all the comments were excellent and really underscore what some of the best nutrition experts in the country are really, now, documenting. It is evident that you already know. Certainly, Ms. Reynolds' comments that nutrition is more than just food, that it is really a social experience and the companion- ship is an important element to it. I would also add, certainly, physical exercise as part of some of the other congregate feeding programs is probably almost as important as the meals themselves. I would address one question to Ms. Reynolds. You mentioned that you get a lot of your information and advice from magazines. Are there others-nutrition specialists, registered dieticians or pharmacists or physicians-that are readily available to provide you with nutrition advice that is more specific to your needs than a magazine article could address? Ms. REYNOLDS. Well, I, personally, have gotten a lot of informa- tion from a nutritionist. I think that that's probably my biggest source, but I also read Prevention magazine and other magazines. If I don't get them, I can find them in the library. Dr. BLUMBERG. What sources do you have other than magazines? Ms. REYNoLDs. A nutritionist. Dr. BLUMBERG. Ms. Lopez, you mentioned the congregate meal program. Several of you have. I was wondering, who was involved in helping design those pro- grams and what the diets should be? Do you know who gave you the input on that? Ms. LopEz. No, I don't; but I believe the cooks are-when I was the manager, they also sent us a questionnaire on people who were eating their meals, that they wouldn't be thrown away. If some- thing was, then they would stop serving it. But they do have meetings on nutrition, you know, because when I was on staff we were obligated to answer questions and help people out with their problems. Dr. BLUMBERG. At the time, you feel that there was an evalua- tion afterwards that meals were being eaten and the people felt that they were helpful? Ms. LOPEz. Yes. Dr. BLUMBERG. From some of the comments I heard Mr. Kee- vama make, I am not sure why when meals are being provided; if there could not be someway that the nutrition education that you ask for could not somehow be provided along with just delivering the meals. It is just the driver who presents the meal and then goes away, or is there a nutritionist involved in that? Mr. KEEVAMA. We do have the drivers that deliver meals. How- ever, we are into that now because I think it is necessary that we have some knowledge, especially the cooks, of what is good and28 what is bad; but we do have workshops and our cooks are pretty knowledgeable about how our diets should be, the balanced diets. So we get good meals. Dr. BLUMBERG. Good. I particularly appreciated Ms. Candelaria's comments about how she's learned from the meals that she's received and been able to take those home and translate them into her own diet changes showing that people can, in fact, change their diets to those which are more healthful. I actually don't have any more questions, but I will use the brief opportunity of sitting up here to relate one story of the study that was done in Boston among several hundred people, who were chosen because of low blood hemoglobin levels, with low iron levels. The study question was: Would iron supplementation improve their status? They had a control group that received no supplement and a group that received an iron supplement, and they all got to- gether once a day, 5 days a week for a noontime meal. When the study was over and they evaluated the participant's status, they found that everybody's nutrition improved, everybody's blood values improved and it wasn't the nutrition supplement, but the mere provision of one healthful meal a day in a setting where there was companionship and socialization: that that was more im- portant than the iron pill. Ms. LOPEZ. That is what I stressed. That milk that they give us each day is very, very important. I know there are a lot of elderly people give theirs away or don't drink it, but I drink more milk now than I ever did before. I used to live on coffee, practically; but that milk that they fur- nish us every day is very important to our health. Senator BiNGAMAN. All right. We thank everybody on the panel for their excellent testimony. Ithink I will have a 5-minute recess here while the next panel comes forward. The next panel is going to talk about the Government perspec- tive on these problems. Thank you very much. [A brief recess was taken.] Senator BINGAMAN. We will hear from our second panel. This panel is to discuss the Government perspective on all of this. First of all, several of the people in the audience have said they have had a little difficulty hearing the first panel so if you folks would speak right into the microphones, that might help some. Let me introduce our panel. Our first witness is Rita Maes, the director of the State Agency on Aging. She is going to testify onthe Government perspective on this relationship between nutrition, aging and health. She has been working with senior citizen pro- grams for many years; and prior to being appointed director of the State Agency on Aging she served as the director of the Senior Citi- zen Program for the city and county of Santa Fe. She has worked with senior programs at the grassroots level. Inher new position, she knows the problems of older New Mexicans. We thank her very much for being here. So go right ahead.29 STATEMENT OF RITA MAES, SANTA FE, NM, DIRECTOR, NEW MEXICO STATE AGENCY ON AGING Ms. MAEs. Thank you. Good morning, Senator. Senator BINGAMAN. Good morning. MS. MAEs. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the panel, I am going to forgo most of the testimony in reference to the history of senior centers and how they develop nutritionally. I want to commend the panel that was up here before us, the consumer panel. They spoke very well and depicted the picture of what was going on in the senior centers and how the emphasis and the shift has been directed into more help. I would like to give you a little bit of a review of what our budget looks like and then probably go into some unmet needs and the continual needs of the elderly, and then some recommendations on the behalf of the State Agency on Aging. My office, of course, received Federal dollars. We are authorized to implement Older American Act dollars in conjunction with State dollars. From the Federal Older Americans Act, we use $1,175,902 for congregate meals and $323,144 for home-delivered meals. These funds are supplemented by the New Mexico State legislature in an amount of $1,052,809. With these funds, it is estimated that 24,000 persons received a total of 1,283,520 congregate meals in the period October 1, 1984 through September 30, 1985. In the same period, approximately 6,000 homebound individuals received 459,572 home-delivered meals. These dollars represent 16 percent of our total budget and our budget is broken down into transportation, recreation, INR, advoca- cy, investment programs, and several other-senior companions, Foster Grandparents. But 16 percent goes toward nutrition. We fund 29 programs in the State to provide these meals. These figures represent only those meals provided with funding from the State Agency on Aging. The title VI Indian Senior Citizen Programs also serve meals in the various pueblos and reservations. Many community organiza- tions provide meals-on-wheels or similar nutrition services without any Federal or State support. I think what I would like to say, addressed to your remarks earli- er, Senator, and some of the remarks that Dr. Blumberg made ear- lier: We have some programs that are still within the public school system, and these meals are designed for children. The RDA is dif- ferent, as mentioned earlier. However, while this is primarily in the Colfax area where I was visiting last month, we only are able to provide meals 3 days a week in the Colfax area within the school system. But oftentimes, even though the RDA for the child and the menu is a lot differ- ent-and it may be just hamburgers and hotdogs-that is probably a better meal than a senior citizen going to the store and paying 75 or 80 cents for a can of spam, which is probably a primary diet within the low-income elderly, primarily the Hispanic elderly. I am speaking through the experience of being the local provider when I would go into the home. Many times, their diet is just potted meat and crackers during the lunch period if they're not uti- 62-178 0 -86 -230 lizing the congregate meal system. It is a very, very critical situa-tion. In terms of the unmet needs, any discussion of nutritional serv-ices provided by the State must include our awareness of the in-creasing need among older persons. Having a meal that meetsone's minimum daily requirement for these special nutrients isoften the determining factor in whether a senior remains healthyand active, or moves into a period of deteriorating health and de-pendence. Nutrition is a basic component in the management of the majorchronic diseases, cardiovascular, diabetes and, now, cancer. Withthis in mind, it is increasingly important to address nutrition seri-ously as we develop our plans for the future delivery of primaryand long-term care. Everyone recognizes that we must now focuson prevention and risk reduction in health care if we are to makemaximal use of our public health care dollars.The prevention of one's institutionalization saves significant dol-lars that can be used to help many people remain in their homesand their communities. It is difficult to estimate, in hard numbers,of the number of people that would access congregate milk pro-grams if there were room for everyone.The area agencies on aging do receive requests continually forthe expansion of the nutrition sites. For example, the SouthwestAAA is currently holding two requests to open new sites, and thisis also true in the eastern plains of New Mexico.We made construction dollars available, however, we have notbeen equally successful in making the operating dollars availableso that we can provide the active service-transportation of nutri-tion-when we are looking at expansion areas.This is especially frustrating for them because, as one AAA di-rector said recently, I know it's not just nutrition the seniors onthese sites will not get. It is access to the entire continuum of care.Let me address this continuum of care to get some sense of howthe need for nutrition services is increasing and will continue to doso in the future. One measure is to look at those needing assist-ance. Persons who need help with their activities of daily living usual-ly need nutritional services. The inability to prepare a daily mealcan mean the difference between living at home or having to beinstitutionalized. The home-care supplement to the National Health InterviewSurvey, conducted during 1979 and 1980, obtained information onthe need for assistance in essential personal care and home man-agement activities. The proportion of elderly persons needing helpin this area increases dramatically in the upper age ranges.While only 6.7 percent of persons in the 65 to 74 age rangeneeded the help of another person, this figure doubles, to 15.7 per-cent, in the 85 and over age group. By the same token, 34.8 percentof the persons 85 plus need help in one or more basic activities and26 percent need help going outside the home.Clearly these are the most frail of our aging population. Howev-er, they are also those most in need of services such as nutrition sothat they do not become dependent on Medicaid dollars for exten-31 sive premature institutionalization-and that's often the case, and it is a very, very frightening statistic. This 75 plus group is also the fastest growing segment of the pop- ulation. By the middle of the next century, the relative number of those 75 plus to the total population is projected to be 1 out of 8 and will be greater than the current proportion of 65 plus individ- uals to the general population, which is now 1 out of 9. These trends have far-reaching policy implications because it is these older individuals who have the greatest need for social, income, housing, and health services. It is through congregate mealsite or home-delivered meals that they could gain entry to in- formation and referral, and other systems. Addressing the needs of the old-old does not fully represent the need which nutrition programs address. Another way to reflect the need in New Mexico is to acknowledge the fact that elderly persons in New Mexico live on very low incomes. The American Association for Retired Persons reported that the median household income of the elderly is only half of the nonel- derly. Elderly women living alone experience a 33-percent poverty rate with 85 to 95 percent of them dependent solely on Social Secu- rity and FSI. For minority elderly, projections indicate an over 40- percent poverty rate. The truth is that good food costs money and when decisions as to whether to be warm or hungry have to be made, the quality of one's nutrition may go down. The provision of one balanced nutri- tious meal per day can make a major difference in a low-income person's quality of life, not to mention the socialization and access to health services available through nutrition programs. In terms of implementation of the recommendations, I would just like to say that we would need your assistance, Senator, in the repeal of the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce the per-meal level. This is House bill 2453, which has passed the House and is now being reviewed in your committee. I think it might have moved out of that committee. What that does, that provides the senior programs with a cash- in-lieu reimbursement rate. We were threatened recently to have that reduced. That would have very strong implications on our pro- grams because that would have to reduce the amount of milk that we can serve. Although I talked about the budget being 16 percent of our total budget going to nutrition, that is not enough. That is definitely not meeting the needs of the elderly population in need of nutritional services. I think I mentioned 24,000 elderly in New Mexico are coming to our congregate sites and 6,000 are receiving home-delivered meals. We have, in New Mexico, approximately 200,000 senior citizens. So you can see that the dollars-although I feel they are being used in a very cost-effective manner, we are not able to reach the entire segment of the population in terms of the elderly poor because the dollars just are not sufficient for this operation. Second, I would also like to recommend more flexibility be given to the State offices and area agencies in the use of their service dol- lars. The AAA's cannot readily use these funds to hire nutrition-32 ists, yet they are primarily responsible for ensuring the quality ofnutrition services at the local levels. Two AAA's, as mentioned earlier, felt the need to be so greatthat they used one-time funds to hire nutritionists. This is difficultbecause this is a one-time expenditure. It is difficult to go out andhire a person knowing that that person is going to be on it for 1year. But what I have seen thus far by the use of these nutritionists inour area agencies on aging, they have made an impact in assistingand developing good, sound menus, cost-effective menus to the el-derly and to the local providers. When we went into reorganization, we did lose our nutritionistat the State level. We are still trying to secure some dollars tosecure that position at the State level so that we can plan mealsmore effectively for the area agencies and the local providers.A lot of the local providers, and one of our area agencies onaging, are utilizing the existing resources in the communities suchas hospitals, home-health extension offices, home economics, thecolleges-utilizing those resources to help us develop menus inNew Mexico. Third, we need to recognize the hard-working commitment ofother community programs in providing nutrition for the elderly.Local groups, such as the Storehouse in Albuquerque and theWorkers That Care of the Alliance of Churches, provide food in sit-uations of extreme stress or emergencies and are to be commendedfor what they can accomplish with very limited resources.Again, this is often a one-time, last-minute, acute rescue. It doesnot provide for the ongoing, day-by-day needs that many peoplehave. Recognition and appreciation should also be extended to thecounty extension agents who voluntarily provide nutrition consul-tation and education to many mealsites. This reflects the personaldedication of individual extension agents.Finally, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important wefeel the provision of nutrition is within the aging services' continu-um. The United States has a reputation of being a Nation that doesnot prevent fires until it smells smoke. Clearly, we know we face an aging population in the future, andthat now is the time to build a system to meet the needs. We arealso aware that acute primary care uses up the majority of ourhealth care dollars and serves relatively few people.If we are to change this, we must commit to providing the re-sources necessary to build programs that meet basic needs andreduce people's risks of health problems. Funds to provide nutri-tion services in areas now not currently served are needed as wellas to expand services where the demand is currently not being met.As I indicated earlier, we know that an increase in nutritionservices will raise the demand for social services. As mentionedearlier by the last panel, the two go hand-in-hand.We are prepared within the aging network in New Mexico tocommunicate and coordinate with all those involved in a nutritionservices delivery system. We will make every effort to use ourfunds as efficiently and as effectively as possible.33 What we cannot do is generate the financial resources at the State level. Our hope is that these hearings reflect a growing awareness at the national level of the importance of nutrition in maintaining basic quality of life as well as the most cost-effective use of health care dollars. Thank you, Senator Bingaman, for the opportunity to speak before your committee. Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much for that testimony. I appreciate it. [The prepared statement of Ms. Maes follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF RITA B. MAES INTRODUCTION Good morning Senator Bingaman, members of the panel, ladies and gentlemen. I am Rita Maes, Director of the New Mexico State Agency on Aging. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you concerning nutrition and the elderly. Having served as a senior citizens program director for seven years before assuming my current position I am well aware of the operations of local nutrition programs, their success- es and failures and the impact of these services on the elderly. In the historical development of senior citizens programs there has been a shift in emphasis and direction. Early senior centers focused on the social aspects, compan- ionship and recreation. As these centers became popular they began to respond to other needs. Program directors recognized the fact that many older persons could not get to services, did not know what services were available, could not comfortably participate in activities if they were hungry, unhealthy, or were too busy trying to remain independent and alive. The centers responded by supplementing their activi- ties with transportation, information and referral, nutrition and other services. The development of nutrition services both at congregate settings in senior cen- ters and in the home with home delivered meals-meals on wheels, provided a method of addressing several areas of concern. The meals program provided a daily, nutritionally balanced meal. It also provided an opportunity for participant interac- tion, combatting isolation. Having people in one location made it easier to provide other services such as consumer education, nutrition education, counseling and health promotion. The nutrition programs for the elderly have become a key element in the delivery of services to the elderly. The State Agency on Aging remains committed to the con- tinual improvement of the meals program and to efforts to expand the programs. We view the nutrition program not just as a \"feeding\" program but a multi-faceted program which includes the meal, education, health promotion efforts, and other support services. We recognize that nutrition programs must be coordinated with other services and programs outside the aging network that seek to improve the health and nutrition of the elderly. The work of the County Extension Agents, Health and Environment Department Adult Health Services, Human Services De- partment, and American Association of Retired Persons and other advocacy groups all must combine and coordinate to provide the best services to the elderly. We know that we cannot do it by ourselves. THE NEW MEXICO NUTRITION PROGRAM Let me give you some information about the nutrition program for the elderly in New Mexico. My office receives federal and state funds to operate nutrition pro- grams for the elderly in New Mexico. At present we budget, from the federal Older Americans Act, S1,175,902 for congregate meals and $323,144 for home delivered meals. These funds are supplemented by the N.M. State Legislature in an amount of $1,052,809. With these funds it is estimated that 24,000 persons received a total of 1,283.520 congregate meals in the period October 1, 1984 through September 30, 1985. In the same period approximately 6,000 homebound individuals received 459,572 home delivered meals. These dollars represent 16 percent of our total budget-this is a big business. We fund twenty-nine programs in the state to provide these meals. These figures represent only those meals provided with funding from the State Agency on Aging. The Title VI Indian Senior Citizen Programs also serve meals in the various pueblos and reservations. Many community organizations pro-34 vide meals on wheels or similar nutrition services without any federal or state sup-port. The development of the nutrition programs in New Mexico has spanned aboutthirteen years. As you know the programs were first authorized under the OlderAmericans Act in 1972. At that time the state office directly contracted for the pro-grams in the state and a targeting approach was used to develop programs in keyareas of the state. Those early years saw an intense effort to develop programs asquickly as possible and to feed as many people as possible. The first state funds insupport of these efforts were realized in 1974.With the consolidation of programs under the Area Agencies on Aging in 1978, aleveling off of funding began. At this time efforts were made to develop programs insections of the state that had not been targeted by the state office. More emphasiswas placed on the development of nutritionally sound menus, increased training forstaff, development of menus that reflected the cultural preferences of the peoplebeing served, and improvement of the meal preparation process and financial man-agement capabilities. In the 1980's we have continued efforts to increase the capacities of the staff, de-velop better management techniques, and improve the meal preparation process.We have used federal and state training dollars to provide continued training tolocal program directors. The reorganization of the aging network in New Mexicoduring 1982 and 1983 had a considerable impact on these efforts. A reduction instaff in my office resulted in the loss of the person who served as state nutritionist.With the realignment of planning and service areas new area agencies on aging hadto be designated. None of the previous AAA staff were hired, therefore, we have hadto provide much training to the new staff members.As a result we have placed a great burden on local programs to individually beresponsible for the quality of the meals being provided. Local programs have contin-ued to obtain assistance in this area from various sources. Some programs have con-tinued to contract with nutritionists to assist them in menu development that meetsdaily requirements. Other programs have sought the assistance of their county ex-tension staff or nutritionist with local schools, hospitals or other facilities. The newAAA's have also addressed this concern. Two of the AAA's have used short termfunding to hire nutritionists in order to develop nutrition capacity both at the AAAand the local level. Another AAA has intensified an effort to tap the nutrition re-sources of local hospitals and colleges. We have supported these efforts by continu-ing to use training funds to provide nutrition training on a statewide basis. I willcontinue to seek state funds to fund a nutritionist position in my office. In themeantime we have a person with a nursing and health background that will be co-ordinating our statewide efforts. Other staff such as the field representatives contin-ue to work with the AAA's using previously developed resources to monitor andassess the nutrition services currently being provided.The provision of nutrition services in New Mexico has relied heavily on two othersources: USDA commodities program and participant contributions. Until the late 1970's local programs used commodities to assist in meal preparation. Because ofproblems with storage and the over supply of such items as catsup and peanuts, thestate elected to receive cash in-lieu-of commodities. These funds provide half of thedollars necessary to buy raw food. Many of the local programs have assisted in thedistribution of commodity food to the needy. In many cases USDA has allowed theremaining items to be used by the nutritition programs. UNMET AND CONTINUALLY GROWING NEED Any discussion of nutritional services provided by the state must include ourawareness of the increasing need among older persons. Having a meal that meetsone's minimum daily requirements of essential nutrients is often the determiningfactor in whether a senior remains healthy and active or moves into a period of de-teriorating health and dependence. Nutrition is a basic component in the manage-ment of the major chronic diseases-cardiovascular, diabetes, and now cancer. Withthis in mind, it is increasingly important to address nutrition seriously as we devel-op our plans for the future delivery of primary and long term care. Everyone recog-nizes that we must now focus on prevention and risk reduction in health care if weare to make maximal use of our public health care dollar. The prevention of oneperson's institutionalization saves significant dollars that can be used to help manypeople remain in their homes and in their communities. For a detailed discussion ofthe specific nutritional needs of the elderly I refer you back to your 1984 hearing onthe rural elderly and remarks of Pat Cleveland from the N.M. Health and Environ-ment Department.35 It is difficult to estimate in hard numbers the number of people that would access congregate meal programs if there were room for everyone. The Area Agencies on Aging do receive request continually for the expansion of their nutrition sites. For example, Southwest AAA is currently holding two requests to open new sites, with no expectation of increases in funding. This is especially frustrating for them be- cause, as one AAA Director said recently, \"I know it's not just nutrition the seniors in the new sites won't get. It's access to the entire continuum of care.' Let me address this continuum of care to get some sense of how the need for nu- trition services is increasing and will continue to do so in the future. One measure is to look at those needing assistance. Persons who need help with their activities of daily living usually need nutritional services. The inability to prepare a daily meal can mean the difference between living at home or having to be institutionalized. The Home Care Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey conducted during 1979 and 1980, obtained information on the need for assistance in essential personal care and home management activities. The proportion of elderly persons needing help in these areas increases dramatically in the upper age ranges. While only 6 percent of persons in the 65 to 74 age range needed the help of another person this figure doubles to 15.7 percent in the 85 and older age group. By the same token, 34.8 percent of persons 85 plus need help in one or more basic activi- ties, and 26 percent need help going outside the home. Clearly these are the most frail of our aging population. However, they are also those most in need of services such as nutrition so that they do not become dependent on medicaid dollars for ex- pensive, premature institutionalization. This 75 plus group is also the fastest growing segment of the population. By the middle of the next century the relative number of those 75 plus to the total popula- tion-projected to be one out of eight-will be greater than the current proportion of 65 plus individuals to the general population-now one out of nine. These trends have far reaching policy implications because it is these older individuals who have the greatest need for social, income, housing and health services. It is through con- gregate meal sites or home delivered meals that they could gain entry to informa- tion and referral and other systems. Addressing the needs of the \"old\" old does not fully represent the need which nu- trition programs address. Another way to reflect the level of need in New Mexico is to acknowledge the fact that elderly persons in New Mexico live on very low in- comes. The American Association of Retired Persons reported that the median household income of the elderly is only half that of the non-elderly. Elderly women living alone experience a 33 percent poverty rate with 85 to 95 percent of them de- pendent solely on social security or SSI. For minority elderly, projections indicate an over 40 percent poverty rate. The truth is that good food costs money, and when decisions as to whether to be warm or hungry have to be made, the quality of one's nutrition may go down. The provision of one balanced, nutritious meal per day can make a major difference in a low income elderly person's quality of life-not to mention the socialization and access to health services available through nutrition programs. IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As the Director of the State Agency of Aging and as a past director of a local program I wish to present some implications and recommendations for your consid- eration. First, it is now fully recognized that nutrition plays a vital role in the pre- vention and control of disease and in reducing one's risk of minor health problems becoming major, acute, expensive incidents. If we are to truly support this knowl- edge, commitment must be made to providing the funds necessary for elderly nutri- tion programs. Specifically, House Bill 2453, which has passed the House, is now being reviewed in your Committee. It provides valuable assistance to America's low income elderly by increasing the level of assistance per meal in the surplus com- modities program to 56.76 cents. It also repeals the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce the cents-per-meal level. U.S.D.A. Cash in-lieu-of Commodities provide over $800,000 annually to supplement the our nutrition programs. The very recent threat of the per meal reimbursement rate would have negatively affected the number of meals that could be served in New Mexico. We are a small state, can you imagine the impact it would have had in New York or California? It is very important to pass this bill and use it as an indication that the provision of support for life's basic needs will not be eroded by power politics in Washington. Second, I would also recommend that more flexibility be given to the states offices and area agencies in the use of their service dollars. The AAA's cannot readily use these funds to hire a nutritionists. Yet they are primarily responsible for ensuring36 the %uality of nutrition services at the local level. Two AAA's, as mentioned earlier,felt the need to be so great that they used one time funds to hire a nutritionist. Thisis difficult, however, because it's hard to keep someone who knows their fundingWil end in a year. The AAA's very much want to build their education and qualitycontrol programs and should be allowed to use their service dollars to do so.Thirdly we need to recognize the hard work and commitment of other communityprograms in providing nutrition for the elderly. Local groups such as the Storehousein Albuquerque and t~he Emergency Care of the Alliance of Churches provide food insituations of extreme stress or emergencies and are to be commended for what theycan accomplish with very limited resources. Again, this is often a one time, lastminute, acute rescue. It does not provide for the ongoing day by day need that manypeople have. Recognition and appreciation should also be extended to the CountyExtension Agents who voluntarily provide nutrition consultation and education tomany meal sites. This reflects the personal dedication of individual extensionagents. Finally, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important we feel the provisionof nutrition is within the aging services continuum. The United States has a reputa-tion of being a nation that does not prevent fires until it smells smoke. Clearly, weknow we face an aging population in the future and that now is the time to build asystem to meet their needs. We are also aware that acute, primary care uses up themajority of our health care dollars and serves relatively few people. If we are tochange this, we must commit to providing the resources necessary to build programsthat meet basic needs and reduce people's risks of health problems. F rundsto pro-vide nutrition services in areas now not currently served are needed as well as toexpand services where the current demand is currently not being met. As I indicat-ed earlier we know that an increase in nutrition services will raise the demand forsocial services. We are prepared within the aging network in New Mexico to communicate andcoordinate with all those involved in a nutrition services delivery system. We willmake every effort to use our funds as efficiently and effectively as possible. Whatwe can't do is generate the financial resources at the state level. Our hope is thatthese hearings reflect a growing awareness at the national level of the importanceof nutrition in maintaining basic quality of life, as well as the most cost effectiveuse of health care dollars.Thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of New Mexico's elderly. Senator BINGAMAN. We will use the same procedure as beforeand hear from the other panel members before we ask questions.Our next panelist is Sonia Crow who is presently the Associate Ad-ministrator with the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. De-partment of Agriculture in Washington.As I understand it, Sonia is accompanied by Gene Dickey, who isthe Southwest Regional Administrator for the Food and NutritionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture. We appreciate very muchthe Department of Agriculture being represented here today, andwe look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF SONIA F. CROW, WASHINGTON, DC, ASSOCIATEADMINISTRATOR, FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE, USDA, AC-COMPANIED BY GENE DICKEY, SOUTHWEST REGIONAL ADMIN-ISTRATOR, FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE, USDA Ms. CRow. Thank you, Senator Bingaman, members of the audi-ence. It is a pleasure both for Mr. Dickey and myself to be with youtoday in Albuquerque, especially on such a fine day. Obviously, it isan indication of your commitment to the issues raised at this meet-ing that you are spending your time inside this nice building in-stead of out in that beautiful sunshine.So I certainly appreciate the opportunity to talk to people sovery interested in the issues that we are discussing today. Thankyou, Senator, for providing us an opportunity to tell you about theUSDA's involvement in the issues of nutrition and the elderly.37 I have a full statement that some of you may have, and certainly it is available outside if you do not, which I would like to submit for the record. I am going to accept the Senator's suggestion that we try to summarize the statements that we have so we will have more time for your questions and for your comments to us, as well. USDA, as is the Senator, is very interested in hearing from you as to how you feel programs are working for you and what you feel your unmet needs are. Since one of the programs under the jurisdiction of the Food and Nutrition Service, our agency, is the Food Stamp Program, along with a lot of other programs-some of which I will talk to you about today-I want to invite Ms. Lopez and all the other members in this audience who feel that they have been getting the run- around and a lot of red tape to please talk to Mr. Dickey and me and other members that we have today from our field office in Albuquerque. I agree that there is absolutely no reason in the world why the taxpayers in this country don't get the services that are there for them in the Government. You may not always get the answer that you want in terms of whether you qualify or not for a program, but you darn well have a right to get an answer and get it quickly from the people who are here to serve you. So I hope you remember my name. We will be here after the hearing. If you have specific questions, come and talk to us. We will not know all the answers, but we will make sure that you get them and that you get them quickly because I think that is the least that we can do for you. As I said, the USDA, the Food and Nutrition Service, is responsi- ble for administering at the Federal level a very broad array of nu- trition programs that are designed to assist citizens. Babies, even before they are born, all the way to the more senior citizens in our society, and more focused on the issues that you are discussing today. We have many programs-in fact 13 of them-at an annual cost of some $20 billion a year, but what I would like to do, with Mr. Dickey's assistance in answering questions, is to focus just on those that are more directly applicable to the elderly portion of the citi- zens in our country. The three I am going to focus on are the Food Stamp Program, the Elderly Feeding Program, and also the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program-we call it TEFAP because it is less of a mouthful. That is the program that basically has been giving out a lot of commodity distributions for household use, cheese and other commodities. Some of you may have benefited from that program. Let me start with food stamps. The Food Stamp Program, as you know, is the major nutrition assistance program in the United States. We spent annually, last year, a little over $11 billion pro- viding all of our citizens who are in economic need the opportunity to receive food stamp coupons to assist them. Recipients take them to the local grocery and buy the food that they need. This is not a program designed just for elderly, but we do have elderly that participate in it and we have special provi- sions I want to spend a few minutes talking to you about.38 Let me back up a second, though, and explain to you somethingthat is not often understood because it is a little confusing topeople. The Food Stamp Program is a program that is designed tosupplement people's income so that they can go and get adequatefood and a nutritious diet.There is no excuse for anyone in this country to be hungry andnot have adequate food resources. Everyone in this country sup-ports that both morally and through their tax dollars; and certain-ly the USDA also supports that position.What people don't understand, though, is you don't go and getjust a set amount of food stamps. If you're eligible, that does notmean you are eligible for a certain number of coupons.It really depends on how much money you have both in incomeand in terms of assets. So people, perhaps such as Ms. Lopez, mayhave more assets than would qualify them for the program. It's asliding scale type of program.You get a certain amount of food coupons based upon theamount of money that you have: if you have more money, you getless coupons; if you have no money, then you get the maximumbenefit, and the maximum coupon level is designed to give the av-erage person a full month's worth of food coupons to give an ade-quate and nutritious diet.Let me spend just a little time telling you about those specialprovisions in the food stamp law that are specifically designed toassist the elderly population. They apply only to people who are el-derly or who are handicapped. They do not apply to the rest of thepopulation. This is in recognition of the fact that there is a difference and adifferent set of needs and standards for our elderly populationwithin the broader Food Stamp Program. For example, there is adifferent test on whether you qualify or not in terms of net income.It is sort of technical if I go through it so let me just tell you thatthe elderly are treated differently. They are given a break in termsof how their net income is calculated for purposes of determiningwhether they have too much money to be on food stamps or wheth-er they come within the eligibility criteria.There is an attempt to try to make it easier for the elderly to getfood stamps so that elderly people can apply for food stamps attheir local Social Security offices at the same time that they areapplying for Supplemental Security Income benefits.There is a recognition that the elderly in our society have moremedical needs. So there is not the same restriction on medical de-ductions for the elderly as there is for the rest of the population inthe United States. There are special rules that recognize the spe-cial shelter and housing deduction needs of the elderly.There is a higher assets test for how much money you havesaved in the bank: if you are elderly, you can have more money inthe bank that is part of your life savings and you will still be ableto get food stamps than if you were not within that elderly catego-ry. There are no requirements that elderly people in our societysign. up for work employment and job registration as there are withother age categories that are eligible for food stamps.I have done a very, very broad brush stroke. My testimony goesinto that in some further detail and, obviously, you can get a lot39 more information about those special food stamp provisions from your local and state agencies that administer them in each State. Let me spend just a moment, since I think it is perhaps of some interest to you, telling you about what the characteristics are of the elderly food stamp recipient. The data that we have is just a snapshot. In 1982, just remember that, we are quickly approaching 1986 and may I wish you a Merry Christmas as well as the gentleman who so kindly wished it to us on the first panel, and just keep in mind this data is not completely accurate for right now, but it gives us some interesting indications as to who amongst the elderly population is taking advantage of the food stamp benefits that are available to people. First of all, it is interesting to note that households with elderly members account for almost 20 percent of the total food stamp pop- ulation, and that by the way is about 36 million during the course of a year and not quite 20 million per month, but people do not stay on food stamps, necessarily, for a whole year. That is why we have up to about 36 million people a year who get food stamps. While there is 20 percent of elderly within the total food stamp caseload, they don't get 20 percent of the benefits and that is for reasons that, in fact, turn out to be good. That is because they have more money than most of the rest of the people that are in the Food Stamp Program; and I think that is an encouraging sign. So as it turns out they get 8 percent of the total benefits. We do find out that most of the people who are getting food stamps who are elderly are single women who live alone. They do have more income than the general food stamp population. I certainly don't have figures for New Mexico the way Ms. Maes has, but I can tell you that as far as the poverty rate in the United States goes-I think in our society we don't like to think of anyone being in poverty, certainly not anyone being hungry-over the past number of years, I think perhaps one of the most heartening changes that has taken place as a result of a lot of the Government services that the taxpayers have supported in this country is really a remarkably dramatic reduction in the poverty rate for the elder- ly population. For example, in 1970, within the elderly population, over 18 per- cent of the elderly population was what was called in poverty. This is based on a formula. Basically, poverty is defined by the Labor Bureau. It depends on how much income you have. Eighteen percent of our elderly citizens were in poverty. Thir- teen years later-the latest number that I have-actually 1983- just a little over 10 percent were in poverty. Ten percent may still seem like too much, but that change between over 18 to just a little over 10 is almost a 40 percent reduction. That is, statistically, a remarkable change and I think a tribute to the types of programs that are available through the Govern- ment. These programs have had a very, very dramatic impact on the well-being of the elderly in our society. Obviously, there is a long way to go. That is apparent from the testimony of the people on the first panel. But there has been a lot of progress in this country.40 I think it's important that we keep that in mind when we arejudging the effectiveness of the programs we are talking abouttoday and what should be done in the future to know that, at leastas a baseline and as a framework, so much has already been doneto assist that important segment of our society that makes up ourelderly population. Let me go on and tell you just a little bit about some of the otherprograms that are specifically designed for the elderly. You aregoing to have more testimony on that so I am just going to skimover it. It has been touched on already.Those have to do with the elderly feeding programs, both thecongregate feeding programs where the elderly get together andhave an opportunity to have a meal which is provided free if theycannot make a donation toward that meal, or in certain cases ifthey are homebound to have meals brought to them; the meals-on-wheels programs that are administered through other agencies, notUSDA. We are involved in those programs because we received Federalfunds from Congress for those programs and then turn them overto State agencies. This last year, USDA gave in contribution forthose congregate feeding programs not quite $121 million.These funds go to support the congregate programs and to hope-fully help subsidize the provision of meals to those who are home-bound and cannot go out and join the rest of all of you in enjoyingthe food that is provided. In addition, in that TEFAP Program that I told you about, theTemporary Emergency Program, we do provide a lot of commod-ities to households, that are packaged for household use. Most ofyou know about them as the cheese giveaways. They were institut-ed in December 1981 by President Reagan and have continued tothis date, and they have provided throughout the country, since1981, literally billions of pounds of food to people who can take ithome and use it to help supplement their diets and provide betternutrition for their families. In addition to cheese, we give flour, rice, butter, nonfat dry milkwhich is important, honey and cornmeal. I know that just this lastyear New Mexico received over 7 million pounds of food for distri-bution to households. Let me go on and talk about a subject in which I have no exper-tise whatsoever. So I am going to have to rely a lot on my notes,but it is a very important part of what USDA does.That has to do with human nutrition research and the elderlyAs I said, I have provided for the record more detailed, more tech-nical testimony which you may want to review. Quite honestly, Iam going to have to short circuit that a little bit. I cannot pro-nounce half the words that are in the text so you are just going tohave to help me out on this, but let me briefly review for you-Senator BINGAMAN. Let me interrupt just for a second. We wantto hear this, but we are running late, and I am in the difficult situ-ation of having another panel after we finish with this one.So if you could make it relatively short, I would appreciate it.Thank you. Ms. CROw. I will be more than delighted, as I said, since I haveno expertise in this, to be extremely short.41 Senator BINGAMAN. Why don't we take a short break. [Short recess.] Ms. CRow. The USDA, through its Agricultural Research Serv- ice, supports the largest research unit in the United States devoted exclusively to nutrition and to aging studies A new 15-story building to house USDA's Human Nutrition Re- search Center on Aging was completed in 1982, and is located im- mediately adjacent to Tufts in Boston. The USDA operates this center as a Government-owned contract-operated facility through a contract with Tufts University. It contains a 28-bed metabolic re- search unit. It is one of the largest in the United States, and it is the largest unit that is devoted exclusively to nutrition and aging studies. Over 30 scientists and 100 scientific support personnel are housed at the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at the present and are doing some very, very valuable work. The mission of this Center is to examine the relationship of nu- trition to the aging process throughout adult life, and to determine the dietary needs of elderly people. The Center's scientists are de- termining the ways in which diet and nutrition status influence the onset and the progression of aging. They are employing experi- ments with animals, tissue cultures, and human subjects. They are looking at three general questions: how does nutrition influence progressive loss of tissue function with aging; what is the role of nutrition in the genesis of major chronic degenerative condi- tions associated with the aging process, and the ones most of us would know about have to do with bone mineral loss and visual dis- orders. Lastly, they are focusing on the nutrition requirements nec- essary to maintain the optimal functional well-being of older people. As I said, some of the specific research outcomes are listed for you in my written testimony-for those of you who can understand it. If you cannot, I would like you to contact us and we will try to put the information into layman's English for you and see if we can help all of us understand the research goals better because they are so very important to all of us. I thank you very much, Senator. [The prepared statement of Ms. Crow follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SONIA F. CROW Thank you for your invitation to appear in Albuquerque, Senator Bingaman, to discuss the role played by USDA in contributing to the nutritional well-being of older Americans. I am pleased to be a part of this field hearing and will attempt to describe our efforts in this important field of program activity. The principal program arm of USDA which provides nutritional services is my agency, the Food and Nutrition Service. It administers thirteen programs providing food and nutrition assistance to populations ranging from pregnant women and in- fants to school-age children to persons in charitable institutions to reservation Indi- ans to those simply with low incomes. Three of these programs have national sig- nificance for the elderly: the Food Stamp Program, the Elderly Feeding Program, and the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program. FOOD STAMPS AND THE ELDERLY The Food Stamp Program is a nationwide program which helps low-income people purchase more nutritious diets. Assistance is provided in the form of coupons that can be redeemed for food at over 230,000 authorized grocery stores and other out-42 lets. The program is administered at the Federal level by the Food and NutritionService of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and at the State and local levels byState or county social service departments. These social service departments use fed-eral standards to determine the eligibility and benefit levels of applicants and issuebenefits monthly. Families and individuals may be eligible if their monthly income and resourcesare low and they meet a limited number of nonfinancial criteria. Benefit levels arebased on household size and income available for purchasing food after other ex-penses are considered. For the period October 1985 through September 1986, an in-dividual living alone may receive up to $80 a month, a two-person household up to$147 a month, and a four-person household up to $268 a month. The program pro-vided about 19.9 million people in 7.3 million households with $10.8 billion in bene-fits during Fiscal Year 1985. The average monthly benefit was about $45 per person.The Food Stamp Program contains special provisions to address the needs of theelderly, that is, persons age 60 or over. These provisions include the following:Net income test.-Households without elderly or disabled persons have their eligi-bility based on their gross and net incomes and their level of benefits on their netincome after the allowable dedutions are subtracted. By contrast, households withelderly or disabled members have both their elibility and level of benefits based onthe lower net income amount.Joint processing.-Elderly persons can apply for food stamps at local social securi-ty offices at the time they apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.Medical deductions.-Households with a member who is 60 or older may deductall medical expenses that exceed $35 a month for its elderly or disabled persons.Shelter deductions.-Food stamp rules permit households with elderly or disabledpersons to deduct all shelter costs over 50 percent of the household's adjustedincome. Households without elderly or disabled persons have limited shelter deduc-tions. Higher allowable assets.-The Food Stamp Program allows households of two ormore persons, one of whom is 60 years of age or older, to have up to $3,000 in assetsand remain eligible. All other households are allowed only $1,500.Dependent care deductions for working adults.-Food stamp households maydeduct up to $139 per month for the care of an elderly or disabled persons whensuch care enables a household member to accept or continue employment, or to par-ticipate in training or education preparatory to employment. Work registration exemption.-The elderly are exempt from the program's workregistration as well as the other work requirements, such as Job Search.Periodic reporting exemption-Elderly persons who have no earned income andwho live alone or with others all of whom are elderly or disabled and have noearned income are not required to file reports under periodic reporting/retrospec-tive accounting systems. Household definition.-Elderly parents or siblings are exempt from the require-ment that parents and children or siblings who live together must be considered asone household for food stamp application purposes. In addition, those elderly per-sons who live with others of moderate income and who are unable to prepare theirown meals because of ill health may be certified separately from those with whomthey live. on~gregate dining facilities and home delivery of meals.-USDA may authorizenon-profit food service programs to accept food stamps from the elderly and disabledin payment for meals. Such food service programs may include congregate diningfacilities and services that deliver meals to homes.In addition, States may contract with restaurants to offer meals at low or reducedprices to elderly food stamp participants. When approved by USDA, such restau-rants may accept food stamps for meals.Although it is not a special program provision, I should mention that severalareas that participated in a special project designed to test the feasibility of provid-ing the elderly with cash in lieu of their food coupon benefit continue to issuechecks. Food Stamp Program eligibility requirements limit participation to the needy andthe amount of benefits available increases as the degree of need increases. Specifi-cally, households with elderly members must have spendable income at or below thepoverty line. This line is now $438 per month for a one-person household and $588per month for a two-person household. Spendable income is determined by sub-tracting allowable expenses (such as high shelter or medical expenses) from cashincome. In 1983, about 90% of food stamp households with elderly members hadmonthly cash incomes below the poverty line. About 99% had monthly cash incomesbelow 125% of the poverty line.43 The size of the food stamp allotment varies according to household size and foodpurchasing power as measured by net income. Currently, the maximum benefits is$80 for a one-person household and $147 for a two-person household. Maximum ben-efits are reduced by $30 of net income. That is because a household is expected touse that amount of its own money for its food bills, with food coupons covering theremaining amount. For example, a one-person household with no net income gets$80 a month. If the household's net income increases to $200, the food stamp allot- ment falls to $20 a month.What can we say about the characteristics of elderly food stamp recipients? Themost detailed information we have is from a 1982 study of Food Stamp Programhousehold characteristics. That study found that households with elderly membersaccounted for almost 20 percent of the total food stamp caseload in August, 1982,but since they were smaller on average and had relatively higher income, they re-ceived less than 8 percent of all benefits issued that month, Over 44 percent of allone-person households were elderly (that is, single elderly persons living alone orcertified as a separate food stamp unit within a larger household). Eighty-eight per-cent of all elderly participants either lived by themselves or with one other person.Nearly 69 percent of all elderly households were headed by women, about 56 per-cent were single elderly women living alone and 13 percent were living with others.After adjusting for the differences in household size, households with elderlymembers had relatively higher income than those without elderly members. Aver-age gross income per person was nearly twice as high among the elderly as all otherprogram participants. Similarly, the average net income per person in elderlyhouseholds was double that found in other households. Thus, average benefits perperson for the elderly were about two-thirds of the average benefits for the non-el-derlv. A further indication of the higher incomes received by elderly program par-ticipants is the fact that 29 percent of elderly households in 1982 received the mini-mum $10 benefit, compared to 2 percent of the households without elderly persons.About 88 percent of the elderly households had income from either Social Securi-ty or SSI. About 35 percent had income from both. Only 2 percent of elderly house-holds reported the absence of all income. As might be expected, only 6 percent of elderly households reported earned income. MONITORING FOOD STAMP PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS FNS operated two systems to monitor program effectiveness: the quality control(QC) system and the management evaluation (ME) system. These systems serve thepurpose of ensuring that the Food Stamp Program operates as the law and regula-tions specify and that program benefits go to those for whom they are intended.The QC system is designed to measure the accuracy of payments to householdsand determine the extent of payment errors. States are required each month to in-tensively review a random sample of cases to measure payments to ineligible house-holds, overpayments, underpayments, and denials or terminations of eligible house-holds. FNS reviews part of each State's sample to validate error rates. The systemassesses how well States are gearing payments to household circumstances. Thesystem produces extensive management information which forms the basis for Fed-eral fiscal sanctions or incentives and for State corrective action plans.The ME system assesses State administrative operations to ensure that local certi-fication and issuance offices are meeting Federal and State guidelines. States arerequired to review a sample of their offices each year to ensure that procedural re-quirements are being met. FNS oversees these State efforts. These reviews assesssuch areas as application processing, notice to households, and restoration of lost benefits. ELDERLY FEEDING PROGRAM Through the Food Distribution Program, USDA donates foods and cash in lieu offoods to help meet the nutritional needs of the elderly. Specifically, this programsubsidizes meals through the Elderly Feeding Program of the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services [HHS]. This program was authorized under the OlderAmericans Act of 1965, as amended, to provide nutritious meals for elderly people.HIS gives grants to State Agencies on Aging, which designate Area Agencies onAging (AAA) to plan and coordinate the nutrition program through providers of nu- trition service at the local level.These State Agencies on Aging receive cash, donated food, or a combination ofboth to provide meals to the elderly at various sites. The amount of food or cashthat USDA gives each State is based on the number of meals served in the programand the level of assistance per meal authorized by legislation. Total program costs44 also are limited by authorizing legislation and appropriations. Initially, USDA sup-port for the program was provided in donated foods. This aided USDA with its pricesupport and surplus removal activities as well as provided direct support for themeals served in the program. However, once legislation authorized cash in lieu ofdonated foods, the program increasingly became a cash transfer program. In fact,presently less than five percent of USDA meal support is provided in donated foods.The remaining support is in the form of cash. The current authorization for FiscalYear 1985 is $120.8 million. These elderly nutrition services are provided in schools, community centers,churches, public housing, and other places accessible to the majority of local elderlypeople. By statute, the AAA provides nutritious, well-balanced meals at least once aday, 5 or more days a week. The AAA will also provide transportation to and fromthe sites for those who need it, when possible. Similarly, the AAA will providehome-delivered meals at least once a day, 5 or more days a week, when possible, toolder people who are homebound.Eligibility requires only that a person be 60 years of age or older and theirspouses, regardless of age, may participate in the program. In addition, while eachprovider of nutrition service suggests appropriate contributions, each person decideswhat he or she is willing to contribute toward the cost of the meal. The meals arefree to eligible persons if they do not wish to make a contribution.I should point out, Senator Bingaman, that the Administration proposed legisla-tion in 1984 to transfer funding of the Elderly Feeding Program from USDA to HHSso that one agency, instead of two, would have responsibility for it. FOOD DISTRIBUTION FOR THE ELDERLY Additionally, the USDA offers food assistance to elderly people through the FoodDistribution Program for charitable institutions (e.g., soup kitchens and nursinghomes). The elderly may also receive available surplus food through the TemporaryEmergency Food Assistance Program. These two programs do not restrict any recip-ient from participating based upon age; economic need is the only requirement.The Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) gives needy Ameri-cans, including low-income and unemployed persons, USDA-doniated foods for house-hold use. The foods are free but recipients must meet certain minimal eligibility cri-teria. A temporary program, TEFAP is authorized by Title II of Public Law 98-8, asamended (the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983). The precursor ofTEFAP began in December 1981, when President Reagan initiated the donation ofsurplus foods directly to needy persons in households through nonprofit organiza-tions and food banks. With implementation of the Food Stamp Program on a nation-wide basis, such donations had been discontinued after June 30, 1974.Food distributed by TEFAP has been declared surplus after certain other commit-ments have been met by USDA. Items vary from time to time depending on whatproducts are in surplus and other factors. During the lifespan of TEFAP, these haveincluded cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, corn meal, flour, rice and honey. USDAprovides these foods in package sizes that are suitable for household use.In each State, USDA enters into agreements with the agency responsible for ad-ministering the program. The State agency selects public or nonprofit emergencyfeeding organizations such as food banks and delivers the foods to them. These orga-nizations then distribute the food to needy persons.Besides buying the food, processing and packaging it, and shipping it to theStates, USDA also provides funds to State agencies to help defray costs incurred bythem or by local organizations. These funds may be used to store and distribute thefood. At least 20 percent of these funds must be reserved for use by the local feedingorganizations to help meet their costs in giving the food to needy persons.USDA currently makes the following commodities available on a monthly basis toStates for household distribution:Cheese, 35 million pounds; flour, 10 million pounds; rice, 10 million pounds;butter, 6 million pounds; nonfat dry milk, 7 million pounds; honey, 6 millionpounds; and corn meal, 3 million pounds.During Fiscal Year 1985, USDA made a total of over 934 million pounds of sur-plus foods available to States for distribution to needy households. New Mexico re-ceived 7,049,372 pounds of food at a total cost of $7,363,980. Since the beginning ofTEFAP, New Mexico has received 21,773,988 pounds of food at a cost of $25,259,791.For the entire U.S., the amount of surplus food and its value since TEFAP began is2,629,365,380 pounds at a cost of $3,132,604,057.45 In many cases, information about distribution and eligibility can be found in localnewpapers or over the radio. The day-to-day program operations are administeredby the State agency and local organizations. HUMAN NUTRITION RESEARCH AND T}HE ELDERLY Your letter of invitation, Senator Bingaman, also expressed interest in USDAHuman Nutrition Research Programs, especially as they apply to the elderly. Whilenutrition research is beyond my sphere of expertise, I can report several develop-ments to you thanks to information generously supplied by other USDA agencies.USDA, through its Agricultural Research Service (ARS) supports the largest re-search unit in the U.S. devoted exclusively to nutrition and aging studies.The Agriculture Appropriations Bill of 1978 instructed the Department of Agricul-ture to establish an \"adult human nutrition research facility at Tufts University inMassachusetts.\" A new 15-story building to house USDA's Human Nutrition Re-search Center on Aging was completed in 1982. The building provides 200,000square feet of space and is located adjacent to the Health Sciences Campus of TuftsUniversity and the New England Medical Center in downtown Boston. The USDAoperates this Center as a Government-Owned, Contract-Operated facility, through acontract with Tufts University. The Center contains a 28-bed Metabolic ResearchUnit, which is one of the largest in the U.S., and certainly the largest unit devotedexclusively to nutrition and aging studies. Over 30 scientists and 100 scientific sup-port personnel are housed in the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging atpresent.The mission of the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging is to examine therelationship of nutrition to the aging process throughout adult life and to determine the dietary needs of elderly people. Center scientists are determining the ways in which diet and nutrition status influence the onset and progresion of aging-em- ploying experimental animals, tissue cultures, and human subjects for such studies. They are exploring ways in which diet, alone and in association with other factors,can delay or prevent the onset of degenerative conditions commonly associated withthe aging process. The research will determine nutrient requirements during agingand the ways in which an optimal diet, in combination with other factors, may pro-vide health and vigor over the life span of humans.Scientists at the Center are addressing three general questions:How does nutrition influence progressive loss of tissue function with aging?What is the role of nutrition in the genesis of major chronic degenerative condi-tions associated with the aging process such as bone mineral loss and visual disor- ders?What are the nutrient requirements necessary to maintain the optimal functionalwell-being of older people?The research areas being investigated at the Center include the following:Nutrition and Aging in Skin-Derived Cells; Relation between Functional Capacity,Body Composition and Nutrient Needs; Role of Nutrition and Free Radical Reac-tions in Age and Drug Associated Changes; Role of Micro-nutrients on Neuropsycho-logical Functions Throughout the Life Cycle; Lipoproteins, Nutrition and Aging-, Nu-trition, Aging and Cardiovascular Metabolism and Function; Role of NutritionalFactors in Preventing Age-Related Loss of Bone Density; Effects of Nutrition andAging on Lens Proteins and Proteases; Nutrition Epidemiology and Aging; Micro-Nutrient Requirements of the Elderly; Macro-Nutrient Requirements of the Elderly;and Bioavailability of Nutrients in the Elderly.I am submitting examples of recent research findings, briefly described in techni-cal language, for the record. NUTRITION INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE ELDERLY There are a number of USDA-sponsored activities which provide nutrition-relatedinformation and assistance to the elderly, and I will briefly describe some of them.A major initiative at the Food and Nutrition Service has been \"Make Your FoodDollars Count\", a nutrition information project for low-income consumers. Thisproject provides information through State extension offices, State departments ofealth and welfare, and State food stamp offices which is useful for low-income el-derly households. \"Make Your Food Dollars Count\" was officially introduced at USDA's Food and Fitness Fair in August, 1984, and at a series of regional work-sosaround the countntrhelhe project is designed tohelp low-income families, particularly food stamp users,buy and prepare more nutritious and less expensive foods. Work began on theproject in November, 1983, when a U.S. Department of Agriculture Nutrition Educa-46 tion Task Force was formed to identify the skills and nutrition information needed by low-income individuals to enable them to get the most food and nutrition for every dollar spent. A variety of materials has been developed. Pamphlets on shopping skills and nu- trition are available through State and local food stamp offices on such topics as: comparing food brands; buying convenience foods compared with preparing them at home; shopping with unit prices; understanding food labels- eating a variety of foods; choosing nutritious snacks; finding the best meat buys; and planning ahead to make your food dollars count. Posters, radio public service announcements, newspaper reproducibles, messages on the food stamp coupon booklet, workshops, and a slide/cassette tape presentation are also being used to get the nutrition message directly to food stamp users and other low-income consumers. At the introductory workshops, USDA Extension Serv- ice agents, personnel from State departments of health and welfare, nutritionists, dietitians, and staff from food stamp offices learned about the nutrition information project. They are now using the project materials in their work with low-income households. The pamphlets are free to food stamp users, State and local food stamp offices, Extension EFNEP offices and others working with food stamp users. All others pay modest fees and order the pamphlets from the Superintendent of Documents. The Government Printing Office (GPO) is making the pamphlets available to all interested consumers, regardless of income. The pamphlets are available in sets of four at $2.00 per set. Two compatible brightly colored posters, 17\" x 22\", are avail- able for $3.50 each. One says, \"Buy Better ' and the other, \"Eat Better.\" Another arm of USDA, the Extension Service plays a significant role in promot- ing nutrition education and good health for the elderly. Its programs are conducted to help older people live independently and have a choice of lifestyle and living ar- rangements. There is variation from State to State. Several examples of activity from selected States follow: NEW MEXICO Programs designed to increase the quality of health, longevity and safety in one- half of the State's counties, reached more than 1,781 adults and 940 children through 264 volunteers in 25 program events. Five counties reported multi-agency Health Fairs, one of which was specifically a \"Senior Citizen Health Fair\". Health Fairs help identify agencies and services for the elderly and provide inexpensive screening procedures including height/weight relationships, blood pressure, hearing tests, vision tests, glaucoma check, and dental exams. Blood samples were taken for tests to determine risks for diabetes, anemia, high levels of cholesterol, blood sugar, and triglicerides. Use of computer technology in Cooperative Extension Service offices also facili- tates services to seniors. All County Extension Home Economists have been trained and have available a Computerized Nutrition Analysis program that can be used ona one-to-one basis with seniors and provide recommendations for improving nutri- tion. This program has also been utilized to analyze menus at Senior Nutrition Sites and provide recommendations for improvement. Another county used a computer- ized \"Lifestyle Awareness\" program and provided all program participants with an analysis of habits and ways to improve longevity. Other county program examples include training Senior Companion Volunteers on nutrition and health for the elderly, programs at county Senior Centers on \"Keep Moving to Stay Healthy\", special newsletters on health, features in regular county newletters on diet, health and fitness, and using Dairy Council representa- tives for public programs on osteoporosis. PENNSYLVANIA Twentl-two nutrition peer-educators were recruited from seven counties by the county home economists and Area Agency on Aging staff members. They were trained to teach lessons on the \"Fat-Controlled Diet,\" \"Shopping For Nutritious Bargains\" and peer-educators conducted 95 education ses- sions for 933 elderly persons. The methodology and program resources were shared with many Area Agencies on Aging and Extension leaders across the Nation. GEORGIA Extension State staff members have enlisted the assistance of hospital and Public Health Department nurses in conducting training for Caregivers for Dependent47 Adults. Included in the training are segments on \"Nutrition,\" \"Infection Controland Hygiene\" and \"Communicating With Family Members.\" Some Caregivers areproviding respite for a family member, some are employed, and others are providingcare for a family member. PENNSYLVANIA AND OKLAHOMA Senior citizens receive a bimonthly newsletter from the State Extension officeproviding health and nutrition information. ALABAMA Twelve area meetings were held to present the latest information on arthritis in-cluding proper treatment such as diet, exercise and medicines. Recognizing quack-ery and early warning signs were emphasized and the 2,000 participants indicatedthat new knowledge was gained. RHODE ISLAND Extension Specialist developed/prepared five 2Vz minute public service announce-ment (PSA's] for 15 radio stations broadcasts giving information on wise eating andexercises to delay and prevent osteoporosis. The CES nutritionists and an exercise therapist conducted diet and exercise ses-sions for 175 adults at 30 meal sites in Providence. They also presented similar pro-grams for AARP and \"Leisure and Learning' groups.For your information, I have provided you and your staff with copies of variousUSDA and State Extension Service publications which are used with elderly popula-tions. That completes my formal remarks, Senator Bingaman. I will be happy to re-spond to questions. Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much also. Mr. Dickey, didyou have some comments you want to make? Mr. DICKEY. No, I do not, Senator. Thank you. Senator BINGAMAN. All right. Our next witness then is Dr. Evan Hadley who is the Chief of theGeriatrics Branch of the National Institute on Aging, Departmentof Health and Human Services in Maryland. And, doctor, we are pleased to have you here in Albuquerque,and look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF EVAN HADLEY, M.D., CHIEF, GERIATRICS BRANCH, NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING, HHS, ROCKVILLE, MD Dr. HADLEY. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this veryimportant topic. I will summarize my statement. Since NIA's re-search on nutrition is aimed at ways people can improve their ownnutrition, it's useful to discuss it in terms of some practical ques-tions about nutrition and aging. There are many questions aboutthe best diet for people to maintain good health. Currently peoplehave become especially aware of the connection between diet andprevention of osteoporosis. As you know, osteoporosis is a diseasewhich causes loss of bone strength and is mainly a disease of theelderly. Because osteoporosis predisposes to hip fracture, it's amajor cause of death and disability among the elderly. Over200,000 people in the United States suffer a hip fracture each yearand at least 20 percent die from complications of the fracture andanother 20 percent remain unable to walk. The disability from hipfracture is expensive too-the annual costs resulting from hip frac-ture are over $7 billion. We have made some progress with nutritional approaches to pre-venting osteoporosis. There is more and more evidence that the48 current recommended dietary allowance for calcium of 800 milli- grams per day is probably too low for preventing osteoporosis in women. Recently an NIH panel recommended intakes of 1,000- 1,500 milligrams a day. We still need to know more about calcium needs of the elderly who often have impaired calcium absorption and do not absorb it that well through the digestive tract. We also need to know a lot more about vitamin D needs of the elderly. There is good reason to believe that the elderly may need higher levels of vitamin D. On the more positive side, I think there is be- ginning to be some evidence that osteoporosis can be treated or at least its progress slowed or arrested by calcium and vitamin D sup- plementation. We still need to know a lot more, but it is a hopeful sign. Another strategy being pursued at the National Institute on Aging in terms of nutrition and aging is to try to prevent diseases of late life through good nutrition throughout the life span, in addi- tion to treating them once they have already developed late in life. I think a heartening example of this kind of approach is the de- cline in recent years in circulating levels of cholesterol which, as you know, is a major risk factor for heart disease. One of the inter- esting things researchers have found out is that changes in the die- tary factors that are known to effect cholesterol, only explain a rel- atively small amount of the drop in cholesterol, which suggests that there may be other dietary factors that we do not yet under- stand that effect cholesterol. If we could find out what they are, we might be able to get cho- lesterol levels down still further. I think this kind of nutritional ap- proach-looking for dietary factors over the lifespan that can be helpful in preventing diseases in late life-is a very important pri- ority, both at NIA and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health. Another broad area of questions about nutrition and aging cen- ters on the issue of whether or not older people are getting nutri- tionally adequate diets. I think this issue can be looked at in a lot of ways. Maybe the most straightforward way is: Are people at least get- ting the recommended dietary allowance for various nutrients? As has been said before, there is a fair amount of evidence that even healthy people living at home are not getting the recommended di- etary allowances of many nutrients, including vitamin B6, vitamin D and calcium, and several others. But I think an even more basic question is: How much of various nutrients is enough for older persons, and do these requirements change with age? To answer that question, we really need fairly long-term studies, in many cases, of the effect of different levels of various nutrients in the body. For example, we are supporting a study comparing dif- ferent levels of zinc intake in older persons to see if higher levels of zinc can improve immune function or resistance to disease, as has been suggested by some earlier studies. Another reason that requirements for nutrients may change with age is, as Dr. Blumberg has already mentioned, absorption and regulation by the body of nutrients' changes with age. These49 changes may play a role in contributing to, for example, vitamin B12deficiency in a small but significant percentage of older people.Vitamin B12deficiency is particularly important because, in cer-tain cases, it can lead to neurologic disorders, including dementia.Now, the number of cases of dementia that are related to vitamin B12deficiency is uncertain, and it is probably only a small percent-age of dementia cases, but I think it is particularly important tolearn more about this because vitamin B12deficiency is a potential-ly treatable cause of dementia in persons who might otherwise beassumed to have Alzheimer's disease. Because nutritional needs may change with age, it may be thatwe need to adjust the recommended dietary allowances for manynutrients to take into account these changes. As we said, to do thiswill take long-term studies. NIH has begun discussions with theNational Academy of Sciences, which issues the RDA's, to plan re-search for how this can be done. Finally, I want to also recognize the point that the elderly are avery mixed group-that there are obvious differences betweenpeople in their sixties and people in their eighties-and we need toknow much more about the nutritional needs of the oldest old. It isthe fastest growing segment of the population and the most at riskfor disease. I think it is also important to realize that we could learn a lotabout nutrition in a positive way from the oldest old. I think thatpeople who survive to a healthy old age may do so in large partbecause of their diet. If we could compare the diets of people who survived to healthyold age with those who have not fared so well, we might learn a lotabout ways to assure good health well into late life.Because this is such an important topic, NIA has begun a pro-gram specifically focused on research on the oldest old. This is notconfined to nutrition, but nutrition is a major part of our interestin that area. I want to say one thing about the scope of our efforts in nutritionand aging. It is a priority with us, and we are somewhat frustratedin the many questions that we still need to answer about nutritionand aging. I think that one of the problems has been that there has reallybeen a lack of well-trained researchers who are working in agingand nutrition. At NIA, we have begun a program to try to trainand develop these kinds of researchers so that we can get answersto these questions. In my written testimony, I have also included a description ofNIA's public education programs in nutrition and other PublicHealth Service programs in nutrition education. I would be glad to answer any questions that you have.Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.[The prepared statement of Dr. Hadley follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF EVAN C. HADLEY, M.D. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Dr. Evan Hadley, Chief ofthe Geriatrics Branch at the National Institute on Aging [NIA]. Thank you for theopportunity to present information about nutrition and aging and on NIA and otherdepartmental activities related to this issue.50 RESEARCH ON NUTRITION AND AGING; RECENT FINDINGS AND FUTURE NEEDS The National Institutes of Health [NIH] is the major agency in the Federal Gov- ernment that supports research and training in nutrition as it relates to health maintenance, human development throughout the life cycle, disease prevention and disease treatment. This research is supported by all 11 NIH Institutes, and other NIH components. The National Institute on Aging's nutrition program supports research on the role of nutrition in preventing or treating medical problems of late life. Since this research is ultimately focused on ways in which people can improve their nutrition, it is useful to discuss it in terms of some practical questions about aging and nutri- tion. The most commonly asked questions concern the optimal intake of specific nutri- ents and total calories for maintaining good health in older persons. A few examples illustrate our knowledge and needs for research: A topic of great current interest is the role of nutrition in preventing osteoporosis, which is mainly a disease of the elderly. The great majority of elderly women and many elderly men suffer from osteoporosis, which is a major cause of the over 200,000 hip fractures occurring annually in this U.S. Hip fracture is a major cause of death and disability among the elderly and results in costs of over $7 billion per year. Calcium, vitamin D, and probably other nutrients are important in protecting against osteoporosis. We have come to realize that the present Recommended Die- tary Allowance for calcium is probably too low for most women, especially after menopause when they are most at risk for this disease. Recently an NIH panel rec- ommended calcium intakes ranging from 1000 to 1500 milligrams per day for pre- vention of osteoporosis in women. However, we still need to know more on this point, especially about the optimal amount of calcium in the diet of the elderly, who tend to absorb it less well from the digestive tract. Research supported by NIA at the University of Washington suggests that calcium and vitamin D supplements may be helpful in some older persons who have already developed osteoporosis. The optimum number of calories to consume is an important issue for all age groups. Currently, the recommended energy intake for persons declines as they get older, because energy expenditure tends to decrease with age. However, these rec- ommendations need to be reconsidered in the light of evidence that moderate exer- cise is useful in preventing or treating diabetes, osteoporosis, and possibly other problems in the elderly. If increased exercise is indeed helpful, we may need to adjust the recommended intake of calories upward for those elderly who are able to engage in moderate or vigorous exercise. In view of the fact that obesity is a known risk factor for many diseases, this issue is very important and needs very careful study before any firm conclusions can be drawn. It is also worth noting that we need to consider nutrition over the entire lifespan, not just for the elderly, when thinking about preventing diseases of old age. For many diseases of the elderly, prevention through good nutrition earlier in life is more effective than trying to remedy advanced disease later. This should be reflect- ed in recommended nutrient intakes for all ages. The significant drop in circulating cholesterol levels in recent years illustrates how risk factors for diseases of later life can be changed. NIA researchers have found that the nutritional factors presently known to affect cholesterol levels, such as body weight and fat intake, account for only a small part of the recent decline. This suggests that other dietary factors, as yet unknown, may help to reduce choles- terol levels. Identifying such factors in the diet of the young and middle-aged which can protect against diseases of later life is an important research priority at NIA and other NIH Institutes. A second major question is whether the elderly are consuming nutritionally ade- quate diets. Because the elderly tend to eat less than younger persons, they run a special risk of not consuming enough of specific vitamins and minerals. NIA-sup- ported studies at the University of New Mexico suggest that many elderly persons living at home may have inadequate intakes of vitamins B6, D, E, and folic acid. As noted above, calcium intakes of many older persons may also be inadequate. Often we are hampered in deciding whether or not a certain daily intake of a nu- trient is adequate for older persons because we do not know the long-term effects of various dietary levels. This is a pressing area for research on such factors as zinc, vitamin D and many others. NIA is supporting a study by researchers in New Jersey to determine the effect of various levels of zinc in the diet of older persons on immune function and protection from infections. Changes with age in the absorp- tion and regulation of nutrients in the body may also affect nutritional require-51 ments. Such changes may contribute to the presence of vitamin l32 deficiency in asmall but significant percentage of the elderly. This is particularly noteworthy sincethis deficiency may contribute to neurologic problems, including dementia in some cases. Though the frequency of vitamin B12deficiency as a contributor to dementia is not clear, it is important to investigate this possibility, since it is a potentiallytreatable cause of this devastating disability in persons who might otherwise be as- sumed to have Alzheimer's disease. Because of the above considerations, the Recommended Dietary Allowances [RDA's) for various nutrients may need to be adjusted further for the elderly. Formany nutrients, the information to determine this has not yet been obtained, and will require intensive long-term research. The NIA has been collaborating with theNational Academy of Sciences in planning a comprehensive approach to evaluatingthe RDA's for the elderly. It is important to recognize that the elderly are a very diverse group. It is highlylikely that nutritional requirements may change considerably between the ages of 65 and 85. We need to know much more about the nutritional needs of the popula-tion over 85 years of age, the fastest growing segment of the elderly who are most atrisk of disease. We should also remember that there may be much to learn from thevery elderly about nutrition in a positive way. It is quite likely that persons who live to a healthy advanced age do so in part because of their diet. By comparing thediets of these healthy elderly with those who have not fared so well, we may learnmuch about the optimal nutrition for a long and healthy life. For all the above rea- sons, NIA has introduced a program of research specifically focused on the popula- tion aged over 85. Though the field of nutrition and aging is a priority, it presently accounts for amodest sharp of NIH nutrition research: In FY 1984, NI research on nutrition andthe elderly amounted to $7.8 million, of which $4.8 million was supported by NIA.This was 4 percent of the total NIH nutrition expenditures of $193 million. Onemajor problem is the lack of trained researchers in the field of nutrition and aging. NIA has begun a program to develop high-quality researchers who can begin toanswer the many important questions that remain about nutrition and aging. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS Nutrition education is carried out on a continuing basis as part of the NIA's public information program. The objectives of the program are to inform elderlypeople, their families, health care workers, agencies concerned with aging, thepress, and other about the nutritional needs of older people and research findings inthe field of nutrition and aging. The NIA Public Information Office prepares anddistributed general fact sheets on nutrition (see attached), including four AgePages-widely distributes, simply written, one-page fact sheets that deal directlywith nutrition. Seven hundred fifty thousand copies of each nutritional Age Page were originally distributed. These Age Pages have also been translated into Spanishthrough a joint effort by the Public Information Office and the National Associationof Spanish Speaking Elderly. The Public Information Office also prepares news releases and summaries of re-search projects, and responds to telephone and letter inquiries from the public andprofessionals working in the field of aging. The large number of public, professional,and press requests related to nutrition basically fall into ten categories: calcium/ osteoporosis, special needs of the elderly (particularly those in nursing homes), fiber, Recommended Daily Allowances, sugar, proper fluid intake, vitamins, lengtheningof life through diet, diet and heart disease, and shopping on low budgets. NIA has been active in disseminating information on the nutrition-related prob-lem of osteoporosis. In response to the requests for information on the treatmentand prevention of osteoporosis, the NTA prepared an Age Page entitled \"Osteoporo- sis: The Bone Thinner,\" Over one million copies of this Age Page was distributed inbulk quantities. Many small town newspapers and senior citizen organizations picked up this material and made it available to their readers. A revision of theosteoporosis Age Page reflected a more aggressive approach to the prevention andtreatment of the disease. This new publication was part of a cooperative effort be-tween the American Association of Retired Person [AARP] and the NIA. AARP hasmade this Age Page, as well as more lengthy literature on the subject, available toits extensive membership. Material on osteoporosis is also included in the 750,000copies of \"Help Yourself to Good Health,\" a joint educational effort by the Institute and Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. To coincide with the Department of Health and Human Services' strategy for im-proving and enhancing the health and well-being of older citizens, and interagency52 effort involving the NIA, the Administration on Aging, the Office of Disease Preven- tion and Health Promotion, the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA], and other agencies has led to the distribution of publication on nutrition. In 1984, DHHS also launched Healthy Older People, a two-year national public education program designed to encourage older Americans to adopt healthy life- styles that can reduce the risks of illness and help them lead more active lives. Sponsored by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of the U.S. Public Health Service, the program is providing broadcast and print materials to the States and interested national organizations on the topics of exercise, nutrition, safe use of medicines, smoking cessation, injury control, and preventive health serv- ices. The program is now in its second year of operation. Every State is now participat- ing in Healthy Older People; television public service announcements [PSA's] urging older Americans to adopt healthy habits have been distributed to all State contacts and national television networks; regional training has been conducted in ten loca- tions to encourage State and local organizations to join in Healthy Older People, and to give them skills in working with the media and creating ongoing health pro- motion programs. Approximately 500 people attended these sessions, representing State and local government agencies, voluntary organizations, universities and hos- pitals. Other crucial groups in promotion of the health of older Americans are the na- tional voluntary organizations. AARP has produced television public service an- nouncements and trained AARP health advocates on health promotion issues. The American Hospital Association is sponsoring a nationwide teleconference to inform professionals in health and social service organizations about the issue and the Na- tional Council on Aging keeps its numerous groups serving older people informed about the program. The Public Health Service is now working with several other national groups which have expressed interest in distributing Healthy Older People materials and conducting health promotion programs. In addition, a private sector support plan has been developed to request the involvement of corporations and other groups in Healthy Older People. Additional program materials for States and organizations will be completed in January, and will include radio public service announcements; television and radio news segments and producers' guides; press packets, skill sheets and posters for con- sumers, and a how-to-participate guide. Materials and programs on health promotion for older Americans are receiving increasing attention in the State and local communities. The goal now is to continue to stimulate those efforts through the provision of technical assistance via the Healthy Older People hotline, bimonthly program memos and on-site visits. Also, the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] engages in a broad array of activi- ties to foster consumer awareness of nutrition-related issues. These activities in- clude consumer education programs, surveys to determine consumer needs and in- terest, publications, news releases, coordination of conferences, active participation in national initiatives such as the Surgeon General's Report on Diet, Nutrition and Health (due to be released late in 1986), Nutrition Education Task Force, Nutrition Objectives for the Nation in 1990, and the recently published Dietary Guidelines for Americans, in addition to the Agency's regulatory responsibilities. For an overview of these activities and programs, there is attached an addendum to the testimony which provides a detailed description of FDA efforts. This concludes my prepared statement, Mr. Chairman. I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have. Our final panelist here is Wynona Town, who is going to answer questions but does not want to give an initial statement. Is that right? Ms. TOWN. Yes; I think because of the time limit. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. That is fine. Let me just ask a couple of questions of the panel and then Dr. Blumberg probably will have some questions also. Rita, could I ask you, is there any consistent State policy at the mealsites that the State oversees to try to encourage or require any kind of exercise program in connection with the providing of meals?53 Ms. MALS. There is no State policy requiring this. However, through development of our programs at the local level and with the area agencies on aging and the State agency, there is a strong effort in terms of health promotion for New Mexico coordinating this with New Mexico State University in developing some exercise programs at our senior centers. Senator BINGAMAN. But you say there are exercise programs pro- moted at the senior centers as a normal thing at the present time or not? Ms. MAEs. Yes, there is a very strong emphasis in health promo- tion in exercise among the seniors at the local level. It is not a State policy, but we do encourage it, from the State perspective, to have exercise programs at the senior centers. Senator BINGAMAN. Let me ask Sonia Crow, if I could, about this H.R. 2453 that I was urged by Rita to support. What is your posi- tion on that? MS. CROW. You are going to have to identify other than by number, Senator, or I am not going to know it. Sorry about that. Senator BINGAMAN. That is the one which would take away the Secretary of Agriculture's discretion to lower the per-meal amountthat USDA contributes. Do you have a position on that? What is the administration's po- sition on that? MS. CROW. Well, I don't know if the administration has taken a position on that specific legislation. The way the program works now is that the Secretary of Agriculture is prohibited, by law, from spending more than the amount that Congress has appropriated forthat program, which is approximately $120.8 million for this past year. Given that maximum available amount of money, then the amount and the rate of reimbursement per meal must change ac- cording to the number of people that receive meals during the course of a year, which of course is within the control of the vari- ous State and local agencies when they have people come forward to join them in the congregate feeding. We will not know, in fact, until next month how many meals have actually been served in the past fiscal year for 1985 because the Government works on a fiscal year cycle, not on a calendar year cycle. Depending on the number of meals, we will know the exact reimbursement rate that is available. That is the way the law is right now. So the Secretary, basically, has no discretion to set the rate. He has to abide within the amount of money that Congress has appropriated for the program, and we have hit that maximum ceiling. Senator BINGAMAN. As I understand the issue that is presented in Congress it is whether or not we should set a particular level for the cents-per-meal that will be provided. MS. CROW. Whether there should be just a flat cents-per-meal rate rather than a certain amount appropriated? Senator BINGAMAN. Yes. Ms. Cotow. I don't know if the administration has taken a specific position on that point. Just strictly speaking for myself, it seems to put the issue sort of backward.54 You have a certain amount of limited fiscal resources. I think we are all very well aware that we are facing a massive deficit. There is a certain amount of money that is given to this program, and then it is just a question of how many people will take advantage of the meals and how many people actually make donations toward those meals. Those meals are available to everyone. You can be the wealthiest person in town and if you want to go down and have a meal you can do that. Nobody asks you. But if you want to give a donation for it, that donation is obviously more than welcomed by the people who run those programs. So I think you have to keep that in mind. Senator BINGAMAN. Let me ask, also on the same thing, is there any effort at education in nutrition as part of the Food Stamp Pro- gram? MS. CROW. Well, I think that is a really important issue that was commented on by a number of people on the first panel: by Ms. Reynolds and others who commented on the fact that it is impor- tant to know what you are doing. If you are going to get food stamps and you are going to take them to the grocery store, you ought to know what it is that you need and how to shop smartly. Nutrition education, of course, is always an ongoing effort everywhere, at all levels of Government. But since 1984 the Department of Agriculture and my agency, in particular, have placed a special emphasis on nutrition education for consumers, particularly those within the food stamp population. We have developed an array of pamphlets that are actually in easy-to-read English. They are very useful to me personally. They are designed to remind people to read labels; they are designed to tell you what kind of food to buy-maybe generic brands, you know store brands, instead of the high-priced brands so you will make your dollars go farther and get exactly the same nutritional bang for your buck. Mr. Dickey was smart enough to bring what I think are pretty snazzy pictures that we post around just to remind people that the smart consumer is an educated consumer. These types of materials are available free, Senator, to people who are food stamp recipients to assist them, and to others who wish to receive them from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. There is just a very modest print- ing fee that you will be charged. Senator BINGAMAN. The ones that you had there as examples seemed to concentrate on how you get more for your dollar. MS. CROW. Yes. Senator BINGAMAN. Are there also educational materials that try to inform you on what foods are good for you and what foods aren't? MS. CROW. Well, within the material there is stress, for example, on eating a variety of foods. What we find out is that there are an awful lot of people in the food stamp population-which is a reflec- tion of the way all of us eat-who probably eat too much in the way of meat instead of using a variety of protein sources, such as fish and poultry, to supplement their diet rather than spending all of their money on the red meat category.55 I think people are becoming increasingly aware of the impor-tance of balance. Meat is a very important protein contributor inyour diet, but you don't want to focus on it exclusively. You wantto spread it around a little bit. These pamphlets are designed to give you that kind of consumereducation. Senator BINGAMAN. Do they give you more than just say, eat avariety? I mean, do they actually indicate you should eat more fruits, or vegetables, those types of things? Ms. CRow. Yes, they basically tell you exactly that. Right. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Did you have something? Mr. DicKEY. Yes, if I could spinoff on the point that Ms. Crowmade, in New Mexico during this past year this array of materialhas found its way into the local certification offices in all the certi-fication project areas. We are also working with the State Department of Human Serv-ices now to attempt to put together, as a part of their ongoing FoodStamp Program, a nutrition education dimension of that program,which is authorized now-has been for sometime. Not many States have taken advantage of that. It would be a 50- 50 match just like the regular administration of the Food StampProgram. This State has noted they are very interested in that andwe are pursuing that with them. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Let me ask Dr. Hadley, if I could, based on your comments aboutevidence that seniors do not get enough vitamin D and some otherof those things, we had a hearing last year on the general questionof health promotion as it affects the elderly. Some of the testimonythere was from Dr. Goodwin, who is the associate professor of med-icine and chief of the division of Gerontology at our University ofNew Mexico School of Medicine. He said based on the studies that they have been doing here hethought it was advisable for people over the age of 65 to take a one-a-day vitamin. Later in the conversation, when I was asking himabout it, I asked if that was an appropriate thing to be provided aspart of this meal program; he seemed to think it was. What is your reaction to that? Do we know enough at thepresent time about vitamin deficiencies among senior citizens thatit would be advisable to have that as a normal part of a mealsiteprogram? I would ask Dr. Blumberg the same question or any of the rest ofyou. Dr. HADLEY. If I might, I would like to break the question intotwo parts. One is on the issue of vitamin supplementation in gener- al. The widespread presence of deficiencies in the diet of olderpeople of various nutrients has led me to think that it may be pru-dent-certainly not imprudent-to take a multiple vitamin supple-ment of approximately the RDA for various nutrients. That shouldbe distinguished from megavitamin supplementation, which isrisky and not advisable.56 I think the issue of adding vitamin supplements to nutritional programs involves other things besides the nutritional require- ments. I think the Department would be glad to provide an answer, but I think that would involve the Administration on Aging and other providers; and we would be happy to provide it to you. I don't think I am personally qualified to make a comment on that. Senator BINGAMAN. Doctor, did you have a comment on that or would you rather come back to it? Dr. BLUMBERG. I think I will come back to that. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Let me just ask one other question of Wynona Town of the Indian Health Service. Part of the testimony, also, from that earlier hearing last year was to the effect that we have a great deficiency in the number of Indian people in this country who are trained as dietitians or involved in these kinds of issues. I think Larry Curley, who testified there, said that he was not aware of a single Indian person in this country who was trained or registered as a dietitian. Now, I don't know, that may be an over- statement. Perhaps you could give me your view as to the extent to which we have a major deficiency in training people in this area in our Indian community. STATEMENT OF WYNONA TOWN, SANTA FE, NM, CHIEF, NUTRITION AND DIETETICS PROGRAM, INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE Ms. TOWN. Well, basically he never has met me. [Laughter.] Senator BINGAMAN. You have never met Larry Curley? Ms. TOWN. No. Senator BINGAMAN. You need to get out and meet him. He is in Laguna Pueblo. Ms. TOWN. I am a registered dietitian and I have a masters in public health nutrition, and I am a Yakima Tribal Member from the Northwest, Washington State, and I also am Choctaw. The Chief of the Indian Health Service Nutrition Dietetics Branch is also an Indian person, has a Ph.D., and is a registered dietitian. We are working very hard on including more qualified people in Indian Health Service. We continually look for Indian people who are working on their degrees in dietetics and encourage them and promote them. The numbers are increasing all the time. The Indian Health Service works very hard to recruit Indian di- etitians and nutritionists. There are not as many as we would like to see, but we are aware of the need. The area nutritionist at the Portland area office is also an Indian person, and has a Ph.D. The two people I mentioned, I know very well. Senator BINGAMAN. We need you to get together with Larry Curley here and discuss what he thinks the deficiencies are. To what extent does the Indian Health Service, based on your ex- perience, have an outreach program to try to provide any kind of nutritional education to the Indian community that do not wind up in your hospital or some facility that IHS has? Is there an effort to57 get out in the communities and really educate people on their needs in this area? Ms. TowN. That is the primary effort of the public health nutri-tionists that are located at the service units.If I might give you some information on New Mexico. All tribesof New Mexico are served by the Albuquerque area office. Thereare some Navajo tribes that are also in New Mexico and they areserved by the Navajo area office. The area offices are regional.Within the area office regions there are local service units. New Mexico has five. The Navajo area in New Mexico has three hospi-tals, which also serve as service units. The Albuquerque area includes tribes in New Mexico and Colora- do. There are 26 tribes total; 19 of those are Pueblo. There are alsothree Navajo communities and two Apache communities, and thenthere is also a tribe of Ute people in Colorado. The people are served by the service units. In the Albuquerquearea, we are lucky enough to have dietitians and nutritionists innearly all of the service units. There are seven public health nutri-tionists, there are six dietitians. Two positions are in the process ofbeing filled. We don't have individuals in those positions at thispoint. There also is the capability to contract with nutritionists or dieti-tians to serve some programs, but this limits service somewhat be- cause, whenever you contract you may not have a full-time personthere all the time, but it is a nutrition resource. There are also some individuals who are employed by IndianHealth Service that work with tribal members. These persons are,many times, members of the tribe themselves and are called nutri-tion technicians. They are not registered dietitians, but may be rec-ognized by the American Dietetic Association and they are trainedmany times by the nutritionist. The nutrition technicians assist in doing some of the education ofpatients and clients, and do programs in the communities. The Indian Health Service is a unique organization in that we doa lot of direct service in nutrition. If I could, I would like to de-scribe some of the activities that we do. Senator BINGAMAN. Why don't you for just a minute. Then Dr.Blumberg, I am sure, has some questions, too. Ms. TOWN. OK. Senator BINGAMAN. But go ahead if you would like. Ms. TowN. In looking at the services that are provided, nutrition-ists provide services directly to patients in the hospital. Dietitiansusually counsel inpatients and see the people who come to the hos-pital as outpatients, they are not in a hospital bed, but they come to the hospital for care. A person can get counseling in that way, but also the nutrition-ists do consultation with a lot of the programs in the communities, like home health care, the title VI programs and the senior meals.The size and number of programs will vary according to thenumber of people in the community. Some service units may have 6,000 people and another serviceunit may not have that many people. So one nutritionist may beserving more people and may be more spread out. So the amount of58 attention that the elderly person gets depends on a number of other factors. But the nutrition consultation is available through the training of the Indian program staff. In the elderly Indian population, con- sidering the extended family situation, sometimes an elderly person can get nutrition information because they show up at other programs. They may be receiving commodities where a dem- onstration is going on and a nutritionist or a nutrition technician is providing information. Or they may be a daily caregiver for a WIC Program participant, a child, and may come in and receive information about the nutri- tion for that child. Now, the education may not be on nutrition for the elderly person, but many times, as you all know, if somebody is talking directly to you and telling you what is good for you, it is a lot harder to take than if they are telling you how to do good for your family and for your grandchild. There is nutrition education coming through other programs. For example, some elderly people may be home day care providers. They have a day care program in their home. They usually receive training from IHS nutritionists in the community. Also, the cooks at the senior sites receive training in food produc- tion, food principles, and menu planning. Sometimes this is provid- ed by the nutritionist or the nutrition technician. In some service units, they do training on a quarterly basis; others set up a sched- ule that works well for their community. The program that I work for is the Nutrition and Dietetics Training Program. We are a headquarters program. We also con- duct workshops on food production and accept people from tribal feeding programs. We have a week-long workshop where we train participants in meal planning and food production. They actually do cooking when in Santa Fe because that facility has a kitchen to do that. We accept people for training from senior citizens' programs, but also Headstart and other feeding programs. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Thank you. Dr. Blumberg, do you have some questions? Dr. BLUMBERG. I think I have more questions than we have time, but let me try a few. The first one I will address to Ms. Maes. You demonstrated a large unmet need for feeding programs for the elderly. How do you determine who participates in the programs that you do offer? Who gets excluded and why? Ms. M&Es. Well, Dr. Blumberg, most of the senior centers are strategically located in low-income areas, in low-income housing. So they are directed toward the low-income and minority population. However, we do not have guidelines or criteria for income eligi- bility for a program. Anyone can come into a senior center and participate, but because of the location of the senior centers they are geared toward more of the low-income minority individuals. Dr. BLUMBERG. Ms. Crow, you mentioned the NSDA's effort on the Food Stamp Program through the Social Security Administra- tion, to provide information on food stamps and nutrition. Especial- ly in light of what the previous consumer panel indicated, that the congregate meal settings are really where they learn about most of59 the social service programs and nutrition information and educa-tion. Do you have some information that the Social Security Adminis-tration is doing an adequate job and is the right place to dissemi-nate this kind of information to the elderly? Ms. CROW. Well, it is certainly one convenient place. Really, a lotof people who are receiving SSI payment, supplemental payments,are also on the Food Stamp Program. So there is an obvious linkbetween the two and it serves a useful function for them.They only have to go to one place instead of two places, and thatmakes an important difference for people who have particulartransportation needs. It is not always easy for an elderly person togo to an office and wait in a line, and this cuts out half the wait.I think that is a very important contribution toward making lifea little bit easier for this important segment of the population.Perhaps I am really not the best one to answer the rest of yourquestion. There are a variety of places where people can receive in-formation about food stamps and not only food stamps, but theother programs that are available whether it is at the State levelor the local level or they are federally administered. I think people pretty well know, certainly, that the Food StampProgram is available to them. Dr. BLUMBERG. Thank you. I have one other question.I certainly am one that appreciates the wide scope of nutritionprograms and nutrition research that the USDA conducts fromyoung children and pregnant women all the way to the elderly.I was wondering if you are aware of the agency's position that, inlight of Gramm-Rudman and related deficit-reduction programs,how the agency is viewing the proportion of their effort that shouldgo to nutrition research and nutrition programs oriented to thegroup we are interested in here today-namely, the elderly-whenthey have to make decisions about all of nutrition research? Ms. CRow. I wish I could answer that question. I am not a part ofthe agency, the ARS, that is responsible for the fundamental nutri-tional research that is conducted by the USDA. I was basicallyserving as a conduit for their information so that you could have ittoday. I really don't know how they function. As far as Gramm-Rudman, which is the legislation we have allbeen hearing about-and I know the Senator has been very active-ly involved in that-having to do with deficit reductions, there hasbeen a very strong feeling as far as feeding programs go and foodstamps that those are exempted categories and that benefits wouldnot be taken away from them if Gramm-Rudman were applied.Dr. BLUMBERG. Thank you. I had two questions for you, Dr. Hadley. One is that I think cer-tainly anybody in the aging research area knows that the NationalInstitute on Aging is the premier research institution and has pro-duced some of the most exciting results in this area.But when we talk about nutrition it seems that we have both theUSDA and the NIH involved in what seems very much to be over-lapping programs. Are you aware of any coordinating effort be-tween the agencies so that programs are not duplicated or at leastare coordinated in their efforts?60 Dr. HADLEY. I believe there is some coordination between the Na- tional Institute on Aging and the Tufts Center. Our scientific direc- tor has a regular liaison with the Tufts Center. Beyond that I am not aware of any other coordination between NIA and USDA. I may not be the best person to answer that. Dr. BLUMBERG. I guess I am aware of the ones with Tufts and the Gerontology Research Center. Dr. HADLEY. Right. Dr. BLUMBERG. We are concerned more about at higher levels. Dr. HADLEY. Right. I am not aware of any liaison there. There is a general liaison, between NIH and the USDA through the Nutri- tion Coordinating Committee, but that is not specific to our Insti- tute alone. We are part of that Nutrition Coordinating Committee so, in that sense, there is liaison. Dr. BLUMBERG. Thank you. I have one other question, at least. In your submitted testimony you indicated that NIA and the Na- tional Academy of Sciences are planning to evaluate and improve the RDA's for the elderly. Can you tell me where you are in that process? Dr. HADLEY. Yes; we have had a series of meetings with the food and nutrition board staff. These started about a year ago. The original plan was to organize a conference and then a series of posi- tion papers on research needs for evaluating RDA's for the elderly. Since then, as you know, the timetable for RDA's has been post- poned by the National Academy of Sciences. It was planning to issue new RDA's this fall, but this has been postponed. As a matter of fact, as you may recall one of the reasons it gave for not issuing RDA's at this time was the need to look more close- ly at nutritional needs of the elderly. Since the change in the schedule we have not had any formal meetings with them, but we are still planning to go ahead with this collaboration. Dr. BLUMBERG. Can you tell me, are you aware of what the NIH's position is on what the viewpoint or the definition or the perspective should be on what RDA's for the elderly ought to be? Dr. HADLEY. I don't think there is an Institute position. I can give you my personal one. I think it is shared by many of my col- leagues. It is that RDA's need to be evaluated with regard to health of the aged throughout the life span. It is important to look at RDA's for older people in terms of their specific nutritional needs, changes in absorption and so forth. It is also important to look at recommended dietary allowances for younger ages as well with an eye to setting them at the best level to prevent disease in later life. One example would be calci- um. That is, the intake of calcium early in life may have a great impact on how much osteoporosis appears later in life. One should take old age into consideration when thinking about recommended intakes for younger people as well. If you could spare me about half a minute, I want to followup a bit on your question about dietary supplements. It is important not to forget that the best way to try to assure a nutritionally adequate diet is to try to get the nutrients into the diet itself. That is important for both well-understood nutrients and for die- tary components whose nutriental role we don't fully understand61 yet and are not included in multiple vitamin supplements but which may be very important. Also, many nutrients may be ab- sorbed better when taken in foods than in supplementary forms. To assure adequate nutrition, the first step is to try to get the nutrients in the normal diet and have a nutritionally balanced diet and then, if that is not adequate, to consider supplementation. Ms. TOWN. Can I answer that? It is my personal opinion that it is not a good idea to blanket supplement people. This relates to Dr. Blumberg's statement about the fact that many elderly people fall prey to encouragement to take megadoses of vitamins. Passing out vitamins allows. people to not take responsibility for their own nutritional intake. Granted, if a person cannot afford certain foods, he/she has a certain need; but, the supplements don't give you any protein or any calories. So they cannot substitute for food. It is not a good idea to serve supplements to everyone because the insinuation isthat supplements are food and they are good for you. A person is only recommended to take vitamins if under stress or if they have a special need for a supplement, in addition to normalnutritional intake. So blanket supplementing really is not the rec- ommended method of choice. Dr. HADLEY. I agree. On the one hand I feel it may be prudent for many elderly to take a minimal nutrient supplement. But, on the other hand, I have great concerns about what that could imply to the individual-that somehow through taking pills and tablets you will answer all of your problems. This could lead to megados- ing as well. Ms. TOWN. It is important to know where a person is first before you make any recommendations about what they should do. Senator BINGAMAN. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the panel bearing with us. We thank you all for being here. We may have some additional questions in writing to submit to you after the hearing is concluded and we will include the answer in the hearing record. Senator BINGAMAN. Why don't we go ahead and get the third panel up here: Dr. Thompson, Kathryn Treat, and Stephanie Fall- creek. I gather Dr. Thompson has another engagement and needs to leave very shortly. So why don't we go ahead and get started with you, if you would, please. We appreciate you. being here. As I understand, your position is assistant professor in the Department of Family, Community and Emergency Medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine here in Albuquerque, and director of the Geriatric Pro- grams for the Medical School. We appreciate you being here. 62-178 0 -86 -362 STATEMENT OF ROBERT THOMPSON, M.D., ALBUQUERQUE, NM, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY, COMMUNI- TY AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Dr. THOMPSON. Thank you very much for inviting me. I would like to emphasize at the start that I am not an expert in nutrition. I am a clinical physician. I have been at the medical school for 3 years. It was during this last 3 years as director of the geriatric activi- ties in family medicine that I have become increasingly aware of and concerned about the issue of nutrition in our patients, and that certainly is an extremely common problem. I think I should also emphasize that my primary experience is with patients-that is, rather frail people-commonly with a number of health problems, not the kind of people who usually come to hearings like this or even commonly go to the senior activ- ity programs that have been referred to to date. I had no training in medical school in nutrition so my views have come about primarily through years of working with patients and, really, learning through the contact with patients to focus on this as a significant issue. One of the things that I had been primarily interested in-actu- ally before I got to the medical school, but this has further devel- oped since-and I have developed at least some expertise in is the issue of physical activity for older people. I have a little research project that I just want to briefly mention to you. I work with a physical educator and an exercise physiologist to exercise impaired elderly people, people with common health prob- lems and functional limitations, people ages 65 to 85. The purpose is to see if these people will functionally improve if they participate in a carefully designed exercise program. As you folks may know, there is a great deal of information pointing out that older people also will benefit from physical activi- ty programs, but most of the information that is available pertains to well older people. As a matter of fact, most of these studies have excluded people with common health problems. Well, we have been looking at those kinds of people-people who have diagnoses, take common medications-and we have enrolled them in exercise classes. As a matter of fact, that is what I am anx- ious to get out for-because we have invited out to our house, at 2 p.m., 80 of these participants over the last couple of years and I am anticipating that there is going to be 40 or 50 of these people arriv- ing at my home at about 2 this afternoon. So I am going to have to move on. Senator BINGAMAN. If you will give us the address, we will all come. [Laughter.] Dr. THOMPSON. I want to just briefly explain what goes on in our geriatric evaluation clinic. This is an outpatient clinic aimed at the common and usually complicated health problems that face older people. It occurs as the Family Practice Center at the medical school and it now is a part of the geriatric training for physicians in internal medicine and family practice.63 As I have emphasized, most of those patients in that clinic are, indeed, rather frail people. We tend to see, for example, that de- pression is probably a significant part of the life of at least close to all, if not all, of these patients, and nutritional concerns as they interact with the common health problems that we see, again, is almost always something that we really need to seriously look at. We do not have a nutritionist working with us, unfortunately. Asan example of something that we do have, we have a very good social worker that works with us in that clinic. As a matter of fact, the funding for that position is due to expire this June. So these are examples of the kinds of constraints that we work with in the clinic setting. We have, at times in our geriatric clinic, had on loan to us a nu-tritionist from a research program-as a matter of fact, the re- search program that Senator Bingaman had referred to earlierthat had been started several years ago by Dr. Goodwin here at the university. Well, his nutritionist has, at times, come over and worked with us kind of on a loan basis. But, from a practical standpoint we really do not have such services available to us. There is, I am pleased to say, a lot more interest and emphasis on nutritional aspects of patient care in the medical school setting, but most of that emphasis, I think, takes place in the acute-care hospital rather than in outpatient clinics like our own. Now, just to emphasize three or four specific things that I think we are increasingly aware of and have to pay attention to in our clinic setting. One is that I think we physicians are commonly not very aware of how the medications we give patients may affect the nutritional status. I am not thinking so much about interaction with the medica- tions as what it may do to the appetite itself. I find that we need to constantly pay attention to the fact that virtually every single medication, including all over-the-counter medications, may de- crease the appetite or provoke some kind of intestinal upset which will also add to the person's tendency to eat less. So by being most therapeutic we risk being counterproductive re- garding the nutritional status. A second thing that is very, very frustrating for us to deal with are some of the behaviors that have been ingrained over long peri- ods of time. For example, taste preferences tend to increase with age and it becomes increasingly difficult for a person who is accus- tomed to salting their foods or having a fair amount of sweetness flavoring in their food. Those tastes don't work as well, so the tendency is if we are now salting or eating highly sweetened foods-as a couple of exam-ples-we will tend to do so. Further, we will do more of that as we age. I like to think of myself in that context because I certainly like ice cream and the risk is I am going to like ice cream even more as I get older. [Laughter.] Dr. THOMPSON. Another thing that commonly happens is that we become increasingly fussy as we age. So if there are somethingsthat perhaps we have been eating because we think we should64 when we are younger, I think we are going to tend to be more re- luctant to do that as we age. Another very difficult problem, I think, is the issue of using packaged foods. Most of the people who are elderly now did not grow up using packaged foods and I kind of wonder what is going to happen to people of my generation or further back down the road-those of us who are so dependent on packaged foods. That certainly risks compromising nutritional status as we tend to do this more and more later on in life. Now, physical activity has been alluded to by two or three people. I think that is, indeed, a key thing. The person who is not physically active-our clinic population, for example-most times is doing rather poorly as far as physical activity is concerned. It is difficult to expect them to, therefore, eat very much if they cannot do something about their pattern of physical activity. Another very important thing, I think, are family interactions. When Faith Roessel of your office called me a couple of weeks ago, I had in the previous 3 or 4 days had two very difficult interactions in the geriatric clinic with patients and their families where basi- cally the primary or at least some very important concerns of both these families were how the older person, the patient, was eating. The way that they were dealing with that is, in my interpreta- tion, to badger that older person. They were, then, provoking-at least in one of the patients it seemed very clear-more resistance as a result of her interaction with her daughter to good nutrition. Her daughter was demanding that she eat well and the patient's reaction was, \"I will be darned if I will. I am going to eat what I want to eat.\" So, the tactics in dealing with the elderly person's reluctance to eat the way we think that they should may be a very important part. It seems to me that we could use more help in the clinical setting and perhaps, it occurs to me, out in the nutrition centers to look at the advice of family therapists or perhaps psychologists in helping us figure out ways to improve motivation in our elderly population. Again, let me emphasize that my particular experience is dealing with people who have a wide variety of health concerns and prob- lems. I think I will stop at this point. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Thank you very much. Doctor, did you have a question? Dr. BLUMBERG. Well, I guess one obvious one is: Do you find a significant improvement in the kinds of services you were able to offer when ou did have the nutritionist present in the clinic? Did you fnd that to be a real boost or did you not see a big dif- ference? Dr. THOMPSON. We did not really have any way of looking at that carefully. We all felt better about having that person there to talk with patients. If I talk about nutrition with a patient and/or their family, my feeling is they get a certain amount of information and expertise. If I have a dietitian do that, my hunch is that not only is the infor- mation better, but that person is probably going to do a better job of talking about that to the patient than I will.65 Dr. BLUMBERG. Even in the absence of a nutritionist, do you usu- ally include nutrition-related questions to the subjects? Like, do they have a kitchen or do they do their own shopping or cooking, those kinds of questions? Dr. THOMPSON. Indeed. Like in most geriatric training facilities nowadays, we have an overall assessment questionnaire. One part of that-in addition to dealing with things like the emotional status, the cognitive or mental function of the person, their ability to do their own daily care things like that-is we also focus on nu- trition. The specific questions that we ask are rather lengthy and, of course, there are about five or six. They are things like: Who fixes your meals for you? How many regular meals do you eat a day? Rather common questions; but we probably only skim off the sur- face by doing it this way. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Thank you. We will allow you to go pre- pare for your many guests. We appreciate your being here very much. Dr. THOMPSON. Thank you; and I thank you for inviting me. [The prepared statement of Dr. Thompson follows:] PREPARED SrATEMENT OF ROBERT F. THoMpsoN, M.D. I am Director of the geriatric programs in the Department of Family, Community and Emergency Medicine here at the School of Medicine, in New Mexico. This in- cludes the Geriatric Evaluation Clinic, and out-patient clinic for the elderly, which I will subsequently describe in more detail. I am far from an expert in nutrition, had no training in the nutrition during my medical education, and have only begun in the past ten years with my clinical experience to appreciate the importance of nu-trition in the management of patients, especially the elderly. I have worked as a physician for twenty-five years, the past ten years focusing specifically on elderly patients. I have been a full-time faculty member at the School of Medicine for the past three years. During this time, I have developed a research project regarding physical activity for impaired elderly patients. Briefly, I work with a physical educa- tor and exercise physiologist to exercise impaired elderly people, ages 65 to 85, to see if they will functionally improve when they participate in a carefully designed class of exercises. Though there is a great deal of information about the benefits from exercise for older people who are well, those with common medical diagnoses and physical restrictions are commonly excluded from exercise programs. We have been interested in demonstrating that even typical elderly patients have a great deal to gain from enrolling in carefully structured exercise classes. I wish to cover the following material: (1) I will describe our Geriatric Evaluation Clinic. (2) I will briefly present some information from a survey of patients in that clinic, done during 1983 and 1984. (3) I will emphasize the most common concerns of the clinician physicians in that setting. (4) I will briefly comment on exposure of physicians in training to nutritional concerns and information. (5) I will present my specific concerns regarding some of the behavioral influences on nutrition for the elderly. (6) I will summarize, and suggest some specific recommendations. The Geriatric Evaluation Clinic was started in 1982 at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. It is currently sponsored by both Family Medicine andInternal Medicine. It takes place two half days per week, and usually there is one Internal Medicine faculty physician, one Family Practice faculty physician, one In-ternal Medicine resident, one or perhaps two Family Practice residents, and an oc- casional medical student. These providers see 10-15 patients each clinic afternoon, with the faculty physicians seeing a few patients but having the primary responsi- bility to supervise the residents, reviewing patients in detail. The last hour of each afternoon is set aside for group discussion of the clinical problems encountered. This exposes the training physician to not only physical status and diseases, but also to issues regarding mental function, emotional state, social resources, economic con- cerns, and, of course, nutritional issues. Questions regarding nutritional status in- clude how many prepared meals does the patients eat each day, who fixes these66 meals, types of foods eaten, who buys the food, and are supplements such as vita-mins and calcium used. In this clinical setting, a gerontological nurse specialist did a survey, covering ap-proximately nine months, during 1983 and 1984. A portion of this survey was direct-ed to the concerns regarding nutrition of the patient or their caretaker. This infor-mation yet to be published, repetitively showed the following concerns: transportionwas a problem, both to get to meals and to get to the grocery store to purchase food;our patients commonly needed help, other than transportation, to do their shopping;financial restrictions often led them to restrict their purchases of such things asmeat; and dairy products were often reduced due to difficulty digesting milk prod-ucts and to attempts to reduce chlesterol intake. We, the clinicians in the Geriatric Clinic, have become increasingly aware of thefollowing as we see patients: 1. Decrease in appetite is extremely common amongst our patients. We as physi-cians are commonly not aware of the effect of drugs on food intake, either by de-creasing appetite or by provoking intestinal upset. Every single drug taken by anelderly person risks decreasing their food intake.2. Our elderly patients are frequently depressed, frustrated and therefore less in-terested in nutrition and many other important aspects of general health care.Family interactions may aggrevate this, with the patient being badgered to eatbetter. Such may discourage them even further, or stir up even more resistance.3. Those who live alone frequently comment, \"It's not worth it to fix a meal forjust myself\". A study done in the East illustrating this point was briefly presentedat a January 1985 meeting in San Antonio, of the Society of Teachers of FamilyMedicine. This particular study showed that those who ate alone had the poorestfood intake; those who had someone else fix their meal ate somewhat better; butthose who went out to eat with others had the best food intake nutritionally.4. Though difficulty eating, due to dental problems or changes in esophagus move-ments, are widely talked about, we have not found very often in our clinic thatthese are difficulties which patients or their family members acknowledge. Though the clinical setting is the most effective and most practical place to teachsuch as things as nutritional awareness, this is infrequently done in medical train-ing. All hospitals nowadays have dieticians included amongst their staffs. Their con-tact with physicians may be minimal and confined to situations where nutritionalconcerns are very obvious. Out-patient clinical training commonly does not includethe participation of a dietician. Though we have at time, in our Geriatric Evalua-tion Clinic, been able to \"borrow\" a nutritionist from a research program, from apractical standpoint, this service is not available to us or our patients. We can sendour patients over to University Hospital, for consultation with a dietician; this how-ever entails a short automobile drive, followed by a short walk and elevator ride. Inaddition, the dietician may be unavailable, due to responsibilities in the hospital.This means that we lose both the opportunity to improve our service and to focusmore awareness on nutrition, in the training setting.I would like to now briefly emphasize some of my personal concerns. Patient man-agement in the geriatric population commonly involves complex interactions andissues. For the most fragile patients, nutrition is almost always a significant con-cern. Overall strength, immune function, mental function, and disease managementare commonly impaired, at least in part, due to inability to maintain nutrition.Dealing with nutritional issues in the clinical setting is often complicated by pat-terns of behavior learned earlier in life. Thus, dietary habits tend to become morepronounced with age. Taste sensitivity declines, so it takes more of such things assalt and sugar to provoke pleasure and stimulate appetite. We tend to become morefussy as we age, thus more selective of what foods we will use. Those who beforehave relied mainly on foods easy to prepare, or prepackaged, will tend to do moreso as time progresses. Especially with those elderly people with health problems,physical activity declines, thus further inhibiting appetite. In summarizing, I will make a few recommendations. My comments are those of aphysician-clinician, and I hope will serve to reinforce the concerns of those who rep-resent other viewpoints, and who are perhaps providing services to the elderly.1. We should continue to focus in a preventive fashion, that is, develop good nutri-tional habits early in life, so that we can expect to carry over to later life.2. Training of physicians and other care providers should be encouraged more intraining centers. The best area to teach the practical aspects of patient care is inthe clinical setting. We cannot expect to support financially such services throughbilling alone. Educational programs regarding such things as nutrition need outsidefinancial support.67 3. Meals are currently being provided to the elderly, with some attention given tothe social and educational aspects of such services. Such attempts should be further supported and enhanced, with special attention being given to those elderly whose social skills are most restricted, that is the shy and habitually alone. 4. A personal bias or concern of mine is that of the interactional aspects of nutri- tion in the elderly. It seems to me advisable that we attempt to utilize resources such as psychologist and family therapist, as we deal with situations in which the most important feature may be the motivation of the patient. Senator BINGAMAN. Our next witness is Dr. Kathryn Treat who is from Las Cruces. Dr. Treat is the assistant director of home eco- nomics for the New Mexico Cooperative Extension Service at New Mexico State University at Las Cruces. We appreciate you being here. STATEMENT OF KATHRYN TREAT, PH.D., LAS CRUCES, NM, AS- SISTANT DIRECTOR, HOME ECONOMICS, NEW MEXICO COOP- ERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE, NEW MEXICO STATE UINIVERSI- TY Dr. TREAT. Thank you very much. I would like to briefly speak to two points. One is an organization, an educational organization that is in place that can address some of the food, nutrition and health prob- Fems of the elderly; then some examples of programs that have been conducted in New Mexico this last year; and then, finally, some recommendations. In New Mexico the Cooperative Extension Service program has three major program areas. One is agriculture and resource devel- opment; the second one, home economics, which I am responsible for; and 4-H and youth development. Our extension personnel work with the people of New Mexico from at least one office location in each county. So it is accessible to the people of the State of New Mexico. Extension faculty inform people of the current research information, interpret and demon- strate its application to the immediate situation involved, and through effective teaching methods encourage the application of such research in resolving problems. The involvement of people is stressed in both planning and con- ducting these informal educational programs. County extension faculty are supported by the resources of a land grant university and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At New Mexico State University, the support includes subject matter specialists, nutritionists, agricultural experiment station research- ers, and resident teaching staff. I think this is one of the unique pieces of the Cooperation Exten- sion Service: Its research base from the land grant institution, the information the educational programs are based upon. I think that is very important as we disseminate information to people. Some examples of thrusts in food, nutrition and health in pro- grams in the counties and State this last year including over half ofour counties in the State, had programs that focused on the quality of health, longevity, and safety, and reached more than 2,500 indi- viduals through the teaching efforts of professional home econo- mists and 264 trained volunteers. We also have been active in cosponsoring multiagency healthfairs and, in some instances, these have been specifically senior cit-68 izen health fairs. I think health fairs facilitate identification ofagencies and service for the elderly, and provide inexpensive screening measures that can lead to referral to physicians. Use of microcomputer technology in Cooperative Extension Serv- ice offices also facilitates services to seniors. All county extensionhome economists have been trained in and have available a com- puterized nutrition analysis program that can be used on a one-to-one basis with seniors and provide recommendations for improvingnutrition. This program has also been utilized to analyze menus at seniornutrition sites and provide recommendations for improvement.Other county program examples include training senior compan- ion volunteers on nutrition and health for the elderly; programs atcommunity senior centers on topics such as \"Keep Moving to StayHealthy\"; special newsletters on health; features in regular countynewspapers on diet and health and fitness; and using professionalnutritionists for public programs on topics such as osteoporosis. The New Mexico Extension Service has also cooperated with theInstitute of Gerontological Research and Education at New MexicoState University to provide training for agency personnel andfamily caregivers. The extension service has a mandate to serve all people with\"practical and useful information in agriculture, home economics, and closely related areas.\" The elderly are a part of that popula-tion being served. However, without additional resources, the ability to provide in-tensified efforts is limited. County advisory committees and exten-sion service faculty recognize the needs of the elderly; and, inmany instances, the most effective efforts come about through link-ages with other agencies and groups to provide direct services oreducation. Not only in New Mexico, but nationally the well being of elderswould be enhanced by the following recommendations that I had prepared beforehand. It is interesting to hear the comments thismorning because I think some of them have been reiterated by thepanel members. No. 1, increase support of human nutrition research, particularlyin the area of diet/disease relationships, nutrient interactions, and changing needs throughout the life cycle. No. 2, centers of excellence to maximize extension education in food and nutrition through training for field staff, intensive up-dates, symposia, and workshops for multidisciplinary professionalsincluding health professionals, industry, government agencies, and also to serve as a dissemination center for research findings. No. 3, training grants to improve the expertise of extension fieldfaculty in gerontology. Gerontology is really a new discipline formany of our extension faculty. They are not prepared, educational- ly, to deal with that. No. 4, training grants to increase the skills of health service pro-viders and family members to provide support systems needed fornoninstitutional living for the elderly. No. 5, development of a paraprofessional program that wouldtarget elderly in small groups for nutrition and health education.This could be modeled after the current food and nutrition educa-69 tion program conducted by the extension service that provide nu-trition education for low-income young families. Finally, increased networking of both public and private agencies to maximize the effect of educational programs that address the needs of elders. Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. [The prepared Statement of Dr. Treat follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF KATHRYN R. TREAT, PH.D. NEW MEXICO COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE PROGRAMING TO MEET THE FOOD, NUTRITION AND HEALTH NEEDS OF OLDER PERSONS The elderly are the fastest growing age group in New Mexico. Between 1970 and 1980 there was a 64 percent increase in the number of persons 65 years or older,and New Mexico's over-75 population is growing at twice the national rate. Howev-er, lifespans of resident-born males or females have not increased in New Mexico asin the general U.S. population, partly because of historically higher accident rates,lower family income and education. Distance has limited early entry and timelyaccess to health care. In-migration of retirees from snow to sunbelt has compounded problems of access to affordable health care. HEALTH AND NUTRITION Health and nutrition have undergone dramatic changes since the early 1900's Consumer questions and current media topics alike focus on food, fitness and pre-vention of degenerative diseases. The leading causes of death are coronary heart dis- ease, cancer and stroke. In addition, many in our population suffer from arthritis,osteoporosis, diabetes and chronic liver disease. The nutritional contribution to pre-vention and treatment of these diseases is an area of active research and linkageshave been made with diets in numerous studies. Obesity is also a major problem in the United States and is a known risk factor for heart disease, hypertension, cancer and diabetes. When caloric intake is loweredto achieve weight reduction or diets are modified because of concerns about cancer,heart disease or stroke, nutrition education is especially important. Without goodplanning, low-calorie diets become nutritionally unbalanced and nutrient deficien- cies can occur. The elderly are particularly at risk since they have lower food intake but essen-tially the same nutrient requirements as younger adults. In this rapidly changing setting, nutrition information is sought and needed. Yetconflicting information abounds, and advertising strategies often confuse the con-sumer. Consumers who fail to distinguish fads, frauds, and fallacies from reliableinformation often fall into one-sided diet regiments, self-prescribed megadoses ofsupplements, quick weight-loss plans and spurious cures. Gigantic industries have been formed to sell health products to the Americanpublic. The House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging has described the $10 billion industry which promotes the sale of remedies promising relief fromchronic health conditions and has as its target the elderly. Population trends indicate that the number of small, one- and two-person house- holds will continue to rise, and that the particular needs and concerns of olderpeople will become a more important influence in food product design, retailing andmarketing, and that age-related food preferences and consumption patterns may sig-nificantly affect the U.S. food system. COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ORGANIZATION In New Mexico, the Cooperative Extension program has three major programareas of emphasis: (1) agriculture and resource development, (2) home economics,and (3) 4-H and youth development. Extension personnel work with the people ofNew Mexico from at least one office location in each county. Extension faculty inform people of the current research information, interpretand demonstrate its application to the immediate situations involved, and througheffective teaching methods encourage the application of such research in resolvingproblems. The involvement of people is stressed in both planning and conductingthese informal educational programs.70 County Extension faculty are supported by the resources of the land-grant univer- sity and USDA. At New Mexico State University this support includes subject-matter specialists, Agricultural Experiment Station researchers, and resident teach- ing staff. COOPERATIVE EXTENSION RESPONSE Lifestyle consequences is an area of Cooperative Extension Service programing that has been targeted to all population groups, however, examples of special efforts to reach older persons follow. In 1984-85 programs designed to increase the quality of health, longevity and safety were conducted in one-half of the state's counties, and reached more than 2,500 individuals through the teaching efforts of professional home economists and 264 trained volunteers in 25 program events. Five counties reported multi-agency Health Fairs, one of which was specifically a \"Senior Citizen Health Fair\". Health Fairs facilitate identification of agencies and services for the elderly and provide inexpensive screening measures that can lead to referral to physicians. Health screening procedures included height/weight relation- ships, blood pressure, hearing tests, vision tests, glaucoma check, and dental exams. Blood samples were taken for tests to determine risks for diabetes, anemia, high levels of cholesterol, blood sugar and triglicerides. Use of micro-computer technology in Cooperative Extension Service offices also fa- cilitates services to seniors. All County Extension Home Economists have beentrained in and have available a computerized nutrition analysis program that can be used on a one-to-one basis with seniors and provide recommendations for improv- ing nutrition. This program has also been utilized to analyze menus at Senior Nutri- tion Sites and provide recommendations for improvement. One county used a com- puterized \"Lifestyle Awareness\" program and provided all program participants with an analysis of habits in key areas such as eating, exercise, and stress manage- ment, and recommended ways to improve longevity. Other county program examples include training Senior Companion Volunteers on nutrition and health for the elderly, programs at community Senior Centers on topics such as \"Keep Moving to Stay Healthy\", special newletters on health, fea- tures in regular county newsletters on diet, health and fitness, and using profession- al nutritionists for public programs on topics such as osteoporosis. The New Mexico Cooperative Extension Service has also cooperated with the In-stitute for Gerontological Research and Education at New Mexico State University to provide training for agency personnel and family care-givers. In 1984-85 there were 12 pilot workshops in the state which laid the framework for an expanded project this year. Project objectives include developing a continuing education model and presenting it statewide for family caregivers and service providers. Evaluations from the pilot workshops indicated some of the most preferred topics included iden- tification of community resources, nutrition, stress management, medication man-agement, and intergenerational communication skills. RECOMMENDATIONS The Cooperative Extension Service has a mandate to serve all people with \"practi- cal and useful information in agriculture, home economics and closely related areas\". The elderly are a part of that population being served, however without ad-ditional resources, the ability to provide intensified efforts is limited. County Advisory Committees and Extension Service faculty recognize the needs of the elderly, and in many instances the most effective efforts come about through linkages with other agencies and/or groups to provide direct services or education. Not only in New Mexico, but nationally, the well-being of elders would be en- hanced through: 1. Increased support of human nutrition research, particularly in the areas of diet-disease relationships, nutrient interactions and changing nutrient needs throughout the life cycle. 2. Centers of excellence to maximize Extension education in food and nutrition through training for field staff, intensive updates, symposia and workshops for multi-disciplinary professionals including health and agriculture professionals, in-dustry representatives and government agencies, and serve as a dissemination center for research findings. 3. Training grants to improve the expertise of Extension field faculty in gerontolo- gy. Several gerontological centers and land-grant universities offer summer short- courses in gerontology that could be attended by field faculty.71 4. Training grants to increase the skills of health service providers and famil members to provide support systems needed for non-institutional living for the elderly. 5. Development of a paraprofessional program that would target elders in smallgroups with nutrition and health education. This could be modeled after the current Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program that provides nutrition educationfor low-income, young families. 6. Increased networking of both public and private agencies to maximize the effectof educational programs that address the needs of elders. Senator BINGAMAN. I think before we ask any questions, why don't we go right to Stephanie Fallcreek. Dr. Fallcreek is in charge of the Institute on Gerontological Research at New Mexico State. I have a long extensive explanation of all your great qualifications, but I misplaced it. We appreciate you being here. I appreciate your having testified at the hearing we had a little over a year ago. I am pleased to have you here again today. STATEMENT OF STEPHANIE FALLCREEK, D.S.W., DIRECTOR, THE INSTITUTE FOR GERONTOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND EDUCA- TION, NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY, LAS CRUCES, NM Dr. FALLWREEK. I want to thank you Senator Bingaman, the members of the special committee, its staff, and the audience for giving me this opportunity to discuss this very critical issue. I also would like to say that I particularly appreciate your lead- ership, Senator, in the area of health promotion. Nutrition is cer- tainly an integral component of that larger health promotion pic-ture. Well, there's good news and bad news about being the last speak- er. Most of the good news actually has already been given in earli- er testimony. We have heard a lot about how wonderful some as- pects of our Federal nutrition programs are; and that is true. It is avaluable program. It feeds many people. In the State of New Mexico, as Rita has indicated, it perhaps feeds as much as 10 per- cent of older residents of the State. I think, at this point through, my role is to share some \"bad news.\" First, given the abbreviated time available, I will confine my remarks to nutrition and aging in relation to title III programs, although there are many other important related topics which need attention. It also doesn't feed a lot of elders who need nutritional services too. Increasing the funds in order to provide more meals is really the only way to address that particular deficit. I am most concerned at this point however, with some other problems in the program. Clearly, we need more research in the area of nutrition and its relationship to health and aging. However, in the interim between the time in which that research is conducted and the results come in we will continue to provide thousands and thousands of nutri- tional meals. We have, I think, to strike a balance between the best clinical experience of nutritionists and service providers, the available re- search evidence that we do have, and practical common sense guidelines in order to make our Federal nutrition program as opti- mally healthy as possible.72 Unfortunately, an analogy comes to mind about what we did withmilitary personnel some years ago. We provided them with ciga-rettes as reward and a reinforcement. All the evidence was not yet inabout the damages and the dangers. The troops liked the cigarettesand they complained if they did not get them. We have, I think unfortunately, taken somewhat that same tackin some aspects of our Federal nutrition programs. The \"troops\"like high sugars, salty foods, and high fats; and we continue to givethem what they like, despite mounting evidence of increasedhealth risks. Now, I am not advocating that we eliminate choice for people inour Federal nutrition programs. What I am advocating is that weoffer choice, and that at least some of those choices be optimallyhealthy ones. I have been in, visited, evaluated, and reviewed the menus insenior nutrition programs around this State and in other States. Intoo many sites, salt is added excessively and there are no alterna-tives to salt as a seasoning at the table or in the kitchen.Sugar may be added to the tea automatically, rather than as anoption. There are not fresh fruit alternatives to highly sugared des-serts. Let me emphasize that I am not saying, don't offer people foods that they may have a lifetime habit of eating. I am sayingthat we need to make sure that we offer them other possibilities. As one example, look at the calcium deficit that a majority ofolder persons, especially older women have.There are many sites in this country that do not offer an alterna-tive to whole milk. I think, that when we don't offer lowfat milk ornonfat milk, or lowfat cheeses what we are doing to that large per-centage of older persons who are concerned with obesity-andrightly so-is eliminating a very good source of increased calcium.Even when lowfat milk is available, we too often have not informedparticipants of the benefits of a lowfat choice.What are the reasons for this? What are the reasons for theseand similar deficiencies in our Federal nutrition programs?First of all, I think we suffer from a lack of consensus among nu-tritionists, dietitians, and researchers. Nutrition is a very contro-versial area. The evidence is not all in, and opinions, even expertopinion on nutritional issues differ widely. For example, on thisRDA issue they were very close to issuing a whole new statementand guideline when Federal representatives said, \"Whoa. Wait aminute. We cannot come to an agreement on this particular issue. We have to go back and do more research.\"It is no wonder that our cooks and our menu planners at thelocal level feel somewhat lost about what to do when the experts,themselves, cannot even make suggestions about what a recom-mended daily allowance is in particular-nutrients for older adults.Second, there is a lack of readily available menus and recipesthat address group meal preparation in an optimally healthy way. Often locally, sites continue to use the same kinds of recipes andmenus that have been in use for years rather than integratingstate-of-the-art information, the best information that we currentlyhave, into mass feeding menus and recipes. Third, there is a distinct lack of funding for nutritionists at theState level, at the planning and service level, and at the local level.73 There is a lack of awareness among site managers, cooks and other providers of healthy nutrition principles. It is not that they might not apply them if they knew them; it is that they don't know them in many cases. Fourth, there is a lack of experience among major food suppliers in many States-and New Mexico is quite possibly an example of that-with optimally healthy nutritional ingredients. For example, using ground turkey in some circumstances to cook their food that might be lower in fat. They simply have not had any experience doing that. Some work needs to be done there and incentives to stock and sell healthier foods are needed. There is resistance, or perhaps I should say there is a lot of an- ticipated resistance, to changes in menus among older persons. What I hear from service providers, time and again is they don't want to change, \"They will not eat it if we change.\" That serves as a barrier to trying things out: again, offering people healthier choices. Another problem relates to the lack of adequate nutrition educa- tion at mealsites. Now, I know we have heard that we are doing it. The USDA does it; the nutrition sites do it; the university does it. But what mostly is done is to have some experts who come in, who speak the language that they speak in their normal professional daily activities. That does not make sense to the participants at the mealsites too many times. They come in and talk for half an hour after the meal when ev- erybody is all full and sleepy. Besides, half of the people have to run to catch the bus that if they don't catch they will not get back home, in order to have some transportation back to where they need to be; and then we pass out pamphlets. You know, I think the health education folks in this country have demonstrated with a great deal of clarity that the simple presentation of information has the least success of any education intervention possible. You get a pamphlet that says, \"Read Label.\" Do you take that pamphlet with you to the store and read labels? Have you ever done that? Chances are, you do not. If we expect people to make nutritionally healthy choices and changes, they need to have skill developed to do that. They need to have had that experience. They need to know what it is like to translate guidelines and principles from the classroom to the home. Too often, even the information is not appropriate or \"accessi- ble\" to participants, intellectually, financially, culturally, and logis- tically. If we had 100,000 volunteers, like some of the older panelists we had this morning, to go out and do that kind of nutrition educa- tion, then we would really begin to make some progress in that area. I think that we are underusing our mealsites as ideal settings for recognizing that nutrition is more than just food in terms of health promotion. For example, the relationship between physical fitness and nutrition, particularly if we look at something like osteoporo- sis, is critical.74 The evidence is beginning to be very clear that the best interven- tion is one that combines increased calcium and weight-bearing ex- ercise. We need to use our nutrition sites to look at issues of medication management because, again, we have food/drug interactions that cause great problems. An example may be that in the State of New Mexico we have a 73 percent higher than the national average rate of fatal falls among people over 75. We know, in terms of fatal or disabling falls nationwide, that a good number of those are caused by brittle bones-that is, osteopor- osis-with medication used, many of the fatal falls that occur at night have to do with medications that people are taking-also lack of balance and coordination that plays a role. People would be able to make some impact on that if they had a good physical fit- ness program. We don't have a State or Federal policy that encourages address- ing those types of issues. Rita is right: we do have a good emphasis in this State to try to develop fitness programs at least. But unless those kinds of interventions are handed down from the policy level, local providers are not likely to be responding to it. They feel, as many others do in a resource-scarce arena, \"I am already doing more than I should, and how can I take on one more thing?\" So unless it is mandated, it is not going to happen. Despite these shortcomings, there is progress being made. For ex- ample, here in the city of Albuquerque, Ron Montoya, the director of the Office of Senior Affairs, is working personally with his cooks and menu planners to try to develop, in Bernalillo County, optimal- ly nutritional meals, and that is something that could be happen- ing in every county in the State. In our PSA, Valerie Conner, who was unable to be here today, has been working on the bid specifications for menus and trying to develop large wholesale purchase of menu-planning schemes sothat those people who are out in rural sites where they prepare very small numbers of meals, for example, can take advantage of price breaks on more healthy kinds of ingredients. The New Mexico State Agency on Aging and the Institute for Ge- rontological Research and Education at NMSU recently sponsored a training conference that focused on health promotion in aging. They had more than 300 persons participating, including between 30 and 40 people participating in a series of four workshops on im- proving nutrition for the aging meal programs. What I would like to do now is share with you some recommen- dations I have for how to address these few problems I mentioned and others that time constraints preclude discussing. First of all, I think we have to provide the U.S. Administration on Aging, which has responsibility for the Older Americans Act and its programs, with some clout. I think unless it comes from the top down in terms of policy, it is not going to happen. What we have done in the past few years is significantly erodethe authority of the Federal agency to set down policy and send down guidelines, particularly when it comes to doing something in- novative like taking an optimally healthy health promotion per- spective with the mealsites.75 I think we need to encourage and support activities programs which recognize the optimal health for elders is a whole list of things. It is nutrition; it is fitness; it is stress management. It is more than just food. I think we need to provide adequate funding in order to employ or contract with nutritionists at least at the planning and service area level in most of this country. That needs to be money that is set aside for this purpose, not money that comes out of existing meal program budgets. We have already demonstrated that the existing dollars are not adequate to meet the need. The same thing applies to nutrition education. You know, the WIC Program has mandated set-aside funds for nutrition education and that is what we need in our Federal nutri- tion programs, as well. Unless there is a set aside, people are not going to reduce the number of meals in order to provide good nutri- tion education. If we want to make nutrition education work in the most cost- effective way, we need to take advantage of the wonderful re- sources out there in our older persons themselves. That is, we need to encourage and support both paid and volunteer experiences of peer facilitators and peer educators to provide some of the nutri- tion and health promotion education programs that are needed. Finally, we need to support and encourage research in nutrition, as you were saying, Dr. Blumberg, and other panelists indicated, but not just basic science research that relates to nutrition and aging because even if we had all of the evidence in hand about what people should-so, unless we similarly had evidence about what kinds of approaches to nutrition education, what kinds of techniques for motivation would actually enable people to apply that information, the information in and of itself is useless. So I would encourage support for research and demonstration projects that develop effective strategies for improving nutrition be- haviors among older persons. If we improve content, quality, preparation, and presentation of the meals that we serve under title III-C, and if we will offer the most effective possible nutrition education to elders and their fami- lies, then we will make meaningful progress toward reducing dis- ease, disability, and health care costs of older citizens. If the goal of older Americans is an optimally independent healthy old age-and I think it is-then our nutrition programs can provide them with one critically important tool for achieving that goal. Thank you. [Applause.] Senator BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. That is an excellent sort of clean-up-hitter testimony there. [The prepared statement of Dr. Fallcreek follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHANIE FALUCREE , D.S.W. I want to thank you Senator Bingaman, your staff members, members and staff members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging for this opportunity to address some very critical issues. I particularly appreciate your leadership Senator Binga- man in the area of health promotion. This hearing of course is a prime example of your advocacy for elderly and your efforts to bring attention and activity to the con- cept of health promotion with elders.76 As the tried and true commercial says \"if you've got your health you've got justabout everything.\" Every day we are learning more about just how important goodnutrition is to good health. For many years we have been aware of how critical nu-trition is to child and maternal health. We have programs ranging from public edu-cation campaigns, to school lunch programs, to special assistance programs for Women, Infants, and Children (the WIC program). Rita Maes and others have iden- tified today some of the components of our primary federally funded nutrition pro-gram for older citizens, the meals program supported by Title III of the Older Amer-ican's Act. While the size of that program is impressive, feeding many elder Ameri- cans, and while its coverage is nationwide, reaching into urban ghettos and ruralisolation as well as small town and suburban American, the program also has some very real deficits. Some of these can be improved through changes in the Title III program itself, some require more and stronger thoughtful administrative involve-ment at the state and federal level, and others required the infusion of new fundsand/or new priorities in Title III and in other legislated activities. First, although we have learned much in the past few years about nutrition,health, and aging, much remains to be discovered. Major research initiatives are needed more closely to examine the relationships between nutrient needs and specif- ic as well as general health conditions. For example, we know very little about therequirement of older adults for specific vitamins and minerals in terms of quantityneeded, most usable form of ingestion, etc. In fact, there is not yet a single nutrient for which there is a recommended daily allowance for men and women over 65. Theevidence about the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis, vitamin D andosteoporposis, and osteoporosis is becoming daily more clear. It seems likely that re-search will be able to identify other nutritional needs which has similar significantimplications for health and well-being. of elders. However, in the absence of well-researched specific nutrient guidelines, we will continue to deliver nutritional mealsto needy elders. This suggests that our programs in that area should be based uponthe most promising balance possible between available research evidence, the clini- cal experience of nutritionists and other service providers, and the most prudent, logical commonsense guidelines feasible. An analogy which comes to mind for me is how we provided cigarettes at no orreduced cost as a reinforcement or reward to military personnel for many years. Itis true that all the evidence was not in. And it is true that the troops liked and asked for their smoky preferences. And it is true that they complained if they didn'tget them. But considere the cost in terms of health and well-being, in terms of pro-ductivity, and in terms of health care expenditures for care of cancer and heartattack victims. Although not as dramatically or as clearly, we may be taking some-what the same approach in our federally supported meal programs. Consider come tentative research evidence which hears directly on the way inwhich we design and deliver congregate and home-delivered meals:Older people typically need fewer calories than younger adults, at least partiallydue to decreased physical activity. The body's needs for vitamins and minerals may not be decreased and in some cases, may even be increased (i.e. calcium). Constipation disproportinately presents problems to older adults.There appears to be a relationship between hypertension and sodium, excess calo-ries and obesity, cholestrol saturated and unsaturated fats and arteriosclerotic dis-eases to mention only a few examples. Yet, our meal sites too often offer high fat, high sodium, low fiber meals whichnonetheless do meet the guidelines regarding required caloric values per meal.Little is done which takes into account the evidence we do have.I have eaten or visited in too many meal sites where salt is the only seasoningavailable to participants, sugar is automatically rather than exceptionally put inthe ice tea (which of course is high in caffeine), non-fat milk is not an availablechoice, fruit is not available as an alternative to highly sugared desserts, and wholewheat bread is nowhere to be seen. I am not advocating, currently, that less healthy choices be denied people. Rather,I am recommending that more healthy choices be offered. At the very least give ourelder citizens the opportunity to make health-enhancing nutritional choices. Let usfurther respond to what is known and whereever possible increase the calciumavailable in the foods offered, increase the fiber and decrease the fats and sodium.There should be little controversy in these suggestions, and yet it is the unusualnutrition site which makes the optimum effort along these lines. The reasons forthese nutritional shortcomings are several, including for example: Lack of consensus among nutritionists which allows meal planners and providersto argue that they needn't change until the \"experts\" get their act together.77 Lack of readily available menus and instructions for group meal preparation andpresentation which emphasize an optimally healthy nutrition perspective. Lack of funding for nutritionists at the PSA and State level in many locations, including most of New Mexico. Lack of awareness and skill among site managers, cooks, and other providers ofoptimally healthy nutrition principles. Lack of experience among major food suppliers with ingredients which offer morehealthy nutrients (e.g. ground turkey, fresh fruits and vegetables). Resistance, or more realistically, anticipated resistance, among participants tochanges in the meals toward a healthier diet (perhaps, the' do want to largeamounts of unhealthy fats, sugars, and salts or perhaps they haven't been offeredany tasty alternatives). A third problem area relates to the lack of adequate nutrition education at themeal sites. Although nutrition education is mandated typically, very little of sub-stance is offered. When the trade off is a little bit more nutrition education or acouple more meals provided, increasing the body count is most likely to win. Thesite manager also may find it much easier to provide a few extra meals than eventhe most token form of nutrition education. A lack of program development and de-livery skills among site managers of course compounds this problem. Also, thedearth of nutritionists and/or other nutrition educators further complicates the sit-uation. Fourth, the meal sites could be ideal settings for activities to improve overallhealth and well-being of participants. The relationship between diet and exercise interms of chronic disease management (e.g. diabetes, arthritis, and hypertension) as well as disease prevention and health promotion is increasingly clear. Yet, for themost part we have so far failed to take advantage of this opportunity. We could, for example, offer daily exercise programs, whether stretching, strengthening, or aero-bic activities, daily before meal service, which would certainly benefit the majorityof diners. Other health promotion education could take place after the meals, deal-ing with areas such as medication management, accident prevention (incidentally, we have a 73% higher than the national average rate of fatal falls among people over 75), physical fitness, use of preventive health services, preventive mentalhealth, etc. Yet too rarely are the \"extra\" programs and activities of the meal sitesfocused on these important issues, many of which incidentally relate also to nutri-tion. Despite these and other shortcomings in Title III services, program can be and is being made. For example, the Director of the Albuquerque Office of Senior Affairs,Ron Montoya, is personnally working with his cooks toward developing and imple-menting more healthful meals, with a greater emphasis on use of vegetables, com-plementary proteins, and baking and broiling rather than frying and breading.TIGRE recently has been working with several sites in Dona Ana County, doing anutritional computer analysis of the menus. The contractor there, Services for Sen-iors, already has been effective in reducing unneccesarily high fat content in themenus and moving overall toward healthier patterns. Similarly, Ms. Connor, the nutritionist in PSA, is working with the bid specifica-tions to institute healthier alternatives, such as use of ground turkey rather thanhigher fat meats, in many dishes. Recently, TIGRE and the New Mexico StateAgency on Aging sponsored a health promotion conference which included four ses-sions or nutrition site personnel on improving nutrition. Dietary analysis for indi-vidual meal site participants also appears to show much promise. At least partici-pants are interested in finding out more about the quality of their daily nutrition habits. What then can be done to improve the health and well-being of elder citizens interms of nutrition and through our meal site programs? Provide the U.S. Adminsitration on Aging with language in the Older American'sAct and clout in the regulations which implement the Act to oversee and ensurethat nutrition programs are implemented to be optimally health-enhancing.Provide adequate funding for mandated nutritionist at the PSA level, whose re-sponsibility will be to integrate a health promotion approach in congregate andhome delivered meal programs and who will coordinate or at least oversee the pro- vision of meaningful nutrition education for meal site participants, other elders, andcaregiving family members.Support training for nutrition site staff, including peer workers-paid and volun-teer, to enable them to improve the quality of nutrition site programs.Increase the support and use of older workers in a variety of programs related toproviding health-promoting services in conjunction with Title III programs, includ-ing paid and volunteer positions. Include nutrition education as a mandated service in Title III programs with ade-quate support which does not cut back the number of meals-served.78 Support and encourage research in nutrition and aging, including basic researchinto the relationships between nutrition and health as well as research and demon-stration activities develop effective strategies which result in improved nutritionamong elders at meal sites, at home, and elsewhere.If we will improve content, food quality, preparation and presentation of themeals we serve under Title III and if we will offer the most effectih 2 possible nutri-tion education to elders and their families, then we will make meaningful progresstoward reducing disease, disability, and health care costs for elder citizens. If thegoal of older Americans is an optimally independent healthy old age, and I think itis, then our nutrition programs can provide them with one important vehicletoward acheiving that goal. Senator BINGAMAN. Doctor, did you have some questions foreither one of the witnesses? Dr. BLUMBERG. No, I think both of the presentations were very:good and, I think, touched on the points. I guess I would like to just make one comment, though, Dr. Fall-creek. I think that there is, in fact, a great deal of consensus onmost of the important issues by nutrition scientists with regard todietary fats, and calcium, and fiber, and so on. I think the basic problem comes at much higher levels withregard to what the definitions ought to be for preventing deficien-cies or trying to promote optimal health. I think the problems lie alittle more in policy than in terms of what our understanding onnutrition really is. Dr. FALLCREEK. I could not agree more. Senator BINGAMAN. OK. Why don't we conclude everything,since we are running late anyway. Let me thank everybody again, the panelists in particular butalso the people who have come and taken an interest in watchingand listening to the testimony today. We are going to show this half-hour film. Some of you may nothave been here the first time I mentioned it. It is a film that putsyou through a short quiz on how to live longer.It is produced by Hoffman-LaRoche. We are going to put that onthe video machine here if anybody wants to see it. There are ques-tionnaires that are available that go along with the quiz.The testimony that you have heard here is in written form onthe table outside. If any of you want to pickup copies and have not,please do so. We are going to leave the hearing record open untilJanuary 15, in case there are comments or additional statementsthat anybody would like to make. Rita, did you have a statement to make? Ms. MAES. I don't have a statement, Senator, but I did want toinform the audience that Valerie Conner from the SouthwesternArea Agency on Aging was unable to make it. Because of the timelimitations, we were unable to highlight her testimony.However, as Senator Bingaman said, her testimony is outside.Please get a copy. She specifically talks about the Hispanic elderlyin the southwestern portion of the State.Thank you so much. Senator BINGAMAN. Yes, it is very good testimony and I recom-mend it to you. We will insert that statement and additional com-ments of Ms. Amertius Burroughs in the record and a statementwe have received from Ms. Ophelia Rinaldi.Again, I want to thank everybody for being here. Dr. Blumberg, we appreciate you being here in particular. [At this time, the hearing was concluded.]APPENDIX MATERLAL RELATED TO HEARING FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIVITIES TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF NUTRITION The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) efforts to increase public awareness of nutrition take many forms, including developing food labeling regulations relating to the nutritional content of foods. Primarily, however, FDA engages in a host of educational initiatives to inform consumers, health professionals, scientific advisors, industry and its associations, professional and citizen organizations, Congress, State agencies, and foreign governments on a wide variety of nutritional issues. The means used to inform these groups are as varied as the groups themselves. Under the general heading of communication and education, FDA has been actively involved in the following: o responding to over 50,000 consumer letters and inquiries a year which request Information on food and nutrition, etc.; o publishing and circulating the magazine FDA Consumer which has dedicated numerous articles to nutrition and related areas; o reprinting 100,OO of these articles from the FDA Consumer which are provided free on request to FDA or through the Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colorado. (79)80 -2 - o maintaining a staff of about 34 Consumer Affairs Officers throughout FDA district offices who serve as a liaison to consumers and health professionals. Approximately one-half of their time is dedicated to food and nutrition issues; o conducting surveys to determine consumer interests and needs; o participating in numerous national initiatives to study and improve nutrition, such as the Surgeon General's Report on Diet, Nutrition and Health, Nutrition Education Task Force, Nutrition Objectives for the Nation 1990, and the recently published Dietary Guidelines for Americans; o participating in national meetings through speeches on FDA's current activities and policies; and o publishing regulations and guidelines to increase the nutrition information provided to consumers on food labeling.81 -3- Sodium Initiative One area which has involved virtually all of the above activities has been sodium awareness and reduction. In response to the growing medical concern over sodium in the diet, FDA in 1981 launched a major Initiative to provide more information to consumers about the association between sodium consumption and hypertension; provide consumers with a wider choice of foods with reduced sodium content; and reduce the amount of sodium added to foods. Specifically, the initiative has involved educating the public about sodium through a variety of means. Including the dissemination of brochures and the airing of radio and television public service announcements; monitoring changes in sodium consumption; and Increasing sodium content labeling on processed foods by adding a sodium information requirement to our nutrition labeling regulations. In 1978, FDA conducted a nationwide consumer survey in which the following question was asked of approximately 1,400 individuals who read ingredient labels: As a result of reading ingredient listings. what are you avoiding or limitinq in your diet? In 1978, only 14 percent of those participating In the survey indicated that they were trying to avoid or limit sodium intake. By the end of 1983 this figure had nearly tripled to 40 percent. This survey will be conducted again in the spring of 1986.82 -4 - Another Indication of consumer awareness is the number of inquiries received by FDA. Consumer inquiries pertaining to \"sodium\" have taken an almost three-fold leap from 1983 to 1984. In 1983, FDA received approximately 6,400 inquiries on sodium; in 1984, FDA received over 17,000 inquiries and requests for sodium publications. Inquiries on \"sodium\" constitute the single largest area of consumer interest. ScJium Labelinq To further encourage manufacturers to reduce added sodium in processed food and to make more information available about the sodium content of foods, FDA's nutrition labeling regulations were revised to require that labels that provide full nutrition information will also include the milligrams of sodium contained in each serving. In addition, the regulations specify and define the sodium-related terms that may be used in labeling. These include \"sodium-free\" (used when there is less than 5 milligrams of sodium per serving), \"very low sodium' (35 milligrams less), \"low sodium\" (140 milligrams or less), \"reduced sodium\" (processed to reduce the usual level of sodium by at least 75 percent), and \"unsalted\" (processed without salt whereas the food normally is processed with salt). These terms are designed to enhance consumer understanding by indicating relative amounts of sodium in various foods, ensure consistency in the marketplace, and prevent potential consumer confusion which might arise without standardized terminology.83 The sodium labeling revisions to the regulations will become effective across-the-board on July 1. 1986 to allow manufacturers sufficient time to prepare the new labeling and avoid any increase in costs to consumers if existing label inventories for slow-moving products could not be utilized. Manufacturers have promised that in many cases they will add sodium declarations before this date as current label inventories are depleted. Potassium Labeling The current nutrition labeling regulations have also been amended to provide for potassium content information expressed as milligrams of potassium in a serving of food to be placed on the label immediately following the sodium content. Unlike the sodium requirement, the potassium provisions are not required as part of nutrition labeling since available data do not suggest any public health concern about current or anticipated levels of potassium consumption by the American population as a whole. National Cholesterol Education Program Saturated fatty acid and dietary cholesterol deserves special attention in our nutrition awareness and labeling program, and barriers to more informative labeling should be removed. In many respects, however, FDA's efforts in this area are just beginning, as evidenced by the fact that only six percent of FDA-regulated foods contain specific cholesterol information on their labels. This situation needs to Improve, and FDA's published regulatory program commits the Agency to action in this area.84 -6- To increase public awareness, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has begun developing a National Cholesterol Education Program to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality attributed toelevated blood cholesterol. Many organizations and agencies have assisted the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in developing strategies for this new effort, including FDA, USDA, the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association. Its goals will be accomplished through the development of a national educational effort and throuoh extensive cooperation and coordination with other Government agencies and intermediary groups in the private sector. This new program was kicked-off last month. Since March there have been six strategy development meetings, involving Government members and the medical community, to chart the future course of the program. FnA will be involved in several aspects of this program, including advisino institutions and supermarket chains on appropriate fat and dietary cholesterol shelf-labeling initiatives and meeting with industry on the development of low-fat, modified fat and lower dietary cholesterol products (includino encouraging labeling which emphasizes that foods derived from the plant kinodom are cholesterol-free). FDA is involved in development of criteria and proposed improvements in cholesterol labeling, coupled with fatty acid labeling. Moreover, FDA has publicly announced that it is presently developing an amendment to its labelinq repulations that will propose terms for use on labeling (e.g., \"cholesterol free,\" \"low cholesterol,\" and 'reduced cholesterol\"), in conjunction with quantitative cholesterol declarations, that will be helpful to the consumer and prevent misleading labeling.85 item 2 ILK (RCfy of vilbialuerup S ^ B ~~~~~P.O. BOX12an ALBEUQUEUQUE. NEW MEX ICO S710 v 9 ~~~~~~ ~Decembcr 16, 1985 Senator Jeff Bingaman 502 Hart Senate Office Bldg. Washington, DC 20510 Attention: Faith Roessel Dear Senator Bingaman: Please accept the following written testimony as input to the field hearing entitled: The Relationship Between Nutrition, Aging, and Health: A Personal-and Social Challenge. As funding tightens, we must prioritize services. In my opinion, health care services, especially, preventive health care services, as-< top priority. Good nutrition is a main ingredient to good health. Yet, there are many elderly in our society of whom lack good nutrition which threatens their over-all well-being. Some elderly are unable to prepare or search-out a well balanced meal for themselves, due to health problems. So it becomes a vicious cycle in which present health problems impede good nutrition which in turn impedes improvement in health. Many elderly, due to the lack of financial resources, are unable to purchase more nutritious foods or enough food to support a well-balanced food diet. For many seniors of whom receive a lunch meal at senior meal- sites and/or senior centers, it may very well be their only meal of the day. It is probably their most nutritious. Please see attachments, which explain some senior nutrition services in Bernalillo County. Transportation is a critical issue in providing meal services to the elderly. Many elderly are unable to transport themselves or lack transportation. Some elderly are home-bound.and need meals delivered to their residence. I feel, strongly, that we must continue to support and expand nutrition services to the elderly. We need to, especially, target those elderly most in need. AN EOUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER 62-178 0 -86 -486 Senator Jeff Bingaman Page 2 December 16. 1985 Presently, there is no means testing for elderly individuals of whom are eligible for Older American Act, Title IIIC nutrition services. Donations are encouraged, but no fees are required. If the lack of funding reaches critical levels, we may have to implement means testing to more accurately target those elderly most in need. I'm unsure if this is a viable alternative. In closing, nutrition services are a vital component to the continum of care services for the elderly. Very truly yours,, Ken Villani, Coordinator Area Agency on Aging KV/tb Attachments87 NUTRITION PRUCRAM NARRATIVE USA's Nutrition program is responsible for the direct delivery of meals services at fifteen meal sites throughout Bernalillo County. USA provides supporting social services at thirteen of those sites while two are managed by other agencies. A total of 1,065 Nutrition program memls are provided daily. Weekend meals will be provided to 100 homebound elders throughout the program year. Congregate Nutrition Service Delivery The anticipated number of congregate meals to be served to the area's elderly population during FY 1985 under the auspices of OSA's Nutrition program is 835 daily meals. Of the 208,750 congregate meals 104,337 will be provided by non-Older Americans Act Funds. In addition to the meal itself, all existing supporting social services for the elderly of Bernalillo County are available to the participants of all meal sites. These coordinated services include transportation, recreation, preventive health education. and screening of all services of the Information & Referral and Outreach components of OSA. Meal site workers and OSA Outreach workers identify and incorporate into the Nutrition program those elders with the greatest social and economic needs.88 Nutrition Program Narrative Page 2 The menu planning process involves participant input in two ways: (1) the Nutrition Project Advisory Council reviews the proposed menu on a monthly basis at its regular meetings and suggest changes when a consensus can be reached; (2) results of the food quality monitoring system which is conducted daily at all meal sites by participants are reviewed prior to menu planning and consideration of these results are taken when planning the following months menus. Using the above process, six week menu cycles are developed by the program staff in cooperation with Nutrition program cooks. Each cycle is repeated once, after which a new menu is developed, coinciding with the seasons/fiscal quarters. Menus are calculated to determine each day's nutrient content and to ascertain whether they contain a minimum 1/3 of the current recommended dietary allowance as established by the National Academy of Science's National Research Council. Consideration is given at all times to provide a wide variety of entrees, including ethnic selections commensurate with religious and cultural backgrounds of the participants. The Nutrition program is the recipient of USDA commodities for use in its meals program. Care is taken at all times to incorporate into the menu those selections which are nutritionally valuable and to avoid foods which may be detrimental to participant's general state of health (highly salted and/or sweetened foods). Special menus are not available to participants of the program having specific dietary needs. Complaints about nutrition service delivery and menu selection are handled on a daily basis through the monitoring system used by all meal sites. One participant from John Marshall, SMSC and North Valley is selected weekly to evaluate the quality and selection of food being served. The participant completes a standard form developed for this purpose and the information therein is relayed in writing to the administrative office of the Nutrition program. The Nutrition program coordinates with the Easter Seals Society, Inc., for the provision of transportation; with the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the Diabetes Foundation for periodic health screening. Approximately 2,500 persons will be served during the program year, of which 82% are minority and 70% are low income. Non-eligible participants (those who have not yet reached the age of 60 or who are not married to someone this age or above) are considered as guests at meal sites and are requested to pay $1.75.89 Nutrition Program Narrative Page 3 The selection of meal site locations is based upon available demographic data and, as such, target populations of elderly people in the greatest social and economic need are identified and nutrition services made available to this group. Methods used to reduce and/or contain meals costs, thereby enabling the program to expand its services includes the preparation and freezing of weekend home-delivered meals during the normal work hours of staff cooks rather than specially purchasing prepared meals or extending the staff cooks' work hours into the weekend. Baked goods are purchased from a commercial bakery. Participants are encouraged to make contributions for the meals they receive in order to partially offset the total cost of the meal provided. A minimum donation of 60 0 per meal is suggested program-wide, although 'Fair Share' contributions, based on a sliding scale of participants' monthly income, is encouraged. Signs to this effect are posted at all sites. Non-eligible participants must pay for their meals. This charge covers the cost of raw food and cooking personnel but does not include extraneous expenses such as space, utilities or support personnel. These expenses are absorbed by the City of Albuquerque and are considered as contributions. Lunch tickets are issued at the time a participant offers his donation and are collected by the site worker as the meal is being served to individuals. At the conclusion of the meal. the site worker and a volunteer together count the daily receipts and this amount is reported to the office of the program director. Contributions are deposited daily by program personnel into the bank with which the City does business. Disbursements are made from this account for allowable program operations costs. Home Delivered Meal Service Delivery The Nutrition program will provide 230 daily home delivered meals on 250 serving days to the frail and isolated elderly of the communrty. In addition, 100 of these elders receive weekend meals which are delivered frozen on Friday. These 100 people, it has been determined by a survey, have no means of preparing weekend meals themselves, nor do they have family to assume this responsibility for them. The weekday meals are prepared in program kitchens, delivered in bulk to nearby meal sites in heated food transporters and individually packed at the site for delivery to participants' homes. Food temperatures are maintained at the optimum 1040 level through90 Nutrition Program Narrative Page 4 the use of specially designed food carriers. Home delivered meals are delivered by two station wagons throughout the county daily. Maximum delivery time between preparation site and participant is 1 1/2 hours. Referrals to the Nutrition program for home delivered meals are made by OSA Outreach workers and Information and Referral specialists based on the level of need indicated during an initial interview with the client. A complete assessment is done by a caseworker and eligibility is determined by specific indicators. These indicators include physical and mental condition as well as the availability of family assistance. Eligibility criteria for participation in the home delivered portion of the Nutrition program include the following considerations: (1) physical health; (2) mental health; (3) mobility; (4) availability of transportation; and (5) availability of family assistance in preparing a Noon meal for the homebound elderly applicant. Applicants are re-evaluated bimonthly by meal site workers and OSA outreach workers for continued eligibility. meals on Wheels, a private non-profit agency providing home delivered meals, works very closely with the Nutrition program in the delivery of home delivered meals services. Since Meals on Wheels has a set fee for its daily meals, that agency refers those elders who are financially unable to buy their services to the Nutrition program. In addition to the regular coordination that exists between the two agencies, the City's Nutrition program subcontracts with Meals on Wheels for the preparation and delivery of 22 daily home delivered meals to residents of the La Mesa neighborhood. The estimated number of people to be served during 1986 will be 250. Identification of persons with the greatest social and economic need for home delivered meal services include the eligibility criteria enumerated above, as well as the individual's income level. Income is considered to ascertain whether the applicant is able to financially afford Meals on Wheels services. Program income is collected weekly from the participants by the driver who delivers the meals. The program-wide suggested contribution amount applies to the home delivered meals as well as the congregate meals.

I am also an Adult Nurse Practitioner and have recently worked in Nursing Homes and health programs in Senior Citizen residences. I wish to address two problems related to nutrition in the elderly that were only dealt with briefly in the hearing. In addition i want to .mention plans developing in our College that will impact on these problems. A major factor in malnutrition in the elderly is failure to ask for assistance due to fearing loss of independence. Numerous related problems such as decreased mobility, pain, sleep problems, depression, inadequate support systems, breathing and circulation as well as medication effects must be addressed if nutrition is to he improved. _ ____ Another important nutritional problem of the elderly is obesity. This adversely affects mobility and self care as well as sleep, comfort, and self-esteem. Such complicated problems with numerous interrelated factors affecting both please Prints N.MME Sara J. Anderson, R.N., M.S-N. ADnRFSS College of Menico 87131 T1ELEpBONF,'103 Senator Bingaman Page 2 causation and appropriate intervention require approaches which are knowledgeable, individualized and long-tern. A strong emphasis on supportive counseling, behavior modification and mobilization of family and community resources is reqlr.'d. Professional nurses by education and experience are prepared to deal with these problems effectively. The College of Nursing at the University of New Mexico, in collaboration with the State Agency on Aging, is presently planning a Geriatric Nursing Clinic. Services will include individual clinic appointments, home visits plus group health teaching and support groups. Another major goal of the clinic will be to develop a model of community based, professional nursing care which will be promoted and taught to other nurses in this community and state-wide. This effort can serve as a major resource in alleviating some of the most difficult nutritional problems of the elderly. emg104 -4, = 4 u --nitrd *tates ** nate * w* Q -'~~\"-C~ SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING WASHINGTON.

I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AGING SINCE 1976 AS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR A SENIOR PROGRAM, NUTRITIONIST WITH THE STATE AGENCY ON AGING AND AS A HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH BUREAU IN SANTA FE. SANDOVAL COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES, INC., SERVES THE ELDERLY IN CORRALES, RIO RANCHO, BERNALILLO, PLACITAS, ALGODONES, JEMEZ VALLEY. CUBA AND PENA BLANCA. WE ARE CURRENTLY SERVING APPROXIMATELY 5400 MEALS A MONTH. OF THESE APPROXIMATELY 3000 MEALS ARE SERVED TO LOW-INCOME ELDERLY. ALL OF THESE ARE LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS. ALSO APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THESE ARE HISPANICS. THE PROGRAM SERVES PEW AMERICAN INDIANS AS MOST OF THESE ARE SERVED BY THE INDIVIDUAL PUEBLOS THROUGH DIRECT FUNDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING. SANDOVAL COUNTY RANKS THIRD HIGHEST IN TERMS OF FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS. A LARGE NUMBER OP THESE ARE ELDERLY. THERE ARE NO STATISTICAL DATA ON INCIDENCE OF HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION AMONG THIS COUNTY'S ELDERLY. THERE HAS SEEN. HONEVER, MUCH CONCERN BY STAFF AS TO THE ADEQUATE NUTRITION OF SOME OF OUR PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO LIVE ALONE OR ARE HOME BOUND. IN SOME CASES THE MEAL RECEIVED THROUGH TEE PROGRAM MAY BE THE ONLY DAILY BALANCED MEAL CONSUMED. THE HIGH COST OF LIVING HAS ERRODED THE BUYING POWER OF THE ELDERLY'S INCOME RESOURCES. RUST ARE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF PAYING THEIR BILLS AND VERY OFTEN RESORT TO LOW-COST FOOD ITEMS WHICH DO NOT MEET THEIR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS IN ORDER TO STRETCH THEIR DOLLARS.116 MY STAFF HAS REPORTED THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TAEN- ELDERLY GROCERY SHOPPING SOME DO A LOT OP LOOKING BUT LITTLE BUYING. IF WHMA HAPPENS-AMONG OUR ELDERLY LOW-INCOME HISPANICS IN SANDOVAL COUNTY CAN BE VIlEO STATE WIDE, THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY OF OUR ANCIANOS WHOSE NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY MET DUE TO PROBLME OF HEALTH, INCOME, TRANSPORTATION AND OTHERS. THE NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR THE ELDERLY MAY NOT SOLVE ALL THE NUTRITION PROBLEMS OF THE AGED BUT FOR THOSE PARTICIPANTS WHO REALLY NEED THAT ONE BALANCED MEAL A DAY IT MAY MEAN A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. 0 62-178 (120) "}
