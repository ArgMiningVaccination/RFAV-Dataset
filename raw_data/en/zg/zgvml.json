In times of pandemic keep your distance, wash your hands, wear a mask and stay at home. Gemstones have a long history of use as spiritual and physical healers with every culture incorporating them in medicinal, astrological, religious or magical practices.

Meditate with one in your hand or on the floor beside you or place one on the bedside table while you sleep. Finally a word about the Chakras, the ancient Hindu philosophy which says that the body contains a number of Chakra points. Each point has an influence over certain physical and mental features. Generally, but not always, the gemstones connected to the Heart Chakra, are green. Here are a few that can heal or unblock a troubled Chakra: Aventurine Aventurine a cheering gemstone and a heart healer.
