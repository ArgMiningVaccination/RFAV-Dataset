Each year during the first week of October the nation celebrates the Interfaith National Day of Prayer for Behavioral Health and Understanding. This day is designated to bring together mental health and substance abuse networks and faith leaders to work together so that they may recognize the importance of behavioral health issues in our community. Prayers and actions of both faith communities and secular organizations, such as the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI), are needed to restore mental wellness in America. By seeking guidance with each of our faiths, we can recommit ourselves to replacing misinformation, blame, fear and prejudice with truth and love in order to offer hope to all who are touched by mental illness.
