(7) A presiding of ficer shall abstain from public comment about a pending or impending contested case proceeding that might reasonably be expected to af fect the outcome or impair the fairness of the proceeding, and shall require similar abstention by agency personnel subject to the presiding of ficer ' s direction and control. This subparagraph does not prohibit a presiding of ficer from making public statements in the course of of ficial duties or from explaining for public information the hearing procedures of agencies. (8) A presiding of ficer shall not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated to adjudicative duties, nonpublic information acquired in an adjudicative capacity except as lawfully permissible in the performance of of ficial duties by an agency head or member of a multimember agency head. (9) A presiding of ficer shall report any violation of this code to the appropriate authority for any disciplinary proceedings provided by law . b. Disqualification.

In a situation where a presiding of ficer knows of information which might reasonably be deemed to be a basis for disqualification and decides voluntary withdrawal is unnecessary , the presiding of ficer shall disclose the relevant information on the record and shall state reasons why voluntary withdrawal is unnecessary . 10.29(4) Canon 4. An administrative law judge shall regulate extrajudicial activities to minimize the risk of conflict with judicial duties. In general, an administrative law judge shall conduct all of the administrative law judge' s extrajudicial activities so that the administrative law judge does not: 1.

Ch 25, p. 4 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 25.4(1) The applicant shall be an independent business. The following list describes elements of a business which indicate independent status. a. The tar geted group person owner(s) shall enjoy the customary incidents and profits of ownership and shall share in the risks commensurate with their ownership interest. This shall be demonstrated by the substance rather than the form of the arrangements. T itle and authority shall be commensurate with ownership and control. b. The business shall be owned, operated and actively managed by the same people, a single management. c. A board of directors and stockholders shall each have a membership comprised of at least 51 percent tar geted group persons. d. The applicant business shall be compensated for facilities, inventory , equipment, labor , or other items which it owns and shares with any other business. Compensation shall not vary from common industry practice. e. The tar geted group person owner(s) shall have independent authority and ability to incur liability and to decide financial and policy questions. The business arrangements of owners, directors, of ficers or key employees with businesses which are not minority-, woman-, or persons with disabilities-owned shall not vary from common industry practice. Each industry has practices which dif fer from other industries. f. Independent authority and ability to hire and to fire all personnel shall be vested in the tar geted group person owner(s). g. Recognition of the business as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not solely suf ficient for certification as a tar geted small business. 25.4(2) The tar geted group person owner(s) shall make the business decisions for the business without any restrictions, either formal or informal. This includes, but is not limited to, bylaw provisions, partnership agreements, charter requirements for cumulative voting rights, or employment agreements. 25.4(3) The tar geted group person owner(s) shall direct or cause the direction of the business. The owner(s) shall make day-to-day decisions as well as major decisions on management policy and operation of the business.

Devote substantial time to the business; c. Supervise management and field operations; d. Manage financial af fairs; e. Prepare or approve bids or estimates; f. Participate in price and bidding negotiations; g. Make final decisions about staf f and personnel; h. Sign contracts and checks or authorize their signature. 25.4(4) Any relationship between a TSB and a business which is not a TSB, but which has an interest in the TSB, shall be carefully reviewed to determine if the interest of the non-TSB conflicts with the ownership and control requirements of this rule. 25.4(5) The contributions of capital and expertise by the tar geted group person owner(s) to acquire interest in the business shall be real and substantial. The following list includes acceptable elements of ownership. a. Company documents, such as stock certificates, articles of incorporation, minutes of board meetings, partnership agreements or income tax returns reflect tar geted group person ownership; b. Independent contributions of capital are made by the tar geted group person owner(s). Proof of this independent contribution of capital made by the tar geted group person owner(s) to acquire interest in the business must accompany the certification application; c. Independent contributions of expertise are made by the tar geted group person owner(s). The tar geted group person owner(s) must have an overall understanding of, managerial and technical competence in, and expertise directly related to the type of business in which the firm is engaged IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 25, p. 5 and in the firm' s operations. Generally , expertise limited to of fice management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the activities of the business is insuf ficient to demonstrate control of the business; d. Independent risk of loss and share of profit by the tar geted group person owner(s) are commensurate with their proportion of ownership. Fifty-one percent or more of securities which constitute ownership or control of a corporation for purposes of establishing it as a TSB shall be held directly by tar geted group persons. An inherited business may be eligible for tar geted small business status. Capital contribution, expertise and experience in the inherited business are not required. All other standards apply . Documentation may be required to prove compliance with all standards. 481\u201425.5 (10A) Special consideration. In addition to the above standards, the department may give consideration to other circumstances to determine eligibility . These are to ensure that only bona fide tar geted group person-owned businesses are certified. 25.5(1) A previous or continuing employer -employee relationship between present owners will be carefully reviewed to ensure that the employee-owner has substantial management and decision-making responsibilities. 25.5(2) At the discretion of the department, on-site audits may be conducted to determine eligibility . 481\u201425.6 (10A) Family-owned business. Businesses which are owned and operated by one or more members of the same family will be closely scrutinized to determine whether the tar geted group person identified as the owner of 51 percent or more of the business does in fact set policy and make day-today and long-term decisions for the operation and management of the business. 25.6(1) Any characteristic listed below may be cause to deny tar geted small business status. This list is not to be construed as complete. a. If a nontar geted group person family member: (1) Is chief executive of ficer or president; (2) Provides the expertise to conduct the business; (3) T ransfers ownership to the tar geted group person owner for less than fair market value; (4) Receives compensation equal to or greater than the tar geted group person owner , not commensurate with their ownership; (5) Provides occupational services for the business for less than fair market value; (6) Possesses powers equal to or greater than the tar geted group person owner to direct management and operations. b.

A recent transfer of ownership by a nontar geted group person family member to a tar geted group person will be reviewed to determine if the previous owner is still the principal decision maker on policy or actually manages the existing business. T ransfers in the past two years are considered recent, and these businesses shall not be certified, unless evidence substantiating the transfer is received and approved. If any of the above circumstances prevail, the business shall be considered a family-owned business. Nontar geted group person family-owned businesses are not eligible for certification as tar geted small businesses in Iowa. 25.6(2) If a lending institution requires a signature other than the TSB owner ' s, another person may sign. When this happens, the owner must have the experience and expertise to own and operate the business. If a nontar geted group person family member has the expertise and has cosigned for business loans, the business is not eligible. Ch 25, p. 6 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 481\u201425.7 (10A) Cottage industry . A cottage industry may be eligible for certification as a TSB. Characteristics of these businesses include, but are not limited to: 1. At least 51 percent of business equipment shall be owned by tar geted group persons. 2. Business risks and profits shall be borne by the tar geted group person owner(s) proportionate to their ownership. The intent of tar geting some small businesses is to identify those businesses which have been traditionally excluded from economic growth. Therefore, the following exception is made for cottage industries: E XCEPTION : The residence and any adjacent outbuildings used by the cottage industry may be owned jointly with other family members. All other TSB eligibility standards apply . 481\u201425.8 (10A) Decertification.

A request for an investigation from the public must be written and shall specify the reason(s) why the certified tar geted small business no longer complies with these rules.

The identity of a complainant is confidential pursuant to Iowa Code section 22.7(18). 25.8(4) Eligibility to participate in the TSB program continues until the final decision is issued by the department. 481\u201425.9 (12) Request for bond waiver . A tar geted small business seeking a performance, surety , or bid bond waiver shall submit a sworn statement that it is unable to secure a performance, surety , or bid bond because of lack of experience, lack of net worth, or lack of capital. Documentation will be requested from surety companies that the TSB is unable to obtain performance, surety , or bid bonding because of the lack of experience, lack of net worth, or lack of capital. 25.9(1) A waiver shall be applied only to a prime contract where the project or individual transaction does not exceed $50,000, notwithstanding Iowa Code section 573.2. 25.9(2) Granting a waiver shall not relieve any business from its contractual obligations. The state agency or department may pursue any remedy under law upon default or breach of contract. 25.9(3) The department reviews all bond waiver documents.

An applicant for a performance, surety , or bid bond waiver and the department or agency involved will be notified of the decision by United States mail. 25.9(4) Bond waivers will be reviewed and renewed at the time of TSB recertification. 481\u201425.10 (714) Fraudulent practices in connection with targeted small business pr ograms. A violation under this rule is grounds for decertification of the TSB connected with the violation. Decertification shall be in addition to any penalty otherwise authorized by this chapter . A person is considered to be guilty of a fraudulent practice if the person: 1. Knowingly transfers or assigns assets, ownership, or equitable interest in property of a business to a tar geted group person primarily for the purpose of obtaining benefits under TSB programs if the transferor would otherwise not be qualified for such programs. IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 25, p. 7 2.

Knowingly falsifies information on an application for the purpose of obtaining benefits under TSB programs. The department may investigate allegations or complaints of fraudulent practices and will take action to decertify a TSB upon concluding that a violation has occurred. A decertification by this action may be appealed. 481\u201425.1 1 (17A) Appeal pr ocedur e. Department decisions regarding tar geted small businesses may be contested by an adversely af fected party . Requests for a hearing must be made in writing to the department within 30 days of mailing or serving a decision.

The committee also objects to the \"emer gency\" adoption and implementation of these provisions. Committee members felt that a notice of intended action would have provided an opportunity to discuss and resolve these issues before the licensing provisions were implemented. These provisions implement 2002 Iowa Acts, House File 2620, creating a special license for vendors at farmers markets. Section two of the Act states: For a farmers market wher e potentially hazar dous food is sold or distributed, one seasonal license fee of one hundr ed dollars for each vendor on a countywide basis. It is the opinion of the committee this provision means that a vendor may simultaneously operate a number of stands at a number of locations within a single county for a single fee. Members felt the phrase \"countywide basis\" evidenced a legislative intent that the vendor could operate anywhere within that county at any time. The interpretation set out in ARC 1760B would require a separate license for each separate farmers market where the vendor simultaneously operates. This action is taken pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code \u00a717A.4. The ef fect of this objection is to terminate the emer gency filing 180 days after this objection is filed. Objection filed September 23, 2002.

Ch 64, p. 12 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 481\u201464.62 (135C) Another business or activity in a facility . A facility is allowed to have another business or activity in a health care facility or in the same physical structure of the facility , if the other business or activity is under the control of and is directly related to and incidental to the operation of the health care facility , or the business or activity is approved by the department and the state fire marshal. T o obtain the approval of the department and the state fire marshal, the facility must submit to the department a written request for approval which identifies the service(s) to be of fered by the business and addresses the factors outlined in paragraphs \"a\" through \"j\" of this rule. (I, II, III) 64.62(1) The following factors will be considered by the department in determining whether a business or activity will interfere with the use of the facility by residents, interfere with services provided to residents, or be disturbing to residents: a. Health and safety risks for residents; b. Compatibility of the proposed business or activity with the facility program; c. Noise created by the proposed business or activity; d. Odors created by the proposed business or activity; e. Use of entrances and exits for the business or activity in regard to safety and disturbance of residents and interference with delivery of services; f. Use of the facility' s corridors or rooms as thoroughfares to the business or activity in regard to safety and disturbance of residents and interference with delivery of services; g. Proposed staf fing for the business or activity; h. Sharing of services and staf f between the proposed business or activity and the facility; i. Facility layout and design; and j. Parking area utilized by the business or activity . 64.62(2) Approval of the state fire marshal shall be obtained before approval of the department will be considered. 64.62(3) A business or activity conducted in a health care facility or in the same physical structure as a health care facility shall not reduce space, services or staf f available to residents below minimums required in these rules. (I, II, III) 481\u201464.63 (135C) Respite car e services. Respite care services means an or ganized program of temporary supportive care provided for 24 hours or more to a person in order to relieve the usual caregiver of the person from providing continual care to the person. A facility which chooses to provide respite care services must meet the following requirements related to respite care services and must be licensed as a health care facility . 64.63(1) A facility which chooses to provide respite care services is not required to obtain a separate license or pay a license fee. 64.63(2) Rules regarding involuntary dischar ge or transfer rights do not apply to residents who are being cared for under a respite care contract. 64.63(3) The facility shall have a contract with each resident in the facility . When the resident is there for respite care services, the contract shall specify the time period during which the resident will be considered to be receiving respite care services. At the end of that period, the contract may be amended to extend that period of time. The contract shall specifically state the resident may be involuntarily dischar ged while being considered as a respite care resident. The contract shall meet other requirements for contracts between a health care facility and resident, except the requirements concerning the holding and char ging for a bed when a resident is hospitalized or leaves the facility temporarily for recreational or therapeutic reasons. 64.63(4) Respite care services shall not be provided by a facility to persons requiring a level of care which is higher than the level of care the facility is licensed to provide.

[the department] upon request. Current reports of inspections by State and/or local health authorities are on file, and notations are made of action taken by the facility to correct deficiencies. 483.410(c)(1) The structure and content of the individual' s record must be an accurate, functional representation of the actual experience of the individual in the facility . It must contain enough information to indicate that the facility knows the status of the individual, has adequate plans to intervene, and provides suf ficient evidence of the ef fects of the intervention. ... [The department] must be able to identify this through interviews with staf f, and when possible with individuals being served, as well as through observations. It is the facility' s responsibility to determine how frequently documentation of an individual' s progress takes place apart from the annual review , but good practice dictates that for those developmental and behavioral objectives that are current and have been assigned priority , data showing progress, regression, or no change are a vital and necessary tool for the staf f\u2014not for ... [the department] review , but to of fer staf f guidance for conducting programs or for changing, accelerating, abandoning, rewriting, or whatever is necessary to be responsive to the changing status of the individual as a result of the intervention. For a toilet-training program, for instance, data taking may be continuous, whereas for a gross motor skill, it may be on a fixed ratio schedule (e.g., every 10th trial). The point is, there is not \"right\" frequency for \"reporting\" progress, but there is a reporting schedule for each person based on the way in which his active treatment program unfolds. Be more concerned with whether or not the staf f has suf ficient progress information to work with the individual and less with how often that information is gathered. 483.410(c)(2) \"Keep confidential\" is defined to mean safeguarding the content of information including video, audio, and/or computer stored information from unauthorized disclosure without the specific informed consent of the individual, parent of a minor child, or legal guardian, and consistent with the advocate' s right of access, as required in the Developmental Disabilities Act. Facility staf f and consultants, hired to provide services to the individual, should have access to only that portion of information that is necessary to provide ef fective responsive services to the individual. If there is information considered too confidential to place in the record used by all staf f (e.g., identification of the family' s financial assets, sensitive medical data), it may be retained in a secure place in the facility (e.g., social worker ' s locked desk). A notation must be made in the record of the location of confidential information (e.g., \"Family information is available from the social worker\"). 483.410(c)(4) In cases in which facilities have created the option for an individual' s record to be maintained by computer , rather than hard copy , electronic signatures are acceptable. 483.410(c)(6) \"Appropriate\" means those parts of each individual' s record most likely (or known) to be needed by the residential staf f to carry out the individual' s active treatment program in the unit, to alert staf f to health risks and other aspects of medical treatment, to support the psychosocial needs of the individual, and anything else necessary to the staf f ' s ability to work on behalf of the individual. 483.410(d)(3) \"Assure\" is defined to mean that the facility' s staf f actively participate with staf f in outside programs, in the development of objectives, assessment process, and intervention strategies. Staf f should also share its programs with outside resources. For example, if a public school is implementing a manual communication system with an individual, the direct care staf f in the individual' s living unit should have instructions to implement the program in the residential environment. Likewise, if the facility is implementing a behavior management program for the individual, it should be shared with * Editor ' s Note: V erbatim from federal regulations\u2014neither the Department nor the Administrative Code Editors have attempted to correct inconsistencies in numbering, spelling or grammar . IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 15 and implemented as needed by the outside program. The facility must work closely with the outside program to ensure a comprehensive, integrated, consistent, and ef ficient program of intervention suited to each individual' s needs. Recognize that this communication is often dif ficult, but nevertheless essential to the provision of active treatment. 483.420(a) \"Ensure\" is defined to mean that the facility actively asserts the individual' s rights and does not wait for him or her to claim a right. 483.420(a)(2) The term \"attendant risks of treatment\" refers to a l l treatment, including medical treatment. An individual who refuses a particular treatment (e.g. a behavior control, seizure control medication or a particular intervention strategy) must be of fered a c c e p t a b l e alternatives to the treatment being refused, if acceptable alternatives are available (for example, drug therapy) and their consequences when such alternatives are available. The individual' s preference about alternatives should be elicited and considered in deciding on the course of treatment. If the individual also refuses the alternative treatment, or if no alternative exists to the treatment refused, the facility must consider the ef fect this refusal may have on other individuals, the individual him or herself and the facility , and if it can continue to treat the individual consistent with these regulations. Thus every ef fort must be made to assist the individual to understand and cooperate in the legitimate exercise of the IPP [Individual Program Plan]. An individual being considered for participation in experimental research must be fully informed of the nature of the experiment (e.g., medication, treatment) and understand the possible consequences of participating or not participating. The individual' s written consent must be received prior to participation. For an individual who is a minor or who has been adjudicated as incompetent, the written informed consent of parents of the minor or the legal guardian is required. 483.420(a)(3) The facility must ensure protection of the individual from any form of reprisal or intimidation as a result of a complaint or grievance reported by an individual. 483.420(a)(4) Since the use of money is a right, determine if the facility demonstrated that the individual was unable to be taught how to use money before the decision was made that he/she would not be allowed to use money . 483.420(a)(5) The facility is responsible to or ganize itself in such a manner to assure that individuals are free from serious and immediate threat to their physical and psychological health and safety . \"Threat\" as used in this guideline, is any condition [or] situation which could cause or result in severe, temporary or permanent injury or harm to the mental or physical condition of individuals, or their death. The term \"abuse\" refers to the ill-treatment, violation, revilement, malignment, exploitation and/or otherwise disregard of an individual, whether purposeful, or due to carelessness, inattentiveness, or omission of the perpetrator . Individuals must not be subjected to abuse by anyone (including but not limited to: facility staf f, consultants or volunteers, staf f of other agencies serving the individual, family members or legal guardians, friends, other individuals, themselves). The absence of adequate facility staf f supervision does not, in and of itself, pose the threat, but the resultant individual behaviors or lack of behaviors of staf f demonstrate that training issues confirm the pervasiveness and seriousness of the deficiency . \"Physical abuse\" refers to any physical motion or action, (e.g., hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, pinching, etc.) by which bodily harm or trauma occurs. It includes use of corporal punishment as well as the use of any restrictive, intrusive procedure to control inappropriate behavior for purpose of punishment. Observe individuals to see if they are bruised, cut, burned (cigarettes, etc.). \"V erbal abuse\" refers to any use of oral, written or gestured language by which abuse occurs. This includes pejorative and derogatory terms to describe persons with disabilities. \"Psychological abuse\" includes, but is not limited to, humiliation, harassment, and threats of punishment or deprivation, sexual coercion, intimidation, whereby individuals suf fer psychological harm or trauma. 483.420(a)(6) The chronic use of restraints may indicate one or more of the following: the individual' s developmental and/or behavioral needs are not being met and the appropriateness of placement should be questioned; staf f behavior may be prompting behaviors in individuals which result in the chronic use of physical restraints and drugs to control behavior; staf f may have inadequate training and/or experience Ch 64, p. 16 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 to provide active treatment and employ preventive measures that reduce the levels of behaviors judged to require physical restraints and drugs to control behavior; and restraints may be applied to behaviors which are, in fact, not threatening to the health and welfare of the individual or other individuals and staf f. 483.420(a)(7) The facility must examine and treat individuals in a manner that maintains the privacy of their bodies. Only authorized employees directly involved in the treatment are present when treatments are given. Some method or mechanism which ensures privacy (such as a closed door , a drawn curtain or systematically implemented training for an individual to use their own methods) must be employed to shield the individual from passers-by . People not involved in the care of the individual should not be present without their consent while they are being examined or treated. An individual must be granted privacy during toileting, bathing, and other activities of personal hygiene. If an individual requires assistance because of development or physical deficit, authorized staf f should assist giving utmost attention to the individual' s need for privacy . The facility must have a method of arranging for privacy of visits between individuals with significant relationships, if they do not both reside at the facility . Exercise special attention to ensure that ... [the department] behavior , during onsite observations in the individual' s home, does not violate an individual' s right to privacy during treatment and care of personal needs. 483.420(a)(8) \"W ork,\" as used in the regulation, is defined to mean any directed activity , or series of related activities which results in benefit to the economy of the facility or in a contribution to its maintenance, or in the production of a salable product. In deciding whether a particular activity constitutes \"work\" as defined above, the key determinant is if an individual was unavailable to perform the particular activity or function, would the facility be required to hire additional full or part-time staf f (or pay overtime to existing staf f) in order to properly maintain the facility or to provide necessary care services to individuals, in order to carry out its assigned mission? Individuals are not to be used to provide a source of labor for a facility against their will or in opposition to the objectives of the IPP . Seriously question any situation in which an individual is observed or reported to be \"volunteering\" to do real work that benefits the facility , or its maintenance without compensation. Interview such individuals to determine if they have given informed consent to such practices and understand that by providing employable services they are able to be compensated. This does not preclude an individual from helping out a friend or being kind to others. Self-care activities related to the care of one' s own person are not considered \"work\" for the purposes of compensation. Regular participation in the domiciliary activities of maintaining one' s own immediate household or residential living unit which can lead to the individual' s greater functional ability to perform independent household tasks is also not considered \"work\" for the facility . Shared duties are common and appropriate. Included in, but not limited to, these domiciliary tasks are: Meal planning, food purchasing, food preparation, table setting, serving, dishwashing, etc.; Household cleaning, laundry; Clothes repair; Light yard and house maintenance (painting, simple carpentry , etc.); General household shopping, including clothing. In general, participation in any household tasks which promotes greater independent functioning (and which the individual has not yet learned) is permitted as long as tasks are included in the IPP in written behavioral and measureable terms. This participation must be supervised, and indices of performance should be available. No task may be performed for the convenience of staf f (e.g., supervising individuals, running personal errands) or which has no relationship to the individual' s IPP . As individuals become competent and independent in household tasks, they must not be used in those capacities and represented as \"in training\" and serious consideration should be given to the individual' s potential for even less restrictive residential environments. (See also \u00a7483.440(a)(2) and (b)(1)). However , it is acceptable for individuals to engage in household tasks which are in common IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 17 with other individuals, all sharing the total household tasks commonly shared in nuclear family units. The test in this regard is: The expectation is that tasks are the general responsibility of the individual, and that the duties rotate to the maximum extent possible; and/or The individual can assume control in performing the responsibility given (e.g., John has until Thursday at 8 p.m.to clean the living and dining rooms), thereby adding to the development of internal controls and assumption of responsibility by individuals. W ork performed by the individual which no other individual is required or expected to do, or is not a regular part of running the household, must be compensated. \"Compensated\" is defined to mean the receipt of money or other forms of negotiable compensation for work (including work performed in an occupational training program) which is available to the individual, to be used at his or her discretion in determining the benefits to be derived therefrom. \"Prevailing wage\" refers to the wage paid to non-disabled workers in nearby industry or the surrounding community for essentially the same type, quality and quantity of work or work requiring comparable skills. A working individual must be paid at least the prevailing minimum wage except when an appropriate certificate has been obtained by the facility in accordance with current regulations and guidelines issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended. Any individual performing work as defined above, must be compensated in direct proportion to his or her productivity as measured in work equivalents of a regular employee' s output. For example, if an individual' s productivity for a particular work activity or function is determined to be 30% of normal output for an average non-disabled worker , and the prevailing wage is $4.00 an hour , then the individual should be compensated in money at a rate of one dollar and twenty cents per hour (.30 x $4.00 = $1.20). If a piece rate can be determined for a particular job, an individual is paid based on the number of pieces he or she produces. An individual' s pay is not dependent on the production of other individuals when she or he works in a group. When the individual' s active treatment program includes assignment to occupational or vocational training or work, specific work objectives of anticipated progress should be included in the IPP along with reasons for the assignments. If the training of individuals on particular occupational activities or functions involves \"real work\" to be accomplished for the facility , the individuals must be compensated based on ability . For example, if in the process of work training activities involved with learning to clean a floor , the floor for a particular building is cleaned and does not require further janitorial cleanup, then the individual must be compensated for this activity . 483.420(a)(9) Space must be provided for individuals to receive visitors in reasonable comfort and privacy . Assistance shall be provided to individuals who require help in reading or sending mail. 483.420(a)(1 1) Outdoor and out of home activities are planned for all individuals on a regular basis. 483.420(a)(12) All individual possessions regardless of their apparent value to others must be treated with respect, for what they are and for what they may represent to the individual. The facility should encourage individuals to use or display possessions of his or her choice in a culturally normative manner . Appropriate personal possessions include personal care and hygiene items. Individuals should not be without personal possessions because of the behavior of others with whom they live. If a method for identifying personal ef fects is used, it should be inconspicuous and in a manner that will assist the individual to identify them. \"Appropriate\" clothing means a supply of clothing that is suf ficient, in good repair , accounts for a variety of occasions and seasons, and appropriate to age, size, gender , and level of activity . Modification or adaptation of clothing fasteners should be considered based on the needs of an individual with a physical disability to be independent. As appropriate, each individual' s active treatment program maximizes opportunities for choice and self-direction with regard to choosing and shopping for clothing which enhances his or her appearance, and selecting daily clothing in accordance with age, sex and cultural norms. Ch 64, p. 18 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 Individuals are permitted to keep personal clothing and possessions for their use while in the facility . Determine how the facility both ensures the safety of personal possessions while at the same time providing access to them when the individual chooses. 483.420(b)(1)(i) A \"full and complete accounting for personal funds\" does not need to document accounting for incidental expenses or \"pocket money ,\" funds a capable individual handles without assistance, funds dispensed to an individual under a program to train the individual in money management, and funds that are not entrusted to the facility (e.g., funds paid directly to the individual' s representative payee). 483.420(b)(1)(ii) Although prudent to do so, there is no Federal requirement to maintain individual' s personal funds in financial institutions in interest bearing accounts, or in accounts separate from other individual accounts. However , if the facility elects to pool individual' s funds in an interest bearing account, including common trust accounts, it is expected to know the interest separately accrued by each individual, as part of its required accounting of funds. Interest accumulated to an individual' s account belongs to the individual, not the facility . 483.420(b)(2) Parents or other family members should not have automatic access to the financial records of adult individuals. It is not necessary that a facility be required to furnish an annual financial statement to the individual or the individual' s family , since the facility is already required to make the financial record available at any time upon request. The individual, in turn, is free to choose to make his or her financial record available to anyone else. 483.420(c)(1) \"Unobtainable,\" as used in this standard, means that the facility has made a bona fide ef fort to seek parental or guardian participation in the process, even though the ef fort may ultimately be unsuccessful (for example, the parent may be impossible to locate or may prove unwilling or unable to participate). \"Inappropriate\" as used in this standard means that the parent or legal guardian' s behavior is so disruptive or uncooperative that others cannot ef fectively participate, the individual does not wish his or her parent to participate, and the individual is competent to make this decision, or there is strong evidence that the parent or guardian is not acting on the individual' s behalf or in the individual' s best interest. In the case of the latter , determine what the facility has done to ef fectively resolve the problem. 483.420(c)(2) Where possible, randomly select a family or guardian to validate the quality , nature and frequency of the communications between the facility and families or guardians (but only with their consent). 483.420(c)(3) Any limitations of visitors are recorded by the interdisciplinary team with reason and time limits given. Decisions to restrict a visitor must be reviewed and reevaluated each time the IPP is reviewed or at the individual' s request. If... [the department] find broad restrictions, review general facility access policies. The facility should have arrangements available to provide privacy for families, etc., when visiting with individuals. 483.420(c)(5) It is not acceptable for a facility to sponsor or allow individuals to take a particular type of trip that is contraindicated. For example, in the situation of an individual subject to abuse by a parent, the facility obviously is not required to permit such a trip. However , as with any right that may need to be modified or limited, the individual should be provided with the least restrictive and most appropriate alternative available. 483.420(c)(6) \"Significant\" incidents or changes in the individual' s condition refers to any type of occurrence or event, that is perceived to have some level of importance to the individual, family or guardian. Other examples include but are not limited to: allegations of mistreatment, psychological trauma experienced by the individual, loss or change of a program service or staf f person, entry or placement in new programs or agencies, day-to-day events on which family members express interest to be informed, etc. 483.420(d)(2) \"Mistreatment,\" as used in this standard, includes behavior or facility practices that result in any type of individual exploitation such as financial, sexual, or criminal. IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 19 Investigate any injuries of unknown origin and any allegation of mistreatment to an individual regardless of who is the perpetrator , for example: facility staf f, parents, legal guardians, volunteer staf f from outside agencies serving the individual, neighbors, or other individuals, etc. 483.420(d)(4) The particular mechanisms developed by a facility for investigation are at its discretion, provided that alleged violations of individual rights are thoroughly investigated and appropriate actions are taken. Appropriate corrective action is not defined within the context of these guidelines. Evaluate the facts of each situation and make a judgment about appropriateness. \"W orking days\" means Monday through Friday , excluding State and Federal holidays. 483.430(a) V iew the person serving the QMRP [Qualified Mental Retardation Professional] role as pivotal to a determination about the adequacy of the program the individual receives, since it is this role that is intended to ensure that the individual receives those services and interventions necessary by competent persons capable of delivering them. The paramount importance of having persons competent to judge and supervise active treatment issues cannot be overstated. An individual' s IPP may be coordinated and monitored by more than one QMRP . However , there must be one QMRP who is assigned primary responsibility for coordinating the individual' s IPP . Since the regulations do not specify if a person designated as a QMRP must do the duties of a QMRP exclusively , or is allowed to perform other professional staf f duties in addition, the facility has the flexibility to allocate staf f resources in whatever manner it believes is necessary as long as it ensures that the QMRP function is performed ef fectively for each individual. The test of whether the number of QMRPs is adequate rests with the ability of the facility to provide the services described in \u00a7483.430(a)(1) in an ef fective manner . The number will vary depending on such factors as: the number of individuals it serves, the complexity of needs manifested by these individuals, the number , qualifications and competencies of additional professional staf f members, and whether or not other duties are assigned to the QMRP function. Other staf f persons can perform the duties of the QMRP , but the QMRP must sign for , and is responsible and accountable for the QMRP function. The QMRP is responsible for serving as the primary advocate for the individual and for ensuring that monitoring functions are completed appropriately . 483.430(a)(1) \"Experience\" means providing professional services in a setting that serves persons with mental retardation. 483.430(b)(1) For an active treatment program to be responsive to the individual' s unique needs, there must be a foundation of competent professional knowledge that can be drawn upon in the implementation of the interdisciplinary team process. Individuals with developmental deficits will require initial, temporary , or ongoing services from professional staf f, knowledgeable about contemporary care practices associated with these areas. A special mention needs to be made that care be taken not to provide individuals with services that are n o t needed (e.g., if an individual is basically healthy and not on medication, then the individual should not be loaded up with health and health related services). The needs identified in the initial comprehensive functional assessment, as required in \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v), should guide the team in deciding if a particular professional' s further involvement is necessary and, if so, to what extent professional involvement must continue on a direct or indirect basis. Since such needed professional expertise may fall within the purview of multiple professional disciplines, based on overlapping training and experience, determine if the facility' s delivery of professional services is adequate by the extent to which individual' s needs are aggressively and competently addressed. Some examples in which professional expertise may overlap include: P h y s i c a l d e v e l o p m e n t a n d h e a l t h \u2014 nurse (routine medical or nursing care needs that do not interfere with participation in other programs); physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner (acute major medical intervention, or the treatment of chronic medical needs which will be dependent upon an individual' s success or failure in other treatment programs). Ch 64, p. 20 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 N u t r i t i o n a l s t a t u s \u2014 nurse (routine nutritional needs that do not af fect participation in other programs); nutritionist or dietitian (chronic health problems related to nutritional deficiencies, modified or special diets). S e n s o r i m o t o r d e v e l o p m e n t : physical educators, adaptive physical educators, recreation therapists, (routine motor needs involving varying degrees of physical fitness or dexterity); special educators or other visual impairment specialists (specialized mobility training and orientation needs); occupational therapist, physical therapist, psysiatrist (specialized fine and gross motor needs caused by muscular , neuromuscular , or physical limitations, and which may require the therapeutic use of adaptive equipment or adapted augmentative communication devices to increase functional independence); dietitians to increase specialized fine and gross motor skills in eating. A f f e c t i v e ( E m o t i o n a l ) d e v e l o p m e n t : special educators, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrist, mental health counselors, rehabilitation counselors, behavior therapists, behavior management specialists. S p e e c h a n d l a n g u a g e ( c o m m u n i c a t i o n ) d e v e l o p m e n t : speech-language pathologists, special educators for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. A u d i t o r y f u n c t i o n i n g : audiologists (basic or comprehensive audiologic assessment and use of amplification equipment); speech-language pathologists (like audiologists, may perform aural rehabilitation); special educators for individuals who are hearing impaired. C o g n i t i v e d e v e l o p m e n t : teacher (if required by law , i.e., school aged children, or if pursuit of GED is indicated), psychologist, speech-language pathologist. V o c a t i o n a l d e v e l o p m e n t : vocational educators, occupational educators, occupational therapists, vocational rehabilitation counselors, or other work specialists (if development of specific vocational skills or work placement is indicated). S o c i a l d e v e l o p m e n t : teachers, professional recreation staf f, social workers, psychologists (specialized training needs for social skills development). A d a p t i v e b e h a v i o r s o r i n d e p e n d e n t l i v i n g s k i l l s . Special educators, occupational therapists. There are some individuals in ICFs/MR who can often have their needs ef fectively met without having direct contact with professional staf f on a daily basis. The intent of the requirement is not to require that professionals work directly with individuals on a daily basis, but only as often as an individual' s needs indicate that professional contact is necessary . The amount and degree of direct care that professionals must provide will depend on the needs of the individual and the ability of other staf f to train and direct individuals on a day-to-day basis. 483.430(b)(2) If there is suf ficient evidence that para- and non-professional staf f demonstrate the needed competencies to carry through with intervention strategies,.... [the department] may be satisfied there is suf ficient professional staf f to carry out the active treatment program. However , if the professionals' expertise is not demonstrable at the para- and non-professional staf f level, question both the numbers of professional staf f and the ef fectiveness of the para- and non-professional staf f. 483.430(b)(3) \"Participate\" means providing input through whatever means is necessary to ensure that the individual' s IPP is responsive to the individual' s needs. The purpose of the interdisciplinary team process is to provide team members with the opportunity to review and discuss information and recommendations relevant to the individual' s needs, and to reach decisions as a team rather than individually on who best to address those needs. Therefore, determine whether or not there is a pattern of active treatment based on professional participation in the process. 483.430(b)(4) \"Participate\" means both seeking out self-training and provision of training to others. 483.430(b)(5)(i)-(ix) The introductory phrase \"to be designated as \u2014\" means that a provider is allowed to represent him or herself as a professional provider in that discipline, only if the provider meets state licensing requirements, or if the particular discipline does not fall under State licensure requirements, the provider meets the qualifications specified in \u00a7483.430(b)(5)(i)-(ix). A person who is not qualified, for example, as a social worker , may not be referred to as a social worker per se; nevertheless, such a person may be able to provide social services in an ICF/MR if there is no conflict with State law , and as long as the individual' s needs are met. IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 21 483.430(b)(5)(ix) The Commission on Dietetic Accreditation of the American Dietetic Association is the or ganization to whom the American Dietetic Association delegates this responsibility . 483.430(b)(5)(x) The intent for including a \"human services professional\" category is to expand the number and types of persons who could qualify as QMRPs, while still maintaining acceptable professional standards. \"Human services field\" includes all the professional disciplines stipulated in \u00a7483.430(a)(3)(i)(ii) and \u00a7483.430(b)(5)(i)-(ix), as well as any related academic disciplines associated with the study of: human behavior (e.g., psychology , sociology , speech communication, gerontology etc.), human skill development (e.g., education, counseling, human development), humans and their cultural behavior (e.g., anthropology), or any other study of services related to basic human care needs (e.g., rehabilitation counseling), or the human condition (e.g., literature, the arts). An individual with a \"bachelors degree in a human services field\" means an individual who has received: a t l e a s t a bachelor ' s degree from a college or university (master and doctorate degrees are also acceptable) and has received academic credit for a coursework concentration in a human services field, as defined above. T aking into consideration a facility' s needs, the types of training and coursework that a person has completed, and the intent of the regulation, the facility and .... [the department] can exercise wide latitude of judgment to determine what constitutes an acceptable \"human services\" professional. Again, the key concern is the demonstrated competency to do the job. 483.430(c)(1) V olunteers may provide supplementary services. The facility may not rely on volunteers to fill required staf f positions and perform direct care services. Examine closely the adequacy of staf fing when individuals served are engaged in the care, training, treatment or supervision of other individuals, either as part of training, \"volunteer work,\" or normal daily routines (see W131-W132 for additional interpretation of productive work done as a \"volunteer\" or as part of the individual' s active treatment program). The test of adequacy is whether or not there is suf ficient staf f to accomplish the job in the absence of the individual' s work. W ork done as part of an active treatment training program requires that the staf f are monitoring and teaching new skills as part of the IPP . 483.430(c)(2) The test of adequacy about \"awake\" staf fing is how well the facility has or ganized itself to detect and react to potential emer gencies, such as fire, injuries, health emer gencies described in the medical care plan (e.g., aspiration, cardiac or respiratory failure, uncontrolled seizures) and behavioral crises described in the IPP . 483.430(c)(3) The intent of the regulation is that at all times a staf f person is in a position to help if individual needs arise. For purposes of this provision, \"on duty\" staf f need not be awake during normal bedtime hours. Facilities sending some or all of the individuals to out of home or of f grounds active treatment programs for a majority of the day need not provide a full complement of direct care staf f in the residence during their absence. However , a minimum of one staf f person must be on duty , if even one individual is present. 483.430(c)(4) \"Support staf f\" include all personnel hired by the facility that are not either direct care staf f or professional staf f. For example, support staf f include, but are not limited to: secretaries, clerks, housekeepers, maintenance and laundry personnel. Direct care staf f should be utilized at their highest level of competence, but they may assume other roles as long as their ability to exercise their primary direct care duties is not diluted. For example, a direct care staf f may serve as an aide in a training program during the hours individuals are away from the living unit. 483.430(d)(1) \"Suf ficient\" direct care staf f is defined to mean the number of staf f, over and above the ratios specified in \u00a7483.430(d)(3), necessary to implement active treatment, as dictated by the individual' s active treatment needs. Do not look at pure numbers alone. The facility is responsible to or ganize and evaluate its individual appointments, programming schedules, activities, materials, equipment, grouping assignments and available staf f in such a way that maximizes benefit to the individual. Ch 64, p. 22 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 During the course of the onsite survey ,... [the department] should be able to observe behavioral evidence of such or ganization. Evaluate this data in light of the success or failure observed relevant to providing active treatment, and come to a judgment about the adequacy of the facility' s staf fing. 483.430(d)(2) \"Direct care staf f\" are those personnel whose daily responsibility it is to manage, supervise and provide direct care to individuals, in their residential living units. This staf f could include professional staf f (e.g., registered nurses, social workers) or other support staf f, i f their primary assigned daily shift function is to provide management, supervision and direct care of individuals' daily needs (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding, toileting, recreation and reinforcement of active treatment objectives) in their living units. However , professional staf f who simply work with individuals in a living unit on a periodic basis cannot be included. Also supervisors of direct care staf f can be counted only if they share in the actual work of the direct care of individuals. Supervisors whose principal assigned function is to supervise other staf f, cannot be included. 483.430(d)(3) The minimum ratios in this standard indicate the m i n i m u m number of direct-care staf f that must be present and on duty , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , for each discrete living unit. It does not include anyone not functioning as direct care staf f. For example, to calculate the minimum number of living unit staf f that must be present and on duty in a discrete living unit serving 16 individuals with multiple disabilities: divide the number of individuals \"16\", by the number corresponding to the regulation \"3.2\", the result equals \"5\". Therefore, the facility must determine how many staf f it must hire to ensure that at least 5 staf f will be able to be present and on duty during the 24 hour period in which those individuals are present. \"Calculated over all shifts in a 24-hour period\" is defined to mean that there be present and on duty every day of the year: one direct-care staf f for each eight individuals on the first shift (1:8), one direct care staf f for each eight individuals on the second shift (1:8), and one direct care staf f for each 16 individuals on the third shift (1:16). Therefore, using the same living unit described above, there are present and on duty for each twenty-four hour day five (5) direct care staf f for each 16 individuals. The same calculations are made for the other ratios, whichever applies. Determine if absences of staf f for breaks and meals results in a pattern of prolonged periods in which present and on-duty staf f do not meet the ratios. 483.430(e)(2) V iew inservice training as a dynamic growth process. It is predicated on the view that all levels of staf f can share competencies which enable the individual to benefit from the consistent, wide-spread application of the interventions required by the individual' s particular needs. In the final analysis, the adequacy of the inservice training program is measured in the demonstrated competencies of all levels of staf f relevant to the individual' s unique needs as well as in terms of the \"af fective\" characteristics of the caregivers and the personal quality of their relationships with the individuals. Observe the staf f ' s knowledge by observing the outcomes of good transdisciplinary staf f development (i.e., in the principles of active treatment) in such recommended competencies as: Respect, dignity , and positive regard for individuals (e.g., how staf f refers to individuals, refer to W127). Use of behavioral principles in training interactions between staf f and individuals. Use of developmental programming principles and techniques, e.g., functional training techniques, task analysis, and ef fective data keeping procedures. Use of accurate procedures regarding abuse detection and prevention, restraints, medications, individual safety , emer gencies, etc. Use of adaptive mobility and augmentative communication devices and systems to help individuals achieve independence in basic self-help skills. Use of positive behavior intervention programming. 483.430(e)(4) Observe whether or not staf f are competent and knowledgeable about the needs, programs and progress of each individual with whom they are assigned to work. Staf f should be able to demonstrate in practice the results of training for the individuals for whom they are responsible to work. 483.440(a)(1) \"Continuous\" is defined to mean the competent interaction of staf f with individuals served at all times, in formal and informal settings, in the service of ef fective relationships in general between staf f and individuals served, and the implementation of specific IPP objectives, in particular . IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 23 V erify that active treatment is identifiable during formal and informal interactions between staf f and individuals served. The performance of the individual should reflect the success, if any , of interventions being applied or the need to alter the intervention procedures. Although the active treatment p r o c e s s must be identifiable in documentation, it must be o b s e r v a b l e in daily practice. Determine h o w the ICF/MR accomplishes (or fails to accomplish) an environment of competence that enables active treatment to occur . The ICF/MR ensures that each individual receives active treatment daily regardless of whether or not an outside resource(s) is used for programming (e.g., public school, day habilitation center , senior day services program, sheltered workshop, supported employment. 483.440(a)(1)(ii) Those \"active\" interventions necessary to prevent or decelerate regression are considered to be part of the overall active treatment program. For example, if the application of a specific stimulation technique to the area of the mouth of an individual with severe physical and medical disabilities, decelerates the individual' s rate of reliance on tube feedings, and helps the individual retain ability to take food by mouth, then this intervention is considered to be a component of active treatment for the individual. Additionally , active treatment for elderly individuals may increasingly need to focus on interventions and activities which promote physical wellness and fitness, socialization and tasks that stress maintaining coordination skills and reducing the rate of loss of skills that accompanies the physical aspects of the aging process. Be sensitive to the total life span context when reviewing elderly individual' s unique needs. 483.440(a)(2) The presence of a n y group of individuals (court-ordered or not) could call into question the overall nature of the services provided by the ICF/MR. Individuals displaying some or all of the characteristics described in the Interpretive Guideline at \u00a7483.440(b)(1), do not \"need active treatment services\" or ICF/MR level of care, and are not appropriately placed. Although the facility may be providing services to meet the needs of these types of individuals, the services provided by the facility do not meet the statutory and regulatory definition of \"active treatment.\" Furthermore, if the primary purpose of the facility is no longer to provide services to persons with mental retardation or related conditions who are in need of active treatment, the facility no longer meets the statutory (\u00a71905(d) of the Social Security Act) and regulatory definition of an ICF/MR, and cannot be certified. If... [the department] determine that an individual engages in productive work which benefits the facility , on a routine basis, and the work i s done at an appropriate level of independence (i.e., n o t done as part of an or ganized work training program to teach the individual n e w skills), question the need for the facility to continue to provide active treatment services for the individual, especially if the individual is fully functional in that job. This is especially important as ... [the department] consider the adequacy of the staf f and whether or not individuals are working in place of staf f. There are some individuals who need the help of an ICF/MR to continue to function independently because they have learned to depend upon the programmatic structure it provides. The fact that they are n o t y e t independent, even though they can be, makes it appropriate for them to receive active treatment services directed at achieving needed and possible independence. 483.440(b)(1) Individuals with the following characteristics do not necessarily require a continuous active treatment program in order to function or to achieve optimal independence. Review closely to what extent the ICF/MR serves individuals, who in the aggregate: Are independent without aggressive and consistent training; Are usually able to apply skills learned in training situations to other settings and environments; Are generally able to take care of most of their personal care needs, make known to others their basic needs and wants, and understand simple commands; Are capable of working at a competitive wage level without support, and to some extent, are able to engage appropriately in social interactions; Are able usually , to conduct themselves appropriately when allowed to have time away from the facility' s premises; and Do not require the range of professional services or interventions in order to make progress. Ch 64, p. 24 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 Based on the order of a court, the ICF/MR may be required to admit individuals who do not need active treatment. Although HCF A has no jurisdiction to prevent the courts from ordering the placements of such individuals in ICFs/MR, they , by definition, would be ineligible to be classified by Medicaid for the ICF/MR benefit. T o the extent that the placement of these court-ordered individuals does not interfere with the ability of the ICF/MR to provide active treatment for its individuals, the facility' s certification is not af fected. 483.440(b)(2) No admission should be regarded as permanent. Readmission of an individual to the ICF/MR falls under the same requirements relative to admission. In the absence of State regulations designating the person(s) authorized to approve admission (e.g., State or Regional Admissions Committees), the decision to admit an individual to the ICF/MR is based on the findings of an interdisciplinary team, including a QMRP . Occasionally , emer gency admissions of individuals may occur without benefit of a preliminary evaluation having been conducted p r i o r t o a d m i s s i o n . For purposes of \u00a7483.440(b)(2) and consistent with \u00a7456.370(a), this requirement will be considered as \"met\" at such time that an evaluation is conducted which supports the need for an individual' s placement in the ICF/MR. Refer to W210. 483.440(b)(4)(i) \"T ransfer\" means the temporary movement of an individual between facilities or the permanent movement of an individual between living units of the same facility . \"Dischar ge\" means the permanent movement of an individual to another residence that is not under the jurisdiction of the facility' s governing body . Moving an individual for \"good cause\" means for any reason that is in the best interest of the individual. The family and the individual should be involved in any decision to move an individual, since this decision generally , should be part of a team process that includes the individual or guardian. If an individual has an advocate, the advocate should participate in the decision making process. 483.440(c)(1) There is no \"current\" number of individuals who comprise the interdisciplinary team. The facility must make every ef fort to coordinate the IEP [Individual Education Plan] (if any) with the IPP process. This may result (but is not required) in a single IPP/IEP document. 483.440(c)(2) Meetings should be scheduled and conducted to facilitate the participation of all members of the team, but e s p e c i a l l y the individual, unless he or she is clearly unable or unwilling, as should the individual' s parents (except in the case of a competent adult who does not desire them to do so) or the individual' s guardian or legal representative. The ICF/MR is expected to pursue aggressively the attendance of all relevant participants at the team meeting, (e.g., a conference call with a consultant during deliberations meets this requirement). Question routine \"unscheduled\" absences by individuals, guardians and particular disciplines or consultants, and determine the impact on ef fectiveness and responsiveness of the IPP to meet the individual' s needs. 483.440(c)(3) \"Accurate\" assessments refer to assessment data that are current, relevant and valid, and that the skills, abilities and training needs identified by the assessment correspond to the individual' s actual status. Additionally , for assessment data to be accurate, the cultural background and experience of the individual must be reflected in the choice, administration and interpretation of the evaluation(s) used. A few examples of appropriate adaptions might be: specialized equipment, use of an interpreter , use of manual communication, tests designed to measure performance in the presence of visual disability . The active treatment assessment process should be sensitive to the behaviors of individuals throughout their life span. For example, infants and toddlers are expected to engage in more play-related, exploratory activities, adolescents are expected to engage in activities of increasingly greater responsibility in preparation for adulthood, adults are expected to support themselves or at least be engaged in training or education activities toward that end, and elderly citizens, are expected to choose whichever form of productive activity meets their needs and interests (employment, handiwork, pursuit of leisure, etc.) for as long as they are able. 483.440(c)(3)(i)\u2014(iv) In the presence of a diagnoses (medical or otherwise), evaluation data must be available to support the determination. The comprehensive functional assessment may be a report synthesizing the results of salient assessments or a series of reports. If individual reports are utilized, the complete diagnostic work-up or problem list identified by others is not required to be repeated unless it is relevant to the particular IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 25 assessment. Findings are recorded in terms that facilitate clear communication across disciplines. Diagnoses or imprecise terms and phrases (including, but ability\") in the absence of specific terms, are not acceptable. Assessment of the behavior assumed to be maladaptive should include analyses of the potential causes, such as: lack of exposure to positive models and teaching strategies, lack of ability to communicate needs and desires, lack of success experiences, a history of punishing experiences, or presence of a physiological condition. Specific \"developmental\" strengths and needs describe what the individual \"can\" and \"cannot do.\" In the presence of significant developmental deficit, it is not acceptable for the comprehensive evaluation to identify , merely , that a particular professional therapy or treatment is n o t needed. T o meet the requirement for \"need for service,\" the assessment must identify additionally the course of specific interventions recommended to meet the individual' s needs in lieu of direct professional therapy or treatment. 483.440(c)(3)(v) The facility must assess in developmental a r e a s , but n o t by professional disciplines unless the functional assessment shows a need for a full professional evaluation. Findings relative to the domains required under \u00a7483.440(c)(v) include, but are not limited to: 1. P h y s i c a l d e v e l o p m e n t a n d h e a l t h . Physical development includes the individual' s developmental history , results of the physical examination conducted by a licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner , health assessment data (including a medication and immunization history), which may be compiled by a nurse, and skills normally associated with the monitoring and supervision of one' s own health status, and administration and/or scheduling of one' s own medical treatments. When indicated by physical examination results, consultations by specialist are provided or obtained. 2. N u t r i t i o n a l s t a t u s . Nutritional status includes determination of appropriateness of diet, adequacy of total food intake, and the skills associated with: eating (including chewing, sucking and swallowing disorders), food service practices, and monitoring and supervision of one' s own nutritional status. 3. S e n s o r i m o t o r d e v e l o p m e n t : Sensory development includes the development of perceptual skills that are involved in observing the environment and making sense of it. Motor development includes those behaviors that primarily involve: muscular , neuromuscular , or physical skills and varying degrees of physical dexterity . Because sensory and motor development are intimately related, and because activities in these areas are functionally inseparable, attention to these two aspects of bodily activity is often combined in the concept of sensorimotor development. Assessment data identify the extent to which corrective, orthotic, prosthetic, or support devices would impact on functional status. 4. A f f e c t i v e ( E m o t i o n a l ) d e v e l o p m e n t : Af fective or emotional development includes the development of behaviors that relate to one' s interests, attitudes, values, and emotional expressions. 5. S p e e c h a n d l a n g u a g e ( c o m m u n i c a t i o n ) d e v e l o p m e n t : Communication development refers to the development of both verbal and nonverbal receptive and expressive communication skills. Assessment data identify the appropriate intervention strategy to be applied, and which, if any , augmentative or assistive devices will improve communication and functional status. 6. A u d i t o r y f u n c t i o n i n g . Auditory functioning refers to the extent to which a person can hear and to the maximum use of residual hearing if a hearing loss exists and whether or not the individual will benefit from the use of amplification, including a hearing aid or a program of amplification. An individual' s treatment might need to include being desensitized to tolerate the use of a hearing aid or assistive listening device to prevent the device from being rejected or destroyed. Assessment may include teaching techniques for conducting the assessment or the use of electrophysiologic techniques. 7. C o g n i t i v e d e v e l o p m e n t : Cognitive development refers to the development of those processes by which information received by the senses is stored, recovered, and used. It includes the development of the processes and abilities involved in memory , reasoning and problem solving. Ch 64, p. 26 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 8. S o c i a l d e v e l o p m e n t : Social development refers to the information of those self-help, recreation and leisure, and interpersonal skills that enable an individual to establish and maintain appropriate roles and fulfilling relationships with others. 9. A d a p t i v e b e h a v i o r s o r i n d e p e n d e n t l i v i n g s k i l l s . Adaptive behavior refers to the ef fectiveness or degree with which individuals meet the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of their age and cultural group. Independent living skills include, but are not limited to such things as meal preparation, doing laundry , bedmaking, and budgeting. Assessment may be performed by anyone trained to do so. Standardized tests are not required. Standardized adaptive behavior scales which identify all or predominantly all \"developmental needs\" are not suf ficient enough to meet this requirement, but can serve as a basis for screening. 10. V o c a t i o n a l ( p r e v o c a t i o n a l ) d e v e l o p m e n t , \" a s a p p l i c a b l e \" . V ocational development refers to work interests, work skills, work attitudes, work-related behaviors, and present and future employment options. The determination of whether or not a vocational assessment is \"applicable\" is typically based on age (adolescents or adults more than likely require this type of assessment). 483.440(c)(4) The presence of a comprehensive list of behaviorally stated strengths and needs is acceptable for this portion of the requirement. \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(i)\u2014(v) regulate requirements for IPP t r a i n i n g objectives (as opposed to staf f or service objectives). 483.440(c)(4)(i) \"Single\" behavior outcomes means for each, discrete, behavior that the team intends for the individual to learn, a separate objective is assigned. (For example, \"Mary will bake a cake and clean the oven\" are two separate behaviors and therefore should be stated in two separate objectives). 483.440(c)(4)(ii) The \"projected date of completion\" for an IPP objective is not the same as a \"review\" date. For each objective assigned priority , the team should assign a projected date by which it believes the individual will have learned the new skill, based on all the assessment data. This date triggers the team to evaluate continuously whether or not the individual' s progress or learning curve is suf ficient to warrant a revision to the training program. 483.440(c)(4)(iii) \"Behavioral\" terms include only those behaviors which are \"individual\" rather than \"staf f\" oriented and those that any person would agree can be seen or heard. Determine if all staf f who work with the individual can define the exact same outcome on which to measure the individual' s performance. \"Measurable indices of performance\" are the quantifiable criteria to use in determining successful achievement of the objective. Criteria include various measurements of intensity and duration. For example \"M. will walk t e n f e e t , with her tripod walker , f o r 5 c o n s e c u t i v e d a y s .\" 483.440(c)(4)(iv) T o or ganize the objectives into a planned developmental sequence the ICF/MR must consider the outcomes it projects the individual will be able to accomplish in the long term. Interview staf f to discover the purpose to be achieved upon completion of the objective. 483.440(c)(4)(v) After all the objectives have been established, the IPP identifies those objectives which the team considers to be most important, or which need to be implemented before others can be accomplished, and then assigns them priority . Some examples of assigning priority include but are not limited to: rank ordering (most important to least important), assignment of \"priority\" or \"non-priority\", etc. 483.440(c)(5)(iii) The \"person\" designated to be \"responsible for the program\" may or may not be the same person who implements the program. 483.440(c)(5)(iv) Data collection is evidence of individual performance and should be taken constantly as evidence for ... [the department] that \"treatments\" occurred. Methods of data collection on IPP training programs should be based on the total (including direct care) facility' s staf f analysis and observations of an individual' s behavior . Examples of a few data collection systems include, but are not limited to: level of prompt, successful trials completed out of opportunities given, frequency counts, frequency sampling, etc. The facility should collect data with enough frequency and enough content that it can measure appropriately the individual' s performance toward the tar geted IPP objective. 483.440(c)(6)(iii) \"Developmental incapability\" is a decision to be made by the interdisciplinary team based on its assessment of the individual' s development strengths and needs. For example, there is ample evidence that even individuals with the most severe physical and mental disabilities can be toilet trained. Recognization is given to the fact that some individuals however , have insuf ficient sensory and IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 27 neuromuscular control ever to be totally independent in toileting skills. For most of this group, there are intermediate steps which can be achieved, including toilet scheduling, in which the individual is able to be trained to a schedule of elimination with needed assistance from staf f. The intent of the toileting part of this regulation is met if there is evidence that the individual has been provided an aggressive, well or ganized, and well executed toilet training program in the past a n d that the team determines the individual' s \"developmental incapability .\" 483.440(c)(6)(iv) Mechanical devices used to support an individual' s proper body position or alignment may be essential to prevent contractures and deformities, but the staf f should be sensitive to the fact that mechanical supports may restrict movement and the individual should not be in the supports all the time or as a substitute for programs or therapy which may reduce the dependency on the support. Some supports allow movement and provide opportunity for more increased functioning. Just because mechanical supports are needed for an individual, does not always make their application over time appropriate or helpful. 483.440(c)(6)(v) W ith the exception of those individuals who are acutely ill (such as those who are hospitalized or incapacitated by a short term illness), all individuals should be out of bed and outside their bedroom area as long as possible each day , and in p r o p e r body alignment at all times. This is a necessity in order to prevent regression, contractures, and deformities and to provide sensory stimulation, etc. Question patterns of bed rest \"orders\" or \"scheduled\" bed rest as a routine part of an individual' s program. A nap period of an hour , for example, is not \"bed rest.\" However , if the ICF/MR, as a general pattern of scheduling, expects an individual to be one-two hours in bed in the morning, one-two hours in bed in the afternoon, and an 8:00 p.m. bedtime in the evening, for example, then the practice b e c o m e s \"bed rest,\" and the intent of the regulation will more than likely n o t be met. Question seriously lar ge amounts of time during which an individual is confined to bed. 483.440(c)(6)(vi) Due to the basic underlying importance \"choice\" plays in the quality of one' s life, the ICF/MR should maximize daily activities for its individuals in such a way that varying degrees of decision-making can be practiced as skills are acquired. Examples of some activities leading toward responsibility for one' s own self-management include, but are not limited to: choosing housing or roommates, choosing clothing to purchase or wear , choosing what to eat, making and keeping appointments, and interacting as an adult with those who provide services or assistance. Interview staf f to determine how attitudes and activities of the team and consultants facilitate or impede individual growth. 483.440(d)(1) A facility should not delay implementation of active treatment because the written document identifying the contents of the IPP has not been completed. For an individual newly admitted to the ICF/MR, the time period between admission and the 30 day interdisciplinary team meeting should be primarily for the purpose of assisting the individual to become adjusted and acclimated to his or her new living environment. In order to be able to produce the comprehensive assessment, the facility must evaluate the individual' s status in as many naturally occurring, functional environments as possible. It must be clear to ... [the department] that the active treatment program received by the individual is internally consistent and not simply a series of disconnected formal intervention applications within certain scheduled intervals. The criteria of what constitutes a \" s u f fi c i e n t number and frequency of interventions\" are based on the individual' s assessment and the progress the individual makes toward achieving IPP objectives. Whether \"structure\" must be imposed by staf f or whether the individual can direct his or her own activities for a period of time (without direct staf f observation), is based on the individual' s ability to engage in constructive, age-appropriate, adaptive behavior (without engaging in maladaptive behavior to self or others). Be certain that an individual' s time in the home or living unit is maximized toward the further development and refinement (including self-initiation) of appropriate skills, including but not limited to leisure and recreation. For the active treatment process to be ef fective, the overall pattern of interaction between staf f and individuals must be accountable to the comprehensive functional assessment and the IPP process. During the overall observation of individuals,... [the department] should be able to track that: the individual' s Ch 64, p. 28 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 comprehensive assessment identified the specific developmental need or strength justifying the activity , technique or interaction; in the case of a \"need,\" the team projected a measurable objective or tar get to address it; and the technique, interaction, or activity which is observed, produced the desired tar get, produced a close approximation of the tar get, or was modified based on the individual' s response. 483.440(d)(2) The active treatment schedule directs the intensity of the daily work of the staf f and the individuals in implementation of the IPP . T o the extent possible, the schedule of active treatment allows for the flexible participation of the individual in a broad range of options, rather than on a fixed regimen. Thus, individuals should have opportunities to choose activities and to engage in them as independently and freely as possible. Staf f routines and schedules should be supportive of this goal and result in the presence of reasonable choices by individuals. Investigate any pattern of staf f action or scheduling which results routinely in a l l or the m a j o r i t y of individuals engaging in the same activity or routine at the same time. For example, everyone is out of bed, awake and dressed before staf f on the third shift go home, or everyone goes to bed before the third shift arrives. 483.440(d)(3) The facility is responsible for ensuring that during staf f time spent with individuals, the staf f member is able to provide needed interventions or reinforce acquired skills in accordance with the IPP . This is one of the ways the ICF/MR implements c o n t i n u o u s active treatment. \"All\" staf f includes direct care staf f. The activities of the ICF/MR are coordinated with other habilitative and training activities in which the individual may participate outside of the ICF/MR, and vice versa. 483.440(e)(1) \"Data\" are defined to be performance information collected and reported in numerical or quantifiable form on training objectives assigned priority in the IPP . Data are those performance measurements recorded at the time the treatment, procedure, intervention or interaction occurs with the individual. They should be located in a place accessible to staf f who conduct training. The ICF/MR determines the type of data it wishes to collect, as long as the data are relevant to accurate measurement of the criteria stated in the individual' s IPP objectives. For example, if the criteria in the individual' s IPP objective specified some behavior to be measured by \"accuracy ,\" or \"successes out of opportunities,\" then it would not be acceptable for data measurements to reflect \"level of prompt\". Data must be accurate, i.e., data should correspond to the individual' s actual performance. 483.440(e)(2) See \u00a7483.410(c) Client Records. 483.440(f)(1)(i)\u2014(iv) The interval within which IPP reviews are conducted is determined by the facility , however the facility' s review system must be suf ficiently responsive to ensure that the IPP is reviewed w h e n e v e r the conditions specified in \u00a7483.440(f)(1)(i\u2014iii) occur . As the designated responsible agent, the QMRP must see that necessary revisions occur to the IPP . All team members must be knowledgeable of these changes. Information relevant to IPP changes should be recorded a s changes occur . 483.440(f)(2) Systematic behaviorally stated data become part of the comprehensive functional evaluation of the individual. Look for IPPs that are unchanged from one year to the next, for priority skills and behaviors that are deferred or ignored for one reason or the other , and for informal, vague, and programmatically worthless statements in the review (such as \"John did better this year\u2014he wasn' t as upset most of the time like he used to be.) If the ICF/MR has not been providing the individual with a systematic, behaviorally oriented active treatment program during the year , the review will be incapable of making systematic, behaviorally oriented statements about progress and change. If...[the department] finds problem behaviors which do not decrease significantly , relatively frequent usage of restraint or other intrusive restrictive procedures, a \"plateauing\" (e.g., reaches partial desired performance but does not improve over time and staf f does not reassess) of skills development, or any other signs of \"sameness\" year after year , questions should be raised about the extent to which the ICF/MR is providing active treatment, the adequacy of IPPs, staf f training, etc. particularly , if many individuals' annual reviews reveal these characteristics. For the \"annual\" review to meet the requirement, it must be completed by at least the 365th day after the last review . IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 29 483.440(f)(3) Depending on its size, complexity and available resources, the ICF/MR may establish one multi-purpose committee to serve it for a l l advisory functions, or it may establish separate single-purpose committees. The facility' s human rights committee may be shared among other agencies or the ICF/MR may utilize a human rights committee established by another governing body , e.g., a county or a statewide group, as long as all pertinent regulatory requirements are met. 483.440(f)(3)(ii) Informed consent implies that the person who is to give consent is c o m p e t e n t to evaluate the decision requiring consent (i.e., is able to evaluate the risks and alternatives of the treatment, program or proposal). For children up to the age of 18 the parent (natural guardian) or legally appointed guardian must give consent for him or her . At the age of 18, however , children become adults and are assumed to be competent unless otherwise determined by a court. For individuals who are minors or who are clearly incompetent but have no appointed legal guardian, informed consent for the use of restrictive programs, practices or procedures must be obtained from the legal guardian, parent or someone or some agency designated by the State, in accordance with State law , to act as the representative of the individual' s interests. Become familiar with the statutes of the State in which the ICF/MR is located to determine who or what mechanism is designated to give informed consent in such circumstances. V erify whether or not consent was obtained in accordance with law . Additionally , under these circumstances, the facility is required to identify those individuals, and expected to advocate for them by demonstrating continuing ef forts to obtain timely adjudication of the individual' s legal status. The committee must ensure that the informed and voluntary consent of the individual, parent of a minor , legal guardian, or the person or or ganization designated by the State is obtained prior to each of the following circumstances: the involvement of the individual in research activities, or implementation of programs or practices that could abridge or involve risks to individual protections or rights. Informed consent should be specific, separate (\"blanket\" consents are not allowed), and in writing. In case of unplanned events requiring immediate action, verbal consent may be obtained, however , it should be authenticated in writing as soon as reasonably possible. 483.440(f)(3)(iii) Examples of individual rights issues that might be reviewed by the committee, in addition to behavior management, include but are not limited to: research proposals involving individuals, abuse, neglect and mistreatment of individuals, allegations dealing with theft of an individual' s personal property or funds, damage to an individual' s goods or denial of other individual rights, individual grievances, visitation procedures. 483.450(a)(1) \"Conduct between staf f and clients\" refers to the language, actions, discipline, rules, order , and other types of interactions exchanged between staf f and individuals or imposed upon individuals by staf f during an individual' s daily experiences and which af fect the quality of an individual' s life. 483.450(a)(1)(i)\u2014(ii) See W125 for additional information on proactive assertion of an individual' s right to learn to exercise his or her rights. 483.450(a)(1)(iii) \"Client conduct\" refers to any behavior , choice, action, or activity in which an individual may choose to engage alone or with others. The policy or \"house rules\" include(s), for example: allowable individual conduct (e.g., swearing or cursing, freedom of choice in religion, consumption of alcohol, smoking, sexual relations), reasonable locations where this conduct may and may not occur , and parameters for decision-making when an individual' s choice conflicts with the group' s choice (e.g., consensus, voting, taking turns, negotiation of dif ferences). \"House rules\" on the other hand, may not authorize staf f to use a \"laundry list\" of discipline techniques to control an individual' s inappropriate behavior , without regard to individualized need. If it is determined that staf f must use a technique or intervention, then its use must be incorporated into an IPP program that meets all applicable requirements specified in \u00a7483.450(b)-(e). Refer to W123. 483.450(b)(1) Use of items, procedures, or systems which are potentially stigmatizing to the individual or otherwise would represent a substantial departure from the behavior of comparable peers without disabilities, in order to control or prevent inappropriate behavior , falls under this requirement as well. (For example, requiring an individual to live in a locked residence and not providing the individual with a key , using a high crib with bedrails, for an adult who gets out of bed at night and wanders or upsets other Ch 64, p. 30 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 individuals, requiring an individual who strips of f his clothes at inappropriate times to wear a jumpsuit turned backwards, or other odd usages of fashion.) 483.450(b)(1)(ii) Determine through observation and interview whether or not the overall emphasis on positive techniques is a t l e a s t a s extensive as on restrictive techniques. 483.450(b)(1)(iii) Y ou should see clear evidence to justify the use of a more restrictive technique. This requirement does not take away the team' s discretion to use technology which represents reasonable standards of good practice, but it does require that there be evidence that justifies any decision not to use a less restrictive technique first. 483.450(b)(1)(iv) \"T ime-out rooms\" is defined as the use of a room to implement a clinical procedure by which an individual is removed from positive reinforcement contingent upon the exhibition of a maladaptive behavior , until appropriate or adaptive behavior is exhibited. See also \u00a7483-450(c). \"Physical restraint\" is defined to be any manual method or physical or mechanical device that the individual cannot remove easily , and which restricts the free movement of, normal functioning of, or normal access to a portion or portions of an individual' s body . Examples of manual methods include therapeutic or basket holds and prone or supine containment. Examples of mechanical devices include arm splints, posey mittens, straight jackets. Excluded are physical guidance and prompting techniques of brief duration and mechanical supports as defined in \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) GUIDELINES to position or support an individual. See also \u00a7483.450(d). \"Drugs to manage inappropriate behavior\" is defined to be medications prescribed and administered for the purpose of modifying the maladaptive behavior of an individual. See also \u00a7483.450(e). \"Application of painful or noxious stimuli\" is defined as a clinical procedure by which staf f apply , contingent upon the exhibition of maladaptive behavior , startling, unpleasant, or painful stimuli, or stimuli that have a potentially noxious ef fect. The application of painful or noxious stimuli is used as a last resort and only when documentation shows that the implementation of consistent positive reinforcement methods have failed and that to withhold the procedure would cause irreparable harm to the health of the individual or others. Discomfort to the client should not extend beyond the point of application of the stimuli. There must be continuous monitoring while the procedure is in ef fect. The procedure must not result in physical or mental harm to the health and safety of the client. As interventions become more restrictive, the specificity with which they must be explained increases as does the intensity of the control established by the facility . This includes other techniques having similar degrees of intrusiveness to those defined above, such as positive practice and overcorrection training of extended duration and satiation. 483.450(b)(5) Ongoing authorization for \"programs\" or \"programmatic usages\" of restrictive techniques, in the absence of evidence to justify such usage, constitutes a \"standing\" or \"as needed program\" to control inappropriate behavior , and are therefore not permitted. 483.450(c)(1) The use of time-out rooms is ef fective only if the individual does not like to be removed from an activity or from people. Look for patterns of frequent, lengthy time-out usage which often indicates that the environment is not reinforcing to the individual (i.e., the activities in and of themselves are not engaging, and/or the scheduled activities are potentially engaging yet the schedule is not implemented). If the individual who is in a time-out room engages in self-abuse, becomes incontinent or shows other signs of illness, staf f should intervene. V erify whether or not anyone standing or lying in any position, in any part of the time-out room can be seen. Key or latch locks are not devices or mechanisms which require constant physical pressure from a staf f member to keep a door shut, and are therefore not permitted by the regulations. Pressure sensitive mechanisms must allow staf f to enter the room at the moment the need arises. 483.450(d)(1)(ii) \"Emer gency measure\" is defined as use of the least restrictive procedures and for the briefest time necessary to control severely aggressive or destructive behaviors that place the individual or others in imminent danger when those behaviors reasonably could not have been anticipated, and only as they are necessary within the context of positive behavioral programming. Examine closely how frequently \"emer gency measures\" are employed. Repeated applications of such measures within IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 31 short intervals of time, without subsequent incorporation into a written active treatment program, as required by \u00a7483.440(c), raises serious questions about the individual' s receipt of active treatment and the individual' s right to be free from unnecessary restraint. 483.450(d)(2) The facility determines who may authorize use of emer gency restraints. 483.450(d)(4) The frequency of monitoring will vary according to the type and design of the device and the psychological and physical well-being of the individual. For example, an individual in four -point restraints might require constant monitoring while someone in soft mittens may require less frequent monitoring. It is also true that for some manipulative individuals, constant visual supervision would serve to reinforce the inappropriate behavior and thereby reduce the clinical ef fectiveness of using the restraint. \"As quickly as possible\" is defined to mean as soon as the individual is calm or no longer a danger to self or others. 483.450(d)(6) In the presence of a restraint being worn during sleeping hours, surveyors must determine whether it is truly the nature of the individual' s behavior which warrants this significant level of intrusion, or whether it in fact is a substitute for lower staf fing during night time hours. The \"motion and exercise\" requirement applies to all restraints which r e s t r i c t the r a n g e o f m o t i o n of a limb or joint. Therefore, for example, if a helmet is applied to protect a head wound during sleeping hours, and the individual' s range of motion in the neck has not been af fected, then this requirement does n o t apply . \"Motion and exercise\" includes an opportunity for liquid intake and toileting, if needed by the individual. 483.450(e)(1) [This section] 483.450(e)(1) applies to all medications (including medications prescribed to control inappropriate behavior .) Overmedication occurs for many reasons. For medications prescribed to control maladaptive behavior , the most common reasons are: the individual' s maladaptive behavior may not be responsive to drugs (e.g., if an individual has a non-drug-responsive form of self injury , then use of psychotropics may simply lead up to maximum drug doses without suppressing the behavior), drug therapy may be exacerbating the behavior (e.g., if a drug-induced side ef fect is mistaken for agitation, then the physician may mistakenly believe that the individual is undermedicated and increase the dose), presence of polypharmacy within the same drug class may result in a drug dose that would exceed the maximum daily limit for any one drug, the individual may be receiving too frequent injections which may result in significant drug accumulation over time, and the use of daily medication plus PRN or stat (one time) doses may result in greater than the recommended daily doses being prescribed (especially since intramuscular administration may be up to four times as potent). Administration of PRN or stat doses for periods greater than a few weeks may indicate that the individual' s daily dose is sub-therapeutic, the problem will not respond to the prescribed drug or the drug is exacerbating the problem. In such instances the surveyor should verify whether or not the drug regimen has been reassessed. 483.450(e)(2) For these drugs to be an ef fective therapeutic tool, they must be prescribed only to the extent that they are necessary for normal medical management of the individual. In an emer gency , a physician may authorize the use of a drug to modify an inappropriate behavior . However , orders for continued emer gency drug usage cannot continue until the team gives approval, and the drug' s usage has been included in the plan. Psychotropic drug therapy may n o t be used outside of an active treatment program tar geted to eliminate the specific behaviors which are thought to be drug responsive. 483.450(e)(4)(i) Unless the physician regularly evaluates the individual and meets with those who work most closely with the individual to review treatment progress, it will be dif ficult to assess whether the individual responded positively to the treatment. Additionally , since each drug has a specific profile of side ef fects, potential reactions should be looked for by direct examination and questioning. It is important that everyone who works with the individual be aware of the conclusion drawn from these drug reviews. Ch 64, p. 32 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 In addition to monitoring at regular intervals, the individual should be assessed at the time the medication is changed, as well. Individuals receiving long term antipsychotic drug therapy should be examined regularly for motor restlessness, such as Parkinsonian symptoms or tardive dyskinesia. 483.450(e)(4)(ii) Planned drug withdrawals must be carefully instituted. For example, usage of anti-psychotic drug therapy may not only cause tardive dyskinesia but may mask the clinical manifestations of tardive dyskinesia during treatment. W ithdrawal should be gradual, and in low increments to see if the behavior or symptoms are controlled. 483.460(a)(2) The use of a medical care plan is intended only for those [who] are so ill or so at medical risk that 24-hour licensed nursing care is essential. A medical care plan need not be developed unless the individual requires licensed nursing care around the clock. Thus, individuals with chronic, but stable health problems such as controlled epilepsy , diabetes, etc. do not require a medical care plan. 483.460(a)(3) Medical services are provided as necessary to maintain an optimum level of health for e a c h individual and to prevent disability . Medical services include evaluation, diagnosis and treatment as needed by individuals. The names and telephone numbers of physicians to be called in the event of an emer gency must be posted. Procedures must be established that provide steps to be followed when the designated physician is not available. A list of sources for laboratory , radiology , and other medical and remedial services available to the individual must be provided if not provided in-house. There must be a written agreement that specifies the responsibilities of the facility and outside provider . (See \u00a7483.410(a)). In addition to meeting the criteria discussed in the standard, preventive health services must also meet the standards of State and local requirements in this area (e.g., immunization, TB control, screening), if any . Medical services provided through outside arrangements must be under a written agreement. 483.460(a)(3)(i) This standard is intended to be an annual screening so that individuals who need further indepth examination can be identified. If hearing screens are conducted annually by speech-language pathologists or audiologists the physical exam does not need to repeat this information. Information relevant to knowing if the individual can see or hear , and how well, is tantamount [important] for designing an appropriate active treatment strategy responsive to need. If an individual' s vision or hearing can only be assessed through examinations conducted by specialists (e.g., comprehensive ophthalmological examinations and evoked response audiometry (ERA)), these tests need not be conducted yearly , but rather upon specialist' s recommendations. In such situations, determine if yearly , the team evaluates the individual' s vision and hearing response behaviors for change, and makes referrals, if necessary . 483.460(a)(3)(ii) These immunization guides can be obtained from the American Academy of Pediatrics, Elk Grove, IL, telephone: (312) 228-5005, or from the Centers for Disease Control, Division of Immunization Center for Preventive Services, telephone: (404) 639-1857. 483.460(a)(3)(iii) This does not preclude screening tests available to the general public such as tests for urine sugar . 483.460(a)(3)(iv) These recommendations can be obtained from the American Academy of Pediatrics, Elk Grove V illage, IL telephone: (312) 228-5005, or the American College of Chest Physicians, Park Ridge, IL telephone: (312) 698-2200. 483.460(b)(1) During the admission process, which extends from when the individual is admitted to the time the initial IPP is completed, a physician is required to ensure that an assessment of the individual' s medical status is thoroughly considered and addressed by the team as it develops the IPP . The physician' s input may be by means of written reports, evaluations, and recommendations. 42 CFR 456.380 requires that a physician must establish a written plan of care for each applicant or recipient before admission to an ICF . This is done in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team. (Note: \u00a7483.440(c)). IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 33 483.460(c)(1) Unless the individual is on a medical care plan this participation may be through a written report. 483.460(c)(3)(i) A direct physical examination means a full visual review of the full body as well as examination of all body systems that might be necessary . A paper review of the individual' s medical record and health statistics is not a direct physical examination. Determination in addition to other aspects of the examination, whether or not adequate foot care is being assessed. 483.460(c)(3)(iv) The record includes the date of the exam. 483.460(c)(3)(v) This includes nursing care for individuals without a medical care plan. 483.460(c)(5)(i) Facility staf f need to know what the limits of their responsibilities are with medically involved individuals, and how to teach individuals on a continuing basis how to take care of minor accidents until further care can be provided. If it is needed and appropriate, training in health and hygiene methods include the topics of personal hygiene as it relates to health concerns, family planning, venereal disease control, administration of medication, monitoring of health status, self-prevention of health problems. 483.460(d)(2) In evaluating whether or not there is suf ficient licensed nursing staf f, evaluate the need for licensed nursing care represented by the health characteristics of the individuals served (as described in physical exam results, IPPs, and medical care plans) in relation to the competency and qualifications represented by the staf f who provide care (through the onsite survey). Make a judgment about the suf ficiency of nursing staf f to care for this particular population. 483.460(f)(1) A \"month\" is defined to mean the interval between the date of admission and close of business of the corresponding day in the following month. 483.460(f)(2) The requirement applies to all individuals (including those without teeth), and more frequently as dictated by the individual' s needs. 483.460(g) Comprehensive dental treatment might include, but is not limited to: 1. Periodic examination and diagnosis, including radiographs, when indicated, and detection of all manifestations of systemic disease; 2. Elimination of infection or life hazardous oral conditions, oral cancer , or cellulitis; 3. T reatment of injuries; 4. Restoration of decayed or fractured teeth; 5. Retention or recovery of space between teeth in children, when indicated; 6. Replacement of missing permanent teeth, when indicated; and 7. Appropriate pain control procedures for optimal care of the patient. 483.460(h)(1) A \"dental summary ,\" means a brief written report of each visit to the dentist and includes any care instructions to be followed-up by facility staf f as a result of treatment. 483.460(h)(2) The dentist used by the facility must agree to release the records and final recommendations for future care when the individual is dischar ged or discontinues service with the dentist. 483.460(i) Emphasis is placed on the provision of the service, and n o t on its m e t h o d o f d e l i v e r y . Whether the facility utilizes the unit dose, individual prescription or a combination of these systems, or whether the facility has its own pharmacy or provides the service through arrangement with a community pharmacy , the emphasis is on the accuracy of the drug distribution system and the ef fectiveness of the drug therapy . 483.460(j)(1) The pharmacist should review on a more frequent basis the drug regimen of individuals whose response indicates problems with drug therapy . Follow the \"Indicators for Surveyor Assessment of the Performance of Drug Regimen Reviews\" as stated in Appendix N (Pharmaceutical Service Requirements in Long-T erm Care Facilities). 483.460(j)(4) Each dose of medication, whether self-administered or not, shall be properly recorded in the individual' s record. The intent of this requirement is to maintain a record of drugs administered. 483.460(j)(5) The pharmacist needs to participate when the drug regimen of the individual indicates complicated drug therapy strategies, side ef fects, and drug interaction and at the request of the interdisciplinary team. This is not to exclude the pharmacist from the evaluation process, but the Ch 64, p. 34 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 pharmacist can best determine how to expend his/her ef forts most productively in service to individuals at the facility . 483.460(k)(2) \"Self administered\" is defined to mean administration of medications by the individual, independent of a staf f person obtaining, selecting, and preparing the medications for the individual. This includes all usage forms (oral, injections (such as insulin) and suppositories). The individual should be trained until he/she can perform this function without error . As part of the onsite survey , observe a drug pass. See Appendix N, Part T wo, Surveyor Methodology for Detecting Medication Errors. 483.460(k)(3) \"Unlicensed personnel\" of the facility does not refer to the situation of individuals administering their own medication. Unlicensed personnel administer only those forms of medication which State law permits. 483.460(k)(6) Periodically observe the individual to assure that his or her self-administration of medications is error free. 483.460(k)(7) When individuals go out of a facility for home visits, or to attend workshops or school, drugs they are taking must be packaged and labeled in accordance with State law by a responsible person approved to administer medications. Be aware whether or not there are applicable State laws which may allow packaging by someone other than the pharmacist. The test of adequacy of packaging and labeling is whether or not other persons administering medications are able to identify the individual' s medication, method of administration, contraindications if appropriate, and administration schedule. 483.460(l)(2) \"Authorized persons\" must be restricted to those who administer the drugs and nursing supervisors (if any). No other personnel should have access to these keys. 483.460(l)(3) Reconciliation of receipt and disposition of controlled drugs need not be done on each shift. If periodic (e.g., weekly or monthly) reconciliations indicate losses, more frequent reconciliations (daily or by shift) may need to be performed to identify and stop losses. 483.460(m)(3) If a physician discontinues a drug for a particular individual, that particular drug supply should be removed from its usual storage area. This precludes that drug from being administered to the individual in error . 483.460(n) See Appendix C\u2014Independent Laboratory\u2014Laboratory Management 42 CFR 405.1316. Confirm that the laboratory is complying with these requirements. Use Form HCF A-1557 in surveying for these requirements. 483.460(n)(2)(B) Overall laboratory services must be evaluated to determine compliance with this requirement. The laboratory director is responsible for personnel, proficiency testing performance, management (including recordkeeping) and quality control. Determine if the director provides adequate technical supervision; by: observing if laboratory personnel follow the instructions in the laboratory procedure manual for tests performance; evaluating the quality control procedures and deciding if they are adequate for the services of fered; examining quality control records to determine if the laboratory documents remedial action and assures that test results are not reported when these results are not within the established acceptable limits; and reviewing a sample of records to ensure that the specimens are adequately accessioned, processed and/or referred and reported. Also, review the laboratory for compliance with the requirements detailed in Appendix C\u2014 sections on Proficiency T estings (\u00a7405.1314); Laboratory Management (\u00a7405.1316); and Quality Control (\u00a7405.1317). 483.460(n)(2)(C)(1) Observe test performance onsite, if possible, and evaluate quality control procedures to verify that the staf f: Adequately performs tests and quality control procedures; Documents quality control results; and IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 35 T akes remedial action in response to detected defects (including test systems out of control limits). Deficiencies may indicate that the staf f is not adequate (in numbers, training or experience) to perform the test procedures and report the results promptly and proficiently . 483.460(n)(2)(C)(2) Review: (1) staf fing patterns of all shifts; (2) workload volume; (3) volume of priority testing (including stats); and (4) interval between specimen receipt and reporting of results. Interview laboratory employees to evaluate the adequacy of staf fing and coordinate with other members of the survey team to ascertain if tests are performed and reported in accordance with laboratory policies and procedures. 483.460(n)(3) Use Form HCF A-1557 for surveying the facility' s compliance with proficiency testing requirements in accordance with the instructions contained in Appendix C. See 42 CFR 405.1310: Definitions\u2014Independent Laboratories and the on Clinical Laboratory T ests performed\u201442 CFR 405.1314(a). 483.460(n)(4) Confirm that the laboratory is in compliance with the requirements in \u00a7405.1317. (See Appendix C\u2014Independent Laboratories\u2014Quality Control Requirements). 483.470(a)(1) Individuals should live in the least restrictive grouping in keeping with their level of functioning. Prime consideration in the grouping of individuals is made according to social and intellectual development, friendship patterns, and commonality of interests. The use of \"grossly dif ferent ages\" is intended to ensure, for example, that very young children are not inappropriately housed together with much older individuals. Extreme dif ferences may in some instances actually impede appropriate training and may pose a threat to the safety of younger more vulnerable individuals. 483.470(a)(2) Housing of such individuals together would only be appropriate if every individual with a particular physical, sensory , or medical disability also happened to be at the same skill level and, thus, had identical training needs. In such situations, determine if the individuals' skill level rather than the individuals' physical, sensory or medical disability justifies the housing pattern. 483.470(b)(1)(v) An \"initially certified\" facility includes any facility or portion thereof that is certified for participation in Medicaid after a period of non-participation (e.g., if its certification has been terminated or voluntarily withdrawn). A facility' s building qualifies as having \"major renovations or conversions\" if: Individuals must vacate the building during the period of renovation or construction. No Medicaid billing takes place during the period of renovation or construction. A resurvey of the building is required before individuals may return to live in the building. 483.470(b)(2) The intent of the regulation is to prohibit the housing of individuals in basements that are entirely below grade. Individuals may be housed on the lower level of housing (e.g., a bi-level house), provided the window height requirements are met. 483.470(b)(3) Look for trends in a facility which result in lar ge numbers of persons being \"certified\" as requiring more supervision than af forded in a bedroom serving four or fewer persons as a means of justifying continued use of open wards or nominally partitioned wards. The only acceptable reason for persons being housed in bedrooms serving more than four persons is because the individual is in very fragile health and needs extensive life support services, such as posturing for clearing the airways, monitoring for uncontrolled seizures. If more than four persons are housed together in the same room, the number should remain small, and each individual placed in the grouping must have a high level of medical monitoring need. 483.470(b)(4)(iii) A single bedspread may be used year round, if it is appropriate for all seasons. 483.470(b)(4)(iv) \"Furniture\" is to be distinguished from \"furnishings\" (such as plants, pictures, etc.) which though encouraged as being an appropriate and desirable aspect of a normalized living environment, cannot serve as a substitute for appropriate individual furniture that can be used by the individual alone. The facility is permitted either to provide the individual with an individualized closet or with a designated area in a shared closet. Closet space should be suf ficiently lar ge to accommodate clothes Ch 64, p. 36 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 appropriate to the seasons. The use of central clothing bins in a facility clothing room, in the absence of required individual closet space in the bedroom, is not an acceptable practice. 483.470(c)(2) For a storage space to be determined as \"suitable,\" it must assure the safekeeping of the individual' s possessions among other things being stored. Use of the term \"accessible\" does not require unrestricted access in situations where this is precluded by an active treatment program designed to eliminate inappropriate behavior , or in which the individual' s interdisciplinary team determines that unrestricted access would endanger the individual or others. The surveyor should determine whether or not there is a pattern of restricted access not because of the behavior of the individual, but because of the behavior of others with whom the individual lives. This could also raise the question of inappropriate grouping of individuals due to dif ferent functioning abilities. 483.470(d)(1) \"Bathing facilities appropriate in ... design\" includes provisions for a mirror and sink/toothbrushing area within the bathroom. 483.470(d)(2) Gang showers and open toilets are inappropriate to the quality of life, privacy , and personal dignity of the individuals served in the facility . Individual privacy does not preclude the assistance given from the facility' s staf f, when necessitated by the individual' s condition. 483.470(d)(3) Individuals must be under the direct supervision of staf f while being trained to operate hot water temperature controls. 483.470(e)(1)(i) Since a door serves primarily to provide egress rather than to perform the ventilation and aesthetic functions of an outside window , it may not be used for room ventilation in place of a window . 483.470(e)(2)(i) A \"normal comfort range\" in most instances is defined as not going below a temperature of 68\u00b0F or exceeding a temperature of 81\u00b0F for facilities in most geographic areas of the country (primarily at the Northernmost latitudes) where that temperature is exceeded only during rare, brief episodes of unseasonably hot weather . 483.470(f)(1) \"Slip-resistant\" is to be distinguished from \"slip-free\". There is a presumption made that floors will ordinarily be dry , and when wet, appropriate precautions will be taken. 483.470(g)(2) The term \"furnish\" means that the facility is responsible for obtaining these items and is responsible for making any necessary arrangements to enable the individual actually to receive them. However , if an item is available free of char ge the facility would satisfy the requirement simply by making the necessary arrangements for the individual to receive them. The term \"maintain in good repair\" means that the facility is responsible for ensuring that these items are kept in good working order . 483.470(g)(3) A bedroom hamper can be an acceptable dirty linen storage \"area\" if kept odor free, consistent with the infection control requirements at \u00a7483.470(1). 483.470(h)(1) The plan is tailored to potential emer gencies that could occur to the facility , given its geographic location and the types of needs represented by the individuals it serves. 483.470(h)(2) \"Periodic review\" is a judgment made by the facility based on the circumstances of the facility . If the facility changes its physical plant or if changes external to the facility necessitate a review of the disaster plan, then the facility is responsible for carrying out the review . 483.470(i)(1) \"V aried conditions\" principally refers to dif ferent times of the day and night and location of individuals in respect to rooms in the building. It also refers to weather conditions since quarterly drills would necessitate varied weather conditions. 483.470(i)(2)(i) \"Actually evacuate,\" as used in this standard, applies to all individuals. The drills are conducted not only to rehearse the individuals and staf f for fire (see \u00a7483.470(i)(2)(v), but for other disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, etc. Such disasters would require the entire occupancy to be evacuated, and therefore, the actual evacuation must be practiced, as required. 483.470(i)(3) Since live-in staf f and their relief personnel are generally the same staf f who work with the individuals on a round-the-clock basis, they must conduct a minimum of 4 drills a year , each of which must occur at dif ferent times within the day (24 hour period) (i.e., morning, afternoon, and night (sleep time)), and generally when individuals are at dif ferent locations within the house. If the facility has lar ge numbers of relief personnel, more drills may be needed to meet the intent of this requirement. IAC 7/2/08 Inspections and Appeals[481] Ch 64, p. 37 483.470(l)(1) An \"active program\" includes such observable practices as: the direct care staf f routinely washing their hands after working with an individual who has an infectious disease or working with each individual during mealtimes; the continuous use of aseptic technique, when appropriate; an ongoing program of communicable disease control and investigation of infections; and an active training program that ensures the individuals served receive adequate prevention of transmission information and skills, according to needs. Procedures must be followed to prevent cross-contamination, including hand washing or changing gloves at mealtimes, after providing personal care to more than one individual, or when performing other tasks among individuals which provide the opportunity for cross- contamination to occur . Facilities for hand washing must exist and be available for staf f. T oothbrushes and other personal hygiene items must be stored and used in such a manner to prevent cross-contamination. 483.470(l)(4) The facility should use the Recommendations for Prevention of Communicable Disease T ransmission in Health Care Settings (such as preventing HIV) issued by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, 30333, as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines in these areas. 483.480(a)(1) \"Modified and specially prescribed\" diets are defined as diets that are altered in any way to enable the individual to eat (for example, food that is chopped, pureed, etc.) or diets that are intended to correct or prevent a nutritional deficiency or health problem. 483.480(a)(5) Since the main purpose of food is to support and maintain the health of an individual, it is important that the use of food as a behavior reinforcing device (primary reinforcement) not be abused. Foods are selected to provide essential nutrients. When these foods are routinely removed and denied during the meals, w i t h o u t c o m p a r a b l e r e p l a c e m e n t s , the individual is at risk of consuming a diet that is not adequate to meet nutritional needs, and in violation of \u00a7483.420(d)(1)(ii), which does not allow foods contributing to a nutritionally adequate diet to be used as \"punishment.\" Likewise, the addition of high caloric reinforcers must be coordinated into the total daily diet intake. 483.480(a)(6) For suggested guidelines write to: 1. U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Information Services W ashington, D.C. 20250 2. The National Dairy Council Rosemont, IL 60028-4233 483.480(b)(1) The facility should be flexible in arranging individual eating schedules for weekends and holidays, etc. to give the individuals regular opportunities to experience normal rhythms of the year . It is the facility' s responsibility to ensure that meals taken regularly outside the facility are adequate (e.g., that an individual at a community program setting has an adequate lunch carried from the facility or is able to purchase lunch). There is concern that individuals may consume only \"junk\" food instead of an adequate meal when outside the facility . 483.480(b)(1)(i) A \"substantial evening meal\" is defined to mean an of fering of three or more menu items at one time, one of which includes a high-quality protein such as meat, fish, eggs, or cheese. The meal represents no less than 20% of the day' s total nutritional requirements. A \"nourishing snack\" is an of fering of items, single or in combination, from the daily food guide. 483.480(b)(3) This standard does not apply to food served in family-style dishes, unless the length of time the food is on the table or other considerations (such as individuals fingering or drooling in the food) compromise the safety and nutritive value for reuse of the food. 483.480(d)(1) For purposes of this standard \"dining areas\" mean discrete eating areas located outside of bedrooms, established, furnished, and equipped for the purpose of eating meals. For purposes of this standard, provision of meals in dining areas outside of the home (such as restaurants, food vendors, etc.) may also be included. T o the maximum extent possible, individuals should be af forded the opportunity to eat routine meals (like breakfast and dinner) in dining areas that approximate those af forded to their peers without Ch 64, p. 38 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 7/2/08 disabilities (e.g., dining areas that are a part of the living unit, rather than eating all meals in b u i l d i n g s exclusively established for eating purposes). 483.480(d)(2) The intent of this regulation is to af ford individuals the opportunity to participate in the social experience of dining with their dining companions. Observe whether or not facility staf f model and reinforce appropriate communication and social behavior between dining companions seated at the same table. 483.480(d)(3) Single service eating devices must be discarded after each use. Determine if the following types of adaptive devices are made available when needed: 1. Double suction cups or other devices to anchor dishes on a table or tray for individuals with major coordination problems; 2. Rocking one-handed knife-fork or knife-spoon for an individual with the use of only one hand; 3. Built-up or extended handles or silverware for those with problems of grasp or range of motion; 4. Place guards or plates with raised rims to provide a surface against which the individual with a physical disability can push food onto a fork or a spoon; 5. Flexible drinking straws; 6. Spoon bent to a 90\u00b0 angle at the bowl or a swivel spoon to assist an individual without normal wrist motions; 7. Any other adaptive device deemed by the team as needed by the individual to eat more independently . 483.480(d)(4) T o the maximum extent possible staf f should model appropriate mealtime behavior and conversation by sitting at the table with individuals, and, when possible eating meals with individuals. Mastery of the social skills involved in eating in a variety of dining areas and settings is another step to the individual' s independence beyond the health aspects of nutrition and the basic skills involved in eating independently . Achieving independence will further help the individual to live in less restrictive environments. Determine to what extent individuals are exposed to out-of-the-home dining environments available to the general public (e.g., restaurants, fast-food establishments, picnics, parties, cafeterias, etc.) 483.480(d)(5) This applies to all individuals, including those fed by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube. The IPP should identify the most appropriate position for the individual to be positioned during mealtime, in relation to the placement of the food contents.
