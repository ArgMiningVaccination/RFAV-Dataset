And it can provide great healing, too. This is especially true when it comes to medicinal plants and herbs, which can provide a range of benefits, including supporting the immune system, decreasing stress and anxiety, and so much more. Up ahead, we tap three experts to learn more about herbal medicine and how you can add healing plants to your garden for well-being. \"Herbal medicine is the study and practice of working with edible and/or medicinal plants in various ways that support health and [well-being](https://chopra.com/articles/ayurveda-for-spiritual-well-being) on all levels: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually,\" says [Jenna Volpe](https://wholeisticliving.com/), a holistic dietitian and clinical herbalist. Although it might seem daunting (especially if you're new to gardening), using plants in a medicinal way is simple and, in many ways, can feel primordial. Working with herbal medicine is like getting back to our healing roots, as herbs were the first medicines used by humans. \"You can trace back the use of herbal medicines to almost any traditional culture,\" says Sandra Nanka, the owner and herb expert at [Mudbrick Herb Cottage](https://www.herbcottage.com.au/). From monasteries with herb gardens that treated the local community to shamans who healed through native plants, there are so many examples of herbal medicine from the past, which can be used in the present. According to [Sean Rose](https://www.tenderhearted.love/), a clinical herbal therapist, gardening in many ways is another form of herbal medicine. \"It's another way to live in community and conversation with living beings that care for each other, especially when you begin to garden with medicinal plants,\" he explains. \"Once you learn about herbs, you begin to see them all around you everywhere you go, and you get this sense that a helpful friend (a medicinal plant) is never far away from you.\" Getting more in touch with herbal medicine is as simple as growing a few medicinal plants in your garden. \"As you take care of these plants, you learn their language\u2014how they communicate that they need more or less water and more or less sun,\" says Rose. \"Plus, there's just something about getting your hands in the earth or tasting an aromatic herb right off the stem that connects you immediately to the here and now, and gets you out of your daily worries and ruminations,\" he adds, noting that gardening is a [grounding practice](https://chopra.com/articles/ground-yourself-with-this-guide-to-pranayama). Here are the best healing plants to add to your garden. In addition to planting them in your garden, there are tons of amazing ways to add herbal medicine to your everyday life\u2014most of which are accessible and easy to try. One of the best things about medicinal plants is that they are a lot more accessible than you think. If you don't have space for a garden, you can plant a few [herbs](https://chopra.com/articles/calming-herbs-to-balance-your-vata-dosha) for cooking and place them on the windowsill for nourishment from the sun. And, according to Nanka, if you can't grow your own herbs, \"you can visit farmer's markets to purchase a wide range of herb greens to add flavor and nutrition to your food.\" Dried herbs for making tea can also be purchased online or at local natural food stores. And, of course, you can always wander down the spice aisle at your grocery store for some flavorful ingredients to add to your home-cooked meals.
