Initiate After selecting the best drug therapy for an individual patient, the clinician also determines the most appropriate initial dose and dosage schedule and writes an order or prescription. Monitor Once drug therapy is initiated, the clinician evaluates response, adverse effects, therapeutic outcomes, and adherence to determine if the drug, dose, or dosage schedule can be continued or needs to be modified. Continue After monitoring the current drug therapy of a patient, the clinician decides to renew or continue the same drug, dose, and dosage schedule. Modify After monitoring a patient's drug therapy, the clinician decides to make an adjustment in dose and/or dosage schedule, or may add, discontinue, or change drug therapy. Administer Regardless of who initiates a patient's drug therapy, the clinician gives the drug directly to the patient, including all routes of administration. Carmichael JM, et al.

In such cases, only sufficient quantity may be provided until the patient is able to be seen by another provider. The board shall not adopt any rules authorizing a pharmacist to prescribe a controlled drug.Idaho Pharmacist Prescribing Laws Existing Independent Prescribing Authority in AK Collaborative Practice Authority AS 08.80.168(a) -vaccines and related emergency medications AS 08.80.168(b) -opioid overdose drugExisting Independent Prescribing Authority in AK AS 08.80.337 Other patient care services . (a) A pharmacist may, under a collaborative practice agreement with a written protocol approved by a practitioner, provide patient care services. (b) A pharmacist may independently provide patient care services for (1) general health and wellness; (2) disease prevention; or (3) a condition that (A) is minor and generally self limiting; (B) has a test that is used to guide diagnosis or clinical decision -making and the test is waived under 42 U.S.C. 263a (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988); or (C) falls under a statewide standing order from the chief medical officer in the Department of Health. (c) This section does not authorize a pharmacist to prescribe a prescription drug that the pharmacist is not otherwise authorized to prescribe. (d) In this section, \"patient care services\" means medical care services given in exchange for compensation intended to achieve outcomes related to the cure or prevention of a disease, elimination or reduction of a patient's symptoms, or arresting or slowing of a disease process.Standard of Care Regulation The \"medical standard of care\" is typically defined as the level and type of care that a reasonably competent and skilled health care professional, with a similar background and in the same medical community, would have provided under the circumstances. This is often considered within the context of actions that led to alleged malpractice. 1 The regulatory model based on the \"standard of care\" is determined by the individual circumstances that present in practice rather than specific requirements codified in law, allowing for flexibility as practice guidelines change, technology changes, and new knowledge is identified. This model requires less regulatory modification to keep pace with change. 1 Example: IDAPA 24.36.01.104.16 Standard of Care. Acts or omissions within the practice of pharmacy which fail to meet the standard provided by other qualified licensees or registrants in the same or similar setting.Bright Line Regulation An objective rule that resolves a legal issue in a straightforward, predictable manner. A bright -line rule is easy to administer and leaves little room for varying interpretation. Example: Miranda v. Arizona (1966) establishing Miranda warning of rights to criminal suspects Example: IDAPA 24.36.01.213 Each pharmacist must complete fifteen (15) CPE hours each calendar year between January 1 and December 31.Scope of Practice The services that a qualified health care professional is deemed competent to perform and permitted to undertake in keeping with the terms of their professional licensure.Scope of Practice The activities that a health professional is permitted to engage in as defined by state laws and regulations Determined by the political process = geographical differences One-size- fits all: applies to all professionals in class Static (aside from law changes)Clinical Ability The true competence and ability of the health professional Determined by education, training, career experience, and practice environment Individualistic: recognizes professional heterogeneity Dynamic; advances with new education, technology, etc. CAN MAYPractitioner A Practitioner B Practitioner CEntry Barrier (Minimum Competency)Legal Ceiling (\"Top of License\") Scope of PracticePractitioner A Practitioner B Practitioner CEntry Barrier (Minimum Competency)Legal Ceiling (\"Top of License\") Scope of PracticePharmacists Patient Care Process (PPCP) In 2014, the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP) developed and released the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process The PPCP is the profession's systematic approach for pharmacist provision of care, regardless of the type of service or the pharmacy practice setting ACPE requires pharmacy schools include in curricula Consistent implementation across the profession is critically important to effectively measure the outcomes and value of pharmacists' services, and so that consumers, health care providers, and payers have consistent expectations for the services they receive from pharmacistRegulatory Impact on Implementation of the PPCP 44Benchmarking the Regulatory Environment Benchmarking the Regulatory Environment Lessons Learned: Key Success Factors Keep the focus on public safety Strategic planning meetings to align the Board around direction and framework before getting into the rulemaking or legislation details Empower board staff to draft new rules or statute language and do not wordsmith in public meetings Place the burden of proof on those advocating to add back in or increase regulation Create proper accountability measures for disciplining standard of care casesLessons Learned: Barriers to Reform General professional reticence Judging policy by your own personal interests Treating every issue as brand new and not learning from the experiences of other professions or jurisdictions Defining requirements for every new task, business model, or facility type Adding new rules without a review/amendment/sunset process for the entire rule or other similar rulesSuggested Rule Changes for AK OPTION A Article 2 Personnel 12 AAC 52. 205 PRACTICE OF PHARMACY: GENERAL APPROACH To determine whether a specific act is within the scope of pharmacy practice in or into Alaska, or whether an act can be delegated to other individuals under their supervision, a licensee or registrant of the Board must independently determine whether: 01.Express Prohibition.

June 20 Special Meeting Regulations work, and working on technician licensing for high school student enrolled in programs leading to national certificationUpcoming Conference Health System Pharmacy and Leadership Conference ~ September 21 - 23rd at Alyeska Resort Partnered with IHS -looking forward to having pharmacists from all across the state Great CE on clinical updates and leadership Hearing from Representative Ruffridge on advocacy, Dr. Jen Adams on building strength based teams, clinical updates on ischemic stroke, infectious disease / antibiotic stewardship, new drugs and more We would love to have board of pharmacy members there to network with licensees -if interested in attending please reach out for more info akpharmacistsassociation@gmail.comUpdate on SB 121 No hearing in 2023 session Working during interim with coalition Met last week with our Tribal Health coalition representative (Dan Nelson from Chief Andrew Isaac), Board of Pharmacy Chair Ashley Schaber, AKPhA Executive Director, Senator Giessel (bill sponsor), Director of the Division of Insurance, Acting Director of AlaskaCare, and DOA Legislative Liaison FTC has reversed policies in support of PBMs ACPE Joint Providership for BOP Meetings AKPhA is excited to be working with the Board to enter a joint providership agreement Once finalized, the Association would accredit certain agenda items of BOP meetings for CE credit This is a great partnership opportunity and will hopefully drive participation by licensees in BOP meetings Alaska Board of Pharmacy Agenda Item #9 Adjourn for Lunch Alaska Board of Pharmacy Agenda Item #10 Roll Call/Call to Order Alaska Board of Pharmacy Agenda Item #11 Public Comment Period Alaska Board of Pharmacy Agenda Item #12 Board Business Question: Does the Board of Pharmacy have authority to issue reciprocal disciplinary action on a facility licensed in Alaska but located outside of the state based on license discipline that occurred in a different jurisdiction? (Also including a few more \"break down\" questions below.) Example - ABC Wholesaler, located in Dallas, TX, is licensed as a Wholesale Drug Distributor (WDD) in 10 other states including Alaska. Their home jurisdiction is Texas, but their Alabama license has been suspended by the Alabama Board of Pharmacy for sending contr olled substances into the state of Alabama from their Texas facility without a DEA registration number. 1. Does the Alaska Board of Pharmacy have the statutory authority to take reciprocal action on the Alaska WDD license based on the Alabama suspension? A S 08.80.157 gives the Board the authority to suspend or revoke the license after it learns of a violation of a federal, state, or local law (i.e., the suspension). Alaska can give notice to the licensee that it has become aware of the action and that it in tends to take action based upon that (Notice of Complaint). The licensee then has the opportunity to respond. Suspension/Revocation is not automatic and Alaska still has to go through its processes. How/why is the action in another state a problem? In othe r words, Alaska still has to articulate why the action which led to the suspension in State 1 is a health, safety concern for Alaska or a violation of Alaska statute. If a licensee if suspended because they were 10 days late in paying their renewal fee, Al aska would have a very difficult road. Versus the licensee (facility) was suspended because they were selling unsafe products and refused to comply with an FDA recall request. The board then has a strong argument that they risked public safety. Best if Ala ska can tie the violation to something enumerated in AS 08.80.157(h)(4). 2. Does the Alaska Board of Pharmacy have the statutory authority to take reciprocal action on the Alaska WDD license if the Texas license if affected by this suspension since it is t he home jurisdiction? Home jurisdiction is irrelevant so long as there was an action which fits under AS 08.80.157(h)(1) - a finding by the board of a violation of federal, state or local law \"relating to the practice of pharmacy, drug samples, wholesale o r retail drug or device distribution, or distribution of controlled substances.\" The statute does not have a limitation to the action having to have occurred only in the original licensing home jurisdiction. 3. Does the Alaska Board of Pharmacy have the st atutory authority to take any action at all on the Alaska WDD license for any action outside of the state of Alaska? Yes. See AS 08.80.157(h)(1) and AS 08.80.157(h)(4). (This is another way of asking the above two questions.) Process wise, the board proceeds just like it would with a local pharmacist who broke a rule. Notice of Complaint, Notice of Investigation - attempt to get Con sent Agreement and if that fails, Accusation, etc. The fact that the wholesaler is out -of-state and/or has a licensee elsewhere has no bearing. The pharmacy statutes, while clunky, do get the board where they are wanting to go. Moreover, the facility is li kely required to disclose the matter on their renewals per the professional fitness questions. If they fail to do so, there are additional grounds for action based upon the failure to disclose. Report of Theft or Loss of Controlled Substances OMB No. 1117-0 001 (Exp.

Who i s my designated e thics s upervisor (DES)? Every board or commission subject to the Ethics Act 1 has several ethics supervisors designated by statute: The chair serves as DES for board or commission members. The chair serves as DES for the executive director. The executive director serves as DES for the staff. The governor is the DES for a chair.2 What d o I h ave t o disclose? The Ethics Act requires members of boards and commissions to disclose: Any matter that is a potential conflict of interest with actions that the member may take when serving on the board or commission. Any circumstance that may result in a violation of the Ethics Act. Any personal or financial interest (or that of an immediate family member) in a state grant, contract, lease or loan that is awarded or administered by the member's board or commission. The receipt of certain gifts. The executive director of the board or commission and its staff, as state employees, must also disclose: Compensated outside employment or services. Volunteer service, if any compensation, including travel and meals, is paid, there is a potential conflict with state duties. For more informatio n regarding the types of matters that may result in violations of the Ethics Act, board or commission members should refer to the guide, \"Ethics Information for Members of Boards and Commissions.\" The executive director and staff should refer to the guide, Ethics Information for Public Employees.\" Both guides and disclosure forms may be found on the Department of Law's ethics website: http://www.law.state.ak.us/doclibrary/ethics.html . 1 The Act covers a board, commission, authority, or board of directors of a public or quasi -public corporation, established by statute in the executive branch of state government. 2 The governor has delegated the DES responsibility to Shawn Henderson, Administrative Director of the Office of the Governor. THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 2 of 5 How d o I avoid violations of the Ethics Act? Make timely disclosures! Follow required procedures! Provide all information necessary for a correct evaluation of the matter!3 When in doubt, disclose and seek advice! Follow the advice of your DES! What are the disclosure p rocedures for b oard and c ommission members? The procedural requirements for disclosures by members are set out in AS 39.52.220 and 9 AAC 52.120. One goal of these provisions is to help members avoid violations of the Ethics Act. The procedures provide the opportunity for members to seek review of matters in advance of taking action to ensure that actions taken will be consistent with the Act. Procedure for declaring actual or potential conflicts. Members must declare potential confl icts and other matters that may violate the Ethics Act on the public record and in writing to the chair. Disclosure on the public record. Members must identify actual and potential conflicts orally at the board or commission's public meeting in advance of participating in deliberations or taking any official action on the matter. A member must always declare a conflict and may choose to refrain from voting, deliberations or other participation regarding a matter 4. If a member is uncertain whether partici pation would result in a violation of the Act, the member should disclose the circumstances and seek a determination from the chair. Disclosure in writing at a public meeting. In addition to an oral disclosure at a board or commission meeting, members' disclosures must be made in writing. If the meeting is recorded, a tape or transcript of the meeting is preserved and there is a method for identifying the declaration in the record, an oral disclosure may serve as the written disclosure. Altern atively, the member must note the disclosure on the Notice of Potential Violation disclosure form and the chair must record the determination. Confidential disclosure in advance of public meeting. Potential conflicts may be partially addressed in advance of a board or commission's public meeting based on the published meeting agenda or other board or commission activity. 3 You may supplement the disclosur e form with other written explanation as necessary. Your signature on a disclosure certifies that, to the best of your knowledge, the statements made are true, correct and complete. False statements are punishable. 4 In most, but not all, situations, refra ining from participation ensures that a violation of the Ethics Act does not occur. Abstention does not cure a conflict with www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 3 of 5 A member identifying a conflict or potential conflict submits a Notice of Potential Violation to the chair, as DES, in advance of the public meeting. This written disclosure is considered confidential. The chair may seek advice from the Attorney General. The chair makes a written determination, also confidential, whether the disclosed matter represents a conflict that will result in a v iolation of the Ethics Act if the member participates in official action addressing the matter. 5 If so, the chair directs the member to refrain from participating in the matter that is the subject of the disclosure. An oral report of the notice of potential violation and the determination that the member must refrain from participating is put on the record at a public meeting. 6 Determinations at the public meeting. When a potential conflict is declared by a member for the public record, the following procedure must be followed: The chair states his or her determination regarding whether the member may participate. Any member may then object to the chair's determination. If an objection is made, the members present, excluding the member who made the disclosure, vote on the matter. Exception : A chair's determination that is made consistent with advice provided by the Attorney General may not be overruled. If the chair, or the members by majority vote, determines that a violation will exist if the disclosing member continues to participate, the member must refrain from voting, deliberating or participating in the matter.7 If the chair identifies a potential conflict, the same procedures are followed. If possible, the chair should forward a co nfidential written notice of potential violation to the Office of the Governor for a determination in advance of the board or commission meeting. If the declaration is first made at the public meeting during which the matter will be addressed, the members present, except for the chair, vote on the matter. If a majority determines that a violation of the Ethics Act will occur if the chair continues to participate, the chair shall refrain from voting, deliberating or participating in the matter. A written dis closure or copy of the public record regarding the oral disclosure should be forwarded to the Office of the Governor for review by the chair's DES. 5 The chair must give a copy of the written determination to the disclosing member. There is a determination form available on the Department of Law's ethics web page. The ethics supervisor may also write a separate memorandum. 6 In this manner, a member's detailed personal and financial information may be protected from public disclosure. 7 When a matter of particular sensitivity is raised and the ramifications of continuing without an advisory opinion from the Attorney General may affect the validity of the board or commission's action, the members should consider tabling the matter so that an opinion may be obtained. www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 4 of 5 Procedures for other member d isclosures A member's interest in a state grant, contract, lease or loan and receipt of gifts are disclosed by filling out the appropriate disclosure form and submitting the form to the chair for approval. The disclosure forms are found on the Department of Law's ethics website: http://www.law.state.ak.us/doclibrary/ethics.html What are the disclosure p rocedures for e xecutive d irectors and s taff? Ethics disclosures of the executive director or staff are made in writing to the appropriate DES (chair for the executive director and the executive director for staff). Disclosure forms are found on the ethics website, noted above. Notices of Potential Violations. Following receipt of a written notice of potential violation, the DES investigates, if necessary, and makes a written determination whether a violation of the Ethics Act could exist or will occur. A DES may seek advice from the Attorney General. If feasible, the DES shall reassign duties to cure a potential violation or direct divestiture or removal by the employee of the personal or financial interests giving rise to the potential violation. These disclosures are not required to be made part of the publi c record. A copy of a determination is provided to the employee. Both the notice and determination are confidential. Other Disclosures. The DES also reviews other ethics disclosures and either approves them or determines what action must be taken to avoid a violation of the Act. In addition to the disclosures of certain gifts and potential conflicts of interest, state employees must disclose all outside employment or services for compensation. The DES must provide a copy of an approved disclosure or ot her determination to the employee. How are t hird p arty r eports of p otential violations or c omplaints h andled? Any person may report a potential violation of the Ethics Act by a board or commission member or its staff to the appropriate DES or file a complaint alleging actual violations with the Attorney General. Notices of potential violations and complaints must be submitted in writing and under oath. Notices of potential violations are investigated by the appropriate DES who makes a written determination whether a violation may exist. 8 Complaints are addressed by the Attorney General under separate procedures outlined in the Ethics Act. These matters are confidential, unless the subject waives confidentiality or the matter results in a public accusation. 8 The DES p rovides a copy of the notice to the employee who is the subject of the notice and may seek input from the employee, his or her supervisor and others. The DES may seek advice from the Attorney General. A copy of the DES' written determination is provided to the subject employee and the complaining party. The DES submits a copy of both the notice and the determination to the Attorney General for review as part of the DES' quarterly report. If feasible, the DES shall reassign duties to cure a potential viola tion or direct divestiture or removal by the employee of the personal or financial interests giving rise to the potential violation. www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 5 of 5 What are the procedures for q uarterly r eports? Designated ethics supervisors must submit copies of notices of potential violations received and the corresponding determinations to the Attorney General for review by the state ethics attorney as part of the quarterly report required by the Ethics Act. Reports are due in April, July, October and January for the preceding quarter. A sample report may be found on the Department of Law's ethics website . An executive director may file a quarterly report on behalf of the chair and combine it with his or her own report. If a board or commission does not meet during a quarter , and there is no other reportable activity, the DES shall advise Jenn Williams by e -mail at Jennifer.williams1@alaska.gov and no other report is required. If the state ethics attorney disagrees with a reported determination, the attorney will advise the DES of that finding. If the ethics attorney finds that there was a violation, the member who committed the violation is not liable if he or she fully disclosed all relevant facts reasonably necessary t o the ethics supervisor's or commission's determination and acted consistent with the determination. How d oes a DES or b oard or c ommission get ethics advice? A DES or board or commission may make a written request to the Attorney General for an opinion regarding the application of the Ethics Act. In practice, the Attorney General, through the state ethics attorney, also provides advice by phone or e - mail to designated ethics supervisors, especially when time constraints prevent the preparation of timely written opinions. A request for advice and the advisory opinion are confidential. The ethics attorney endeavors to provide prompt assistance, although that may not always be possible. The DES must make his or her determination addressing the potential violation based on the opinion provided. * * * * * It is the obligation of each board or commission member, as well as the staff, to ensure that the public's business is conducted in a manner that is consistent with the standards set out in the Ethics Act. We hope this summary assists you in ensuring that your obligations are met. EXECUTIVE SESSION MOTION Sec. 44.62.310. G overnment meetings public.

The simple , yet effective, rules below serve as a set of expectations to keep board and commission meetings productive and respectful. Most important, the consistent use of the cornerstones of Robert 's Rules builds the public's trust and reflects positively on all involved. 1. Everyone participates. As the Chair, encouraging the full participation of team members allows your support staff and the public to have a clear understanding of everyone's view of the issue at hand. Call on quiet team members , as they may only need a clarification or an explanation. 2. Different opinions are welcome, but the board must stay on track. The Chair helps guide the team to places of agreement, so the discussion should focus on areas that need clarification, legal advice, or further vetting. Keep the discussion on track or you may find yourself in the middle of a disagreement in which there are no winner s and no productive actions . 3. Limit s ide conversations. A quick question or clarification is one thing, but it can be disconcerting when whispered conversations are held between members of the board during an open meeting. It does nothing to encourage trust between the board and the public, a nd the Chair should not allow it. 4. Re-state the m otion and clarify amendments. This is a simple way for the Chair to be sure that everyone on the team is on the same page as you move through the process. It also gives support staff the opportunity to clari fy the language or intent if needed. It can be surprising how often people are halfway through an argument before they realize they didn't have a clear understanding of the motion or amendment before them. As a member of the board or commission, don't hesi tate to ask for clarification if you are unsure. 5. Hold team members accountable. If a board member is interrupting others, rude to staff , or refusing to keep their comments on track, the Chair should call for a brief at ease and address it with them directly. Honest mistakes or over -eagerness can be quietly corrected at a break, but deliberate bad behavior by anyone should never be tolerated by the Chair. 6. Listen respectfully and thoughtfully to p ublic testimony. Remember that the public has an important role in the process. They have given their time and effort to be heard, and the issue at hand is probably very important to them personally. If testimony gets heated, the Chair can always call for a n at ease so that tempers can cool. 7. Cell phones off. Ringing phones are annoying, but texting someone in the audience or another board member during the meeting is disconcerting and secretive. This does not encourage trust between the team members themselves or the public. 8. Speak clearly. When before the public, always speak so that they can hear you. You may not have a good sound system to amplify your voice, so speak loudly and clearly. THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Robert's Rules 11th ed. Page 1 of 6 Boards and Commissions Office of the Governor 550 W 7th Ave. Suite 1700 Anchorage, Alaska 99501 907-269-0006 Introduction to Robert's Rules of Order What is parliamentary procedure? It is a set of rules for conduct at meetings, which allows everyone to be heard and to make decisions without confusion. Why is parliamentary procedure important? Because it is a time -tested method of conducting business at meetings and public gatherings. It can be adapted to fit the needs of any organization. Today , Robert's Rules of Order Newly R evised is the basic handbook of operation for most clubs, organizations , and other groups. It is important that everyone is familiar with these basic rules! Order of Business: Organizations using parliamentary procedure usually follow s a fixed order of business. A typical example: 1. Call to order. 2. Roll call of members present. 3. Reading of minutes of last meeting. 4. Officer's reports. 5. Committee reports. 6. Special orders --- Important business previously designated for consideration at this meeting. 7. Unfinished business. 8. New business. 9. Announcements. 10. Adjournment. Motions: The method used by members to express themselves is in the form of moving motions. A motion is a proposal that the entire membership take action or a stand on an issue. Individual members can: 1. Call to order. 2. Second motions. 3. Debate motions. 4. Vote on motions. Types of Motions: 1. Main Motions: The purpose of a main motion is to introduce items to the membership for their consideration. They cannot be made when any other motion is on the floor, and yield to privileged, subsidiary, and incidental motions. 2. Subsidiary Motions: Their purpose is to change or affect how a main motion is handled, and is voted on before a main motion. 3. Privileged Motions: Their purpose is to bring up items that are urgent about special or important matters unrelated to pending business. 4. Incidental Motions: Their purpose is to provide a means of questioning procedure concerning other motions and must be considered before the other motion. THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Robert's Rules 11th ed. Page 2 of 6 How is a Motion Presented? 1. Obtaining the floor : a. Wait until the last speaker has finished. b. Rise and address the Chairman by saying, \"Mr. Chairman, or Mr. President.\" c. Wait until the Chairman recognizes you. 2. Make Your Motion: a. Speak in a clear and concise manner. b. Always state a motion affirmatively. Say, \"I move that we ...\" rather than, \"I move that we do not ...\". c. Avoid personalities and stay on your subject . 3. Wait for Someone to S econd Your Motion. 4. Another member will second your motion or the Chairman will call for a second. 5. If there is no second to your motion, it is lost. 6. The Chairman States Your Motion: a. The Chairman will say, \"it has been moved and seconded that we ...\" Thus, placing your motion before the membership for consideration and action. b. The membership then either debates your motion or may move directly to a vote. c. Once your motion is presented to the membership by the C hairman it becomes \"assembly property \" and cannot be changed by you without the consent of the members. 7. Expanding on Your Motion: a. The time for you to speak in favor of your motion is at this point , rather than at the time you present it. b. The mover is always allowed to speak first. c. All comments and debate must be directed to the Chairman. d. Keep to the time limit for speaking that has been established. The mover may speak again only after other speakers are finished, unless called upon by the Chairman. 1. Putting the Question to the Membership : a. The Chairman asks, \"Are you ready to vote on the question?\" b. If there is no more discussion, a vote is taken. c. On a motion to move , the previous question may be adapted. Voting on a Motion: The method of vote on any motion depends on the situation and the by -laws of policy of your organization. There are five methods used to vote by most organizations, they are: 1. By Voice -- The Chairman asks those in favor to say, \"aye\", those opposed to say \"no\". Any member may move for an exact count. 2. By Roll Call -- Each member answers \"yes\" or \"no\" as his name is called. This method is used when a record of each person's vote is required. 3. By General Consent -- When a motion is not likely to be opposed, the Chairman says, \"if there is no objection ...\" The membership shows agreement by their silence, however if one member says, \"I object,\" the item must be put to a vote. 4. By Division -- This is a slight verification of a voice vote. It does not require a count unless the chairman so desires. Members raise their hands or stand. 5. By Ballot -- Members write their vote on a slip of paper, this method is used when s ecrecy is desired. www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Robert's Rules 11th ed. Page 3 of 6 There are two other motions that are commonly used that relate to voting. 1. Motion to Table -- This motion is often used in the attempt to \"kill\" a motion. The option is always present, however, to \"take from the table\", for reconsideration by the membership. 2. Motion to Postpone Indefinitely -- This is often used as a means of parliamentary strategy and allows opponents of motion to test their strength without an actual vote being taken. Also, debate is once again open on the main motion. Parliamentary Procedure is the best way to get things done at your meetings. It will only work if you us e it properly. Most importantly, BE COURTEOUS . 1. Allow motions that are in order. 2. Have members obtain the floor properly. 3. Speak clearly and concisely. 4. Obey the rules of debate.

The Open Meetings Act (OMA) is intended to ensure that decisions made and actions taken are public knowledge and represent the will of the public that the governing body serves. In essence, the OMA protects the public's right to know. To be able to protect the public's right to know, the OMA requires that: all deliberations and action taken by a public entity must be done in public view, with limited exceptions; the public must be provided prior knowledge of all steps occurring in the decision -making process, with limited exceptions; and that individual actions of an official are made known. In order for these requirements to have full effect, meetings must occur as provided in the notice; and, with few exceptions, the public must be allowed to involve itself in the meeting. The public must also have access to materials being considered during the meeting. In addition to laying out specific steps required for meetings and allowable exceptions, the statutes addressing open meetings speak about the state's policy regarding what authority the public has delegated to governing bodies. Following is a synopsis. According to the 'State Policy Regarding Meetings' (AS 44.62.312): The government exists to aid in conducting the people's business. Government units should act and deliberate openly. The people do not yield sovereignty to government agencies that serve them. Public servants have not been given the right to decide what is good or not good for the people to know. People should remain informed so they may retain control over the government they created. The use of teleconferences is for the convenience of the parties, public, and government. The Open Meetings Act should be narrowly construed to effectuate these policies and avoid unnecessary exemptions . What is the Open Meetings Act? The State of Alaska's Open Meetings Act (AS 44.62.310- .312), is a law that addresses the meetings of public entities; it protects the public's right to know and their opportunity to be heard. Among other things, the Act: defines public meetings and public entities; lays out specific requirements for public notice; requires that all meetings of a governmental body of a public entity are open to the public; lays out provisions for attendance at meetings and voting methods; lays out provisions for distribution of meeting materials; and lists the few exceptions to the Act, as well as matters that may be discussed in executive session. In order to assure that the public information/participation provisions of the Act are met, the Act requires that the public entity must provide \"reasonable\" notice that meets the requirements of the Act. To meet these notice requirements, the notice must: be provided within a reasonable amount of time prior to the meeting; include the date, time, and place of the meeting; be posted at the principal office of the public entity, in addition to any other methods and locations stated in local ordinance; and be done in the same way each time (consistent). THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 2 of 8 What is the definition of a meeting that would fall under the provisions of the Open Meetings Act? AS 44.62.310(h) provides detailed definitions of \"governmental body,\" \"meeting,\" and \"public entity\" that, when combined, define what constitutes a public meeting. The Act makes a distinction between what constitutes a meeting of a policy/decision- making body and what constitutes a meeting of an advisory -only body. A meeting of a decision - or policy- making body occurs when more than three members , or a majority of the members, whichever is less, engage collectively in discussion of a subject that the body is authorized to act and set policy on and is therefore subject to the Open Meetings Act. Under this definition, it doesn't matter where the meeting occurs, if it was prearranged, or who arranged it and could include unplanned casual or social contact. A meeting of an advisory -only body is a prearranged gathering to consider a matter on which the entity is authorized to advise and assist the decision -making body and is subject to the provisions of the Act. The Act doesn't specify a number, so two or more members, if the gathering is prearranged for the purpose of conducting any business of the entity, could constitute a meeting. What types of meetings might be conducted that would require notice under the Open Meetings Act? Following are the most common types of meetings that would be subject to the Open Meetings Act: Regular Meetings: State law requires that the governing body conduct its business at regularly scheduled meetings that are open to the public. Regular meetings must be held at least once a month and may be held more often, as required or established in local ordinance. The local code of ordinances should provide the date, time, and place of regular meetings so that everyone knows when regular meetings will take place. The public shouldn't have to wonder about the meeting time, date, and place always changing. If at times it is necessary to reschedule the regular meeting, notice must be posted informing the public that the regular meeting has been rescheduled and when it will be held. Special Meetings : Special meetings have the same requirements as regular meetings, except that they are called for a different time than that fixed for regular meetings. For example, local ordinance may require that the governing body hold its regular meeting on the third Tuesday of each month at 7:00 PM at the municipal offices. If the governing body must meet earlier, it can call a special meeting for a different date. The special meeting does not take place instead of the regular meeting, it is in addition to the regular meeting. Special meetings should be held rarely and only to address time sensitive issues. A special meeting may be held with less than 24-hour' s notice if all members are present or if absent members have waived in writing the required notice. Waiver of notice can be made before or after the special meeting is held. Emergency Meetings: Emergency meetings are held to address situations that are so urgent that the governing body must meet right away. An emergency meeting may be held if a majority of the members are given at least 24 hours oral or written notice and reasonable efforts are made to notify all members. Committee Meetings: Permanent (\"standing\") committees and temporary (\"ad hoc\") committees of the governing body may be formed to study particular issues in more detail. Standing committees may include the finance committee, public works committee, and/or a facilities committee. Ad hoc committees are formed to address a specific situation and are disbanded once the situation has been dealt with. Committees may be composed of all members of the governing body (referred to as a committee of the whole), or of fewer members, usually three. A committee cannot take action on behalf of the full governing body but instead makes a recommendation to the governing body for the governing body's action. Usually the committee of the whole meets to discuss items that are not ready for action but need further discussion in an informal setting. For example, the annual budget usually requires a work session before it is formally adopted. Board of Equalization: The governing body, or its appointees, sits as the Board of Equalization in municipalities that levy a property tax. AS 29.45.200(a) states, \"the governing body sits as a board of equalization for the purpose of hearing an appeal from a determination of the assessor.\" A property owner who believes the assessor has made a mistake in the yearly valuation of their property may appeal the assessor's decision to the board of adjustment, which meets once a year. www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 3 of 8 How much notice is required to meet the \"reasonable\" public notice provision of the Open Meetings Act? How much notice is required depends on the complexity of the issue and the potential effect it will have. Proper public notice must be provided in advance of the proposed action and local ordinances should state the minimum number of days that notice is required. This number should be adjusted up if the situation warrants additional notice. Special and emergency meetings require only 24-hour notice or less. If less notice is given, absent members must waive the notice requirement. Notice requirements for work sessions and committee meetings should follow the same guidelines as those established in local ordinance for regular meetings. There are minimum mandatory notice requirements for certain actions, such as notice of a public hearing on a proposed ordinance, or election notice. There is, however, no specific number of days spelled out in statute that defines \"reasonable.\" The general tone of case law on the subject has essentially found that reasonable notice provides enough notice that a concerned party will have notice of a proposed action within enough time to be involved in the deliberations. This could vary anywhere from three months to three days. The notice also has to provide enough information to let the public know what subjects will be covered in the meeting. If a complete agenda isn't available at the time of posting, a summary will work until the complete agenda is available. Local ordinances should contain all of the requirements for public notice of meetings including what to include in the notice, where the notices are posted, and how soon before the meeting the notices are posted. Where and how does notice have to occur? State law, AS 44.62.310(e), requires that reasonable notice include the date, time, and place of the meeting; and, if by teleconference, the location of any teleconferencing facilities. It also provides that notice may be given in print or broadcast media; that it be posted at the principal office of the public entity or, if no principle office, at a location designated by the governing body; and that it be done in the same way each time \"consistent.\" In addition to the locations required in statute, notice should be posted at well -used locations in the community like the post office, the store, government offices, and the community bulletin board. It may also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the community or broadcast over a local radio station in addition to any other means and locations stated in local ordinance. Are there exceptions to the Open Meetings Act and what subjects may be discussed in executive session? Exceptions to the OMA are discussed in the Executive Session section of LOGON. Is secret ballot voting allowed under the act? Almost always, no. In additi on to requiring that deliberations of a governing body be open to the public, the act also requires that the vote shall be conducted in such a manner that the public may know the vote of each person entitled to vote, including meetings conducted by teleconference. The one exception is organizational meetings of a governing body to elect members to various offices, which are exempted from the requirement that the vote of each member be made public (AS 44.62. 310(a)). Is telephone polling considered a violation of the Open Meetings Act? Whether a phone poll by a member or agent of the governing body would be considered a violation of the act, depends on the subject matter. If the matter involves an administrative or procedural issue that would not warrant public discussion, a phone poll may be conducted. If, however, the phone poll touches on an issue that should be discussed in an open meeting or can have the effect of swaying opinion on a public issue, it could be considered a violation of the act. Who enforces the Open Meetings Act? It is the responsibility of the administration and governing body to assure that the provisions of the Open Meetings Act are enforced. Any individual may contest an action administratively through local channels that they think was done in violation of the Open Meetings Act and ultimately may, within 180 days, file a court action if the issue isn't remedied locally AS 44.62.310(f). There are several court cases that have ruled in favor of the Open Meetings Act. When deciding these cases, the court doesn't just consider whether a violation has occurred, but also considers whether the action has interfered with the public process that the act was intended to protect. www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 4 of 8 What is the cure for a violation of the Open Meetings Act? Actions taken at meetings that are found to be in violation of the Open Meetings Act may be voided. Failing to provide proper notice can cost a great deal of money to defend in addition to the wasted time and effort involved. The governing body can attempt an informal cure by holding another meeting in compliance with the Open Meetings Act and conducting a substantial and public reconsideration of the matters. If a lawsuit is filed, the court may void any action taken by the governing body if the court finds that, considering all of the circumstances, the public interest in compliance with the law outweighs the harm that would be caused by voiding the action AS 44.62.310(f)). In deciding whether to void an action, the court must consider: (1) the expense that may be incurred if the action is voided; (2) the disruption that may be caused if the action is voided; (3) the possibility of additional litigation if the action is voided; (4) the extent to which the subject has previously been considered in compliance with the act; (5) the amount of time that has passed since the action was taken; (6) the degree to which the action has come to be relied on; (7) whether and to what extent the governmental body has, before or after the lawsuit was filed, engaged in or attempted to engage in public reconsideration of the matter; (8) the degree to which the violations were willful, flagrant, or obvious; (9) the degree to which the governing body failed to adhere to the policy under AS 44.62.312 (a). This does not apply to an advisory only body that that has no authority to establish policies and make decisions for the public entity (AS 44.62.310(g)). What effect does attorney client privilege have in dealings between a public entity and its attorney? Executive session procedure requires that the reason for calling the executive session is clearly stated. The attorney - client privilege exemption to the Open Meetings Act is limited to matters where public interest may be injured. This might include how to avoid legal liability, litigation strategies and candid discussion of facts, a proposed settlement conference, and a conference on a decision to appeal. In addition to the rights protected under the Open Meetings Act, what rights can the public expect under state law? In addition to the rights protected under the Open Meetings Act, Title 29 reiterates the requirement that all meetings be open to the public and provides that the public will have the right to be heard at regular and special meetings AS 29.20.020. AS 29.20.160 lays out the procedures that a governing body must follow in conducting its meetings. These procedures include: Provision for identification of the presiding and deputy -presiding officers; The requirement that the governing body hold at least one regular monthly meeting, unless otherwise provided by ordinance; The requirement that the governing body shall provide at least 24-hour notice for special meetings or absent members must waive the notice requirement; Clarification on how actions of the governing body are adopted and what constitutes a quorum; The requirement that all members present shall vote on every question, unless required to abstain; and The requirement that a governing body maintain a journal of its proceedings that is available to the public. AS 29.20.380 assigns certain meeting duties and responsibilities to the municipal clerk. These include: Attendance at public meetings; Keeping the journal; Assuring that notice and other requirements for public meetings are complied with; Assuring that public records are available for public inspection; Managing and maintaining public records; and www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 5 of 8 Preparing agendas and agenda packets. Who enforces the local rules under which a municipality conducts its meetings? Governing bodies must have procedures in place and follow them for their meetings. Some of these procedures are in Title 29 and other statutes. Others are in the local ordinances, which are usually more specific and detailed than Title 29, or in rules of procedure adopted by the governing body. Essentially, the presiding officer enforces the rules by following them when conducting a meeting and, when there is a question of procedure, the clerk, acting as parliamentary advisor, researches the question and proposes an answer, which the presiding officer then rules on. Members of the public also enforce the rules by questioning whenever something occurs that doesn't seem to follow the rules. The last resort for enforcement is a lawsuit.

Government meetings public. (a) All meetings of a governmental body of a public entity of the state are open to the public except as otherwise provided by this section or another provision of law. Attendance and participation at meetings by members of the public or by members of a governmental body may be by teleconferencing. Agency materials that are to be considered at the meeting shall be made available at teleconference locations if practicable. Except when voice votes are authorized, the vote shall be conducted in such a manner that the public may know the vote of each person entitled to vote. The vote at a meeting held by teleconference shall be taken by roll call. This section does not apply to any votes required to be taken to organize a governmental body described in this subsection. (b) If permitted subjects are to be discussed at a meeting in executive session, the meeting must first be convened as a public meeting and the question of holding an executive session to discuss matters that are listed in (c) of this section shall be determined by a majority vote of the governmental body. The motion to convene in executive session must clearly and with specificity describe the subject of the proposed executive session without defeating the purpose of addressing the subject in private. Subjects may not be considered at the executive session except those mentioned in the motion calling for the executive session unless auxiliary to the main question.
