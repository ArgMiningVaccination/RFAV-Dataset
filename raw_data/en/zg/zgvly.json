The historical tale of Tarapith Temple in West Bengal Tarapith Temple is a mysterious place where divine serenity meets special Tantrik insight. The history of the Tarapith Temple is deeply rooted in mythology and ancient legends. According to Hindu mythology, the temple is believed to be the spot where the left eye of Devi Sati, the first wife of Lord Shiva, fell during the cosmic dance of destruction known as the Tandava. This significant event occurred when Lord Shiva was carrying Devi Sati's lifeless body, consumed by grief after her self-immolation. The story begins with the great King Daksha, who organized a grand yajna (sacred fire ritual) and invited all the deities except Lord Shiva. Devi Sati, filled with love and devotion for her husband, could not bear the insult and chose to attend the yajna without an invitation. Upon arriving, she was met with disdain and humiliation from King Daksha. Unable to bear the pain, she immolated herself in the sacrificial fire.
