[Homeopathy](https://www.beyondvetmed.com/blog) Unlike regular medicine, homeopathy treats the WHOLE patient, curing the disease without negative side effects. Homeopathy and chiropractic care has become the cornerstone in my young Samoyed's recovery. Our girl Dylilah was spayed at 16 months. At 20 months, she started to experience occasional incontinence which became much more frequent as time went on. She would void her entire bladder after exercise while sleeping deeply. In just a few weeks, we went from one instance to several per week. After ruling out UTI, our vet diagnosed her with urinary incontinence and indicated we may have to live with this, suggesting Proin. Worried of the side effects, we were heartbroken thinking our young pup would need to be on prescription medications for life. I left the vet determined to find alternative solutions... and my search led me to Dr. Jung. She offered great advice, a logical treatment plan, and realistic expectations. We committed to regular chiropractic visits, complimented with homeopathy. Dr. Jung also supported my additional research of acupuncture and natural supplements, like corn silk. I'm pleased to write we've seen a huge improvement in a short period of time. In the last 4 weeks, just 2 accidents. We are beyond thrilled! And our girl is happier, calmer. Dr. Jung balanced her body's energy, giving her body the power to heal itself. We went from very discouraged pup parents to having our healthy girl back. Thank you Dr. Jung! ~ D. Dobas with Dylilah Dr. Jung is a Godsend. My elderly dog has been seeing her for chiropractic care for years, but it wasn't until my dog randomly lost her ability to walk because her back legs stopped supporting her that Dr. Jung and I discussed homeopathy. I'm so grateful we did. Over the course of 4 days, my dog received acupuncture and chiropractic work; however, the homeopathic remedy Dr. Jung recommended was the heavy hitter. Not only did my dog recover immediately, she never had the problem again. Dr. Jung will remain my go-to for my dogs' care. I highly recommend her to anyone seeking a way to help their fur babies live a healthy happy life. ~ T. Daye with Diamond Dr. Heike Jung, DVM, CAC, C.Vet.Hom. I'm a veterinarian certified by the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association with over 20 years of experience as a veterinary chiropractor. In 2020, I also became certified as a veterinary homeopath by the British Institute of Homeopathy. It would be my pleasure to help your four legged friend and partner move and feel better. Recipient of the \"Gentle Doctor Award\" Dr. Jung has seen Teddy for about a year as a chiropractic client. Teddy was adopted at 2 years old in 2019. He was showing sensitivity with his right hind leg upon first visit with Dr. Jung. Over time Dr. Jung has peeled back the onion with her chiropractic adjustments and has found the root of Teddy's problem. Teddy now does a nice square sit and a nice stand. This is important for his obedience competitions. In addition to being a chiropractic client, Dr. Jung has been helping Teddy manage his separation anxiety. Dr. Jung has partnered with us in finding the correct homeopathic remedy. Teddy is now able to stay at home by himself and greets us at the door with a toy in his mouth and a wagging tale and not stressed. Teddy is very happy to have Dr. Jung as a member of Team Teddy. We were so happy with Dr. Jung's care of Teddy that we have shared her contact information with other rescue dog owners. ~ Cheryl Mathews-White with Teddy Nutrition Proper nutrition is vital to health. Unfortunately most pet foods are calorie rich and nutrient poor. Even the most expensive bagged foods lack nutrition because cooking and processing ingredients, even if they are organic, will leave them rendered void of nutrients. The best you can do for your pet is to switch them to a Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. Use Discount Code \"1612\" Dr. Jung has been a pivotal resource for my dogs over the last several years. I was so thankful to have found her! As a preservation breeder and dog show enthusiast of giant breeds, keeping my dogs in too condition is paramount to their success, longevity and happiness. Whether it be routine adjustments or rehabilitation needs, she has helped so many of my young and older Danes to prosper. Dr. Jung takes great care in understanding each patients needs and provides the owners with detailed reports and recommendations. 5 stars doesn't even begin to articulate the service. Thank you Dr. Jung for all that you have done for us! ~ Danielle Peters and "}
