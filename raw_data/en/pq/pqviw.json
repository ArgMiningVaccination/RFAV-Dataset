Acupuncture is an ancient healing art that has proven its effectiveness throughout the ages. Acupuncture is effective for a variety of problems because it helps to correct the underlying causes of your health problems. Examples of conditions that acupuncture can help: - Back / Neck / Joint Pain - Headaches & Migraines - Fibromyalgia - Insomnia and / or Anxiety - Chronic Pain & Arthritis - Failed Back Surgery Syndrome [Sciatica and Disc Herniations](https://johnson-chiro.com/sciatica) - Past-Due Pregnancy / Facilitate Labor [Infertility](https://johnson-chiro.com/infertility) - Complement a chemotherapy regimen - Many Other Problems... How Does It Work? According to Eastern Medicine, Your body has an Energy, called Qi (chee), that runs through channels called Meridians. If there is a blockage in any of these meridians, it can block the energy flow and cause health problems. Acupuncture needles are inserted into specific points in order to restore the normal Qi, or energy flow. Improved health is the result. Western Medicine states that acupuncture works by blocking pain through release of endorphins, and enhances nerve firing in specific locations of the body and brain. This causes muscle relaxation and an improvement in symptoms. In western medicine, places that are classically referred to as \"acupuncture points\" are referred to as \"myofascial trigger points\". Regardless of how it is explained, needle acupuncture is clinically proven to help over 300 conditions. What Training is Required to Practice Acupuncture? For a Chiropractic Physician to practice acupuncture they first must meet the following requirements: 1)Complete 7-9 years of college, and earn the degree of Doctor of Chiropractic; 2)Pass 5 Chiropractic Boards Exams (Parts I-IV and Part PT); 3)Undergo a minimum of 100 hours of post-doctoral acupuncture training; 4)Pass the NBCE Acupuncture Board Exam, 5)Apply for state licensure and board certification; 6)Keep their license current with mandatory annual continuing education. While there are other types of providers that do perform acupuncture (such as non-physician acupuncturists, and medical doctors with proper training) chiropractors represent the largest number of providers in the state of Missouri that perform acupuncture. How Many Treatments Would I Need? That completely depends on how long you have had your problem and how severe your problem is. Dr. Johnson will create a care plan that will help provide you with the best results based on his clinical experience. Generally, relief begins to become noticed within the first 3-4 visits. What if I am Afraid of Needles? Acupuncture needles are very tiny and should actually be called \"filaments\" because they are nearly as thin as a thread of hair. Unlike hypodermic needles, acupuncture needles produce very little discomfort if any. Most people report \"feeling good\" during and after treatment, similar to how they feel after a massage. Many fall asleep while being treated from being so comfortable. What is My First Acupuncture Visit Like? Your first visit is very similar to the first chiropractic visit. If you are a new patient we will initially ask you to fill out some paperwork. Next, you will meet Dr. Johnson, and he will conduct a consultation, history, and examination that is specific to your health concerns. Then, Dr. Johnson will diagnose your problems, and discuss a treatment plan for you. Next, Dr. Johnson will select specific acupuncture points to treat and will insert needles into those points. The needles will be left in for about 20 minutes depending you and Dr. Johnson's desired treatment length. You will be monitored during this time to ensure that you are as comfortable as possible. After the time has elapsed, the needles will be removed, and Dr. Johnson will discuss with you further treatment plans. This visit typically lasts about 45 min. in length from start to finish. Follow-up acupuncture treatments usually last about 25-30 minutes including prep time. Does Insurance Cover Acupuncture? Although a minority of insurance companies do provide some type of coverage for acupuncture, the vast majority do not cover this beneficial service. It is for these reasons that we do not accept insurance for acupuncture services and will not submit acupuncture to your insurance. Acupuncture must be paid for out-of-pocket by the patient. Should the patient decide that they would like to try to get reimbursed for the acupuncture treatment, they may do so on their own; our clinic will be happy to provide the necessary documentation and receipt for the visit. Your insurance may provide coverage for your initial examination with us on your first acupuncture visit. Exams performed by a chiropractic physician are often covered. Acupuncture is usually not covered, regardless of who may be performing the service (chiropractor, MD, acupuncturist, etc.) It is important to keep in mind that just because your insurance doesn't cover the type of health care you are seeking, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't consider purchasing that service on your own any way. After all, health insurance doesn't cover hardly any thing that many people pay for to improve health and well being. Does your insurance cover purified water, organic food, or gym memberships? Probably not, although it would be smart of them to do so, since money could be saved in the long run by preventing health problems from ever beginning. "}
