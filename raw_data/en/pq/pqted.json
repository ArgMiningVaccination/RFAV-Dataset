Stinging Nettle Stinging nettle, or [Urtica dioica](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/stinging-nettle), is aptly named due to the stinging or burning sensation you get when you brush against the plant's hairy leaves. This bristly plant grows throughout North America and Europe and is often thought of as a weed. Nettle has been used as an herbal panacea for thousands of years because of its dense variety of nutrients. The nettle leaf contains a wide spectrum of vitamins, minerals and polyphenols that support a healthy inflammatory response among other benefits. The baby leaves that grow at the top of the plant in the early spring are used to nourish and detoxify the body. In Ayurveda, nettle is a Rasayana, a nourishing and rejuvenating herb. It is astringent in nature and very pungent. It stimulates the Vata dosha while balancing the Pitta and Kapha doshas. Try making a stinging nettle infusion by adding one ounce of dried nettle leaves (or two ounces of fresh leaves) to four cups of hot water.
