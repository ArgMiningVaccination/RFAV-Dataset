Today, the reversal of age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa are within reach. These and stories about the Institute for Protein Design (page 26), three-dimensional printed organs (page 13), and other previously unimaginable advances speak to the talent, vision and dedication of UW Medicine faculty, as well as the profound influence of the donors who make this work possible. Other stories in this issue are tied to our regional landscape and heritage. The WWAMI program began nearly 45 years ago at the University of Washington School of Medicine to serve the people of the Pacific Northwest. WWAMI's goal is to increase the number of physicians, especially for underserved areas and populations, by providing publicly supported, community-based medical education, emphasizing the importance of primary care and expanding graduate medical education. And WWAMI is committed to achieving this goal in a high-quality, cost-effective manner. Several examples of what WWAMI brings to the region illustrate the program's impact. As a result of partnership, collaboration, vision and talent, Kadlec Regional Medical Center in the Tri-Cities is starting a family medicine residency as part of the UW's Family Medicine Residency Network \u2014 affiliated family medicine residency programs that collaborate throughout WWAMI (page 14). Kadlec's new family medicine program will help to populate the Tri-Cities and central Washington with much-needed physicians. The WWAMI Practice & Research Network, supported by the UW's Institute for Translational Health Sciences and the Department of Family Medicine, brings together nearly 50 primary-care clinics WWAMI-wide to partner on practice-based research that helps elucidate the health needs and concerns of patients and health professionals. See the story on page 16. Donors are a major part of all these successes. Thank you to the individuals and organizations highlighted in this issue \u2014 and many others \u2014 who contribute to groundbreaking research, the landmark WWAMI program, scholarships and patient-care programs in supporting UW Medicine.

It's one of the alumni association's values. Without it, the association would be unable to fulfill its mission, and UW Medicine would not be what it is today. We express our generosity in several ways. Philanthropic giving is one way, of course, and I thank the 2,255 alumni who supported UW Medicine this year. I encourage you to read the Report to Donors section on page 19, which shows the collective impact of our gifts. Time is another form of generosity. It is a gift that can be enormously helpful to students \u2014 opening their eyes to a new specialty or an unexpected career path, welcoming them to a new city, or showing through your actions that a relationship with the UW School of Medicine lasts a lifetime. Alumni in nearly 30 specialties volunteer their time to share a meal with students and discuss life after medical school. Other alumni participate in career panels, help students prepare for residency interviews, serve as preceptors or support service-learning projects. Those living far away contribute, too. Last year, alumni in 23 states and 31 cities offered to host fourth-year students who were traveling for residency interviews, saving students thousands of dollars. By embracing a spirit of generosity, we strengthen our school and our alumni community \u2014 today and for years to come. I encourage you to think about how you might contribute. Then visit the alumni association's website, volunteer for one of our programs, and send me your suggestions and ideas about how we can do more. Or, even better, join us at an upcoming meeting of the Alumni Leadership Council where we can discuss how we, as alumni, can support each other, our students and our trainees in professional and educational endeavors.

Murry, M.D., Res. '92, Ph.D., and Michael Laflamme, M.D., Ph.D., and their colleagues re-ported that they restored damaged heart muscle in monkeys \u2014 using heart cells created from human embryonic stem cells. This study is unprecedented. First, researchers proved that it is possible to produce enough stem cells to attempt to re-muscularize a damaged heart. Second, the study proved that the process of re-muscularization works. On average, transplanted stem cells regenerated 40 percent of the monkeys' damaged tissue. Since the size and physiology of a monkey heart is similar to that of the human heart, these findings suggest the approach should work in people. Murry thinks the approach will be ready to test in humans within four years. Maternal deaths on the rise in the United States The May 2, 2014, issue of The Lancet published reports of two studies by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evalua- tion (IHME). One focuses on the global, regional and national causes of maternal mortality, and the other addresses mor - tality from the neonatal period through age 4, both for the period 1990 to 2013. This first installment in IHME's updates to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study showed that the United States is among just eight countries in the world to experience an increase in maternal mortality since 2003 \u2014 joining Afghanistan and countries in Africa and Central America. A research first: linking a gene mutation to a form of autism UW researchers and collaborators at 13 institutions worldwide are the first to show that a gene mutation can cause a specific type of autism. The finding is a game-changer in studying this disorder, which takes numerous forms and has numerous causative fac- tors. In a study of 6,176 children with autism spectrum disorder, researchers found that 15 had a CHD8 mutation. All had digestive problems, a larger than normal head and wide-set eyes. Raphael Bernier, Ph.D. '07, UW associate profes-sor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and clinical director of the Autism Center at Seattle Children's, is a lead author on the paper, published in Cell. New ways to restore memory UW researchers will play a key role in developing next- generation technolo- gies to restore memory in patients with neurological disorders. That is the goal of a four-year initiative funded by a $22.5 million fed- eral grant. Researchers at seven medical centers, including UW Medical Center, will study patient volunteers with epilepsy and Parkinson's disease who receive safe levels of brain stimulation as part of their treatment. New insights on the neural activity related to memory will lead to the development of systems to electrically stimulate discrete regions of the brain. Elizabeth Buffalo, Ph.D., UW associate professor of physiology and biophysics, leads the multidisciplinary team. Washington Research Foundation takes on major initiatives Washington Research Foundation made a $31.2 million, six-year commitment to promising interdisciplinary initiatives at the University, including the Institute for Protein Design, a field with the potential to revolutionize medicine, energy and technology. The WRF also is supporting the creation of the Institute for Neuro- engineering, which aims to help people affected by neural disorders. Other ben-eficiaries include an initiative in big data, which has implications for fields ranging from medicine to the humanities, and a clean energy institute. New center to examine genital microbiome The University of Washington, in collaboration with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, has been awarded a five-year, $14.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health for a Sexually Transmitted Infections Cooperative Research Center. A team of scientists will use sophisticated laboratory methods to study the genital microbiome and local immune response; scientists hope to devise new strategies to prevent and manage common clinical problems of major health relevance, including bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes and urethritis. Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., Fel.'95, MPH, UW professor of medicine, is the principal investigator; Anna Wald, M.D., MPH, UW professor of medicine, co-directs the eight-member faculty team.

In ad- dition to this high national ranking, UWMC was named the No. 1 hospital in the Seattle metro area and in the state of Washington. U.S. News & World Report rated 4,806 medical centers in 16 specialties, and UWMC stands among the top 10 in three specialties, including rehabilitation medicine (No. 4; this specialty is also located at Harborview Medical Center), cancer (No. 6), and diabetes and endocrinology (No. 10). It also was nationally ranked in another 10 specialties. Other UW Medicine hospi-tals ranked highly as well: Harborview is ranked No. 3 in the Seattle metropolitan region and No. 4 in Washington state; Northwest Hospital & Medical Center is ranked No. 5 in Seattle and No. 7 in the state. Boeing enters into UW Medicine's Accountable Care Network Boeing has joined UW Medicine's newly formed Accountable Care Network. The company is offering the network's healthcare services to some employees beginning in January 2015 through a preferred partnership option. UW Medicine has been preparing for many years to serve as an accountable care organization and is committed to improving the patient experience, achieving better health for patients and reducing costs to improve the value of care. The accountable care network, which includes other regional partners, will focus on keeping people healthy \u2014 and out of the hospital \u2014 by employing evidence-based preventive measures to identify and treat underlying health problems before they become chronic conditions. Education UW Medicine ranked No. 3 in the world UW Medicine is again among the top medicine programs in this year's Academic Ranking of World Universities, issued by the Center for World-Class Universities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. UW Medicine was ranked No. 3 in clinical medicine in 2014, behind Harvard and the University of California, San Francisco, and ahead of Johns Hop-kins University. In addition, the University of Washington was ranked No. 3 in pharmacy and No. 6 in life sciences. Overall, the UW was ranked No. 15 in the world, up from No. 16 in 2013. The UW School of Medicine: No. 1 in the nation In its 2015 rankings of graduate pro- grams, U.S. News & World Report rated the UW School of Medicine the nation's No. 1 medical school for primary care. UW Medicine has held the top primary-care ranking for 19 of the last 20 years. In addition, the school received top-10 marks in seven of the eight other program rankings: family medicine and rural medicine (No. 1 in each category, for the 23rd consecutive year), AIDS (No. 4), pediatrics (No. 5), geriatrics (No. 7), internal medicine (No. 7), and drug and alcohol abuse (tied for No. 9). Among graduate research training programs, the UW School of Medicine was third in the nation in genetics/genomics/ bioinformatics and seventh in bioengi- neering (a joint program of the School of Medicine and the College of Engineering). In addition, the School's faculty were again second in the nation for receipt of funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and first among all public medical schools.On Match Day, students turn to primary care Match Day: it's the day where graduating medical students learn where they'll be completing their residency training. On March 21, 222 medical students graduating this year from the UW School of Medicine matched to residencies in 32 states. Thirty-two percent of students matched into residencies in the WWAMI program, and 56 percent of students are entering primary-care specialties \u2014 far above the national average. The WWAMI program has been very successful in preparing primary-care physicians for our region. New graduate Lisa Sanders, M.D. '14, learns where she'll be completing her residency training. FALL 2014 7< Around UW Medicine: News WWAMI UW School of Medicine in top 10 for training family physicians For the fourth year in a row, the UW School of Medicine is on the American Academy of Family Physicians' list of the top 10 medical schools contrib-uting to the pipeline of family physicians. The top 10 (out of nearly 150 allopathic medical schools) graduated the highest percentage of students who chose first-year family medicine residency positions during a consecutive three-year period. The UW School of Medicine and its WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) program have worked for more than 40 years to develop a ro-bust primary-care workforce \u2014 including family medicine physicians \u2014 to meet the need for care, especially in rural and underserved areas. Preceptor named Idaho Family Physician of the Year A family medicine physician who works with the Idaho WWAMI program was named Idaho Family Physician of the Year by the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians. Frank Batcha, Jr., M.D., Res. '93, who practices in Hailey, was honored for contributions to his profession and to medical education and for his dedication to his community and country. Batcha, a UW clinical assistant professor, teaches UW students and residents to care for patients in rural and underserved areas.Notable Geneticist receives prestigious Lasker Award For decades, geneticist Mary-Claire King, Ph.D., has been on the front lines in the war against cancer as well as in the effort to remedy human rights violations. In September 2014, King received the 2014 Lasker-Koshland Special Achieve-ment Award in Medical Science for \"bold, imaginative and diverse contri- butions to medical science and human rights.\" Often a predictor of future recipients of the Nobel Prize, the Lasker Award is one of the most prestigious awards given to scientists. Dr. King is the sixth UW Medicine-affiliated scientist to be honored by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation. Other honorees include Robert Roeder, Ph.D. (2003), Belding H. Scribner, M.D. (2002), Bertil Hille, Ph.D. (1999), Lee H. Hartwell, Ph.D. (1998), Edwin G. Krebs, M.D. (1989), and Leroy Hood, M.D., Ph.D. (1987).

Bucey Memorial Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology. In 2014, thanks to a collaboration spanning UW Medicine, UC Berkeley and the University of Munich, science fiction has turned into a distinct possibility.EYE RESEARCHERS TAKE ON THE RETINA The mystery, the revelation The retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the inner eye that translates images to the brain \u2014 is something of a mystery. \"No one fully understands the code that the retina uses to communicate with the brain,\" Van Gelder says. What is known is that the millions of cells in the retina are grouped into families that sense and encode different types of information: motion, direction, contrast and radiance, for example. And for two of the diseases that cause retina damage and lead to blind-ness \u2014 age-related macular degenera-tion and retinitis pigmentosa \u2014 there is no cure. At least, not yet. Enter AAQ, a compound that blocks potassium channels, the connectors between cells that, as potassium flows back and forth, allow neurons to communicate. A few years ago, organic chemist Dirk Trauner, Ph.D., modified AAQ to become light-sensitive. He and his colleagues at UC Berkeley \u2014 Richard Kramer, Ph.D., John Flannery, Ph.D., and Ehud Isacoff, Ph.D. \u2014 then conducted an experiment. They put brain tissue in a petri dish, added AAQ and inserted an electrode. The result? They found that AAQ rendered the tissue light-sensitive. They then began experimenting with retinas from blind mice, thinking that AAQ might be able to restore vision. In the meantime, Van Gelder and his colleagues had developed an efficient tool to study and record the activity of many photo receptors at once: multi-array electrodes. When Van Gelder saw Kramer present AAQ findings at a conference, he had a revelation.REVERSINGBLINDNESSFALL 2014 9 < Reversing Blindness \"The little light bulb that went off in my head,\" he says, \"was that our technique would be a very rapid way to demonstrate if AAQ had the potential to restore vision.\" Blind mice begin to see \"I was excited about this project because it was something so new and novel,\" says Jack Sychev, M.D. Now in his fourth year of residency, Sychev had taken off a year from medical school at Washington University in St. Louis to do research in Van Gelder's lab. The UC Berkeley group had already proven that \u2014 in the dish, at least \u2014 a retina from a blind mouse would become light-sensitive if exposed to AAQ. Sychev would be part of the next step: ascertaining if a blind mouse dosed with AAQ would react to light. It worked. Sychev watched and recorded as mouse pupils constricted in response to certain wavelengths of light, an indication that the retina was back online, at least partially. \"The science behind it was sound,\" says Sychev. Still, experimentation can be hit and miss; a plan can look good on paper, but then fail in the lab. Not this time. \"The first time it works, that's kind of marvelous,\" he says. (Learn about Sychev's residency experiences on page 31.)The light switch and the five-year plan What's the science behind the work? \"It's as though Dirk put an on/off switch on AAQ,\" says Van Gelder. Unless it's bathed in the right light, AAQ is inactive; the switch is off. In its first stage of development, green wavelengths put AAQ in the off position; it had no effect on the potas-sium channels it would normally affect. \"But when we put blue light on it, the drug is active. It will find the channel and block it,\" Van Gelder says. And once the channel is blocked, the retina starts \"seeing\" light. As promising as AAQ was, how- ever, it had drawbacks. \"It didn't turn off by itself,\" says Van Gelder, and it needed two types of light to act as trig-gers. Blue: on; green: off. \"That's not going to be very useful in people.\" So the collaboration continues, now expanding to the University of Munich, where Dirk Trauner works. With the support of a Nanotech- nology Roadmap Grant from the National Institutes of Health, Trauner developed second-generation versions of AAQ: DENAQ and PhENAQ. UW Medicine and Berkeley began testing the drugs, and the results are positive. DENAQ is an improvement over AAQ in several ways: it activates \"If looked at through the lens of 100 years ago, this would be pure science fiction.\" \u2014 Russell Van Gelder, M.D., Ph.D. Russell Van Gelder, M.D., Ph.D., takes patient Mark Bathum \u2014 who is enthused about Van Gelder's progress in vision restoration \u2014 on a tour of the lab. Van Gelder holds an amplifier for a multi- electrode array chip, used to measure the light-related responses of the mammalian retina in the laboratory. REVERSINGBLINDNESS Photos: Karen Orders10 UW MEDICINEReversing Blindness > at lower light levels and with both blue and green light; it also responds well to white light. Kramer, Van Gelder, Trauner and collaborators published their results with AAQ and DENAQ in two major papers in the journal Neuron last year. The Paralympian's perspective Mark Bathum is a 55-year-old businessman, a University of Washington alumnus and an award-winning Paralympic skier. He is also one of Van Gelder's patients. Bathum has retinitis pigmentosa. In classic disease progression, Bathum had trouble seeing in the dark as a child; he remembers trick-or-treating forays that left him tripping and stumbling. In later years, vision problems likely cost him a place on the U.S. Ski Team. He can now see only straight in front of him. Bathum has noticed a major shift \u2014 fueled by research \u2014 in how his physicians approached his pros-pects. In the 1980s and 90s, their diag-noses offered little hope beyond disease progression. Things, happily, have changed. \"Since five or 10 years ago,\" Bathum says, \"all the doctors are more optimistic about retina treatments.\" He shares that optimism, and he hopes that Van Gelder's work could arrest or cure his condition. \"It's not that I expect a solution in five years,\" Bathum says. \"But maybe 15.\"The possibilities Using the small-molecule approach \u2014 developing AAQ and its successors \u2014 is only one of a number of promising projects at the UW Medicine Eye Institute. In the effort to defeat blindness, researchers also are pursuing stem cell solutions: growing new, working eye cells, then transplanting them into the eye to replace non-working tissue. Another group is developing mini-mally invasive techniques to introduce gene therapy vectors into the eye, with the aim to fix faulty photoreceptors. That said, Van Gelder and his col- leagues are invested in DENAQ and the compounds that are likely to fol-low. A chemical solution has decided benefits over, say, a prosthetic eye implant (even with current technol-ogy, the resolution is low) or a genetic modification (which offers only one opportunity to fix the problem). In contrast, drugs can be modified and improved, so that patients can start a treatment, then upgrade as the medica-tion is upgraded. \"I was excited about this project because it was something so new and novel.\" \u2014 Jack Sychev, M.D.Even now, DENAQ and PhENAQ are being refined. The compounds need to be made more soluble, so that they are easier to deliver to the eye, and they need to be tested for toxicity. The end goal, of course, is to help the millions of people affected by macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa worldwide. Van Gelder cautions that this work may not come to fruition. But he's still optimistic, and he even gives an estimate for how long it will take until a compound is ready to test in humans. \"As a scientist, I'm naturally skepti- cal,\" says Van Gelder. \"But barring the unforeseen...I'd say that a five-year time window is reasonable.\" More online \u00bb Read more about Mark Bathum's Olympic and Paralympic aspirations at uwmedmagazine.org.FALL 2014 11 You could say that John Betz, PA-C (Seattle Class 1), heralded the beginning of a grand experi- ment for the UW School of Medicine. And for patients in Othello, Wash. And, not least, for two Othello physicians: Richard Bunch, M.D., and Kenneth Pershall, M.D. In the 1960s, Bunch and Pershall were stretched thin from caring for the growing population of Othello \u2014 nearly 200 miles away from Seattle and 100 miles from Spokane. \"We found ourselves up day and night trying to care for people, and we could not get help to do it,\" says Bunch. The brand-new MEDEX Northwest program offered a potential solution to the dire lack of medical professionals: John Betz and fellow classmate Paul Snyder. The two men were part of MEDEX's first class, the brainchild of MEDEX founder Richard Smith, M.D., and they were slated to spend a clinical year in Othello. Bunch and Pershall were to act as mentors. Initially, the two physicians thought they'd just ask the fledgling PAs to help handle patient overflow. What happened, instead, was that both Betz and Snyder secured panels of patients. \"I developed a group of patients that I loved, and they put up with me,\" says Betz. \"Everybody had a full schedule.\"Learning by doing, that was the rule for the two students. The grand experiment proved so successful that Betz came back to work at the 14th Avenue Clinic, spending 44 years in medical service and becoming a part of many families' lives. Betz also became an influential part of the life of Annie Coronado, PA-C (Yakima Class 18). Coronado met Betz while she was an R.N. at the clinic. \"I was immediately impressed with Annie's depth of understanding and the fact that she identifies well with patients,\" Betz says. One day, Betz popped the question: would Coronado take over his practice when he retired? \"I had to think, 'I'm not going to live forever,'\" he says. \"And our patients had such confidence in her.\" The decision to go back to school to become a PA wasn't easy for Coronado. She sat down with Betz a few times to discuss it. \"Do you think I can do this?\" Coronado recalls asking. \"And, of course, he said, 'Oh, yeah, you can do it. You're smart. You can do Passing the Torch in Othello, Wash. JOHN BETZ AND ANNIE CORONADO anything.' He's always held me up on this pedestal.\" After graduation, Coronado returned to Othello, now working at the 14th Street Clinic's sister site, the Columbia Basin Health Associa-tion Clinic. On day one, she started with a full schedule, no openings. \"It was just a shock. I just couldn't believe that patients were waiting for me to come back to work,\" she says. Today, Betz is retired, having passed the torch to Coronado. He leaves behind a legacy: hundreds of lives touched, 70-some PA students mentored and, not least, the sure knowledge that physician assistants make a tremendous difference in bringing healthcare to rural areas. These accomplishments are not lost on Coronado, who's making her own way as Betz's successor. To this day, she tells patients that Betz left some huge shoes to fill. They reply, \"Honey, he's had 40-some years on you. You'll get there.\" See more about John Betz's story as a rural PA at depts.washington.edu/medex.< MEDEX Northwest.

Photo courtesy of MEDEX Northwest FALL 2014 1112 UW MEDICINE Top of Mind > Epidemiologist. Academic. Mayor of Cali, Colombia (twice). And, most recently, the inaugural winner of the Roux Prize. This is the highly accomplished and inventive Rodrigo Guerrero, M.D., Ph.D. Created by David and Barbara Roux, the annual Roux Prize rewards people like Guerrero: innovative thinkers and doers who are using data on global health trends \u2014 from malaria, to maternal health, to heart attacks, to automobile accidents \u2014 to change lives in their communities. \"I am a strong believer that education in the hands of the community is a powerful thing,\" says Guerrero. And that's exactly what the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is intended to do: make health evidence available to all. A mammoth and constantly refreshed record of worldwide health trends, and a global collaboration effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, the GBD provides the findings that allow policymakers to use scarce health resources wisely. It's not surprising that the inaugural Roux Prize was given to Guerrero: he and IHME share a strong belief in data's ability to solve nearly intractable problems. When Guerrero first became mayor of Cali, Colombia, in 1992, the epidemiologist immediately began to quantify Cali's high murder rate. He and his colleagues realized early on that drug-related violence, assumed to be the cause of the murder rate, was not the sole reason for the deaths. Rather, it was a volatile cultural mixture. His team tracked who was committing the murders (young men), their timing (certain holidays and payroll Fridays), and the place (often in parks and other public spaces). \"People have money in their pockets, they go out and drink, and there is an epidemic of death,\" Guerrero says. Once they understood the cause of the murder rate, he and his administration engaged the community in understanding the connection between drinking and violence, and they in-stituted laws that reduced it. But subsequent mayors did not enforce these laws or study the data as rigorously as Guerrero did. Several administrations later, in 2011, Guerrero was re-elected as mayor of Cali and is now re-addressing the city's problem with violence. In doing so, the epidemiologist has another tool at his disposal: information from the GBD. \"I'm benefiting from the data that the global forum has made available to preach the need for the prevention of violence,\" Guerrero says. The mayor isn't just crunching numbers \u2014 he and his staff are creating infrastructure that will improve population health. To make parks safer and more welcoming, encourag-ing physical activity by families and neighborhood residents, Guerrero's administration is planting trees, improving play-ing fields and installing lights in parks. Now that the homicide rate is once again dropping in Cali, Guerrero is turning his attention to other public health problems. \"Complications of chronic diseases, hypertension, diabetes \u2014 hospitals are flooded with these,\" he says. \"These are diseases that can be prevented by education, opportuni-ties, changing eating habits. I see the future of public health in Cali moving in this direction.\" Watch IHME's video on Guerrero: visit YouTube; search for \"Roux Prize.\"CALI MAYOR ADDRESSES VIOLENCE, AWARDED THE ROUX PRIZE In creating the Roux Prize, David and Barbara Roux hope that inno- vators such as Rodrigo Guerrero, M.D., Ph.D. (pictured), will inspire others to use data to improve health around the globe.

Loaded with frustration and determination, that realization has inspired count- less technological advances from Bronze Age tools to cell phones. At UW Medicine, the desire for a better way has inspired the use of 3D hearts \u2014 hearts that are exact replicas of those found beating in patients' chests. Stephen Seslar, M.D., Ph.D., and Kristen Patton, M.D., both associate professors of medicine in the Division of Cardiology, are electrophysiologists or EPs, specialists in diagnosing and treating electrical problems in the heart. \"EPs must complete two years of advanced fellowship training following their cardiology fellowship,\" Patton says. In that time, fellows learn to guide catheters through the chambers of the heart, using 3D fluoroscopy imaging and mapping software. But you can't cover every situation in training. \"It took me another five years as an attending to be truly comfortable doing complex procedures,\" Seslar adds. \"And you still can't practice for one-of-kind cases in which patients have unusual abnormalities.\" There must be a better way to be prepared for heart procedures, they thought. And after they crossed paths with Tom Burke, a local engineer who could print 3D organs, they found their answer. Now in the prototype stage, their HeartMAP Simulator allows EPs to practice guiding cath-eter probes through a heart model made of a hydrogel. Burke and his team tested five materials before finding one that wouldn't tear and that felt just like probing a real heart. The material is a proprietary secret.Seslar used the device to practice on a replicated heart, that of a young woman with a congenital abnormality. Then he performed the procedure. \"The real procedure had a good outcome, in part because we understood the anatomy,\" Seslar says. \"I felt like I had been there before.\" UW Medicine's Institute for Simulation and Interprofes- sional Studies, by Brian Ross, Ph.D., M.D. '83, Res. '87, UW professor in anesthesiology, provided guidance for building the simulator and preparing training curricula, and he created an informational video. The team also will work with the UW Center for Commercialization on licens-ing the equipment and training programs. \"Our next step is to conduct a validation study to compare different procedural training methods and then secure a grant to conduct a multi-center trial,\" Patton says. \"We see huge opportunities for improving EP training. It's great timing because medicine is looking for better ways to assess risks and physician competency to improve patient safety and quality of care.\" Visit depts.washington.edu/isisinfo/EP/ for the HeartMAP Simulator instructional video.

The impetus behind the new program? Carrasco is well aware that many baby boom physicians in Washington \u2014 and all over the country \u2014 are going to retire fairly soon. Which means even fewer physicians for rural areas, like the ones around Richland. Suzanne Allen, M.D., vice dean for regional affairs, says UW Medicine has been making \"a very concerted effort to increase the number of residency programs.\" Her reasoning is the same as Carrasco's: a looming shortage of physicians. Increasing the number of seats in medical schools isn't enough; the number of residency slots \u2014 training spaces around the country where newly minted physicians learn their chosen specialties \u2014 are the other half of the equation. By 2017, Allen says, we'll have more graduating medical students than first-year residency positions. This is why Allen and her colleagues are looking for partners like Kadlec to train residents; since 2010, the UW School of Medicine has had two GME summits to encourage hospitals and clinics to become residency sites. The results are good: a family medicine residency at Kadlec, a psychiatry residency in Spokane and new programs in Puyallup and Tacoma. There also are new programs in Montana, Idaho and Alaska. What's the benefit to the community? It's likely that residents will stick around. \"If you look at national data, you're much more likely to stay within a 100-mile radius of your residency,\" says Allen. This is what Richland-area physicians are counting on. It also explains some of their enthusiasm to join the program and teach. \"Physicians from all specialties were calling me and saying 'I want to be involved,'\" says Carrasco. One of these physicians, Erick Isaacson, M.D. '78, FAAFP , shares in all the excitement; in fact, he's the residency's new director. What's more, he's not only an alumnus of the UW School of Medicine, but also of Kadlec: he was born at the medical center some 60 years ago. (Isaacson is profiled on the next page.) \"The need in our region for primary care \u2014 WWAMI in general, southeast Washington in particular \u2014 exceeds our current GME resources,\" says Isaacson, a family medicine physician. \"I've been a physician for more than 33 years, and developing this residency and teaching seems to be the perfect thing to do next.\" CREATING DOCTORS FOR WASHINGTON STATE Photo courtesy of Kadlec Regional Medical Center 14 UW MEDICINEFALL 2014 15 < Top of Mind Residencies for WWAMI Residencies \u2014 the years of intensive training in which M.D.s focus on a specialty such as surgery, pediatrics or family medicine \u2014 are part of the process of becoming a physician. Today, there aren't enough residency slots in hospitals and other patient-care sites to keep up with the national demand for physicians. And creating residency slots is no simple matter. The challenge. Healthcare institutions are paid to support residencies, and the money comes through Medicare and Medicaid. Unfortunately, the funding level was capped in 1997, and residency programs are expensive: $1 or $2 million a year. Communities that want residents can't always afford the program. The urban-rural divide. Institutions only get paid if a resident works in the institution, usually located in a town or city. So while the U.S. needs more physicians in rural areas, it's hard to get funding for rural residencies. What UW Medicine is advocating for in Washington, D.C. A new funding model, with Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WWAMI) serving as the pilot program. The money would follow the resident; fund- ing would be distributed to potential residency sites based on the workforce needs of the community. WWAMI Alumnus Trains His Successors Erick Isaacson, M.D. '78, FAAFP , was born at Kadlec Regional Medical Center in Richland, Wash. Now, as Kadlec's new family medicine residency director, he's going to teach there, too. Below is his story. After arriving at Whitman College for my freshman year, I ex-perienced a crisis of self-confidence. It was clear the pre-med students were a confident and competitive group. At the end of my sophomore year, though, I realized that I was as capable as they were, so I took pre-med prerequisites. Then I entered medical school at the UW School of Medicine; WWAMI had been up and running for about two years. It was such a standout concept. WWAMI made me realize I wanted to pursue family medicine, but I have to credit my family physi- cian, another UW School of Medicine alumnus, for pulling me back to the Richland area. Norman Erie, M.D. '58, was a great encouragement to me in my pre-med studies, and we had kept in contact throughout my medi-cal training. As I was looking for a place to practice, he was looking for a full-time partner. I was thrilled at the chance to work with him, and my wife and I were committed to returning to the Pacific Northwest to be near family and friends. I have been in practice for more than 33 years, and with some fami- lies, I take care of four generations. I've also cared for friends I have known since childhood, classmates, former teachers and mentors. Family medicine is all about continuity of care for patients. And now, with the new residency at Kadlec, I'm training physicians to take my place in this community. Photo courtesy of Kadlec Regional Medical Center FALL 2014 1516 UW MEDICINEWalt Hollow, M.D. '75, is admired for leading in a traditional way: with humility and grace, strength and compassion. He's shown here discussing a patient's chest X-ray with Brooke Parker, M.D. (off camera), a first-year family medicine resident. A calming presence, a great teacher, always willing to help students. That's how Hailey Wilson, M.D. '14, now a family medicine resident, de-scribes Walter Hollow, M.D. '75, the first Native American to graduate from the UW School of Medicine. \"I first heard about Dr. Hollow when he was medical director at the Nez Perce Nimiipuu Health Center in northern Idaho,\" Wilson recalls. \"After I graduated from Boise State, he hired me as a patient educator, then urged me to apply to medical school. He's been a wonderful mentor.\" To honor Hollow's efforts to im- prove healthcare for Native Americans and to mentor students locally and nationally, the Washington Academy of Family Physicians (WAFP) honored Hollow with a 2014 Family Medicine Educator of the Year Award. The award also celebrates Hollow's efforts to es-tablish innovative education programs Top of Mind > We know that a lot of clinical research occurs in academic health centers,\" says Allison Cole, M.D., MPH, assistant professor in the Department of Family Medicine, \"but most patient care occurs in community-based settings.\" A fruitful partnership that brings academia and the community together: that's the rationale behind the WWAMI Region Practice & Research Network (WPRN). \"Doing more research in real-world settings helps ensure the research is applicable to real-world patients,\" says Cole. The WPRN, supported by the Institute of Translational Health Sciences and the Department of Family Medicine, consists of nearly 50 primary-care clinics in Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho, and its goals are twofold: to make sure the best healthcare is available in communities across the region and nation and to understand what's important to patients and healthcare providers. A real-world study of cell phone use Amy Bauer, M.D., M.S., UW assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, recently conducted a study with the WPRN. She wanted to determine how and if patients used cell phones to access health information, and she sur - veyed 918 patients from WPRN clinics in four states. Here are her answers to our questions. Why partner with the WPRN? The WPRN serves a large region, including many rural and underserved areas. It was important to work with clinics outside Seattle to better under - stand broad patterns of use. Also, most REAL-WORLD RESEARCH: CELL PHONES AND PATIENT CARE treatment for mental disorders, here and abroad, takes place in primary-care clinics. What were the study's big takeaways? Fifty-five percent of the patients we surveyed owned smart phones, and 70 percent of those patients use mobile health tools like WebMD. Despite concerns about a digital divide, we found that smart-phone ownership and mobile health tools use were comparable regardless of race/ethnicity, health literacy, chronic diseases or depression. Did anything surprise you? Few patients felt it was important that their primary-care provider know that they used mobile health tools. Less than 10 percent reported that their provider had recommended one. We also found that disease-specific tools (e.g., for managing diabetes or depression) were rarely cited by patients as their favorite. How are you distributing your findings? We presented initial find-ings at the WPRN annual meeting in March 2014, and my next step is to discuss data and impressions with each clinic involved in the study. We also presented findings at two medical conferences, and we have a manuscript being published soon in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine. What did the findings suggest? That people are willing to use mobile apps to find health information, but that we need to maximize the technol-ogy's potential to help manage chronic diseases, including depression and anxiety. I hope this research encourag-es providers, patients, researchers and technology developers to collaborate. AN ELDER, A LEADER, AN ALUMNUS: WALT HOLLOW, M.D. '75 \"FALL 2014 17< Top of Mind A FORCE FOR GOOD JAMIE L. GARCIA, M.D. '99 A high-school dropout, a professional musician, a UW School of Medicine graduate and an advocate for the poor. That was Jamie Lynn Garcia, M.D. '99, the founder of the Pomona Community Health Center in Pomona, Calif. Her patients knew her as Dr. Jamie. Garcia left a musical career in her late twenties to attend UCLA, where she earned a degree in philosophy and ethics. After pursuing a medical degree at the UW School of Medicine, she decided to practice family medicine and began a residency at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center (PVHMC) in 2000. Low-income patients, she saw, were using the emergency room to get care for chronic conditions. Garcia was moved to do something about it. First, Garcia partnered with PVHMC and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to create a small free clinic for homeless people, the uninsured and the under-insured. Then she set her sights on another goal: transforming that clinic into a larger, better equipped center that could help more people. Seed funding was awarded in April 2010. Unfortunately, Garcia was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer five months later. Garcia died in July 2012, the same month the new Pomona Community Health Center opened, but her spirit lives on in the bricks and mortar. \"It's a beautiful facility and a little light in an impoverished community,\" says interim CEO Carmen Angulo. \"We treat everyone the same way, with dignity.\" Today, Pomona has two sites and a staff of about 23 people, and the patient population has doubled over the past year. Angulo estimates that the center will serve about 3,000 people, predominantly Latino, in 2014. Other advances: Pomona can now treat children, in addition to adults. And, thanks to government and foundation funding, staff will soon install an electronic medical records system. \"Dr. Jamie was a force,\" says Angulo. \"The mission that she founded in her heart \u2014 her legacy \u2014 will continue because our staff have that same passion and commitment to this community.\"for Native healthcare professionals, notes Leo Morales, M.D. '90, Ph.D., FACP , director of the School's Center for Health Equity, Diversity and Inclu-sion (CEDI). \"Dr. Hollow continues to be an ally and supporter of our efforts to recruit Native students and to ad-dress the health needs of Native people in our region,\" Morales says. Hollow was active on the Seattle Indian Health Board (SIHB) and UW Medicine's clinical faculty, establishing family medicine residency rotations for physicians who wanted to work in Indian health. While with the School's Office of Multicultural Affairs (now CEDI), he obtained a federal grant to create the Native American Center of Excellence, serving as direc-tor for 10 years. \"Dr. Hollow emphasized that traditional medicine is a vital partner to Western healthcare for Native patients,\" says Terry Maresca, M.D., a UW Medicine clinical faculty member who works with the SIHB and the Puyallup Tribal Authority. \"He put the UW School of Medicine on the map nationally as a magnet for Native students.\" Hollow also created UW Medicine's Indian Health Pathway, an important curricular innovation that allows students of all backgrounds to learn how to work more effectively with Native patients. More than 75 medical students have received pathway certificates, and Hollow still serves as a preceptor. \"Indian health status is the lowest of any American minority group. Pneumonia, homicide, suicide, diabetes and chronic liver disease are the top five causes of mortality,\" says Hollow. \"The pathway curriculum teaches strategies for treating these problems and helps future physicians prepare for working successfully in Indian country.\" 18 UW MEDICINE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR MISSION Student Voices > Juan Maga\u00f1a, MHA, shown here with his mother, remembers the advice his parents gave him and his siblings: \"be good kids, do honest work, never forget where you come from, and be the best at whatever you do.\" He's taken that advice. A fourth-year medical student, Maga\u00f1a has won numerous awards for leadership and service. RAISING THE BAR: Medical Student Juan Maga\u00f1a 18 UW MEDICINEThen came a momentous decision: where to attend medical school? Maga\u00f1a wanted to go where he could continue mentoring younger students, especially minority students inter - ested in the health sciences. Although he had been accepted at several schools, Carol Teitz, M.D., Res. '80, associate dean for admissions, convinced him the UW School of Medicine was the place to come and \"shake things up.\" Teitz was convincing, he recalls, and the UW was attractive for another reason. \"I could learn about underserved communities from different regions and see how care is coordinated over a vast geographic area,\" says Maga\u00f1a. His medical-school experience has turned him into an unabashed advocate for the \"awesome\" region served by the WWAMI program, as well as for Harbor - view Medical Center. Maga\u00f1a's eventual goal is to practice internal medicine in an underserved area, perhaps as a hospitalist; he notes that schol-arship awards reduced his student loan bur - den, allowing him to pursue primary care. For now, he's keeping busy. Maga\u00f1a is a student representative on the School's admissions committee and a leader in numerous campus and community diversity programs. He also mentors a handful of UW undergrads. He's won five service awards and election to the UW chapter of the Gold Humanism Honor Society. Most meaningful to Maga\u00f1a \u2014 \"super huge\" \u2014 was receiving the UW School of Medicine's 2012 Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Service Award. \"I'm just a kid who was given an opportu- nity,\" Maga\u00f1a says. \"The School gave me a chance, and I want to help level the playing field and give more students who come from similar backgrounds an opportunity to fulfill their own dreams and passions.\"Fourth-year medical student Juan Maga\u00f1a, MHA, has seen a great deal during rotations throughout the five-state WWAMI region. Still, a stint in August at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage left him stunned. \"It was astonishing to see just how far Native Alaskans had to travel to receive specialty and intensive care,\" says Maga\u00f1a. \"Considering that Alaska is twice the size of Texas, patients who are flown in from remote villages by plane are instantly separated from their family, community and support system.\" Even more amazing were the streams of people who traveled long distances to visit patients. \"It wasn't just close family mem-bers...extended family ties and uncondi-tional love are extremely strong. Patients in the intensive care unit rarely spend a night alone,\" Maga\u00f1a explains. \"If you just get caught up in the pathology, you may miss seeing the culture and its strengths; you'll miss out on the whole community.\" Culture and family are central to Maga\u00f1a's life, too. Lack of access to health services when he was growing up and helping care for his severely ill grandfather sparked his interest in medicine. Still, Maga\u00f1a thought he wouldn't be able to go to college, much less medical school; children from his com-munity \u2014 Boronda, near Salinas, Calif. \u2014 are lucky to graduate from high school. Then he learned that his grades qualified him for tuition assistance in the California system. Maga\u00f1a attended UC Berkeley, where he was given exceptional support by diversity programs. After earning a degree in public health, he dedicated three years to mentoring underrepresented students in the biological sciences as a student counselor for the Biology Scholars Program at UC Berkeley. FALL 2014 19REPORT TO DONORS YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR MISSION 2013-201420 UW Medicine REPORT TO DONORS 2013-2014 I recently took on the role of chief advancement officer at UW Medicine. As you might expect, I have been busy meeting UW Medicine's faculty and friends, learning more about this world-class institution and simply getting the lay of a complex and integrated landscape. One thing has become abundantly clear in my first two months: UW Medicine is a phenomenal place. And it is phenomenal, in part, because of the gifts of generous and visionary alumni, organizations and friends \u2014 some of which are explored on the following pages. Take, for instance, the partnership between the Life Sciences Discovery Fund and contributors to the Institute for Protein Design on page 26. It's a textbook example of the effectiveness of public-private partnership. Other stories will remind you of the power of community, the loyalty of our alumni and the dedication of our students and faculty.

Justin Fallstrom is a Harborview insider. Not a patient. Not quite a staff member. But an integral part of the medical center, nonetheless. In 2005, Fallstrom began a three-year project with Turner Construction, super - vising remodeling of Harborview Medical Center's Emergency Department and a seismic upgrade to the east wing. \"That first day was eye-opening,\" he says. \"I saw people coming in with severe problems and no place else to go.\" Fallstrom, whose father was deputy chief in a King County fire district, was familiar with emergency response work. He'd heard stories and seen emergency vehicles. \"Now I learned what happened after the patients reach Harborview,\" Fallstrom says. One day, he remembers, after a shooting in downtown Seattle, the injured were transported to Harbor - view. News helicopters hovered over - head, and police rushed in to secure the building. \"The Emergency Department response was extremely systematic and impressive,\" he recalls.When the remodeling project fin- ished, Fallstrom went to work for McKin- stry, a construction company; he's in the division responsible for mechanical and electrical system improvements related to energy efficiency and redundancy. His as-signment: Harborview. Fallstrom ensures that Harborview's ventilation fans and other critical infrastructure equipment work as well and efficiently as possible, all in the effort to reduce the risk of failures that could impact care. Over time, the care given to people from all walks of life, many poor and in dire need, has made a deep impression on Fallstrom. \"Staff members approach every patient without preconceived notions,\" he says. \"I've seen families come every day over many weeks because they don't want to leave a loved one's bedside. It's so difficult for those who don't have a place to stay or money to pay for that.\"Fallstrom saw an opportunity to make a difference. Some years ago, he received a trust fund from a great uncle, and he decided to support causes he cares about. Last December, he made a gift to the medical center's Mission of Caring Fund, which helps the UW Physicians and staff who work at Harborview provide exceptional care to everyone, regardless of their financial circumstances. It's what Harborview believes in. And it's what Fallstrom, a Harborview insider, believes in, too. \"I didn't want to work anywhere else,\" he says, \"and I hope to be here for a long, long time.\" Photo: David Wentworth Photography EYES OPENED AND HEART, TOO An insider's experience at Harborview EYES OPENED AND HEART, TOO An insider's experience at Harborview UW Medicine YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR MISSION 23 The place where medical student Sierra McCreery grew up, Twin Falls, Idaho, is surrounded by miles of farm country. As a phlebotomist at the local hospital, McCreery noticed that rural patients would delay getting care \u2014 and the accompanying 30- or 40-mile drive \u2014 until their condition required emergency treatment. \"If there were just one doctor willing to work in that rural area,\" says McCreery, \"that kind of thing could have been avoided.\" It's a familiar scenario to alumnus Lawrence L. Knight, M.D. '58. A rancher's son, he grew up in a small town in Idaho. He remembers physicians being overworked and spread too thin. \"Appropriate access to medical care was hard to come by,\" he says. Knight, a pathologist, has spent a good part of his career trying to encour - age physicians to practice in Idaho. For years, he was a preceptor for medical students and residents as part of the UW School of Medicine's five-state WWAMI program \u2014 an educational system that trains students from the region for the region. Not long ago, Knight and his wife, Kaye, made another commitment to stu-dents: they've decided to contribute part of their estate \u2014 their IRA account \u2014 to the University of Washington. Eventually, the IRA will create an endowed scholar - ship for medical students from Idaho. \"WWAMI has opened a remarkable opportunity to very committed, well-qualified Idaho students,\" he says. \"It's been a huge benefit to our state and our region, because it's been shown that a significant number of them return here to practice.\"McCreery certainly intends to, perhaps as a pediatrician. Now in her second year, she remembers working through college \u2014 and afterwards \u2014 to finance her education. As the recipient of a scholarship, she understands the value of the Knights' contribution. \"I come from a working-class family, and they can't help me out,\" she says. \"The scholarship I'm given is such a gift.\" As for Knight, he feels a great deal of pleasure in leaving a legacy for students like McCreery. \"A lot of people leave decision-making to their heirs,\" he says. \"I'd like to know a little ahead of time that what Kaye and I have worked for is going to something we care about.\" Sierra McCreery is a second-year scholarship student and Idaho native \u2014 just the kind of student alumnus Lawrence L. Knight, M.D. '58, and his wife, Kaye, want to support. McCreery loves water-based sports, and she's shown here at Green Lake in Seattle, a short walk from her new digs.

The path of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia is all too familiar: forgetfulness, medical diagnosis and evaluation, then disease progression. \"In the past, the person might be institu-tionalized, and they'd drop off the map medically,\" says Grabowski. They can be, in a word, forgotten. Richard Ferry objects to this willful disregard. \"We can't forget or ignore them,\" he says. \"We have to find a way to give them a life. They need our help now.\" Ferry's stake in the issue is personal; his wife, Maude, now 76, began expe- riencing memory loss five years ago \u2014 after the couple retired and moved north to Seattle. \"In the early stages, we did everything we planned to do,\" he says. Now that the early stages have passed, he and his family have questions. \"How do we engage her? How do we give her peace and calm? And how do we bring her joy and happiness?\" Ferry asks. The answer may lie in a changing understanding of Alzheimer's and other dementias, says Grabowski. First, de- mentia takes root early, before symptoms appear. \"It's abundantly clear that what people are doing in mid-life affects their susceptibility,\" he says. (His suggestions: stimulate your brain, stay fit and be socially active.) Second, dementia spares some brain areas and capacities \u2014 such as the areas that allow people to develop skills and habits \u2014 allowing physicians and others to think differently about how patients can be reached and treated. Grabowski also quotes one of the field's mantras: \"engagement is therapy.\" And that's at the core of what he and Richard Ferry are trying to achieve. More activities and therapies to engage people with dementia in an informed way. And more engagement between UW Medicine's Memory and Brain Wellness Center and community organizations that help older people.The center's team of specialists is ready to provide activities that help train the memory, focus on acquiring skills and habits, encourage fitness (for brain and body), and promote social engagement. In turn, Ferry has committed to funding an outreach coordinator for the center. This staff member will contact families affected by dementia as well as senior living centers, allowing UW Medicine's expertise in dementia care to make its way into the community. It's a matching gift, because Ferry isn't content with just making a contribution. He wants people to join him in something he finds tremendously important. \"UW Medicine has the potential to be an international leader in diagnosing, treating and caring for neurodegenerative disorders,\" Ferry says. Potential \u2014 and the conviction that it's the right thing to do. \"We have to recognize that indi- viduals with dementia are real, living people,\" says Ferry. Photo: David Wentworth PhotographyRichard Ferry (right), founder chairman of Korn Ferry International, and Tom Grabowski, Jr., M.D., UW professor in the Department of Radiology and the Department of Neurology, are partners in caring for people with dementia \u2014 and caring for them in a different, better way. \"Tom is committed to making it happen,\" says Ferry. \" FORGET-ME-NOT A new approach to dementia FORGET-ME-NOT A new approach to dementia UW Medicine YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR MISSION 25 We look at a pretty cool class of ion channels that regulates the rhythmic firing of neurons in the heart and the brain,\" says Sackler Scholar Hannah DeBerg, Ph.D. She's measuring the distances between segments in an ion channel \u2014 a type of protein structure \u2014 in order to understand its function. The regular way scientists determine protein structure \u2014 crystallization \u2014 often doesn't work with ion channels. What's more, crystallization may not accurately capture the structure an ion channel adopts in the cell membrane. So DeBerg and University of Washington mentors William Zagotta, Ph.D. (physiol- ogy and biophysics), and Stefan Stoll, Ph.D. (chemistry), are taking a different tack. Their electron tags act as tiny mag-nets, and by measuring the pull between the magnets, they can assess the shape of the ion channel and how it works. \"If you know what something really looks like,\" says DeBerg, \"you can then design small molecules that can bind to it and change its function.\" Small mole-cules that, for instance, could modify the beat of a malfunctioning heart.This cross-pollination of ideas be- tween the sciences is what the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation intended when they created the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Scholars Program in Integrative Biophysics at the University of Washington. Sackler projects bring together mentors from two disciplines to work with a junior scientist. \"Our foundation is focusing on convergence science to explore the inte-gration of physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology,\" says Raymond Sackler, M.D., founder. \"The 12 pro-grams we fund, all at leading universities, have the freedom to structure programs that best achieve their goals. The twin- mentor idea at the University of Wash-ington has been a wonderful success.\" Like DeBerg, Sackler Scholar Braden Brinkman, Ph.D., has two mentors. With his mentors, Fred Rieke, Ph.D. (physiology and biophysics) and Eric Shea-Brown, Ph.D. (applied mathemat-ics), and graduate student Alison Weber, Brinkman is constructing models of computational circuits based on the retina: how signals come in, what chan-nels the signals activate, how \"noise\" in the system affects the process. More broadly, they're trying to figure out how a neural system receives information and encodes it for the brain, research that someday may have implications for conditions like epilepsy. \"It's been great having Eric's and Fred's perspectives,\" says Brinkman. He also enjoys the Sackler Scholars' lunches, where the fellows talk shop and social-ize. \"You never know where a great idea is going to come from...I think that's really important to help foster these ideas,\" he says. \"Being able to work on something new \u2014 that's pushing the boundaries and combining techniques and biological systems in new ways \u2014 has been a lot of fun,\" says DeBerg. \"And the Sackler fel-lowship is really designed to support this type of research.\" Post-docs Hannah DeBerg, Ph.D., and Braden Brinkman, Ph.D., pictured on the University of Washington's Seattle campus, are Sackler Scholars. \"No other university has a collaborative, interdisciplinary postdoctoral program like this one,\" says Stanley C. Froehner, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and director of the Sackler Scholars Program. \"Biophysics is spread across cam-pus, and the Sackler program provides a nucleation point that has generated produc-tive collaborations, new grants and joint publications.\"Photo: David Wentworth Photography THE NEXT GREAT IDEA Where the sciences converge \" THE NEXT GREAT IDEA Where the sciences converge26 UW Medicine REPORT TO DONORS 2013-2014 When you meet a brilliant vision- ary like David Baker, you can't stand by and just say, 'Oh, cool,'\" says Lyn Grinstein. \"We knew that it would be an incredible privilege to get involved and help make it happen.\" What Lyn and Jerry Grinstein and other contributors became involved in was this: a challenge to help raise $4 million for Baker and his colleagues at the Institute for Protein Design (IPD). Secure that, and Washington state's Life Sciences Discovery Fund (LSDF) would provide an additional $1.4 million. Within six months, they met the challenge, and together, these resources have established a translational research program at the IPD. In supporting this program, donors are helping underwrite the work that must take place before a discovery moves into the second stage of preparing a marketable medication, one available to patients. And in supporting the IPD, donors are joining one of the newest, most exciting fields in medicine. Proteins mediate nearly every process in the human body, including disease progression. The ability to design new proteins with specific functions could transform disease diagnosis and vastly improve treatments. For diseases medi-cine cannot currently treat \u2014 such as celiac disease \u2014 designed proteins could offer patients significant hope. This debilitating digestive disorder, an intolerance to the gluten in some grains, afflicts 2.3 million people in the U.S. and accounts for $15-35 billion in health care costs annually. One IPD investigator, Ingrid Swanson Pultz, Ph.D., has devel-oped a set of proteins (variants on an enzyme named KumaMax) that have the capacity to digest gluten. The funding provided by the LSDF challenge was just what she needed to complete some basic research and conduct proof-of- concept studies. \"With additional gap funding, we expect to complete testing and other preparatory work in about a year,\" Pultz says. \"Then we will spin out Proteus PVP Biologics, the company forming around the KumaMax technology. If we secure venture funding, the most promising enzyme should be ready for initial clinical trials in 2017.\" Baker, the director of the Institute for Protein Design and a UW professor of biochemistry, is tremendously pleased at the success of the LSDF challenge \u2014 and what it may bring about. \"Scientists like Ingrid are developing protein designs that have the potential to change medicine in fundamental ways,\" says Baker. \"And our contributors are fundamental to their work.\" TAKING THE CHALLENGE Our thanks to the following contributors and to the Life Sciences Discovery Fund for their gener - osity to the Institute for Protein Design.

TAKING PROTEINS TO THE CLINIC Gifts put development on a fast track UW Medicine YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR MISSION 27 Gritman Medical Center in Moscow, Idaho, has adopted a creative approach to a growing problem: physician shortages. It can be hard to attract practitioners to rural communities because medical students graduating with heavy loan debt tend to seek higher-paying positions in metropolitan areas. In response, the Gritman Founda- tion and the medical center's auxiliary, dedicated to the health of people in their communities, created two endowed scholarships to support medical students from Idaho. This effort was matched by a gift from the Huckabay family, long-time, generous supporters of UW medical students. \"We want to reduce the burden of student loans facing future physi-cians, especially the ones who want to practice medicine in rural areas like Latah County,\" explains Kara Besst, CEO of Gritman Medical Center. \"With the Gritman scholarships and the Huckabay match, our community can take an active role in reducing the physician shortage in Idaho.\" Creating such scholarships is a solu- tion rooted in the strong relationships fostered by UW Medicine's WWAMI pro-gram. For more than 40 years, WWAMI has based medical educational programs and student rotations in Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. Students get to know the areas and the people in the communities \u2014 and they consider returning to their communities to practice. Michelle Spain, past president of the Gritman Medical Center Foundation board, and husband Francis Spain, M.D. '76, a family practitioner and graduate of the first Idaho WWAMI class, were leaders in the effort to create the scholarships. \"The new endowment is a forward- thinking way to attract physicians to the community by building relationships with medical students early on,\" says Michelle. She notes that \"everything fell into place\" after Francis developed ties with John Huckabay, a resident of Coeur d'Alene, who enthusiastically supported the scholarship program. Francis himself, of course, is an ex- ample of staying in the region to practice medicine, and he enjoys the close-knit relationships in his rural community. Francis also serves as a preceptor for medical students, and he was honored for his service with the 2012 Idaho WWAMI Alumni Award for Excellence in Mentoring, Teaching, Leadership and Patient Care. To Francis, all of these achieve- ments \u2014 his education, his career, his work to create the scholarship, his decades-long involvement in the WWAMI program \u2014 is an expression of the program's success. \"WWAMI has been phenomenal in training physicians from the region and encouraging them to practice in under - served areas,\" he says.

In a society marked by rapid change and evolving values, people who show this quality can be a rarity. But not at UW Medicine, where Turner Society members \u2014 individuals who give $1,000 or more annually \u2014 make major commitments to our work. In fiscal year 2014, more than 1,600 individuals and families belonged to the society, and they provided essential funds to scholarships, to research and \u2014 like Justin Fallstrom \u2014 to our hospitals and patient-related programs. Inspired by working on a remodeling project at Harborview Medical Center, Fallstrom made a gift to the center's mission of caring. \"I saw people coming in with severe problems and no place else to go,\" he says. (Read his story on page 22.)Fallstrom just became a member of the Turner Society in late 2013; in contrast, some Turner Society members have belonged to the society for some time: 70 individuals and families for 20 years or more; four for more than 30 years. Whether new donors or continuing donors, Turner Society members make the contri-butions \u2014 millions of dollars each year \u2014 that sustain our work. \"In 2014, more than 16,000 people and organizations gave to UW Medicine, a record-setting year,\" says Paul G. Ramsey, M.D., the CEO of UW Medicine. \"And many of those people are members of the Turner Society. I am very grateful for their partnership.\" The Turner Society Named after Edward L. Turner, M.D., the dedicated and visionary dean who founded the UW School of Medicine, the Turner Society is a group of contributors whose generous annual gifts to UW Medicine are essential to our work in research, education and patient care. UW Medicine YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR MISSION 29 < Alumni and Student Updates FALL 2014 29Photo courtesy of the WWAMI Idaho program Students from the WWAMI Idaho program, wearing their brand-new stethscopes. WELCOME TO YOUR CALLING: THE STETHOSCOPE CEREMONIES In touching ceremonies across the WWAMI region, the 240 students in this year's entering class received their first stethoscopes, a gift from the UW School of Medicine Alumni Association. Alumni volunteers from 20 classes ranging from 1954 to 2013 were on hand at each site to make the presentation. In Seattle, Estell Williams, M.D. '13, spoke about her journey to medical school, the strength of the alumni community and the important role physicians play in their communities. \"The stethoscope is a symbol to everyone of who you are and what you do. Being a physician is a privilege and should be a source of joy and profound satisfaction,\" said Williams. \"If you lose sight of that, it becomes merely a job. If you don't lose sight, it's a calling. Welcome to your calling.\" For one student, receiving a stethoscope was a family affair. Scott Kirkpatrick received his stethoscope from his father, Richard Kirkpatrick, M.D., '72; his uncle John Kirkpatrick, M.D. '73, also participated in the ceremony. \"Having my dad present me with a stethoscope is a moment I will remember forever,\" said Scott. The younger Kirkpatrick is enjoying school and is impressed by his classmates. \"Students are constantly going above and beyond to help others succeed. This has allowed me to learn more than I could have imagined in such a short time,\" says Kirkpatrick. He's also making sure to follow the advice \u2014 \"study hard, have fun, and go to Husky football games\" \u2014 given him by his dad and uncle.

Revered by their peers as innovators, leaders, re-searchers, teachers and compassionate physicians, four distinguished alumni received awards from the UW School of Medicine Alumni Association during Reunion Weekend, June 2014. 2014 Distinguished Alumni Award: George Ojemann, M.D., Res. '64 Ojemann, a UW emeritus faculty member, is a leader in the fields of neurological surgery and the neurosci-ences and was recognized for his career-long commitment to research and teaching. In the 1960s, Ojemann resur - rected an electric simulation mapping technique for cortical localization that had been developed in the 1940s but had fallen out of use. It's now the gold standard for planning cortical resections for epilepsy and brain tumors. Through his research, teaching and care, he has improved the lives of countless patients. Alumni Humanitarian Award: Matthew Oliva, M.D. '99, Res. '03 Oliva, who maintains a private practice in southern Oregon, was recog-nized for his commitment to eradicating blindness worldwide. As a lead col- laborator with the Himalayan Cataract Project, Oliva has completed thousands of sight-restoring cataract surgeries. He credits WWAMI for his interest in treating people in rural and underserved communities. Alumni Early Achievement Award: Erik Van Eaton, M.D. '01, Res. '08, Fel. '09 Van Eaton, a UW faculty member and a trauma surgeon at Harborview Medical Center and UW Medical Center, is also an entrepreneur and inventor. He is committed to improving patient care through efficiency, better communication and stronger resources for physicians. Van Eaton has devel-oped two software programs: UWCores, which helps improve the patient hand-off process in team care, and OCCAM (Online Clinical Care Algorithms and Messages), a system that can house all pharmaceutical information for a hospital or healthcare system. Alumni Service Award: Ted Epperly, M.D. '80 Epperly, president and chief execu- tive officer for the Family Medicine Residency of Idaho, was recognized for his leadership within the WWAMI pro-gram and for his advocacy for increasing access to high-quality care in Idaho. On the national stage, Epperly has been instrumental in the development of the Affordable Care Act and has met with President Obama and Congress numerous times. We also congratulate Ed Lopez, PA-C (Seattle Class 15), honored by MEDEX Northwest with their Lifetime Achievement Award. Lopez founded a physician assistant cardiac surgery business, helping numerous individuals in Washington launch careers in cardiology.

Photo: Todd Gardiner, Team Photogenic WHERE HIS PATH TAKES HIM Q & A With Resident Jack Sychev, M.D. When did you decide to pursue ophthalmology? Pretty early in medical school. It's hard to explain, but everyone folds into a certain niche where they feel comfortable. Also, you can see your diagnosis: you can take a look at the eye and often see what the problem is. The instruments we use are interesting, too. Very precise. Why are you focusing on the retina? The retina is probably the most interesting part of the eye. Once you have some appreciation for it, you start looking at it in a different light. Tell me about your year away from medical school. I wanted to take a year off medical school to do research; at the time, I was at Washington Univer - sity in St. Louis. When I emailed Dr. Van Gelder [the director of the UW Medicine Eye Institute], he told me about a few projects. I chose one that I thought was unique and very novel \u2014 I was helping test a chemical on the retina of blind mice. We hoped that they would react to light after being treated, and it worked! I think it's a very elegant solution, too. What is your residency like? I'm at the VA hospital, and I'm enjoying working with the veterans. It's my fourth year, so I'm doing more surgeries. It's exciting. Why are you enjoying working with the veterans? I'm working with a lot of vets from the Vietnam era, and they have a certain approach to life. They have a lot of resolve. You tell them about surgery, and they say, \"ok, well, let's just do it.\" What's next? I want to do retinal surgery. I'd also like to do a fellowship, and I have to find a research project and a mentor. I'd love to stay here, but you have to go where your path takes you. Read about Sychev's research on page 8.

We visited Reykjavik, Iceland's geothermal energy system, the wind turbines of the Shetland Islands and Copenhagen's bicycle-friendly commuter system in our quest to learn more about climate-change solutions. I hope to develop more expertise on how climate change will impact rural communities, and I have an opportunity to give a keynote talk on this topic in Dubrovnik, Croatia, for the WONCA Rural Health Conference in 2015.

The Art of Bicycle Biomechanics Erik Moen, P .T. '92 Mechanical harmony for bike and body: that's the goal for Erik Moen, P .T. '92, owner of Corpore Sano Physical Therapy and founder of BikePT. A physical therapist specializing in injury recovery and performance, Moen founded BikePT to help physical therapists and bicyclists make smart equipment choices, better understand musculoskeletal tolerances and learn the rules of bicycle positioning. \"There are more than 44 million bicyclists in the U.S. who ride their bikes at least six times per year. It's critical for the bike and the body to be working well together,\" says Moen. As a nationally known leader in bicycle biomechanics and bicycle fit- ting, Moen works with all bicyclists: those new to the sport, professionals, Paralympic athletes. \"Working with bicyclists, my job is to be the sleuth, to determine why an athlete has become injured and provide effective plans for care and return to sport,\" he says. One of his most rewarding experiences was helping a man whose hamstrings and common peroneal nerve had been lacerated in a bicycle crash while in the French Alps. \"After a long and arduous rehabilitation process, we got him back biking and running,\" says Moen. \"Just two years after this major accident, we entered a race together.\" Photo courtsey (Anchorage Class 1), pictured above, writes, \"I started working as a PA at Fisher Medical, a GP practice in Skipton, North Yorkshire, United Kingdom, in February 2014.

I applied and was accepted into MEDEX Northwest, and I graduated in 1970 along with 11 others. I am truly grateful for the training and guidance received from the MEDEX staff and for a wonderful preceptor, Wilfred (Willy) Gamon, M.D. I retired in 2011 after 40-plus years working as a physician assistant at Cheney Medical Center in Cheney, Wash., and with Kaiser Perma- nente of Vancouver, Wash.

I miss that practice and those hard-working, underserved patients very much.\"Living the Dream Alice Burden, PA-C (Seattle Class 41) What compels a research scientist to enter the world of healthcare? Experience and inspiration. \"I grew up on San Juan Island and witnessed the difficulties of a community that had more medical needs than resources,\" says Alice Burden, PA-C (Seattle Class 41). Burden, who studied fragile X syndrome, was also a former emergency medical techni-cian and a volunteer at Harborview Medical Center. She knew she liked healthcare. \"Becoming a PA seemed like the perfect way to return to my passion for providing quality care to underserved communities,\" she says. Today, Burden is a primary-care provider at Community Health Center of Snohomish County. \"Small victories, like helping a diabetic patient keep their blood glucose under control, or watching a patient with depression get back to work,\" says Burden, \"these things make my job rewarding.\" Burden's busy: taking care of patients, serving as a preceptor and putting in many grueling hours as an elite athlete. She finished her second IRONMAN triathlon in Whistler, B.C., this summer. \"I like to say I'm living the MEDEX dream,\" says Burden.
