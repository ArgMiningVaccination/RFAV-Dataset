Why Is Spiritual Wellness Important? Spiritual wellness in recovery can help people overcome some of the most harmful effects of a substance use disorder. It can help people to make new social groups, reduce levels of shame or guilt, and give them hope for the future. Spirituality isn't a requirement for recovery by any means - but the host of benefits can make it much easier for people to overcome their challenges and achieve long-lasting recovery. Spiritual Wellness in Recovery Spiritual wellness in recovery is by no means a new idea. In fact, it was a founding principle of the 12-Step support groups that have helped millions of people across the globe achieve recovery from substance use disorders. Spiritual Wellness an Alcoholics Anonymous The founder of [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://altacenters.com/addiction-resources/alcoholics-anonymous/), Bill Wilson, thought that a spiritual experience was the only thing that could surely help people to recover from crippling alcoholism - more than any medical or psychological treatment at the time. Wilson based many of his ideas of spiritual experience on the works of renowned psychologist William James, who wrote the book The Varieties of Religious Experience. The essential belief was that having a profound spiritual experience (not exclusive to any particular ideology) could fundamentally change a person for the rest of their life. This change was often enough to get people to stop drinking, seek out a moral path in life, and achieve continuous spiritual health. Relapse Prevention and Spiritual Wellness at Alta Centers Spiritual wellness can play an important role in relapse prevention. One of the core beliefs of relapse prevention programs is that the best deterrent to substance use is building a meaningful life worth living in recovery that directly opposes addiction, and spirituality is a valuable tool in building this recovery capital. Spiritual Wellness and Personal Growth People who strive for improving their spiritual wellness in recovery can build a life of meaning and purpose that is inherently valuable. If the time ever comes when they face a high-risk relapse situation, they are bolstered by the fact that returning to substance use would mean losing out on the incredible life they've built for themselves. By reaching spiritual well-being, they make the idea of relapse unpalatable and are better equipped to prevent relapse in the first place.
