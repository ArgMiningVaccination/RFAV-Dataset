A1denhof Courage THERE are two kinds of courage-that which everybody reads about and glories in, and that which, in the ordinary course of evcnts, goes unsung and unhonored .. It is just such courage as this latter that the governor of Louisiana displayeu Tues\u00b7 day. For it is a brave man indeed that will, in the face (If untold damagc and suf\u00b7 fering among his pe(lple, order the destruc\u00b7 tion of the t\\1in wall standing between many tllOusands of the remaining citizens and death and destruction. And doubly diffi. cult is the ,task of a man whose powcr and office depends upon those citizens. The aet of the governor will destroy mil\u00b7 lions of dollars worth of property which I must be paid for by an already heavily af\u00b7 i flieted state. Some lives may be lost. The 1 means of livelihood of many will be de\u00b7 1 stroyed. Homes will be broken up. These J are painful facts to face. Nevertheless, the J governor has had the courage, in the face of them, to order the blowing up of the levee so that the people of New Orleans and surrounding territory may have that much more ehance of escaping the flood. The nation cannot bdt respect and admire the quiet courage and adherence to duty of Governor Simpson. .' I~ \" rrWell, They Saved the Fair Lady, But-\" r , I HANNIBAL, Mo., and more particularly Hannibal's Dative son, John B. Powell, editor of the Chitla Weekly Review in Shanghai, is now embroiled in the Asiatic mess. And the embroiling process seems to point to the fact that when a man tries to shoot square, he is dallying with dangerous business. Mr, Powell, in his editorial capacity, strongly denounced the. sending of American troops t(l Shanghai for the defense of our nationals. Mr. Powell until recently has been a member of the American Chamber of Commerce at that port, but his writings 80 Itirred the ire of his fellow members that he WRS ousted at once. \"The American people,\" he wrote in an editorial under the caption of.\"WeU, They Saved the Fair Lady, But-,\" \"have DO business to interfere in the international af\u00ad fairs (If the Chinese. The chamber of com\u00ad merce apPArently believes in involving America in complications in this part of the world, which, in my opinion, may have a 1M rll.aching effect, even to the extent of an\u00b7 other world war.\" And further on, \"I be\u00ad lieve the Chinese have the right to express their views as well as the EngUsh or Amer\u00b7 , icans, or othcrs, and so long as I am engaged in the publicati(ln of any American paper in Shanghai it is my intention to give them a square deal.\" This, and his opposition to the barricad\u00ad ing of Shanghai i,n the face of China's civil war. has aroused the protests of all the so\u00b7 called \"whites\" in that part of the world. If it were not for the fact that Mr. Powell has repeatedly taken his stand with the Chinese mallllCS, and that he is well in\u00b7 formed on all that goes on in Asia, his editorials might e8lliJy be'discounted iUI the ravings of a sensation\u00b7seeker. But'tbis, because (If the tremendous popularity of his magazine among English\u00b7speaking China, ia ; Dot the case. T It seema sad that any man, 12,000 miles 1 from hill home, should be ostracized trom his own people merely because he inailtl tlLat ! \"yellow\" people are human beings and have mindll of their own. But, more important. ly. hill c!!8C prove8 that the \"l!i~ 1Il!D'~ I narrow\u00b7mindedness and prejudlee is not con\u00b7 fined to the home environment. It is a dis\u00b7 ease that he carries with him in his peregri\u00ad nations (lver the globe. Our Little Laws WE little realize how watchful some of our minor laws are on (lur behalf. A printer or engraver, for instance, may not reproduce the photograph of an envelope without first defacing the stomp. The coupon in a magazine advertisement may not be more than a specified size in proportion to the whole advertisement, or the magazine becomes a catalogue and losel'! its mailing privileges. Money may not be reproduccd, nor may the flag of thc Unitcd States be lIscd for ad\u00b7 vertising purposes. A druggist may not selcct a cigar from tbe box and pass it to you, but must offer y(lU the entire OOX ond let yon make your own selection. When the box is empty he mllst destroy the revenne stamp. ITo is not allowed to take the last few cigars fl'(lm n nearly empty box to fill out the top row of another box. The cigars must stay in the original box until aU are sold. Our laws make it practically impossible for anyone to get oleomargurine when hc thinks he is getting hutter. Short.weight scoles are confiscated lmder federal law. Eggs are carefully graded aecording to original quality and current degree of freshness. There seems to be a law against \"almost everything,\" in fact, except the crime of taking the first half of a moving picture to tell who held the camera and who selected the costumes. Here, it seems, is one lone ploce where \"there ought to be a law.\" Musical Trains THERE'LL be music in the ail' along tIle right\u00b7of-way of the Burlington railroad in the vicinity or Chicago. This road is in\u00b7 stalling a new musical whistle on the loco\u00ad motives of its suburban service between Chi\u00b7 cago and Aurora. For years the road has been reeciving complainf;.,> of the locomotive's whistle, and finally in desperation Pres. TIale TIolden ordered that something be done. Between Hawthorne. where the track elevation starts and stops anel Aurora, there are more than forty-six grade crossings and there was Il population. in 1920, of 122,265, which the railroad believes has doubled sincc. The grade crossing alarm is the most ear split. ting blast that the engineers could devise after fiftcen years of tests. It is little wonder that the people were driven nearly frantic, and appealed to the officials of the road. 'rhe new whistle which is. being substituted has some of the charactcristics of the musi\u00b7 cal auto horns. Insteild of sounding each tone separately as do tho horns on the smart roadsters, however, this new device blends all of the tones intQ one soultcl. Now, if they could only find some way of replacing the bells on the engines with sets of Westminster chimes, living along It rail. road track wouldn't be half bad. He Who Howls THERE is just one way to positively avoid paying a fine for breaking traffic regu\u00b7 lations; that is not to break them. 'rhe man who objects to a fine the most is usnally the most persistent lawbreaker. lIe is the alibi man who always \"knows that it was not his fault.\" Enforcing the traffic laws is no small job, and it keeps the police force busy dnrin{t thc entire season. Yet there arc. evidences of violation cyery day. Motorists who know better will deliberately drive by an arterial sign or will exceed the city speed limit. Of course there is no excuse for it, but they come before the police judge thinking that they should not have becn arrested. The man who cries for justice in the po\u00b7 lice court-and means something clse-is the one who w(luldn't give the other fellow a square deal on the road. H he doesn't want to be arrested and hailed into court, he should not break the law. Editorial Notes 1\\11'8.
