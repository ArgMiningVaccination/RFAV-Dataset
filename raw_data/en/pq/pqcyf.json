AN EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIP The University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey 's Hispanic Center of Excellence and Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities have collaborated on this publication as we are deeply committed to promoting culturally competent health care, advocacy, collabora tive research and community outreach programs for the elimination of health disparities throughout N ew Jersey. This publication highlights the Universities' diverse research and outreach efforts which have the goal of ultimately leading to a health care system and workforce that is capable of delivering the highest- quality care to every patient regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, or language proficiency. Hispanic Center of Excellence The Hispanic Center of Excellence (HCOE) is situated in the New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) in Newark. Its mission is to improve the health status of Latinos represen ted in the health professions who will in turn practice medicine in the nation's underserved areas and conduct research on health issues afflicting Latinos. Some of the Center's goals are to: \u0083 Offer educational programs which will inform faculty, staff and students about health issues affecting the Hispanic and other underserved populations; \u0083 Increase library holdings on issues that impact the health of H ispanics; \u0083 Increase student and faculty involvement in research on issues affecting the Hispanic Community; \u0083 Implement culturally competent curricula. Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities The Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (IEHD) is a University wide, integrated center of leadership and excellence, dedicated to the elimination of heal th disparities in New Jersey and the nation. The IEHD develops and supports collaborative networks and initiativ es to promote research, effective interventions, education, and advocacy for the benefit of elimi nating health disparities across all populations in New Jersey, but especially those who are most at risk for dispr oportionate morbidity and mortality. In embracing UMDNJ's strategic mission, the Institute's agenda builds upon the conduct of research and the acquisition of scientific evidence required to guide the interv entions needs to eliminate health disparities across a spectrum of conditions and diseases. A major thrust is the p romotion and promulgation of health disparities research being conducted by UMDNJ faculty and staff. The Instit ute provides funding for faculty pilot projects, provides training and fieldwork opportunities for stu dents, collects data and information on health disparities, links faculty with internal resources and external partners and resources, and maintains a database of faculty research on health disparities. Support for this publication was provided by the Hispanic Cente r of Excellence and the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities. The Health Resources and Services Administration p rovided primary support for the preparation of the publication through Grant 5D34HP02045 from the Division of Heal th Careers Diversity and Development, Bureau of Health Professions for the Hispanic Center of Excellence. The Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities provide d additional support through its grant from the Office of Minority Health, US Department of Health and Human Services. T his grant provided funding for the forum \"UMDNJ Health Disparities Research Symposium\" held June 17, 2005 from which a number of abstracts in this publication were compiled.

Health Disparities are the differences in the incidence, preval ence, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific p opulation groups in the United States. Racial and ethnic minorities tend to receive lower-quality health care than whites do, even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions are comparable. Reasons for health disparities include but are not limited to differences in risk factors, lack of access to healt h care, inadequately targeted prevention messages, and cultural differences between the healthcare system and the population it serves.1 In New Jersey, as in the country as a whole, disparities in hea lth status exist between whites and other racial and ethnic groups. For example, recent studies show that 32.2% of Latinos, 20.7% of African-Americans and 14.5% of Asian American/Pacific Islanders in New Jersey lac k health insurance whereas only 11.3% of Whites lack the same coverage.2 Also, African Americans in New Jersey have higher mortality ra tes from cardiovascular disease than do whites, both for heart disease ( 287.6 versus 249.6 per 100,000) and for stroke (65.6 versus 41.9 per 100,000).3 The disparities illustrated by these two examples can be found across numerous diseases and conditions including Cancer, HIV/AIDS, Di abetes and Infant Mortality. Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health will requir e enhanced efforts at preventing disease, promoting health and delivering appropriate care. This will nec essitate improved collection and use of standardized data to correctly identify all high risk populatio ns and monitor the effectiveness of health interventions targeting these groups. It will also require new knowledge about the determinants of disease, causes of health disparities, and effective interventions for p revention and treatment. It will require improving access to the benefits of society, including quality preventive and treatment services, as well as innovative ways of working in partnership with health care systems, State and local governments, tribal governments, academia, national and community-based organizations, and commu nities.4 Cultural competence has gained attention as a potential strateg y to improve quality and eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in health care. Cultural competence is defined as \"The ability of systems to provide care to patients with diverse values, beliefs and behaviors inc luding tailoring delivery of care to meet patients' social, cultural, and linguistic needs. The ultimate goal is a health care system and workforce that can deliver the highest quality of care to every patient, regardless of rac e, ethnicity, cultural background, or English proficiency.\"5.Fundamentally , cultural competence is the assimilation and transformation of knowledge about individuals and groups of people into specific standards, polic ies, practices, and attitudes used in suitable cultural settings to augment the quality of services; thereby p roducing better healthcare outcomes. Cultural competence has emerged as an important issue for vario us practical reasons. First, as the United States becomes more diverse, clinicians will increasingly see patients with a broad range of perspectives regarding health, often influenced by their social or cultural backgrounds. For instance, patients may present their symptoms quite differently from the way they are presented in medical textbooks. They may have limited English proficiency, different thresholds for seeking care or expectati ons about their care, and unfamiliar beliefs that influence whether or not they adhere to providers' recommendations. Second, research has shown that provider-patient communication is linked to patient satisfaction, adherence to medical instructions, and health outcomes. Thus, poorer health outcomes may result when sociocultural differences between patients and providers are not reconciled in the clinical encounter. Ultimately, these barriers do not apply only to minority groups but may simply be more pronounced in thesecases. Finally, two landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports\u2014 Crossing the Quality Chasm and Unequal Treatment \u2014highlight the importance of patient-centered care and cultural competence in improving quality and eliminating racial/ethnic health care disparities.6 Presently, cultural competence training is a critical area of i nterest to regulatory bodies and policy makers in charge of overseeing the operations of healthcare ins titutions. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which accredits programs of medical education leadin g to MD degrees, and the Accreditation Counsel for Graduate Medical Education, which evaluates and acc redits medical residency programs in the United States, have established guidelines and standards requir ing medical students, residents and faculty to receive cultural competence training. The United States Department of Health and Human Services - Off ice of Minority Health has established National Standards for Culturally and Linguisticall y Appropriate Services (CLAS) in Health Care. This model, which contains fourteen standards for recognizing p rocesses in the skills and development of linguistic and cultural competency, demands that we embrace and continue to challenge our creativity and adherence to ethical principles through formal instructional ef forts. State legislatures are also beginning to recognize the importan ce of patient-centered care and cultural competence in improving quality care and eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities. On March 23, 2005 New Jersey became the first state to require all physicians to complete \"Cultural Competency Training\" as a condition of licensure or re-licensure. As a result of this leg islation, physicians will be provided with educational programs to help them keep abreast of the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to care for New Jersey's diverse population. Under the new strategic plan being developed at UMDNJ, cultural and linguistic competency is a major objective in meeting our mission. The University has embr aced strategic initiatives geared towards enhancing its role in establishing a culturally and linguistica lly competent healthcare organization. UMDNJ's Hispanic Center of Excellence and Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities serve as advocates, partners and a resource for the accomplishment of this goal.

Co-Authors: Jennifer Winters MRN, Sarajane Rath CHES, Lisa Bernstein1 School: New Jersey Medical School Introduction : Functional health literacy is defined as \"the patient's abili ty to read, comprehend, and act on medical instructions\". The DHHS Healthy People 2010 plan concludes that addressing health literacy is not only an issue of promoting improved individual health outcomes for residents in poorer neighborhoods, but an essential step in addressing the overall question of health disparities. http://www.healthypeople.gov/document/html/objectives Methods: Beginning in December 2004, The Test of Functional Health Lite racy in Adults (TOFHLA) was administered to all pregnant patients at the prenatal care orie ntation meeting. Patients are classified into three groups: functionally illiterate, marginally literate, and fully literate. Functionally illiterate patients are given appointments with Jennifer Winters and marginally literate pati ents are given appointments with Theodore Barrett, at which time the mother-to-be is invited to participate in the literacy intervention. Clients are paired off with Newark Literacy Campaign tutors for literacy education, which i s conducted in conjunction with our Health Educator (Sarajane Rath). The core curriculum is designed by Th e What to Expect Foundation* and the goals are de-mystification of the healthcare system, keeping appointments , roles of the health care team members and prenatal education. Outcome measures include the time between f irst contact and first physician/provider visit, gestational age on entry to prenatal care, number of appointmen ts missed, number of emergency visits to the Hospital, number returning for the postpartum visit, and the nu mber of women who abandon care. Results: To date we have screened 678 English speakers and 284 Spanish speakers, with 94% and 98%, respectively, completing and returning the TOFHLA. Among Englis h speakers, 14% are functionally illiterate and 9% are marginally illiterate, while among Spanish speakers, 40% are functionally illiterate and 15% are marginally illiterate. Because the research design calls for two provider s to see all intervention patients, we can only enroll a portion of all eligible women in the literacy intervention, and hence women who are not enrolled, but who have similar literacy skills comprise the normal care comparison gro ups. To date, 108 functionally illiterate and 29 marginally illiterate women have been enrolled in the literacy intervention. Their respective comparison groups are comprised of 78 functionally illiterate women and 65 marginally literate women receiving usual care. Results through March, 2005, indicate a marked reduction in the time to first prenatal visit and gestational age at entry to care (3 days, 16.9 weeks vs. 39 days, 19.8 weeks and 7 days, 16 .9 weeks vs. 38 days, 18.7 weeks for the functionally illiterate and marginally literate groups respecti vely). There is greater educational contact hours/patient and fewer women abandoning care in the intervention group. Ther e are no differences in the number of patients who missed appointments or who had emergency visits between usu al care and intervention groups . Conclusion: While still early in the project, participation in literacy tr aining gets women into care sooner and at earlier gestational ages. Moreover fewer women abandon care in the intervention group.

Bennett, MPH, RD. School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Community Medicine I, a required course for first year students , uses an evidence based medicine approach, including independent reading and small group discussion, to in troduce students to various public health \"hot topics,\" including health disparities. This course also gives s tudents their first experience in direct patient care through a preceptorships program in family medicine clinical of fices in the community. To compel students to combine their newly acquired skill in use of evidence based med icine and apply it to patient care, a stand-alone e- learning (WebCT) module was created on Tobacco Use & Dependence . The module focuses primarily on introducing students to the US Public Health Service's clinical practice guidelines on caring for the tobacco addicted patients. Links to evidence based and anecdotal readin gs on tobacco are provided, including readings on health disparity issues regarding tobacco use, nicotine metabol ism and cigarette marketing. Following study through the module, students engage in a standardized patient e ncounter in which they are challenged with counseling a minority teen regarding her tobacco use. This post er showcases design of module and standardized patient case components. Quantitative Light-Induced Fluorescence (QLF) Assessment of Acid Induced Enamel Lesions Primary Author: M. Bennet Co-Authors: K. Markowitz, D. Fine School: New Jersey Dental School Objectives: The anatomic features of pit and fissures caries make early di agnosis difficult. Quantitative light- Inspektor Research BV) offers a meth od of assessing early lesions. We used QLF to examine the progression of enamel lesions induced by repeated t reatments with 2 acids that cause different patterns of enamel damage. Methods: Two acid treatments were used to create lesions on smooth surf aces (SS) and occlusal surfaces (OS) of sterile extracted teeth (5 teeth in each group): 1) Ultradent\u00ae 35% phosphoric acid (H 2PO4) gel, pH 1. 2) 36.5% HCl, pH 0. QLF readings were made before and after 1, 2, 4, 6 a nd 8 hours of demineralization on dry OS and one 2-hour treatment on dry SS and Fluorescent change (\u00ffF %) calcul ated. Enamel \u00ffF% reflects mineral density changes. Statistical significance of \u00ffF was established by ANOV A and post-hoc testing (P< 0.05). Results: OS treated for 6 hours with H 2PO4 demonstrated an average -\u00ffF of 25.5% (mineral loss). Smaller - \u00ffF values were recorded at lower time intervals. 8 hours -\u00ffF was 1 7.4%. 6 and 8 hours changes in \u00ffF were statistically significant (P< 0.05 compared to baseline). Photography reveale d a white frosted appearance. QLF analysis of HCl treated OS failed to demonstrate significant \u00ffF (maximum -\u00ffF= 8 .5%) even though photography reveled loss of enamel. Similar QLF and photographic observations were made fol lowing acids treatment of SS. A statistically significant -\u00ffF (P< 0.05) of 17.8 % was seen after H 2PO4 only. In contrast, QLF measures small (non-significant) +\u00ffF after SS were treated with HCl even though erosions were ob served photographically. Conclusion: Early caries often appears as a small white area. The QLF read s the white opaque surfaces of phosphoric acid tooth surfaces as demineralized but failed to c orrectly assess HCl eroded enamel as being demineralized based on \u00ffF determination.- 3 -Winter and Summer Blood Lead and Serum 25 Hydroxy-Vitamin D Concentrations in Newark, NJ, Children Primary Author : John Bogden, PhD Co-Authors : Francis W Kemp, BS, Prasad Neti, PhD, Roger W Howell, PhD, Peter Wenger, MD, Donald B Louria , MD School : New Jersey Medical School Introduction : Although the seasonal variability of blood lead is widely rec ognized, specific climate and other factors that may cause this phenomenon have not been rigorously studied. Sunlight-induced vitamin D synthesis is greater in the summer, is influenced by skin pigmentation, and may modify gastrointestinal lead absorption or release into blood of lead stored in bones. Methods : We studied the effect of season on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25-OH-D) and blood lead in 78 1-3 year-old and 63 4-8 year-old Newark children. Of the 141 childr en 90 were African-American and 51 were Hispanic. Results : Blood lead concentrations were 4.94-\u00b13.94 mcg/dL and 6.54\u00b17.2 7 mcg/dL during the winter and summer months for ages 1-3, a winter/summer (W/S) increase of 32.4%. T here was a smaller W/S increase of 13.3% in blood lead from 3.68\u00b12.51 to 4.17\u00b12.90 mcg/dL for ages 4-8. Non e of the 51 Hispanic children had an elevated blood lead concentration (\u00ff 10 mcg/dL) during the winter, and o nly 1 had an elevated summertime concentration. In contrast elevated blood lead concentrations were frequent in African-American children, especially those ages 1- 3. For the latter, the percentage with elevated blood lead lev els increased from 12.2% in winter to 22.5% in summer. Ages 1-3 had serum 25-OH-D concentrations during the winter and 39.8\u00b114.7 mcg/L and 40.4\u00b113.1 mcg/L, a 1.5% W/S 4-8 increase in 25-OH-D was from 29.7\u00b112.6 to 39.3\u00b111.3 mcg/L, an increase of 32.3%. The percentages of chil dren with low (<16 mcg/L) serum 25-OH-D concentrations were 8.5% in winter and 0.7% in summer. The perc entage of children with low serum 25-OH-D concentrations was consistently greater in African-American tha n Hispanic children. The large seasonal increase in blood lead in ages 1-3 was not accompanied by a significant inc rease in serum 25-OH-D concentrations. In contrast the seasonal increase in blood lead in ages 4-8 was accompanied by a large increase in serum 25-OH-D levels, and the increases were significantly associated (r=0.373, p=0.0026) . Conclusion : The higher summertime 25-OH-D concentrations for the 4-8 year old children are likely due to increased sunlight-induced vitamin D synthesis and may contribu te modestly to the seasonal increase in blood lead. Age and race appear to be key factors that affect blood lead an d Vitamin D nutrition, as well as their interactions, in young urban children.Supported by the Institute for Elimination of Health Disparitie s and the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey.- 4 -Reliability and Validity of the Child Oral Health Impact Profil e (COHIP) Primary Author: Hilary L. Broder, PhD, MEd School: New Jersey Dental School Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the reliabili ty and validity of the Child Oral Health Impact Profile (COHIP). The questionnaire consists of 34 items that assess oral symptoms, functional well-being, emotional well-being, social well-being, health/self-esteem and health expectancies. In an effort to develop a culturally-sensitive instrument to reduce health disparities an d evaluate oral health needs among children and adolescents, the COHIP was designed to measure oral health-rela ted QOL of children as reported by children or by their caregivers. The items assess positive as well as negative impacts. Methods: Children and their caregivers were recruited from pediatric, o rthodontic, and craniofacial clinical settings in the US and Canada. A comparison group of children not seekin g dental treatment was recruited from elementary and middle schools in NJ. Reliability was assessed with Cronbac h's alpha coefficient, and subscale independence with Spearman's correlation. Groups were compared by ANOVA to t est discriminant validity. Results: The children (N=525) averaged 11.6 years (s.d.=1.60); 51.6 % w ere scores ranged from 28 to 135 (mean SD, 99.0 19.2) for the children and 38 to 101.5 (mean SD, 101.6 19.0) for the caregivers. Reliability for the total COHIP was favorable: Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.92 for both the children and caregivers. Spearman correlations between the subscales were m odest, ranging from .20-.48 for children and from .25-.55 for caregivers, indicating that they were measuring dif ferent constructs. Discriminant validity was indicated by reliable differences between diagnostic groups for both chil dren (p < .0075) and caregivers (p < .0001). Payor status (Medicaid vs. non-Medicaid) and ethnicity were associate d with COHIP summary scores. Conclusion: The COHIP is a reliable and valid measure for assessing oral h ealth-related quality of life in children by both self-report and informant report. Further testing will examine the utility of the instrument in both clinical and epidemiological samples. NIDCR supported: R01 DE13732- 5 -Disparities in of Stillbirth Primary Author: Michael Brimacombe, PhD. Co-Author: Debra Heller, MD. School: New Jersey Medical School Introduction: Fetal demise is an ongoing tragedy for which there is often no explanation, even with detailed clinical examination and autopsy. It may strike the same famil y several times, suggesting that genetic and/or environmental factors are contributory. That environment plays a major role is supported by higher incidence rates among women in lower-socio-economic groups, who likely are subj ect to greater levels of stress and/or to greater exposure to environmental toxins. In this study we sought to co mpare the incidence and causes of stillbirth in two communities within the same geographic region in New Jersey, on e characterized by affluence (Hackensack Medical Center, Bergen County) and one by poverty (University H ospital, Essex County). Methods: A stillbirth is defined as an intrauterine fetal death at >20 weeks of gestational age or intrapartum death of a third trimester infant. The data presented here are the re sults obtained from 4 years of the stillbirth autopsy service (operated by Dr. D. Heller) which is available to all O bstetrics - Gynecology clinicians at University Hospital in Newark, as well as on a consultation basis to clini cians in the New Jersey area. Approximately 30 cases have been investigated each year. This study focuses on 52 stil lbirths from University Hospital and 55 from Hackensack Medical Center. In order to better interpret the cli nical results for our sample, background stillbirth- related data was obtained for Essex and Bergen Counties from th e NJ Center for Health Statistics, a component of the NJDHSS. This background data, shown here for the years 1998 - 2000, compares overall rates of common prenatal risk factors such as low birth weights, lower gestatio nal age and delayed access to prenatal care between Essex and Bergen County. Results: In these validated cases that underwent autopsy we were able t o identify a cause of death in 70%, better than the national average of 50% of cases having no explanation at autopsy. The most pronounced difference between groups is that infection, potentially preventable, was detected in nearly 35% of stillbirths from University Hospital vs. 14% from Hackensack Medical Center. Mothers of sti llbirths in Essex versus Bergen County are characterized by younger age, higher levels of parity, gravidit y, smoking, single marital status and very low birth weight infants. There is no difference in the incidence of stil lbirth due to unknown cause between the two sites. Conclusion: This case series forms an observational study serving as a typ e of natural experiment with rare pediatric autopsy data being collected in a comparable setting for stillbirths drawn from socio-economically distinct populations. The differences observed can be interpreted as be ing related primarily to prenatal care, existing maternal health and a higher rate of infection in lower socio-e conomic settings where prenatal care is less pervasive. Good background demographic data allows for useful interpretation of these case series. Surprisingly, the numbers of cases with unknown causation are equally high in both case series and underscore the need for more detailed study. The high incidence of infection in Newark still births suggests potential for interventional strategies designed to detect and treat occult infections in pregnant wome n in order to reduce the incidence of stillbirth.- 6 -Clinical Trials and Cancer Treatment Decision-Making: A Pilot S tudy to Examine Awareness, Access and Utilization by Diverse New Jersey Populations Primary Author: Diane R. Brown, PhD School: School of Public Health This is a proposal to assess the extent to which participation in clinical trials is a part of the treatment decision- making process for persons diagnosed with cancer in New Jersey. The project is a follow-up to the many efforts undertaken in New Jersey to publicize and recruit persons into clinical trials. The proposed project will also assess differences by race/ethnicity, gender, and cancer site in knowl edge of clinical trials, access to clinical trials, as well as actual participation. The research uses a telephone survey o f cancer survivors diagnosed during 2001 prior to major New Jersey clinical trials initiatives such as Project Im pact and Clinical Trials Connect. These findings will be contrasted with data from a telephone survey of cancer survi vors diagnosed during the latter part of 2003 and early 2004, after the initiation of these major New Jersey clin ical trials initiatives. The proposed project will be implemented by the UMDNJ's Institute for The Elimination of Hea lth Disparities in collaboration with the Office of the NJ State Cancer Registry and be implemented over a two y ear period. The specific aims are to: 1) examine the extent to persons diagnosed with cancer in New Jersey are k nowledgeable of clinical trials and how to access them and to determine if there are disparities in these outcome s by race/ethnicity, gender and cancer site; 2) examine the extent to which clinical trials are a part of treat ment decision-making among persons diagnosed with cancer in New Jersey and to determine if there are disparities in these outcomes by race/ethnicity, gender and cancer site; 3) examine the extent to which persons diagnosed w ith cancer in New Jersey have participated in cancer clinical trials and their assessment of participation an d to determine if there are disparities in these outcomes by race/ethnicity, gender and cancer site; and 4) assess the ex tent which the gap in clinical trial participation rates between African Americans and Caucasians have changed (decrease d) after the implementation of the specific New Jersey clinical trials initiatives. Findings from the study are expected to provide a basis for future interventions.

Brown, PhD School: School of Public Health Introduction: Social support has been shown to have value in decreasing morb idity and possibly in increasing length of survival in cancer patients (Spiegel, 1990; Fawzy, Co usins, Fawzy, et al., 1990). Yet, few studies using psychosocial interventions have included African Americans, eve n though breast cancer mortality is higher for African American women than their Caucasian counterparts. Some studies have noted the significance of religion and spirituality in the lives of African Americans, while other studies have suggested a link between spiritual well- being and the ability to cope with chronic illnesses, such as c ancer. However, few studies have examined the impact of a spiritual -based social support intervention on enhancing treatment-related outcomes for African American women with breast cancer. The proposed work has four objective s: 1) to utilize a network of oncology services, churches, and community organizations to recruit African Americ an women diagnosed with breast cancer for project participation; 2) to implement the spiritual-based inte rvention; 3) to assess the efficacy of the intervention to positively impact treatment-related outcomes; and 4) to refine the intervention for broader dissemination. Based upon a social support paradigm, four hypotheses are posed: (H1) Women in the spiritual-based intervention will have less depression, anger and anxiety than women who are in t he control groups. (H2) Women in the spiritual- based intervention will have greater overall quality of life th an women who are in the control groups. (H3) Women in the spiritual-based intervention will have greater use of he alth promoting behaviors than those who are in the control groups. (H4) Women in the spiritual-based intervention will have greater treatment compliance than those who are in the control groups. Methods: The intervention involves an experimental/control group design approach. The experimental support group (intervention group) will receive the Spiritual-based sup port intervention. There will be two control groups: control group A will include participants in a traditional supp ort group model and control group B will include individuals who receive the standard care consisting of no addi tional structured support. An Advisory Committee comprised of breast cancer survivors and local clergy will prov ide guidance to project implementation. The basic content for the support groups covers well-established topics r anging from grief, family and intimate relationships to self esteem, stress management and goal-setting. However, t he spiritual support group encompasses exercises and practices such as prayer, and personal expressions of spiri tuality. Over a three year period the intervention will be tested in three separate rounds. Each round consists of sev en sessions, with one session held each month. It is projected that 45 women will participate in each round, 15 wome n in each group. Participants will be African American breast cancer patients within 24 months of diagnosis, 40 to 65 years of age, diagnosed at stage I, II, or III, have no history of recurrent disease and present with a maximum of one co-morbid condition. Data will be gathered through a pre-test at baseline (T1), a post test at the conclus ion of the 7 month intervention (T2), and at a three- month follow-up at the end of the support group sessions (T3). The outcome measures have been validated on minority and/or illness populations. Participants will receive a $70 incentive at the end of each round. Given the higher mortality rate among African American breast cancer pati ents, it is hoped that the intervention will be successful in demonstrating an improved quality of life and men tal health for African American women with breast cancer; that they will exhibit more health promoting behaviors and that they will be more adherent to their treatment regimens.Results : Preliminary results suggest the importance of spirituality as an activity that can be legitimately used to complement medical care.

Pogue, MPH School: School of Public Health Introduction : The purpose of the study is to obtain a better understanding of diabetics' perceptions of self- management, and whether or not they currently engage in self-ca re practices. Such data are needed to serve as a foundation for the development of a community-based interventio n to improve self-management within the diabetic community of Essex County, with the possibility of expansion to other parts of NJ. Methods : Three focus groups of 8-10 persons were held with diabetic pa tients identified in the federally qualified health centers. The focus group script was designed to collect data on patient's knowledge of diabetes, their use of health care and their adherence to diabetes treatment protocols . Barriers to adherence were also ascertained. The focus group script was translated into Creole and Spanish. Results: Results showed that a major need among diabetics is that of inf ormation. This was more of an implication, and not directly stated, but patients need to understand that c omplications are not inevitable, and usually result from non-compliance; they don't have to happen. Specific to Haitian participants, they need to be informed about the effectiveness of modern medicine, without being culturally inse nsitive. They can supplement their medical regimens with home remedies, but they should not act as a subst itute. Another theme revolving around information deals with perceived severity. Some of the participants will on ly go for regular medical check-ups, when they perceive that there is a problem. The focus should be on the im portance of regular monitoring of the disease, or primary prevention of complications. It comes up again, specifi cally with Haitian patients, but reliance on home remedies is common because they don't require money and are cus tomary in their homeland, where access to basic healthcare resources is limited. The results also show that the re is a language barrier among some of the Haitian patients. Some felt that language inhibited their ability to ad here with medical regimens. Other participants were more fluent in the English language, or had family members who were able to translate. Culture was not as blatantly obvious with the African American population. For this group, adherence issues were related to lifestyle. Some participants expressed extreme frus tration around having to give up foods that they were accustomed to (i.e. high fat, high salt food) so they would rat her eat what they want, versus submit to a disease in which they didn't have enough information about what the end re sult would be. The following are pivotal to the improvement of, and/or adoption of self-care techniques among t he study population: Education about disease prevention; Information on accessing necessary resources & acce ss to the resources; Instructions in multiple languages; Information on living with diabetes and how to alter entire lifestyle. Conclusion : While it is important that the diabetic population work coll aboratively with the physicians to improve their health, there exist barriers to doing so. Haitian patien ts were dealing with language barriers as well as lacking access to health insurance and appropriate glucose monitoring d evices. African Americans wanted more information on how to find a happy medium between managing thei r health and maintaining some semblance of their current lifestyle. They also wanted to know what progress ive measures are being taken to find a cure for this chronic illness. Overall, it appears that the key to improved self-management practices revolves around diabetics having access to the resources that they feel are necessary, as well as more information on how to deal with this chronic condition.- 9 -Resources and Strategies for Community-Based Cancer Prevention And Control in a Diverse Urban Population Primary Author: Diane R. Brown, PhD School: School of Public Health Introduction : Statistics from the New Jersey State Cancer Registry clearly show disparities in cancer incidence and mortality by gender, race, age and geographic location. Despite encouraging strides made in the assessment and treatment of many cancers, New Jersey residents in a number of population subgroups do not seem to be benefiting from these advances. These disparities suggest an inconsistency in access and use of screening, education and treatment services. Methods: In an effort to address these disparities and develop services that are culturally competent and responsive to the needs of diverse populations, the proposed project will identify existing cancer resources in the greater Newark area and use focus groups to gain community perspectives on the screening, educational and unmet treatment needs. The focus groups will be conducted with diver se ethnic populations including Latinos, Blacks of various ethnic backgrounds, and Caucasian residents of Newark. This proposed project will assess the current availability, awareness and perceptions of screening, education and treatment services for each of the following cancer sites: breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer. Results: After assessing the gaps in service, a community-based cancer summit will be convened for the purposes of sharing findings with the broader community, devising approp riate community-based strategies and establishing an implementation plan to meet service needs. Funded by Cancer Institute of New Jersey Community Health Mapping Primary Author: Irina McKeehan Campbell, PhD, MPH School: School of Nursing Community health policy for reducing health disparities is ofte n based on data derived from government sponsored health surveys which do not systematically monitor community ri sk factors of chronic diseases, together with personal health practices. Community health interventions are o ften reduced to modifying those individual behaviors which appear to be most controlled by individual choi ce. Much of public health surveillance is structured by data collection protocols which do not easily permit linking proximal risks for chronic diseases with distal risks from environmental or socioeconomic data. A current trend in th e growth of evidence-based health policy is the recognition that research cannot be translated into practice wi thout multidisciplinary collaboration with such fields as Health Informatics. The application of information technolog y, like Geographic Information Systems (GIS), permits linking public health data with a variety of databases through geocoding techniques. The expansion of computerization in statistical methods permits analyzing a vari ety of causal relationships derived from geocoded data, through linear and nonlinear mixed models. Such technolog ical advances enable the empirical testing of theoretical paradigms not possible without this technology, as well as the creation of health information from existing unmined resources. Availability of health information is vital for policy interventions that propose to improve health outcomes a.) by increasing community participati on in designing interventions, b.) by increasing access to and delivery of high quality health care, and c.) by defining consumer self-care as the single most significant factor in the prevention of chronic diseases and pr emature mortality. The availability of health information is also vital for the evaluation of cost-benefit an d effectiveness of interventions.- 10 -Oral Cancer Age - Adjusted Incidence and Mortality Rates Among Adults in New Jersey from 1996-2002 Primary Author: Rufus Caine, Jr., DDS, MPH Co-Authors: Samuel Quek, DMD, MPH, Elise Kumar, Msc, Richard Montgomery, DD S, MPH. School: School of Public Health Objective: The aims of the study were to describe the age-adjusted incide nce and mortality trends for oral cancer from 1996-2002 for the New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR) ; and to compare the age-adjusted incidence and mortality trends for state (NJSCR) and national (SEER) oral can cer trends. Materials and Methods: The sample size was 3164 cases of primary and in situ neoplas m of the oral cavity that was reported to the New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR). I t was a population-based incidence registry with a population of 8.4 million people. The sampling design was a non probability based convenience approach. The sampling elements were adult males and females with oral cancer from 1996-2002. The secondary source of data reflected age-adjusted incidence rates from 1998-2002 and the a ge-adjusted mortality rates from 1998-2001. The study design was cross-sectional. The dependent variables were the age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates for oral cancer. Univariate analyses were performed. Results: Current trends revealed a general decline for white males and females in their age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates. Black males had the highest age-adjusted incid ence rates (23.1-27.8, X = 21.72, S.D. mortality rates (8.5-10.5 X = 9.1667, S.D. = 1.11295).Black females age-adjusted incidence rates were (7.9-4.2, X = 6.5, S.D. = 1.50665). White females had incidence rate (6.9 -5.6, X = 6.157, S.D. = 0.56231) and mortality rates (1.8-1.3, X = 1.5167, S.D. = 0.19408). Black females had higher age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates than white females. All Males groups had higher age-adjusted inciden ce rates = 4.2667, S.D. = 0.45461) than all female incidence rates (6.9-5.9, X = 6.286, S.D. = 0.52099) and mortality rates (2.0-1.3, X = 1.6167, S.D. = 0.231 66). White males had higher age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates than white females. Black males had higher age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates than black females. Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates for cancer of the oral cavity were higher than the oral pharynx. The tongue and the tonsil had the highest anatomical s ites for age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates. The age-adjusted incidence rate increased in 2000 (23.3) but de clined in the following two years to (19). The national (SEER) oral cancer trends and NJSCR were consistent wi th finding from this study. Conclusion: Early screening and detection is needed to reduce the inciden ce and mortality rates for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx.- 11 -Sleep Issues Related to Psychological Stress Primary Author: Barbara Caldwell, PhD, APRN-BC School: School of Nursing Introduction : The proposed study addresses the compelling need for studies of sleep disturbance and its relationship to stress, mood disturbances and traumatic symptom s among inner city women of childbearing age. Sleep disturbance is common among women of childbearing age (Sc hweiger, Riemann, 2003). However, little is known about the characteristics of sleep patterns of childbearing women living in inner cities. It is likely that sleep disturbance in these women may contribute to the exa cerbation of mental health problems, including symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression (Harvey, Jones, & Sch midt, 2003). Methods : Our own preliminary data (Caldwell, 2002) indicate that inner city childbearing women suffer disproportionately from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disor der (PTSD) as did the study by Bassuk, Dawson, Perloff & Weinrib (2001). Approximately 35% of the low-income women had a lifetime incidence of PTSD, a rate about three times that of women of all ages in the National Com orbidity Survey completed by Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes and Nelson (1995). Sleep disturbance and psychia tric-mental health problems, including symptoms of trauma, depression, and anxiety, are frequently com orbid conditions (Orsillo et al, 1996). Results : A growing body of evidence suggests that sleep disturbance co ntributes to the development of these problems (Morin, & Ware, 1996; Saldotas, 1994; Koren, Arnon, La vie & Klein, 2002). Insomnia was a causative factor for depression and/or anxiety in a study by Ford & Kamer ow (1989). Insomnia of at least two weeks duration increases the lifetime risk for depression (Wingard & Berkman, 1989; Lustberg & Reynolds, 2000). Persistent sleep problems increase the risk of relapse and recu rrence of depressive episodes and the risk for suicide (Wingard, & Berkman, 1989; Fawcett, Schiftner, Fogg, et. al, 19 90). Breslau, Roth, Rosenthal, & Andreski (1996) found that 40% of those with insomnia and 46% of those with hyp ersomnia had a psychiatric disorder as compared to 16% of those with no sleep complaints. Conclusion : Soldators (1994) and Morin and Ware (1996) noted that individ uals with insomnia and co-occurring chronic stress could be at risk for the development of anxiety. Disturbed sleep is closely associated with stress, hyperarousal, disturbed mood, and symptoms of PTSD (American Ps ychiatric Association, 2000). Rothbaum and Mellman (2001) noted that if deprived of adequate sleep, one wo uld expect the trauma survivor to be more sensitized by, reactive to, and therefore more avoidant of, exp osures to reminders of the trauma, whereas a well- rested state would enhance the individuals capacity for coping. Krakow, Hollifield et al (2001) noted that sleep quality disruption for trauma victims will impair processing an d resolution of the trauma and increase anxiety.- 12 -Asthma in Pregnancy - Its Relationship with Race, Insurance, Maternal Education, And Prenatal Care Utilization Primary Author: Katherine Chung, MD, MPH Co-Author: Demissie K, Rhoads GG School: School of Public Health Objective : This study examines racial/ethnic disparities in the rate of asthma during pregnancy, and examines insurance type, maternal education, and prenatal care initiatio n/utilization as potential determinants of the disparities. Design and Setting : This historical cohort study utilizes the linked birth certif icates and maternal hospital claims data for all singleton live births to New Jersey residents in N ew Jersey hospitals in 1989-1993 (N=556,597). Results : Compared to whites, African-American (odds ratio, OR=1.56, 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1.44, 1.70) and Hispanic (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.49) mothers had elevated rates of asthma. Medicaid (OR=2.08, 95% CI: 1.87, 2.32) and Medicaid HealthStart (OR=2.23, 95% CI: 2.04, 2. 44) enrollees, compared to those with traditional indemnity coverage, were more likely to have asthma during preg nancy. When measures of socioeconomic status were included in the model, the effect of race decreased. Insur ance status was the most important of the socioeconomic factors and accounted for most of the racial/ethn ic disparity in African Americans and Hispanics. Conclusion : Insurance type as a possible indicator of socioeconomic statu s explains much of the racial disparity in asthma during pregnancy. Monitoring the quality of medical care for disadvantaged women may have a significant public health impact. Project Interact: A Model for Cultural and Interdisciplinary Training of Predoctoral Students Primary Osteopathic Medicine The UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine, Department of Family Medicine received a grant from the US Bureau of Health Professions to develop, integrate, implement, and evaluate an innovative cultural and interdisciplinary training program for predoctoral students uti lizing three components: curriculum, standardized patient lab, and clinical experiences. Eleven interactive curri culum modules and four clinical experiences were designed and integrated into the predoctoral curriculum. A two- week 3 rd year community service rotation was developed and implemented in partnership with the New Jersey Ar ea Health Education Center to allow students the opportunity to practice their cultural and interdisciplinary co mpetencies in medically underserved communities. Twelve standardized patient cases were developed and implemente d to assess students' cultural and interdisciplinary competencies in standardized patient encounte rs. Students completed three standardized patient encounters each year with specific tasks required for each case . A majority of the tasks were completed satisfactorily by 70% - 91% of the students. There were five ta sks that 50% to 70% of the students completed satisfactorily with two of these tasks requiring revision to th e curriculum based on student feedback.- 13 -Needless Deaths: Cervical cancer in Newark, Essex County NJ and the Nation Primary Author: Bernadette M. Cracchiolo, MD Co-Authors: Gabriela Kaplan, Cheryl Kennedy MD School: New Jersey Medical School Introduction: Death from cervical cancer is preventable by early screening. I t is well-documented that equal access to screening and treatment ensures equal survival irrespective of race or et hnicity1. We examined local trends in diagnosis and survival of cervical cancer with state and national statistics. Methods: SEER database statistics and data from the New Jersey State Can cer Registry were compared with data from the University Hospital Tumor Registry and United States Census dat a. Results:Nationwide the disparity in the relative 5-year survival rates from cancer of African-American versus Caucasian patients is increasing: Between 1974 and 1997, disparity more t han doubled, and is presently increasing linearly. The relative 5-year survival rates of African-American women wi th cervical cancer is decreasing, from 64% in 1974 to 58% in 1997, with projected disparity predicted to exce ed 21% by 2006. These trends are even more pronounced within our Gynecological Oncology Service at Univers ity Hospital, New Jersey Medical School, Newark. In 2000, cancer of the cervix was the most common new c ancer diagnosis at University Hospital at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark. 60% of the newly diagnosed cases were in African-American women and 24% in Hispanic women, with a significant proportion presenting at advanced stages of disease. We thus examined cervical cancer rates in Newark / Essex County and compared them with the state of New Jersey and the Nation as a whole. We also examined what factors may ha ve contributed to the still-increasing rates we observe in Essex County today. We found that during the early e ighties, funding cuts in citywide preventive health initiatives had markedly reduced Pap screening in Newark. Subse quently, cervical cancer rates increased from 8.7 in 1988 to 13.9 in 1992. Cases more than doubled among African- American women in Essex County at the same time, and they experienced twice the rate of invasive disease o f age-matched Caucasians 2. Diagnosis of local disease (curable) was distinctly less common in Essex County than at the state or the national level (43% vs. 47% and 52% of all cases, respectively). Statewi de, 72% of cervical cancers in Caucasians were diagnosed while still in situ, compared with only 61% of cervic al cancers in African-American and 67% in Hispanic women. This results in a higher age-adjusted mortality rate from cervical cancer in Essex County (4.8/100,000) than at the state (2.8/100,000) and national leve l 2.7/100,000 women). Years-of-potential-life-lost (YPLL) before age 65 is thus 72% higher in Essex County than in the state of NJ as a whole. The burden of death by this mostly curable disease is dispropor tionately borne by minority women in New Jersey, with race/ethnicity specific mortality rates of 2.3/100,000 wom en among Caucasians, versus 6.3 in African- Americans and 4.1 in Hispanic women. Conclusion: The continuing trend in racial/ethnic disparities in death from cervical cancer is alarming, and requires targeted interventions by local, state, and federal authorities. Supported by the UMDNJ Foundation (19-99) 1Farley et al., Cancer 91, p869; 2001. 2-Holland et al., Am J Pub Health 83, p45; 1992- 14 -Mixed Parental Race: High Risk For N, Demissie K. School: School of Public Health Objective : The authors examined the association between parental race an d adverse fetal and infant outcomes. Methods : A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the U.S. li nked birth/infant death dataset between 1995 and 2001. The study was restricted to singleton births at =>20 weeks, and fetuses weighing =>500g (n=21,005,786). Rates of fetal and infant outcomes were examin ed. Parental race was categorized as: mother white-father white (WW), mother white-father black (WB), mother black-father white (BW), and mother black- father black (BB). Multivariable logistic regression analysis w as performed to examine the association between parental race and rates of stillbirth, early- (<7days), late- ( 7-27 days) and deaths, and small for gestational age (SGA) births after controlling for co nfounding variables. Results : Although risks varied with parental race categories, stillbir th was associated with a higher-than-expected risk for inter-racial couples; WB, (95% CI: 1.21, 1.52) compared when both parents being whites. The RR for stillbirths was even much higher where both parents were blacks, RR: 1.70 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.75). The overall pattern of the RRs for t he 5th and 10 th percentile, SGA, and early-neonatal mortality was similar to that seen for stillbirths. Mixed race parents present with similar risk of post-neonatal infant mortality. Conclusion : Both maternal and paternal race appear to be associated with risks of stillbirth and infant mortality. Racial Differences in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer: A Com parison Of Surgical and Radiation Therapy between Whites and Blacks Primary Author: Kitaw School: School of Public Health Objective: To evaluate black to white differences in treatment for colore ctal cancer. Methods : Only whites or blacks diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer b etween 1988 and 1997 were identified from SEER database. Results: A total of 106,377 (91.3% white, 50.5% male) patients formed t he study population. The vast majority of these patients received standard cancer treatment. Although the number of subjects who did not receive such treatment was small, their proportion was higher among blacks t han among whites. The odds of non-receipt of surgical treatment was higher among blacks than whites for stag e I (OR = 2.08, 95% CI, 1.41, 3.03 among males; OR = 2.38, 95% CI, 1.69, 3.45 among females) and stage IV colon cancer (OR = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.01, 1.56 among males; OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.14, 1.72 among females). A similar pattern was also seen for most stages of rectal cancer.Conclusion : Most black and white colorectal cancer patients received stan dard treatment. Although the number of subjects without standard treatment was small, their proportion was higher among blacks than among whites. Blacks were also more likely to refuse recommended treatment. E fforts in educating black patients about the benefits of treatment may help to eliminate the remaining racia l disparity.- 15 -Trends in Childhood Asthma: Ambulatory Care, Hospitalization, and MD, PhD Co-Author: Heather O'Kelly School: School of Public Health Objective : To study trends in ambulatory care, hospitalization, and anti -asthma medication for asthma in children by age and race categories. Methods: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Hosp ital Ambulatory Care Survey, and the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the years 1995-2002 were used to examine trends in ambulatory care, hospitalization, and anti-asthma medication in which the primar y diagnosis was asthma for children between 0-17 years of age. United States Census Bureau population estimates were used as the denominator. Change in rates for ambulatory care, hospitalization, and anti-asthma medication be tween the years 1995-1996 and 2001-2002 were calculated. Results : Visits to physician offices for asthma decreased 30% among b lacks (55/1,000 in 1995-96 to 38/1,000 in 2001-02) and increased whites (48/1,000 in 1995-96 to 64/1,000 in 2001-02).Use of controller medication increased 183% among blacks (7/1,000 in 1995-96 to 1 9/1,000 in 2001-02) and increased among whites (13/1,000 in 1995-96 to 33/1,000 in 2001-02). Use of rel iever medication decreased 45% among blacks (50/1,000 in 1995-96 to 28/1,000 in 2001-02) while it remained unchanged among whites (40/1,000 in 1995-96 to 39/1,000 in 2001-02). Among blacks, 22% (71/10,000 in 1995-96 to 55/10,000 in 2001- 02), while emergency department visits increased slightly (26/1 ,000 in 1995-96 to 28/1,000 in 2001-02). Among whites, emergency department visits decreased 16% (7/1,000 in 1 995-96 to 6/1,000 in 10% (17/10,000 in 1995-96 to 16/10,000 in 2001-02).Conclusion : Increased use of controllers by black children is associated with a decrease in hospitalization during the study period. Increased use of controllers by white childr en is associated with a decrease in hospitalization and emergency room visits during the study period.- 16 -Trends in Preterm Birth and Neonatal Mortality Among Blacks And Whites In the United States from 1989 To 1997 Primary Author: Kitaw Demissie, MD, PhD Co-Authors: Rhoads GG, Kramer MS, Kogan MD, Joseph KS. School: School of Public Health Introduction : Preterm birth, a major determinant of infant mortality, has b een increasing in recent years. Methods : The authors examined trends in preterm birth and its determin ants by using the US birth and infant death files for 1989-1997. The impact of trends in preterm birth rate s on neonatal and infant mortality was also evaluated. Results : Among Whites, preterm births (<37 completed weeks of gestatio n) increased from 8.8% of live births in 1989 to 10.2% in 1997, a relative increase of 15.6%. On the oth er hand, preterm births among Blacks decreased by 7.6% (from 19.0% to 17.5%) during the same period. An increase in obstetric interventions contributed to increases in preterm births for both races but was outweighed by other un identified favorable influences for Blacks. Neonatal mortality among preterm Whites dropped 34% during the 8 years o f the study, while the decrease was only 24% among Blacks. This large disparity countered the changes in pre term birth rates so that the percentage decline in neonatal mortality was similar in the two racial groups (18-20% ). Conclusion : The anticipated mortality benefit from a lower preterm birth rate for Blacks has been blunted by suboptimal improvement in mortality among the remaining preterm infants. The widening race gap in mortality among preterm infants merits attention. Genetic Issues in Oral Health Disparities Research Primary Author: Scott Diehl, PhD School: New Jersey Dental School The still-challenging question of nature versus nurture will be explored in the context of a brief review of what we know about the causes of several oral and craniofacial diseases . Disparities in disease prevalence, severity and outcome exist for a severe form of periodontitis that affects t eenagers and young adults. Infections by pathogenic oral bacteria are clearly involved in development of this disea se, but how our bodies respond biologically to infection is also very important. There are also differences in disease risk for the birth defect cleft lip and palate and for oral cancer, diseases caused by a complex interaction betwe en inherited (genetic) and environmental risk factors (such as nutrition, smoking and alcohol exposures). Responses t o pain medications used in dentistry and for other conditions differ substantially among racial and ethnic groups. For most common diseases and disorders, there is no simple yes/no answer to the question of what role biology and e nvironment play in disease risk and response to treatment, as there is usually a highly complex interaction of factors that need to be carefully explored.- 17 -Racial Differences in the Epidemiology of Sepsis in New Jersey Primary Author: Viktor Y. Dombrovskiy, MD, PhD, MPH Co-Authors: A.A.Martin, J.Sunderram, and H.L.Paz School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Introduction: This study was designed to evaluate differences in the rates of hospitalization, mortality, and case fatality for sepsis between white and black adults in New Jerse y and, if so, to find the possible causes for these disparities. Methods: All cases of sepsis were collected from the 1995-2002 New Jerse y State Inpatient Databases (SID) that contain information on all hospital discharges in the state. To calculate rates of hospitalization and population based mortality, we used population estimates as denominators and 200 0 Census data as a standard for direct standardization while performing trend analysis. Hospital case fatality rates were computed as number of deaths/number of cases expressed as a percentage and normalized to the hospitalized population distribution in New Jersey in 2000.Results: A total of 233,432 patients with sepsis, including 87,675 those with severe sepsis were hospitalized in New Jersey in 1995-2002. Whites and blacks accounted for 86.6% of hospitalization. For each year reviewed, the rates of severe sepsis hospitalization and population based mor tality (per 100,000 population) in blacks were significantly greater than in whites, both males and females. T hus, in 1995 age-adjusted rates of hospitalization were 217.91+8.28 and 141.85+ 2.69 in black and white males, respectively (P<0.0001), and 186 .81+7.03 and 137.87+2.52 in black and white females, respectively (P<0.0001) . Population based mortality rates at this time were 112.65+5.96 and 72.59+ 1.93 (P<0.0001) in black and white males, respectively, and 95. 26+5.03 and 71.55+ 1.82 (P<0.0001) in black and white females, respectively. During the study period, both these rates significantly increased but they remained considerably greater in blacks vers us whites. However, we could not find differences in hospital case fatality rates for severe sepsis between black s and whites, both males and females. Moreover, from 1995 to 2002, case fatality rates decreased both in black and w hites patients and remained similar. Using the same database for 2002, we performed a more comprehensive analysis o f cases of sepsis to identify possible explanations for these racial disparities. The association between sepsis an d diabetes as well as HIV infection is well known. We found that blacks with sepsis compared to white patients were 1 .7 times more likely to have diabetes (95% CI= 1.56-1.78) and 1.4 times more likely to have obesity (95% CI= 1 .14-1.75). The likelihood of having HIV infection in black patients was 19.6 times greater than in whites (95% CI = 16.2-23.6). In concordance with that, blacks were younger than whites: the average age of black patients with sep sis in our data was 61.6+0.25 years compared to 72.8+0.11 years in white patients (P<0.0001). Among whites with sepsis, only 24.9% of subjects were younger than 65 years old whereas among blacks this proportion was twice gre ater - 52.2%. Blacks with sepsis were 4.0 times more likely to be uninsured compared to whites (95% CI= 3.44-4. 56) and were 1.4 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital through the emergency room (95% CI= 1.27-1.50). Finally, blacks have greater risk of sepsis than whites. In adults, the relative risk of sepsis in blacks versus whites in age group 18-34 years was 3.5 (95% CI= 3.05-3.96). It rose to 4.4 (95% CI= 3.93-4.82) in age group 35- 44 years and then steadily decreased to 1.7 (95% CI=1.58-1.87) in persons at age 85 years old and above.Conclusion: There is a significant increase in the hospitalization and mor tality rates for severe sepsis in black adults compared to whites, and this difference is stable over t ime. However, case fatality rates are similar for both races. The greater incidence of sepsis in black population may be partially explained by the disparities in the disease prevention and care of preexisting conditions.- 18 -The Transition of African American Women on Public Assistance t o Economic Self-Sufficiency: A Qualitative Study of Cultural Resiliency as Related to Posit ive Psychology Primary Author: Robin Eubanks, PhD School: School of Health Related Professions African American women have a remarkable ability to effectively cope and survive in diverse and hostile environments. However, minimal attention has been given to thei r stories about resilience, that is, how they manage their environmental and sociocultural resources so that they ar e able to move beyond survival to actively thrive and enjoy life. The study is propelled by concerns for the African American female population in New Jersey, as they experience the impact of the welfare reform phenomenon. The int entions and results of welfare reform can not be seen as a cure-all for poverty. More information is needed abo ut these families over time. Although it seems to be the American public opinion that all poor mothers should simply get a job, it is just as important to examine the unstable life and risk factors associated with living on low wa ges. Those that leave the welfare system still have substantial needs not only financial but also educational, phys ical, and psychological. The purpose of this study is to describe the process of resilience in this population of Afr ican American women who have successfully left the welfare system to become employed. A womanist ethnography was used to gather and interpret the stories of nine African American women. Interviews were taped and transcribed for content analysis and major themes were developed. Concepts from a Black feminist theoretical perspective were use d to facilitate non-exploitive research and examine hidden agendas, power imbalances and assumptions. A qualitative method of research was conducted to yield valuable exploration and explanations of processes including a naturalistic inquiry method and the ethnographic interview was employed for data collection. Nine African Ameri can women were interviewed with an age range from twenty-seven to forty-eight. The data analysis led to the identification of three primary themes, with twelve sub-themes, emerging from the data. The primary themes are as f ollows: (a) The Welfare system was viewed as a \"mixed blessing\", (b) Participants identified diverse support s ystems that made their sustainability and transitional process successful, and (c) Specific transitional experiences w ere identified that impacted level of resiliency, motivation, and self-confidence. Knowledge generated by this research will increase understandin g of resilience and the impact of the transitional process for African American women from welfare to work. Such k nowledge would be instrumental in the (a) design of culturally appropriate welfare-to-work programs that may foster resiliency for women, and (b) identification of culturally appropriate resources that may pro mote resiliency.- 19 -Mechanisms for Learning: Residency Curricula in Mental Health, Cultural Competency and Palliative Care Primary Author: Frank A. Filipetto, D.O. School of Osteopathic Medicine The UMDNJ, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Department of Family Medicine is developing new curricula in Mental Health, Cultural Competency and Palliative Care for the Family Medicine Residency Program. Project faculty will identify the competencies (knowledge, skills and a ttitudes/behaviors) needed by residents in each of the following areas: mental health, cultural competency and palliat ive care. Each of these three training areas will be addressed via specific training modalities, including WebCT, St andardized Patient exercises and clinical experiences. Late-Life Depression among Black and White Homecare Patients Primary Author: of Public Health 1Department of Psychiatry, Weill Medical College of Cornell Univ ersity, White Plains, NY 10605 Objective : Depression is prevalent in later life and associated with neg ative outcomes when untreated. Homecare (HC) provides important care for medically and functionally fra il older adults. Little is known about the racial differences in the prevalence and correlates of depression amon g HC patients. This study compared the prevalence and risk factors of depression as well as the prescription rate s of antidepressant medication among Black and White HC patients. Method : As part of an epidemiological study of the prevalence of depre ssion in HC, this study randomly sampled Black (n=56) and White (n=458) newly admitted HC patients. Majo r and minor depression was assessed using SCID interviews and medical records. Prescription rates of anti depressants were obtained from medical records and in-home prescriptions.Results : The prevalence of depression among Black patients was 19.6% and 26.4% among White patients (2=1.201, p=.273). Sociodemographic, medical and functional corre lates of depression were similar in both racial groups. Both groups expressed similar clinical patterns of symp toms. Among depressed patients, only 16.7% of Black patients and 32.0% of White patients were prescribed anti depressant medication. Conclusion : Similarities in prevalence, symptoms, correlates of depressio n were observed across Black and White HC patients. Only a minority of depressed HC patients received antidepressant medication, however, Black HC patients were less likely to be prescribed antidepressant medic ations. These results suggest that both groups are in need of effective treatment to reduce the burden of depression; however, these treatment disparities are particularly severe for Black HC patients. Further investigation will examin e factors that moderate treatment initiation and adherence among HC patients.- 20 -Dispelling the Myth That Thrombophilia Is Less Common In Ethnic Minorities Primary Author: Lisa Gittens-Williams, MD Co-Authors: Anthony Al-Khan MD, Joseph Apuzzio, MD School: New Jersey Medical School Introduction : Thrombophilia, the tendency towards excessive coagulation of the blood, is a common condition, affecting as many as 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 people. The combination of a constitutional predisposition to increased coagulation, combined with pregnancy is associated with a varie ty of adverse pregnancy outcomes, because pregnancy is already characterized by increased pro-coagulant v ersus fibrinolytic activity. Available literature suggests that the association between adverse pregnancy outcome and thrombophilias, either inherited or acquired, is most pronounced in women of European ancestry, and relativel y rare in Hispanic or Black women. Because University Hospital has a high incidence of adverse pregnancy o utcome, we tested whether, in our diverse patient population, previously undiagnosed thrombophilias might be asso ciated with some proportion of poor pregnancy outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 100 patients who were screened for thrombophilia after a prior adverse pregnancy outcome in 2003 (adverse outcomes were severe preeclampsia, unexplained stillbirth and deep vein thrombosis). The patients were tested for deficiency of Antithrombin 3 (activity assay), Protein C (activity assay), Protein S (activity assay), for the Factor V Leiden mutation (DNA), hyperhomocysteinemia and for the acquired antiphospholipid syndrome (Lupus anticoagulant or anti-c ardiolipin antibodies). Of these 100 patients, 64 were Black, 13 were Hispanic, 9 were white and 14 were of mi xed or \"other\" ethnicity. Results: In contrast to the widely cited literature showing that geneti c coagulation defects are relatively rare in minority populations, we found that 32% of our series of 100 wo men with adverse pregnancy outcome had an inherited thrombophilia. The frequency of these disorders by et hnicity/race was 31% of the Black women, 36% of the Hispanic women, 23% of the white women, and 35% of the \"mix ed\" or \"other\" ethnicity group. The frequency of thrombophilic disorders was, in ascending order, Antithrombi n 3, Protein S deficiency, Factor V Leiden and hyperhomocysteinemia. In this small study there were no differ ences in the frequency of these disorders between ethnic groups. Conclusion : We concluded from this data that the prevalence of thrombophi lia is not as low as thought among minority women in our population and that the bulk of cases are due to inherited, not acquired thrombophilias. The category of \"mixed and \"other\" require further investigation, a s the population we serve is ethnically diverse and these might well represent subsets of women from particular cou ntries who do not consider themselves Black or African-American or as generically Hispanic.- 21 -Ethnic Disparities in the Development of Insulin Resistance Leading To Gestational Diabetes Primary Authors: Lisa Gittens-Williams, MD Co-Authors: Stacy Zamudio, Ph.D., Nicholas Illsley, D.Phil. School: Jersey Medical School Introduction : Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes whi ch is only observed in pregnancy and occurs when a mother's insulin resistance increases over the no rmal, pregnant level. GDM has a number of perinatal consequences but the most important of these is its e ffect on fetal growth. Fetal overgrowth is the primary growth defect, observed with increased frequency in GDM. The sp ectrum of clinical problems caused by gestational diabetes is also wider than has been traditionally recognized. In addition to the short term, perinatal effects, there are a range of longer term consequences of GDM f or both mother and offspring. Mothers who have GDM are at an increased risk for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. The offspring of GDM pregnancies have an increased risk for obesity later in life, especially th ose who were large at birth. They also have a higher risk for type 2 diabetes and GDM, thus producing a potential mechani sm for non-genomic, intergenerational transmission of diabetes. An increased incidence of GDM in Hisp anics and African-Americans compared to non- Hispanic whites has been documented in a number of studies, and both have an increased risk of giving birth to a large infant (\u00ff 4000 g), for a recurrent GDM pregnancy and for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes themselves. Research in non-pregnant subjects has shown that th ere are significant variations in insulin resistance between ethnic groups, with higher values for Hispanics and Afr ican-Americans. Despite these observations, the effects of ethnic differences on insulin resistance during preg nancy have not been addressed. Aims : The aims are to determine the association between insulin res istance and fetal growth in normal and GDM pregnancies of non-Hispanic white, African-American and Hispani c women Methods : The proposed study will recruit non-Hispanic white, African-A merican and Hispanic women with normal pregnancies and those at high risk for GDM. Measurements will be made of fetal growth and insulin resistance at weeks 12-16, 20-24 and 28-32 of pregnancy. Insuli n resistance will be measured using a modification of the standard 3-hr oral glucose tolerance test. Results : We will compare the extent and duration of changes in materna l insulin resistance between the three ethnic groups to determine the correlation between: Insulin resistance and fetal growth in normal and GDM pregnanc ies Whether insulin resistance is greater in African-Americans and Hispanics then non-white Hispanics at various time points during pregnancy (12-32 weeks) If changes in insulin resistance occur earlier in pregnancy or are of greater duration in African-Americans and HispanicsConclusion : The data we obtain from this project will enable us to determ ine if development of insulin resistance in normal and GDM pregnancies differs between non-Hispanic whit e, African-American and Hispanic women. If, as we expect, there are significant differences, this informati on will help us devise population-specific programs to monitor insulin resistance in women at high risk of GDM and to develop specific therapeutic preventive programs.

The prima ry goal of both is to enhance skills in communicating with Limited English Proficient (LEP) and hearing impaired and deaf patients with the help of interpreters. Both models include a didactic component and a pr actical role-play component. The workshops are co- taught by a health educator, family practice physician, a train ed interpreter and speech and hearing specialist. One model is a two-hour workshop including small group role-plays. The other is a one-hour workshop followed by a formative OSCE (Objective Standardized Clinical Experience) sta tion in which students practice skills one-on-one with a patient via an interpreter. Methods : The objectives of the workshops are to: discuss the rationale for using trained interpreters and risks of not using them; to become familiar with tools for communicating with deaf/hearing- impaired patients; to make use of an interviewing tool (ETHNIC) for eliciting cultural health beliefs and practices' and to be able to utilize techniques for communicating with (LEP) patients via trained an d untrained interpreters. The objectives are accomplished through multiple methods including discussion of v ideotape vignettes, demonstration of a phone- interpreter service and the practice of skills learned. Results : In the small group role-play students take turns interviewing a bilingual individual playing the role of a \"patient\" via an \"untrained interpreter\". The \"patient\" bases his/her portrayal on a written case. The case has varied but one depicts a patient presenting with stomach pain ( symptoms of GIRD). He/she has been taking a \"digestif\" with high alcohol content which is contributing to t he problem. Interpreters are instructed to act as if they are untrained by having side-conversations with the patient or not interpreting everything that is said either by the patient or doctor. Utilizing the skills they've learned in work ing with interpreters, approximately 5 participants per group, acting as clinicians, practice making a diagnosis and de veloping a treatment plan using ETHNIC. Following the role-play, the groups debrief their experience. The biling ual individuals may be students or residents in the class or people recruited from outside the class. The 2 hour wo rkshop has been taught as part of the family medicine clerkship for each rotating group of 20 medical studen ts. It has also been taught to residents (and faculty). Conclusion : More recently, the workshop has been taught as part of the \"I ntroduction to the Clerkship\" course provided at the beginning of the academic year for all entering RWJMS 3 rd year medical students. It includes a one-hour workshop followed by a \"working with interpreters\" OSC E station. As part of the formative OSCE, students receive feedback from the simulated patient and interp reter and a faculty preceptor. Feedback on the workshops and OSCE has been uniformly positive.

Hudson, PhD Co-Authors: Barbara DiCicco-Bloom, MPH; John Scott, PhD; Benjamin Crabtree, PhD School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Recent advances in diagnostic and treatment technologies have p roduced great opportunities to decrease morbidity and mortality from a variety of cancers such as breast, cervica l, colorectal, and prostate cancers. These are cancers that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority popul ations. This study examines disparities in the implementation of cancer screening guidelines in primary care s ettings. Specifically, the study aims to: (1) describe cancer screening disparities in New Jersey primary care practic es, (2) examine differences in cancer screening disparities across different types of practices, and (3) identi fy characteristics of practices that have greater or fewer screening disparities using a qualitative comparative case anal ysis. Data collection was conducted in 22 primary care practices across NJ. Primary data sources for the study in clude medical record reviews (N=1,756), organizational climate surveys from practice staff and clinicia ns (N=219), practice information forms, and qualitative field notes that describe organizational characteri stics of the practices approximately 50 single spaced pages per practice. Physician Views about Clinical Trials for Cancer Research: Examining Barriers to Clinical Trial Accrual Primary Author: Shawna V. Hudson, PhD Co-Authors: Mary Todd, DO; Howard Leventhal, PhD School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Nationally, participation rates for cancer clinical trials amon g adult patients who are eligible are low, ranging from 3 to 5%. New Jersey enrollment rates for eligible patients are comparable, ranging from 2 to 4% for cancer clinical trials. While increased enrollment is a priority, increasing a ccess to members of the medically underserved is also critical. This study collected self-reported data about physic ian referral patterns for cancer clinical trials. A random stratified sample of 103 community physicians including oncolog ists, family practice doctors, internal medicine doctors, obstetricians/gynecologists, surgeons, and urologists were surveyed. Physicians in the study were recruited from hospitals affiliated with The Cancer Institute of New Jers ey, the states only NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Half of the physicians were recruited from five hospitals that have significant numbers of diagnosed racial and/or ethnic minority cancer patients as defined by the NJ State Cancer Registry. The other half practice at hospitals with low numbers of diagnosed racial and/or ethnic mi nority cancer patients.- 24 -The Brotherhood Health Initiative Primary Author: Robert L. Johnson, MD, FAAP School: New Jersey Medical School Young minority men in the United States die nearly seven years younger than women, and suffer from more chronic diseases and have higher mortality rates for all 15 lea ding causes of death. Many of these adverse outcomes are related to the choice of or participation in a variety of a dverse health behaviors. Minority males have rates of serious suicide attempts during high school years that are 25% higher than that of minority females and 113% higher than that for white males. The minority male is twice as likely as the white male and three times as likely as the minority female to have tried marijuana before the age of 1 3. The minority male is three times as likely as the minority female and four times as likely as the white male to h ave sexual intercourse before the age of 13.The minority male is twice as likely as the white male and nine tim es as likely as the minority female to carry a gun. An Intensive Case Management Model (i.e. emergency financial as sistance, housing, transportation, legal services, childcare, buddy/companion services, focused health education a nd counseling, assistance with entitlements, etc.) has been demonstrated to effectively mitigate the barriers that impede effective treatment and compliance for individuals with chronic illnesses such as HIV, Asthma and Diab etes. The Brotherhood Health Initiative is a health services research project that seeks to demonstrat e that an adapted multifaceted intensive case managed healthcare model can mitigate health disparities among young minority men through the improvement of their participation in and utilizati on of comprehensive health services. This effort is funded through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's New Jersey Health Initiative Program.- 25 -Common Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) 19bp Deletion Factor for Preterm Delivery (PTD) Primary Author: William Johnson, MD School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Background: Folate is a critical requirement for cell division, a major fea ture of in utero development. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is required to convert the folic acid used in supplements and for food fortification and the dihydrofolate produced by thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) during DNA synthesis to the reduced folate forms used by the cell. Objective: To determine if a common, recently discovered DHFR deletion pol ymorphism was a risk factor for preterm delivery or low birth weight. Design: We studied 324 gravidas from Camden during pregnancy. The intak e of folate was computed from folate supplement intake plus the mean of two 24-hour recalls during t he course of pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted from gravidas' leukocytes and genotyped. Results: Gravidas with a deletion allele had a significantly greater ris k of preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-8.8, p<0.05) compared with those without a deletion allele. Gravidas with both a DHFR deletion allele and low folate intake (<400mg/day from diet plu s supplements) had significantly greater risk of preterm delivery (AOR 5.5, 95% CI 1.5 - 20.4, p=0.01) and a sig nificantly greater risk of low birth weight (AOR 8.3, 95% CI 1.8 - 38.6, p=0.01) compared to gravidas without a deletion allele and intake >400ug/day. Conclusion: The DHFR 19bp deletion allele may be a risk factor for PTD. In the presence of low dietary folate, the allele may also be a risk factor for both PTD and LBW. This may be a gene-environment interaction.- 26 -The Experiences of Korean Men's Smoking and Quitting Primary Author: Sun Seog Kim, PhD, RN, CS Co-Authors: Haein Son, Kyoung A. Nam School: School of Nursing The purpose of this study was to identify personal, social, and cultural factors affecting smoking behavior among Korean male immigrants in the United States. Participants were 11 current and 11 former cigarette smokers who resided in New York City. The participants attended one of four focus groups and talked about their experiences of smoking initiation, changes in smoking behavior over time, smok ing in Korea and the United States, strategies used for smoking cessation, and suggestions for a smoking cessation program. The focus group interviews were audio taped and transcribed verbatim. Culture, gender, addiction, hea lth, and age emerged as the major themes reflecting factors that influence Korean men's smoking initiation, mainten ance, and cessation. The first two are sociocultural factors and the remaining three are personal factors. Smoking i s a common thread in Korean men's social world and a prime component of Korean men's gender identity. The thre e personal factors affected individual differences in the experiences of smoking behavior that had changed from a social practice to nicotine addiction. Korean men's experiences in relation to addiction were similar to those repo rted in other racial/ethnic groups, whereas the dramatic change in the perception of smoking-related health ris ks coming with their forties, some cessation strategies used by former smokers, and preference for group mee tings over individual counseling appeared to be specific to Korean men.

Like, MD, MS Co Authors: Mark C. Fulcomer PhD, Jo Ann Kairys MPH, Kimberly D. Wathington BA, School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Context: Cultural competence has been proposed as a key strategy for he lping to reduce racial and ethnic health care disparities. The Future of Family Medicine Report recommen ds that family physicians improve their ability to provide more culturally proficient care. Objective: Does a cultural competency training program result in improved physician knowledge, skills, attitudes, and comfort levels relating to the care of patients from divers e backgrounds? Design: Longitudinal study employing self-administered questionnaires Setting: Two urban family practice centers affiliated with a medical school. Participants: Fifteen of the 17 faculty physicians at the 2 practice sites c ompleted the study. Socio-demographic characteristics included: mean age : and 73% attende d medical school in the United States. Intervention/Instrument: A Clinical Cultural Competency Questionnaire was administered before and after a Cultural Competency for Health Care Providers Training Program consisting of five 1.5-hour seminars over an 8 month period. Main and Secondary Outcome Measure(s): Physician knowledge, skills, attitudes, and comfort levels relating to the delivery of culturally competent health careResults: Pre- and post-test changes in physician's self-assessments usi ng correlated t-tests. Seven of the 16 knowledge items, 8 of the 15 skills items, and 4 of the 12 comf ort in encounters items demonstrated statistically significant improvements (14 at p < .05 and 5 at p < .01). Over all satisfaction with the training program was 3.7 on a 5-point Likert scale. Conclusion : Despite the small number of participating physicians, there i s strong evidence of self-rated improvement in cultural competency. It is unclear, however, if these positive changes can be directly attributed to the training intervention given the lack of a control group and the influence of other organizational and environmental factors. Implications of this Aetna Foundation-fu nded study for cultural competency education and research will be discussed.

Like, MD, MS Co-Authors: Mark C. Fulcomer PhD, Jo Ann Kairys MPH, Kimberly D. Wathington BA, Jesse Crosson PhD School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Providing more culturally competent health care has been propos ed as a key strategy for reducing racial and ethnic health disparities. This Aetna Foundation-funded project addres sed the following four questions: What are the views and perspectives of physicians, staff, and patients on addressing the Office of Minority Health's National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically A ppropriate Services (CLAS) in Health Care in a family practice setting? Does a cultural competency training program result in improved physician knowledge, skills, attitudes, and comfort levels relating to the care of patients from diverse ba ckgrounds? What impact does patient request fulfillment have on patient s atisfaction with cross-cultural Clinical encounters? How were participatory quality improvement activities and meth ods utilized to address the care of patients from diverse backgrounds? Four substudies employing qualitative and quantitative methods were carried out at two urban academic family medicine practices in Central New Jersey: Substudy 1. Addressing the CLAS Standards - Four Depth Intervie ws were held with the Medical Directors and Practice Managers; and six Focus Group Interviews were conducte d with physicians, staff, and patients at the two study sites. Substudy 2. Increasing Clinical Cultural Competency - A Cultural Competency for Health Care Providers Training Program , a series of five, 1.5 hour interactive seminars and workshops was presented to faculty physicians, residents, and medical students over an eight-month period. A Clinical Cultural Competency Questionnaire (CCCQ) was administered prior to and one year after training to 17 fa culty physicians from the two practice sites.Substudy 3. Providing Patient-Centered Care - A trend analysis design was utilized, and two self-administered surveys, the Patient Request for Services Schedule (PRFSS) and Patient Services Received Schedule (PSRS) were completed by 1,004 patients at the two study sites immediately prior to and after clinical encounters over a fifteen- month period. Substudy 4. Improving Quality in Primary Care Practice Settings - Field notes were kept and participant observation carried out during a series of six facilitated Part icipatory Quality Improvement (PQI) team meetings held at each of the two practice sites after the cultural compe tency training was completed. Our study revealed important and significant findings about the complexity and multifaceted dimensions of addressing clinical and organizational cultural competence in p rimary care practice settings.

We are conducting a large-scale longitudinal study of dental health of Newark NJ school childre n aged 11-17. We will determine the prevalence of caries in the community and identify teeth with early lesions t hat would benefit from preventive measures. Methods : 535 children were examined in a mobile dental van. Followin g prophlaxis charting of decayed, missing and filled teeth was performed by mirror/explorer examination. The permanent molars were dried and examined with transillumination to determine the presence of white, or b rown-gray subsurface discolorations indicative of early decay. Results: Examination of molars revealed that 43.9% had probe detectabl e lesions and 74% had discolorations as determined by transillumination. Based on the whole mouth chart ing, 59% of the population had at least one decayed tooth. 32% of the population had between 3-9 decayed su rfaces and 6% had 10 or more decayed surfaces. 2.4% were entirely free of restorations or lesions of any kind. African-American children constituted 37.4% of the population and Hispanics 53.5%. However, of the students with 3 or more probe detectable cavities, 56.4% were African-American (significantly higher than expected by Chi Squ are analysis p = 0.0009) and 40% Hispanics (significantly lower than expected by Chi Square analysis p = 0 .0009). Conclusion: The proportion of children in this population having at least one decayed tooth exceeds that reported in the recent Surgeon General's report on oral health. Disparit y also exists between ethnic groups. The incidence of early decay is underestimated due to lack of radiographs. A lar ge number of subjects had occlusal surfaces with white or dark discolorations indicating early decay. This popul ation will be followed over a 3-year period with repeat examinations, radiographs and evaluation with various ca ries detector devices.

McNeal, PhD, APRN, BC School: School of Nursing, Newark As this nation becomes increasingly more culturally diverse and seeks to compete in a global health care market, it is incumbent upon the nursing profession to prepare high-tech h omecare nurses who are experts in their ability to make appropriate culturologic assessments of the clients for wh om they provide care. The culturologically competent high-tech homecare nurse is one who is able to obtain value-free culturologic information, and who utilizes that information in the development of culturally sens itive plans of care. This article has provided a framework, with supporting rationale, to assist the high-tech h omecare nurse in the gathering of culture-specific data from clients whose care delivery occurs in the richly dive rse home setting.

McNeal, PhD, APRN, BC School : School of Nursing The purpose of this investigation, using case study methodology , was to explore the end of life issues and to give meaning to the biopsychosocial experiences of the study partici pant, an adult African American female patient diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis. Two theoretical frameworks were used to guide the investigation of the study: Kubler-Ross Model of the Stages of Dying and the Conceptual Fra mework for Palliative Care Practice. Data analysis included review of medical records and patient journal s, interviews, observations and clinical assessment. The findings indicated that end of life issues can be articulat ed within the context of a palliative care framework and that the biopsychosocial experiences of the dying person ac quire meaning when situated within life history, ethical values and metaphysical belief systems.

The ethnic composition of people in this country is becoming in creasingly diverse. Massachusetts and, in particular, the city of Worcester is also experiencing changes in the diver sity of its population. These trends testify to the great need for APNs who are sensitive to and competent to care for cu lturally diverse populations. To address these changes, specific curricula enhancements focused on ethnically diverse populations were implemented for the nurse practitioner specialties at the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN ), University of Massachusetts Worcester. The processes used for this project included visiting community and clinical sites, identifying key curricular components, and evaluating existing didactic and clinical learn ing experiences. The GSN faculty developed a systematic plan for integrating these components into the gradu ate nursing core, advanced practice core, and specialty courses of the respective curricula. A major outcome of this project was the enhanced preparation of APN students to meet the multifaceted needs of ethnically diverse p atients, families, and communities.

McNeal, PhD, APRN, BC School: School of Nursing The primary purposes of this study were: (a) to examine the rel ationships among factors associated with organizational culture and the scholarly productivity of Africa n American women nurse faculty teaching at historically black (HBCUs) and predominantly white colleges and universities (PWCUs) and, (b) to compare the differences in African American women nurse faculty productivit y at HBCUs and PWCUs. Data were collected using a two-part survey, mailed to the campus addresses of 467 African American nurse faculty. A 31.5% response rate (N = 147) was achieved. A variety of scales using multiple statistical techniques were employed to analyze the data sets. McNeal, GJ.

Journal of Cultural Diversity . 7:4, 114-127 African American Nurse Faculty Satisfaction and Scholarly Produ ctivity At Predominantly White and Historically Black Colleges and Univers ities Primary Author: Gloria J. McNeal, PhD, APRN, BC School: School of Nursing The aim of this study was to examine faculty satisfaction and t he relationships among selected elements of African American women nurse faculty productivity at two types of insti tutions: predominantly white (PWCUs) and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Organizat ional Culture Theory was used as the conceptual framework to provide the basis to explore the extent of product ivity and levels of satisfaction among the study participants. Satisfaction was measured using a six-point Liker t attitudinal scale. Scholarly Productivity was measured as the extent of published/submitted works (authorship ), number and dollar amounts of grant submissions (grantsmanship) and elected/appointed positions held in profess ional organizations (leadership). Consistent with previous research studies of minority faculty in other discipli nes, the current study found that the majority of African American women nurse faculty tended not to hold senior professorial rank, administrative positions, or tenure status. When comparisons were made between HBCU and PWCU faculty, however, a higher percentage of HBCU faculty reported holding deanships or program coordinator positions and, on average, had slightly larger dollar amounts for funded grant awards and held significantly m ore leadership positions in professional nursing organizations. The aggregated data findings of this study did not support a st rong relationship between selected elements of satisfaction with the academic institution's organizational cul ture and the scholarly productivity of African American women nurse faculty teaching at HBCUs and PWCUs. Howev er, when the data were disaggregated by type school, moderately significant differences between HBCU an d PWCU faculty were found, such that along several dimensions of the constructs of organizational culture the levels of dissatisfaction among PWCU faculty significantly skewed the overall data findings. In general, whi le PWCU faculty demonstrated higher levels of authorship, reported larger salaries, and held more tenured pos itions when compared with HBCU faculty, PWCU respondents tended to be significantly less satisfied with the leadership, environment, and socialization processes of their respective collegiate schools of nursing than were their HBCU counterparts. Among HBCU faculty the extent of productivity positively correlated with satisfaction for thr ee of the six dimensions of organizational culture. McNeal, GJ (2003).

The ABNF Journal 14:1, 4-12- 32 -Development of Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Tuberculosis School National TB Center (NTBC) Introduction: Health education research demonstrates that materials targeted to specific populations effectively change health behaviors in those populations. As United States (U.S.) TB rates remain highest in the foreign-born, the need for culturally and linguistically appropriate TB patie nt educational materials becomes more apparent. In response, NJMS NTBC, in 2002-2003, conducted 8 focus groups in 5 geographically diverse regions of the U.S. to gather needs assessment data on preferred content and format fo r new culturally and linguistically appropriate TB patient materials. Research findings guided the development of 6 new TB patient education materials in three languages. New materials were field tested with preferred popu lations and revised according to feedback received. Methods: Standardized focus group methods were used with members of the preferred populations; high-risk English speaking, Filipino, Mexican, and Vietnamese (formative research only) TB patients and non-patients, for both formative research and field testing. Discussion topics i ncluded: perceptions of illness, healing and treatment, TB knowledge, impact of diagnosis, contact investigation, treat ment adherence, latent TB infection (LTBI), mantoux tuberculin skin testing, barriers to health seeking beh avior, and preferred educational materials format. Data from this research guided the development of new culturall y and linguistically appropriate TB patient education materials. Materials were developed according to the principles of health literacy with color photographs. Materials were field tested with preferred populations to asses s comprehension of key concepts. Participants also evaluated layout, including: placement, amount and size of text , appropriateness of language and photographs, as well as the overall visual appeal of materials. Results: Needs assessment data confirmed that cultural beliefs and issue s impact perceptions of TB. This leads to gaps in knowledge about the mechanism of TB, possibly impacting treatment adherence. The following findings were common among foreign-born participants 1) multifactorial t heories of causation and prevention of TB 2) TB infection as inevitable among certain populations 3) confusion between LTBI and TB disease 4) difficulty differentiating between vaccinations and diagnostic tests 5) TB medications causing \"hot\" side effects. This data guided development of 6 TB patient materials (skin testing, TB disease, latent TB infection, contact investigation, adherence, and TB and HIV) in English as well as bilingual Span ish, and Tagalog (Vietnamese deferred until 2006). Field-testing data indicated minimal comprehension of th e difference between TB disease and LTBI, particularly for Spanish-speaking participants. The descriptio n provided in the material was too confusing. The term 'contact investigation' was not readily recognized by TB p atients. Other key concepts tested were adequately understood. The amount of white space, text, and photographs w ere found to be visually appealing, and were said to facilitate ease of reading. Most participants found the lan guage level appropriate. Some of the Tagalog words used were said to be \"too deep\" for the general public. Englis h-speaking participants suggested more photos of African-American male patients. Several photos were not correc tly interpreted to represent the intended behavior. Overall, we received positive feedback on the new patient educa tion materials. Revisions included: clarifying some text, particularly some Tagalog words, and the description of L TBI vs. TB disease, changing the title of the contact investigation material, substituting several photographs, and c hanging the size and placement of selected text. Conclusion: In developing effective education materials, it is essential to utilize a systematic approach that includes formative research and pre-testing with the preferred population. By including the preferred population in the development process, materials will more likely be appropri ate for, and accepted by, the intended audience. 1Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of TB Elimination (DTBE)- 33 -Cardiac Rehabilitation: Barriers To Participation Primary Author: Ariz R. Mehta, M.D. School: New Jersey Medical School Barriers to participation in cardiac rehabilitation include the lack of access to appropriate services, reimbursement issues, the lack of physician referral (particularly of women, older adults, and ethnic minority patients), geographic limitations to accessibility of program sites, and at times, pe rsonal reluctance to alter lifestyle habits. Females are less likely than males, and blacks are less likely than whites to be referred to cardiac rehabilitation programs. Many factors are associated with participation in cardiac rehabilita tion programs, but participation typically is dependent on a referral from a physician. In a study performed in Canada, where cardiac rehabilitation is free, family income was the only socio-demographic variable which was significantly predicative of attending cardiac rehabilitation. Women in cardiac rehabilitation programs surveyed had a greater cardiovascular disease risk factor burden than men, and women were less likely than men to enroll in cardiac r ehabilitation following myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Sources of Stress and Coping Strategies in Three Latino Groups Primary Author: Frances Munet-Vilaro, PhD, RN Co-Authors: Susan Folkman1, Steven E. Gregorich1 School: School of Nursing 1University of California San Francisco Objective: This study examined the perceived sources of stress and coping styles of Mexican immigrants in the US (referred here as Latino immigrants), Mexicans living in Mexico City and Island Puerto Ricans. Design: A descriptive design was used to elicit information of perceived sources of s tressful events from a convenience sample of 1063 subjects. The Spanish version of the Ways of Coping questionnaire was used to examine how participants coped with the stressful events. The d ata were gathered in surveys conducted between 1994 and 1995 as part of a larger study on caregiver burden of Latinos caring for a family member with AIDS. Demographic data was also collected from participants. Data col lection was performed by the first author on site in the three countries. Findings : The most frequently reported sources of stress across the thr ee groups were in the areas of work/finance, family/friends, and health. The groups did differ in the ways t hey coped with the events. The clearest group differences emerged in the ways people coped with health-relate d stressful events with Latino immigrants and Mexicans endorsing cognitive/escape avoidance and accepting res ponsibility more than island Puerto Ricans. Conclusion: Although the Latino groups were similar in their appraisal of sources of stress, there was a clear difference in the ways the groups cope with the events. The re sults of this study demonstrate the need to carefully consider socio-cultural differences among Latino groups when as sessing their sources of perceived stress and coping styles.

Theoretical Framework: Kleinman's (1980) Explanatory Model for Illness and Leininger's (1997) theory of culture care diversity and universality. Methods : Descriptive, correlational design using quantitative and qual itative methods. Two instruments used were the Russian versions of the Talbieh Brief Distress Inventory (T BDI) (Ristner, et al., 1997) and the Attitudes toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help (ATTPS) (Fischer & Turn er, 1970). The TBDI measured self-reported symptoms and intensity of distress experienced by subjects. The ATTPS determined attitudes toward seeking professional help for psych/mental illness. Both instruments ha ve established validity & reliability. Participant- observations for 3.5 months were conducted at 2 sites using fie ld notes and audio taped individual interviews in Russian for at least one hour at the sites or in subjects' home s. Sample : Quantitative sample comprised of 123 elders at least 65 years old, originated from one of the Republics of the FSU, migrated to the US as an adult, read and write in Engl ish or Russian and self-identified as Russian or belonging to other ethnic groups in the FSU. 23 elders who comp leted the quantitative surveys were interviewed. Findings : Overall scores on the TBDI and ATTPS revealed minimal recogni tion and reporting of psychological symptoms and distress as well as reluctance to seek professiona l help. Jewish subjects outscored other groups in both TBDI and ATTPS indicating greater recognition of symptoms and more positive attitudes. Availability of medical insurance, years in the US and experience with mental h ealth services in the US were correlated with and predicted scores on the TBDI and ATTPS. Access to Russian speak ing primary care provider and presence of chronic medical conditions correlated with higher scores on the TBDI. Qualitative findings revealed that Soviet social and historical context influenced the meaning, attitudes , expressions, and coping strategies toward psychological and mental illness. Cultural stigma influenced th e attribution of cause, somatic expression of symptoms, and attitudes towards seeking professional help. Psyc hological illness was unrecognized while mental illness was attributed to lack of inner strength and moral char acter equated with loss of one's soul.- 35 -Experiences with Acculturation: A Comparative Study of Foreign Educated Nurses (FENs) and Their Managers, Educators and School: School of Nursing Purpose : Examined the relationship between demographic and organizatio nal variables, and acculturation of Foreign Educated Nurses (FENs) in the workplace and community b ased on the initial and long term experiences of FENs and their Managers, Educators, Preceptors (MEPs). Conceptu al Framework: Padilla's (1980) acculturation model. Methods : Descriptive correlational design using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The Majority-Minority Relations Survey (MMRS) (Sodowsky & Plake, 1991) was used to me asure the degree of acculturation of FENs to the dominant American culture. Content validity of the MMRS wa s established by a panel of experts and internal consistency reported between C-alpha values of .79-.89. Indivi dual and focus group interviews conducted based on participants' preference using a guide with open-ended question s. Interviews were audio taped and lasted between 45-60 minutes.Sample : Three integrated healthcare systems actively recruiting FENs participated. Quantitative sample consisted of 144 FENs from India (28%), Philippines (65%), and Trinidad a nd Tobago (7%) who took basic nursing education and training in countries outside of the US, employed full-time in one of the hospitals in the 3 healthcare systems, completed totally or partially the employment orientat ion and/or acculturation program(s) in their workplace, and arrived in the US within the last 3 years. Quali tative sample consisted of 40 FENs and 32 MEPs representing the 3 healthcare systems. All FENs completed the quantitative surveys prior to being interviewed. The MEPs had direct experience in working with FENs within the last 3 years in their current position. Findings : Similarities evident in the FENs' experiences with initial tr ansition and lingering difficulty with professional communication. Language familiarity, length of tim e in the US, food preferences, ethnicity, and acculturation classes were significant in the mean scores on th e MMRS. Trinidadian nurses had higher language acculturation while Indian nurses perceived greater prejudice. Length of time in the US and being precepted by someone of the same ethnicity correlated positively with scores on familiarity with social customs of the host culture. Acculturation programs increased language acculturatio n. Social environment at home and at work were predictors of acculturation. Exposure to mixed groups demonstra ted by company, co-worker and food preferences facilitated acculturation. Personal attributes and support from peers, community and organization were significant in enhancing initial and long term acculturation.- 36 -Socioeconomic Disparities in the Evaluation and Treatment Of Musculoskeletal Oncology Patients Primary Author: Francis Patterson, MD Co-Authors: Charles Jordan, Matt Monteleone, Joseph Benevenia, MD, Kathleen S. Beebe School: New Jersey Medical School Background: Socioeconomic factors and their effect on healthcare disparit ies is a topic that has received much attention recently. Little has been done to investigate the eff ects of such factors in the area of musculoskeletal oncology. Our goal was to assess whether patients in a private office received more timely evaluation and treatment than those in a publicly funded clinic and if other factors con tributed to delays in assessment. Materials and Methods : After obtaining IRB approval, socioeconomic status surveys w ere filled out by patients at their first visit to a musculoskeletal oncologist in either our hospital based clinic (n=20) or the attendings private office (n=36). The survey assessed the patients background info rmation (occupation, marital status, living situation, income) as well as means for obtaining usual health care (prima ry car provider-PCP and frequency of visits to same) In addition, the survey assessed length of symptoms and pain scale to time of requesting and obtaining an appointment with a physician and to the time to referral to and appointment with a musculoskeletal oncologist. Surveys were analyzed using two-sample t-test to compare the me ans for the different populations. Results: The average clinic patient waited over 3 times as long (6 mont hs verses 2 years) p=.0003 as the average private patient before seeking medical attention for their cond ition. Patients without a primary care provider waited 10 days longer than those with a primary care provider for an a ppointment to see any doctor ( p=.014). Patients with an annual income < $25,000 rated their pain at an average of 7.10 as compared to those with an annual income of >$25,000 at 4.29 (p= .002). The length of time from imaging studies to referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist was 59 days longer for the clinic based patients verses the pri vate patients ( p= .002) Conclusion : The results of our study indicate that many factors are asso ciated with a delay in assessment for musculoskeletal oncology conditions. Patients of lower income a nd those without primary care providers have longer delays. In addition, patients served by publicly funded clinics experience longer wait times until appointments are given.- 37 -Factors that Influence Colorectal Cancer Screening Practice in the Latino Community Primary Author: Ana Natale Pereira, MD, MPH Co-Authors: PhD; , MD, Mark S. MD MPH School: New Jersey Medical School Context: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common form of cance r and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. CRC screening rates contin ue to remain low among Latinos and little information exists on cultural and linguistic barriers. Objective: To increase knowledge and awareness about CRC, and increase th e rate of screening and early detection among Latinos. Design: A qualitative study using focus groups. Setting: Five communit y-based organizations (CBOs) serving the Latino population of Newark, NJ. Participants: Staff members ( active participants or leaders) of the five CBOs. Inclusion criteria are: Age 18 or over, be a representative of the demographics of the community, and be involved in the community. Intervention: Focus groups were conducted to determine factors that affect CRC screening among Latinos, such as knowledge, level of awareness, barriers to screening, perceived attitudes, and beliefs. Main Outcome Measures: Perceived barriers to CRC screening, and reco mmendations to overcome barriers. Results: Thirty-six staff members participated in the focus groups. The top four barriers to CRC screening were: language, lack of insurance, undocumented status, and little kn owledge about CRC. Other barriers included: low perceived risk, low priority of CRC, fear of CRC, denial, fatal ism, low priority of health care, and no regular source of care. Facilitators to screening included: a desire for infor mation and health services in the community, use of health care providers as source for CRC screening recommendatio n, using multiple sources of health information, and the feasibility of Fecal Occult Blood Testing. Implementati on strategies included: partnering with CBOs for outreach, incorporating CRC screening into other community prog rams, offering convenient testing, tailoring the education and information provided. Conclusion : Educational programs aimed at increasing CRC awareness and sc reening, could only be successful if the specific barriers and perceived health beliefs of the Latin o community are addressed.- 38 -Patient and Spouse Preferences for Dialysis Continuation: Does Author: Medicine Introduction: Medical technology advancements in life-sustainin g medical treatment are changing the way we face the end of life. Particularly, there is an increase in the nee d for medical treatment decisions when a patient's cognitive ability is compromised. In many cases, a health care proxy is designated to make medical treatment decisions that reflect the wishes of the patient. The OPTIONS s tudy examines patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and their spouses. ESRD is an incurable, life-t hreatening disease marked by permanent cessation of kidney function. Hemodialysis treatment is prescribed to sus tain the life of an ESRD patient. Foregoing hemodialysis treatment means that the patient will die within d ays. Surrogate decision-making is especially relevant in this population, where severe co-morbid conditions frequently challenge the decision to maintain a demanding treatment regimen. Also, such conditions often impai r decision-making capacity of the patient as health changes. This study examines the factors that predict the pati ent's and spouse's wishes for continuing hemodialysis treatments. Methods: Nephrology patients diagnosed with ESRD and being tre ated with hemodialysis were recruited for this study. Recruitment methods included advertisements in newspape rs, referral from staff at dialysis centers, and mailings to those receiving financial assistance for dialysis t reatment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Couples were eligible for inclusion in the study if p atients: 1) had end-stage renal disease; 2) were on hemodialysis for at least 6 months; 3) were at least 55 years o ld; and 4) were married for at last 5 years. Recruitment efforts yielded a total of 315 couples. Patients an d spouses were interviewed within a mean of 5 days of one another. In order to maintain confidentiality, patients and spouses in each couple were interviewed by different interviewers. In order to assess patient preferences and spouses' substituted judgment for continuation of dialysis, respondents were presented with a series of hypotheti cal situation as asked about the likelihood of the patient continuing on dialysis given each condition. They incl uded those in which the patient developed mild, moderate and sever stroke, mild, moderate and severe dementia, permanent coma and terminal illness, both with and without pain. For these analyses, 34 Caucasian and 34 Afric an American patients were matched on demographic variables (sex, age, education and income) to elimi nate the possibility that these demographic variables explained differences in racial categories.Results: Analyses suggest that African American and Caucasian patients do not differ in their preferences for continuing dialysis. However, there is a difference in response s from Caucasian and African American spouses' regarding dialysis continuation. Caucasian spouses were more li kely to indicate that they would terminate dialysis than were African-American spouses. Furthermore, African Americ an spouses statistically report less death anxiety, less fear of painful death, less caregiver burden, gre ater religious activity and greater valuation of life than Caucasian spouses. Caucasian patients were more likely to have signed a living will. Conclusion: Results suggest that spouses' substituted judgment for dialysis continuation can be predicted by caregiver burden, race, and patient preference for dialysis con tinuation.

Janal School: New Jersey Dental School Objectives: To assess oral health needs of children ages 2-5, and to rela te those needs to the level of access to oral health care as reported by parents. Methods: C aregivers of children enrolled in a NE urban Head Start program completed consent forms and responded to a 21- item survey regarding oral hygiene practices and sociodemographic information. Their children received an oral exam where dental experiences (dets) data were collected. Results: Subjects were 136 Head Start preschoolers and their parents ( 45.6% female; 45.7% Black, 44.2% Latino). Despite the Head Start program requirement for a dental exam, 4 0% of the children had not received one at the time of enrollment in the program. Dental experience (defs) for the 80 children who had an exam prior to enrollment was 4.0, statistically similar to the defs of 3.8 in those who had not gotten the required examination. Both of these groups showed more pathology than a demographically similar gro up examined in NHANES III, where the mean defs was 1.4 (p< .05). Children whose parents reported Medicai d coverage were found to have more untreated decay than others (68.2 vs. 39.8%, p= .01), although children w ith Medicaid were not more likely to need an exam than others (27.3 vs. 43.0%, p= .17), and defs was also similar in the two groups (M (SD) = 5.4(8.1) vs. 3.8(7.4), p= .35). While 60% of the children had received the required oral exam, the majority of them had not received follow- up treatment for caries. Conclusion: Exam status for Head Start children did not differ between tho se who had had an required exam and those that did not have the exam. Regardless of group, the stu dy sample had higher unmet needs than that reported in NHANES. Children with Medicaid had significantly greater def s than children who did not have Medicaid.- 40 -Oral Health Promotion among Older Persons and Their Caregivers Primary Author: Rebecca Reed, DMD Co-Authors: H. Broder, G. Jenkins, E. Spivack, M. Janal, R. Chaviano-Moran School: New Jersey Dental School Objectives: To assess oral health status and oral health-related quality o f life (OHRQOL) of residents in an extended care facility, and to assess caregivers' oral health a ttitudes and knowledge. Methods: Participants included 137 residents (58.1% female, mean age w as 67.7 yr (range 32- 94), 91.0% black), and 22 caregivers (primarily nurses, LPNs). Residents received an oral exam and completed the OHIP-14, an OHRQOL questionnaire. Dental care was offered to residents with unmet dental needs. Caregivers completed an oral health knowledge (OHK) questionnaire before and after the on-site geriatric oral health service program (four presentations on geriatric oral health issues and oral hygiene demonstration.) Results: Oral exams showed that 58% of the residents had extensive and varied unmet oral health needs. Follow-up care was provided for approximately 50% of those with unmet nee ds. On the OHIP-14, the mean severity was 9.2 (sd=12.0), extent (number of items rated as 'fairly often' or ' often') was 1.2 (sd=2.6), and prevalence (participants rating at least one item at least 'fairly often') was 37.8%. Mo st prevalent (>25%) items were negative impact about 'oral pain', 'appearance' and 'self-consciousness'. These score s indicate significantly lower OHQOL (p<.05) in this group than has been reported for normative samples of this age [Slade (2003)]. Regarding OHK, caregivers' knowledge improved following instruction, from 65% correct on t he pretest to 90% correct on the post-test (p<.01). Exit interview data revealed that physical limitations, fear of getting bitten, and time constraints were barriers to providing oral hygiene to the residents. Conclusion: Exam data showed extensive levels of unmet dental needs among the majority of subjects, and significant negative impact on their OHRQOL. Although caregiver s improved their oral health knowledge following the geriatric service program, specific barriers repo rtedly precluded behavior changes in providing oral hygiene to the residents.

Reichman, MD, MPH School: New Jersey Medical School The New Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center (NTB C) was established as a joint venture between the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jers ey Medical School (NJMS) and the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS). Both of the se agencies, who at the time had an almost 20 year history of close collaboration in innovative aspects of TB control for the racial and ethnically diverse population of Newark and New Jersey, had recognized the need fo r a model TB training, care and clinical studies center. The shared vision of the NJMS and the NJDHSS for the m odel TB Center of Excellence was not only to bring state-of-the-art medical care and social services to the TB patients served under its agencies, but to create new and cost-effective approaches to TB prevention and control. Su ch an approach would be based upon a consumer- services approach, the hallmark of which is accountability of s taff at all levels for all aspects of tuberculosis service and care. NTBC is one of the seven original CDC Clinical Trial s Consortium sites (now Tuberculosis Trials Consortium, TBTC) of 1993 contracted to perform studies of TB t reatment and prevention and is one of the few contract sites that is both a health department site and an aca demic center. NTBC is also a charter member of the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium. The underlying mission of the Center is to provide exemplary pa tient care for our clients which leads itself to exemplary clinical, epidemiologic and behavioral studies should the client wish to avail him/herself of them and training of other professionals based on our experiences and re sults. The Center has dozens of protocols for TB drug treatment, diagnostic tests and epidemiology, several of w hich will be described.- 42 -The Use of Epidemiologic Data in Developing Capacity and Needs Assessments in Comprehensive Cancer Control Efforts Primary Authors: Daniel M. Rosenblum, PhD Co-Authors: Margaret L. Knight, RN, M Ed3, Susan L. Collini, MPH1, Jung Y. Kim, MPH1, Judith B. Klotz, DrPH2, David L. Hom, MS1, Loretta L. Morales, MPH1, Sharon L. Smith, MPH3, Marcia M. Sass, ScD2, Stanley H. Weiss, MD, FACP 1,2 School:1 New Jersey Medical School 2 School of Public Health Introduction : As part of implementing the New Jersey Comprehensive Cancer C ontrol Plan in 2003-2005, cancer resource capacity and needs were assessed under our direction i n each county by health planners from community- level organizations. Method : These assessments included: (1) standardized evaluations of p opulation demographics; (2) surveys of health care providers and facilities and of community and faith -based organizations that provide cancer screening, education, treatment, palliation and support services; and (3) analysis of cancer incidence and mortality rates and distribution of disease stage at diagnosis, along with rough es timates of prevalence. Efforts were made to identify health disparities within the county and as compared to the sta te as a whole. Based on these data, county and state priorities were proposed for implementation by countywide cance r coalitions developed with this assessment. Analyses of the aforementioned county-level cancer epidemiologi c data were needed for the comprehensive assessments. The types and sources of data used will be reviewe d and pitfalls examined. Problems related to using published data that had been calculated on the basis of standar dized populations will be discussed. Approaches to analyzing incidence and mortality rates and staging data will a lso be described. Results : Many health planners were recruited based on knowledge of and interest in their communities. However, lack of familiarity with the use and interpretation of epidemio logic data was common. Several types of errors were identified by us. Suggestions for avoiding these in future pla nning efforts will be discussed. Conclusion : Levels of public support and funding, as well as policy decis ions, influence the ability to improve cancer outcomes. The critical components of this process are ac curate, up-to-date assessment of community resources and identification of the community's specific cancer needs. Appropriate use and interpretation of epidemiologic data are critical to successful implementation at state and local levels. 3NJ Department of Health and Senior Services, Office of Cancer C ontrol and Prevention- 43 -Diabetic Complications in African-Americans with Type I Diabetes: The New Jersey 725 Primary Author: Monique Roy, MD School: New Jersey Medical School The New Jersey 725 is an ongoing NIH-supported study of 725 African-Americans wit h type 1 diabetes, diagnosed and treated with insulin before 30 years of age. This is the la rgest cohort to date of African-Americans with diabetes. Baseline examinations of patients enrolled in this st udy were carried out between 1993 and 1997. The 6- year follow-up study is ongoing. Data presented today pertain t o the baseline examination and encompass: (1) frequency and severity of visual impairment and diabetic retino pathy, (2) eye care statistics, and (3) diabetic renal disease. When the study was initiated in 1993, little was known about di abetic retinopathy in this population except that non-white women were three times more likely to be blind from d iabetes that non-white men, or white men or women. The purpose of the study was to determine the frequency and severity of visual impairment, of diabetic retinopathy, and factors associated with severity of retinopath y in African-Americans with type 1 diabetes. Patients were identified from New Jersey Hospital Discharge dat a. Of the 13,615 medical charts reviewed from 31 NJ hospitals within a 20-mile radius from the Medical school, 8 75 patients were found to be eligible, and 725 participated.Findings are reported pertaining to: Visual Impairment, Diabeti c Retinopathy, Risk Factors for Diabetic Retinopathy, Eye Care, and Diabetic Renal Disease. Conclusions: In African-Americans with type 1 diabetes: * Visual impairment is more common in women than in men and tha n in whites with type 1 diabetes * Older women are at a higher risk of vision threatening retino pathy than any other group. * Longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, and syste mic hypertension are risk factors for retinopathy. * Fewer than 50% receive an annual dilated eye examination as c urrently recommended. * Proteinuria is very common, particularly in men, and appears to precede severe retinopathy.- 44 -The New Jersey Community Health Worker Institute (NJCHWI) Primary Author: Carl H. Rush, MRP School: School of Osteopathic Medicine A project of New Jersey Area Health Education Centers (AHEC), a n affiliate program of UMDNJ-SOM, in partnership with Camden AHEC, Garden AHEC and Shore AHEC, with initial funding from HRSA. Community Health Workers (CHWs) serve as the \"bridge\" connectin g the community to healthcare and human services. They are effective because they know and are trusted by the community they serve. They ensure that people in underserved communities get the services they need; t hey provide on-going support for behavior changes critical to improved health outcomes; they are effective at red ucing the costs of chronic disease management, increasing immunization rates and improving birth outcomes in m inority populations. However, the CHW occupation is neither standardized nor widely recognized; there is no functioning job market, no standards of training and no common career advancement opportunities. NJCHW I is one of only three statewide initiatives of its kind, whose purpose is to lead in: creating statewide netwo rks of CHWs and their employers; developing a statewide workforce plan for CHWs; generating education and tra ining opportunities, and considering credentialing options. NJCHWI has also proposed, with the help of UMDNJ and t he New Jersey Council of Teaching Hospitals, to make CHWs a key resource in improving the cultural competenc e of medical and other health professions students and medical residents, exposing students and medical r esidents to (a) curriculum content on how to supervise and work effectively with CHWs, and (b) structured cl inical experiences working alongside CHWs. HRSA support is expected for these activities, and for designin g pilot health care initiatives involving CHWs as part of interdisciplinary teams. Community Health Worker National Workforce Study (CHW-NWS) Primary Author: Carl H. Rush, MRP School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Two-year contract from HRSA Bureau of Health Professions, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to the Regional Center for Health Workforce Studies at t he University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. NJCHWI Director Carl H. Rush is a Co-Investigator on this Study, under a subcontract to Camden AHEC. The purpose of the Study is to draw an accurate profile of the community health worker (CHW) workforce, including quantitative and qualitative aspects of CHW employmen t and the potential job market. The study is also examining related issues, such as training and credentialing st andards, the availability of funding streams for education and compensation as well as current state/federal pol icy trends and options. The final report will provide a national profile and detailed assessments of the CHW workforc e in eight states. Key Research Modules: estimates of the numbers CHWs from current Census and Labor Dep artment Occupation data; a survey of known and potential CHW employers by the Center for Sustainable Healt h Outreach (CSHO) at the University of Southern Mississippi using an instrument developed by CHSO and partially modified in collaboration with RCHWS; in- depth studies of selected states to provide more detailed infor mation on CHW issues by review of extant data and facilitated \"focus workshops.\" Other Research Partners include the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission; Community Voices (CV), National Center for Primary Care, Atlant a; and the CHW National Education Collaborative, a national initiative by 20 college-supported programs on \"best practices\" in competency-based education, funded Follow-Up Tests (RAFTs) After Colonoscopy Primary Author: Robert J. Richards, MD, MS Co-Author: Stephen Crystal, PhD1 School: New Jersey Medical School, Newark 1Rutgers University-Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research Background : The number of repeat and follow - up tests (RAFTs) occurring after colonoscopy is a short term outcome, which has not been previously examined in the literatu re. RAFTs add cost, discomfort and inconvenience to colonoscopy; therefore it is important to identify their fre quency and factors associated with their use. Methods : We identified elderly Medicare recipients who had colonoscopy performed in 1999 from the 5% Medicare administrative files (N = 69,282). We determined the n umber of RAFTs (repeat colonoscopy, barium enema, flexible sigmoidoscopy) occurring the year of ini tial colonoscopy. Results : 8.3% of the study sample required at least one RAFT during th e year. Using multivariable analysis we found that RAFTs varied significantly with age, race, sex, inco me, comorbidity, provider type and place of service. RAFT were 22% higher in African-Americans compared to whites. G astroenterologists used 20 - 35% fewer RAFTs than the other provider types examined. Conclusion : RAFTs are common, occurring in 8.3% of the Medicare populatio n. Gastroenterologists utilized fewer RAFTs than other provider types. RAFTs were more likely to occu r in African-Americans compared to whites. Racial Differences in the Use of Colonoscopy, Sigmoidoscopy and Barium Enema in Medicare Beneficiaries Primary Author: Robert J. Richards, MD, MS Co-Authors: Dean M. Reker, PhD 1 School: New Jersey Medical School Colorectal cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage in blacks . We wanted to know if racial differences existed in the use of tests for detection of colorectal cancer. A 5% rando m sample was obtained of all Medicare beneficiaries with Part B coverage, aged 65 years and older, classified as wh ite or black race. The numbers of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema were determined from th e Physician/Supplier file. Blacks were 18% less likely to receive colonoscopy and 39% less likely to receive fl exible sigmoidoscopy after controlling for age, sex, income and access to care in a multivariable logistic regressio n model. Barium enema was not significantly different between the races. Black men had 25% lower use of col onoscopy and 50% decreased use of flexible sigmoidoscopy. Blacks receive less colonoscopy and flexible sig moidoscopy than whites. Black men are particularly vulnerable to the under use of these tests. 1 Veterans Affairs Medical Center; Department of Health Services Research and University of Kansas Medical Center; Center for Aging; Kansas City, KS- 46 -Colorectal Cancer Screening in Hispanics: Effect of Sociodemographics and Access to Care Primary Author: Robert J. Richards, MD, MS Co-Authors: Tsu-Hon Wang School: New Jersey Medical School Purpose : Hispanics (H) undergo colorectal cancer (CRC) screening less frequently than non-Hispanic white and black persons. Also, H have less access to medical care and low er socioeconomic status when compared to whites. It is unknown whether sociodemographic and access to care varia bles are primarily responsible for the lower CRC screening rates seen in H. Our purpose was to determine if lowe r screening rates for CRC in H persisted after controlling for sociodemographic and access to care variables. Methods : The study was based on data collected through the 1999 Behavi oral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is a national randomized telephone survey. Inclu ded for study were respondents with age \u00b3 55 or \u00a3 85 years old whose race was classified as Hispanic (H), White n onHispanic (W) or Black nonHispanic (B). Respondents were categorized as screened if a home fecal occult blood test was done within the past 1 year or a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy within 5 years, i.e. within standard recommended time intervals. Independent variables considered were: age, sex, income level, tobacco use, alcohol c onsumption, marital status, and health insurance coverage. We excluded respondents having an unknown CRC screeni ng status, those refusing to answer questions pertaining to the study variables or those respondents having m issing data in any of the variables analyzed. This left 44,700 subjects. For the data analysis, a logistic regression m odel was performed using sampling weights in SAS (version 8.2). The odds ratio (OR) of being screened was calcul ated for H (using W as the referent group) before and after adjustment for all covariables in the model. Wald 95% confidence intervals are also given. Results : There were: 2,711 H: 39,443 W: and 2,616 B included in the st udy. 62% of the sample were women. The mean age of those screened was 67.8 years vs. 66.6 years for th ose not screened (t-test; p < 0.0001). Overall, 45.1% of the total sample had CRC screening performed within the reco mmended interval. Screening in H (34%) occurred less often than screening in W (46%) and B (45%), yielding an O R of 0.59 (95% C.I. 0.58-0.59). The OR after adjusting for all covariables in the model was 0.76 (95% C.I. 0 .75-0.76). Conclusion : After controlling for sociodemographic and access to care var iables, Hispanics remain 24% less likely than whites to undergo CRC screening. These results imply that unmeasured variables (possibly culture-specific) may play a significant role in the screening behavior of Hispan ics. Further research is needed in this area.- 47 -Need for Oral Health Education and Outreach Projects for Better Utilization of Oral Health Care Services in Urban and Underprivileged Communities Primary Author: Asha Samant, DMD, MDS Co-Authors: Joel Martin, DDS, MS, Robert Flinton, DDS, MS School: New Jersey Dental School Background: Utilization of and access to oral health care services are vari able in communities. Socio-economic disadvantage and household factors are well documented to influ ence the decision to seek oral as well as general health care. In addition, self perceived status of oral health, psycho-social and behavioral attributes of individuals and physical discomfort might be equally important determinants for seeking oral health care services Purpose: To determine the impact of physical discomfort, oral health be havior and knowledge of oral health status on the utilization of oral health care services by the urban co mmunity attending our New Jersey Dental School clinic facility. Methods: The study involved a review and analysis of dental records of 241 adult subjects (122 women and 119 men) with a mean age of 39 + 17 years attending New Jersey Dent al School. The study was approved by the IRB. The records were selected by random sequence. Behavioral attrib utes analyzed included the esthetic needs, preventive cleaning of teeth at dental office and frequency of visits to dentists. One hundred one subjects completed questionnaire incorporating standard Locker and Slade tool to a ssess psychological discomfort. Results : Acute dental conditions as the cause of first visit to dentis t was still an important reason to seek oral health care (men 40%, women (21%). Behavioral attribute like esthetics and preventive dental care were more common motivating factors in women. Women also had prior repeat oral h ealth care visits (92%) than men (48%). Psychological discomfort and worry was experienced by an apprec iable number of patients (52%). Conclusion : 1. With the exception of highly motivated and esthetically co nscious subject's acute dental conditions was an important presentation for seeking oral health care in u rban facility. 2. Psychological discomfort and worry experienced by an appreciable number of patients indicative of poor understanding of oral health requires oral health education. 3. These findings strongly support the need f or oral health education and outreach projects for better utilization of oral health care services in urban and un der privileged areas.- 48 -Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection in African Ame ricans: Need for Re-Assessment of Current Practice Guideline Primary Author: Arun Samanta, MD School: New Jersey Medical School Introduction : Chronic hepatitis C viral infection in African American patie nts presents challenging issues in its epidemiology, severity of hepatic injury and fibrosis, incidenc e of hepatocellular carcinoma and response to current treatment. The disease is 2 to 3 times more prevalent in Africa n Americans than Caucasians and more than 90% have the treatment refractory genotype 1 as compared to 70 % ge notype I in Caucasians. There is also an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in African American patie nts with chronic hepatitis C. On the other hand studies suggest that degree of hepatic fibrosis and prevalence of cirrhosis in African Americans with hepatitis C infection may be less. Methods : African Americans respond poorly to the current treatment wit h interferon plus ribavirin. Poor response to hepatitis C treatment in these patients is seen even when co rrected for genotype and severity of the disease. Despite need to understand these complexities of hepatitis C in African Americans only about 5% of the patients enrolled in the pivotal therapeutic trials have been African Am ericans. Currently ongoing trials are addressing some of these issues. One of such trials by Muir and associates publ ished last year where, 100 African American patients were compared with 100 Caucasians patients with similar distrib ution of genotype 1 infection and treated for 48 weeks with PEG interferon alfa 2b + ribavirin reveled only 19% sustained viral response as compared to 42 % in Caucasians. Results : There is a suggestion that weight-based dosing of ribavirin u p to 1400 mg a day might improve the treatment response in African American patients. Another innova tive approach based on mathematical modeling has suggested duration of treatment beyond conventional 48 week s in African American patients with genotype1 infection using combination of interferon and ribavirin. As no new antiviral agent is on the horizon such a treatment approach deserves clinical trials.Conclusion : Progress has been made in identifying newer ribavirin analogs and their safety and efficacy is under evaluation. However, agents like protease and polymerase inhibi tors, immune modulators, stellate cell modifiers, antifibrotic agents and interferon response genes are still in early stages.- 49 -House Calls for Seniors: Establishing Community-Based Geriatric Primary Author: Keerti Sharma, MD Co-Authors: Debbie-Salas Lopez, MD, Carmen McLaughlin, BS School: New Jersey Medical School Background : The elderly population typically has low rates of preventive screening measures (CMS, HEDIS, 2001); these rates are even lower among low-income, minority el derly. Most seniors report difficulty in keeping appointments because of lack of transportation, unavailability of someone to accompany them to appointments, difficulty navigating the hospital, limited financial resources , and fear of institutionalization. The elderly population in Newark faces multiple barriers to accessing quality health c are, including underlying co-morbidities, immobility, frailty, lack of family support, and social issues. Objective : The House Calls for Seniors program is a community-based geriatrics service of the Divisio n of Academic Medicine, Geriatrics, and Community Programs, working in partnership with community-based organizations in order to provide healthcare to senior citizens residing in Section 8 Senior Housing in the greater Newark Area.Methods : The program utilizes an interdisciplinary home healthcare tea m, consisting of a Geriatrician, Geriatric Nurse Practitioner, and a Social Worker. The interdisciplinary team emphasizes health maintenance and chronic disease management of seniors, while maximizing their independe nce. The House Calls for Seniors program currently operates in two New Community Corporation (NCC) build ings in Newark, and \"house calls\" are being made in the Ironbound section of Newark, in collaboration with the Ironbound Community Corporation (ICC). Results : Baseline data from patients of the House Calls for Seniors pr ogram indicate that less than 19% of patients had a mammogram in the last two years, 50% had not been screene d for colorectal cancer, 30% had never received a pneumococcal vaccine. Current results (pending) show a signi ficant increase in the rates for these preventive screening measures since the program was implemented in 2003.Conclusion : By providing comprehensive services at their site of residenc e, the House Calls for Seniors program removes barriers to access, and patients feel safer in their fa miliar surroundings. The program is a return to what was once thought to be a lost practice, in which physicians tra veled throughout the community with a black bag. The House Calls for Seniors program is not only timely, but als o necessary as the elderly underserved population in the Greater Newark Area experience significant barriers in acce ssing healthcare. Such a collaborative initiative between community-based organizations and an academic health ce nter could serve as a practice model with applications beyond the borders of the greater Newark area.- 50 -Perspectives on Cancer Screening Among Internal Medicine Reside nts and Latino Community Members: A Work in Progress Primary Author: Jonnie Marks, PhD, and Maria Soto-Greene, MD School: New Jersey Medical School 1 Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ Background : Latinos have lower rates of cancer screening, partially due t o cultural beliefs that conflict with those of the medical profession (NCHS, 1998). While there is growing literature on cultural competency, few studies have systematically investigated effective strategies for train ing physicians (Brach and Fraser, 2000). Methods : Focus groups were conducted in phase one of this study (total of 4 phases), to assess cultural values, beliefs, and knowledge regarding cancer and cancer screening. T hirty-one Latino community members and 9 NJMS internal medicine residents participated in the focus groups. Results : Among Latino community members, general thoughts on cancer in clude: that early detection and screening are important; cancer is the same, just in different places, and risk factors include certain foods, alcohol, family history, microwaves and cell phones. Reported barriers to screening include: fear, cost or insurance problems, communication barriers with physicians, and distrust of physicians. Recommendations include: having more commercials targeted towards Latinos, treating the whole p erson, and conducting free physical exams to the Latino community annually. General thoughts on the topic among medical residents include: that insurance is not a problem in Newark because of Charity Care, and acculturated fam ilies are more likely to get screened. Perceived screening barriers include: fear that cancer means death, langu age barriers, screening requires too much time off from work, and the concept of machismo. Recommendations include : more health education materials in Spanish, more publicity on cancer issues, resident training in cultural issues, and implementing a more effective phone translation system. Conclusion : While this project is a work in progress, the information gat hered will serve as a framework to develop and implement a cultural competency cancer education program fo r medical residents that meets the community's needs and addresses attitudes and beliefs among the residents. We anticipate that cultural competency training will help improve patient and physician satisfaction, health care ac cess and, moreover, patient outcomes.- 51 -Beliefs and Attitudes on Cancer Screening: Perspectives from In ternal Medicine Residents and Members From The Latino Community Primary Author: Debbie Salas-Lopez, MD Co-Authors: Ana Natale-Pereira MD, Vincent J MD, Kolassa PhD1, Jonnie Marks PhD, Maria Soto-Greene, MD School: New Jersey Medical School 1Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ Context: Latino patients are likely to refuse cancer-screening procedur es due to differences in beliefs with the medical profession. Access, knowledge, behavior, and lack of cu lturally appropriate services are limiting factors in cancer screening. Objective: To demonstrate that a cultural competency education program fo r internal medicine residents will: increase their Latino patients' cancer screening rates, improve satisfaction with the patient-physician encounter; improve residents' attitudes and knowledge of cancer beliefs an d barriers among Latinos. Design: Qualitative Study Setting : A Latino Community Based Organization in Newark, and the Inte rnal Medicine residency program. Participants : Twenty-six community members and 9 internal medicine resident s. Intervention: As formative research to develop the cancer education program , three focus groups were conducted: two with community members, and one with medical residents. Main Outcome Measures : Assess how beliefs and attitudes towards cancer impact on scr eening behavior, and health care delivery. Results: Among community members general thoughts include: cancer is more common in women; earl y detection and screening are important; cancer is the same just in different places; and risk factors include foods, alcohol, family history, microwaves and cell phones. Barriers t o screening are: fear, lack of insurance, communication barriers with and distrust of physicians. Recomme ndations include: health information targeting Latinos, treating the whole person, and conducting free physica ls to the Latino community annually. Among medical residents general thoughts include: insurance is not a problem because o f Charity Care; and acculturated families more likely to get screened. Perceived barriers includ e: fear, language, time off from work, and machismo. Recommendations include: health literacy education in Spanish, publicity on cancer issues, and resident training in cultural competency. Conclusion: It is anticipated that this cancer education program for cultu ral competency training of medical residents will improve patient and physician satisfaction, heal th care access and patient outcomes. This is a work in progress. 1Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ- 52 -Addressing Language Barriers for Minority Patients with Limited English Proficiency Primary Author: Debbie Salas-Lopez, MD Co-Authors: Maria Soto-Greene, MD, Ruth Enid Zambrana PhD, Alex Stagnaro-Gr een MD, Carmen McLaughlin BS, Vincent Barba MD, Ana Natale-Pereira MD, Loretta Morales MPH, David Hom MS School: New Jersey Medical School Although interpreter programs exist in parts of the country, th e majority of volunteer medical interpreters have not completed a formal training program. The patient-physician inte raction is negatively impacted by inaccurate medical interpretation originating from erroneous paraphrasing, lack of linguistic equivalency and bias from the interpreter's own beliefs, views, or emotions. This study aims to assess the efficacy of a newly developed medical interpreter training program in improving the quality of knowle dge and skills of interpreters. Thirty-one hospital employees were recruited to the medical interpreter training pr ogram. Pre and post examinations were administered to study participants, to assess variations in their level of c ultural competency and knowledge of medical interpretation. Twelve interpreters were randomly chosen to com plete an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) before and after the training to determine clinical skil ls acquisition in medical interpretation. Significant improvements were seen in interpreter written examinations (p<. 001). Over 40% of the group had a minimum 10% improvement in scores from pre to post, with 20% of the interpr eters having at least a 25% improvement. The twelve interpreters tested using the OSCE examination showed si gnificant improvements. In conclusion, the curriculum was effective in enhancing the skills of the untrain ed medical interpreters. Antecedents to Effective Treatment of Hypertension in Hispanic Populations Primary Author: Maria L. Soto-Greene, MD Co-Authors: Jorge Sanchez, MD, Debbie Salas-Lopez, MD, Robert Like1, MD, MS. School: New Jersey Medical School 1Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Hypertension is a common medical disorder affecting >50 million people. It is a primary modifiable risk factor to cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of death in black an d Hispanic groups. This article focuses on patient- specific and physician-specific barriers that contribute to und er diagnosis, under treatment, access issues, and poor adherence to therapy. Two cross-cultural interviewing framework s, ETHNIC and ADHERE, are discussed as approaches that complement the traditional clinical assessment and treatment of hypertension in Hispanics. (Clinical Cornerstone. 2004; 6[3]:30- 38) Copyright \u00a9 2004 Exce rpta D.O. School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Physicians must work in concert with other health care professi onals to address the complex needs of an increasingly diverse and aging population. Medical graduates sh ould be knowledgeable about the roles and skills of other health care professionals, and this should be based on an understanding and respect for the professionals in these fields to have effective impact on the health care of the ir patients. Effective collaborative health care delivery also requires expertise in communication, cultural competency, interpersonal skills, negotiation, team building, joint decision-making, and problem solving. A model of interdis ciplinary training on the predoctoral level will be described and the student outcomes will be presented. This was made possible through a HRSA Academic Administrative Units Grant. An Evaluation of the Concordance of Selected Self-Reported Prov ider Recommendations for the Care of Patients With Diabetes With the Recommendations of the American Diabetes Associations Evidence Based Guidelines Using a National Survey Primary Author: Leslie-Faith Morrit Taub, DNSC, RN School: School of Nursing Purpose : It is projected that the prevalence rate of diabetes will inc rease to 29 million people by 2050 if present trends continue. Modifiable risk factors for prevention and tr eatment of diabetes include diet, exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol cessation for those with excessive intake, i nfluenza and pneumonia vaccinations, and foot and eye care. Understanding the predictors of provider advice will allow us to target populations that are less likely to receive this care. Methods: The National Health Interview Survey, 2001 was used in a secon dary data analysis in order to assess how closely providers were now approaching the recommendations of the eight processes-of-care advised by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Descriptive statistics, Ch i-square, and logistic regression analyses were conducted.Results : Hispanics and African Americans were significantly less likel y to be advised get pneumonia or influenza vaccines or to see or speak to an eye doctor. Those on no medic ation for their diabetes were significantly less likely to receive diet advice, pneumonia or influenza vaccines, and se e or speak to a foot or eye doctor however they were significantly more likely to receive alcohol cessation counseli ng. Those on pills for their diabetes were significantly less likely to receive pneumonia or influenza vaccines or see o r speak to with a foot doctor however they were more likely to receive exercise advise. Those ages 65 and over were significantly less likely to receive diet, exercise, and smoking cessation advice, however they were significantly more likely to receive influenza and pneumonia vaccines.Conclusion and Implications : Medication regimen, age, and minority status are factors that are significantly related to the provision of the eight processes-of-care. Unders tanding how these factors relate to provider advice will allow us to target these subgroups who are not getting opt imal diabetes care and providers who need to be made aware of this.- 54 -Identification of Cancer Priorities in Essex County: Results fr om a Cancer Capacity & Needs Assessment (C/NA) Performed as part of a Statewide Initiative of the New Jersey Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan Primary Author: Azadeh Tasslimi, BA Co-Authors: Punam J.

Count y-level epidemiologic data and key demographic indicators from Census 2000, such as poverty, unemployment, and limited English proficiency, were examined to understand potential barriers to healthcare access. Standardized methods revealed that Essex has the highest mortal ity rates for cervical, oral (in males), and prostate cancers among all counties in New Jersey for which data were re ported. Furthermore, the incidence of prostate cancer in Essex County is also highest among all counties in Ne w Jersey. The incidence and mortality rates for these cancers in Essex all exceed state rates by over 10%: Est. Prevalence Incidence/100,000 Mortality/100,000 Cervical 1,120 15.7 * 5.0 * Oral, male 379 17.6 * 5.6 * Prostate 5,089 227.4 39.6 * Racial cancer disparities: *==>Blacks >2-fold higher than white s. Historically, oral and prostate cancers had not been widely rec ognized as priorities for our county. Cervical cancer screening and treatment has been and will remain a priority. The Essex County Cancer Coalition was formed as a partnership o f diverse stakeholders to prioritize and implement recommendations. The Coalition plans to emphasize cer vical, oral and prostate cancers. Proposed activities: create a provider network of cancer resources (iden tified from the C/NA) which offer free/reduced-cost cancer screenings and link it to residents in need; partner wit h faith-based and community organizations to provide on-site cancer education and screenings; and promote increased awareness. In Essex County, the C/NA is the empirical basis for prioritizing cancer control efforts. 1 Hoboken Family Planning- 55 -Colorectal Cancer Screening in Primary Care Settings: A ective MD , MPH; Ping-Hsin Chen, PhD. School: New Jersey Medical School 1 School of Public Health Objective: To assess the rates of CRC screening at two primary care pract ices in an urban setting. We hypothesize that the proportion of patients who are current with CRC screen ing will be lower in our study population than the national 2001 average (FOBT within 12 month - 23.5%, lower endo scopy within 5 years - 38.7%, lower endoscopy within 10 years - 43.4%). Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed at the NJ Family Prac tice Center and the University Family Practice Center at St. James both located in Newark. 264 patien ts over the age of 50 were randomly selected from the billing system. Exclusion criteria included: patients under the age of 50, only one visit to the practice, and patients with a history of CRC. Charts were reviewed for demog raphic information, CRC screening, other screening, CRC risk factors, and chronic conditions. Primary ou tcome measured was the proportion of patients who were current with CRC screening. Patients were considered curr ent with CRC screening if any of the following was documented on the chart: FOBT annually, flexible Sigmoidos copy within 5 years, double contrast barium enema within 5-10 years, or colonoscopy within 10 years.Results: Analytical sample included 218 charts. Mean age of patients wa s 58 (STD = 6.8), mean number of visits to the practice in the last 12 months was 4 (SD = 2.8), mean he ight was 66 inches (SD = 3.8), and mean weight was 191 lbs (SD = 48.6). Demographic characteristics: 64.2% female , 76.0% married, s rates than screening cholester ol - 66.4%, mammography - 64.5%, Pap smear 39.0%, and prostate specific antigen - 56. 3%. Conclusion: In this study, we found, as hypothesized, that the proportion of patients who are current with CRC screening in our study population was lower than the national a verage. This may be due to racial and societal differences, however further studies should be done to determin e why this is the case. Intervention methods such as physician and patient education on the importance of CRC screen ing may be the key to increasing screening rates.- 56 -Estimates of Colorectal Cancer Screening Among Hispanics in the US: Current National Data Likely Overestimates the True Rates Primary Author: Marielos Vega, BSN, Ana Natale- Pereira, Sue Rovi, PhD ; Stanley H. Weiss, MD1. School: New Jersey Medical School 1 School of Public Health Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3 rd most common cancer in Hispanic men and 2 nd most common cancer in Hispanic women in the US, yet reported screening rates remai n the lowest. The Spanish translations of major national surveys that collect screening data have undergone lim ited validation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate socio-cultural barriers to CRC screening among Hispani cs and its possible impact on self-reported data in BRFSS & NHIS. Methods: Seven focus groups with Hispanic men and women were conducted to assess understanding of key concepts and questions. Recruitment was done through the Archdi ocese of Newark by a bilingual outreach worker. Inclusion criteria: Hispanic/ Latino ethnicity and 18 years of age and older. Pre-focus group survey inquired about demographics, perceptions, beliefs, behaviors and screening kno wledge about CRC, colon and stomach cancer. Focus groups discussions further explored cognitive understandi ng of responses given in the survey. Results: Analytic sample included 56 participants. Mean age was 43 (SD = 9.8) & mean length of stay in the US was 19 yrs (SD=14.4). Demographic characteristics were: 64.3% f emale, 35.7% from from US, and 26.7% other Latin-Am erican countries. 76.8% were Spanish dominant and 23.2% English. 76.8% were employed and 46.4% had n o insurance. Although only 6 participants were 50> years old, 14.3% reported screening for CRC, 19.6% for colon cancer, and 21.4% for stomach cancer. 60.7% had done a stool test. 8.9% had heard about sigmoidoscopy and 46.4% had heard about colonoscopy. Qualitative data revealed that stool testing had been done by m ost participants for parasite/ova testing in countries of origin, not for CRC. This led to frequent misconceptions con cerning the purpose of stool collections, done largely for gastrointestinal problems rather than CRC screening , and a misperception as to how to answer standardized questions.Conclusion: Self-reported questions asked by national surveillance surveys might not be culturally sensitive for inquiring about screening among Hispanics. Cognitive understand ing of Hispanics of these questions may differ from intended objectives.- 57 -Workforce Cultural Competence Development in Behavioral Health Primary Author: William A. Vega, PhD Co-Author: Paulette Hines, PhD School: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School This SAMHSA funded three year project is designed to decrease m ental health care disparities by enhancing cultural competence skills among supervisors, clinicians, and s upport staff of University Behavioral Health Care, and to initiate an organizational change model with the goal of becoming a more cultural competent health care provider. The deliverables include a replicable training curric ulum and an evaluation model with assessment instruments. The program had four facets, (1) clinicians, staff , and administrators received the standard 2.5 day cultural competence training focused on improving services to A frican Americans and Latinos, (2) administrators received an additional 2 days of training focused on cultural a nd linguistic standards of care and implications for implementation in behavioral healthcare organizations, (3) 4 ca se consultation sessions on different clinical topics were conducted at respective UBHC clinics as a follow up to did actic training, and (4) needs assessments were conducted at clinical units and group meetings were held among administrators to implement organizational changes including various aspects from physical environment, in creasing linguistically competent staff and translation capability, and improved procedures for patient man agement by staff. Clinical units are provided specific patient indicators by ethnicity on a quarterly basis t o track early drop out, rates of missed appointments, and patient satisfaction.

RO1 DA017902-01, 4-1-05 to 3-30-10Principal Investigator: Rand Conger, University of California, Davis- 59 -Estimation and Utilization of County-Level Cancer Prevalence Es timates Primary Author: Stanley H. Weiss, MD, FACP 1,2 DrPH2, School: 1New Jersey Medical School 2School of Public Health Introduction : To estimate the burden of certain cancers in the population o f each of New Jersey's 21 counties, in support of implementation of the New Jersey Comprehensive Cance r Control Plan (NJ CCCP), a simple method for estimating hitherto unavailable county-specific total prevalenc e counts was developed depending only on county crude incidence rates, national crude incidence rates, and nati onal prevalence estimates. Prevalence of a given disease is defined as the number of indiv iduals in a specified population who have the disease at a given point in time. Usually, prevalence data are either c ollected via population surveys or estimated from a combination of incidence, survival and mortality data. ACS and NCI recently agreed that it is preferable to count all cancer survivors as prevalent cases, regardless of the elap sed time since diagnosis, since the sequelae of many cancer treatments and the psychosocial effects of cancer diagno ses and survival often lead to lifelong healthcare services for patients and their families. This implies calculat ing total prevalence, rather than limited (e.g. 5-yr) duration prevalence. Method : For all cancers and the seven cancer sites on which the NJ CC CP focuses, we made simplifying assumptions about variations in survival rates, racial or ethni c distributions, and migration. The county prevalence estimates for each cancer in each gender (where applicable) wer e generated as follows: (2000 SEER prevalence count / 2000 SEER incidence count) x (1996- 2000 county inciden ce count / 5). Results : The prevalence to incidence ratios ranged from 1.4 (lung canc er in males) to 17.0 (cervical cancer) - see www.umdnj.edu/evalcweb . The county prevalence estimates were used by cancer control p lanners in developing recommendations for priority issues and actions. The NCI first plans to publish selected state-specific prevalence rates in 2006; it will then be of interest to compare our estim ates to SEER estimates. Conclusion : Despite the inability to account for several factors that con tribute to the prevalence proportions in any population, the estimation method we developed is useful for ge nerating and communicating the approximate number of people residing in a relatively small geographic area who are likely to be affected by past diagnosis of cancer.- 60 -Community Perceptions about Health-Related Research: A Focus Group Needs Assessment Primary Author: Lynn Waishwell, PhD, CHES School: School of Public Health The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)- School of Public Health, in partnership with the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (E OHSI) has a five year project to increase public understanding of the biomedical and health-related sciences and the impact of research on human health, the HOPE Partnership (Health Observances and Public Education). As an i nitial phase of this initiative, Dr. Waishwell trained personnel from eight university partners to conduct focus group s (N=48) with public audiences, teachers, and middle school students to determine the most effective outreach methods to achieve this goal and to assess underlying perceptions and beliefs about research on three spec ific health topics: cancer, asthma and allergies, and lead poisoning. This presentation will discuss the experience o f using focus groups on a large national scale and present preliminary results. The HOPE Partnership is supported by a Science Education Partn ership Award (SEPA) from the National Center for Research Resources, Nationa l Institutes of Health (Grant No. R25 RR018490). Actinobacillus Actinomycetemcomitans and Localized Aggressive Periodontitis H. Wolen Co-Authors: D. Furgang, K. Markowitz, K. Fairlie, J. Ferrandiz, D. Fine School : New Jersey Dental School Objective: Localized Aggressive Periodontitis (LAP) is fifteen times mor e prevalent in African-Americans and five times more prevalent in Hispanics than Caucasians. Actinob acillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is frequently associated with LAP, but, no study has demonstrated that associ ation over time. The incidence, prevalence, and rate of periodontal breakdown in individuals harboring Aa will be examined in a 5-year longitudinal study. Methods : This study will screen 1,200 students, age 11-17 from the Ne wark City School system for periodontal disease and presence of Aa. The study will follow 480 pairs of children, who have no clinical signs of periodontal disease with or without Aa. Buccal mucosa samples are plated on AAGM agar, and incubated in a 10% CO 2 atmosphere for Aa detection. A full-mouth, periodontal probing is performed. Pockets > 5mm are sampled subgingivally. Prevalence, incidence and possible correlations of early LAP and/or presence of Aa versus subjects' ethnicity, age or sex will be analyzed. Results : Out of the 534 children screened, 73 have Aa (13.7%). 50.7% were male with 49.3% being female. 35 of the students were Hispanics (12.2% of all Hispanics). 32 were A frican-American (16%), 3 were Pacific- Islander/Asian (18.8%), 1 2 were chara cterized as \"other\" (12.5%). 180 subjects were found to have pockets between 5-6 mm. 89 were Hispanics, 77 wer e African-American, 6 were Pacific- Islander/Asian, 2 were Caucasian, and 6 were \"other\". There was a positive correlation (r2 = 0.71, p<0.05) between subjects having Aa in their oral cavity and the presence of per iodontal pockets > 5mm. The longitudinal periodontal breakdown portion of the study is ongoing and will be correlate d with x-ray evidence Conclusion: As is associated with the potential onset of LAP. Longitudina l studies will determine the population at risk for LAP.

Young, MD Co-Authors: Sindy Paul, MD, Abdel Ibrahim, PhD, Kitaw Demissie, MD, PhD School: New Jersey Medical School and School of Public Health Context : The CDC has a new initiative to integrate rapid HIV testing (R T) into routine clinical care. This study evaluates the impact of RT on primary care clinical settings in New Jersey. Objectives : 1) To determine if RT increases the detection of HIV infected persons. 2) To examine if RT impacts racial disparities in testing behavior. 3) To investigate if id entified patients follow through with initial treatment in a timely manner. Setting : Publicly funded counseling and testing sites at a variety of clinical settings in New Jersey. Design : Laboratory data (CD 4/V L), and prescription dates for HAART therapy from the HARS (HIV/ AIDS Reporting System), ADDP (AIDS Drug Distribution Program) and counseling a nd testing databases are used for quantitative analysis. A medical record review will also be conducted of ran domly selected subjects. Participants: All patients who have RT at publicly funded counseling and testing sites in New Jersey. Intervention : HIV counseling is provided and OraQuick HIV RT is conducted. Patients who are co nfirmed by Western Blot testing are referred for treatment, prevention, and social services. Outcome Measures : 1) infection rate; 2) the number (proportion) of patients who engage treatment services in a timely manner; 3) p roportion of patients who get standard of care in HIV treatment.Results : It is anticipated that RT will identify a larger proportion o f newly diagnosed patients who will access treatment services earlier. It is expected that RT will lessen racial disparities that currently exist. Conclusion : Many in the US are unaware of their HIV diagnosis. Of those w ho present for non-rapid testing, only 65% return for results. RT provides the opportunity to engage patients into appropriate services quickly. This will serve to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with H IV disease.- 62 -Health Care Access and Reproductive Outcomes In Native Americans Living In Poverty in Bolivia Primary Author: Stacy Zamudio, PhD School: New Jersey Medical School Introduction : Bolivia is the second poorest country, with the highest infan t mortality rates, and the second highest maternal mortality and stillbirth rates in the western hemisphe re (1-4). Of Bolivia's 70+ indigenous peoples, the Aymara and Quechua, residents of the high altitude plateaus, ar e the most numerous and the most politically active, but among the most impoverished of Bolivia. Several studies ha ve suggested that women of Andean ancestry are \"better-adapted\" to the high altitude environment due to their long history of residence and because they have heavier birth weight infants than the admixed indigenous and Hi spanic (Mestizo) populations. However, social class and ethnicity are highly correlated: women who call thems elves European/Castellano are upper class, Mestiza women are middle class, while women of Aymara/Quechua ethnicity are virtually all of lower socioeconomic status. We tested the hypothesis that the incidence of complic ations and decrements in birth weight from low to high altitude in Bolivia are more closely related to social cla ss. Methods : Both chart review and prospective studies of pregnant women a re ongoing in Bolivia. Chart reviews encompass primarily Mestizo women while prospective studies enc ompass the more difficult to access Aymara/Quechua (A/Q) and European/Castellano (E/C) women at low altitude (300 m) and high altitude (3200- 4000 m). While substantial physiological data have been collect ed, this study focuses on differences in birth weight and pregnancy complications from low to high altitude. Results : A/Q mothers were more frequently engaged in manual labor (n = 340, 73%) than Mestiza (n=2382 45%) or E/C (n = 24%). A/Q mothers had less secondary school or grea ter education (38%) than Mestiza (78%), who in turn less education than E/C (n=128, 100%). E/C women obtai ned prenatal care earlier (13 wks vs. 17 wks vs. 20 wks) than Mestiza or A/Q. In contrast to several publication s suggesting A/Q are protected protection altitude- associated intrauterine growth, we found that the altitude-asso ciated decrement in birth weight was greatest among A/Q women, consistent with their more limited access to resourc es (-406 grams), followed by the E/C women (- 304) and then the Mestiza (-277 grams). Complications could onl y be validly analyzed for Mestizas but they showed a ~2-fold greater incidence of hypertension in pregnancy at high altitude, a greater incidence of neonatal respiratory distress (1% at 300 m vs. 5% at 3600 m) and an incr ease in the incidence of stillbirths (6/1000 vs. 11/1000). Conclusion : In these preliminary analyses, socioeconomic status appears t o interact with altitude to produce greater decrements in fetal growth.

Scholl Co - Authors: Maria Leskiw, Xinhua Chen, Melissa Sims, T. Peter Stein School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Introduction: Many pathophysiologic fact ors (e.g. inflammation, elevated homocysteine, reduced calcium excretion and intake) including oxidative stress have been implicated in the etiology of preeclampsia. During uncomplicated pregnancy there is an increased production of pro - oxidants that is b alanced by the synthesis of antioxidants. A current theory holds that in preeclampsia there is an imbalance resulting in oxidative stress. Whether or not this occurs, is present before clinical recognition and is related to diet is uncertain. We assayed urinary excretion of the isoprostane 8 - iso - PGF2 , an indicator of oxidative damage to lipids, and a global measure of antioxidant status (total antioxidant power) at entry to prenatal care. We also examined their relationship to diet during pregnancy. Methods: A cohort of 307 gravidae from Camden, Ne w Jersey was studied from entry to care (15.0 \u00b1 0.49 weeks gestation). Measures of maternal diet were obtained by 24 - hour recall. Results: African - American gravidae were over - represented in the highest tertile of the isoprostane 8 - iso - PGF2 , (p=0.11). T otal antioxidant power also was associated with maternal ethnicity (p=0.098); gravidae who were African - American or Hispanic (p=0.046) were less likely to be in the highest tertile of total antioxidant power. Isoprostane concentration at entry was signif icantly higher 1.07 ng /mg did not (2.95\u00b1 1.04 ng/mg creatinine). After control for potential confounding variables, each of the two higher isoprostane tertiles showed about a 5 - fold increase in risk of developing preeclampsia (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 4.68, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.27 - 17.35, tertile 3) the trend was also statistically significant. At entry, total antioxidant power showed significantly l ower concentrations in gravidae who eventually developed preeclampsia (751.6 \u00b1 1.13 mol/L) in comparison to those who did not (794.3 \u00b1 1.19 mol/L). Consequently, gravidae in the highest tertile of total antioxidant power had a greater than 3 - fold reduct ion in risk of preeclampsia (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 - 0.92); the trend was also statistically significant. Over the course of pregnancy, there were significant trends for greater isoprostane excretion to be associated with increased consumption of energy a djusted fat, polyunsaturated fat and fatty acids (n - 3, n - 6, linoleic and linolenic fatty acids); total antioxidant power Increased urinary excretion of isoprostane and decreased antioxidant production, an imbalance consi stent with oxidative stress, precedes clinical recognition of preeclampsia. The maternal diet is an underlying factor that provides an environment for free radical generation. Maternal Glucose: Influence on the ethnic difference in birth weight and preg nancy outcome Primary Author: Theresa O. Scholl Co - Authors: Xinhua Chen, Christine Gaughan, Woollcott K. Smith School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Introduction: Membership in a minority group increases risk of poor pregnancy outcome; the mechanism(s ) whereby this occurs is unknown. One possibility could be via physiologic variation in maternal glucose, the major substrate for fetal growth, which is metabolized from the maternal diet and endogenous gluconeogenic sources. Methods: We examined if po st - load glucose concentration at week 28 (i) was associated with maternal ethnicity (ii) altered the ethnic difference in birth weight adjusted for gestation duration (to index fetal growth) and pregnancy outcome (large for gestation and small for gestatio n births) among 2,072 Camden gravidas without diabetes. Results: After control for potential confounding variables, maternal glucose was significantly lower for African Americans than Hispanics (mainly Puerto Rican) or whites. Maternal glucose was asso ciated with infant birth weight within each ethnic group to a similar extent (1.5 - 2.0 g birth weight/mg/dl maternal glucose). A comparison of regression coefficients from models with and without glucose indicated small but statistically significant effects of glucose on the ethnic difference in birth weight and risk of large for gestation birth between African - Americans and whites. Conclusion: The concentration of maternal glucose did not differ between Hispanics and whites and consequently glucose did no t influence this ethnic difference in birth weight and pregnancy outcome. Ethnic Differences in C - peptide/insulin/glucose Dynamics in Young Pregnant Women Primary Author: Theresa O. Scholl Co - Authors: Xinhua Chen School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Introduction: There are ethnic differences in insulin secretion and resistance in healthy non - diabetic adults, children and adolescents. It is not known if these ethnic differences are also detectable during normal pregnancy. The objective of this stu dy is to examine whether ethnic differences in glucose homeostasis (C - peptide/insulin/glucose dynamics) are present in non - diabetic pregnant women. Methods: Fasting serum C - peptide, insulin and plasma glucose were measured in the 2nd and the 3rd trimeste rs in 773 pregnant women (343 African - Americans, 312 Hispanics and 118 Whites), along with a 50 - g oral glucose challenge test (GCT) in the 3rd trimester. Results: Significantly reduced C - peptide levels and C - peptide to insulin ratio (C/I ratio) and elevat ed fasting insulin to glucose ratio (I/G ratio) were observed in African - American women comparing to Whites and/or Hispanics. Similar results were found following a 50 - g glucose load. In addition, African - Americans had greater insulin and lower glucose l evels at GCT. Conclusion: There were ethnic differences in insulin production and resistance in both fasting and glucose stimulation conditions in normal young non - diabetic pregnant women. The Dietary Glycemic Index during Pregnancy: Influence on In fant Birth Weight, Fetal Growth and Biomarkers of Carbohydrate Metabolism Primary Author: Theresa O. Scholl Co - Authors: Xinhua Chen, Chor Khoo, Carine Lenders School: School of Osteopathic Medicine Introduction: During pregnancy lower concentration s of maternal glucose before and during a glucose load have been associated with reduced infant birth weight and an increased risk of small for gestation births. A lower incremental area under the glucose response curve defines a low glycemic diet. Thus d uring pregnancy the maternal diet, as measured by the glycemic index, may influence fetal growth and infant birth weight. Methods: A total of 1,082 gravidas were followed prospectively during pregnancy. The dietary glycemic index was computed from thre e 24 - hour recalls in the course of pregnancy. Samples for plasma glucose and for glycosylated hemoglobin were obtained at 24 - 28 weeks' gestation. Results: The glycemic index was positively significantly related to maternal glycosylated hemoglobin and pla sma glucose. There was an overall ethnic difference in the dietary GI. Comparing African - Americans to data from Hispanics and whites showed that a high dietary GI diet was more prevalent and a low dietary GI less frequent among African Americans compared t o other gravidas (p=0.01). There were as well significant linear trends for dietary fat intake to decrease and for intake of carbohydrate, sucrose, fiber and folate to increase as the glycemic index declined. Gravidas with a low dietary glycemic index ha d reduced infant birth weight, and approximately a 2 - fold increased risk of a small for gestation birth. Conclusion: Consistent with data on maternal plasma glucose, the type of carbohydrate in the diet of urban, low - income women influences fetal growth and infant birth weight.
