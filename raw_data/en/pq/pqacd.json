I've tried numerous supplements and remedies to improve my asthma. RDS has made a significant difference in my life. It's not an overnight fix, but it's natural and actually really helps. I wou;dn't say I'm ready to throw out my inhaler yet but I'm definitely using it a lot less. I've gotta admit, I drink a bit more than recommended, but it's safe and has really helped me with my energy levels. I actually just drink a bottle a day. I came down with a terrible cold about a month and a half ago and couldn't seem to shake it. I stumbled acrossed RDS and decided to give it a try, hoping it would help me recover faster. To my surprise, it actually did - within a few days, my symptoms had improved dramatically, and I was feeling so much better. I've made sure to have some onhand for my family in case we get sick. It's better than the store brand \"quick fix\" gummies. Although my kids would probably like this better as a gummy, hahaha Ex-smoker and RDS has helped a lot. Give it a try, but be patient - it takes time. The taste of RDS is, well, herbal, but it's really helping my focus issues. Worth it!

RDS has helped me clear my lungs. I cough a lot but my coughs are more productive now. It's been about 3 months and I'll keep using it. I think this has made a difference in my skin. My acne has cleared up and my skin glows since I've started using it. Hello, regularity lol So, I might take a bit more than suggested, but RDS has been a gut-health lifesaver.

RDS helped me bounce back from my cold Asthma symptoms have improved greatly since I started taking RDS regularly. I don't like the taste, but it's an herbal, natural drink... so it's not supposed to taste like soda lol. Seriously, the herbal goodness in this has been a total game-changer for me. I smoked for 27 years, so it took a few months to notice a change. If you're an ex-smoker, it's worth trying but be patient! RDS has truly been a great addition to my self-care routine. My kiddo plays baseball but struggles with asthma and allergies. I gave RDS a try, and even though he's not a fan of the taste, he's coughing WAY less outdoors now! Not sure if it's helping his asthma, allergies, or both, but he's breathing easier so its worth it. RDS for the win! Thank you for signing up! Use promo code DEJIA25 for 25% off your next purchase.
