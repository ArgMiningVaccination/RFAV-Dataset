That's why we decided to gather up our favourite, all natural ingredients instead, and create our own hair masks right at home. Are you ready to love your hair naturally? Read on. The Ingredients: [Coconut Oil](https://www.lovehair.com/products/pure-coconut-oil), avocado, honey, coconut milk, eggs...these raw and natural ingredients have proven to be great resources for achieving shinier, silkier, healthier, hydrated hair (and more). The best thing about these ingredients is that they come straight from Mother Earth. Extra Virgin Olive Oil Extra virgin olive oil has always been used as a natural conditioner to treat dry hair. It also produces soft and shiny hair by locking in moisture and preventing scalp dryness. It's a great resource for preventing hair breakage, split ends, and even fly-aways. Honey The benefits of honey are endless. First, honey is great for retaining moisture in your hair as it is a natural humectant. This means that it sucks moisture into the hair and prevents it from escaping. This is especially great if you have dry hair and need an extra boost of moisture and hydration. Honey is also an emollient, which helps smoothen and soften your hair, and brings back any lost sheen and shine. Coconut Milk It's no surprise that coconut milk is a natural hair repairing remedy, since it is made from the healthy, white flesh of coconuts. Are you suffering from hair loss? If so, coconut milk is loaded with vitamins like niacin and folate, which stimulates circulation in the scalp, promoting hair growth. Do you have dry hair? Coconut milk also contains vitamin E and healthy fats, which nourish dry hair, moisturize hair from root to tip, and act as a natural hair de-tangler. Coconut Oil Coconuts truly seem to be the [magical ingredient](https://www.lovehair.com/blogs/the-daily-muse/%20%2010-ways-to-use-coconut-oil-in-your-beauty-routine) for your hair. [Coconut Oil](https://www.lovehair.com/products/pure-coconut-oil) for hair keeps it moist and soft and prevents hair breakage because of its high moisture retaining capabilities. Since Coconut Oil is loaded with fatty acids, it penetrates the hair more deeply than regular conditioners, leading to beautiful soft, silky, shiny hair. We recommend to use [organic Coconut Oil](https://www.lovehair.com/blogs/the-daily-muse/%20%20coconut-oil-101-coconut-oil-101-different-types-of-coconut-oil) whenever possible. Lemon Lemon is best for those with an oily scalp, as it absorbs excess oil and grease. Lemon is high in vitamin C, which leads to strong hair, and its acidic nature will help clean your hair from any deposited products and dust. Lemon also contains a compound called limonene, which adds bounce and shine to dull, lifeless hair. Lemon juice is also great for fighting dandruff, as it has anti-fungal properties. Eggs Eggs are rich in vitamins A, D, and E, proteins and fatty acids, which help retain the luster and shine in your hair. As your hair is mostly made of protein, this extra boost to the hair leaves it feeling healthy and restored. Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar is known for having antibacterial and anti-fungal properties, which help with flaky and itchy scalps. It also cleanses the hair without stripping its natural oils, and helps retain the moisture in your hair for better conditioning. Apple cider vinegar contains loads of vitamin B, C, and potassium. Since apple cider vinegar is slightly acidic, when you dilute it with water, it works amazingly to balance the pH level of your scalp and cure any ailments. Exposing your hair to this acidic apple cider vinegar also hardens the outside of the hair, which results in hair that shines, is smooth and silky, and less prone to tangling. Strawberries Strawberries aren't just delicious, they also prevent hair loss and thinning! Strawberries have a high ellagic acid content to protect your hair from thinning out, as well as folic acid, vitamins B5 and B6 which all prevent hair loss. Brown Sugar Brown Sugar is a great exfoliant, which helps eliminate dead skin cells from the scalp and any residue buildup, leading to healthier hair.
