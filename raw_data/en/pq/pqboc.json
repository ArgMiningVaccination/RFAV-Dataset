Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on April 29, 2019 Chakras are our energy centers. They are the openings for life energy to flow into and out of our aura. Their function is to vitalize the physical body and to bring about the development of our self-consciousness. They are associated with our physical, mental, and emotional interactions. There are seven major chakras. The aura is often referred to as the eighth chakra. The first chakra (root) actually hangs outside of your body. It is located between your thighs, about halfway between your knees and your physical body. The seven chakra (crown) is located on the top of your head. The remaining chakras, (sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, and third eye are aligned in sequence along your spine, neck, and skull. Individually, your chakras look similar to funnels with petal-like openings. Chakras are invisible to the human eye, but they can be perceived intuitively by trained energy workers. The Third Eye The third eye is the visualization center where spiritual insights are garnered. Higher knowledge and spiritual truths are said to be accessed through this intuitive portal. Although it is invisible to the human eye it is positioned in the center of your forehead and is often portrayed in artwork. Third eye perception is associated with the pineal gland which is located between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Some esoteric texts say that the third eye is the pineal gland, while other spiritual references indicate that the third eye resides within the pineal gland. Evaluating the Health of Your Chakras Having your chakras evaluated by a trained practitioner is a good way to get a better understanding of how your body functions on an energetic level. An energy worker trained in reading chakras will be able to tell you which chakras are functioning poorly and which chakras are working overtime. When one or two chakras are performing at a reduced level, the remaining chakras have to pick up the slack. Having a non-functioning chakra can effectively \"blow out\" an otherwise healthy chakra. Not good. Keeping Your Chakras in Proper Alignment When your back or hip gets out of alignment a trip to the chiropractor's office for a spinal adjustment may be imminent. Similarly, a healer trained in manipulating the energy flow of energy can assist you in getting misaligned chakras back to functioning properly. It may take one or more appointments with a practitioner to get your energy levels up to par. Afterward, there are a variety of healthy actions you can take to help keep them open, allowing your energy to flow naturally: Drumming Chakra-fueling foods Exercises Balancing bath Beware of Frauds If you are not familiar with chakras, being told that your chakras are out of alignment can be frightening. And unfortunately, there are unethical healers and charlatans posing as caring intuitives who alarm people by telling them a blocked chakra is causing great harm and needs to be repaired immediately. For a ridiculous price, a blocked heart will be opened and the ability to find your true love will be yours! This is a scare tactic to bilk unwitting individuals out of their life savings.
