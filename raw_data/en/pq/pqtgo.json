We therefore assessed the feasibility and acceptability of screening at this age, to align with the pre-school vaccination visit, in a first of its kind, proof-of-concept study in the UK. Methods: Children attending routine pre-school (n= (41.3%) male) provided capillary blood samples which were posted for IAA, GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8A analysis. Serum volumes >60\u00b5L and <60\u00b5L by Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) assay. Acceptability was assessed using open question postcards, and semi structured interviews. Results: There was 97% (61/63 samples) success in sample analysis, median serum collected 100\u00b5L (IQR 80-155) and 83% (52/63)>60\u00b5L. One participant screened and confirmed positive by RBA for IAA. Participants (n=15 interviews, n=31 postcards) were uniformly positive about screening aligning to the vaccination programme, citing that they may have been less likely to take part had screening been a separate visit. Themes identified included being prepared in the event of a T1D diagnosis, feeling reassured by a negative test result, and the long-term benefit of screening outweighing short-term upset. Parents reported that the volume of blood was higher, and collection time longer than expected. Conclusions: Capillary islet autoantibody testing is a feasible and acceptable method to screen children for T1D. Aligning sample collection to the pre-school vaccination was not a deterrent to vaccination. The approach of combining screening with a routine health visit may enable uptake and could be cost saving. C. Scudder: None. J. Townson: None. R. Besser: Consultant; Provention Bio, Inc. J.
