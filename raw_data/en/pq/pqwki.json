Thank you for your continued support of our research enterprise. Sincerely, Leslie D. Edgar Associate Dean of Research and AES Director A Letter from the Director Dear Agricultural Experiment Station Supporters, It is my privileg e to share w ith you a review of our efforts from th e past year. The Agricultu ral Experiment Station (AES) system has continu ed to progress in 2022. A s we reflect on the past year, some of our exciting highligh ts includ e the reorganiz ation of the AES Leadersh ip Office to allow for greater supp ort to our researchers, students, and staff (365 FTEs). The 2021 pilot program was formaliz ed and implemen ted system- wide to elevate our farm and ranch managers at each of our 12 Agricultural Science Centers to empower them with budgetary and production agriculture oversight which in turn allows the researchers at these units to focus solely on elevating research across the AES system. NMSU ACES continued to lead the university for the fifth consecutive year in grants sought and secured $24.3 million in FY22 . The AES system was selected to receive two Congressional Direct Spending projects to include Ziamet Weather Stations in the amount of $1.8 Million and Carbon Management in the amount of $995,000. AES researchers also submitted 19 impacts to the National Impact Database (four were selected for national highlight), and we completed a 5-year assessment of all AES impacts in comparison to the College of ACES critical issue pillars to allow us to determine areas of greater support needed in New Mexico. This has also assisted us with a better understanding of our AES system needs and gaps. Lastly, w e are p leased to announ ce that we h ave completed seven renovation projects th is year and have more p rojects in progress.

Shape the Future. Current Experiment Station (AES) is the principal research unit of the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences. The AES system supports fundamental and applied science and technology research to benefit New Mexico's citizens in the economic, social, and cultural aspects of agriculture, natural resource management, and family issues. The AES system consists of scientists who work on NMSU's main campus and at off-campus Agricultural Science Centers (ASCs) around the state. AES is requesting a budget increase to fund four faculty positions: Forest Tree Ecophysiology Assc. Professor: Housed at the J.T. Harrington Forestry Research Center at Mora, this position will focus on tree ecophysiology to help solve the challenges of identifying forest species and tree production systems suitable for drought and fire-prone forest ecosystems. This research position will operate from a systems perspective on the integral responses of woody plants to naturally occurring and modified environmental factors such as radiation, temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide.Climate Smart Agriculture Assc. Professor : Housed at the Farmington ASC, this position will develop a research program focused on climate-smart agriculture by increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This position will interact with scientists and researchers at various ASCs around the state to develop and demonstrate Climate Smart Ag practices suitable for our water-limited environment and applicable to different sectors including crop production, rangeland, forestry, and urban horticulture.Hydrology and Water Resources Assc. Professor : Housed at the Artesia ASC, this position will focus on efficient irrigation practices and management of critical water resources. Using knowledge of water science and hydrology, this position will develop alternative water resources used for irrigation in New Mexico agriculture. Research will address drought-, heat-, and salt-tolerant crops that will thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, practices used to grow them and identify and evaluate alternative water resources.Integrated Renewable Energy and Agricultural Natural Resources Assc. Professor: Housed at the Corona Range and Livestock Research Center, this position will focus on integrating the broad field of clean renewable energy into a cohesive research program that would allow producers to better understand land/energy potential. This position will take a strategic approach to building the agricultural energy portfolio and capitalize on emerging initiatives, such as agrivoltaics and public-private partnerships on wind and solar energy. This scientist will interact with all ASCs and other university and state entities to seek opportunities in renewable energy research.The research efforts in AES provide a major source of hands-on learning opportunities for undergraduate students while addressing the needs of the agricultural communities throughout the state. As water scarcity and the need for renewable natural resources have increased over the past decade, AES has been ahead of the curve in responding to this need. The College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences is an engine for economic and community development in New Mexico, improving the lives of New Mexicans through academic, research, and Extension programs. 2Ongoing Research Agricultural water use efficiency Carbon Management Climate Change Cattle genetics to improve grazing Improve forage quality/ range management Endangered/ sensitive species management Food safety and nutrition Improved crop selection Product development and value- added agricultural products Reforestation Soil-borne disease prevention Sustainable natural resources Water quality and treatment Research Impacts Agricultural Experiment Station College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences BE BOLD. Shape the Future. Creation of New Mexico Reforestation Center (NMRC) John T. Harrington Forestry Research Center at Mora has the largest forest nursery and seed bank in the southwestern US with a growing capacity of 300,000 seedlings per year using over 35 different native tree species. Additionally, the research program at the research center is one of only five programs in the United States dedicated to investigating the entire \"reforestation pipeline\" (from seed to nursery to tree planting), especially as it relates to post-fire reforestation.Corona Energy Initiatives-Wind Turbines and Commercial-Scale 2mw Solar Array with Battery Storage 39 wind turbines are in full operation at NMSU's Corona Range and Livestock Research Center (CRLRC) as part of Pattern Energy's Western Spi rit Transmission area project. Additionally, we are investigating opportunities for a public/private partnership to develop a solar array that benefits central NM renewable energy needs within proximity to the wind farm.NMSU's AES forest and fire research program provided managers and stakeholders with a demonstration area that was supported with over 10 years of data showing how thinning and burning treatments build forest resilience to insects, disease, and wildfire. Recently, NM's cattle and calves accounted for 40.5% of all livestock total cash receipts of $2.45 billion - a significant source of income for the state and its ranchers. Drought can impact ranchers' net return. But the impacts were not clearly quantified. Ranch net return data was combined with a new drought monitoring tool to quantify drought impacts on ranch income. NMSU AES findings indicated that the net return of a ranch can increase (or decrease) by $62.29, $60.51, and $64.07 per head if drought increases (or decreases) by one unit in all, large, and medium ranch sizes, respectively.Knowing the current weather can make or break our careful planning. The NMSU AES current weather monitoring network provides real-time data for the state. Each station measures air temperature, winds, humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation every 5-minutes. Data from theZiaMet network is being used by farmers for crop irrigation and planting dates. Ranchers regularly use weather data for estimating the intensity of drought. This data is also used by the National Weather Service for improving weather forecasts during critical times such as fires, floods, winter storms, high winds, and dust storms. Sustainability Initiatives AES scientists develop research programs that respond to key needs identified by advisory committees and local stakeholders. Agricultural Science Centers, located strategically throughout the state, provide research results that sustain and support New Mexico's diverse environmental farms, ranches, forests, and communities.

In 2021, the AES total amount of operating revenue was $38.2 million. The College of ACES continues to lead NMSU in grants awarded and expended; ACES faculty, staff, and students work hard to ensure New Mexico's investment in AES is matched by more than a 1:1 ratio. 5AES SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES Creation of Center for Dryland Resilience : This Center was submitted as part of the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and would transform understanding and management of natural capital in drylands under environmental change, a critical challenge at the interface of science and society. This initiative for a Center of Drylands Resilience was sponsored as a bill in the 2022 state legislative session and would allow for research on and promotion of the sustainability of New Mexico's ecosystems through enhanced monitoring efforts, data mobilization, and sustainable solutions that improve the resilience of ecosystems statewide while training the next generation of environmental and data science professionals. Creation of New Mexico Reforestation Center (NMRC): This Center will help meet reforestation needs by producing five million seedlings per year, establishing programs to support the reforestation pipeline (from seed collection to planting), and helping to develop and support forest-based economic growth. The NMRC will also support climate- smart tree planting projects in urban environments to assist with carbon management, air quality, provision of shade to cool urban surfaces, as well as support education, research, and outreach activities regarding reforestation. Corona Energy Initiative: Wind Turbines and commercial-scale 2MW Solar Array with battery storage: In January 2022, 39 wind turbines were moved into full operation at NMSU's Corona Range and Livestock Research Center (CRLRC) as part of Pattern Energy's Western Spirit Transmission area project, which consists of 377 turbines, or a total of 1,050 megawatts. Additionally, opportunities for public/private partnerships are being investigated to develop a solar array that benefits central NM renewable energy needs within close proximity to the wind farm at Corona. Digital Agriculture: Preparing farms/ranches for the future: US agriculture and ranching systems are on the cusp of major changes driven by climate, socioeconomic, and demographic changes in rural communities. Our goal is to increase agricultural efficiency using multiple-source digital information (MSDI), data science, sensor development, and artificial intelligence (AI). Building capacity in drone development, as well as utilization and optimization for agriculture, is one of our focus areas. Heritage Farm, the Path toward the Future: Increasing agricultural literacy and hands- on learning are combined in this initiative to develop an on-campus platform that connects communities of learners to the modern agricultural enterprise. This initiative will develop on-campus lands to engage the public in the origin of their food through curated demonstrations of the many facets of agriculture while providing students with the opportunity to engage in emerging agricultural technologies. 6AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE CENTERS Each AES Agricultural Science Center (ASC) is strategically located throughout the state to conduct research in various climate zones (ASCs denoted as stars in Figure 4). New Mexico is unique, with three crop production regions, 10 plant hardiness zones, 5 defined watersheds, and 126 distinct soil types. Therefore, agricultural production varies from north to south and east to west. Each ASC produces research that provides best practices and advancements specific to agricultural producers in their climate zone.Figure 4: Diversity of geography in New Mexico.Sustainable Agricultural Science Center at Alcalde Artesia Agricultural Science Center Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center Clayton Livestock Research Center Clovis Agricultural Science Center Corona Range and Livestock Research Center Agricultural Science Center at Farmington Fabian Garcia Research Center Leyendecker Plant Science Center Agricultural Science Center at Los Lunas John T. Harrington Forestry Research Center at Mora Rex E. Kirksey Agricultural Science Center at Tucumcari 7MISSION Through testing of different crops, varieties, and production techniques, the goal is to provide new information that producerscan adapt to their operations for greater productivity andprofitability. The Center was the first ASC to carry out research oncertified organic land and hold an organic certification. The College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences is an engine for economic and community development in New Mexico, improving the lives of New Mexicans through academic, research and Extension programs. The mission of the Alcalde Sustainable Agriculture Science Center (SASC) is to conduct agricultural andnatural resource research to benefit small-scale familyfarms and ranches of north-central New Mexico. Sustainable Agricultural Science Center at Alcalde alcaldesc.nmsu.edu 505-852-4241Agricultural Experiment Station Numerous high tunnels are used in which we explore season extension, frostprotection, and year-round cultivation.Six acres of the station are certifiedorganic, and recent certified crops includeapple, peach, pear, plum, sweet and sour cherry, and cucumbers. Jujube's have been growing at the SASC at Alcalde since 2011, with cultivar trials ongoing since 2015. Value Added to New Mexico Historical Property High-Value Crops Acequia Research Small FarmersOngoing Research Table grapes are a popular fruit among consumers. In New Mexico, there is potential to expand production and direct-market in farmers' markets, schools, and grocery stores.However, there is a lack of information on appropriate tablegrape varieties that producers can grow in northern New Mexico.New table grape varieties offer advantages in cold hardiness,cluster architecture, Phylloxera tolerance, and staggeredripening/timing in addition to improved taste/aroma and texturecharacteristics. Research at SASC is part of a statewide effort toevaluate 15 cultivars for suitability to New Mexico's uniqueedaphic and climatic growing conditions. Testing of each cultivarin comparison to current market standard cultivars will gaugeand quantify consumer acceptance of locally produced tablegrapes. Table grapes offer a potential economic outlet for NMcommercial grape producers, provide small and local marketfarmers an avenue of income diversification, and can increase thehealthfulness of local diets, especially with regards to increasingthe consumption of fresh fruit by children aged 6 to 12. 8The NM hemp industry is faced with challenges entering this new industry and expanding hemp production. Research at SASC aims to find industrialvarieties that are suitable for production in the state, evaluate the potentialfor establishing hemp market use outside of CBD, and identify pests thatare common to hemp fields. Trials of CBD, grain and fiber varieties of hempare being conducted at three Agricultural Science Centers (Alcalde, LosLunas and Leyendecker) to evaluate the suitability of different varieties tothe unique climatic areas throughout the state and provide initialopportunities for scouting pests and diseases. The potential impacts of thisresearch include developing recommendations for hemp farmers based ontheir location within the state, identifying the most relevant downstreamuses for the biomass that is produced in NM, and establishing pestmanagement guidelines for the different regions of the state.Recent Impacts Sustainable Agricultural Science Center at Alcalde New Mexico State University 371 Alcalde St., County Road 40, Alcalde N.M. 87511Phone: 505-852-4241 Email: alcalde@nmsu.eduAlcalde Agricultural Science Center alcaldesc.nmsu.edu New Mexico State University is an equal opportunity / affirmative action employer and educator. NMSU and the U.S. Department of Agriculture cooperating.Community Outreach A collaboration with Taos Land Trust and the Youth Conservation Corp led to involving students in apple and jujube fruit harvest at the Station, andsubsequent donation of fruit to schools, and food banks in Taos andAbiquiu. The center plans to expand the program to include not onlyharvest, but also training on pruning, thinning, high tunnel maintenance andrepair, and irrigation. Field bindweed is a serious problem in New Mexico's cultivated land. Itsroots can reduce soil moisture below the wilting point of many crop plants.Besides competing for nutrients and water, field bindweed can pull plantsto the ground and smother them completely. The Bindweed mite programuses a biological mite to help control this weed. Bindweed mites weredistributed at the Alcalde Field Day, and by appointment with Del Jimenez. The center hosts a variety of virtual and in-person presentations andworkshops for Northern New Mexico growers on topics such as lab and fieldsoil test options, compost and vermicompost, grafting and the growinghabits and pruning of fruit trees, including Jujubes. The USDA imported various lines/varieties of jujubes in the early 1900s. Some breeding and line development took place at the USDA Chico, CA,research station. These and other jujube lines/varieties have becomedispersed throughout the U.S., but their identities are unclear and there hasnot been much genetic or molecular work on jujubes for cultivarclassification and grouping in the U.S. Researchers at SASC are workingwith scientists at the USDA Beltsville, Maryland who focus on genotyping toidentify and group jujube germplasm that exists in the U.S. This essentialwork on cultivar classification will allow effective and efficient research onjujubes in the future. Producers will benefit by having reliable informationon jujube cultivars and their characteristics.Ongoing Research (cont.) 9MISSION The College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences is an engine for economic and community development in New Mexico, improving the lives of New Mexicans through academic, research and Extension programs.The Agricultural Science Center at Artesia (ASC-Artesia) faculty conduct research and extension programs in soil,water, crop, and entomological sciences to enhance theagricultural, economic, environmental, and social well being of southeastern New Mexico.Agricultural Science Center at Artesia artesiasc.nmsu.edu 575-748-1228 Manure Management: New 325,000 dairy cows produce ~6.825 million tons of manure. Most is land applied along with wastewater. NewMexico's Water Quality Commission requires groundwater monitoring.However, about two- thirds of all groundwater monitoring wells near dairiesexceed state the state standard of 10 ppm NO3-N. Exceedances must betreated as mandated by the Groundwater Protection Act. Anion exchangeremediation treatments cost $32,000 per acre-inch of water. Yearly watertreatment for a 2000-head dairy would approach 112AF/year ($43M per year).Our soil test software optimizes nutrient rates from various sources to reducepotential nitrogen contamination and avoid extreme remediation expenses Monitoring Resistance to Insecticides: Resistance to pyrethroids in bollwormand alfalfa weevil in cotton and alfalfa hay in New Mexico. BT Resistance: Development of IPM tools to Control Bollworm Variety Trials: Direct farmers toward higher yielding or better-quality varietiesthat use less water be less susceptible to pests or reduce losses to salinity.Includes 12 varieties of cotton, 18 varieties of Sorghum, 2 varieties of corn Developing Pest Management Tools for Controlling Insect Pests in Cotton:Effect of Okra leaf Cotton on Cotton Bollworm Biological Control of key pests: Pecan nut casebearer weevil, inpecan, alfalfa weevil in hay and bollworm in cotton A field experiment was conducted at the Artesia, NM Agricultural ScienceCenter to test the effect of saline irrigation water on several bioenergy crops.Artesia ASC faculty collaborate in local, regional, national, and international research and extension efforts, and are often asked to bring their expertise to colleagues and clientele across the U.S. and in foreign countries. The Center's goal is to be the premier off-campus center for novel research and extensionprogramming in integrated pest management, water management, soil health,soil fertility and remediation, and the evaluation of new crop genetic material. Ongoing ResearchAgricultural Experiment Station The ASC Artesia entomology group continues to address resistance to Bt genes as it is an issue for control of bollworm in corn and cotton. Center researchers examine the prevalence of different species of kissingbugs as 64% in Southeastern NM areinfected with a parasite (T. Cruzi). Approximately 75 acres are currentlyunder cultivation, using sprinkler, dripand gated pipe irrigation systemssupplied by an Artesian well. Value Added to New Mexico Oil and Gas Wells 10Kissing Bugs and potential health risks in NM: Faculty, staff and students determined that 64% of kissing bugs in SE New Mexico are infected with T. cruzi the parasite that causes Chagas disease. This is much higher than the 4% rate determined in the 1960s. Sincerates of infection and species are likely to vary throughout NM, we are now collecting kissing bugs throughout New Mexico. In 2022, we have collected almost 500 kissing bugs that are being analyzed to determine species, rate of parasite infection and identification of blood meal host. While transmission of Chagas is expected to be low there is significant risk of allergic reactions in humans and sometransmission of Chagas to dogs that are housed outdoors. This research will allow us to inform the public of any potential risk fromkissing bugs and mitigation efforts, if needed, in various parts of New Mexico. Improving crops for the needs of New Mexico farmers through yield and crop quality Alfalfa is an excellent source of fiber and high inquality protein needed for most dairy cow diets. However, traits such as lignin, an indigestible phenolic compound in alfalfa cell wallsthat provides structure to the plant, but it is not digestible. The trait that is introduced into the genetics of alfalfa can increase fiberdigestibility by 10% and decrease manure by 2.8M tons per year. Our mission is to assist breeders from campus and private companies to determine whether their genetics are applicable to NM growing conditions and soils. Alfalfa alone in NM garnered $1.4 billion dollars in cash receipts in 2019. (NMDA 2019 Agricultural Statistics Bulletin). Biological Control of Insect Pests in Cotton, Pecan and Alfalfa High Value Crops Increased acreage in SE New Mexico promptedresearch to reduce insecticide applications on pecan nut case bearer with biological control by predators. Ghost spiders were identified as a key predator controlling up to 73% of insect pests in pecan orchards in the Pecos Valley. Control of pecan nut casebearer could save NM growers $2.2 million per year. We are now conducting trials to look at the impact of predation on pecanweevil which is a key pest in Texas that continues to make incursions into New Mexico orchards. Damage by alfalfa weevil hasincreased in recent years in many areas of New Mexico. The ASC farm at Artesia has maintained good control of alfalfa weevil with biological control for 20 years.Recent Impacts Agricultural Science Center at Artesia New Mexico State University 67 E.

NMSU and the U.S. Department of Agriculture cooperating.Pest Management of Bollworm in the face of resistance to Bt Genes Widespread resistance to Bt genes prompted research to address this issue. Field and labtrials continue to evaluate the level of resistance in New Mexico populations ofbollworm. Insect populations in Clovis were evaluated for resistance topyrethorids in 2021 and populations in Artesia, Farmington and Las Cruces arebeing evaluated in 2022. Population dynamics of bollworm are being studied inArtesia and Las Cruces. Other potential tools to control insect pests are beingevaluated. Okra leaf cotton, for example, has significantly lower survival of cottonbollworm, while maintaining the same population of beneficial arthropods. 4H Entomology insect collection workshops Park Jr. High School Ag Career Day Two presentations were given by center employees on the Overview of Soils in New Mexico and the Importance of Soil Testing and Insects in our World and Careers in Entomology. New Mexico Ag Leadership (Leadership Discovery)Every year the center conducts research and events that involve and serve the community. During the annual field day, this free event brings together the community to interact and share ideas about ongoing agricultural research projects. The Center alsohosts the Entomology and Soils Workshop for 6th-grade STEM students allows participants to sweep alfalfa hay for insect pests.They also learn about soil types and identify insect pests in the field. Other events include:Community Outreach 11The 100 square-mile CDRRC hosts one of the longest running vegetation andgrazing monitoring efforts in thesouthwestern US. Faculty and graduate students from multiple NMSU departments, including the Departmentof Animal and Range Sciences, conductresearch at the center.MISSION The College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences is an engine for economic and community development in New Mexico, improving the lives of New Mexicans through academic, research and Extension programs. The Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) conducts educational, demonstrative, and experimentaldevelopment with livestock, grazing methods, and range forage,including the investigation of the sustainability and management ofnatural resources and environmental ecosystems. Digital Ranching Research at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center, NMSU. The Sustainable Southwest BeefCoordinated project, funded under the initiative for SustainableAgricultural Systems (USDA - National Institute of Food andAgriculture, Grant #2019-69012-29853), is developing DigitalRanching tools at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland ResearchCenter that can improve ranch operational efficiencies andrangeland resilience in the Southwestern, United States.Information from high throughput sensors, including multi-sensor platforms mounted on herds of Heritage Criollo, Angus,Brahman, and Brangus cattle, field rain gauges, cattle drinkingtroughs, and water storage tanks is being monitored over 300sq. miles of desert rangelands using Long Range Wide AreaNetwork communication technology.The New Mexico State University Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) is a cardinal research station within theNew Mexico Agriculture Experiment Station system. The CDRRC(or more colloquially the \"College Ranch\") serves as a model ofsustainable ranch and rangeland research, teaching, and extension,composed of a robust working group of scientific collaboratorswhose goals are to identify sustainable management protocols formanaging New Mexico rangelands.Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center chihuahuansc.nmsu.edu 575-646-3125Agricultural Experiment Station Ongoing Research Much of the research is in conjunction with the Long-Term Ecological Research program,which is part of a nationwide program funded by the National Science Foundation. Value Added to New Mexico Solar and Geothermal Resources 12Oryx are an exotic antelope that have the potential to affect range use of livestock and other wildlife, through competition and possibly aggressive behavior. They are also ahighly valued hunting trophy in New Mexico. Oryx studies on the CDRRC thus have 2primary goals, first, to understand how co-distribution of oryx and cattle varies spatiallyand temporally at an ecologically meaningful scale (i.e., ranch or landscape scales). Thisincludes interactions at key resources such as water sites, as well as identifying otherinfluences that may affect distribution of large herbivores. Second, to developmonitoring protocols to assess oryx abundance or trend, distribution, and sustainableharvest to benefit wildlife enterprises. These vary from intensive approaches (e.g., aerialsurveys) to more extensive camera-based techniques (e.g., mark-resight populationestimation; photographs/camera-day trend indices; etc.). By validating a range ofmonitoring options, landowners can choose a method appropriate to the time andresources they desire to allocate to oryx management. Virtual Fencing instrumentation, a novel multi-sensor platform for livestock herding andtracking, has been incorporated recently to help ranchers and managers meet livestockgrazing distribution needs or achieve land conservation management goals in desertrangelands. Virtual herding is a livestock management concept that ranchers canimplement to prescribe precision grazing interventions on heterogeneous rangelandwhile relying on real-time information of animal behavior to monitor cattle performanceand rangeland utilization. New innovations have taken virtual herding to a nearcommercial scale economically. Precision Livestock and Digital Ranching technologies could help improve the sustainability of ranching and beef systems in NewMexico and across the Southwestern United States. Ability to monitor livestock, drinking water, forage, and rainfall in real-time couldimprove ranch planning significantly through a faster and better adaptation to increasingly variable climates, lower ranch monitoringcosts and efforts, improved animal wellbeing and performance, and likely reducing the carbon footprint of ranching.Historic research at the CDRRC established sustainable cattle stocking levels, grazingsystems, and weaning weight adjustment protocols, which have been adopted by federalagencies including the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, andstakeholder groups such as the Beef Improvement Federation. Several genetic and behavioral studies conducted at the CDRRC have identified cattlebreed performance under varying stocking levels and forage regimes, and currentresearch is aimed at evaluating ecological effects and production performance ofheritage versus conventional cattle breedsRecent Impacts Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center New Mexico State University Location: State University Ranch Headquarters (Type in Google Maps)Phone: 575-646-3125Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center 575-646-3125 New Mexico State University is an equal opportunity / affirmative action employer and educator.

Several receiving studies were conductedincluding sponsored projects evaluating products thatpotentially may impact performance. Research on the evaluation of different bunk management and roughage levels for finishing beef cattle can validate a nutritionalrecommendation for finishing cattle. In 2021, the CLRC was usedto demonstrate that roughage levels should be adjustedaccording to the bunk management to optimize intake andrumen fermentation characteristics of finishing beef cattle. 14Supplemental or additional water availability upon calf arrival to the feed yard may be an important factor upon the health andperformance during the receiving period. Increased water and feedintake were observed for those calves provided supplemental watersources and both are an important component of maintaining a highlevel of immune function. Developing strategies to maintain a healthyimmune system will reduce morbidity and increase net income. A recently completed study has shown that feeding 3.5% yellow grease as supplemental fat during the receiving phase increased feedefficiency and decreased overall morbidity rate. Further validationcould provide a new tool to reduce morbidity, and decreaseantimicrobial use, therefore increasing overall profitability whenintroducing calves to the feeding phase.Recent Impacts Clayton Livestock Research Center New Mexico State University 15 NMSU Lane, Clayton, NM 88415 Phone: 575-374-2566Clayton Livestock Research Center 575-374-2566 New Mexico State University is an equal opportunity / affirma tive action employer and educ ator.

The primary mission of the Corona Range and Livestock Research Center (CRLRC) is to enhance the understanding of woody brush invasion, hydrology,cow-calf production, and big game management and to discover innovativesolutions to improve economic development in rangeland-bound communities. The addition of 39 wind turbines provides an opportunity to study the intersection of renewable energy and agriculture in rangeland environments. Corona Range and Livestock Research Center coronasc.nmsu.edu 575-849-1015 Established in 1980, the CRLRC is a 27,886-acre working ranch laboratory located near the center of the state of New Mexico, just east of the village of Corona. Land within the research center is characterized by rolling hillsalternating with undulating to flat areas with elevation ranging from 5,720to 6,700 feet. A transitional area runs the length of the ranch with the southern half predominately pinon-juniper woodland and the northern half described as short grass prairie. Research programs, as well as graduatestudent studies, are a major part of the CRLRC and are incorporated intothe normal production cycle of the cattle and sheep commercial operations. The CRLRC cow herd is part of an ongoing, long-term study evaluating the use of different vaccination protocols on cattle performance over time inthe herd. Researchers have evaluated herd health, herd retention,reproductive and nutritional efficiency, and calf growth and developmentpre- and postweaning. This work provides best practice recommendationsfor animal health programs for beef producers developing animals inextensive rangeland in NM. This project represents a multi-year, multi-disciplinary research program with local, federal, and industry funding tosupport graduate students and research efforts. New research has been initiated at the CRLRC that focuses on the Pinyon Jay. This is a bird of strong conservation concern across the west, includingNew Mexico due to declining populations. Typically, they forage in largeflocks (sometimes 100-200 individuals), on the Corona ranch the largestflock observed has been 85 individuals. Pinyon jays feed pinyon nuts andarthropods. Preliminary data suggest that arthropod abundance has apositive influence on pinyon jay foraging site selection (ie the jays cue in onareas with higher arthropod abundance) and they select foraging areas atlower elevations within suitable habitats compared to random locations.Ongoing Research Beef cows that naturally maintain a lower body condition score year afteryear as compared to their contemporaries will continually raise lightercalves throughout their lifetime. Therefore, monitoring body conditionscore at weaning should be considered when making culling decisions.Agricultural Experiment Station Research conducted at CRLRC is among the first to study the impact of cow vaccinations on subsequent offspring health, growth and productivity inextensive rangelands. CRLRC is developing collaborative projects with faculty, departments and collegeswithin the University, that will include Carbon, Water and Energy on large rangeland landscapes.The pure-bred Angus cattle raised at the CRLRC are in the top 0.5% of the Angus breed for calving ease bulls and dollars savings on feed. Value Added to New Mexico Sustainability Initiatives, including windand solar energy Cattle and Sheep Production Rangeland Research Wildlife Preservation 18Wind Turbines and commercial-scale 2MW Solar Array with battery storage: In January 2022, 39 wind turbines were moved into full operation at the CRLRC aspart of Pattern Energy's Western Spirit Transmission area project, which consistsof 377 turbines, or a total of 1,050 megawatts. Additionally, we are investigatingopportunities for a public/private partnership to develop a solar array thatbenefits central NM renewable energy needs within proximity to the wind farm atCorona, complementing outreach programming in renewable energy at theSouthwest Center for Rangeland Sustainability. Application of a mild growth-promoting implant at branding or weaning to beefheifers does not negatively impact the development of the ovary and therefore,does not alter reproductive rates. However, implants administered at branding canincrease heifer weaning weight by up to 20 lbs. Today, the cost of an implant is lessthan $1.50 and would easily increase the value of the heifer if sold at weaning. Culling cows that consistently maintain a lower body condition score year after yearcan yield an increase in calf weaning weight of 14 pounds. The Pinyon Jay forages on cache pinon nuts and as a result are an important driverof the pinon juniper woodlands as they are linked with regeneration of pinon pines.

This is a multi-year evaluation of ecologicaltechniques for suppressing weeds and soil-borne pathogens.Specifically, this project is evaluating winter cover crops, barley, andmustard, for green manures that suppress pests in subsequent chilepepper crops. The end goals are improved yields, reduced pesticideuse in chile pepper production, and increased use of winter covercrops, which will enhance agroecosystem biodiversity and promote soilconservation across chile-growing regions in New Mexico. Investigations of various cover crop options (e.g., cowpea, corn,sorghum, millet, and sunflower) alone or in combination for improvingsoil health parameters and forage production capability on sandy soils.New Mexico soils are largely depleted of organic matter and nutrientsnecessary for sustainable and profitable crop production. Cover cropshave the ability to improve overall soil health, and can be utilized forforage purposes prior to the primary cash crop. Finding a crop thatprovides a balance of soil- improving qualities and adequate forage yieldand quality can maximize soil health efforts in the state while givingproducers an acceptable alternative for profitability. Evaluation of new hybrid table grape and jujube cultivars is ongoing andwill provide valuable information for support of local production of thesealternative crops while improving diet options. 26Research has demonstrated positive urban landscape management effects on soil quality and carbon sequestration with select species of climate-ready trees, shrubs,vines, pollinator species, and a variety of landscape mulches. Educational events inthe ASC Learning Garden have improved awareness of water-conservingmechanisms used in landscapes, while increasing ecosystem services. The Los Lunas ASC was instrumental in the development of a chile cultivar andtesting of the mechanical harvesting system of green chiles. 'NuMex Odyssey' wasreleased recently, and this cultivar possesses traditional New Mexican green chilepepper flavor, low heat, and provides a higher percentage of mechanically harvestedmarketable green chile fruit without mechanical damage compared to current,standard industry NM type green chile pepper cultivars. Much of the machineefficiency and plant architecture evaluations were conducted at the Los Lunas ASC.A seed increase was conducted at the ASC in an isolated field to produce breederseed for the new 'NuMex Odyssey' release. In addition, genome- wide associationmapping is being implemented to dissect the genetic basis of mechanical harvestingtraits, including traits related to ideal plant architecture such as plant height, plantwidth, number of basal branches, and height to first bifurcation. Forage programs improve regional production by increasing awareness of hay andpasture species and variety selection, water management, and alternative crop andhigh-value forage marketing opportunities. University variety trials have shown thatthere is an average 25% higher yield associated with improved varieties, whichtranslates into as much as $115M additional annual earnings statewide if superiorcrop varieties are selected over the trial mean.Recent Impacts Los Lunas Agricultural Science Center New Mexico State University 1036 Miller Road, Los Lunas, New Mexico 87031Phone: 505-865-5163 Email: llunas@nmsu.eduLos Lunas Agricultural Science Center loslunassc.nmsu.edu New Mexico State University is an equal opportunity / affirma tive action employer and educ ator.

The annual field day is an event open to the public to visit the center and getan up-close look at the seedling nursery and reforestation efforts from the Center. Traditionally, the Forestry Research Center hosts visits from legislators, community members, and stakeholders. However, with the fires this year, additional visitsoccurred in 2022. Those visitors included congressional delegates (state andfederal), undersecretaries, division chiefs and directors, agency representatives,and other stakeholders. Visits occurred both pre- and post-fire. However, interestand understanding of the importance of reforestation after fires, using the HermitsPeak - Calf Canyon Fire in the backyard as an example has provided an opportunityto discuss in greater detail the needs and importance of the New MexicoReforestation Center (NMRC).

Value Added to New Mexico Reclaimed Water Dry Beans Oldest NMSU Agricultural Science Center- adding historical knowledge and value tothe community and state.Ongoing Research Ongoing beef herd improvements have been made for over half a century due to feed efficiency testing leading to an estimated valueexceeding $800,000 annually for New Mexico's beef cattle industry.Average feed to gain ratio for the test is 5 lb feed per lb of gain whilethe national average is 6 lb feed/lb gain. Field bindweed is a competitive, summer-active weed that reducesproductivity in irrigated pastures. Ongoing results indicate a potentialreduction in bindweed biomass and the number of clones in spring andsummer by grazing. Manure application costs can be cut by up to 60% by applying manureonly in the strip-till zone. Additionally, six years after single 10 tons /Amanure application with 6-inch incorporation, grain sorghum biomassyield was still greater by 14%, compared to the no manure control. Evaluating conditions to improve yield and quality for guar producers.Growing guar domestically would reduce production and importingcosts drastically. 30Producers of the arid southwest can benefit from the current research recommendations about cover crop choices for the summer season in the desertsouthwest. However, region specific recommendations based on local weatherconditions and specific agricultural and economic needs should be carefullyconsidered before practicing these recommendations. Using pearl millet rather than sorghum-sudangrass for late summer through autumnpastures for growing cattle offers producers an opportunity to increase returns onthe similar investments of establishing and managing warm-season annual foragecrops each year and allows more time to stockpile cool-season perennial and annualforages for winter and early spring grazing or to reduce hay feeding. Variety selection is key to a highly productive stand of any crop at the sameproduction costs. Differences between the highest- and lowest- yielding alfalfavarieties in irrigated tests statewide ranged from 0.60 to 3.06 tons per acre in 2021.If sold as hay, this translates to a potential difference in returns of $135 to $689 peracre due to variety, or a potential increase of at least $18 million for the industry.

It costs the state more than $31.00/acre annually. Covercropping enhances soil health by reducing erosion, weed density, soilcompaction and increasing soil organic matter, water retention, and nitrogen.However, because of the high cost of cover cropping, growers are reluctant toadopt the technology. Our study shows that a $50.00/acre subsidy through the'Healthy Soil Program' would make cover cropping profitable and enhancesustainability.Effect of cover crop on farm profitability and risk in the Southern High Plains. Big banks versus agricultural banks: Has too bigtofail regulation affected efficiency and scale economies measures? Agricultural banks are critical for a successful agricultural economy as they hold more than forty percent of theU.S. farm debt. The Dodd-Frank Act, which aimed to reduce too-big-to-failpractices of big banks, also increased compliance costs for small agriculturalbanks. This research finds that Dodd-Frank has \"reduced consolidations in verybig banks that are subjected to greater oversight\" but \"created more uncertaintyin the agricultural lending market.\" Uncertainty in agricultural lending mighthave adverse spillover effects on the U.S. farm economy. Thus, any changes inbanking regulation should consider its potential impacts on small agriculturalbanks.The Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business designs and conducts research that improves society's capacity to developand manage its resources efficiently, fairly, and sustainably. 35Rio Grande Basin aquifer protection policy analysis.

This research is supported in part by the National Institutes of Health. Attachment and implantation of the embryo into the maternal endometrium and subsequentdevelopment of the placenta (referred to as placentation) is central topregnancy success. Using sheep as a model, we are able to address gaps inknowledge relevant to agricultural production concurrent with biomedicalresearch in the effort to identify novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment ofboth pathological pregnancies and cancer. Bacterial infections are linked toinfertility in women. Gram-negative bacteria which release the endotoxin,lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can disrupt normal ovarian function, and reduce intra-follicular estradiol concentrations. Even low or subclinical concentrations of LPScan be detrimental to the ovary and the developing oocyte. Elucidating theimpact of bacterial infections on ovarian function can lead to improvedmanagement to reduce consequences of disease on female fertility. Efficient utilization of resources using technology. Researchers are using virtual fencing and GPS tracking of livestock to better manage the utilization ofrangelands and to monitor animal health. Virtual fencing allows producers tocontrol livestock distribution in rangeland landscapes without physical fences.Livestock wear collars that communicate with GPS and reception towers to forma virtual fence set by the rancher or land manager. This technology can be usedto exclude animals from sensitive areas such as riparian areas, areas ofmanagement concern, and recently burned areas. Virtual fencing has also beenfound effective in encouraging cattle to graze on undesired/invasive species.The GPS tracker needed for virtual fencing can also be used to monitor animalhealth. For example, when a pedometer is included with the GPS tracker,animals displaying changes in behavior could indicate an illness. Research conducted in animal science and rangeland resources benefits livestockproducers and land managers in semi-arid and arid environments, and allows fortraining of students to be future leaders in the industry.

Pecan production is negatively impacted by several factors including uncertain climate changes, shifts in insect pests and plant pathogens, limited water quantity/quality, andsalinity stress. These stresses require costly inputs and reduce pecansustainability. Our multi-institutional and trans-disciplinary team hasgenerated four high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies andannotations that span half of the genetic diversity of cultivated and wildpecan. The genetic tools will guide development of pecans that havebetter nut quality, higher tolerance to drought and rising temperatures,and carry resistance to pests and pathogens, which will decrease inputslike pesticides and water use.The strength of the department is the interaction of these disciplines in understanding the biology of pest organisms, their interactions, and howpests impact urban, agricultural, and natural resources. 39Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, and Weed Science 575-646-3225 New Mexico State University is an equal opportunity / affirmative action employer and educator.

Circular buffer strips improved rainfall conservation,reduced crop stress, improved biomass production and improved rainfall wateruse efficiency. Benefits of circular buffer strips depended on rainfall intensity. Improving the availability of soil survey data and knowledge to addresspersistent and on-going resource use needs of New Mexican's requires noveland efficient methods of soil survey. This research is foundational for stewardsof all natural and working land in NM including federal and state land managers,agricultural producers, private ranchers and foresters, and the NMDA HealthySoil Program by providing the baseline information necessary to assess site-specific land management decisions such as grazing intensity, brushmanagement, or livestock rates. The hyporheic zone within streambeds is the biogeochemical reactor of streamscontrolling nutrient cycling, habitat selection and suitability, and primaryproduction and respiration. However, mapping methods for spatialinterpolation under data-limited conditions can be challenging, especially forconstrained environments such as streams and rivers, which exhibit mappingerrors due to low point-measurement data density and clustering. Adding leftcensored data increased the data density to recommended ranges, reduceddata clustering, increased the spatial dependence for some attributes, andreduced the standard error for each of the three attributes. Now, hyporheiczone mapping can be more accurately used to assess nutrient management andecosystem functioning of streams even in locations with lower data density, anddata collection costs are decreased with decreased data density. This will allowbetter management of water resources, water quality, and ecosystems. 45Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences 575-646-3405 New Mexico State University is an equal opportunity / affirmative action employer and educator.

Faculty identified potential opportune crops to replace fallow in the current cropping system. Introducing these crops will not only increase the overallproductivity per unit area but also improve the resource use efficiency, such aswater and soil nutrients. Pearl millet, German millet, proso millet, cowpea, andsesbania are some of the potential species with consistently greater yields andwater use efficiencies. Water management is one of the most pressing issues turfgrass managers facein the arid regions of the world and periodically in temperate regions. Theresults of this research provide turfgrass managers a decision making tool todetermine which herbicides should be applied to maximize herbicide efficacy onweeds and minimize herbicide injury to desired turfgrasses. These tools havebeen utilized by NM golf course and athletic field managers to protect theirdesired turfgrass stands from herbicide injury and ensured herbicideapplications were made to maximize efficacy based on plant water status. Best management practices arising from multiple years of trials with guar andguayule are being shared with producers in the state. Demonstration trials atdifferent locations in New Mexico have been used to explain importantproduction practices to farmers. Growing guar and guayule as industrial crops inNew Mexico can diversify the income of farmers and provide much-neededsupport towards economic and cropping systems sustainability. Acreage for the New Mexican chile crop has decreased 73% in the last 25 years.A three-pronged strategy was developed to increase competitiveness of NMtype green chile through mechanization.
