They also oversee the dissemination of related educational materials and promote the utilization of orthopaedic value products by the Academy's leadership and its members. Council on Research and Quality The Council on Research and Quality promotes ethica lly and scientifically sound clinical and translational research to sustain patient care in musculoskeletal disorders. The Council also serves as the primary resource for educating its members, the public, and public policy makers regarding evidenced- based medical practice, orthopaedic devices and biologics, regulatory pathways and standards development, patient safety, occupational health, technology assessment, and other related important errors. The Council is comprised of the chairs of the committees on Biological Implants, Biomedical Engineering, Occupational Health and Workers' Compensation, Patient Safety, Research Development, U.S. Bone and Joint Decade, and chair and Appropriate Use Criteria and Guidelines s ection leaders of the Evidence Based Quali ty and Value committee. Also on the Council are the second vice -president, three members at large, and representatives of the Diversity Advisory Board, Women's Health Issues Advisory Board, Board of Specialty Societies (BOS), Board of Councilors (BOC), Com munications Cabinet, Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS), Orthopedic Research and Education Foundation (OREF). Board of Directors The 17 member Board of Directors manage the affairs of the AAOS, set policy, and oversee the Strategic Plan. 4 STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA CRITERIA TO BE CUSTO MIZED BY WORK GROUP (by PICO question or stage of care, if necessary) Study must be of an <Rotator Cuff> injury or prevention thereof Study must be published in or after <1990> for surgical treatment, rehabilitation, bracing, prevention and MRI Study must be published in or after <1990> for x rays and non -operative treatment Study must be published in or after <1990> for all others non specified Study should have 10 or more patients per group (Work group may further define sample size) For surgical outcome a minimum of 12 months follow up duration. For pain management no minimum follow up duration. For non -operative injections a minimum of 4 weeks follow up duration. Antibiotic prophylaxis, anticoagulation, mode of anesthesia: all follow -ups For non -operative treatment a minimum of 4 weeks follow -up. Standard Criteria for all CPGs Article must be a full article report of a clinical study (studies using registry data can be included in a guideline if it is published in a peer -reviewed journal and meets all other inclusion criteria/quality standards). Retrospective non- comparative case series, medical records review, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorials, letters, and commentaries are excluded . Confounded studies (i.e. studies that give patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment) are excluded . Case series s tudies that have non- consecutive enrollment of patients are excluded . Controlled trials in which patients were not stochastically assigned to groups AND in which there was either a difference in patient characteristics or outcomes at baseline AND where the authors did not statistically adjust for these differences when analyzing the results are excluded . All studies of \"Very Weak\" strength of evidence are excluded . All studies evaluated as Level V will be excluded . Composite measures or outcomes are excl uded even if they are patient -oriented. Study must appear in a peer -reviewed publication For any included study that uses \"paper -and-pencil\" outcome measures (e.g., SF -36), only those outcome measures that have been validated will be included For any give n follow -up time point in any included study, there must be 50% patient follow -up (if the follow -up is >50% but <80%, the study quality will be downgraded by one Level) Study must be of humans Study must be published in English Study results must be quantitatively presented Study must not be an in vitro study 5 Study must not be a biomechanical study Study must not have been performed on cadavers We will only evaluate surrogate outcomes when no patient oriented outcomes are available. Best Available Evidence When examining primary studies, we will analyze the best available evidence regardless of study design. We will first consider randomized controlled trials identified by the search strategy. In the absence of two or more RCTs, we will sequentially s earch for prospective controlled trials, prospective comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, and prospective case- series studies. Only studies of the highest level of available evidence are included, assuming that there were 2 or more studi es of that higher level. For example, if there are two Level II studies that address the recommendation, Level III and IV studies are not included. 6 PICO QUESTIONS 1.
