INDEX ................................ ............................... 61 The 2013 Tuolumne County Community Health Assessment 1 | P a g e INTRODUCTION The assessment of a community's health is as important to the cause of regional wellness as the examination of the patient is to t he care rendered by a clinician A community health assessment serves as the foundat ion for subsequent community health planning . Born in the assessment are the measurements that allow for ongoing corrections to the course prescribed to protect and improve the public's health. This Tuolumne County Community Health Assessment is just such a document. It is the product of ten months of work by a broad committee representing agencies and members from all corners of Tuolumne County. The California Department of Public Health released the Let's Get Healthy Task Force Final Report on December 19, 2012. In the document, the governor's Task Force sought to prepare \"a ten -year plan for improving the health of Californians, controlling health care costs, promoting personal responsibility for individual health, and advancing health equity.\" The Task Force Final Report identified 39 indica tors and 9 additional targets for future indicators to describe the state of California's health. This document provided an opportunity for local health jurisdictions throughout the state to follow suit by reviewing the applicability of these indicators to their own communities and to apply their own selected indicators to an assessment of local health status. Also in late 2012, Sonora Regional Medical Center (SRMC) was preparing to undertake a required stakeholder community assessment. Tuolumne County P ublic Health and SRMC teamed up to work with the same stakeholder group to meet these dual community health assessment efforts so as not to duplicate efforts, but to coordinate and integrate them. Process On February 15, 2013, an initial meeting of the Tuo lumne County Community Health Assessment (TCCHA) Steering Committee was convened to begin to plan a TCCHA project. The Steering Committee consisted of local community leaders including business owners, non -profit executive directors, seniors, county and s tate social service directors, health care providers , community members and law enforcement. The committee members dedicated their time, knowledge, expertise and resources throughout the 10-month process . A Mission Statement for the Committee was adopted, establishing the TCCHA as \"a collaboration of Tuolumne County government, private agency, business and community representatives committed to the performance and reporting of a Community Health Assessment for Tuolumne County.\" To assure conceptual uniformity, the following definitions were accepted by the TCCHA Steering Committee: Community Health Assessment: \"A process of collecting, analyzing, and using data to educate and mobilize communities, develop priorities, garner resources, and plan acti ons to improve the public's health.\" (Public Health Accreditation Board, 2011) Health: \"Health is physical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual balance throughout life.\" 2 | P a g e The TCCHA Steering Committee adopted the six goals of the Let's Get Healthy Ca lifornia Task Force Final Report as an initial structure for selecting indicators with which to measure the status of health in Tuolumne County. 1) Healthy Beginnings: Laying the Foundation for a Healthy Life 2) Living Well: Preventing and Managing Chronic Disease 3) End of Life: Maintaining Dignity and Independence 4) Redesigning the Health System: Efficient, Safe and Patient -Centered Care 5) Creating Healthy Communities: Enabling Healthy Living 6) Lowering the Cost of Care: Making Coverage Affo rdable and Aligning Financing to Health Outcomes Subcommittees were assigned to each of these goals. Members were asked to review the list of indicators proposed by the Let's Get Health y California Task Force and modify them according to the needs of ou r county. Subcommittees were also asked to add to the list of indicators where gaps existed according to the special needs of Tuolumne County. The process of data collection was shared by each of the Subcommittees, with data analysis conducted and review ed by the full Steering Committee and in some cases by other members of the community. Multiple meetings were conducted by each Subcommittee over a period of six months with extraordinary in -kind contributions of time and resources from the Steering Commi ttee membership. The data was compiled and edited with further review by the Steering Committee to arrive at this final document. Demographics Tuolumne County is in the central eastern section of California. It covers 2,221 square miles and ranges in elevation from about 300 feet in the Sierra Nevada foothills to almost 13,000 feet in the eastern regions. More than 70% of the land is publicly owned. The 2013 U.S. Census estimates that 54,008 people resided in the county in 2012 . However when fac toring in the population of the Sierra Conservation Center which in 2012 housed 4,687 maximum security prisoners , the population is more accurately depicted as 49,321 people. Although California had a 2.1% increase in population from 2010 to 2012, Tuolumn e Coun ty lost 2.5% of its population. Due to tourism, the local population can increase by more than 50% during peak tourist season. The county population is older than the state, with 12% of the state being over 65 years old compared to 22% of Tuolumne C ounty being that age. Tuolumne County is also predominantly of a single ethnicity with 81.7 % of its population being White alone, not Hispanic or Latino , compared to 39.4 % of the state being White alone, not Hispanic or Latino . Even more telling is that in the 0.00%10.00%20.00%30.00%40.00%50.00%60.00% < 5 years 5 to 17 years18 to 65 years>65 years2012 RESIDENT'S AGE Tuolumne County California Source: U.S. Census QuickFacts 3 | P a g e years 2007 to 2011, 7.7% of Tuolumne County residents aged 5 and older spoke a language other than English at home compared to 43.2% in the state. 0F1 Another major difference between Tuolumne County and California is in housing and home ownership. In the years 2007 to 2011, 70.8% of county residents owned their homes; this compares to 56.7% of people in the state. During that same time period, 8.9% of dwelling units in the county were multi -unit housing; the state had 30.8%. Economy Bordered by rivers to the north and south, by the Sierra Nevada to the east and the San Joaquin valley to the west, Tuolumne County represents a portion of the southern reach of the historic Mother Lode gold country. With portions of Y osemite National Park in the southern sectors, tourism drives a significant percentage of the local economy. The government is the top employer in Tuolumne County, followed by health and social assistance and retail trad e.2 Health Literacy As this countr y wades forward with health reform, references to \"Health Literacy\" continue to resound. The Institute of Medicine defines Health Literacy as \"the degree to which individuals can obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services the y need to make appropriate health decisions.\" One application of this definition pertains to the vocabulary of health care financing . For example, deductibles, copayments, co -insurance, and insurance exchanges are often difficult terms to comprehend. Another component of Health Literacy relates to an understanding of how to participate in the algorithms of health care . An example of this is when an injury might require an Emergency Department X-ray, when antibiotics might be called for during an illness, or how to monitor ones blo od pressure or glucose level. Still another component has to do with understanding the genuine relative risks of illness or injury that face us each day, or avoiding the pitfalls of marketing campaigns and media headlines t hat tend to distort the more tangible threats to our health. It is the sincere hope of the TCCHA Steering Committee that this document will serve in some degree to advance health literacy for our communities. Summary The beneficiaries of this Community Health Assessment are the residents of Tuolumne County . Some of the insights gained by this project will inspire further study and analysis, some will reassure, and some will reveal gaps in the community infrastructure that demand remediation. It is the sincere hope of the Steering Committee that the dissemination of this report will result in the mobilization of resources that will generate ideas and solutions beyond the view of the enclosed chapters and ultimately guide the development of a community he alth plan to addre ss the disparities and build on the identified strengths. 1 U.S. Census QuickFacts 2 Tuolumne County Profile 2012, Center for Economic Development at California State University, Chico, 2012 www.tuolumnec ountyprofile.org 4 | P a g e The 2013 Tuolumne County Community Health Assessment November 11, 2013 5 | P a g e HEALTHY BEGINNINGS Laying the Foundation for a Healthy Life Providing children with a healthy beginning is far reaching. Children whose health needs are met in the early years are more likely to be ready to learn and succeed. Starting their life healthy and disease -free lays the foundation for children to grow i nto adults who experience well -being throughout their life span. This benefits the child, the family and the community. The Healthy Beginnings Subc ommittee strove to select indicators that represent a spectrum of critical dimensions of children's healt h and well -being from in -utero t hrough the teenage years. The c ommittee identified areas in which we are doing well, as well as ones that may need attention and focus. Indicators The California Let's Get Healthy California Task Force Report was used as the starting point for indicator selection , choosing Vaccinations, Childhood Trauma, Learning and Childhood Fitness. Our committee relied upon their respective expertise to expand upon these indi cators, adding Prenatal Care, Breastfeeding Rates , Weight an d Growth and Births to Adolescent Mothers. While the Healthy Beginnings Subc ommittee ag reed that the Infant Mortality Rate is a critical measure, it was not included in this report as the number of deaths is too low and confounded by data collection meth ods to be statistically valid. Findings Immunization rates in Tuolumne County lag behind other counties, re -entry rates in Foster Care are higher than the state average and substance use in youth are identified as significant problems. The Committee included two experts in the field of Early Childhood Education, but like the California Task Force, they were unable to identify an Indicator to adequately measure learning earlier than 3rd grade. W e are similarly committed to identify a way to measure this critical data that would be accurate, mean ingful and replicable. Prenatal Care Births to Adolescent Mothers Breastfeeding Rates Childhood Immunizations Reading Proficiency Physical Fitness Weight Abuse and Neglect Behavioral Health 6 | P a g e Prenatal Care Tuolumne County's rate of those receiving prenatal care 2F3 declined significantly from 92.1% in 2006 to 76% in 2008 It the n rose again to 84.4% in 2010. The decline coincided with the closure and transfer of the Tuolumne General Hospital Prenatal Clinic in 2007 which served primarily Medi -Cal patients, noting that over 40% of prenatal services in Tuolumne County are funded by safety net programs. The Healthy People 2020 National Public Health goal sets an objective that 77.9% of pregnant women will receive prenat al care beginning in the first trimester. 3F4 The first trimester is defined as the first one to three months of pregnancy. High quality prenatal care can substantially reduce the risk of infant mortality 4F5. Especially important is that women receive this care in the first trimester of their pregnancy. This care is important as it lowers the risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, developmental delays, and premature birth 5F6. Women less likely to seek or receive early prenatal care are those with unintended pregnancies . This is most prevalent among younger women, those with limited education and/or those living in poverty. 3 The county -level data reflect the mother's county of residence, not the county in which the birth occurred 4 This goal of 77.9% represents a 10% increase from the average number of prenatal patients receiving prenatal care during the first trimester in 2007 5 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Women's Health.

The trend for both the state and Tuolumne County has been for decreasing teen pregnancies, however th e drop evident in Tuolumne County that occurred after 2007 coincided with a five year Title X grant that specifically addressed access to family planning for youth and that grant will not be renewed after 2013. Because there are significant correlations between ethnic groups and teen pregnancy rates, it is important to stratify the Tuolumne County teen birth rate according to the local demographic profile. In doing so, it is note d that the birth rate to mothers aged 15 to 19 years in 2010 for the state was 31.5 births per 1000 and in Tuolumne County it appears much less at 16.9 births per 1000. However, if the rate for only the White non -Hispanic population is compared between th e state and the county, the rates for Tuolumne County are actually higher than the state average, in 2010 with 15.5 births per 1000 White non -Hispanic females aged 15 to 19 in Tuolumne County, compared to an average of 10.9 per 1000 for the average Califor nia White non -Hispanic population aged 15 to 19. This suggests that use of family planning services for Tuolumne County youth is lagging slightly behind the state average. While many teen pregnancies lead to very healthy outco mes, infants of teen mothers face special challenges and statistically require greater social support than infants of mothers over age 20. 6F7 Not only do teen pregnancies have a greater rate of complications during delivery, they also tend to create disad vantages for teen parents, such as lower educational attainment and lower income levels. 7F8 7 The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.

That objective targets a breastfeeding rate for infants of 81.9% at any time. Breastfeeding, especially ea rly breastfeeding has multiple benefits. These benefits include that breast milk : Protects against allergies, sickness, and obesity Protects against diseases, like diabetes and cancer Protects against infections, like ear infections Is easily digested - less constipation, diarrhea or upset stomach Growth rates are healthier The California Department of Public Health measures breast feeding rates by using data collected by the Newborn Screening (NBS) Program and by reports from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program . The NBS protocol monitors in -hospital infant feeding practices on all infants from birth until ap proximately 24 to 48 hours after birth. The data are analyzed by the Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health Program staff and breastfeeding rates are published by hospital, county and the State (see graph) . The WIC program monitors breastfeeding rates for enrollees. In Tuolumne County between October 2012 and September 201 3 the rates of exclusive breastfeeding for WIC infants were 46.8% at 3 months and 35.2% at 6 months of age. The Healthy People 2020 objective is for at least 46.2% of mothers to exclusively breastfeed at 3 months and 25.5% to continue until their infants are 6 months of age, indicating that these objectives are being met for local WIC clients. Some reasons women do not breastfeed include non-conducive hospital practices, low milk suppl ies, short maternity leaves, misinformation about breastfed baby growth patterns, cultural beliefs and lack of community support. Additionally, lack of professional support when women experience difficulty in trying to establish breastfeeding is often cited. SB 502 was signed by the governor in October 2011, establishing the requirement that beginning in January 2014 all C alifornia general acute care hospitals have an infant feeding policy to facilitate breastfeeding and that it be communicated clearly in the perinatal units of such hospitals. Breastfeeding policies have been in place at Sonora Regional Medical Center for many years and updates are currently in process to seek \"Baby Friendly Hospital\" designation. 90.7% Amador County Calaveras County Tuolumne County Data Source: As cited on kidsdata.o rg, California Department of Public Health, Center for Family Health, Genetic Disease Screening Program, Newborn Screening Data, 2000 -2011. 9 | P a g e Childhood Immunizations Tuolumne County kindergarten immunization rates remain fairly stable at about 75%. However, this is significantly lower than the st ate's rate of about 90%. Completed immunization rates for local public schools are 79%, while completed vaccination rates for private schools reporting their rates stand at only 29%. The percentage of children reported to be fully vaccinated is the estima ted percentage of children ages 4-6 in kindergarten with all required immunizations. Immunizations are successful and cost - effective preventive methods to help millions of children avoid contracting many serious and potentially fatal infectious diseases 8F9. Children are far more likely to be seriously inju red by a vaccine -preventable disease than by the vaccine itself, particularly in an unvaccinated community.10 Current immunization schedules recommend that children and adolescents should be immunized to protect against 16 diseases. These include: polio; diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough; cervic al cancer due to papillomavirus. The children entering kindergarten without being fully immunized currently do so under several categori es, which include Conditional Entrants (students for whom vaccinations are pending but expected to be completed shortly), those classified as Permanent Medical Exemptions (students for whom a medical condition precludes vaccination ), and those with Persona l Belief Exemptions (students whose parents have a belief against vacc inations for their children). Many parents who choose not to immunize their children often believe that immunizations might be problematic for a small but significant percentage of th e recipients and have serious questions about the efficacy and necessity of the immunizations. Beginning in January 2014, a new Personal Belief Exemption form is being released by the California Department of Public Health in accordance with AB 2109, a bi ll signed in 2012 which requires that all parents choosing to forego vaccination for their children receive information about the risks and benefits of vaccination from a health care provider or school nurse. Parents may also decline vaccinations for thei r children based upon a religious exemption. 9 U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2020. (2011).

I f one views the reading proficiency from 10 years ago, an even more marked improvement is seen; in 2003 the 3rd grade reading proficiency was 36%. Third grade reading scores are highly correlate d with academic success later in life . In fact, research indicates that reading proficiency at the end of third grade may predict whether a student will graduate from high school . 10F11, 11F12 Additionally , children with limited reading abilities will often experience a more difficult time transitioning across multiple subjects . To score as proficient, a student must demonstrate a competent and adequate understanding of the knowledge and skills measured by the English Language Arts (Reading) standardized testing. The World Health Organization recognizes the critical role of literacy in health by listing Primary Education as one of the Millennium Development Goals included in the WHO Global Health Indicators list in 2012. 12F13 \"Health literacy\" relates specifically to the ability of individuals to use health information to make appropriate health decisions and is a component of health reform that holds great promise for improving the efficiency of our health care system. 13F14 11 Musen, L.

Regular physical activity has many benefits for children , which include: Increased development muscle strength and Beneficial for heart and bone health Augmented weight control Decreased risk for many chronic diseases Positive effects on mental health and education outcomes Inclination to continue healthy lifestyle into adulthood The 2012 the Tuolumne County schools significant increase in fitness may be attributable to the Fit for the Future Program. This program focuses on physical fi tness and healthy diet. The results from one school in the pilot study showed 17% of the 23 students who participated passed 5 to 6 of the fitness standards at the beginning of the year and 61 % of them passed at the end of that school year. 15 These indicators of physical fitness include the percentage of students meeting all 6 of California's fitness standar ds by 5th, 7th, and 9th grades; measured through the California Physical Fitness Test, which is administered annually to public school children in grades 5, 7, and 9. The 6 areas of fitness measured include: upper body strength, flexibility, aerobic capaci ty, body composition, abdominal strength, and trunk strength. Students must meet minimum fitness levels in each area to pass this state test.

However, approximately 30% of our children are overweight or obese. The 2007 -2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 17% of the nation's children ages 2 -19 are obese. 15F16 This rate has nearly tripled over the past three decades. Recent attention has been given to the distinction between obesity and poor physical fitness. Research has indicated that both are independent predictors of premature death and may occur independently in any given individual. 16F17 The increase in obesi ty has significant implications for the health of our children now and as they age. Obese children are at risk for a range of social and physical health problems including low self -esteem, discrimination from others, joint problems, sleep apnea, and asthm a. Obese children, along with overweight children 17F18 are also more likely to develop serious chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and are liable to remain overweight o r obese throughout their lives. The r isk factors for obesity inclu de he redity, limited exercise and physical activity at home and school, incre ased portion sizes of meals, and increased cons umption of high calorie /low nutrient (\"junk\" food) food and sugary drinks. By improving access to healthier food options and addressing various risk factors the trend towards increasing childhood obesity is beginning to level off in some communities.19 16 defined as having a Body Mass Index, BMI, at or above the 95th percentile for age and gender per the 2000 CDC g rowth charts 17 Frank, B et al, Adiposity as Compared with Physical Activity in Predicting Mortality Among Women , New England Journal of Medicine, December 13, 2004 351;26 2694 -2703 18 defined as having a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile for age an d gender per the 2000 CDC growth charts 19 F as in Fat: How Obesity Threatens America Trust for America 's Health and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , August 2013 Overweight and Obese Students by County: 2006 - 2010 Region Percent 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 California kidsdata.org, S.

Typically, as the public becomes more aware of child maltreatment and how to report it, the rate of reports goes up. The number of reported cases may vary greatly depending upon cultural norms , economic status , and the data may be influenced by the vitalit y of the reporting, investigation and prosecutorial system. Research shows that in 30% to 60% of homes with either domestic violence or child abuse cases, it is likely that both types of abuse are occurring.\" Children who are abused and neglected often will develop emotional, behavioral, and addiction problems, and have difficulty in social setting and in doing well in school. They can also exhib it health problems, and may repeat the cycle of abuse and neglect they experienced. Tuolumne County Child Welfare Services has identified that much of the increase in the substantiated neglect or abuse case rate in Tuolumne County is accounted for by a v ery high rate of re -entry into the system. The population accounting for this high rate of recidivism was identified as a group with very high substance abuse rates. A recently awarded grant will focus attention upon this particular population. 20 A child is counted only once (per year, per county). 13.3 15.6 14.5 19.8 17.2 0.05.010.015.020.025.0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Rate of substantiated child abuse and neglect cases per 1,000 children under age 18 California Tuolumne County Source: As cited on kidsdata.org, Needell, B ., et al.

Tuolumne County students in \"non-traditional schools \" exhibited higher frequency of use than those in traditional schools (see definitions below) . About 10% of seventh grade students reported using drugs or alcohol once in the past month and 6% reported using drugs for 20 days or more in the past month. This was not substantially different than 11th grade students' usage, but was higher than other foothill counties. Youth alcohol and/or drug use can be linked to risky health behaviors such as unprotected sex, as well as poor academic performance, physical and/or datin g violence, motor vehicle accidents, crime, overdose and suicide attempts. 20F22 Definition: Percentage of public school students in grades 7, 9, and 11 reporting the number of days in which they used alcohol or any illegal drug (excluding tobacco) in the past 30 days.

Largely due to the success of interventions like vaccination, improved community water and sewage systems and antibiotics, people are living almost 70% longer than 100 years ago giving the diseases of aging an opportunity to impact the general population. Approximately 75% of the 2.7 trillion dollars spent on health care in this country each year is spent on the management of chronic disease , yet only 4% of public health funds are provided for the prevention and improved care of chronic disease. 21F23 This mismatch is changing. Not only have new insights regarding the effectiveness of preventive practices against the onslaught of chronic illness inspired optimism that not all diseases of ag ing are inevitable, but evidence indicates that improvements to quality of life also follow from preventive practices and result in a more efficient and productive work force. This section of the Community Health Assessment will investigate how well the Tuolumne County population is engaging with the local health care community to make the most effective use of the health care resources available and how well the local population adheres to the preventive practices that have proven to be effective in promo ting wellness and managing chronic conditions. Indicators Categories of chronic illness that were identified for measurement included General Health, Nutrition and Fitness, Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Preventive and Early Detection Services and Mental and Behavioral Health. For most of these categories, it was determined that the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations would be used as a foundation for evidence -based practice, supplemented by the guidelines of other expert groups such as the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and the specialty boards of various medical disciplines. The Let's Get Healthy California Task Force indicators provided an initial list of proposed indicators for consideratio n. Findings Tuolumne County faces a special burden of chronic diseases and disability due to the larger elderly population. However, a particular population at risk of a poor sense of wellness, a higher rate of suicide and a higher rate of overdose death is the age 45 to 55 years cohort . Substance abuse is a major contributor to chronic illness in Tuolumne County, including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption and abuse of prescription pain relievers. Significant health disparity exists locally for certain ethnic groups and for the population living in povert y. 23 The Burden of Chronic Disease and Injury, 2013 California Department of Public Health, Center for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2013 Chronic Disease Hospitalization Rates Health Status Dietary Habits Weight - Adults Physical Activity Smoking Excessive Drinking Diabetes High Blood Pressure Mammography Suicide Overdose Deaths 16 | P a g e Chronic Disease Rates The rates of most of the major chronic diseases in Tuolumne County are similar to those seen on average in California. The following details explain some of the findings in the rates of chronic disease reported below: The much h igher rate of arthritis in Tuolumne County disappears when we look only at the population under 50 years of age. This suggests that the higher rate of arthritis and other joint diseases (Gout, Lupus and Fibromyalgia) in Tuolumne County may be largely expl ained by the higher percentage of Tuolumne County residents who are seniors. A comparison between the higher self -reported rate of asthma in Tuolumne County and the lower hospitalization rate for asthma in Tuolumne County 22F24 suggests that local asthma management is effective in preventing hospitalizations. According to data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, local residents 5 to 17 years of age have essentially the same rate of Emergency Departmen t visits for asthma as the state average. While Tuolumne County shows a lower rate of diabetes than the state average, the rate for the white population is about the same as the rate for the average California white population, suggesting that the lower ov erall rate of diabetes in Tuolumne County is mostly explained by the higher risk of diabetes in the non -white, non -Hispanic population and the fact that the Tuolumne County population has a lower non -white, non -Hispanic population than other parts of Calif ornia . As a nation, 75% of our health care dollars go to the treatment of chronic diseases. 23F25 These persistent conditions \u2014 the nation's leading causes of death and disability \u2014contribute to lifelong disability, compromised quality of life, and burgeoning health care costs. Leading a healthy lifestyle can greatly reduce a person's risk for developing chronic disease. Access to high -quality and affordable prevention measures are essential steps in saving lives, reducing disability and lowering costs for med ical care. 24F26 24 2009 Office of Statewide Health and Development Hospitalizations Due to Asthma by County, All Races, All Ages, Both Genders 25 CCLHO -CHEAC Chronic Disease Pre vention Leadership Project , Chronic Disease Prevention Framework , March 2013 26 Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, The Burden of Chronic Disease , California Department of Public (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2009 data)Ever Been Diagnosed with Arthritis, Gout, Lupus or Fibromyalgia (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2011-12 data)Asthma Diagnosis for 18 years and older (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2009 data)Hypertension (Hospital Discharges by National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Program)Congestive Heart Failure (Hospital Discharges by National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Program)Diabetes Prevelance (CDC National Diabetes Surveillance System)Tuolumne County and California Chronic Disease Rates Tuolumne California17 | P a g e Health Status - Self-Assessment The Area Agency on Aging 2011 survey of seniors in Tuolumne and other foothill counties indicated that 50 to 54 year olds reported the lowest rates of \"happiness\" of 50 to 85 plus year old cohorts. In the 50 to 54 year old cohort, only 50% reported being \"happy\" while of those who were 65 years and older at least 66% reported \"I am happy.\" One of the first considerations regarding the wellness of a population is their own self -perception of their health. In order to strive for wellness it is important th at a certain degree of expectation exist that good health is within reach. Therefore, the Tuolumne County population's own self perception of their health level is an important target for analysis. In the 2011 -2012 California Health Interview Survey, thos e queried responded to the question: \"In general, would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor? 25F27 To assure that the information is collected from enough people to be statistically significant, the data are collected from the r egion consisting of Tuolumne, Calaveras, Amador, Inyo, Mariposa, Mono and Alpine Counties. In general, the region reported slightly better health status compared to the state. 27 California Health Interview Survey, UC LA, 2011 to 2012 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Tuolumne CountyCalifornia0-18 Years Poor Fair up Self-Assessment of Health by Age Group in Tuolumne County and California Source: 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey 18 | P a g e Source: 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey Dietary Habits Diet plays a critical role in the prevention and management of a number of the most devastating chronic health conditions. Several healthy nutritional choices are highlighted to portray the dietary habits of local residents. Fruits and Vegetables Children ages 2 to 11 years in our region (Tuolumne, Calaveras, Amador, Inyo, Mariposa, Mono, Alpine Counties) consume fewer servings of fruits and vegetables than their counterparts in the state. The Centers for Disease Control indicates that healthy diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. Addition ally, fruits and vegetables also provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health. Fast Food Consumption Local residents in our geographic region report a lower frequency of fast food consumption than that of the state. However, at least two -thirds of our residents eat fast food one or more times per week; and about 25% report eating fast food two or more times weekly. In this survey, residents were asked to include fast food meals eaten at work or sc hool, at home, or at fast food restaurants, carryout or drive thru. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 26F28 established by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture encourage Americans to focus on eating foods and drinking beverages that help achieve and maintain a healthy weight, promote wellness, and prevent disease. In general, fast food does not meet these criteria, and the more calories a person consumes from fast food restaurants the greater is their consumption of fat, salt and sugar and the fewer calories they get from foods higher in nutrients, like fruit, vegetables and grains. Thi s can lead to weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Young adults who eat frequently at fast -food restaurants gain more weight and have a greater increase in insulin resistance in early middle age, according to a 28 www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0%100.0% Percent of children consuming at least 5 fruits and vegetables dailyPercent of population limiting Fast Foods to once or not at all in the past weekPercent of population limiting consumption of sugary drinks to once or not at all in the past 24 hoursPercent of the Population Practicing a Healthier Diet Tuolumne County and California Tuolumne County and foothills region California19 | P a g e large multi -cent er study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), contributing to a higher risk of diabetes. 27F29 Consumption of Sugary Drinks The children and teen respondents in our region reported consuming approximately the same amount of soda or sugary drinks as their counterparts throughout the state, although it should be noted that the regional numbers were statically unstable. To gather the data, respondents were asked: \"Yesterday, how many glasses or cans of soda, such as Coke, or other sweetened drinks, such as fruit punch or sport drinks did {you/he/she} drink? Do not count diet drinks.\" This was asked of children 2 years or older and all adolescents. Children were queried through their parents. 29 Pereira, MA et al, Fast -Food Habits, weight gain, and insulin resistance (the CARDIA study): 15 year prospective analysis, The Lancet, Vol. 365 No.9453 pp36 -42 January 1 , 2005 20 | P a g e Weight - Adults While the percent of the population in the Tuolumne, Calaveras, Amador, Alpine, Mariposa, Inyo and Mono County region with a body weight above the normal range is about the same as the percent of the general population in California (56.7% for the Sierra counties co mpared to 59.8% for California), a higher percent of the California population falls in the obese range 28F30 (24.8%) than the local population (18.7%). Measurements for overweight and obesity rely upon the Body Mass Index (BMI) which is calculated by divi ding weight (in kilograms) by height squared (in meters). The CDC states that obesity and inactive lifestyles contribute to heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, 29F31 and are estimated to be a factor in over 15% of all deaths in the U.S. 30F32 Obesity trends statewide tend to show higher rates of obesity and overweight for lower income groups . However, in the Tuolumne County region 31F33 families with incomes over 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) tend to have higher overweight and obesity rates. Additionally, the CDC 32F34 relates that : Among non -Hispanic African -American and Mexican -American men, those with higher incomes are more likely to be obese than those with low income. Higher income women are less likely to be obese than low -income women. There is no significant relationship between obesity and education among men. Among women, however, there is a trend \u2014those with college degrees are less likely to be obese compared with less educated women. 30 Overweight in adults is defined as a Body Mass Index over 25, and Obesity in adults is defined as a Body Mass Index over 30 31 Polednak AP.

Of these, 77.5 percent drove to work alone while 11.3 percent carpooled. Almost 1 percent of all workers reported that they used some form of public transportation, while 3.9 percent bicycled or walked to work.

However, in 2010, the county youth showed a lower rate than the state. The smoking rate may actually be even higher than reported by the California County and Statewide Archive of Tobacco Statistics (C -STATS) data . A professional 2012 telephone survey of 420 Tuolumne County homes was conducted under the Community Transformat ion Initiative in coordination with the Public Health Institute with a margin of sampling error +/ - 4.9% . This survey indicates a current adult cigarette smoking rate in Tuolumne County of 26% with 35% of households having at least one cigarette smoker and nearly 49% of households including at least one tobacco consumer using either smokeless tobacco, cigarettes, cigars and/or pipes . Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body.36 The adverse health effects from cigarette smoking account for more than 440,000 deaths, or nearly one of every five deaths, each year in the United States. More deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illeg al drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders combined. Smoking rates are higher for patients receiving mental health services. Compared with nonsmokers, smoking is estimated to increase the risk of: Coronary heart disease by 2 to 4 times and stroke by 2 to 4 times Men developing lung cancer by 23 times Women developing lung cancer by 13 times Dying from chronic obstructive lung diseases (such as chronic bronchitis and emphyse ma) by 12 to 13 times 36 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

University of Wisconsin Population Healthy Institute's Rankings and Roadmaps states that \"excessive drinking reflects the percent of adults that report either binge drinking, defined as consuming more than 4 (women) or 5 (men) alcoholic beverages on a single occasion in the past 30 days, or heavy drinking, defined as drinking more than one (women) or 2 (men) drinks per day on average. Excessive drinking is a risk factor for a number of adverse health outcomes such as alcohol poisoning, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, suicide, interpersonal violence, and motor vehicle crashes. Approxi mately 80,000 deaths are attributed annually to excessive drinking. 35F37 Excessive drinking is the third leading lifestyle -related cause of death in the United States. \" Notes: A study evaluating the reliability and validity of the self -reported Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) measures found the reliability (repeatability) of the BRFSS alcohol consumption data to be high. Validity (accurate representation) wa s found to be moderate but sufficient given the difficulty in assessing the validi ty of people's reports of their own alcohol use. 36F38 Using self -reported survey data to assess excessive drinking has limitations. First, excessive drinking is often underreported in surveys because of recall bias, social desirability response bias, and no n-response bias. Second, BRFSS changed the definition of excessive drinking for women in 2006; this means that there will be a higher prevalence in recent years compared to prior yea rs for women. 37F39 Third, the measure does not include youth drinking prev alence. Some US states and counties administer a Youth Behavioral Risk Surveillance Survey, but there is not adequate coverage or consistent enough methodology to aggregate the res ults to represent all counties across the country. 38F40 Binge drinking accoun ts for 90% of alcohol consumption for youth ages 12 -17. Having a measure that includes youth binge drinking would be beneficial for understanding youth drinking patterns in differen t counties. 39F41 37 Mokdad, AH et. al., Actual causes of death in the U.S. JAMA 2004, March 10;291(10):1238 - 38 Nelson DE, Holtzman D, Bolen J, Stanwyck CA, Mack KA.

County Health Rankings 2013 24 | P a g e Diabetes When asked \"Other than during pregnancy, had/has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes,\" the region's adults responded with relatively the same prevalence of diabetes (also known as diabetes mellitus ) as that of the state. However, the disparity in genetic risk for Type 2 diabetes is evident when the regional population is stratified according to race and ethnicity. The highest risk for diabetes is seen in residents with African American and American Indian/Pacific Islander heritage. Surveillance data from 2013 indicates that the Tuolumne Me Wuk people have a 10.2% prevalence of diabetes . Other risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, prior history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and physical inactivity. Risk factors are less well defined for Type 1 diabetes (previously called \" insulin -dependent diabetes\") than for Type 2 diabetes, but research indicat es that autoimmune, environmental factors and, to a lesser extent, genetic factors are involved in develop ing Type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. It is a disease in which blood glucose levels are above normal. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower -extremity amputations. 40F42 42 Centers for Mariposa, Mono, Alpine California Source: 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey = Confidence intervals 25 | P a g e High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Prevalence When compared to the state, the region showed about the same prevalence of high blood pressure. Similar to the risks of diabetes, however, the risks of hypertension are greater for certain ethnic and racial groups. African American and Latino populations have a higher prevalence of high blood pressure than whites . 41F43 Because Tuolumne County and other Sierra counties are predominantly white, this differential risk is not apparent until the prevalence of high blood pressure in the r acial groups is separately identified. The region's African American population is less than 2.0% compared to the state's African American population of 6.6%. Because this small local population leads to sampling limitations in the California Health Interview Survey, the confidence intervals for the Sierra counties are wide. Neverthel ess, the intervals for the rates of hypertension in the local African American and Latino populations overlap the intervals for the state and are therefore consistent with statewide trends which show slig htly higher rates of hypertension in African America ns and Latinos compared to the white population. The region's adults were asked: \"Has a doctor ever told you that you have high blood pressure?\" Respondents with borderline high blood pressure/hypertension were not considered diagnosed with high blood pressure. About 1 in 3 U.S. adults \u2014an estimated 68 million \u2014have high blood pressure, which increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, two leading causes of death in the United States. 42F44 43 Keenan NL, Rosendorf KA.

In addition to this serving as a measure of the prevalence of hypertension, the percent of the population receiving medication for their high blood pressure is a measure of access to medical and pharmaceutical services and a measure of what is called \"health literacy.\" \"Health Literacy\" is defined by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as \"the degree to which an individual has the capacity to obtain, communicate, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.\" 43F45 The following question was asked of adults who have ever been told by a doctor that they have high blood pressure: \"Are you now taking any medications to control your high blood pressure?\" The data were filtered for different socioeconomic levels in order to clarify any correlation between financial status and receipt of blood pressure control medication. High blood pressure is called the \"silent killer\" because it often has no warning signs or symptoms, and many people don't realize they have it. It is therefore recommended that people get their blood pressu re checked regularly and, if found to be hypertensive, to take appropriate action. This action may include taking medication for the condition. As can be seen from the graph, Tuolumne County residents take blood pressure medications for their hypertensio n slightly more often than people in other parts of California. In addition, a correlation does indeed exist between lower economic status and failure to take blood pressure medication with considerably fewer local residents of low income taking blood pre ssure medications. 45 Title V, Section 5002, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 , Public Law 111 -148 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0%90.0% 0-133% FPL 133-250% FPL 251-400% FPL over 400% FPL Household income by percent of Federal Poverty Level Percent Population Taking Medication for Hypertension by Economic Status, Tuolumne County Region and California Tuolumne County Region California Source: 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey = Confidence intervals 27 | P a g e Mammography Women in the Tuolumne County region exhibited a greater tendency to have a repeat mammogram earlier than women throughout the state. In 2009 the United States Preventive Services Task Force released Grade B recommendations for mammography to begin for the general population of women at age 50, and then to follow with screening mammography every other year until age 74. The decision to start mammographic screening earlier than age 50 is to be based upon individualized considerations for each patient. To assess the degree of adherence to these recommendations, women 30 years old and older were asked, \"Have you ever had a mammogram?\" Additionally, if they answered yes, they were asked \"How long ago did you have your most recent mammogram?\" Aside from non-melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States. It is also one of the leading causes of cancer death among women of all races. In 2010, the incidence rate of breast cancer in Tuolumne and Mariposa Counti es was 131 per 100,000 women. 44F46 The rate during that same year for a similar demographic population in California was 137 per 100,000 women, establishing that the rate of new breast cancer diagnoses in Tuolumne and Mariposa Counties in 2010 was about ave rage for the state. While between 2008 and 2010 breast cancer represented the second most common cause of death due to cancer for women in Tuolumne County (with an age -adjusted mortality rate of 17 per 100,000), this mortality rate was one of the lowe st for the state . 46 California Cancer Registry, http://www.cancer -rates.info/ca/index.php , In the California Cancer Registry, Tuolumne County data is combined with Mariposa County data 75.90 10.80 13.20 65.6 11.5 22.9 01020304050607080 < 2 Y E A R S A G O > 2 Y E A R S A G O N E V E R M A M M O G R A P H S C R E E N I N G H I S T O R Y S H O W N I N P E R C E N T A G E S ( A L L P O P U L A T I O N S ) Region State Source: 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey 28 | P a g e Suici de Tuolumne County suffers one of the highest rates of su icide in the state. M any characteristics of the Sierra counties are recognized features that correlate with high suicide rates, such as high substance abuse rates, rurality, availability of firearms and a predominately white and Native American population. 45F47 As seen in the graph to the right, the rate of suicide in Tuolumne County is significantly higher than the state . As is true across the United States, local data indicates that the highest rates of suicide occur in two age groups - the 40 to 49 year old age group and the over 70 age group. While suicidal behavior is seen in females almost three times as often as in males, the mortality rate from suicide is nearly four times higher in males. The signs that a person is cont emplating suicide may not be easy to recognize. Some health conditions may place a person at particular risk, but studies indicate that the most promising way to prevent suicide and suicidal behavior is through socialization and access to trained personne l to address the needs of people at risk of suicide and/or in crisi s.48 47 Stolp, S and Stolp,C , Social Variables and Suicide Risk in Rural California Counties, May 2009 48 California Stra tegic Plan on Suicide Prevention: Every Californian Is Part of the Solution , California Dept of Mental Health, June 30, 2008 Source: Tuolumne County Health Department, 2013 Source: Tuolumne County Health Department 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.0 1996 1999 2001 2003 2009 Tuolumne County/100,000 - 49 yrs50 - 59 yrs60 - 69 yrs70 - 79 yrs>80 yrsTuolumne County Suicide Rates by Age & Gender 1990 - 2012; Fatality Rate per 100,000 in age group Male Female29 | P a g e Source: Tuolumne County Department of Public Health Source: Tuolumne County Department of Public Health Overdose deaths Between 1991 and 2008 the overdose death rate in the United States increased by three fold. 47F49 In 2008, the overdose death rate in the U.S. was 11.9 per 100,000 people. Risk factors for overdose death include rural communities, White non - Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status and use of prescription opiates. The peak age for overdose de ath is 45 to 54 both in Tuolumne County and across the United States. These deaths occurred almost equally between males and females in Tuolumne County, but nationally there is a preponderance of overdoses among males . Between 1999 and 2010, the sales of opiate pain relievers quadrupled in the U.S. and in Tuolumne County. 48F50 In response to the recognition that a national epidemic of prescription medication addiction and overdose was underway, an ad hoc committee was convened and developed the Tuolumne County Prescription Security and Pain Management Guidelines which were then endorsed by the Tuolumne County Medical Society in September of 2011. 49 Overdoses of Prescription Opioid Pain Relievers, MMWR, US, 1999 -2008, Nov. 4, 2011/60(43);1487 -1492 50 California D epartment of Ju stice CURES Data , 2005 05101520253035 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007Overdose Deaths per 100,000 Year Tuolumne County Overdose Death Rate by Year, Total Overdose Deaths by Age, Tuolumne County, 2007 -2012 Male Female30 | P a g e END OF LIFE Maintaining Dignity and Independence We recognize that end -of-life is one of the most critical and difficult stages of life and, yet, we know that knowledge of choices and availability of resources and care is in need of attention. Our goal was to establish a baseline of how the county is d oing in meeting these end -of-life need. How we care for individuals at the end of life is a critical measure of the overall health and strength of a community. There is typically no distinct transition into the phase we call \"end -of-life,\" yet the priori ties during this time often contrast sharply with values that are prominent during earlier stages of life. As a result, it is common for people to feel unprepared. Providing resources and education to help people make the inevitable social, financial and healthcare adjustments that are necessary at the end of life is critical to the comfort and security of a community . Indicators The End -of-Life indicators include Hospice Care from the state indicators list. We also selected Age and C auses of D eath as indicators . As measures of the needs of seniors, we also included Falls , Longevity and Access to Skilled Nursing and Assisted Living facilities. Findings We found that our seniors face many challenges and that they also have many resources to help them ad dress these challenges. Most significantly, in Tuolumne County, both men and women are living longer , with the two leading causes of death in the county being heart disease and cancer. Our r esidents over 65 years old in Tuolumne County and neighboring ru ral counties report falls almost 37% more than their age group in other areas of the state. Furthermore, a ccessibility to skilled nursing and assisted living units varies depending upon the census of the different facilities. Data reflects an increase in hospice accessibility and usage , but late entry of patients into the Hospice program limits the benefits that can be delivered . Falls Skilled Nursing and Assisted Living Access Hospice Longevity Age and Cause of Death 31 | P a g e Source: 2011 - 2012 Californi a Health Interview Survey Falls Residents in the region (Tuolumne, Calaveras, Amador, Inyo, Mariposa, Mono, and Alpine Counties) reported falling almost 37% more than their others in their age cohort in the state. The CDC reports that \"Each year, one in every three adults age 65 and older falls. Falls can cause moderate to severe injuries, such as hip fractures and head injuries, and can increase the risk of early death. Fortunately, falls are a public health problem that is largely preventable.\" How big is the problem? One out of three adults age 65 and older falls each year; 49F51 but less than half talk to their healthcare providers about it. Among older adults (those 65 or older), falls are the leading cause of injury death. They are also the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma and In 2010, 2.3 million nonfatal fall injuries among older adults were treated in emergency departments and more than 662,000 of these patients were hospitalized 50F52 51F53 Twenty to thirty percent of people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries such as lacerations, hip fractures, or head traumas. These injuries can make it hard to get around or live independently, and increase the risk of early death. 52F54 Falls are the most co mmon cause of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). 53F55 51 Hausdorff JM, Rios DA, Edelber HK. and fall risk in community -living older adults: a 1 -year prospective study.

Together they offer 290 skilled nursing beds and 259 assisted living beds . 54F56 Of these 59 are designated for memory care. When accounting for the number of residents 65 years old and older, Amador County has more assisted living beds per one thousand 65+ year olds, and fewer skilled nursing beds. Calaveras County has si gnificantly fewer of both types of care for their elder citizens. Wait times to enter these facilities varies greatly depending upon census. Independent living communities are considered to be any form of housing that is targeted to seniors over the age of 55. Residents maintain as much independence as possible and are still able to perform all of the activities of daily living. Assisted living residents are usually seniors who have had a slight decline in health in some way and need assistance performing one or more activities of daily living. Statistically, the most common resident of an assisted living community is a female in her mid -eightie s. Skilled nursing facilities (often referred to as Nursing Homes) are generally for older adults who require 24- hours licensed medical care at a much higher level than those who reside in an assisted living community. 55F57 The Medicare and/or Medicai d-certified nursing home must have at least one licensed Registered Nurse (RN) for at least 8 hours per day, 7 days a week, and other nursing staff, such as an RN or Licensed Practical Nurse/Licensed Vocational Nurse (LPN/LVN), on duty 24 hours per day. Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) are generally on staff 24 hours per day. They work under the supervision of a licensed nurse to help residents with daily activities, such as eating, bathing, and dressing . 56F58 56 Avalon, SRMC, Skyline, Casa Viejo, Meadow View Manor, Country Lane E states, Oak Terrace 57 Assisted Living Info ; assistedliving.com 58 Medicare.gov - Medicare Coverage of Skilled Nursing Care Booklet 23.9 6.6 21.80 Amador Calaveras Tuolumne2013 Assisted Living beds per 1,000 65+ year old residents 23.4 9.5 24.4 Amador Calaveras Tuolumne2013 Skilled Nursing Facility beds per 1,000 65+ year old residents Source: Area 12 Agency on Aging and Local Survey Source: Area 12 Agency on Aging and Local Survey 33 | P a g e Hospice More than 200 people each year are admitted to Tuolumne County Hospice care. The average monthly admissions have been increasing since 2010, and thus the total visits are also increasing. Hospice care provides medical services, emotional support, and spiritual resources for people who are in the last stages of a serious illness, such as cancer or heart failure. Most often these services are offered at home or in a home -like setting. Hosp ice care also helps family members manage the practical details and emotional challenges of caring for a dying loved one. Commonly, the 24 -hour a day services are provided by a team of highly trained and compassionate professionals including physicians, nurses, home health aides, social workers, spiritual counselors, and volunteers. 57F59 Hospice experts often recommend that patients are in Hospice care for at least a month, and preferably 6 months. This avails the patient and the family optimum access t o the f ull benefit of hospice services. 58F60 59 Quill, T et al Dying and Decision Making - Evolution of End of Life Options New Eng J of Med, 350:20 2029 -31May 2004 60 Morrison, S et al Palliative Care , New Eng J of Med, 350:25 2582 -90 June 27, 2004 Hospice Statistics 2010 2011 2012 2013 * Total Admissions 218 231 277 213 Average Monthly Admissions 18 19 23 27 Average Day on Census 35 33 38 37 Average Census 23 19 30 34 Total Visits 4,374 6,657 7,937 6,332 Source: Sonora Regional Medical Center *Data through August 2013 Source for all data : Sonora Regional Medical Center 69 11 81 9 0 20 40 60 80 100Less than 1 week1 week to 1 month1 month to 6 months6 months to 1 yearTuolumne County 2012 Number of Patients and Length of Stay in Hospice Care Source: Sonora Regional Medical Center 34 | P a g e Longevity In Tuolumne County, both men and women are living longer . Life expectancy for a newborn in Tuolumne County in 2010 is 81.3 years for a female and 78.1 years for a male. 59F61 However, since the mid 1980's women's length of life has not increased as significantly as men's. This is true statewide and nationwide as well. Although United States citizens are living longer and the U.S. spends t he most on health care of any country in the world ($8,400 per capita) , it ranks behind thirty other countries when i t comes to life expectancy . 60F62 61 Life Expectancy, Health Metrics and Evaluation at University of Washington and Henry J Kaiser Foundation , http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/tools/ accessed September 2013 62 ABC News and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington 7072747678808284 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008Longevity - Tuolumne County and State County Men State Men County Women State Women Source: In stitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington 35 | P a g e Source: California Department of Public Health Age and Cause of Death Although men and women are living longer, it is also important to realize that in the cumulative years of 2008 through 2010, almost 25% of the 1,764 Tuolumne County residents who died did so prior to reaching 65 years old. Of all deaths, many were related to modifiable risk factors, like tobacco or other substance abuse and poor physical fitness. The two leading causes of de ath in both Tuolumne County and in California are cancer and heart attacks. Both Tuolumne County and the state have seen significant decreases in both causes over the past ten years, more for heart attacks than cancer. Much of this improvement has been a ttributable to decreases in tobacco use and improvements in cholesterol and blood pressure control. 61F63 While cancer -related fatalities significantly outnumber deaths due to heart attacks, if other forms of heart disease are included (congestive heart fa ilure, valvular h eart disease etc...), then the fatality rates for these two causes are essentially equal. The lower rate of heart attack deaths in Tuolumne County compared to California depicted in the graph below is largely explained by the higher rate of heart attack deaths in non -White populations, because these groups make up a smaller portion of the Tuolumne County population than of the California population. In the graph, the high rate of motor vehicle fatalities has been attributed to winding mount ain roads and the high volume of tourists unfamiliar with local driving. The decrease in motor vehicle fatalities over the past ten years is a very positive trend. This decrease in motor vehicle fatalities has been explained by California Highway Patrol representatives as possibly resulting from increased patrols and programs targeting drunk driving. Cancer incidence and fatality rates are higher for the White non -Hispanic population, such that the rates in Tuolumne County and other predominantly white counties are somewhat higher. The high Accidents fatality rate includes motor vehicle accidents and overdoses, but also are due to occupational and recreational deaths. 63 Vital Signs: Avoidable Deaths from Heart Disease, Stroke and Hypertensive Disease, MMWR, Centers for Disease Control, September 6, 2013 62(35);721 -727 Cancer Fatality Rates: White n on- Hispanics (CI) Cancer Fatality Rates: Total Population(CI) California 171 (170 -172) 160 (159 -160) Tuolumne and Mariposa Counties 169 (158 -182) 165 (155 -177) Calaveras and Amador Counties 164 (153 -175) 162 (152 -172) Source: California Department of Public Health 36 | P a g e REDESIGNING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Efficient, Safe, and Patient Centered People who use health care services for preventative and maintenance care are better able to avoid life threatening and disabling conditions. They will choose to get that preventative care if they deem the services to be justified and if the services are easy to access, patient centered and affordable. Indicators The 2012 \"Let's Get Healthy California Task Force Report\" identified indicators which can be used to measure Tuolumne County's success in these areas. Our sub -committee chose those indicators that reflected our community and for which there were dir ectly identifiable data sources. Findings Patient satisfaction surveys conducted by the local hospital facility, Sonora Regional Medical Center (SRMC), indicate that the hospital patients think that their practitioners help them with referrals to other providers as needed. Based upon the collect ed data in this report, emergency department patients in Tuolumne County are initially seen in a timely manner, although total emergency department time is lengthy in comparison to statewide averages. Locally hospitalized patients have a favorably low rate of Hospital All -Cause Readmissions. Preventable Hospital Admissions for asthma and long term diabetes complications are favorable. Improvement is needed in the areas of Healthcare Acquired Infections, and admissions due to short -term diabetes complicat ions and bacterial pneumonia. Outpatient waiting times to see specialists are lengthy for those with private pay insurance and especially for those with Medi -Cal. This is a baseline document to be used as a measurement tool in future years to assess change s in each indicator. Tremendous effort is exerted within hospital systems in accordance with quality improvement processes that are required components of the U.S. health c are system. It should be a goal to inform consumers as well as medical profession als about the value of improved performance in this area. Wait Times Patient to Physician Ratio Emergency Response Preventable Hospitalizations Hospital All -Cause Readmissions Healthcare Associated Infections 37 | P a g e Wait T imes Emergency Departments No pattern is apparent for local versus state or national Emergency Department ( ED) wait times. One of the most obvious differences is with Sonora Regional Medical Center's short wait time to be seen by a healthcare professional ; however , local ED patients also have the longest wait times prior to being sent to their room or being sent home. Timely and effective care in hospital emergency departments is essential for good patient outcomes. Delays before receiving care in the emergency department ca n reduce the quality of care and increase risks and discomfort for patients with seriou s illnesses or injuries. Wait times at different hospitals can vary widely, depending on the number of patients seen, staffing levels, efficiency, admitting procedures, or the availability of inpatient beds. The measures of timely and effective care apply to any adult patients treated at hospitals participating in the Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) and Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Programs for whom the recommen ded treatments would be appropriate, including Medicare patients, Medicare managed care patients, and non -Medicare patients.

The time to see a specialty doctor is significantly longer , especially for those patients with MediCal as their primary insurer. This wait puts a burden not only on the patient, but on the entire system. Patients who cannot wait that long will visit urgent care clinics or the emergency department for what woul d normally be a primary care visit. Those who require specialty care will often leave the area to receive care more quickly. Some patients may simply wait, which may impact their health negatively; others may give up. As fewer primary care physicians enter the field, and fewer are interested in rural practice, one would expect the waits to increase. Affiliated health professionals, such as Nurse Practitioners, Physicians Assistants and new models utilizing paramedics and lay community health workers are being expanded and explored to address the anticipated need. 2 3.5 6 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 12MEDICAID FAMILY PRACTICE PRIMARY CARE PRIVATE SPECIALTY DOCTORS MEDICAID SPECIALTY CLINIC Wait for First Visit to be seen in Weeks Source: Local survey 39 | P a g e Physician -to-Patient Ratio Tuolumne Count y has a primary care physician -to-patient s ratio slightly lo wer than the national benchmark.

County Health Rankings 2013 and local data 40 | P a g e Emergency Response Most of the 911 emergency medical service calls are for \"medical\" reasons. The \"medical\" category includes allergic reactions, diabetic issues, high or low blood pressure (not associated with neurological, cardiac or trauma issues), nausea/vomiting and no n- traumatic abdominal pain, non -cardiac and non - traumatic chest pain, overdoses and any other undefined medi cal complaints. Basic Life Support (BLS) is an emergency procedure performed to sustain life that includes cardiopulmonary resusci tation, control of bleeding, treatment of shock, stabilization of injuries and wounds, defibrillation and first aid. Most Emergency Medical Services calls are for \"advanced life support \" (ALS) reasons. ALS includes all BLS services plus additional emergency medical car e for sustainin g life, including airway management, and drugs and medications. Programs are in place for transport of specific patients directly to higher level of care facilities based upon certain trauma criteria or for certain cardiac conditions. As population density decreases, the response time increases from about 7 minutes to 32 minutes. As expected, wilderness locations require the most time to access the patient.

However, hospitalization rates for complications of long -term diabetes, such as for amputatio ns and kidney failure, were lower for all 7 years reported. Hospitalization rates for heart failure and asthma in younger adults were also below the statewide average. Bacterial pneumonia hospitalization rates were higher in Tuolumne County. Monitorin g hospitalization rates for certain health conditions that normally respond well to outpatient health care, termed \"preventable hospitalizations,\" can provide an excellent way to assess a community's access and appropriate utilization of local health care resources. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has developed four types of Quality Indicators (QIs) that make use of hospital inpatient discharge data to measure healthcare quality. Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) identify hospital admissions that evidence suggests may have been avoided through access to and utilization of high -quality outpatient care. These measures assess the quality of the healthcare system as a whole, especially ambulatory or outpatient care, in prevent ing hospitalizations due to potentially -avoidable medical complications. Health conditions that are often amenable to outpatient control include diabetes, congestive heart failure, asthma and bacterial pneumonia.

The 30-Day Readmission Rate is the percent of patients who have had a recent hospital stay who need to go back into any hospital within 30 days of their discharge. Another measure looks at the percent of patients who are readmitted who return to the same hospital from which they were recently discharged. Medicare.gov [Hospital Compare] states that \"Patients who are admitted to the hospital for treatment of medical problems sometimes get other serious injuries, complications, or conditions, and may even die. Some patients may experience problems soon after they are discharged and need to be readmitted to the hospital. These events can often be prevented if hospitals follow best practices for treating patients. Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed care plans are not included in the readmission data measures. Readmission measures also do not include patients who transferred to another hospital for a higher level of care, or who left the hospital against medica l advice. Calculation of the 30 -day readmission measures adjust for patient characteristics that may make death or readmission more likely, even if the hospital provided quality care \u2014including the patient's age, gender, past medical history, and other dis eases or conditions (comorbidities) the patient had when they were admitted that are known to increase the patient's risk of dying or readmission.\" Another measure of efficient use of health care resources is reflected in the degree to which Emergency De partment services are utilized for chronic disease care . In 2013 an assessment of Emergency Department u tilization was conducted by Sonora Regional Medical Center, identifying 23 patients who accounted for 307 visits to the Emergency Department over a six month period, between September 2012 and February 2013. The chart depicts the most frequent primary complaints of these patients. 9/30/2012 30-Day Readmit Rate Percentage of 30-Day Readmits to the same hospital Source: Health Services Advisory Group 43 | P a g e Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) Sonora Regional Medical Center showed a slightly higher rate for some healthcare associated infections (Intensive Care Unit CLABSI, Medical/Surgical Unit CLABSI and VRE BSI) than the state rate. Definitions for the acronyms describing these infections are included below. Other healthcare associated infections, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections occurred at rates below the state average. Healthcare -associated infections (HAIs) are infections that patients develop during the course of receiving healthcare treatment for other conditions. They can be caused by a wide variety of common and unusual bacteria, fungi, and viruses. HAIs are the most common complication of hospital care, occurring in approximately one in every 20 patients. The data presented do not include all HAIs; those presented in the table are required to be reported to the California Department of Public Health by all California general acute care hospitals: 63F65 64F66 Definitions from the California Department of Public Health : Central Line -associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) -- is a primary laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line at the time of (or within 48 -hours prior to) the onset of symptoms and the infection is not related to an infection from another site. Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infection (BSI) -- Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics calle d beta -lactams. These antibiotics include methicillin and other more common antibiotics such as oxacillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. In the community, most MRSA infections are skin infections . More severe or potentially life -threatening MRSA infections occur most frequently among patients in healthcare settings. Vancomycin -resistant Enterococci (VRE) Bloodstream Infection (BSI) -- Vancomycin -resistant enterococci are specific types of antimicrobial -resistant bacteria that are resistant to vancomycin, t he drug often used to treat infections caused by enterococci . Enterococci are bacteria that are normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract, and are often fou nd in the environment. These bacteria can sometimes cause infections . Most vancomycin -resistant Enterococci infections occur in Clostridium difficile is a bacterium that may develop due to the prolonged use of antibiotics during healthcare t reatment. Clostridium difficile infections cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis. Clostridium difficile can cause gastrointestinal infection; patients can be exposed to this bacterium through contaminated surfaces or the spo res can be transferred on unclean hands of others. Surgical Site Infection (SSI) -- A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. Surgical site infections can sometimes be superf icial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material. Not all surgical site infections are reported. Those reported were for total hip replacement, total knee replacement, abdominal surgery and open reduction internal fixation (repair fracture using hardware). 65 California Department of Public Health 66 California Health and Safety Code \u00a7\u00a71279.6, 1279.7, 1288.45 -1288.95 Health care Associated Infections Time Period SRMC rate CA rate Comments ICU CLABSI Jan-Dec 2011 1.35 0.94 rate/1000 central line days Med/Surg 2011 0 patient days VRE Jan-Dec 2011 0.94 0.52 rate/10,000 days C. patient days SSI* Apr '10 -Dec '11 0 Not reported (see note below) Source: California Department of Public Health - Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) Program - Public Reporting 44 | P a g e Access to Health Care Insurance Medicare Spending Medical Expenses Financial Assistance LOWERING THE COST OF CARE Making Coverage Affordable Health care costs continue to rise and as they take an increasingly larger bite out of American's expendable income, much debate and work has been done nationally to correct this problem. With government payors and large insurance companies directly payi ng most of the health care costs in Tuolumne County, lowering the cost of health care is ultim ately an issue for everyone . However it is important to have a local understanding of how health care costs are affecting the County's economic climate and resid ents' health status. A person's health status is directly related to affordability of quality health care. Research has shown that the quality and length of life are distinctly different for insured and uninsured populations, although insurability may be serving as a proxy for a number of other determinants of health care besides access to clinical services. 65F67 In 2001 the Institute of Medicine conducted a study which concluded that the lack of health insurance coverage was associated with 18,000 extra d eaths per year among uninsured adults in the US. 66F68 Another national study found that over a 17 -year follow -up period, adults who lacked health insurance at the outset had a 25 percent greater chance of dying than did those who had private health insuranc e. The cost of administering local safety net health insurance services to the public is incorporated into multiple programs that provide housing, food, job -training , child protective services and he alth services to those in need. A subset of the allocat ions that are received to meet the needs of the community, not including the costs of Behavioral Health Services and various environmental services, amount to nearly twenty million dollars from federal, state and local sources, of which over 50% is allocat ed directly to the community in the form of support for food, housing and health care. The remainder of these funds provide direct services to the public and support for the various programs of the Social Services and Public Health departments. Indicators This section of the Tuolumne County Community Health Assessment takes a retrospective look at health care economics at the County level over the past three to five years. In this section we will examine the following: Cost of health insurance pre miums from 2009 to 2013. Average Medicare spending per beneficiary Payor classes within the county Medical financial hardship index Uninsurance rates in the county Cost shifting from government to private insurance Findings One study suggests that a higher percent of income is spent in Tuolumne County for private insurance than the average for the state. At the writing of this assessment, insurance e xchanges under the Affordable Care Act are only beginning to be implemented. Because a primary goal of this legislation is to improve access to and affordability of insurance for those who are currently uninsured , the health care and health insurance affordability pic ture a few years from now will provide an excellent measure of the success of this effort. The committee looks forward to re -examining the issue and comparing today's data with future landmarks. 67 IOM. 2002.

This was the first of six books released during 2001 -04; see http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3809/ 4660/4662.aspx. 45 | P a g e Access to Health Care Insurance In 2009, a 35 -year old, single, non -smoking, healthy male living in Sonora would have paid 19% of his gross salary for an average health insurance policy. In 2013, that same Tuolumne County male would have had to pay 37% of his gross income for the same policy. These estimates are based on using one health insurance plan, and the census per ca pita income. 67F69 While this is only a sna pshot of the local insurance landscap e, such trends are one of the primary targets of the Affordable Care Act. In the fiscal year of 2011 to 2012, 16% of Tuolumne County residents younger than 65 had no health insurance coverage. Those with some form of insurance were covered by employers, state and federal programs such as County Medical Services Program (CMSP), Healthy Families, Medi -Cal, disability, self-pay or other sources. The vast majority of residents 65 years old and older are covered by Medicare. 68F70 The foothill county uninsured rate is considerably lower than both the state and national averag e. This is partly explained by the fa ct that Tuolumne County has fewer noncitizens than other counties in California with a large contingency of immigrant agricultural workers. However, the rate still estimates that at least 6,500 Tuolumne County reside nts are without health insurance. The number of uninsured residents may change as the Affordable Care Act unfolds. The uninsured population is calculated by estimating the number of persons eligible for insurance (generally those under 65) minus the estimated number of insured persons . 69 Source and Assumptions: 1. \"Makings Ends Meet: How Much Does it Cost To Raise a Family in California?\" A publication of the California Budget Project released in June 2010; 2.

A MSPB Measure ratio of greater than one indicates that the hospital's MSPB Amount is more expensive than the national median spending amount. This is calculated as the ratio of the standardized, risk adjus ted MSPB Amount for each hospital to the median MSPB Amount across all hospitals. The MSPB Amount is defined as the average spending level for a hospital divided by the average expected spending for the hospital times the standardized spending over all episodes across all hospitals. The MSPB Measure assesses Medicare pa rt A and Part B payments for services provided to a Medicare beneficiary during a spending per beneficiary episode that spans thr ee days prior to an inpatient admission to 30 days after discharge. Medical Expenses Financial Assistance The Sonora Regional Medical Center financial accounts show that fewer than 5% of hospital patients needed assistance for financial hardship for the years 2010 to 2012. The accounts with assistance are those that received reduced rates or were written off. Approximately 1,700 residents received supplemental income from Suppl emental Security Income and/or Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance . Med -Cal statistics show that about 8,000 people a year get assistance from the national government program (Medicaid) , financed by federal, state, and local funds . It functions as hospitalization and medical insurance for persons of all ages within certain income limits.

The Committee recognized that the issues included here are generally seen as environmental, social, and economic determinants - indirect (systemic) caus ation; however, the public d ialogue about health is expand ing the notion of what's health -related. T he Committee's objective was to engage that conversation specifically for Tuolumne County. The committee acknowledges that the topic of how a community enables healthy living is a relatively new aspect of the public dialogue on health not limited to the indicators selected above for this County Health Assessment. The selected indicators below most closely met the criteria used, but there are others that can be developed in the futu re that will greatly help in monitoring a nd diagnosing community health. Indicators Each of these indicators is essential to helping Tuolumne County provide the people who work and live here opportunities for living a healthier life: Access to an affordab le nutritious diet is fundamental to enabling opportunities for individual health. Homelessness, like poverty is an indicator of a difficult social environment for healthy living Research clearly indicates t hat living in poverty creates barriers to healt h and seriously limits opportunities for a healthy lifestyle Employment is a significant source for health insurance coverage and thus is an important determinant for affordable access to health care Crime rates are an important soc ial and economic indicator lead ing to h ealth issues related to exposure to violence, lack of a sense of security and stress. Transportation infrastructure provides individuals an opportunity to more fully integrate exercise as a viable option in this important aspect of o ur daily lives. Education is consistently associated with better individual health through health literacy and is another important indirect benchmark for monitoring community health. Air and Water quality data is readily available and is important to und erstanding bas ic environmental determinants of a community's health. Civic participation i s an issue the committee deemed important for its indirect association to health and as indication of the available volunteer pool to local non -profit organizations and public agencies working day to day with these issues. Findings There are a greater number of homeless individuals living in Tuolumne County than in o ther Sierra foothill counties. The local poverty rate Is generally higher in Tuolumne County , although the unemployment rate is somewhat lower. The air and water quality is generally good, although fluctuations exist depend ing upon unpredictable natural events like wildfires and weather conditions. Food Security Homelessness Poverty Employment Crime Rate Transportation Education Air and Water Quality Civic Participation 48 | P a g e Food Security Tuolumne County had 40.0 % of its students participating in the free and reduced lunch program. At 34.84 %, Amador County, had the smallest percentage of students participating in the school lunch program of the foothill counties, wh ile Calaveras County , had 42.8 % of their students participating. All counties had less than the statewi de and national average of 54.9% and 46.6 % respectively. The National School Lunch Program is a federally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions. It provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children each school day. The program was established under the National School Lunch Act, signed by President Harry Truman in 1946. In 1998, Congress expanded the National School Lunch Program to include reimbursement for snacks served to children in afterschool educational and enrichment programs to include children through 18 years of age. Of the foothill counties, in 2011, Tuolumne County had the highest percentage (8.4%) of households using Cal Fresh; however, more than 1,700 households with an income below the Federal Poverty Level threshold were not using the program . This may be due to a number of other eligibility requirements.

HUD changes the age criteria for each count, so comparisons are not valid for age cohorts. Tuolumne County shows a higher rate of homeless persons per 1,000 population than other footh ill counties. However, caution much be taken in this comparison, as the count is very dependent upon counting methods, and number and experience of those conducting the count. On odd years in January , the Central Sierra Continuum of Care volunteers conduc t a week -long survey of all homeless persons . In 2009, it is important to note that homeless people who were staying with friends and family, but did not have a shelter/home of their own, were not counted. These \"couch surfers\" were included in the count in 2011 and 2013.

The poverty rate for all p ersons living in the 3 county report area is less than the statewide average of 14.4 and national average of 14.3 percent. The poverty rate is the percent of the population living below the Federal Poverty Level for a household of a particular size. It should be noted that this rate does not imply that income levels above the poverty rate do not also face significant economic hardship. According to the American Community Survey 5 -year average, Calaveras County, had the lowest child poverty rate (7.2 percent) whi le Tuolumne County, had the highest child poverty rate of 19.5 percent. The poverty rate for children in each of the 3 counties is less than the national average of 19.2 percent and the state child poverty rate of 19.1 percent . With a 5 -year average senior poverty rate of 5.5% for people 65 years and older, Tuolumne County's poverty rate was in between Calaveras and Amador counties, and below the statewide and national averages. At 4.7%, Amador County, had the lowest percentage of seniors in poverty while Calaveras County, had the highest. According to American Community Survey estimates, 1,620 seniors, or 5.8% were living in poverty within the report area of the three Sierra foothill counties.

Tuolumne County's unemployment rate has been similar to California's rate during the 5 -year period , presumably reflecting the slow statewide and nat ional recovery from the recession of 2008 . The number of people reporting themselves as unemployed dropped from 3,046 in July 2012 to 2,367 in July 2013. As a cautionary note, some people drop off the employment roll due to job hunting fatigue; others may be employed, but underemployed at low or part -time salaries without benefits.

Sierra foothill counties display violent crime rates that are generally less than the overall state rate . Rates for each of the three demographically s imilar counties are about the same with background fluctuations. The foothill county's property crime rate has generally followed the same slight downhill trend reflected by the overall state rate , although a rising trend has been noted for Calaveras County, Tuolumne County's immediate northerly neighbor. Crime rates are reported as Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) rates and are the number of crimes per 100,000 population. Feeling safe at home, wor k and play is essential to enjoying a high quality of life. Sociological literature is replete with examples of an improved sense of wellbeing, a willingness to engage in social interactions and neighborhood activities when residences feel secure. 69F71 All of these variables have direct impacts on health. 71 Webb, D.et al Subjective Wellbeing and Security Social Indicators Research Series, Volume 46, Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg, 2012 - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Property Crime Rate Amador Calaveras Tuolumne California0100200300400500600700 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Violent Crime Rate Amador Calaveras Tuolumne California Source: California Office of the Attorney General Source: California Office of the Attorney General 53 | P a g e Transportation Bike Trails and Foot Paths Past expenditures for bicycle facilities and future financial needs for projects that improve safety and convenience for bicycle commuters in the Tuolumne County Bikeways and Trails Plan area are shown in the table below.

Other Means of Transportation When seniors were asked if there are any senior services not meeting their needs, most respondents in the 2011 Area 12 Agency on Aging noted problems with transportation . They stated that: Transportation is not always available It's difficult to obtain transportation Need more info on transportation Public transportation has p oor service, routes and frequency 54 | P a g e Education Educational Attainment Tuolumne County, like its neighboring counties, had a higher level of high school graduates than the state; however, the foothill counties had significantly lower percentage of residents with Bachelors and advanced degrees. Twenty -seven percent (27%) of our residents have an Associates, Bachelors or advanced degree. This compares to statewide attainment of college degrees of 38%. Educational attainment refers to the highest level of education that an individual has completed. California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) The percent of Tuolumne County students who passed the math CASHEE increased in the past three years, and remained fairly stable in their English performance. For all three years the y surpassed the statewide performance. All California public school students except eligible students with disabilities must satisfy the CAHSEE requirement, as well as all other state and local requirements, to receive a high school diploma. According to the California Department of Educations, the CAHSEE has two parts: English - language arts (ELA) and mathematics. The ELA part addresses state content standards through grade ten. In reading, this includes vocabulary, decoding, comprehension, an d analysis of information and literary texts. The mathematics part of the CAHSEE addresses state standards in grades six and seven and Algebra I. The exam includes statistics, data analysis and probability, number sense, measurement and geometry, mathemati cal reasoning, and algebra. Students are also asked to demonstrate a strong foundation in computation and arithmetic, including working with decimals, fractions, and percentages. 05101520253035 % No High School Diploma% High School Only% Some College% Associates % Bachelors % Graduate or ProfessionalEducational Attainment Amador County, California Calaveras County, California Tuolumne County, California California Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2011 Data Release, U N T Y S T A T E C O U N T Y S T A T E % P A S S I N G M A T H % P A S S I N G E N G L I S H T uolumne C ounty C A H SE E R e sults 2011 2012 2013 Source: California Department of Education 55 | P a g e Air and Water Quality The number of days that Tuolumne County exceeded sta te and national ozone air quality standards declined significantly since 2008. The number of days exceeding the standards increased slightly in the pas t few years, but never exceeded the 2009 levels. The chart summarizes progress made toward meeting state and national ambient air quality standards. Ozone in the upper atmosphere is necessary for our survival. Chemicals from car exhaust and some industries can react with sunlight to produce ground level ozone and smog, which are harmful to health . Another important component of Air Quality is the concentration of particulates suspended in the air. Smoke particles smaller than 2.5 microns can reach the small airways of our respira tory system where they act as a di rect irritant and a carrier of other chemical irritants . Such irritants can cause shortness of breath and throat irritation. Even at lower levels, smog aggravates asthma and breathing problems, and slows plant growth. The concentrations of these particle s are measured by \"PM 2.5 monitors. \" Aside from tobacco smoke, ambient smoke particles in Tuolumne County are often created by outdoor burns, wood stoves and wildfires. During major wildfires like the 2013 Rim Fire, the entire county can be affected by h azardous air quality, while at other times smoke may settle into basins where air quality can be quite variable. Hazardous particulate readings may be registered for various parts of the county for no days or for as many as 14 days per year or more depe nding upon the location and wildfire status . Drinking water is very highly regulated and monitored for biological and chemical contaminants . All major water systems serving the county, including Tuolumne Utilities District, Twain Harte Community Service District and Groveland Community Service District , report in their annual quality reports to the state that they are compliant with all state and federal regulations. The California Drinking Water Program, including large and small water systems, is curre ntly under the oversight of the California Department of Public Health and is assisted by the local Environmental Health Division of the Tuolumne County Community Resources Agency. When incidents occur that require water customers of large or small water systems to boil their water before drinking, a Boil Order is send to the water system customers. Reportable water -borne illnesses (Giardiasis, Cryptosporidiosis, Ca mpylobacteriosis) are monitored and occur sporadically but have not been related to domesti c water supplies in modern years .

The county's turnout was alw ays higher than the statewide turnout and always lower than Amador County's turnout. Voter registration and participation are indicators for how thoughtful and active a community is. It often shows how engaged the population is in current local, regional and national issues .

Th ey assessed Tuolumne County's health by collecting and analyzing data that reflect varied aspects of the well -being of our county. The y conducted their work in an impartial manner by seeking health indicators based upon the criteria of being relevant, rep roducible, available, understandable, reliable and important. These unbiased, and well -sourced data will set an informed base -line to be used for educat ion, priority setting, resource -seeking and community planning. The picture painted by this document highlights many of the traditional and non -traditional health -related issues that often burden rural communities. Access to health care can be limited as shown by the long wait time to set a first visit with a primary care physician. Disparity in income and the level of education for rural areas limits effective participation in the medical system for many and constructs obstacles to seek ing and procuring the care needed to prevent and treat chronic diseases. Employment opportunities are limited. This means that many families have low to no income . Thus, poverty rates tend to be high, especially for young families with children. Limited transportation disproportionately effects the high percentage of elder citizen s and those living in poverty. Very few sidewalks are available to make walking safe; bike lanes and walking trails that lead to services are rare , thus decreasing the opportunity to exercise in the course of daily activities like shopping and travel to work . Many citizens live above t he snow line, thus outdoor activities can be unsafe for many months of the year. Substance use disorders, including tobacco, drugs and alcohol, exact a disproportionate toll on local residents. It should be noted that the county is addressing many of the issues it identifies. For example, t he schools are diligent ly in working with students to become more physically fit , the Department of Social Services is working to decrease the recidivism in child abuse rate s, and a committee is working relentlessly to decrease the suicide rate . The work on this Community Health Assessment is an excellent example of how the community add resses issues. More than 20 community partners from all sectors of the county spent countless hours and resources to create this document. They identified where the county is doing well, and areas to improve. The people of Tuolumne County can use this do cument to identity aspects of the community they wish to keep and strengthen as solid pillars of health, and aspects which warrant efforts to enhance the determinants of health in the environment and thereby improve the future. This compell ing approach to taking the time and using the professional expertise of the community's leaders to look deeply at the county's health is a start in assuring an even healthier and more equitable future for Tuolumne County. The next step in this process is to use the insi ghts garnered in the Community Health Assessment to develop a Community Health Implementation Plan. This is accomplished by engaging community members who will delve deeply into the assessment, set criteria to prioritize the most compelling healthcare iss ues, and develop and participate in the Community Health Implementation Plan. The plan will be structured to be accountable to the citizens . of Tuolumne County. It will delineate the strategies, actions and resources required to address the most significant health needs that the County faces. 58 | P a g e APPENDIX - Summary of Findings Page Section Indicator Finding 7 Healthy Beginnings Prenatal Care Tuolumne County's rate of those receiving prenatal care declined significantly from 92.1% in 2006 to 76% in 2008 and then rose again to 84% in 2010. 8 Births to Adolescent Mothers The Tuolumne County birth rate for the total 15 to 19 year old population was 16.9 per 1000 and for the local non -Hispanic White population it was 15.5 per 1000. The California rate for the total population was 31.5 per 1000, and for the non -Hispanic White population it was 10.9 per 1000. 9 Breastfeeding Rate The rate of breastfeeding for Tuolumne County mothers is higher than that for the state overall. For the WIC population, 46.8% of mothers were exclusively breastfeeding their infants at 3 months and 35.2% of 6 month old infants were continuing to exclusively breastfe ed.
