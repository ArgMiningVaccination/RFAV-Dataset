This study explored the implementation of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) in primary care. The study's two goals included exploring the implementation of lung cancer screening primary care in the context of integrating a decision aid into the electronic health record and a designing of implementation strategies that target hypothesized mechanics of change and context-specific barriers. The two phases included a Qualitative Analysis phase including semi-structured interviews with primary care physicians to elicit key task behaviors, and an Implementation Strategy Design phase consisting of defining implementation strategies and hypothesizing causal pathways to improve screening with a decision aid. Fourteen interviews were conducted and out of that 3 key task behaviors and four behavioral determinants emerged. Strategies included increasing provider self-efficacy toward performing shared decision making and using the decision aid, improving provider performance expectancy, increasing social influence, and addressing key facilitators to using the decision aid.

This article described current practices and barriers met in conducting anal cancer screenings for women living with HIV (WLWH) in an urban integrated safety-net system and in a non-profit community-based HIV clinic. Semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative stakeholders were conducted to assess their screening for anal cancer experiences, knowledge, clinic practices and procedures. Barriers included limited knowledge of guidelines by providers and system-level issues such as lack of coordination between clinics and limitations on available resources. The authors concluded that screenings and follow-up require organization and coordination between multiple care teams, as well as improved clinical information systems to facilitate communication and infrastructure for managing abnormal results.

This study's purpose was to assess the consistency of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density reporting comparing digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with digital mammography (DM) and to evaluate density as a breast cancer risk factor when assessed using DM versus DBT. A secondary analysis of data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium was used from 342,149 women aged 40-79 years who underwent at least two screening mammography examinations less than 36 months apart. There were no significant differences in breast density assessment in pairs consisting of one DM and one DBT examination (57,516 of 74,729 [77%]), two DM and two DBT examinations (20,763 of 26,854). Results were similar when pair analysis was restricted to readings by the same radiologist. The breast cancer hazard ratios (HRs) for breast density were similar for DM and DBT. The HRs for density acquired using DM and DBT, respectively, were 0.55 and 0.37 for almost entirely fat, 1.47 and 1.36 for heterogeneously dense, and 1.72 and 2.05 for extremely dense breasts.

The authors examined commercially insured populations to identify patient-, physician-, and practice-level characteristics associated with ovarian cancer testing rates. They found that only 33.9% of patients with commercial insurance were tested during the time period studied. Medical and gynecologic oncologists had similar rates of testing, while other physicians tested less often. Although independent practices often lack access to genetic counselors, women in this study had insurance coverage for in-person and telephonic counseling. of germline BRCA testing in patients with ovarian cancer and commercial Netw Open 2022 Jan 4;5(1):e2142703. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.42703..

This study was conducted to describe clinical workflows for fecal immunochemical tests/fecal occult blood tests (FIT/FOBT) in Oregon primary care practices and to identify specific workflow processes that might be associated with higher colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates. Findings showed that primary care practices with higher CRC screening rates among newly age-eligible Medicaid enrollees had more established visit-based and population outreach workflows to support identifying patients due for screening, FIT/FOBT distribution, reminders, and follow up. Higher CRC screening was associated with having medical assistants discuss and review FIT/FOBT screening and instructions with patients. AHRQ-funded; HS022981. Citation: Mojica CM, Gunn R, Pham R .

BMC Cancer Frehn JL, Brewster AL, Shortell SM Comparing health care system and physician practice influences on social risk screening. This study examined the association of multilevel organizational capabilities and adoption of social risk screening among system-owned physician practices. A secondary analysis of the 2018 National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems data was conducted. Five social risks were used as measures for physician and system screening: food insecurity, housing instability, utility needs, interpersonal violence, and transportation needs. System-owned practices screened an average of 1.7 of the 5 social risks assessed. The differences were 16% attributable to practice variation between their health system owners, and 84% attributable to differences between individual practices. Practices owned by hospital systems screened for an additional 0.44 social risks relative to practices of systems without hospitals. Characteristics associated with more social risk screening included health information technology capacity, innovation culture, and patient engagement strategies. health care system and physician practice influences on social risk screening.

A mixed-method assessment. In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) revised clinical recommendations to more broadly recommend abnormal blood glucose screening and more clearly recommend referral to behavioral interventions for adults with prediabetes. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the 2015 USPSTF recommendation changes on abnormal blood glucose screening and referral to behavioral interventions, and to examine physicians' perceptions of the revised recommendation.

The objective of this study was to describe out-of-pocket costs for colposcopy and related services among age-appropriate, commercially insured women from 2006 to 2019. Findings suggested that out-of-pocket costs for colposcopy were very common and significant and have increased over time. Reported out-of-pocket costs for cervical cancer screening-related care, such as office visits, were not included, thus the findings may underestimate patients' total financial burden.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore primary care provider (PCP) awareness, knowledge, and attitudes toward masked hypertension (MHT.) The researchers conducted 3 focus groups which included 30 PCPs from 3 medical centers in New York. The analysis and thematic content analysis found that there was low knowledge about the prevalence and impact of MHT, awareness of MHT among the participants varied, and only 2 providers had diagnosed MHT. While some PCPs were receptive to MHT screening after learning about its significance, others perceived the current evidence as insufficient to change practice. There was broad consensus for lifestyle changes for MHT but concerns about a lack of randomized trial evidence for antihypertensive medication, and the possibility of harmful side effects. The researchers concluded that limited PCP knowledge about MHT, insufficient evidence, already overburdened PCPs, and concerns about the accuracy and accessibility of screening tests were key barriers to screening and treatment for MHT.

This study sought to understand the association between social needs and chronic health conditions using a screening tool and clinical data from Electronic Health Records. From April 2018 to December 2019, 33,550 adult patients completed a 10-item social needs screening tool during primary visits in Bronx and Westchester Counties, NY. A positive, cumulative association between social needs and each of the eight outcomes asked about was found. The relationship was strongest for elevated PHQ-2 (depression screening), alcohol/drug use disorder, and smoking. Those with 3 or greater social needs were 3.9 times more likely to have an elevated PHQ-2 than those without needs. Healthcare transportation challenges was associated with each condition and was the most strongly associated need with half of conditions in the fully-adjusted models. Examples included those with an alcohol/drug use disorder (84% more likely), and smokers (41% more likely). AHRQ-funded; HS026396. Citation: Heller CG, Rehm CD, Parsons AH .

This paper describes a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of primary care practice facilitation and telehealth services on evidence-based screening, counseling, and pharmacotherapy for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care practices in North Carolina with 10 or fewer providers. The study will produce important evidence about the effect of practice facilitation on uptake of evidence-based screening, counseling, and pharmacotherapy for unhealthy alcohol use when delivered on a large scale to small and medium-sized practices. The results of this rigorously conducted evaluation are expected to have a positive impact by accelerating the dissemination and implementation of evidence related to unhealthy alcohol use into primary care practices.

This paper describes an evidence-based intervention that was created to reduce mammography appointment no-show rates in underserved women at safety net clinics. An academic-community partnership was used to implement four strategies to improve the adoption and scale-up of the interventions with Federally Qualified Health Centers and charity care clinics. The interventions implemented were: (1) an outreach email blast targeting the community partner member clinics to increase program awareness, (2) an adoption video encouraging enrollment in the program, (3) an outreach webinar educating the community partner member clinics about the program, encouraging enrollment and outlining adoption steps, and (4) an adoption survey adapted from Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs from the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network for cancer control interventions with Federally Qualified Health Centers.

Despite the importance of social determinants in health outcomes, little is known about the best practices for screening and referral during clinical encounters. This study aimed to implement universal social needs screening and community service referrals in an academic emergency department (ED), evaluating for feasibility, reach, and stakeholder perspectives. The investigators concluded that despite the limited time and technical barriers, few patients with social needs ultimately received service referrals. AHRQ-funded; HS026505.

This retrospective cohort study examined the outcomes of screening mRNA COVID-19 vaccine risk using patient-reported anaphylactic history at a single academic hospital employee vaccination program. Although rare, m-RNA COVID-19 vaccines have been contraindicated in patients with known allergy to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000 present in the lipid nanoparticle carrier system of these vaccines. Health care workers and other affiliates who met criteria based on the Tennessee Department of Health COVID-19 Vaccination Plan received the first dose of Pfizer m-RNA vaccine. Out of 23,035 individuals who were screened before dose 1, 31 reported a high-risk allergy history that triggered a focused review by the Allergist On-Call. Out of those 31, only 3 were recommended not to proceed to Dose 1 and were referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic for assessment. Ultimately, all individuals were cleared to receive their first dose, and none reported an adverse reaction. AHRQ-funded; HS026395. Citation: Krantz MS, Stone CA, Rolando LA .

This study describes a health system's experience from 2018 to 2020 to scale social needs of screening of patients within a large urban primary care ambulatory network. This program took place at an academic medical center within an ambulatory network of 18 primary care practices located in the Bronx, New York. The study used electronic health records of 244,764 patients who had a clinical visit from April 2018 to 2019. The authors organized measures using the RE-AIM framework domains of reach and adoption to ascertain the number of patients who were screened and the number of providers who adopted screening. A total of 53,093 patients were screened for social needs, representing 21.7% of the patients seen. Almost one-fifth (19.6%) of patients reported at least one unmet social need, varying by both practice location and specialty within practices. Slightly more than half (51.8%) of providers screened at least one patient. needs screening in practice: a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of data from electronic health records from Bronx county, New York, USA.
