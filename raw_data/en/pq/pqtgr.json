HILL, DC Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer/Chairman, Scientific Advisory Committee What makes Copaiba different from Black Pepper or other essential oils high in caryophyllene? I am so excited about the new Rose Touch! What are some of your favorite ways to use it? In a daily use model, how would Blue Tansy benefit me? Try these new dTERRA essential oilsCopaiba is high in the sesquiterpene caryophyllene, which is also found in Clove, Black Pepper, Melissa, and several other essential oils. However, it is the breadth of its benefits that make Copaiba a unique essential oil. Like Black Pepper, it is effective as a surface cleaner and has high value as an antioxidant, but probably Copaiba's most researched and valued property is its benefits to your skin. Along with supporting overall health and having the ability to reduce the appearance of minor skin blemishes, there is evidence to suggest that topical application of Copaiba may have biological activity in supporting health at the cellular level and in tissue remodeling. Try adding a drop or two to your skin moisturizer to boost its soothing and health-supporting benefits, and enjoy the distinct woody aroma. We are all excited about the newly released Rose Touch, it will provide an opportunity for many more people to experience this amazing and rare oil. The best thing about it is that the pre-diluted application model provides the perfect combination of Fractionated Coconut Oil and Rose essential oil to deliver the most benefit while minimizing waste. Rose is one of the best essential oils for skin health and it only gets better when combined with the amazing emolliating benefit of Fractionated Coconut Oil. My wife carries around a bottle of Rose Touch in her purse to use throughout the day for moisturizing and to apply directly to minor skin irritations, and sometimes she just likes to pop the cap and smell the relaxing aroma. The most distinct characteristic of Blue Tansy essential oil is its concentration of bicyclic sesquiterpene chamazulene, which provides its blue-violet color, but it also contains several more commonly known constituents such as the monoterpene, sabinene. In a daily use model, Blue Tansy is great for skin care as experimental research has shown that chamazulene has a multitude of skin health benefitting properties. Sabinene rich oils have been reported to reduce the appearance of blemishes and chamazulene can be soothing. Add Blue Tansy to your lotion or daily skin toner, and don't be alarmed that it will change the color. For a soothing massage, try diluting it in Fractionated Coconut Oil and combining with a few drops of Lavender or Helichrysum and massaging into shoulders and neck. 4 / FALL 2017 LIVING MAGAZINEdoterra.com / 5 Essential Oil Spotlight Fun Fact: It takes approximately 252,000 individual petals (or 8,000 rose flowers) to produce one 5ml bottle of rose oil. This is the equivalent to 42 lbs. of rose petals. Apply to the palms of your hands, cup your hands over your nose, and inhale deeply for an uplifting sensation. Apply to neck and wrists for a beautiful and romantic personal fragrance. Apply to pulse points to uplift mood throughout the day. Use on skin to aid in balancing moisture levels and reduce the appearance of skin imperfections.Rose oil, one of the most precious essential oils in the world, has one of the most labor- intensive production processes and yields very little oil per petal. Because of this, Rose oil commands a high price. do-TERRA Rose Touch combines Fractionated Coconut Oil with Rose essential oil. This provides the user with myriad applications and usage options that are both affordable and convenient. How to use :Aromatic Description: Floral, dry sweet Distillation Method: Steam Sourcing Origin: BulgariaPlant Part: Flower Rose * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Brazil occupies roughly half of South America, covering a total area of 3,287,357 square miles. Within that area is 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest. Representing over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, the Amazon is comprised of the largest and most biodiverse area of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees. Therein lie the trees from which we source Copaiba oleoresin, which is distilled to produce Copaiba essential oil. Copaiba essential oil is so unique and effective because of its high level of beta-caryophyllene. Copaiba has the highest levels of beta-caryophyllene that we are aware of. Beta-caryophyllene, also known as BCP, is a terpene. In 2008, European scientists learned that beta-caryophyllene had cannabinoid-like properties. Like many other cannabinoids and terpenes, BCP targets the body's CB2 receptors, ignoring the CB1 receptors that are involved in supplying the high associated with cannabis and, more specifically, the THC cannabinoid. Thus Copaiba essential oil has the ability to deliver major benefits without giving you the high. For this reason Copaiba essential oil has become an invaluable part of the dTERRA collection. Copaiba essential oil can be found in items such as soaps, creams, lotions, and perfumes. Since the 16th century, Copaiba has been used in traditional health practices. We now use it to help support the health of the cardiovascular, immune, digestive, nervous, and res piratory systems.* It's also a power ful antioxidant that promotes immune health.* Copaiba essential oil is derived from the oleoresin of the copaiba tree, which can grow from 60 to 100 feet tall. The process of harvesting the copaiba oleoresin is similar to how one would tap a maple tree. A harvester will look for healthy trees that have large diameter trunks. They then drill a small hole approximately three feet from the ground. Once the hole has been drilled, the sawdust is cleaned off and the oleoresin collector is put in place. The harvester will generally be able to collect some oleoresin immediately. Once the oleoresin has been collected from the initial tap, a plug is inserted into the hole and the harvester will return to the tree every few weeks to collect additional oleoresin. The Amazon rainforest is very dense and nearly impossible to travel through with conventional vehicles. As such most travel for both personal and commercial purposes is done by boat. The complex network of smaller tributaries and larger rivers become the roads and highways by which goods are delivered. COPAIBA Essential oil of the Amazon 6 / FALL 2017 LIVING MAGAZINEdTERRA utilizes a large network of harvesters that transport their copaiba oleoresin by boat from their different villages to Manaus. Once the oleoresin has been inspected, paid for, and collected in Manaus, we work with our distillation partner to steam distill the oleoresin and prepare it for final shipment to the US. During a recent sourcing trip, Ben Platt, dTERRA Strategic Sourcing Manager for the Americas, met a family of copaiba harvesters that were not a part of our current network. As they talked about copaiba, the harvester expressed frustration that he was getting pressured about the price for his copaiba oleoresin and that payment would frequently come much later than agreed upon. \"As I was talking with this family I quickly recognized that they were the type of people that dTERRA prefers to work with. It was clear that they knew their copaiba harvesting area very well. It was also clear that they were hardworking, honest people that would harvest the copaiba in the sustainable manner that dTERRA requires. We encouraged them to join our harvesting group and assured them that we would pay them on-time and at fair prices for their oleoresin. They were excited by this proposition and agreed to join our harvesting group. We are definitely glad that this family has joined the network of families that are now a key part of the dTERRA Global Botanical Network. This experience goes to highlight the importance of our mission to source the world's most beautiful oils from some of the world's best people. We source great people as much as we source essential oils.\" * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

The birth of his daughter in November 2015 made it challenging for CJ and his wife to find any spare time. Meals became \"on the go\" and time after work was time spent with family before putting the baby to bed. After working all day, the only thing CJ had the energy to do was sit, and maybe catch up on a TV show, before going to sleep. As a result, CJ ended up packing on a significant amount of weight. While weight loss was the ultimate goal, CJ needed to address the underlying problems caused by poor health and lifestyle choices. Seeing his daughter become more and more active as she learned to walk, run, and play became one of the main motivations for CJ to push his body in hopes to gain energy, reset bad habits, and ultimately lose weight. He says, \"I don't just want to watch her do these things. I want to be there with her and be the one who gets to show her all the exciting things that this beautiful world has to offer.\" CJ's Story Going over 250 pounds was the largest I've ever been, and as much as I kept convincing myself that I was going to make a change, I kept eating fast food and not working out. I've tried many times to jump-start a new healthy lifestyle, but it always seemed to burn bright in the beginning, and then burn out quickly. My wife tried having multiple conversations with me about wanting to cut processed foods from our diet or quit sugar for a month, and I was onboard but I never fully committed. When she suggested I do the dTERRA Slim and Sassy challenge, she appealed to my competitive nature, and suddenly we were both onboard and fully committed! Breaking the Old Habits When we first started the challenge my wife created a Facebook group to help keep me motivated. We invited friends, family, and other Wellness Advocates to join us on this journey. We posted progress updates, as well as what we found most helpful about each of the products we were using. We reached out to others for suggestions, and the addition of community helped motivate me through the challenge. The first month was the hardest, especially with the cravings. I craved something sweet at the end of a meal. A drop of Fennel, a large glass of water with some Slim and Sassy in it, or a bowl of fruit would help reprogram my cravings. We had to plan social outings well in advance to prepare ourselves for any temptations. Alcohol was another tough one to cut back. I knew there were a lot of empty calories in beer, but I got so used to having one or two after getting home from work. It was hard going out with friends and only drinking water. I did find that sparkling water is a great replacement, or water with a drop of Peppermint and/or Lemon. Trying to balance time was no easy task\u2014 time for work and time for family. My wife wakes up at 4:30 a.m. to work out, and I get up and make our TrimShakes for breakfast and lunch along with packing fruit, veggies, and some nuts. When she gets home, I head to work out at 6:45 a.m. and she gets our daughter up. Steps to Change Between a good night's sleep with the dTERRA Serenity\u00ae Softgels, taking the Mito2Max\u00ae, and getting to the gym, my wife and I found that we had more than enough energy in the morning and well into the day. CJ'S TIPS FOR SUCCESS 1 Make it a Lifestyle\u2014Everything changes for the long haul. It was never just a three-month stint for me. It was a three-month sprint, but once we got to the finish line we were never going to stop running. 2 Get Support\u2014the guys I work out with encouraged me as well and talking with others about what I was doing helped me remember it for myself. The Facebook group with our friends and family, including other dTERRA advocates, was great for sharing our thoughts and challenges and getting support. \u00ae BEFOREdoterra.com / 9 3 Stay Committed\u2014the first couple weeks were by far the hardest. The diet change was difficult. It was hard to turn down the sweets and snacks that were basically everywhere. But after a couple of weeks, my taste buds changed. I was never a big fan of cherry tomatoes, now they are like candy to me. It was almost like my body eventually re-set and realized how good natural food is and how great you feel after eating healthy food.4 Don't Starve Yourself\u2014talking to friends and family who had tried various other diets, a common reason for failing was from being too hungry and then caving on the vending machine. We made sure to give ourselves plenty of healthy food. 5 Plan Your Meals\u2014if we didn't plan our meals for the week ahead of time we were doomed. Do the research, go to the store and prep as much as possible. If I don't have a lunch packed, I'm probably going to eat something bad instead. If we don't have dinner thought out when we get home, chances are pizza is getting delivered. Taking the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae also added such an increase in energy in our lives! My daughter loves being outside and on the go, and it is wonderful to be able to keep up and catch every smile as she goes. doTERRA Slim & Sassy TrimShake made a perfect post-workout treat that kept me full until lunch. I also carry a large stainless steel bottle with me all day now with water mixed with a few drops of the Slim & Sassy Metabolic Blend in it. Occasionally I add Peppermint to help me stay cool while I work outside. Halfway through the challenge, we decided to do an additional cleanse and loved it so much we kept the DDR Prime\u00ae and PB Assist\u00ae+ in our supplement lineup. I was so close to the weight loss goal and I feel very proud of what I accomplished in three months. True, the scale never hit the 204.5, but I did lose 8 percent body fat and gained in muscle. I sleep better, have more energy, and I'm much more aware of what I put into my body. Between exercise, nutrition, and supplements, I am excited for the continued transformation and the lifestyle that is here to stay. doterra.com / 9dTERRA\u00ae Performance Advocate Jamie Mitchell grew up in a small town in the Northern New South Wales in Australia. Since his dad was a surfer, Jamie spent the majority of his childhood on the beach. For Jamie, the ocean became his playground, gym, office, home, and a way of life. His fearless attitude, passion for the water, and competitive nature made him one of the world's elite ocean athletes. Throughout his career Jamie has had many victorious achievements, but his most memorable moments were winning 10 consecutive Molokai to Oahu World Championship Paddleboard races, and World Surf League Big Wave Event in Portugal, as well as surfing in the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational in 2016. However, he says his biggest accomplishment in life is being a husband and being a father to his little girl. WHAT COUNTRIES HAVE YOU SURFED, AND WHAT'S BEEN YOUR FAVORITE PLACE? I have surfed in Australia, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tahiti, Indonesia, Hawaii, Mexico, France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Morocco, South Africa, and Monaco. But my favorite has always been and will be Hawaii. IF YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW TO SURF, WHERE WOULD IT BE? It would be somewhere I haven't been, so maybe Micronesia. WHERE DO YOU DRAW YOUR INSPIRATION FROM? I draw inspiration from lots of different people. I love watching athletes like\u2014Roger Federer, Tiger Woods, Kelly Slater, and Michael Jordan who are able to thrive under pressure. I also draw inspiration from my family who sacrificed a lot for me to be where I am today. There are so many people who are doing amazing things in the world so it's easy to be inspired. WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR HEAD AS YOU ARE RIDING THE BIG WAVE? WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU WIPE OUT? I just try to stay as calm as I can. I try not to overthink the situation and do what I have trained to do and have done many times over. As for wiping out, you have to stay calm and collected. Find your happy place and relax. If you fight and stress, you are basically killing yourself as you will lose your oxygen and deplete your levels, so it's all about conserving every bit of energy while underwater. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WAS YOUR MOST DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE? What we do is very dangerous. My worst wipeout was in Western Australia a few years ago when I went over the falls with the lip of a wave, and hit so hard that I blacked out underwater. When I was able to make it to the surface, I had torn the MCL of my right knee, fractured my left elbow, and hurt my shoulder. So it wasn't a fun flight back home. IS THERE A SPECIFIC TRAINING ROUTINE THAT YOU FOLLOW? I love hot Yoga, so I try and do yoga 3-4 times a week. I still try and swim and do some breathing exercise 3-4 times a week, and, if I can fit it in, a few cardio workouts, but with a young daughter and my wife being 6 months pregnant, time is scarce these days. Our family loves eating a clean balanced diet. HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT dTERRA? My wife Cassandra loves the oils and became a Wellness Advocate two years ago. Funny story, she walked into the house with an Every Oil Kit and I freaked out, not really knowing anything about essential oils. But it has become a huge part of our family's life, as well as a huge part of my every day health. I use the oils every day and especially when I'm travelling. They keep me healthy and ready to surf. WHAT ARE YOU FAVORITE dTERRA PRODUCTS AND HOW DO YOU NORMALLY USE THEM? I love so many products. But I came up with what I call a Surfer's Travelling Kit; Peppermint, Lemon, Oregano, dTERRA and dTERRA Serenity\u00ae Softgels.

Many people put their names into the raffle to determine who could go on one of the six planned trips to either Nepal, Guatemala, or Bulgaria. Bulgaria is the focus of a C-Impact Sourcing \u00ae project to both help the struggling economy there by revitalizing the essential oil industry while sourcing quality oils. The dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation is an integral part of the work happening. The first of the two trips planned for Bulgaria took place the first week in July, with a second group going one week later. Those participating in these trips knew they were in for something special. Projects to Empower Communities The main focus of both trips to Bulgaria was to provide a much-needed playground for a community center. Community centers in Bulgaria typically house a variety of functions, such as a post office, library, town hall, and a public meeting house and gathering area. Adding a safe play area for the children was a priority in this community. The volunteers went to work\u2014they sanded the existing teeter-totters, sanded and refinished benches, and sanded and repainted the existing fence. Meanwhile, community members assembled the new playground. This is the third playground that dTERRA has donated to local Bulgarian community centers. Beyond the playground, Wellness Advocates volunteered for a day at the Milk Canteen, an organization that provides meals to families with children between the ages of one to three at a subsidized cost with help from dTERRA. Workers there estimate that they serve between 500-1000 children a day. The experience then finished off with dinner made by youth at the nonprofit organization, the Social T eahouse, which the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation helped refurbish in early 2016. The Social T eahouse works to help orphaned children learn personal and professional skills that help them leave the orphanages with access to the labor market. Making it Possible The volunteers took some time to go to the Bulgarian Esseterre Distillery, the operation that makes all the efforts to build up Bulgaria through industry and humanitarian projects possible. The distillery currently produces Lavender, Melissa, and Frankincense essential oils for dTERRA. Sarah Wimmer, a Wellness Advocate from Arizona, says of her experience, \"It is amazing to see the whole process of creating an oil, and the care and precision that goes into each step of the process. From the field to the lab, dTERRA has set a high expectation and standards of excellence that will only allow for the best of the best to be produced. I am honored to have been on this trip and to be a part of a company that gives back so much to communities.\" doterra.com / 15Do you have a curious little explorer or an inquisitive future scientist always asking questions about how the world works? Maybe you have a future chemist, doctor, or astronomer who loves learning and can't get enough science. Well dTERRA has the program for you: dTERRA Science for Kids! Launched at the beginning of 2017, dTERRA Science for Kids offers videos, educational modules, experiments, and activities to help kids (as well as their parents) explore the world around them and get excited about science. Promoting science education through all grade levels is a passion shared by the dTERRA Science for Kids team and by Chief Medical Officer, Dr. David K. Hill, DC. For many years Dr. Hill has sought to combine his work with dTERRA with his desire to promote science education for children. With the addition of the \"Science for Kids\" tab on the dTERRA Science Blog, his wish started to take shape. \"My hope for the dTERRA Science for Kids program is that children will discover that science is fun and fascinating, and that they'll share their enthusiasm with their parents,\" Dr. Hill explained when talking about the program. \"As a science-based company, what better way for doTERRA to give back than to help foster a love of science in the next generation?\" Local Community Outreach From there dTERRA Science for Kids has continued to grow, incorporating community outreach initiatives into the program. Since the program's start in January, dTERRA Science for Kids team members have already presented in several Utah elementary school classrooms, teaching about the plant life cycle and providing a fun, easy experiment for students to participate in. It's a great opportunity for dTERRA to give back to the community by volunteering in classrooms while also helping ignite students' curiosity and desire to learn more. Additionally, dTERRA Science for Kids hosted its first two dTERRA Science for Kids Summer Day Camps at the dTERRA global campus. With presentations by dTERRA scientists Nicole Stevens and Cody Beaumont and dTERRA Facilities Manager Rusty Keller this camp provided kids an opportunity to explore the wetlands and grounds surrounding dTERRA and the onsite manufacturing facility. Each presentation encouraged participants to ask questions and to use the scientific method to find answers. Kids got to learn more about science while dTERRA volunteers got to help the kids explore and participate in a unique opportunity. Future dTERRA Science for Kids camps, featuring dTERRA scientists with different specialties, are already in the planning stages, and the dTERRA Science for Kids team is eager to make these camps available to more participants in the upcoming months.INTRODUCING dTERRA SCIENCEFORKIDSFORKIDS 16 / WINTER 2017 LIVING MAGAZINEWhile the program is just beginning, dTERRA Science for Kids has made significant progress in its first few months. Currently the focus is on local schools and community efforts, but as the program continues growing the dTERRA Science for Kids team hopes to expand into new schools, to increase summer day camp possibilities, and to explore new options that will help kids gain a passion for science. The program is even looking into junior high and high school presentation options in addition to volunteering with established science programs. How to Get Involved With all of these awesome efforts, you may be wondering how you can get involved. A great place to start is by using and sharing the online materials dTERRA Science for Kids has already produced. Do you have a child curious about how memory, emotions, or even senses work? Or maybe you need some direction in helping your kids understand nutrition and why it's so important. dTERRA Science for Kids can help as you work with your kids to assist them in learning about the world around them. Your inner child might even learn a thing or two as you participate in simple and enlightening experiments with the children in your life.

Can you believe that it is fall again? F. Scott Fitzgerald said in The Great Gatsby, \"Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.\" Growing up in T ucson, Arizona, meant the crisp temp\u00ad eratures of fall were 80-90 degrees. No matter where we live and no matter the temperature drop, fall means it is time for the kids to go back to school. It means that our kids who have been playing outside every day with a few of the neighborhood kids are now going to be in classrooms with 30 other children, and going to recess with hundreds of others. It means more stress in our homes as we try to stay on top of homework assignments, class projects, and extra\u00adcurricular activities. It also means that we begin dealing with some seasonal environmental threats as the weather changes and we start to spend more time indoors. How might we use dTERRA products to deal with the changes that fall brings? Supporting Healthy Brain Activity School stresses the brain as we are constantly presented with new information and try to assimilate that into our brains. No matter the level of learning, from \"new math\" to calculus, from letter recognition to writing a haiku, we need our brain to function optimally. Essential fatty acids have been shown to support healthy brain function. While Omega-6 fatty acids are important, we have a diet rich in these and do not need any help in consuming more. The optimal consumption of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids are a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, we often need a good daily supplement to increase our Omega-3 fatty acids to obtain that balance. IQ Mega \u00ae or xEO Mega\u00ae can help balance our ratio in fatty acids, thereby supporting healthy brain development in kids and brain function in adults.* Promoting Feeling of Calmness My mother was an elementary school teacher while I was growing up. She would often comment that on windy days, children came in from recess out of control. It became very difficult to promote a learning environment in her classroom for the rest of the day. She had a theory that the wind disrupts the ionic field around the body, causing kids to feel very unsettled. As I think about what I know now, I would have recommended diffusing Lavender, Cedarwood, or Petitgrain on those days to promote feelings of calmness and relaxation. dTERRA Balance \u00ae and dTERRA Serenity\u00ae could also be used for their grounding effects. Maintaining a Healthy Gut Recent studies have shown gut microbes shape the architecture of sleep and stress reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This means that the type of bacteria we have in our gastrointestinal tract changes how well we sleep, how we react to stress, and how healthy our hormonal system is.

This is not always easy to do with the schedule of family activities and school lunches. PB Assist \u00ae Jr. is like candy in my house. My kids have a tube every day and would have several if we would let them. They love it and I feel confident that I am helping support the brain function for memory and cognition needed for the rigors of school.* Getting Quality Sleep Sleep becomes especially important as we try to learn new information and retain that information for recall. Several studies have shown that lack of sleep leads to worsening memory. Children ages 6 to 13 need 9 to 11 hours of sleep per night. T eenagers ages 14 to 18 need slightly less, about 8 to 10 hours. Adults need anywhere from 7 to 9 hours of sleep. This is often difficult as we lay down at night after finishing homework, studying for a test, or working on a group assignment for class. Our brains seem to want to continue working on the problem at hand despite needing to sleep. Petitgrain, Vetiver, and Lavender oil applied to bedding or pillows as well as applying to the bottom of the big toe, where, in Eastern Medicine, the pineal gland is connected, can help prepare for a restful night's sleep. There is nothing better as a parent than to take a few moments at the end of the day and sit on the edge of the bed rubbing oils into your children's feet and talking about their day. This not only promotes sleep, but promotes good relationships in your home as well.

We are often wrapped up in how \"we don't have time\" or \"we're too busy.\" We may wonder if we are truly able to make a positive impact on another's life when we have such busy schedules. There are many times when we are too busy and don't have time to share, but we shouldn't hesitate to use the time we do have to make an impact in the lives of others. So what can we do when we only have a few minutes to serve those around us? Sharing the AromaT ouch\u00ae Hand T echnique is a powerful act of service that doesn't require much time. We have been touched with how many of you have already taken this to heart and have been constantly using the AromaT ouch T echnique to make a positive impact on those around you.

T aking the lion's share of the weight at home while I build our business has taken a toll on him. His focus has been on making sure our five little ones are well cared for and, as a result, has neglected what his body needs. At the time, I didn't know exactly what was wrong, so I decided to support his entire body using our tried and true AromaT ouch T echnique. I managed to convince him to roll out of bed and onto my massage table. Forty minutes later, he was completely relaxed and sleeping deeply. I love that the AromaT ouch T echnique oils are the catch-all net that help support the body while also relaxing and balancing it. This morning my hubby was up and out of bed before me so I'm guessing he is feeling much better! \u2014Alicia Simon The Power of Touch The power of touch is profound. It soothes, nourishes, and heals; it is a fundamental part of our life. T oday I went to visit my 102-year-old grandma who\u2014unless she bounces back like she has for years\u2014is most likely transitioning into the final days of her life here on earth and on to her everlasting life up in heaven. She is still as sweet as ever, but you could tell this time was a little different. She's a little less energetic and there are other signs, but I went with the intent to give her an AromaT ouch Hand T echnique along with a foot massage with my essential oils. This lady has done so much for me, so this was a final act of service that I could give her: a caring touch to let her know that she means the world to me. She didn't say much, but would exclaim, 'Oh, you don't know how good that feels!' over and over. I know the oils are doing something for her, but the touch\u2014that's what it was all about today. Remember the power of touch! \u2014Becca DallainBonding Experience My 9-year-old son had a really hard day on Monday. I won't go into detail, but there were other kids and hurt feelings. I told him he would feel better if he would let me give him an AromaT ouch Hand T echnique. He was skeptical, but he let me do it anyway. I got out my Wild Orange oil. It is such an uplifting scent. I took extra time and care in his AromaT ouch Hand T echnique to show him that I cared. By the time I was finished, he was much calmer. We cuddled some (I'm so glad he still likes to cuddle!) I jokingly said, 'Can you admit your mommy was right and that the oils helped a teeny tiny bit?' He smiled a small smile and replied, 'No, they helped a lot!' I had forgotten what a bonding experience it is to apply essential oils to my kids! \u2014Sarah DeGroff Would you like to share more of your stories with us?

Essential oils have been a part of perfumery since early 2000 BC, when they were used by the ancient Egyptians. They used them as a status sym-bol for superiority, used by aristocrats, politicians, athletes, and royalty. Oils were also specifically sought after for their health benefits. These powerful aromatic fragrances played a major part in ritual, beauty, and commerce, just as they do today. Here is a simple guide to creating and customizing your own toxin-free essential oil fragrance.Elevate the \"Scentses\" Essential Oils & Perfumes FRAGRANCE NOTES BLENDING HOW TOEssential oils can be separated into three categories or notes: base, middle, and top. It is important to remember that when you are blending, top notes are the first thing you smell and last a relatively short amount of time. Top notes make up between 5-20 percent of the perfume blend. Middle notes are the next group of oils you will smell. Once the top note wears off, middle notes start to become more prominent; this can happen anywhere from 20-60 minutes after application. These are known as the body, bouquet, or heart of the fragrance and make up between 50-80 percent of the perfume blend. After an hour or two, you will begin to smell the base notes. Base notes are the oils that last the longest and are usually floral or woody scents. Base notes, like top notes, make up between 5-20 percent of the perfume. When creating your own natural perfume fragrance, adding alcohol or carrier oils such as Fractionated Coconut Oil, can help tone down overpowering oils and even prolong the life of your custom fragrance. When you are ready to create your own essential oil perfume blend remember, the middle is the heart but the base ties it all together. So, choose your favorites from the base and middle oils first, and then \"top\" it off. For example, let's say you want a blend that is both woody and masculine but is versatile enough to be light and feminine. You would want to choose oils from the base and middle note sections that have deep, rich aromas but are still fresh and clean like Cedarwood, Sandalwood, and Juniper Berry. Next you will want to choose one or more oils from the top note section that are consistent with the theme but also give the blend that extra kick, like Siberian Fir and Grape-fruit. Now, you want to blend them. Add 4 drops Cedarwood, 5 drops Sandalwood, 4 drops Juniper Berry, 5 drops Grapefruit, and 2 drops Siberian Fir to your bottle (we liked the 10mL amber bottle for this blend). Once you have the oils in the bottle, cap and shake to combine. Make sure the blend is what you were going for, then top off with dTERRA Fractionated Coconut Oil.TOP Basil Bergamot Clary Sage Coriander Wintergreen MIDDLE Black Fennel, Sweet Geranium Juniper Melissa Cedarwood, Sandalwood and Vetiver Fresh: Bergamot, Grapefruit, Wild Orange 22 / FALL 2017 LIVING MAGAZINEFor Him - The Nomad FOR HER- The TravelerRECOMMENDED DIY FRAGRANCES Carrier Top off with dTERRA\u00ae Fractionated Coconut Oil (or carrier oil of choice).

Depending on the study you are examining or the person you ask, supplements are either absolutely critical for optimum health or are not likely to make a tangible impact on your health. What is not disputable is the fact that the average Western diet promotes nutrient deficiencies, which have a definitive impact on countless markers of health. Whether you are an elite athlete or Joe Average just looking for convenient and cost-effective ways to improve your daily well-being, there are few easier ways to accomplish this than by integrating dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae (LLV) into your daily routine\u2014and dTERRA scientists have gathered the clinical data that explains why. Let's examine why people take dietary supplements. According to data collected from the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), most regular users of supple ments state that they do so to maintain overall health, to sustain bone health, and to support heart health. Interestingly, the use of dietary supplements tends to increase with age, as recent research suggests that approximately 33% of those aged 20-39 take daily supplements while 67% of U.S. adults over the age of 60 do. The most common daily supplement? As of 2012, the National Insti tutes of Health reported that 31% of American adults take a full spectrum multivitamin/multimineral, with an essential fatty acid supplement (such as xEO Mega\u00ae) ranking as the most common \"specialty supplement\" at nearly 20%. This makes sense, as our concerns regarding bone and heart health tend to increase with the natural aging process and recent research suggests that full spectrum multivitamin/multimineral and omega-3 supplemen tation may be of benefit when addressing these issues. Designed to be the perfect complement to a balanced, whole food diet, LLV is a product that everybody should be familiar with. Consisting of Microplex VMz\u00ae Food Nutrient Complex, xEO Mega\u00ae Essential Oil Omega Complex, and Alpha CRS\u00ae Cellular Vitality Complex, LLV has a number of clinically supported health benefits. Accepted for publication in the Journal of Dietary Supplements, a two-month clinical trial showed that those who supplement their normal diet with LLV may experience significant improvements in several biomarkers of cardiovascular health, antioxidant status, inflammation levels, and blood glucose regulation.* Measured via blood sample, participants in the LLV clinical trial showed improvements in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, fasting insulin, and triglycerides.* Furthermore, they reported improved subjective measures of well-being, such as mental clarity, energy, motivation, and overall happiness.* While there is no ignoring that the foundation of health is a healthy, balanced, whole food diet, there are a few reasons we could all benefit by integrating LLV into our daily lives. NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as much as 95% of American adults do not meet recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for vitamins D and E, with approximately half of American adults also deficient in magnesium, vitamin A, calcium, and vitamin C. Even more alarming, as a side effect of the contemporary Western diet rich in highly processed foods, omega-6/ omega-3 ratio is typically 16:1 (or more) while recommendations suggest, for optimum health, that we aim for closer to 1:1. The best solution is to change dietary behaviors, but that is often much easier said than done. LLV with breakfast and an evening meal can be a convenient and cost-effective means to address this issue. CELLULAR HEALTH Research has shown that daily multivitamin supplementation may improve cellular health in otherwise healthy individuals. The Physician's Health Study II, a random ized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial involving nearly 15,000 participants over 14 years, found strong data to suggest that those who committed to daily supplementation 26 / FALL 2017 LIVING MAGAZINE* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

If you want to support health and well-being at the most fundamental level, there is evidence that daily supplementa tion is one way to do it. SUBJECTIVE MEASURES OF HEALTH Health isn't all about the numbers. Stress, energy levels, and genuine contentment are vitally important for our physical and emotional health. Several recent studies, including the LLV clinical trial, suggest that daily supplementation may improve these subjective measures of well-being. The first step toward a lifetime of health and vitality is toward the kitchen, but it isn't confined to what's in the refrigerator. On your way out of the kitchen, don't forget to visit the pantry, or wherever you have your LLV stored. There is no easier way to ensure that your cells have the essential nutrients and metabolic factors they need for daily optimal performance and for the rest of your life.

In continuing to grow its stake as the science leader in the essential oil industry, dTERRA is proud to announce that its scientists have published 17 studies in peer-reviewed scientific journals to date in the 2017 calendar year and several more are in various levels of completion. dTERRA Research Group Working closely with their rapidly growing list of over 140 medical facilities and research institutions, the dTERRA research group is committed to developing quality essential oils, discovering new models of use, and pursuing further understanding of how essential oils impart their health benefits. dTERRA science experts have employed a variety of analytical, biological, biochemical, and biomedical methodologies in examining essential oils in ways revolutionary within the industry. For instance, dTERRA is the first to produce peer-reviewed research examining the biological activity of many essential oils in a human skin model. As of yet, the list of examined essential oils ranges from Arborvitae to Vetiver, and many in between, and research involving all of the current lineup of CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade\u00ae oils is planned in the near future. BioMAP\u00ae System Much of the recently published research has employed the BioMAP HDF3CGF system, which uses a cell culture of human dermal fibroblasts (cells within the dermis layer of skin responsible for generating connective tissue and playing a primary role in tissue remodeling). This system consists of three components: the cell culture, a stimulus, and a set of biomarker (protein) readouts, which provide data about how doterra.com / 35 exposure to the outside stimuli (in this case, essential oils) influence the cell culture. Using this unique system allows dTERRA scientists to examine the activity of oils in vitro, but in an environment closely mimicking real human conditions. After growing the cell cultures, the cells are introduced to factors that induce activity in a way that parallels the changes occurring in cells found in a living person. Often, when foreign stimuli are introduced, fibroblasts multiply rapidly, which can lead to a change in the cellular composition of a tissue and have implications for its health and proper function. The fibroblasts themselves also secrete structural proteins into the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the space surrounding the cells. While these proteins are normally found in healthy individuals, an excess of ECM proteins can make a tissue that is normally flexible become rigid, a characteristic that can influence normal function. Using these protein biomarkers, dTERRA scientists are able to quantitatively analyze the rate of cell division, observe alterations in cellular metabolism, and examine other biological activities relevant to tissue remodeling, gene expression, and overall cellular health. The BioMAP system provides the ideal environment to investigate the why and the how regarding the health benefits provided by essential oils, and the dTERRA research group is excited about how the collected data can be used to progress current usage models.Ongoing Research While dTERRA scientists are specifically interested in the efficacy and safety of essential oils and their active components in topical applications, research involving aromatic use, nutritional supplements, and personal care products is also underway. Other recent publications have put the mood-enhancing properties of CPTG \u00ae Bergamot essential oil to the test\u2014in a very stressful environment\u2014and have examined the health benefits of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack \u00ae in a two-month long clinical trial. The work has just begun. So far we've looked at some of your favorite single CPTG essential oils and even at a dTERRA proprietary blend, exam ining their ability to promote protective cellular responses, support proper inflammatory responses, and induce healthy structural remodeling. The results are even more remarkable than we expected (hint, hint: Melaleuca showed a powerful ability to support tissue remodeling processes), providing further evidence of the power of volatile aromatic compounds in supporting various biomark - ers of health and showing why dTERRA CPTG essential oils are the most tested and the most trusted in the industry.
