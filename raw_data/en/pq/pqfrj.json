Vaccines remain the best tool we have to protect against hospitalization and death from COVID-19. We encourage all eligible patients to get the COVID-19 vaccine, which is widely available in Massachusetts. We also encourage those who are eligible for a booster shot to get one for added protection. Additionally, please continue to do your part by following these critical steps: - Follow state and local guidelines on masking and social distancing. - Practice good hand hygiene. - Get tested when symptomatic or after a possible exposure. Isolation & quarantine guidelines In early 2022, the CDC adjusted its guidance on how long individuals should quarantine or isolate after COVID-19 exposure or a positive test. [Mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/) and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) offer more detail on what to do in each scenario: COVID-19 Vaccinations at South Shore Health Massachusetts residents age 6 months old and older are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, with the appropriate vaccine depending on the age of the individual. South Shore Health encourages all eligible residents to get vaccinated. If you're eligible for a booster shot, we encourage you to receive your booster as well. The COVID-19 vaccine is widely available across Massachusetts \u2014 please use the state's [VaxFinder website](https://vaxfinder.mass.gov/) to find your nearest vaccination site. Learn more about the Moderna vaccine on [Moderna's website](https://eua.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/6m-5y-facts-recipient.pdf). Please note that this clinic is limited to patients ages 6 months through 4 years 11 months. Curious about the COVID-19 vaccine for children? Jeremy Warhaftig, MD and Richard Kauff, MD answered [questions from the public](/wellness/blog/pediatricians-answer-questions-about-covid-19-vaccine-children-ages-5-11). At South Shore Health, we believe the COVID-19 vaccine remains the most effective tool against preventing severe illness and death from the virus. We strongly encourage all eligible individuals that have not received their initial two-dose or single-dose vaccine to do so. In addition, booster doses are now available to [all Massachusetts residents age 16 years old and older](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-booster-frequently-asked-questions#eligibility-), provided that it has been six months since the completion of a two-dose vaccine series or two months since receiving the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. South Shore Health is not currently distributing third doses or booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. We encourage patients to receive a COVID-19 vaccine third dose or booster at their nearest vaccination site (including pharmacies and retail locations), which can be found by visiting the state's [VaxFinder website](https://vaxfinder.mass.gov/). We are keeping a close eye on how future state and federal guidance will apply to all patients and will update the South Shore community on a regular basis. Curious about the COVID-19 vaccine? [Simone Wildes, MD](/find-a-doctor/simone-s-wildes), infectious disease physician at South Shore Health, and [Todd Ellerin, MD](/find-a-doctor/todd-b-ellerin), Director of Infectious Disease at South Shore Health, got together to hold a roundtable discussion on a variety of topics relating to COVID-19 vaccines. You can view their question-and-answer sessions on the [South Shore Health YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqpXMZur2Zg&list=PL4PqtSkeUL0vVyJnS_x6huCZy8-lcFcFv&index=1). Information on COVID-19 Testing Multiple testing options are available for South Shore Medical Center patients who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. At-home testing Patients are encouraged to use at-home test kits whenever possible - test kits are reliable, widely available, and covered by most insurers. - Patients who test positive using an at-home kit should contact their care team for further assessment, including eligibility for prescription treatment. - Patients who test negative using an at-home kit should continue to monitor their symptoms and should contact their care team if symptoms worsen. Office or Telehealth Visits Patients who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms can schedule an office visit or telehealth visit with their care team for further evaluation and testing. Office visits, telehealth visits, and same-day appointments can be scheduled in South Shore MyChart. Patients without a MyChart account should call the Medical Center. Testing at Health Express South Shore Medical Center patients can also visit any [Health Express](https://www.southshorehealth.org/healthexpress/) location for a walk-in COVID test, no appointment required. Most medical insurers will cover the test if the individual is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms; patients should verify insurance coverage prior to getting tested. Find your [nearest Health Express location](https://www.southshorehealth.org/healthexpress/find-us). Health Express offers convenient access to COVID-19 testing at [all seven of its locations](/healthexpress/find-us). Testing options include the Abbott ID Now Rapid Molecular Test, which provides results in 15 minutes, and send-out PCR tests that provide results via Quest Diagnostics' secure portal within an estimated 72 hours. Upon arrival, patients will be evaluated by a Health Express provider and will then receive the appropriate test type for their situation. Please note that in some cases, test types may be limited based on available supply. - Appointments are not required for COVID-19 testing. - Medical insurance will cover the test if you are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. - If you do not have symptoms and need the test only for screening purposes, such as returning to school/work or for travel-related purposes, insurance will not cover the visit. Asymptomatic testing (i.e. travel or exposure) can only be performed by Quest Laboratories. - Patients should verify coverage with their insurer prior to getting tested. - The cost of the rapid PCR molecular test is $160.00, while the cost of the send-out PCR test is $180.00. Both fees include the exam by the provider and the test. Patients can still have a non-physician visit for Quest test. Find your [nearest Health Express](/healthexpress/find-us). At-home testing for COVID-19 using rapid antigen tests can be a great way to provide peace of mind after gathering with others outside your household, returning from travel, or a potential COVID-19 exposure. Rapid antigen tests can be conducted on your own, and most offer results in as little as 15 minutes. Learn more about [at-home COVID-19 testing](/wellness/blog/what-know-about-home-testing-covid-19). Additional Information for Our Community We continue to monitor the situation surrounding COVID-19 and will make adjustments to our visitor policies accordingly in order to keep our patients, visitors, and colleagues safe. For the guidance, including at South Shore Hospital, please see our [visitor policy](/about-us/news-media/news/south-shore-healths-visitor-policy) (last updated Feb. 2023). In early 2022, the CDC adjusted its guidance for quarantine and isolation after exposure to COVID-19 or after a confirmed positive test. If you had close contact with an individual who has COVID-19 or you tested positive yourself, you can find detailed information on how to proceed on Mass.gov: [How long do I isolate if I tested positive?](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/isolation-and-quarantine-guidance-for-the-general-public#if-you-test-positive-for-covid-19-(isolate)-) [What should I do if I had close contact with someone who tested positive?](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/isolation-and-quarantine-guidance-for-the-general-public#if-you-were-exposed-to-someone-with-covid-19-(quarantine)-) In addition, the CDC has a helpful guide that clarifies the difference between [quarantine and isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html). South Shore Medical Center providers and staff strongly believe that when you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Simply put, masks work best when everyone wears one. Individuals age 2 years old and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don't live in their household. To clarify our policy on this issue, South Shore Medical Center does not write mask exemption letters for either school or employment, except for: - Patients who have a disability impacting their executive function, who cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, for reasons related to the disability. This includes, but is not limited to, severe autism, advanced dementia, or genetic disorders resulting in significant cognitive impairment. - Patients for whom wearing a mask would create a risk to workplace health, safety, or job duty as determined by the workplace risk assessment. This policy is aligned with current CDC guidelines. We thank you for your cooperation and understanding. The recent surge in cases of COVID-19 has put tremendous strain on hospital resources throughout Massachusetts, including South Shore Hospital. As we continue in our effort to provide the appropriate level of care to all patients, we may occasionally need to transfer patients to another hospital, post-acute setting, or Alternate Care Site. In most cases, these transfers will occur due to a lack of appropriate space/staff or because a patient needs a different level of care than we are able to provide at the present time. If you or a member of your family is ill and visits the South Shore Hospital Emergency Department and a clinician determines you need to be hospitalized, you may be offered one of the following options: - You will be cared for at the hospital for the duration of your stay. - You will be transferred to another hospital. - You will be cared for at the hospital initially and then transferred to a specialized, fully staffed COVID-19 treatment facility in either Lowell or Worcester. - You will be cared for at the hospital initially and then transferred to our [Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program](/services-care/emergency-trauma/mobile-integrated-health)for continuation of your care at home. Additionally, for patients being discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis, the state has designated certain rules and locations for care in that setting. Our team can help educate you on these rules. Per Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) guidance, it is appropriate for hospitals to transfer a patient to another facility - regardless of whether or not the transfer is to a location of the patient's choosing. Patients have the right to reasonable transfer requests, such as a specific area or facility, and we will do what we can to accommodate those requests within reason. However, if we cannot accommodate those requests, it remains appropriate for the hospital to transfer the patient, even if the transfer site is not the patient's preferred location. All transfers will comply with discharge planning requirements. We recognize it's important for cancer patients to have a caregiver or loved one with them for support during treatment. However, to respond to the evolving COVID-19 situation, we have reviewed our visitor policy to protect the health and safety of our patients, visitors, and staff. We have enacted the following changes to our visitor policy at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center in clinical affiliation with South Shore Hospital: - Visitors are not allowed to accompany adult patients, with very limited exceptions. - All people entering the Cancer Center will be screened for symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, sore throat, body aches, or rash. - Patients who have symptoms of a cold of flu should call their provider before arrival. - Patients must use the main entrance, with the second-floor entrance accessible to Cancer Center providers and staff only. Additionally, the Cancer Center is now screening EMS transfers coming in, including patients and the EMS staff, while also decontaminating stretchers. We appreciate your understanding and adherence to these changes. We will continue to make adjustments to our policies and procedures as needed so that we can maintain excellent care for our patients.
