For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending. I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation. Additionally, the majority of people I see are on one or more pharmaceuticals. This brings up the question of how herbal medicine and conventional drugs interact with each other. I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms.HOLDING TO OUR ROOTS Many of our longstanding customers know that we have a deeply embedded tradition of protecting and enhancing our biological communities and prioritizing the protection of at-risk plants. We led the charge in the 90s by emphasizing sustainable wildharvesting and, today, we refuse to offer botanicals that are overharvested. In some cases, we have abruptly discontinued a product because continuing to sell that botanical would compromise its status in the wild. This explains why you may have noticed that a former product is no longer available. We work closely with United Plant Savers (UpS), which gives us the guidance necessary to make informed decisions when it comes to the most delicate and sensitive species. Our partnership is bringing about exciting cultivation programs for several of these at-risk botanicals, which will ultimately relieve stress on the wild plant communities by shielding them from harvest. We have always been driven by a desire to do business carefully and consciously and, most importantly, with the plants' and the planet's best interests at the forefront. We promise to continue this important work. With that in mind, this Mountain Rose Herbs Journal focuses on the protection of our wild and at-risk plants. I hope you will become involved with the protection of our natural world. One good way is to become a member of UpS. Visit unitedplantsavers.org for more information. Onwards!

Our goal is to create a community, one based on an all-inclusive spirit and rooted in the ancient traditions that humans have turned to for millennia: in the profoundly healing beauty of nature and the natural gifts of the botanical world. Thank you for joining us. While herbal medicine has never stopped being practiced throughout many cultures, the 1960's-born herbal medicine revival in the United States is the door I came through. I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending. I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation. Additionally, the majority of people I see are on one or more pharmaceuticals. This brings up the question of how herbal medicine and conventional drugs interact with each other. I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms.047SONG: AN HERBALIST'S JOURNEY We all come to herbalism from a dierent place along a unique and personal path. 7Song, founder of the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine, shares his journey.06 EAST ASIAN MEDICINAL HERBS FOR NOURISHING SOUPS Transition into the restful yin season of autumn and winter with nourishing soups loaded with hearty East Asian medicinal herbs.12 AT-RISK & ENDANGERED PLANTS: WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP?

I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car).

I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation. Additionally, the majority of people I see are on one or more pharmaceuticals. This brings up the question of how herbal medicine and conventional drugs interact with each other. I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms.While herbal medicine has never stopped being practiced throughout many cultures, the 1960's-born herbal medicine revival in the United States is the door I came through. I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending.

If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. We visited 7Song in June 2022 to film short documentaries about his life and the Ithaca Free Clinic. Scan here to get an inside look at 7Song's herbal practice in Ithaca, NY.

I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms. 10While herbal medicine has never stopped being practiced throughout many cultures, the 1960's-born herbal medicine revival in the United States is the door I came through. I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending. I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation.

JILING LIN WRITTEN BY As the days shorten, plants send their energy to their roots and go to seed, while deciduous trees shed their leaves. We cozy up in warmer clothes, stack firewood, and start storing up our food and energy reserves for the winter. In autumn, we transition from the more active yang seasons of spring and summer into the more restful yin seasons of autumn and winter. We too send our energies underground, sleeping and eating more, and moving and doing less. In autumn, we bundle, store, and prepare for the more fallow winter season ahead, when the world rests. Soup is perfect for welcoming autumn! Enjoy warm nourishing soups medicinally loaded with a hearty herbal base. Slow-cook over the stovetop or in a crockpot with your favorite proteins and veggies. Here are some of my favorite Chinese medicinals to enrich nourishing stews. EAST ASIAN MEDICINAL HERBS FOR NOURISHING SOUPSASTRAGALUS ROOT (Astragalus membranaceus, Fabaceae. Huang Qi) Astragalus is included in East Asian medicine formulas to tonify Qi and Blood, boost energy, strengthen immunity*, and nourish internal resilience to withstand unwanted environmental factors. Throw 6-12 astragalus root slices into your stews, allowing them to simmer and decoct for at least 30 minutes. Remove astragalus before serving, and enjoy the slightly sweet, gently warming, and lightly moistening broth with a dash of fresh ginger, some mushrooms, and your protein of choice. Native to China, Mongolia, and North Korea, astragalus grows in grassy environments and mountainsides with abundant sun exposure and dry sandy soil with good drainage. Astragalus is an herbaceous perennial, growing between 25 and 40 centimeters in height, with small yellow pea-family flowers that bees and other pollinators adore. When grown for cultivation, the plants are traditionally harvested after four or five years, with the roots collected in spring or fall. The roots are dried in the sun then sliced for distribution. The slices are light yellow with a firm, fibrous texture. If you're already ill or are taking immunosuppressant medications, then check with your healthcare practitioner first before working with astragalus. SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS (Lentinula edodes, Marasmiaceae. Xiang Gu) umami flavor, meat-like texture, and malleability, shiitake is a staple in our vegan Taiwanese-American household. Alongside ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, we stir-fry, soup, sauce, and enjoy shiitake in a variety of ways. Keep a jar of dried shiitake easily accessible in your kitchen cabinet. Rehydrate for 10 minutes, then either slice thinly for stir-fries or add whole into soups. Fresh shiitake is delicious too, and is available at some groceries, or can be cultivated in forest-style gardens. A balancing and nourishing adaptogen, shiitake is native to warm and moist parts of Southeast Asia, growing in clumps on the decaying wood of deciduous trees. Shiitake has a dark cap that dries into black, and an earthy aroma. Rich in vitamins, polysaccharides, and protein, shiitakes are delicious thinly sliced in miso soup, cooked at length in nourishing broths, and tossed into stir-fries. GINGER RHIZOME (Zingiber officinale, Zingiberacae. Sheng Jiang) Ginger rhizome also lives on our kitchen counter, a star herb in most Taiwanese and Chinese culinary dishes. Throw large ginger slices into cooking and remove before serving, or finely chop and grate ginger into stir-fries for small bursts of flavor. Fresh ginger is available in most grocery stores, while dried or powdered ginger is convenient to keep on hand. Acrid, warming, and drying, ginger is a digestive and circulatory stimulant commonly included in most East Asian medicine formulas. Ginger ranges in function from \"king herb\" to, more commonly, an \"envoy\" or supporting herb. Gan jiang is the older winter ginger rhizome, which is hotter and more drying. Shen jiang is the fresh, young, and tender ginger rhizome, which is warmer and more moistening. Ginger is a tropical, aromatic, perennial herb that is likely native to tropical Asia but has been cultivated for so long that the exact origins are unclear. A zesty and warming spice, ginger root has been used to flavor culinary dishes and beverages for millennia, with the first recorded uses found in ancient Sanskrit and Chinese texts. It has also been utilized in Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Unani Tibb traditional medicine practices and is now a widely known herb in most parts of the world. GOJI BERRIES (Lycium Barbarum, Solanaceae. Gou Qi Zi) A small handful of goji berries add a bit of sweet nourishment to soups, alongside astragalus and jujube dates (Ziziphus jujuba, Rhamnaceae. da zao). Tossed in at the end of stir-fries, goji berries can add a little sweet kick, color burst, and nutrient boost. Lycium barbarum is a deciduous, woody tree with simple leaves and a prickly stem. A common species of the genus Lycium that is found in lowland areas across Asia, goji berries are also known as lycii berries, or wolfberries, with some interchangeable species. Goji berries are a bright red, chewy berry with a lightly sweet taste, neutral energetics, and a slightly moistening quality. In Chinese medicine, they enrich Yin, nourish Blood, and mildly tonify Yang. Enjoy raw, steeped as tea, or incorporated into culinary recipes such as trail mix or nourishing autumn stews. If you're sensitive to nightshade family (Solanaceae) plants or are already sick, then please consult with your healthcare practitioner prior to use. DONG QUAI ROOT (Angelica sinensis, Apiacae. Dang Gui) Dong quai has a very specific flavor. \"Too medicinal,\" says my husband, making a face. So, I usually enjoy dong quai-based soups solo. I love dong quai's sweet, acrid, and warm flavors. In Chinese medicine, dong quai tonifies and gently invigorates the blood, lightly moistening dryness, nourishing deficiency, and moving stagnation. Dong quai is often employed in Chinese herbal formulas to support female reproductive health. Dong quai soup is famously blended with chicken, ginger, goji berries, shiitake mushrooms, jujube dates, soy sauce, and sesame oil for a nourishing and supportive Taiwanese postpartum soup. Substitute tofu or another protein for the chicken. For a basic stew, add 3-10 dried slices and decoct with your stew for at least 30 minutes. Remove roots before serving. A small perennial, dong quai grows up to three feet in height. It is native to high-altitude regions of China and Japan, growing best in cold, damp areas. It produces small clusters of white flowers and is extensively cultivated for its roots, which are harvested in autumn. Do not use dong quai during pregnancy or with blood-thinning medications, unless supervised by a qualified healthcare practitioner.KOMBU SEAWEED (Saccharina latissima, Laminariaceae. \u081b Kun Bu) Growing up, Ma kept long strands of thick kombu under her table, alongside big metal popcorn tins filled with beans, rice, and other dry essentials. Easy to keep and easy to cook, kombu welcomes a slightly salty and oceanic flavor and energy to otherwise common meals. Cook with daikon, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, potatoes, other hearty vegetables, and your favorite proteins. Lightly wash kombu with cool water, cutting or breaking it into thumb-sized pieces that will fit nicely into a pot. Soak for five minutes, then add close to the end of cooking your stew. Salty and cold, kombu \"softens areas of hardness\" by mobilizing fluid metabolism*. There are more elaborate preparations, but cutting and tossing kombu into soups is easy and delicious. Kombu also makes a delicious soup stock, soaked in either cold or hot water for at least one hour, then strained. Kombu is a brown seaweed found in sheltered rocky seabeds in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Ecologically, kombu is an important part of the coastal food web, providing food and habitat for sea animals. This edible kelp is widely savored in eastern Asia and is one of the main ingredients in dashi, a Japanese soup stock. Kombu is extensively cultivated on ropes in the seas of Japan and Korea. If you have fish or shellfish allergies, then do not consume kombu. Consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner before using herbal products, particularly if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medications. IN CLOSING Add ginger rhizome, shiitake mushrooms, seaweed into your autumn and winter stews. Hold a warm bowl of stew in your hands, watch the steam, and savor the flavors. Welcome nourishment and allow yourself to slow down into the darker seasons, savoring simplicity. Enjoy! While herbal medicine has never stopped being practiced throughout many cultures, the 1960's-born herbal medicine revival in the United States is the door I came through. I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending. I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation. Additionally, the majority of people I see are on one or more pharmaceuticals. This brings up the question of how herbal medicine and conventional drugs interact with each other. I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms.As the days shorten, plants send their energy to their roots and go to seed, while deciduous trees shed their leaves. We cozy up in warmer clothes, stack firewood, and start storing up our food and energy reserves for the winter. In autumn, we transition from the more active yang seasons of spring and summer into the more restful yin seasons of autumn and winter. We too send our energies underground, sleeping and eating more, and moving and doing less. In autumn, we bundle, store, and prepare for the more fallow winter season ahead, when the world rests. Soup is perfect for welcoming autumn! Enjoy warm nourishing soups medicinally loaded with a hearty herbal base. Slow-cook over the stovetop or in a crockpot with your favorite proteins and veggies. Here are some of my favorite Chinese medicinals to enrich nourishing stews. ASTRAGALUS ROOT (Astragalus membranaceus, Fabaceae. Huang Qi) Astragalus is included in East Asian medicine formulas to tonify Qi and Blood, boost energy, strengthen immunity*, and nourish internal resilience to withstand unwanted environmental factors. Throw 6-12 astragalus root slices into your stews, allowing them to simmer and decoct for at least 30 minutes. Remove astragalus before serving, and enjoy the slightly sweet, gently warming, and lightly moistening broth with a dash of fresh ginger, some mushrooms, and your protein of choice. Native to China, Mongolia, and North Korea, astragalus grows in grassy environments and mountainsides with abundant sun exposure and dry sandy soil with good drainage. Astragalus is an herbaceous perennial, growing between 25 and 40 centimeters in height, with small yellow pea-family flowers that bees and other pollinators adore. When grown for cultivation, the plants are traditionally harvested after four or five years, with the roots collected in spring or fall. The roots are dried in the sun then sliced for distribution. The slices are light yellow with a firm, fibrous texture. If you're already ill or are taking immunosuppressant medications, then check with your healthcare practitioner first before working with astragalus. SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS (Lentinula edodes, Marasmiaceae. Xiang Gu) umami flavor, meat-like texture, and malleability, shiitake is a staple in our vegan Taiwanese-American household. Alongside ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, we stir-fry, soup, sauce, and enjoy shiitake in a variety of ways. Keep a jar of dried shiitake easily accessible in your kitchen cabinet. Rehydrate for 10 minutes, then either slice thinly for stir-fries or add whole into soups. Fresh shiitake is delicious too, and is available at some groceries, or can be cultivated in forest-style gardens. A balancing and nourishing adaptogen, shiitake is native to warm and moist parts of Southeast Asia, growing in clumps on the decaying wood of deciduous trees. Shiitake has a dark cap that dries into black, and an earthy aroma. Rich in vitamins, polysaccharides, and protein, shiitakes are delicious thinly sliced in miso soup, cooked at length in nourishing broths, and tossed into stir-fries. GINGER RHIZOME (Zingiber officinale, Zingiberacae. Sheng Jiang) Ginger rhizome also lives on our kitchen counter, a star herb in most Taiwanese and Chinese culinary dishes. Throw large ginger slices into cooking and remove before serving, or finely chop and grate ginger into stir-fries for small bursts of flavor. Fresh ginger is available in most grocery stores, while dried or powdered ginger is convenient to keep on hand. Acrid, warming, and drying, ginger is a digestive and circulatory stimulant commonly included in most East Asian medicine formulas. Ginger ranges in function from \"king herb\" to, more commonly, an \"envoy\" or supporting herb. Gan jiang is the older winter ginger rhizome, which is hotter and more drying. Shen jiang is the fresh, young, and tender ginger rhizome, which is warmer and more moistening.

Alongside ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, we stir-fry, soup, sauce, and enjoy shiitake in a variety of ways. Keep a jar of dried shiitake easily accessible in your kitchen cabinet. Rehydrate for 10 minutes, then either slice thinly for stir-fries or add whole into soups. Fresh shiitake is delicious too, and is available at some groceries, or can be cultivated in forest-style gardens. A balancing and nourishing adaptogen, shiitake is native to warm and moist parts of Southeast Asia, growing in clumps on the decaying wood of deciduous trees. Shiitake has a dark cap that dries into black, and an earthy aroma. Rich in vitamins, polysaccharides, and protein, shiitakes are delicious thinly sliced in miso soup, cooked at length in nourishing broths, and tossed into stir-fries. GINGER RHIZOME (Zingiber officinale, Zingiberacae. Sheng Jiang) Ginger rhizome also lives on our kitchen counter, a star herb in most Taiwanese and Chinese culinary dishes. Throw large ginger slices into cooking and remove before serving, or finely chop and grate ginger into stir-fries for small bursts of flavor. Fresh ginger is available in most grocery stores, while dried or powdered ginger is convenient to keep on hand. Acrid, warming, and drying, ginger is a digestive and circulatory stimulant commonly included in most East Asian medicine formulas. Ginger ranges in function from \"king herb\" to, more commonly, an \"envoy\" or supporting herb. Gan jiang is the older winter ginger rhizome, which is hotter and more drying. Shen jiang is the fresh, young, and tender ginger rhizome, which is warmer and more moistening. Ginger is a tropical, aromatic, perennial herb that is likely native to tropical Asia but has been cultivated for so long that the exact origins are unclear. A zesty and warming spice, ginger root has been used to flavor culinary dishes and beverages for millennia, with the first recorded uses found in ancient Sanskrit and Chinese texts. It has also been utilized in Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Unani Tibb traditional medicine practices and is now a widely known herb in most parts of the world. GOJI BERRIES (Lycium Barbarum, Solanaceae. Gou Qi Zi) A small handful of goji berries add a bit of sweet nourishment to soups, alongside astragalus and jujube dates (Ziziphus jujuba, Rhamnaceae. da zao). Tossed in at the end of stir-fries, goji berries can add a little sweet kick, color burst, and nutrient boost. Lycium barbarum is a deciduous, woody tree with simple leaves and a prickly stem. A common species of the genus Lycium that is found in lowland areas across Asia, goji berries are also known as lycii berries, or wolfberries, with some interchangeable species. Goji berries are a bright red, chewy berry with a lightly sweet taste, neutral energetics, and a slightly moistening quality. In Chinese medicine, they enrich Yin, nourish Blood, and mildly tonify Yang. Enjoy raw, steeped as tea, or incorporated into culinary recipes such as trail mix or nourishing autumn stews. If you're sensitive to nightshade family (Solanaceae) plants or are already sick, then please consult with your healthcare practitioner prior to use. DONG QUAI ROOT (Angelica sinensis, Apiacae. Dang Gui) Dong quai has a very specific flavor. \"Too medicinal,\" says my husband, making a face. So, I usually enjoy dong quai-based soups solo. I love dong quai's sweet, acrid, and warm flavors. In Chinese medicine, dong quai tonifies and gently invigorates the blood, lightly moistening dryness, nourishing deficiency, and moving stagnation. Dong quai is often employed in Chinese herbal formulas to support female reproductive health. Dong quai soup is famously blended with chicken, ginger, goji berries, shiitake mushrooms, jujube dates, soy sauce, and sesame oil for a nourishing and supportive Taiwanese postpartum soup. Substitute tofu or another protein for the chicken. For a basic stew, add 3-10 dried slices and decoct with your stew for at least 30 minutes. Remove roots before serving. A small perennial, dong quai grows up to three feet in height. It is native to high-altitude regions of China and Japan, growing best in cold, damp areas. It produces small clusters of white flowers and is extensively cultivated for its roots, which are harvested in autumn. Do not use dong quai during pregnancy or with blood-thinning medications, unless supervised by a qualified healthcare practitioner.KOMBU SEAWEED (Saccharina latissima, Laminariaceae. \u081b Kun Bu) Growing up, Ma kept long strands of thick kombu under her table, alongside big metal popcorn tins filled with beans, rice, and other dry essentials. Easy to keep and easy to cook, kombu welcomes a slightly salty and oceanic flavor and energy to otherwise common meals. Cook with daikon, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, potatoes, other hearty vegetables, and your favorite proteins. Lightly wash kombu with cool water, cutting or breaking it into thumb-sized pieces that will fit nicely into a pot. Soak for five minutes, then add close to the end of cooking your stew. Salty and cold, kombu \"softens areas of hardness\" by mobilizing fluid metabolism*. There are more elaborate preparations, but cutting and tossing kombu into soups is easy and delicious. Kombu also makes a delicious soup stock, soaked in either cold or hot water for at least one hour, then strained. Kombu is a brown seaweed found in sheltered rocky seabeds in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Ecologically, kombu is an important part of the coastal food web, providing food and habitat for sea animals. This edible kelp is widely savored in eastern Asia and is one of the main ingredients in dashi, a Japanese soup stock. Kombu is extensively cultivated on ropes in the seas of Japan and Korea. If you have fish or shellfish allergies, then do not consume kombu. Consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner before using herbal products, particularly if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medications. IN CLOSING Add ginger rhizome, shiitake mushrooms, seaweed into your autumn and winter stews. Hold a warm bowl of stew in your hands, watch the steam, and savor the flavors. Welcome nourishment and allow yourself to slow down into the darker seasons, savoring simplicity. Enjoy! MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 15While herbal medicine has never stopped being practiced throughout many cultures, the 1960's-born herbal medicine revival in the United States is the door I came through. I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending. I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation. Additionally, the majority of people I see are on one or more pharmaceuticals. This brings up the question of how herbal medicine and conventional drugs interact with each other. I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms.As the days shorten, plants send their energy to their roots and go to seed, while deciduous trees shed their leaves. We cozy up in warmer clothes, stack firewood, and start storing up our food and energy reserves for the winter. In autumn, we transition from the more active yang seasons of spring and summer into the more restful yin seasons of autumn and winter. We too send our energies underground, sleeping and eating more, and moving and doing less. In autumn, we bundle, store, and prepare for the more fallow winter season ahead, when the world rests. Soup is perfect for welcoming autumn! Enjoy warm nourishing soups medicinally loaded with a hearty herbal base. Slow-cook over the stovetop or in a crockpot with your favorite proteins and veggies. Here are some of my favorite Chinese medicinals to enrich nourishing stews. ASTRAGALUS ROOT (Astragalus membranaceus, Fabaceae. Huang Qi) Astragalus is included in East Asian medicine formulas to tonify Qi and Blood, boost energy, strengthen immunity*, and nourish internal resilience to withstand unwanted environmental factors. Throw 6-12 astragalus root slices into your stews, allowing them to simmer and decoct for at least 30 minutes. Remove astragalus before serving, and enjoy the slightly sweet, gently warming, and lightly moistening broth with a dash of fresh ginger, some mushrooms, and your protein of choice. Native to China, Mongolia, and North Korea, astragalus grows in grassy environments and mountainsides with abundant sun exposure and dry sandy soil with good drainage. Astragalus is an herbaceous perennial, growing between 25 and 40 centimeters in height, with small yellow pea-family flowers that bees and other pollinators adore. When grown for cultivation, the plants are traditionally harvested after four or five years, with the roots collected in spring or fall. The roots are dried in the sun then sliced for distribution. The slices are light yellow with a firm, fibrous texture. If you're already ill or are taking immunosuppressant medications, then check with your healthcare practitioner first before working with astragalus. SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS (Lentinula edodes, Marasmiaceae. Xiang Gu) umami flavor, meat-like texture, and malleability, shiitake is a staple in our vegan Taiwanese-American household. Alongside ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, we stir-fry, soup, sauce, and enjoy shiitake in a variety of ways. Keep a jar of dried shiitake easily accessible in your kitchen cabinet.

Soup is perfect for welcoming autumn! Enjoy warm nourishing soups medicinally loaded with a hearty herbal base. Slow-cook over the stovetop or in a crockpot with your favorite proteins and veggies. Here are some of my favorite Chinese medicinals to enrich nourishing stews. ASTRAGALUS ROOT (Astragalus membranaceus, Fabaceae. Huang Qi) Astragalus is included in East Asian medicine formulas to tonify Qi and Blood, boost energy, strengthen immunity*, and nourish internal resilience to withstand unwanted environmental factors. Throw 6-12 astragalus root slices into your stews, allowing them to simmer and decoct for at least 30 minutes. Remove astragalus before serving, and enjoy the slightly sweet, gently warming, and lightly moistening broth with a dash of fresh ginger, some mushrooms, and your protein of choice. Native to China, Mongolia, and North Korea, astragalus grows in grassy environments and mountainsides with abundant sun exposure and dry sandy soil with good drainage. Astragalus is an herbaceous perennial, growing between 25 and 40 centimeters in height, with small yellow pea-family flowers that bees and other pollinators adore. When grown for cultivation, the plants are traditionally harvested after four or five years, with the roots collected in spring or fall. The roots are dried in the sun then sliced for distribution. The slices are light yellow with a firm, fibrous texture. If you're already ill or are taking immunosuppressant medications, then check with your healthcare practitioner first before working with astragalus. SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS (Lentinula edodes, Marasmiaceae. Xiang Gu) umami flavor, meat-like texture, and malleability, shiitake is a staple in our vegan Taiwanese-American household. Alongside ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, we stir-fry, soup, sauce, and enjoy shiitake in a variety of ways. Keep a jar of dried shiitake easily accessible in your kitchen cabinet. Rehydrate for 10 minutes, then either slice thinly for stir-fries or add whole into soups. Fresh shiitake is delicious too, and is available at some groceries, or can be cultivated in forest-style gardens. A balancing and nourishing adaptogen, shiitake is native to warm and moist parts of Southeast Asia, growing in clumps on the decaying wood of deciduous trees. Shiitake has a dark cap that dries into black, and an earthy aroma. Rich in vitamins, polysaccharides, and protein, shiitakes are delicious thinly sliced in miso soup, cooked at length in nourishing broths, and tossed into stir-fries. GINGER RHIZOME (Zingiber officinale, Zingiberacae. Sheng Jiang) Ginger rhizome also lives on our kitchen counter, a star herb in most Taiwanese and Chinese culinary dishes. Throw large ginger slices into cooking and remove before serving, or finely chop and grate ginger into stir-fries for small bursts of flavor. Fresh ginger is available in most grocery stores, while dried or powdered ginger is convenient to keep on hand. Acrid, warming, and drying, ginger is a digestive and circulatory stimulant commonly included in most East Asian medicine formulas. Ginger ranges in function from \"king herb\" to, more commonly, an \"envoy\" or supporting herb. Gan jiang is the older winter ginger rhizome, which is hotter and more drying. Shen jiang is the fresh, young, and tender ginger rhizome, which is warmer and more moistening. Ginger is a tropical, aromatic, perennial herb that is likely native to tropical Asia but has been cultivated for so long that the exact origins are unclear. A zesty and warming spice, ginger root has been used to flavor culinary dishes and beverages for millennia, with the first recorded uses found in ancient Sanskrit and Chinese texts. It has also been utilized in Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Unani Tibb traditional medicine practices and is now a widely known herb in most parts of the world. GOJI BERRIES (Lycium Barbarum, Solanaceae. Gou Qi Zi) A small handful of goji berries add a bit of sweet nourishment to soups, alongside astragalus and jujube dates (Ziziphus jujuba, Rhamnaceae. da zao). Tossed in at the end of stir-fries, goji berries can add a little sweet kick, color burst, and nutrient boost. Lycium barbarum is a deciduous, woody tree with simple leaves and a prickly stem. A common species of the genus Lycium that is found in lowland areas across Asia, goji berries are also known as lycii berries, or wolfberries, with some interchangeable species. Goji berries are a bright red, chewy berry with a lightly sweet taste, neutral energetics, and a slightly moistening quality. In Chinese medicine, they enrich Yin, nourish Blood, and mildly tonify Yang. Enjoy raw, steeped as tea, or incorporated into culinary recipes such as trail mix or nourishing autumn stews. If you're sensitive to nightshade family (Solanaceae) plants or are already sick, then please consult with your healthcare practitioner prior to use. DONG QUAI ROOT (Angelica sinensis, Apiacae. Dang Gui) Dong quai has a very specific flavor. \"Too medicinal,\" says my husband, making a face. So, I usually enjoy dong quai-based soups solo. I love dong quai's sweet, acrid, and warm flavors. In Chinese medicine, dong quai tonifies and gently invigorates the blood, lightly moistening dryness, nourishing deficiency, and moving stagnation. Dong quai is often employed in Chinese herbal formulas to support female reproductive health. Dong quai soup is famously blended with chicken, ginger, goji berries, shiitake mushrooms, jujube dates, soy sauce, and sesame oil for a nourishing and supportive Taiwanese postpartum soup. Substitute tofu or another protein for the chicken. For a basic stew, add 3-10 dried slices and decoct with your stew for at least 30 minutes. Remove roots before serving. A small perennial, dong quai grows up to three feet in height. It is native to high-altitude regions of China and Japan, growing best in cold, damp areas. It produces small clusters of white flowers and is extensively cultivated for its roots, which are harvested in autumn. Do not use dong quai during pregnancy or with blood-thinning medications, unless supervised by a qualified healthcare practitioner.KOMBU SEAWEED (Saccharina latissima, Laminariaceae. \u081b Kun Bu) Growing up, Ma kept long strands of thick kombu under her table, alongside big metal popcorn tins filled with beans, rice, and other dry essentials. Easy to keep and easy to cook, kombu welcomes a slightly salty and oceanic flavor and energy to otherwise common meals. Cook with daikon, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, potatoes, other hearty vegetables, and your favorite proteins. Lightly wash kombu with cool water, cutting or breaking it into thumb-sized pieces that will fit nicely into a pot. Soak for five minutes, then add close to the end of cooking your stew. Salty and cold, kombu \"softens areas of hardness\" by mobilizing fluid metabolism*. There are more elaborate preparations, but cutting and tossing kombu into soups is easy and delicious. Kombu also makes a delicious soup stock, soaked in either cold or hot water for at least one hour, then strained. Kombu is a brown seaweed found in sheltered rocky seabeds in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Ecologically, kombu is an important part of the coastal food web, providing food and habitat for sea animals. This edible kelp is widely savored in eastern Asia and is one of the main ingredients in dashi, a Japanese soup stock. Kombu is extensively cultivated on ropes in the seas of Japan and Korea. If you have fish or shellfish allergies, then do not consume kombu. Consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner before using herbal products, particularly if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medications. IN CLOSING Add ginger rhizome, shiitake mushrooms, seaweed into your autumn and winter stews. Hold a warm bowl of stew in your hands, watch the steam, and savor the flavors. Welcome nourishment and allow yourself to slow down into the darker seasons, savoring simplicity. Enjoy! *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 17While herbal medicine has never stopped being practiced throughout many cultures, the 1960's-born herbal medicine revival in the United States is the door I came through. I certainly did not grow up thinking about being an herbalist. But then again, I really had no idea what I would do with my life as an adult. I have always had a naturalistic zeal and enjoy categorizing the various parts of nature that I encounter, including plants, insects, and other animals. My first science was astronomy, and then I became interested in herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians. I grew up in the heart of suburban New York, where there was not much nature to explore. Fortunately, there were still small stretches of woods between the houses and the highways, where I would find salamanders, frogs, and other critters. My nature studies fell by the wayside during my teenage years as I tried to navigate all the awkwardness inside and outside my head. This was the mid-1970s and alternative education was nowhere to be found where I lived. I dropped out of high school and got my GED a few years later. We now arrive in the late 1970s, which leads to my sad but true first adventure in gathering wild plants. I had a small booklet that listed plants that supposedly get you high. For some reason, I knew how to identify one tree by its unique aroma. So a friend and I went into the aforementioned woods and gathered a few very young trees, roots and all, and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Cougar (a horribly uncomfortable sporty car). The sad thing is we never did anything with the plants, and they just dried out. It would be a few years before I gathered plants again\u2014by then I would learn to be more considerate. In 1981 I moved to Santa Cruz, California, to get my metaphorical hippie card stamped. This brought me to my first herbal education experience. I saw notices for the 'Platonic Academy of Herbal Studies' and was intrigued. So, I arranged to take classes in exchange for bringing baked goods for the teachers. (Yes, really.) A friend and I were making cookies and selling them at a local shop (I still have the handwritten sign if you need proof). The teacher who most influenced me was Christopher Hobbs, who taught botany, a subject I have been studying ever since. And so, this lesser-known herbal school was my starting point to learn about plants and herbal medicine. That same year I drove north to the Oregon Country Fair and came across a booth for the California School of Herbal Studies (CSHS). They had a photo album out showing colorfully clad herb students looking like they were enjoying themselves. The booth and photo album strongly piqued my interest. I eventually sent in an application looking to do a work-study with the school. So, in 1983, I began my herbal education in earnest at the CSHS, which, at the time, was run by Rosemary Gladstar. As a bit of foreshadowing, I have been teaching regularly at that school for over 20 years now. My time at the CSHS catapulted me into wanting to understand the complexity and remedial properties of herbal medicine. I also started meeting 'herb people' and developing an herbal community. This school opened the plant medicine door for me. Sometime in the mid-1980s, a new phenomenon\u2014herbal conferences\u2014started sprouting up. I attended them whenever they were in the Northeast U.S. where I was then living. These gatherings\u2014such as the GreenNations Gathering and the Gaia Herbal Symposium\u2014were significant to my growth as an herbalist, and I would often help out in exchange for attending. I joined the classes with a two-fold purpose: obviously to learn about herbs, but nearly as important, I wanted to learn more about teaching. I would search out different teachers with different teaching approaches. If I enjoyed their style and thought I could emulate it, I went to a few of their classes and tried to decipher what I liked about their teaching skill and how I could incorporate them. In 1993, I went on a backroads cross-country trip with a friend. Along the way, we visited Michael Moore at his school, The Southwest School of Botanical Medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I convinced him to let me teach botany. When I first started teaching, I thought my heart would explode as I was so nervous teaching this group of well-informed students. But I eventually calmed down and got better at it. My herbal medicine and knowledge grew exponentially with Michael in the two years I studied with him. His teaching informs a lot of my current clinical practice, and some of the ways I teach are anchored by Michael's skill as an educator. I appreciated his non-reductionist scientific approach to herbal medicine. Invigorated with a bona fide teaching experience, I started reaching out to herbal conferences to teach, which in turn helped me gain further offers to teach at other schools and herbal symposia. This also opened up my herbal networks. In 1994, I started the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine in Ithaca, New York, which continues to this day (a startling 28 years). Running a school and being the primary teacher requires continual self-reflection. There are many teaching styles, and I continue to refine my own. There is also the constant reevaluation of material, as there are continual changes in the sciences that necessitate incorporating new material and discarding inaccurate information. In 2005, an herbalist friend told me about meetings she was attending where people from multiple health disciplines were working to set up a free clinic in Ithaca. Being my usual cynical self, I didn't really believe such a thing could happen. Still, she persisted, and I finally went and was astonished to find that it was true. One of the most satisfying projects I've ever been a part of is the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC). There were usually 10-15 people in those early meetings, including doctors, nurses, herbalists, massage therapists, and employees from the local hospital. There were only a few of us 'holistic' practitioners present, but from the beginning, our voices were generally respected, even by the more orthodox practitioners. There were a lot of meetings. I was a part of the clinical committee, which focused on what clinical practice would look like at the free clinic. Attending these meetings gave me a greater insight into our current medical system and trying to suss out different ways for people to get their health needs met. People ask me how we were able to bring the clinic together. One of the main reasons was that participants let go of their personal ideals and compromised as needed. This was crucial as most of us came in with a vision of what the clinic would look like, which might have clashed with other people's ideals. We focused on the goal of making the clinic a reality, so continually cooperated to bring it to completion. Most of the people involved were locals who had lived in Ithaca for a long time and were very committed to the community. They stayed involved for the time it took to work through all the details. In one of our final meetings, there was a vote about whether or not to allow herbalists to practice at the clinic. While the three of us had been an integral part of the process since the early days, there was still concern because there is no licensing or standardized education for herbalists. A few of the more conventional practitioners thought herbalists practicing herbal medicine could cause a liability for the clinic. This was a valid concern. The vote was whether to give us a 3-month evaluation period. So, we went into another room and waited with some trepidation as the vote was taken. The outcome was seventeen for and one against, and hence, there have always been herbalists working at the clinic. We opened the clinic doors in January of 2006, and I have been working there ever since. As I write this, we have just passed our 16th year in operation, including this challenging time with Covid. While the roster occasionally changes, the clinic usually hosts conventional medicine (MD, NP, PA, nurse), herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy, insurance facilitation, and networking with other local services. Along with being a clinical herbalist, I am also the Director of Holistic Medicine, which frankly does not entail much, but every once in a long while, I will give a talk about the holistic services at the clinic. Over the years, I have seen hundreds of people. It can be challenging, and I have to continually study, especially pathophysiology, disease, and medications. Most of the people I see at the clinic are new to herbal medicine. This has to be taken into account to help individuals feel comfortable with this \"new\" type of medicine and consultation. Additionally, the majority of people I see are on one or more pharmaceuticals. This brings up the question of how herbal medicine and conventional drugs interact with each other. I use herbal remedies cautiously depending on the pharmaceutical and the underlying pathology. I offer consultations and herbal medicine for free to patients at the IFC. Running the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine allows me to offer this by providing me with enough income to live and supply free herbal support. I also receive generous donations of herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, along with other people and businesses. This means I generally only need to purchase the ethanol (and other menstrua) to make the various preparations we distribute at the clinic. I work with three apprentices each year, who observe and make medicines with me at the clinic. One hope I have for herbal medicine is that more of these clinical mentorships happen for those wanting to work alongside a clinical herbalist in practice. I also feel fortunate to work alongside other health care disciplines. Herbal medicine, as with all medical modalities, has its limitations. It is helpful to be able to work in tandem with other health care workers. It is frustrating that this is not the norm in medicine. Imagine if multiple disciplines worked together for each patient. It would be an entirely new paradigm. Herbal medicine is a lives-long learning experience. Even after 30 years of solid study, I feel I have barely begun understanding the medicinal qualities of plants. And that is fine, as I have spent the time being around these beautiful and complex organisms. 18AT-RISK & ENDANGERED PLANTS: What Can We Do to Help? At Mountain Rose Herbs, we prefer to procure cultivated herbs instead of wildharvested ones when possible. We recognize the growing impact of overharvesting on wild stands of some of the world's most revered and beloved herbs and spices. Sometimes, of course, herb procurement isn't the primary problem\u2014many botanicals are being impacted by land use changes, in which wild colonies are destroyed by construction, logging, or flooding. That said, our years-long shift in policy is directly correlated to the way that unethical wildharvesters who sell native plants to herb consolidators and florists over-harvest in the name of profit. Additionally, we see issues when well-intentioned herbalists accidentally harvest badly or take too much, doing irreparable damage to plant families that had thrived in a spot for years. In all these ways, humans are using up many of the planet's botanicals faster than the earth can regenerate them. This is not to say that educated, aware herbalists should never wildharvest. Many botanicals are not at risk and some herbs cannot be cultivated; there are reasons to wildharvest certain plants, so long as you know what you're doing and you take the overall wellbeing of the plant family into consideration. Learning to identify and protect at-risk and endangered plants is key to their\u2014and our\u2014future. What is the Difference between Endangered Plants and At-Risk Plants? The United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 was the result of increasing public concern about the decline of many species due to human exploitation and/or habitat destruction. Prior acts of congress had protected some wildlife, but the ESA was the first federal legislation to include endangered plants. Under the ESA, plant species may be listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered signifies that a botanical is in danger of extinction throughout all or most of its range, while threatened indicates that a species is on its way to becoming endangered in the foreseeable future. Individual states also have ESA-type laws and designations, so a species may have different statuses at the federal and state levels, and they may vary from state to state. A species may be designated as threatened or endangered for a variety of reasons, including if its habitat or range is being destroyed, if it is impacted by disease or predation, or\u2014this is one that heavily impacts at-risk herbs\u2014if it is being over-utilized for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. Another good resource to put this into perspective is the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Founded in 1948, the IUCN offers the world's most comprehensive list regarding the conservation status of many thousands of species and subspecies. As of today, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species includes more than 40,000 species of plants and animals that are threatened with extinction, including 34% of the world's conifers and 63% of cycads. At-risk is not a legal term under the ESA or the IUCN, but is widely used in conservation circles. A species is considered at-risk when its numbers are in decline, when populations become low\u2014perhaps critically so\u2014but the plant or animal is still not legally protected. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, listing a species as federally protected by the ESA is the last resort. First, they try voluntary conservation actions that will hopefully improve habitats and protection for at-risk species.How Can We Help At-Risk Herbs? Many conservation and environmental protection organizations look at the big picture of threatened plants and animals. For instance, as a bulk organic herbs supplier, Mountain Rose Herbs follows CITES regulations that protect wild plants from over-exploitation through international trade. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was drafted in 1963 at an IUCN meeting and was agreed upon by representatives from 80 nations in 1973, the same year that the U.S. enacted the ESA. CITES regulations codify the reality that international cooperation is essential to safeguard species against over-exploitation. Today, over 38,700 species\u2014including 32,800 species of plants\u2014are protected by CITES against over-exploitation through international trade. Closer to home, one of our favorite groups focuses specifically on wild medicinal plants: United Plant Savers (UpS). Their purpose is to protect native medicinal plants of the U.S. and Canada, as well as crucial native habitats, and to ensure there is a renewable supply of these plants for future generations. For home and professional herbalists, they offer two important tools: their Species At-Risk List and their corresponding List of Herbs & Analogs. The UpS Species At-Risk List includes herbs that are \"currently in decline due to expanding popularity and shrinking habitat and range.\" This list is currently 40 botanicals long and includes herbs that are much beloved standbys for a wide swath of western herbalists: arnica, blue and black cohosh, echinacea, goldenseal, kava, slippery elm, and others. Sometimes it's easy to choose a cultivated species instead of an at-risk wild one, but when a cultivated option isn't available, UpS' List of Herbs & Analogs is a godsend. In this case, an analog is herbal-speak for an herb that will do more or less the same thing as another herb. Sometimes it requires several analogs in combination to replace that one at-risk botanical, and while it can be frustrating that there isn't a one-to-one swap for all at-risk herbs, the learning process is incredibly valuable both for expanding our skills as herbalists and preserving the future of these potent medicinal plants. In my opinion, demulcents are the unsung heroes of the herbal world. Demulcents contain mucilage and are known for their soothing and protective qualities\u2014especially for our mucus membranes. When used topically they are referred to as an emollient. These moistening herbs are fantastic for hydrating occasionally dry skin, providing relief to periodic dry coughs, soothing us when we're sun-kissed, aiding in digestion, and the list goes on. In my opinion, demulcents should be shown the same amount of love as adaptogens and nervines! Some beloved demulcents include slippery elm, flax, chia seed, plantain, violet, cinnamon, aloe vera, and even oatmeal. When choosing a demulcent, just like any herb, it is important to consider the sustainability of its use and harvest. Traditionally, slippery elm was a popular demulcent for its sweet taste and especially gooey consistency when mixed with water. However, today this botanical is facing stresses from habitat loss, disease, and overharvesting resulting in its listing on United Plant Savers' Species At-Risk list. Luckily, there are weedy and abundant alternatives to use, like my personal favorite, marshmallow! History & Make Up of Marshmallow Marshmallow's genus name Althaea is derived from the Greek 'altho' meaning 'to cure' and its family name Malvaceae is derived from the Greek 'malake' which can be translated to 'soft.' In her Mountain Rose Herbs blog, Marshmallow Root & Leaf: Where Fluffy Food Meets Soothing Remedy, herbalist, medical doctor, educator, and researcher, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, explains, \"botanicals that are demulcents like marshmallow have a calming effect on the mucus membranes they come into contact with because they contain mucopolysaccharides. These are chains of sugar molecules, which in humans are often found in mucus and in the fluid around our joints. So a demulcent essentially coats those irritated membranes and offers soothing relief.\" Marshmallow has centuries' worth of use in traditional herbal practices across Europe and Western Asia, its native habitats. A beautiful and joyful plant, marshmallow is easy to grow in the garden and a welcome staple in the home apothecary. Made famous in confectionaries and as a tasty campfire treat, marshmallow is an herb that is mainstream in its name yet remains on the fringe in terms of its wellness-promoting uses. The history of marshmallow can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians who made a sweet treat reserved for royalty by blending the root with honey. And, for thousands of years, people all over the world have used marshmallow root to soothe the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach. The root sap has long been a favorite when working with children experiencing dry, irritated throats and other similar issues. In order to make this soothing demulcent more palatable to children, confectioners in 19th century France invented a soft, sweetened, healthful marshmallow root lozenge that children enjoyed, called p\u00e2t\u00e9 de guimauve. This helps to explain how today's modern bright-white confection came into being. Unfortunately, its previously healthful uses have mostly been discarded in favor of making a sweet treat.Marshmallow in the Garden I may be biased, but Althaea officinalis is a stunning perennial. This gentle plant has thick, three to five lobed leaves which are velvety to the touch. Its light-pink, five-petaled flowers bloom in late summer and ripen into a flat, round fruit resembling a wheel of cheese and giving the plant one of its nicknames\u2014cheeses! As a former cheesemonger, I'm especially fond of this common name. Marshmallow loves to have its roots wet and thrives in damp soils. It is easy to cultivate in garden beds that stay relatively moist. Preferring partial shade to full sun, the plant reaches a height of 3-4 feet when mature. This perennial will grace your garden yearly as long as all of the roots aren't harvested. You can propagate marshmallow by dividing its roots in the fall or sowing from seed. Mountain Rose Herbs sells marshmallow seeds from Strictly Medicinal Seeds, which recommends sowing scarified seeds in spring. Scarifying is the process of using sand or sandpaper to weaken the coating of the seed to promote germination and may also include nicking the seeds and/or soaking in water. If this process is daunting, consult your local nursery to see if they sell starts. If you don't have the space or ability to grow your own, be sure to purchase organically grown marshmallow from a reputable company.Marshmallow Benefits & Recipes There are numerous ways to enjoy marshmallow. The tender, fresh spring greens can be eaten in salads or enjoyed as a saut\u00e9. Its delicate flowers make a beautiful garnish for salads and dips\u2014or simply eat as-is while walking through the garden. The entire plant (leaf, flower, seed, and root) can be dried for use in teas, extracts, and topical applications. Considered to be energetically cooling, the plant is often indicated for relief from heat and irritation. Neutral yet slightly sweet in flavor, marshmallow is easy to introduce as a tonic herb for its nutritive and moistening properties. In fact, inviting marshmallow into your daily internal herbal routine can positively impact your digestive tract and overall wellness because of its ability to thoroughly coat mucus membranes. Marshmallow can also be utilized yearlong in herbal syrups for winter wellness, herbal tea blends for springtime support, after-sun care during the summer months, and in lotions and lip balms for fall skin care. It's important to know, though, that the beneficial mucopolysaccharides in marshmallow are destroyed by heat. My favorite way to prepare marshmallow root is a cold infusion. Preparing a cold infusion retains the mucopolysaccharides found throughout the plant so you get the most out of it. Dr. Low Dog's marshmallow tea recipe is an excellent example: Marshmallow recipes from the Mountain Rose Herbs blog:MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 19At Mountain Rose Herbs, we prefer to procure cultivated herbs instead of wildharvested ones when possible.

Sometimes it requires several analogs in combination to replace that one at-risk botanical, and while it can be frustrating that there isn't a one-to-one swap for all at-risk herbs, the learning process is incredibly valuable both for expanding our skills as herbalists and preserving the future of these potent medicinal plants.

Demulcents contain mucilage and are known for their soothing and protective qualities\u2014especially for our mucus membranes. When used topically they are referred to as an emollient. These moistening herbs are fantastic for hydrating occasionally dry skin, providing relief to periodic dry coughs, soothing us when we're sun-kissed, aiding in digestion, and the list goes on. In my opinion, demulcents should be shown the same amount of love as adaptogens and nervines! Some beloved demulcents include slippery elm, flax, chia seed, plantain, violet, cinnamon, aloe vera, and even oatmeal. When choosing a demulcent, just like any herb, it is important to consider the sustainability of its use and harvest. Traditionally, slippery elm was a popular demulcent for its sweet taste and especially gooey consistency when mixed with water. However, today this botanical is facing stresses from habitat loss, disease, and overharvesting resulting in its listing on United Plant Savers' Species At-Risk list. Luckily, there are weedy and abundant alternatives to use, like my personal favorite, marshmallow! History & Make Up of Marshmallow Marshmallow's genus name Althaea is derived from the Greek 'altho' meaning 'to cure' and its family name Malvaceae is derived from the Greek 'malake' which can be translated to 'soft.' In her Mountain Rose Herbs blog, Marshmallow Root & Leaf: Where Fluffy Food Meets Soothing Remedy, herbalist, medical doctor, educator, and researcher, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, explains, \"botanicals that are demulcents like marshmallow have a calming effect on the mucus membranes they come into contact with because they contain mucopolysaccharides. These are chains of sugar molecules, which in humans are often found in mucus and in the fluid around our joints. So a demulcent essentially coats those irritated membranes and offers soothing relief.\" Marshmallow has centuries' worth of use in traditional herbal practices across Europe and Western Asia, its native habitats. A beautiful and joyful plant, marshmallow is easy to grow in the garden and a welcome staple in the home apothecary. Made famous in confectionaries and as a tasty campfire treat, marshmallow is an herb that is mainstream in its name yet remains on the fringe in terms of its wellness-promoting uses. The history of marshmallow can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians who made a sweet treat reserved for royalty by blending the root with honey. And, for thousands of years, people all over the world have used marshmallow root to soothe the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach. The root sap has long been a favorite when working with children experiencing dry, irritated throats and other similar issues. In order to make this soothing demulcent more palatable to children, confectioners in 19th century France invented a soft, sweetened, healthful marshmallow root lozenge that children enjoyed, called p\u00e2t\u00e9 de guimauve. This helps to explain how today's modern bright-white confection came into being. Unfortunately, its previously healthful uses have mostly been discarded in favor of making a sweet treat.Marshmallow in the Garden I may be biased, but Althaea officinalis is a stunning perennial. This gentle plant has thick, three to five lobed leaves which are velvety to the touch. Its light-pink, five-petaled flowers bloom in late summer and ripen into a flat, round fruit resembling a wheel of cheese and giving the plant one of its nicknames\u2014cheeses! As a former cheesemonger, I'm especially fond of this common name. Marshmallow loves to have its roots wet and thrives in damp soils. It is easy to cultivate in garden beds that stay relatively moist. Preferring partial shade to full sun, the plant reaches a height of 3-4 feet when mature. This perennial will grace your garden yearly as long as all of the roots aren't harvested. You can propagate marshmallow by dividing its roots in the fall or sowing from seed. Mountain Rose Herbs sells marshmallow seeds from Strictly Medicinal Seeds, which recommends sowing scarified seeds in spring. Scarifying is the process of using sand or sandpaper to weaken the coating of the seed to promote germination and may also include nicking the seeds and/or soaking in water. If this process is daunting, consult your local nursery to see if they sell starts. If you don't have the space or ability to grow your own, be sure to purchase organically grown marshmallow from a reputable company.Marshmallow Benefits & Recipes There are numerous ways to enjoy marshmallow. The tender, fresh spring greens can be eaten in salads or enjoyed as a saut\u00e9. Its delicate flowers make a beautiful garnish for salads and dips\u2014or simply eat as-is while walking through the garden. The entire plant (leaf, flower, seed, and root) can be dried for use in teas, extracts, and topical applications. Considered to be energetically cooling, the plant is often indicated for relief from heat and irritation. Neutral yet slightly sweet in flavor, marshmallow is easy to introduce as a tonic herb for its nutritive and moistening properties. In fact, inviting marshmallow into your daily internal herbal routine can positively impact your digestive tract and overall wellness because of its ability to thoroughly coat mucus membranes. Marshmallow can also be utilized yearlong in herbal syrups for winter wellness, herbal tea blends for springtime support, after-sun care during the summer months, and in lotions and lip balms for fall skin care. It's important to know, though, that the beneficial mucopolysaccharides in marshmallow are destroyed by heat. My favorite way to prepare marshmallow root is a cold infusion. Preparing a cold infusion retains the mucopolysaccharides found throughout the plant so you get the most out of it. Dr. Low Dog's marshmallow tea recipe is an excellent example: Marshmallow recipes from the Mountain Rose Herbs blog:PRACTICAL STEPS WE CAN ALL TAKE TO HELP AT-RISK HERBS:If there is a cultivated option, use it instead of a wild option.If you are going to wildharvest, make sure you know appropriate places to harvest the herb, how to safely identify the plant, how much of it to take, how to harvest it respectfully, how to leave plenty behind, and how to preserve what you have harvested. Native plants aren't always best\u2014consider a non-native plant instead of a more fragile, at-risk native herb.If you absolutely must use an at-risk herb and you cannot find a cultivated option or analog, try growing it yourself!

Because of pressures facing these plant populations and significant variability in abundance, wildharvesting should be very limited and carefully monitored. Any wildharvest of these plants should align with rules established by federal, state, and local governments.\"In Review\" Definition: The In Review list contains native plants that have significant known medicinal, edible, and/or ornamental uses that have been recommended through United Plant Savers (UpS) membership or the UpS Board. UpS will review and, if necessary, score these plants for consideration for the At-Risk and Critical listing. Always use caution and careful consideration when sourcing these plants for either personal or commercial use.It's important to stay educated on where and how our herbs were grown and harvested. There are many factors that can put a strain on wildharvested medicinal plants which has resulted in a wide variety of botanicals being listed on United Plant Savers' (UpS) Species At-Risk List. As herbalists, best practice is to choose cultivated herbs over wildharvested and if this is not an option, then consider ethically wildharvested plants or an herbal analog. The herbal analogs listed in this chart are abundant (or easily cultivated) botanicals that function in a similar manner and provide similar beneficial results to at-risk plants. A single analog may not always cover the full spectrum of wellness potential of a particular at-risk plant but when AT-RISK BOTANICAL ANALOG CHART ADAPTED FROM JANE BOTHWELL combined with other analogs, can have similarly effective results. Consult your local herbalist or qualified health care practitioner to determine which analog combinations may be best for you when committing to substitute ecologically sensitive plants in favor of their abundant counterparts.

The tender, fresh spring greens can be eaten in salads or enjoyed as a saut\u00e9. Its delicate flowers make a beautiful garnish for salads and dips\u2014or simply eat as-is while walking through the garden. The entire plant (leaf, flower, seed, and root) can be dried for use in teas, extracts, and topical applications. Considered to be energetically cooling, the plant is often indicated for relief from heat and irritation. Neutral yet slightly sweet in flavor, marshmallow is easy to introduce as a tonic herb for its nutritive and moistening properties. In fact, inviting marshmallow into your daily internal herbal routine can positively impact your digestive tract and overall wellness because of its ability to thoroughly coat mucus membranes. Marshmallow can also be utilized yearlong in herbal syrups for winter wellness, herbal tea blends for springtime support, after-sun care during the summer months, and in lotions and lip balms for fall skin care. It's important to know, though, that the beneficial mucopolysaccharides in marshmallow are destroyed by heat. My favorite way to prepare marshmallow root is a cold infusion. Preparing a cold infusion retains the mucopolysaccharides found throughout the plant so you get the most out of it.

Demulcents contain mucilage and are known for their soothing and protective qualities\u2014especially for our mucus membranes. When used topically they are referred to as an emollient. These moistening herbs are fantastic for hydrating occasionally dry skin, providing relief to periodic dry coughs, soothing us when we're sun-kissed, aiding in digestion, and the list goes on. In my opinion, demulcents should be shown the same amount of love as adaptogens and nervines! Some beloved demulcents include slippery elm, flax, chia seed, plantain, violet, cinnamon, aloe vera, and even oatmeal. When choosing a demulcent, just like any herb, it is important to consider the sustainability of its use and harvest. Traditionally, slippery elm was a popular demulcent for its sweet taste and especially gooey consistency when mixed with water. However, today this botanical is facing stresses from habitat loss, disease, and overharvesting resulting in its listing on United Plant Savers' Species At-Risk list. Luckily, there are weedy and abundant alternatives to use, like my personal favorite, marshmallow! History & Make Up of Marshmallow Marshmallow's genus name Althaea is derived from the Greek 'altho' meaning 'to cure' and its family name Malvaceae is derived from the Greek 'malake' which can be translated to 'soft.' In her Mountain Rose Herbs blog, Marshmallow Root & Leaf: Where Fluffy Food Meets Soothing Remedy, herbalist, medical doctor, educator, and researcher, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, explains, \"botanicals that are demulcents like marshmallow have a calming effect on the mucus membranes they come into contact with because they contain mucopolysaccharides. These are chains of sugar molecules, which in humans are often found in mucus and in the fluid around our joints. So a demulcent essentially coats those irritated membranes and offers soothing relief.\" Marshmallow has centuries' worth of use in traditional herbal practices across Europe and Western Asia, its native habitats. A beautiful and joyful plant, marshmallow is easy to grow in the garden and a welcome staple in the home apothecary. Made famous in confectionaries and as a tasty campfire treat, marshmallow is an herb that is mainstream in its name yet remains on the fringe in terms of its wellness-promoting uses. The history of marshmallow can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians who made a sweet treat reserved for royalty by blending the root with honey. And, for thousands of years, people all over the world have used marshmallow root to soothe the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach. The root sap has long been a favorite when working with children experiencing dry, irritated throats and other similar issues. In order to make this soothing demulcent more palatable to children, confectioners in 19th century France invented a soft, sweetened, healthful marshmallow root lozenge that children enjoyed, called p\u00e2t\u00e9 de guimauve. This helps to explain how today's modern bright-white confection came into being. Unfortunately, its previously healthful uses have mostly been discarded in favor of making a sweet treat.Marshmallow in the Garden I may be biased, but Althaea officinalis is a stunning perennial. This gentle plant has thick, three to five lobed leaves which are velvety to the touch. Its light-pink, five-petaled flowers bloom in late summer and ripen into a flat, round fruit resembling a wheel of cheese and giving the plant one of its nicknames\u2014cheeses! As a former cheesemonger, I'm especially fond of this common name. Marshmallow loves to have its roots wet and thrives in damp soils. It is easy to cultivate in garden beds that stay relatively moist. Preferring partial shade to full sun, the plant reaches a height of 3-4 feet when mature. This perennial will grace your garden yearly as long as all of the roots aren't harvested. You can propagate marshmallow by dividing its roots in the fall or sowing from seed. Mountain Rose Herbs sells marshmallow seeds from Strictly Medicinal Seeds, which recommends sowing scarified seeds in spring. Scarifying is the process of using sand or sandpaper to weaken the coating of the seed to promote germination and may also include nicking the seeds and/or soaking in water. If this process is daunting, consult your local nursery to see if they sell starts. If you don't have the space or ability to grow your own, be sure to purchase organically grown marshmallow from a reputable company.Marshmallow Benefits & Recipes There are numerous ways to enjoy marshmallow.

In her Mountain Rose Herbs blog, Marshmallow Root & Leaf: Where Fluffy Food Meets Soothing Remedy, herbalist, medical doctor, educator, and researcher, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, explains, \"botanicals that are demulcents like marshmallow have a calming effect on the mucus membranes they come into contact with because they contain mucopolysaccharides. These are chains of sugar molecules, which in humans are often found in mucus and in the fluid around our joints. So a demulcent essentially coats those irritated membranes and offers soothing relief.\" Marshmallow has centuries' worth of use in traditional herbal practices across Europe and Western Asia, its native habitats. A beautiful and joyful plant, marshmallow is easy to grow in the garden and a welcome staple in the home apothecary. Made famous in confectionaries and as a tasty campfire treat, marshmallow is an herb that is mainstream in its name yet remains on the fringe in terms of its wellness-promoting uses. The history of marshmallow can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians who made a sweet treat reserved for royalty by blending the root with honey. And, for thousands of years, people all over the world have used marshmallow root to soothe the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach. The root sap has long been a favorite when working with children experiencing dry, irritated throats and other similar issues. In order to make this soothing demulcent more palatable to children, confectioners in 19th century France invented a soft, sweetened, healthful marshmallow root lozenge that children enjoyed, called p\u00e2t\u00e9 de guimauve. This helps to explain how today's modern bright-white confection came into being. Unfortunately, its previously healthful uses have mostly been discarded in favor of making a sweet treat.Marshmallow in the Garden I may be biased, but Althaea officinalis is a stunning perennial. This gentle plant has thick, three to five lobed leaves which are velvety to the touch. Its light-pink, five-petaled flowers bloom in late summer and ripen into a flat, round fruit resembling a wheel of cheese and giving the plant one of its nicknames\u2014cheeses! As a former cheesemonger, I'm especially fond of this common name. Marshmallow loves to have its roots wet and thrives in damp soils. It is easy to cultivate in garden beds that stay relatively moist. Preferring partial shade to full sun, the plant reaches a height of 3-4 feet when mature. This perennial will grace your garden yearly as long as all of the roots aren't harvested. You can propagate marshmallow by dividing its roots in the fall or sowing from seed. Mountain Rose Herbs sells marshmallow seeds from Strictly Medicinal Seeds, which recommends sowing scarified seeds in spring. Scarifying is the process of using sand or sandpaper to weaken the coating of the seed to promote germination and may also include nicking the seeds and/or soaking in water. If this process is daunting, consult your local nursery to see if they sell starts. If you don't have the space or ability to grow your own, be sure to purchase organically grown marshmallow from a reputable company.Marshmallow Benefits & Recipes There are numerous ways to enjoy marshmallow. The tender, fresh spring greens can be eaten in salads or enjoyed as a saut\u00e9. Its delicate flowers make a beautiful garnish for salads and dips\u2014or simply eat as-is while walking through the garden. The entire plant (leaf, flower, seed, and root) can be dried for use in teas, extracts, and topical applications. Considered to be energetically cooling, the plant is often indicated for relief from heat and irritation. Neutral yet slightly sweet in flavor, marshmallow is easy to introduce as a tonic herb for its nutritive and moistening properties. In fact, inviting marshmallow into your daily internal herbal routine can positively impact your digestive tract and overall wellness because of its ability to thoroughly coat mucus membranes. Marshmallow can also be utilized yearlong in herbal syrups for winter wellness, herbal tea blends for springtime support, after-sun care during the summer months, and in lotions and lip balms for fall skin care. It's important to know, though, that the beneficial mucopolysaccharides in marshmallow are destroyed by heat. My favorite way to prepare marshmallow root is a cold infusion. Preparing a cold infusion retains the mucopolysaccharides found throughout the plant so you get the most out of it. Dr. Low Dog's marshmallow tea recipe is an excellent example: Marshmallow recipes from the Mountain Rose Herbs blog: When 1 part = 1 tablespoon, makes 1/2 cup tea blend (1 to 2 cups brewed tea). INGREDIENTS 3 parts organic marshmallow root 2 parts organic rose buds 2 parts organic Vana holy basil 1 part organic cassia cinnamon chips, or 1/2 part organic cassia cinnamon powder, or 1 organic cinnamon stick DIRECTIONS 1. Blend all herbs together in a bowl and store in a cool, dark, dry place. 2. When making the tea, bring water to a gentle simmer. 3. Scoop blend into tea strainer or kettle. Use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of tea blend for each brewed 8 oz. cup you plan to enjoy (depending on your tastes). 4. Pour water over tea blend, cover, and let steep for 10 minutes (covering will hold in all of the beneficial oils so they don't evaporate off). 5. Remove strained herbs and add sweetener if desired. 6. Drink slowly and mindfully and, most of all, enjoy!GOODNIGHT KISS TEA BLEND Makes about 8 oz. INGREDIENTS 2 cups room temperature, non-chlorinated water 2 Tbsp. organic marshmallow root 2 Tbsp. aloe vera gel 20 drops organic lavender essential oil 10 drops organic rosemary essential oil 1 Tbsp. organic argan oil, organic jojoba oil, or organic avocado oil (optional) DIRECTIONS 1. Place water and marshmallow root in small saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half. This should take at least 30 minutes. 2. Strain out the liquid and compost the spent marshmallow root. 3. Allow marshmallow tea mixture to cool. 4. Pour into an 8 oz. spray bottle, adding in aloe vera gel, lavender essential oil, rosemary essential oil, and carrier oil of choice. 5. Keep refrigerated and use up within 1-2 weeks.\"TAME THE MANE\" DETANGLER SPRAYMakes about 12 tubes. INGREDIENTS 2 Tbsp. organic hazelnut oil 1 Tbsp. organic unrefined coconut oil 1 Tbsp. organic cocoa butter (roughly 5 wafers) 1 Tbsp. beeswax pastilles 1 Tbsp. organic marshmallow root 6 organic cardamom pods 5 drops organic fresh ginger essential oil 1 drop organic nutmeg essential oil 1 drop organic cinnamon leaf essential oil A few drops of non-GMO vitamin E oil DIRECTIONS 1. Add both carrier oils, cocoa butter, and beeswax to a double boiler. Leave over medium heat until all ingredients are completely melted. 2. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and add marshmallow root and cardamom pods. Infuse for about 20 to 25 minutes. 3. Strain the oil using a fine mesh strainer or cotton tea net. 4. Add essential oils and vitamin E oil, and stir well. 5. Carefully pour the warm mixture into lip balm tubes. 6. Let completely cool before capping. PRO TIPS For more aromatic cardamom notes, be sure to break open the pods. If your lip balm is too soft, re-melt it and add more beeswax. If it is too hard, re-melt and add more oil. Be sure to pour the mixture into the tubes slowly and carefully. If you go too fast, you will cause air pockets to form in the lip balm. If your tubes develop air pockets, you can still fix it! Wave a hair dryer around the tube to melt the lip balm and fill the pocket. Be sure to keep your heat source moving so that you don't melt the tube!ULTRA-HYDRATING GINGER COOKIE LIP BALM 30In my opinion, demulcents are the unsung heroes of the herbal world. Demulcents contain mucilage and are known for their soothing and protective qualities\u2014especially for our mucus membranes. When used topically they are referred to as an emollient. These moistening herbs are fantastic for hydrating occasionally dry skin, providing relief to periodic dry coughs, soothing us when we're sun-kissed, aiding in digestion, and the list goes on. In my opinion, demulcents should be shown the same amount of love as adaptogens and nervines! Some beloved demulcents include slippery elm, flax, chia seed, plantain, violet, cinnamon, aloe vera, and even oatmeal. When choosing a demulcent, just like any herb, it is important to consider the sustainability of its use and harvest. Traditionally, slippery elm was a popular demulcent for its sweet taste and especially gooey consistency when mixed with water.

And the plants are calling us now, asking us for help. The wild gardens are in trouble, and the precious medicines of the earth are being lost.\" - Rosemary Gladstar, Planting the Future Sage Mountain Botanical Sanctuary was founded in 1987 by herbalist Rosemary Gladstar to protect 600 acres of wilderness and provide opportunities for education and healing. When Rosemary moved from her home in California to the other side of the continent, to an unfamiliar climate with plants yet to be introduced, she had the opportunity to wander the northern forests and hear the clarion call of the wild. Rosemary listened to that call, and devoted her life in service to the plants, turning her home into a Sanctuary to protect them, and to share with others in hopes of inspiring a growing awareness of earth stewardship. Thousands of students have visited the Sanctuary over the last three decades to learn from Rosemary, guest teachers, and the plants themselves.SAGE MOUNTAIN BOTANICAL SANCTUARY: In the Footsteps of Rosemary Gladstar EMILY RUFF WRITTEN BYLocated in unceded Abenaki Territory known as Central Vermont, Sage Mountain sits within an 80,000-acre contiguous roadless forest, designated by the state as the highest priority landscape. This designation is a nod to the diverse plant life, wildlife, riparian corridor, geology, hydrology, and ecosystems that make up the land. Take a walk through the fifteen miles of trails at Sage Mountain and you'll cross through hardwood forest, softwood forest, mountain springs and seeps, perennial streams, glacial erratics, and bald face alpine forest at the mountains' peaks. Take a dip in the pond and be serenaded by the melodies of a myriad of songbirds nesting in the treetops of the balsam fir, striped maple, yellow birch, and spruce. Signs of bobcat dens in the granite boulders, bear nests in the tops of trees, and moose prints in the muddy banks of the stream lend evidence to the incredible non-human community that calls Sage Mountain home. Conserving ecosystems for wildlife also extends conservation to the same habitats that are home to rare and unique plant species, many of which are familiar medicinal allies to the herbal community. The white flowers of bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) burst forth above the snow in early spring, followed by the opening of their tightly curled and deeply lobed leaves. The hypnotic flowers of blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) unfurl beside the trails alongside other spring ephemerals. The red, yellow, pink, and white triad of petals on trillium (Trillium spp.) flowers layer their geometry with sets of three leaves. Showy white stalks of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa) flowers emerge by midsummer to fill the air with their unique aroma. The mysterious ghost pipes (Monotropa uniflora) emerge from the leaf litter in autumn to elicit enchantment as we walk the trails. Bright red ginseng (Panax quinqefolium) and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) berries light up the forest floor and summer starts to wane. Of all the plants who inhabit Sage Mountain\u2014of which over 400 have been documented and cataloged\u2014perhaps the most breathtaking of all is Cyprepedium reginae, the showy pink ladyslipper. Making its home in Sage Mountain's rare calcareous fen\u2014a northern cedar swamp ladyslipper (Cyprepredium parviflorum), showy pink ladyslipper represents an imperiled medicinal plant that has found a safe space to flourish at Sage Mountain. Thousands of white and pink blooms begin to dot the wetland landscape just after Summer Solstice and fade away by early July. Hundreds of visitors pilgrimage to the Sanctuary each summer to experience these unique and rare blooms. The medicines of Sage Mountain teach us a myriad of lessons about human and habitat coexistence. For example, ginseng once flourished in the forests of Vermont, but logging and climate change have caused their populations to dwindle. Using our forests as an incubator for non-invasive ginseng propagation provides a model for other landowners to incorporate non-timber forest farming on their land, instead of just seeing their forests as trees, and thus, timber. Protecting established forests in Vermont doesn't just protect the plants that inhabit them, but also the birds, mammals, and amphibians that call them home. Many of the medicinal plants found at Sage Mountain are considered imperiled, either by a state or federal designation or by acknowledgment of the pressure that the modern herbal industry has placed on their wild populations. While some can be cultivated and re-established in the landscape, others\u2014like ladyslipper and ghost pipe\u2014are more difficult to propagate. Fortunately, organizations like United Plant Savers (UpS) have been working at the forefront of the medicinal plant conservation movement to address these issues and call for the widespread protection of these plants. Through the advocacy of groups like UpS, there is now more widely available education on the plight of these species, as well as botanical substitutions that may be utilized in their place to lessen the pressure on their wild populations. These plants remind us of the importance of knowing where our medicine comes from. In an age when herbal remedies are so easily accessible through the wonders of the internet, we have become deeply disconnected from the source of our healing. We consume plant remedies unaware of the impact our consumption has on their populations, much less the ecosystems they inhabit. By approaching our herbal practice with intention, and knowing the source of our medicines, we have the opportunity to protect these vital plants: for our own benefit, for future generations, and\u2014most importantly\u2014for the plants themselves. Rosemary passed the torch of stewardship for Sage Mountain Botanical Sanctuary in 2018 to a nonprofit organization dedicated to continuing her work through conservation, education, and healing. Her legacy lives on through online courses, private retreats, seasonal residencies, group programs, conservation work, hospice collaborations, wildlife and plant advocacy, and youth enrichment programs. We invite you to visit us to walk through the woods, meet the plants, listen to their call, and let it fill your spirit.In my opinion, demulcents are the unsung heroes of the herbal world.

If this process is daunting, consult your local nursery to see if they sell starts. If you don't have the space or ability to grow your own, be sure to purchase organically grown marshmallow from a reputable company.Marshmallow Benefits & Recipes There are numerous ways to enjoy marshmallow. The tender, fresh spring greens can be eaten in salads or enjoyed as a saut\u00e9. Its delicate flowers make a beautiful garnish for salads and dips\u2014or simply eat as-is while walking through the garden. The entire plant (leaf, flower, seed, and root) can be dried for use in teas, extracts, and topical applications. Considered to be energetically cooling, the plant is often indicated for relief from heat and irritation. Neutral yet slightly sweet in flavor, marshmallow is easy to introduce as a tonic herb for its nutritive and moistening properties. In fact, inviting marshmallow into your daily internal herbal routine can positively impact your digestive tract and overall wellness because of its ability to thoroughly coat mucus membranes. Marshmallow can also be utilized yearlong in herbal syrups for winter wellness, herbal tea blends for springtime support, after-sun care during the summer months, and in lotions and lip balms for fall skin care. It's important to know, though, that the beneficial mucopolysaccharides in marshmallow are destroyed by heat. My favorite way to prepare marshmallow root is a cold infusion. Preparing a cold infusion retains the mucopolysaccharides found throughout the plant so you get the most out of it. Dr. Low Dog's marshmallow tea recipe is an excellent example: Marshmallow recipes from the Mountain Rose Herbs blog: \"Ask anyone who has dug their hands deep in the dirt, planted seeds, harvested medicine, and taken time simply to get to know plants on their own turf, and they will tell you that plants communicate clearly if we but choose to listen. And the plants are calling us now, asking us for help. The wild gardens are in trouble, and the precious medicines of the earth are being lost.\" - Rosemary Gladstar, Planting the Future Sage Mountain Botanical Sanctuary was founded in 1987 by herbalist Rosemary Gladstar to protect 600 acres of wilderness and provide opportunities for education and healing. When Rosemary moved from her home in California to the other side of the continent, to an unfamiliar climate with plants yet to be introduced, she had the opportunity to wander the northern forests and hear the clarion call of the wild. Rosemary listened to that call, and devoted her life in service to the plants, turning her home into a Sanctuary to protect them, and to share with others in hopes of inspiring a growing awareness of earth stewardship. Thousands of students have visited the Sanctuary over the last three decades to learn from Rosemary, guest teachers, and the plants themselves. Located in unceded Abenaki Territory known as Central Vermont, Sage Mountain sits within an 80,000-acre contiguous roadless forest, designated by the state as the highest priority landscape. This designation is a nod to the diverse plant life, wildlife, riparian corridor, geology, hydrology, and ecosystems that make up the land. Take a walk through the fifteen miles of trails at Sage Mountain and you'll cross through hardwood forest, softwood forest, mountain springs and seeps, perennial streams, glacial erratics, and bald face alpine forest at the mountains' peaks. Take a dip in the pond and be serenaded by the melodies of a myriad of songbirds nesting in the treetops of the balsam fir, striped maple, yellow birch, and spruce. Signs of bobcat dens in the granite boulders, bear nests in the tops of trees, and moose prints in the muddy banks of the stream lend evidence to the incredible non-human community that calls Sage Mountain home. Conserving ecosystems for wildlife also extends conservation to the same habitats that are home to rare and unique plant species, many of which are familiar medicinal allies to the herbal community. The white flowers of bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) burst forth above the snow in early spring, followed by the opening of their tightly curled and deeply lobed leaves. The hypnotic flowers of blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) unfurl beside the trails alongside other spring ephemerals. The red, yellow, pink, and white triad of petals on trillium (Trillium spp.) flowers layer their geometry with sets of three leaves. Showy white stalks of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa) flowers emerge by midsummer to fill the air with their unique aroma. The mysterious ghost pipes (Monotropa uniflora) emerge from the leaf litter in autumn to elicit enchantment as we walk the trails. Bright red ginseng (Panax quinqefolium) and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) berries light up the forest floor and summer starts to wane. Of all the plants who inhabit Sage Mountain\u2014of which over 400 have been documented and cataloged\u2014perhaps the most breathtaking of all is Cyprepedium reginae, the showy pink ladyslipper. Making its home in Sage Mountain's rare calcareous fen\u2014a northern cedar swamp ladyslipper (Cyprepredium parviflorum), showy pink ladyslipper represents an imperiled medicinal plant that has found a safe space to flourish at Sage Mountain. Thousands of white and pink blooms begin to dot the wetland landscape just after Summer Solstice and fade away by early July. Hundreds of visitors pilgrimage to the Sanctuary each summer to experience these unique and rare blooms. The medicines of Sage Mountain teach us a myriad of lessons about human and habitat coexistence. For example, ginseng once flourished in the forests of Vermont, but logging and climate change have caused their populations to dwindle. Using our forests as an incubator for non-invasive ginseng propagation provides a model for other landowners to incorporate non-timber forest farming on their land, instead of just seeing their forests as trees, and thus, timber. Protecting established forests in Vermont doesn't just protect the plants that inhabit them, but also the birds, mammals, and amphibians that call them home. Many of the medicinal plants found at Sage Mountain are considered imperiled, either by a state or federal designation or by acknowledgment of the pressure that the modern herbal industry has placed on their wild populations. While some can be cultivated and re-established in the landscape, others\u2014like ladyslipper and ghost pipe\u2014are more difficult to propagate. Fortunately, organizations like United Plant Savers (UpS) have been working at the forefront of the medicinal plant conservation movement to address these issues and call for the widespread protection of these plants. Through the advocacy of groups like UpS, there is now more widely available education on the plight of these species, as well as botanical substitutions that may be utilized in their place to lessen the pressure on their wild populations. These plants remind us of the importance of knowing where our medicine comes from. In an age when herbal remedies are so easily accessible through the wonders of the internet, we have become deeply disconnected from the source of our healing. We consume plant remedies unaware of the impact our consumption has on their populations, much less the ecosystems they inhabit. By approaching our herbal practice with intention, and knowing the source of our medicines, we have the opportunity to protect these vital plants: for our own benefit, for future generations, and\u2014most importantly\u2014for the plants themselves. Rosemary passed the torch of stewardship for Sage Mountain Botanical Sanctuary in 2018 to a nonprofit organization dedicated to continuing her work through conservation, education, and healing. Her legacy lives on through online courses, private retreats, seasonal residencies, group programs, conservation work, hospice collaborations, wildlife and plant advocacy, and youth enrichment programs. We invite you to visit us to walk through the woods, meet the plants, listen to their call, and let it fill your spirit. 34In my opinion, demulcents are the unsung heroes of the herbal world. Demulcents contain mucilage and are known for their soothing and protective qualities\u2014especially for our mucus membranes. When used topically they are referred to as an emollient. These moistening herbs are fantastic for hydrating occasionally dry skin, providing relief to periodic dry coughs, soothing us when we're sun-kissed, aiding in digestion, and the list goes on. In my opinion, demulcents should be shown the same amount of love as adaptogens and nervines! Some beloved demulcents include slippery elm, flax, chia seed, plantain, violet, cinnamon, aloe vera, and even oatmeal. When choosing a demulcent, just like any herb, it is important to consider the sustainability of its use and harvest. Traditionally, slippery elm was a popular demulcent for its sweet taste and especially gooey consistency when mixed with water. However, today this botanical is facing stresses from habitat loss, disease, and overharvesting resulting in its listing on United Plant Savers' Species At-Risk list. Luckily, there are weedy and abundant alternatives to use, like my personal favorite, marshmallow! History & Make Up of Marshmallow Marshmallow's genus name Althaea is derived from the Greek 'altho' meaning 'to cure' and its family name Malvaceae is derived from the Greek 'malake' which can be translated to 'soft.' In her Mountain Rose Herbs blog, Marshmallow Root & Leaf: Where Fluffy Food Meets Soothing Remedy, herbalist, medical doctor, educator, and researcher, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, explains, \"botanicals that are demulcents like marshmallow have a calming effect on the mucus membranes they come into contact with because they contain mucopolysaccharides. These are chains of sugar molecules, which in humans are often found in mucus and in the fluid around our joints. So a demulcent essentially coats those irritated membranes and offers soothing relief.\" Marshmallow has centuries' worth of use in traditional herbal practices across Europe and Western Asia, its native habitats. A beautiful and joyful plant, marshmallow is easy to grow in the garden and a welcome staple in the home apothecary. Made famous in confectionaries and as a tasty campfire treat, marshmallow is an herb that is mainstream in its name yet remains on the fringe in terms of its wellness-promoting uses. The history of marshmallow can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians who made a sweet treat reserved for royalty by blending the root with honey. And, for thousands of years, people all over the world have used marshmallow root to soothe the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach. The root sap has long been a favorite when working with children experiencing dry, irritated throats and other similar issues. In order to make this soothing demulcent more palatable to children, confectioners in 19th century France invented a soft, sweetened, healthful marshmallow root lozenge that children enjoyed, called p\u00e2t\u00e9 de guimauve. This helps to explain how today's modern bright-white confection came into being. Unfortunately, its previously healthful uses have mostly been discarded in favor of making a sweet treat.Marshmallow in the Garden I may be biased, but Althaea officinalis is a stunning perennial. This gentle plant has thick, three to five lobed leaves which are velvety to the touch. Its light-pink, five-petaled flowers bloom in late summer and ripen into a flat, round fruit resembling a wheel of cheese and giving the plant one of its nicknames\u2014cheeses! As a former cheesemonger, I'm especially fond of this common name. Marshmallow loves to have its roots wet and thrives in damp soils. It is easy to cultivate in garden beds that stay relatively moist. Preferring partial shade to full sun, the plant reaches a height of 3-4 feet when mature. This perennial will grace your garden yearly as long as all of the roots aren't harvested. You can propagate marshmallow by dividing its roots in the fall or sowing from seed. Mountain Rose Herbs sells marshmallow seeds from Strictly Medicinal Seeds, which recommends sowing scarified seeds in spring.

Depending on intended action, substitutions may include yucca, considerations: Celandine offers a potential substitute for skin issues, and rosemary may be a cultivated species for use in its place for respiratory concerns. BLUE COHOSH Caulophyllum thalictroides Medicinal Conservation considerations: Motherwort is one herb that has been introduced in the place of blue cohosh. GINSENG Panax quinqefolium Medicinal Conservation considerations: Depending on the energetics of the person and condition, consider other adaptogens with similar actions that may be suitable (ashwagandha, astragalus, eleuthero, and schizandra, for example). While the roots are most commonly utilized, the leaves may offer similar benefits without harvesting the entire plant. GOLDENSEAL Hydrastis canadensis Medicinal parts: leaves, rhizome Actions: antimicrobial, bitter tonic, locally acting antibiotic, mild immune stimulant Conservation considerations: Many herbalists attribute goldenseal's actions to the presence of the alkaloid berberine. Other herbs rich in berberine include barberry, coptis, and Oregon grape root, which may offer similar benefits. While the roots are most commonly utilized, the leaves may offer similar benefits without harvesting the entire plant. ** Ghost pipe, ladyslipper, and trillium are considered endangered across many of their native regions and are less commonly cultivated and propagated. While many trillium species, in particular, may be found in abundance in a certain ecosystem, across the continent they are considered imperiled. These species have fallen out of common use in much of modern herbalism, due to barriers to access and their imperiled status. For this reason, I have opted not to provide a write-up on their medicinal actions to avoid encouraging their use or wildharvest. 36EXPLORE SAGE MOUNTAIN HERBS BY SCANNING HERE OR VISIT www.sagemountain.com Osha root (Ligusticum porteri) has been in use as an herbal medicine, incense, food, and for ceremonial purposes for thousands of years. When European colonists arrived in North America, osha was already being widely used by First Nations People in the American Southwest and Mexico to address a variety of conditions, particularly those involving the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The Zuni people chewed the root in healing rituals and the Tarahumara people used it ritualistically in protection ceremonies. This herbal ally has been generously gifting itself to humans on our continent for millennia, and its renown has spread to other parts of the world. Unfortunately, this increasing popularity has shined a light on osha's one significant problem\u2014virtually all commercial osha is wildharvested because this independent herb doesn't do well as a cultivated crop. This limitation combined with the ever-increasing demand for osha has many herbalists concerned about the viability and long-term sustainability of this precious botanical. Let's take a deeper dive into osha. BOTANY: WHAT IS OSHA? There are twelve ligusticum species, but only Ligusticum porteri is true osha. In the American West, it is considered a keystone plant species because it is a vital source of food and shelter for other species. Osha root\u2014also called Bear Medicine or Bear Root\u2014is a member of the Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) family, which includes carrots, dill, anise, fennel, angelica, hemlock, cow parsley, etc. Osha grows up to three feet tall and has bright green parsley- or carrot-like leaves. Osha is a perennial native in the high elevations (9,000 feet and above) of the Rocky Mountains and northwestern TAKE ACTION TO HELP OSHA PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU PURCHASE If you are purchasing osha, ask questions. Make sure you know where and how your osha was harvested, and purchase only sustainably harvested roots. The osha root extract and Osha Ultra Syrup that Mountain Rose Herbs sells use osha that has been sustainably collected in collaboration with the ongoing UpS osha research project mentioned in this article. Collected in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, the seasonal harvests are closely overseen by UpS using the findings from more than two decades of research. SUBSTITUTE PLANTS WITH SIMILAR ACTIONS There are a number of cultivated and sustainably harvested herbs that make good substitutes for osha in many formulations. Unless you are able to acquire sustainably harvested osha, consider using one or more of the following: For respiratory support, substitute elecampane root, lovage root, or angelica root. (Do not use angelica root if you are pregnant or nursing.)* For immune support, substitute acerola berry powder, elderberry, echinacea or ashwagandha root.* For demulcent support, substitute marshmallow root (slippery elm is a good substitute too, but is also struggling.)* For throat-soothing support, substitute wild cherry bark.*Mexico, where it is a favorite of both humans and bears. People have long noted that bears in the region seek out osha when they first emerge from hibernation, both eating the plant and chewing it into a mash which they rub into their fur, hence \"bear medicine.\" In turn, osha depends on the bears and other local wildlife to spread its seeds. Each of the little flowers that make up osha's umbels becomes a seed that can catch in the fur of a passing animal to be dropped to the soil further along the animal's journey. Wildharvesters dig up osha to get the dark, wrinkled roots. However, it is easy to confuse osha with poisonous hemlock, which has similar flat umbels of white flowers, so it is imperative to know the difference. Osha root is generally ingested as a tea, capsule, or extract for immune system support or to offer relief from the discomfort that comes with flu and cold season, digestive issues, and more. IS OSHA ENDANGERED? Although osha is not yet classified as endangered, United Plant Savers (UpS) has placed it on the At-Risk list. It is doing well in some areas of its range and is alarmingly over-harvested in others. In response to this troubling reality, Mountain Rose Herbs supports an important osha research project that is being overseen by UpS in collaboration with botanists at several state universities, state forestry services, and the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA). Over twenty-plus years, the project has funded a number of studies that look at the impact of commercial osha harvesting on the long-term sustainability of this herb. Although it is too early to draw final conclusions, initial results from these studies are heartening and seem to indicate that when harvested responsibly, with sustainability in mind, osha will regenerate and replenish itself. The studies also revealed important information that may help us support osha better. For instance, recent studies in the high elevations of southern Colorado, where conifers have been devastated by a bark beetle infestation, revealed that this tragic die-off of trees has in turn created a new opportunity for osha in that area and the plant has taken full advantage. To put this more succinctly, we know osha is a resilient botanical with a knack for surviving. It is the sheer volume of irresponsible harvesting that is at the core of this plant's current troubles. If we refuse to support harvesting practices that are geared toward profit instead of sustainability, we may be able to take enough pressure off this remarkable plant to allow it to regenerate across its native range.MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 37CULTIVATING GOLDENSEAL Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) is a plant that has a longstanding tradition in the world of herbalism. However, this beloved plant is suffering from consumer pressure and unregulated wildharvesting, resulting in its placement on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species List II and United Plant Savers 'Analog List for At-Risk and To-Watch Herbs. In order to ensure a sustainable future for goldenseal, Mountain Rose Herbs is helping to fund research to cultivate this hard-hit herbal ally. We recently visited Sleepy Hollow Herb Farm, a pioneer in cultivating goldenseal. We traveled into the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and up a long country road to find the herb farm situated picturesquely along the clear waters of Spring Creek. Certified organic in 2001, this third-generation working farm is owned and operated by Cindi and Randy. Their focus on goldenseal includes researching ways to domesticate this wild-collected plant without losing the attributes\u2014including chemical marker content and bioactivity\u2014that make it a valuable medicinal.

The osha root extract and Osha Ultra Syrup that Mountain Rose Herbs sells use osha that has been sustainably collected in collaboration with the ongoing UpS osha research project mentioned in this article. Collected in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, the seasonal harvests are closely overseen by UpS using the findings from more than two decades of research. SUBSTITUTE PLANTS WITH SIMILAR ACTIONS There are a number of cultivated and sustainably harvested herbs that make good substitutes for osha in many formulations. Unless you are able to acquire sustainably harvested osha, consider using one or more of the following: For respiratory support, substitute elecampane root, lovage root, or angelica root. (Do not use angelica root if you are pregnant or nursing.)* For immune support, substitute acerola berry powder, elderberry, echinacea or ashwagandha root.* For demulcent support, substitute marshmallow root (slippery elm is a good substitute too, but is also struggling.)* For throat-soothing support, substitute wild cherry bark.*Mexico, where it is a favorite of both humans and bears. People have long noted that bears in the region seek out osha when they first emerge from hibernation, both eating the plant and chewing it into a mash which they rub into their fur, hence \"bear medicine.\" In turn, osha depends on the bears and other local wildlife to spread its seeds. Each of the little flowers that make up osha's umbels becomes a seed that can catch in the fur of a passing animal to be dropped to the soil further along the animal's journey. Wildharvesters dig up osha to get the dark, wrinkled roots. However, it is easy to confuse osha with poisonous hemlock, which has similar flat umbels of white flowers, so it is imperative to know the difference. Osha root is generally ingested as a tea, capsule, or extract for immune system support or to offer relief from the discomfort that comes with flu and cold season, digestive issues, and more. IS OSHA ENDANGERED? Although osha is not yet classified as endangered, United Plant Savers (UpS) has placed it on the At-Risk list. It is doing well in some areas of its range and is alarmingly over-harvested in others. In response to this troubling reality, Mountain Rose Herbs supports an important osha research project that is being overseen by UpS in collaboration with botanists at several state universities, state forestry services, and the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA). Over twenty-plus years, the project has funded a number of studies that look at the impact of commercial osha harvesting on the long-term sustainability of this herb. Although it is too early to draw final conclusions, initial results from these studies are heartening and seem to indicate that when harvested responsibly, with sustainability in mind, osha will regenerate and replenish itself. The studies also revealed important information that may help us support osha better. For instance, recent studies in the high elevations of southern Colorado, where conifers have been devastated by a bark beetle infestation, revealed that this tragic die-off of trees has in turn created a new opportunity for osha in that area and the plant has taken full advantage. To put this more succinctly, we know osha is a resilient botanical with a knack for surviving. It is the sheer volume of irresponsible harvesting that is at the core of this plant's current troubles. If we refuse to support harvesting practices that are geared toward profit instead of sustainability, we may be able to take enough pressure off this remarkable plant to allow it to regenerate across its native range.Osha root (Ligusticum porteri) has been in use as an herbal medicine, incense, food, and for ceremonial purposes for thousands of years. When European colonists arrived in North America, osha was already being widely used by First Nations People in the American Southwest and Mexico to address a variety of conditions, particularly those involving the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

Their leadership in sustainable goldenseal development resulted in a USDA National Organic Program that certifies production, processing, and a standardization system for goldenseal. We are excited to say that 25 other small farmers in the U.S. Southeast have worked with Cindi and Randy to learn these successful methods and have joined them in establishing Botanipharm, LLC, the first 100% grower-owned botanical processing company in the United States. We encourage our herbal community seek out the most sustainable sources for the herbs you purchase. By partnering with dedicated farmers like Cindi and Randy, Mountain Rose Herbs is doing what we can to alleviate the pressures at-risk medicinal herbs like goldenseal are facing in the wild.

INGREDIENTS 1 cup baking soda 1/2 cup non-GMO citric acid 3 Tbsp. organic menthol crystals 20 drops organic eucalyptus essential oil 10 drops organic rosemary essential oil About 1/8 cup organic witch hazel Organic peppermint, spearmint, or eucalyptus leaf (optional garnish) DIRECTIONS 1.Add baking soda and citric acid to a bowl and mix, being sure to break up any clumps. Set aside. 2.Measure out menthol crystals into top of double boiler and heat until melted. Remove from heat. 3.Allow to cool slightly, then stir in essential oils. 4.Slowly pour melted mixture into dry ingredients while stirring. 5. Use a fork to thoroughly incorporate all ingredients and break up any clumps. 6. Fill an upcycled spray bottle with about 1/8 cup witch hazel and spray mixture while continuing to mix with the fork. 7. Add a little at a time and stop just when the mixture clumps up for you. 8. Once it holds together on its own, scoop out a big handful and make it into a ball-like shape. 9. Pack it well so that it will not crumble as it dries. 10. Sprinkle a little of the optional garnish on the top and gently push in so the herbs stick. 11. Place on parchment paper to dry for 24 hours. 12. Store in a cool, dry space. TO USE Heat up shower water. Once desired temperature is reached and you are ready to get into the shower, add shower bomb. We enjoy keeping it slightly outside of the water stream so that it lasts longer, but that is a personal preference. PRO TIPS These are not suitable for the bathtub. Using menthol crystals in this quantity in a bathtub is not recommended as it can cause skin irritation when mixed with hot water. We all have different sensitivities. If you feel that the oils in this are too strong, you can adjust them to your preference. Although you are making these into balls, the bottom will flatten out a bit, which will help it stay in place when you use it in the shower. Some people make their shower bombs in smaller sizes, but we don't find they last long enough. If you prefer to make small ones, you can certainly form them into smaller balls.

Over twenty-plus years, the project has funded a number of studies that look at the impact of commercial osha harvesting on the long-term sustainability of this herb. Although it is too early to draw final conclusions, initial results from these studies are heartening and seem to indicate that when harvested responsibly, with sustainability in mind, osha will regenerate and replenish itself. The studies also revealed important information that may help us support osha better. For instance, recent studies in the high elevations of southern Colorado, where conifers have been devastated by a bark beetle infestation, revealed that this tragic die-off of trees has in turn created a new opportunity for osha in that area and the plant has taken full advantage. To put this more succinctly, we know osha is a resilient botanical with a knack for surviving. It is the sheer volume of irresponsible harvesting that is at the core of this plant's current troubles. If we refuse to support harvesting practices that are geared toward profit instead of sustainability, we may be able to take enough pressure off this remarkable plant to allow it to regenerate across its native range.MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 43Osha root (Ligusticum porteri) has been in use as an herbal medicine, incense, food, and for ceremonial purposes for thousands of years. When European colonists arrived in North America, osha was already being widely used by First Nations People in the American Southwest and Mexico to address a variety of conditions, particularly those involving the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The Zuni people chewed the root in healing rituals and the Tarahumara people used it ritualistically in protection ceremonies.

Let's take a deeper dive into osha. BOTANY: WHAT IS OSHA? There are twelve ligusticum species, but only Ligusticum porteri is true osha. In the American West, it is considered a keystone plant species because it is a vital source of food and shelter for other species. Osha root\u2014also called Bear Medicine or Bear Root\u2014is a member of the Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) family, which includes carrots, dill, anise, fennel, angelica, hemlock, cow parsley, etc. Osha grows up to three feet tall and has bright green parsley- or carrot-like leaves. Osha is a perennial native in the high elevations (9,000 feet and above) of the Rocky Mountains and northwestern TAKE ACTION TO HELP OSHA PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU PURCHASE If you are purchasing osha, ask questions. Make sure you know where and how your osha was harvested, and purchase only sustainably harvested roots. The osha root extract and Osha Ultra Syrup that Mountain Rose Herbs sells use osha that has been sustainably collected in collaboration with the ongoing UpS osha research project mentioned in this article. Collected in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, the seasonal harvests are closely overseen by UpS using the findings from more than two decades of research. SUBSTITUTE PLANTS WITH SIMILAR ACTIONS There are a number of cultivated and sustainably harvested herbs that make good substitutes for osha in many formulations. Unless you are able to acquire sustainably harvested osha, consider using one or more of the following: For respiratory support, substitute elecampane root, lovage root, or angelica root. (Do not use angelica root if you are pregnant or nursing.)* For immune support, substitute acerola berry powder, elderberry, echinacea or ashwagandha root.* For demulcent support, substitute marshmallow root (slippery elm is a good substitute too, but is also struggling.)* For throat-soothing support, substitute wild cherry bark.*Mexico, where it is a favorite of both humans and bears. People have long noted that bears in the region seek out osha when they first emerge from hibernation, both eating the plant and chewing it into a mash which they rub into their fur, hence \"bear medicine.\" In turn, osha depends on the bears and other local wildlife to spread its seeds. Each of the little flowers that make up osha's umbels becomes a seed that can catch in the fur of a passing animal to be dropped to the soil further along the animal's journey. Wildharvesters dig up osha to get the dark, wrinkled roots. However, it is easy to confuse osha with poisonous hemlock, which has similar flat umbels of white flowers, so it is imperative to know the difference. Osha root is generally ingested as a tea, capsule, or extract for immune system support or to offer relief from the discomfort that comes with flu and cold season, digestive issues, and more.

INGREDIENTS 1/2 tsp. organic acacia (gum arabic) powder 1 tsp. organic sugar (Steven uses maple sugar) 1 1/2 tsp. organic elecampane root powder, organic lovage root powder, or organic angelica root powder (as a substitute for osha root powder) 1/2 tsp. organic licorice root powder, plus more for coating if desired Water or herbal extract (tincture) of choice (Steven and Howie like to use organic elecampane extract instead of water) DIRECTIONS 1. Combine and mix dry powders in a bowl. 2. Starting with one ounce of water or herbal extract, add one dropperful of liquid at a time to the bowl, and mix into the powders. 3. Keep adding liquid by dropperfuls until the mixture holds together in a clump, similar to the consistency of cookie dough. Be careful not to add too much liquid. 4. Form the dough into small (approximately 1/4-inch) pastilles/lozenges/stars/hearts etc. Keep the shapes small as the pastilles will be strong! Remember, these should not be seen as candy or a snack. 5. Dust with additional licorice root powder if desired. 6. Allow to dry on a screen or plate for a few days until totally dry. 7. Store in a glass jar with an air-tight lid in a cool, dark place for longest shelf life. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 49Osha root (Ligusticum porteri) has been in use as an herbal medicine, incense, food, and for ceremonial purposes for thousands of years. When European colonists arrived in North America, osha was already being widely used by First Nations People in the American Southwest and Mexico to address a variety of conditions, particularly those involving the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The Zuni people chewed the root in healing rituals and the Tarahumara people used it ritualistically in protection ceremonies. This herbal ally has been generously gifting itself to humans on our continent for millennia, and its renown has spread to other parts of the world. Unfortunately, this increasing popularity has shined a light on osha's one significant problem\u2014virtually all commercial osha is wildharvested because this independent herb doesn't do well as a cultivated crop. This limitation combined with the ever-increasing demand for osha has many herbalists concerned about the viability and long-term sustainability of this precious botanical. Let's take a deeper dive into osha. BOTANY: WHAT IS OSHA? There are twelve ligusticum species, but only Ligusticum porteri is true osha. In the American West, it is considered a keystone plant species because it is a vital source of food and shelter for other species. Osha root\u2014also called Bear Medicine or Bear Root\u2014is a member of the Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) family, which includes carrots, dill, anise, fennel, angelica, hemlock, cow parsley, etc. Osha grows up to three feet tall and has bright green parsley- or carrot-like leaves. Osha is a perennial native in the high elevations (9,000 feet and above) of the Rocky Mountains and northwestern TAKE ACTION TO HELP OSHA PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU PURCHASE If you are purchasing osha, ask questions. Make sure you know where and how your osha was harvested, and purchase only sustainably harvested roots. The osha root extract and Osha Ultra Syrup that Mountain Rose Herbs sells use osha that has been sustainably collected in collaboration with the ongoing UpS osha research project mentioned in this article. Collected in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, the seasonal harvests are closely overseen by UpS using the findings from more than two decades of research. SUBSTITUTE PLANTS WITH SIMILAR ACTIONS There are a number of cultivated and sustainably harvested herbs that make good substitutes for osha in many formulations. Unless you are able to acquire sustainably harvested osha, consider using one or more of the following: For respiratory support, substitute elecampane root, lovage root, or angelica root. (Do not use angelica root if you are pregnant or nursing.)* For immune support, substitute acerola berry powder, elderberry, echinacea or ashwagandha root.* For demulcent support, substitute marshmallow root (slippery elm is a good substitute too, but is also struggling.)* For throat-soothing support, substitute wild cherry bark.*Mexico, where it is a favorite of both humans and bears. People have long noted that bears in the region seek out osha when they first emerge from hibernation, both eating the plant and chewing it into a mash which they rub into their fur, hence \"bear medicine.\" In turn, osha depends on the bears and other local wildlife to spread its seeds. Each of the little flowers that make up osha's umbels becomes a seed that can catch in the fur of a passing animal to be dropped to the soil further along the animal's journey. Wildharvesters dig up osha to get the dark, wrinkled roots. However, it is easy to confuse osha with poisonous hemlock, which has similar flat umbels of white flowers, so it is imperative to know the difference. Osha root is generally ingested as a tea, capsule, or extract for immune system support or to offer relief from the discomfort that comes with flu and cold season, digestive issues, and more. IS OSHA ENDANGERED? Although osha is not yet classified as endangered, United Plant Savers (UpS) has placed it on the At-Risk list. It is doing well in some areas of its range and is alarmingly over-harvested in others. In response to this troubling reality, Mountain Rose Herbs supports an important osha research project that is being overseen by UpS in collaboration with botanists at several state universities, state forestry services, and the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA). Over twenty-plus years, the project has funded a number of studies that look at the impact of commercial osha harvesting on the long-term sustainability of this herb. Although it is too early to draw final conclusions, initial results from these studies are heartening and seem to indicate that when harvested responsibly, with sustainability in mind, osha will regenerate and replenish itself. The studies also revealed important information that may help us support osha better. For instance, recent studies in the high elevations of southern Colorado, where conifers have been devastated by a bark beetle infestation, revealed that this tragic die-off of trees has in turn created a new opportunity for osha in that area and the plant has taken full advantage. To put this more succinctly, we know osha is a resilient botanical with a knack for surviving. It is the sheer volume of irresponsible harvesting that is at the core of this plant's current troubles. If we refuse to support harvesting practices that are geared toward profit instead of sustainability, we may be able to take enough pressure off this remarkable plant to allow it to regenerate across its native range. \"They say this plant can make you barf,\" I made the mistake of telling a high school Agriculture class last spring as we paused to admire a group of American ipecac (Gillenia stipulata) plants on an oaky Southeast Ohio ridgetop.

Each of the little flowers that make up osha's umbels becomes a seed that can catch in the fur of a passing animal to be dropped to the soil further along the animal's journey. Wildharvesters dig up osha to get the dark, wrinkled roots. However, it is easy to confuse osha with poisonous hemlock, which has similar flat umbels of white flowers, so it is imperative to know the difference.

To put this more succinctly, we know osha is a resilient botanical with a knack for surviving. It is the sheer volume of irresponsible harvesting that is at the core of this plant's current troubles. If we refuse to support harvesting practices that are geared toward profit instead of sustainability, we may be able to take enough pressure off this remarkable plant to allow it to regenerate across its native range. \"They say this plant can make you barf,\" I made the mistake of telling a high school Agriculture class last spring as we paused to admire a group of American ipecac (Gillenia stipulata) plants on an oaky Southeast Ohio ridgetop. A few minutes later, the teacher and I learned that a couple of students had eaten a few leaves to test this allegation. I have told scores of people about this plant and its power to purge, and every single one of them crumpled up their faces in disgust and moved along the trail. Everyone except these two curious students, that is. The situation was far from an emergency and more of an opportunity, really, to watch their bold experiment unfold. In the end, the ipecac caused them to salivate heavily and feel slightly nauseous for about 20 minutes, but left their breakfasts where they lay. If I could show you the background photo of my laptop, you might not be surprised at the above incident. You would see a photo of a delicate drawing from a 5th grade student; the teacher had the class write thank-you notes to our team after a field trip to a beautiful headwater stream that flows into Sunday Creek. Sunday Creek is one of Athens County's main tributaries to the Hocking River, and is a microcosm of water quality issues throughout the region. Big chunks of Sunday Creek's watershed have been so heavily impacted by coal mining that its lower section is all but dead, polluted by Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). Parts of the watershed that have not been tainted by AMD, such as the field trip site, harbor an incredible diversity of aquatic creatures such as rainbow darters (a rainbow-colored fish that has no swim bladder but roams clear riffles), crawdads (the kids' favorite), macroinvertebrates (mayflies, stoneflies, dragonfly larvae, for example). Streams of all sizes in Southeast Ohio have carved into the raised Appalachian Plateau over the eons to create drier ridgetops, mesic benches, and riparian forests that provide habitat for well over 1,000 plant species. One of the most common understory shrubs is spicebush (Lindera benzoin). The student who created the drawing mentioned above had a chance to taste spicebush berries under our close tutelage. Without any warning of what it would taste like, he was surprised and somewhat appalled at the strange flavor. He claimed it was \"disgusting\" but there was an obvious revelry beneath his mask of surprise and distaste. The \"thank you\" drawing, though, is of him on all fours puking his guts out, and includes a caption with an arrow pointing to the barf. It simply reads, \"spicebush.\" This student taught me that, before giving people the opportunity to taste spiceberries for the first time, I need to warn them with something like, \"It tastes kind of weird but it ain't bad.\" This warning has made for a smoother introduction between students and a new wild taste like spicebush. Integrating local plants and mushrooms into lessons and field trips is integral to our environmental education team at Rural Action, a non-profit organization based in Southeast Ohio. We are lucky to have so many amazing plants and fungi to incorporate into our work with young people, and our education team is strengthened considerably by partnership with Rural Action's Sustainable Forestry team and United Plant Savers' Botanical Sanctuary in nearby Meigs County. Being so close to experts like Tanner Filyaw, one of the region's experts on ginseng, goldenseal, and other forest herbs has born fruit; in 2018 we collaborated on a curriculum called Appalachian Stewards. The curriculum, which features American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), has been our response to the television show Appalachian Outlaws, which idolizes already prevalent illegal ginseng poaching. Appalachian Stewards introduces students\u2014mainly 4th to 6th graders\u2014to ginseng, its life cycle, symbiosis with wood thrushes (seed dispersal) and hover flies (pollination), its cultural value and history. We even invented a simple game to show how easy it is to overharvest ginseng (or any other species of plant or wildlife with market value). By the last round, students have learned to harvest only a few plants so that the population persists in the long term. At the conclusion of the Appalachian Stewards unit, students get to plant ginseng seeds in tracts of forest on school property that are set aside for projects like this. Lo and behold, some of the ginseng we've planted has actually sprouted and grown. The 'Stewards lesson is interesting in that at least one student in every class already knows about ginseng because their parents or grandparents take them out looking for it every fall, or tell stories about doing so. Ginseng's lore and cultural importance have persisted over the years. When we come into these students' science classes and tell them we are here to teach about ginseng, their eyes light up and they are eager to share. One 5th grade student, for example, found his first ginseng plant when he was only four years old and he practically taught the rest of the class for us. This connection made science class come alive for him, and he reveled in the opportunity to flex his expertise for fellow classmates. He was even interviewed for the Smithsonian's Ginseng Stories* project, which we now incorporate into the curriculum. As we have learned more from Rural Action's Sustainable Forestry team and United Plant Savers' staff, we have expanded Appalachian Stewards to include inoculating logs with edible fungi. Just this spring, I watched with satisfaction as New Lexington Middle School students tapped shiitake pegs into sugar maple logs and covered them in wax. We stacked the logs in the shade right outside the 6th grade science room, and students will be able to observe the delicious decomposition over the next several years. We also made a straw Stropharia bed at the school to complement their many current outdoor projects, such as raised bed gardens, that the students work on with their awesome teacher, Jake Reyher. Last fall, I traveled to Washington County and made fire cider with another high school agriculture class, introducing them to some properties of ginger and garlic, and the wonders of apple cider vinegar. Lastly, making \"wild tea\" with our day camps has become a staple activity. Kids' minds are blown by what you can make tea out of\u2014pine needles, stinging nettles, beebalm--though we've found that having honey on hand is critical for kids' first foray into wild tea. If we are to look honestly at the outcome of these programs, I must admit that most of the students will not remember the name \"ginseng.\" They will recall that we \"learned about that one plant, gin something?\" The odds are better for the plants we use for tea, especially pine needles, since most kids know what a pine tree is already. Introducing them to many of the other plants, however, such as ginseng and goldenseal, or even having them smell wild blue phlox or inspect trillium flowers for insects, is a critical step in breaking down the \"green wall\" phenomenon. Green wall vision is seeing a green landscape full of indiscriminate plants with no contextual information. The experiences we give to students help transform their vision so they begin to see different plants throughout our fields and forests, and that it is possible to know them. Heck, they learn it is even possible to make a career out of studying plants. These types of seeds will bear fruit, albeit years down the road. Without environmental education programs that connect students to local land, the children are at risk, metaphorically, of dying of thirst amidst a sea of fresh water. Appalachian Ohio forests are rich with plants that can be eaten or used medicinally; in fact, our forests are rich with plants that people elsewhere pay healthy sums for like ginseng, goldenseal, black cohosh, and slippery elm. In a region rich in land and forests but struggling financially, introducing kids to forests is a matter of health and quality of life. Light bulbs go off in their minds, for example, as we show them potential profits from wild-simulated ginseng patches that have been well tended over 7-10 years. It is a joy to imagine some of these young students as future forest farmers earning income while preserving an endangered plant species, and a strong reminder that the fate of human beings is inextricable from that of the forests to which we belong. 52Osha root (Ligusticum porteri) has been in use as an herbal medicine, incense, food, and for ceremonial purposes for thousands of years.

Sitting beside a fire is one of my favorite pastimes. The full sensory experience offers so many aspects of comfort: the sensation of being warm and cozy, the abstract dance of the flames, the crackling sound of the wood changing form, and of course the aroma! One enjoyable element that I began incorporating into my summer campfires was the burning of herbs and spices to enliven the smell of the fire. When camping season was over, I yearned to bring this practice into my home fireplace. But I needed to find a way that was safer than my crude method of sprinkling herbs in the fire by hand. Then I had an ah-ha moment! These little fire starter bundles are really fun to make, they offer a productive way to use up older herbs and spices in your pantry, and they make wonderful gifts for the people in your life who enjoy an indoor or outdoor fire. I hope this recipe lights many fires that bring you warmth, peace, and comfort.How to Make Homemade FIRE STARTERS with Herbs WRITTEN BY JESSICKA NEBESNI PRO TIPS Pouring three fire starters at a time makes it easy to check on them as they begin to dry. Sometimes the wicks need rebalancing. If your mixture dries before you can add your \"toppings\", you can pop the cupcake pan in the oven on the lowest setting to melt the wax. How to clean up a beeswax mess is always a common question! The best way is to melt the wax on your utensils or cupcake pan and then wipe it away with a disposable rag or paper towel. Then you can wash it with soap and hot water.INGREDIENTS Possible aromatic herbs, spices, and resins: Organic bay leaf Organic cinnamon sticks Organic orange peel Organic whole cloves (or powder) Organic star anise Organic rosemary leaf Organic cedar leaf (or dry wildharvested evergreen leaves) Organic eucalyptus leaf Organic lavender flowers Organic frankincense resin (or powder) Copal resin Other supplies and ingredients: Cupcake or mini muffin papers Beeswax (2 cups of beeswax pastilles or about 8 oz. of grated beeswax will make about 12 fire starters) Candlewick or string\u201412 pieces cut to about 4 inches Parchment paperNATURAL FIRE STARTERS DIRECTIONS 1. Begin heating beeswax in a double boiler. 2. Place cupcake or mini muffin papers in a designated pan. 3. Fill cupcake liners 1/4 to 1/2 full with herb mixture of choice. (You'll want to reserve your more beautiful herbs for the topping, so I like to use evergreens, herbal powders, resins, and orange peel in the bottom of the liners). 4. Once beeswax is melted, dip wicks to lightly coat with wax and set aside on parchment paper. 5. Begin pouring remaining melted wax over the herbs in the cupcake liners until it just covers the material (about 2-3 tablespoons each). 6. Using a cinnamon stick or chopstick, push a wick down to the bottom of each cupcake paper OR create a U-shape with the wick and stuff both ends all the way down. You can then snip after drying to create a double-wick for faster burning. 7. Add more decorative ingredients on the top and allow to fully cool. 8. Snip wicks to about 1 inch.RECIPE BY JESSICKA NEBESNI Essential oils are one of the many gifts from nature. Plant material that is expertly distilled and bottled results in a potent scent that can be used in aromatherapy, body care recipes, and for pure enjoyment. But some of these precious essential oils are just that: precious. They can fetch a high price tag for various reasons including the oil content of the botanical or even the extraction method. Pure, quality essential oils, like the ones we sell at Mountain Rose Herbs, may be slightly more costly but the result is a deeper, richer aroma, and a profound aromatherapeutic benefit. ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP CONSIDERATIONS While there are no exact replacements for a particular fragrance, it is possible to achieve a relatively close scent profile. These recommended scent substitutions are based purely on aroma alone and are my personal suggestions.

I'll share with you the story of our land, which continues to evolve with time and stewardship, as we\u2014my family, community, and I\u2014continue to give back in all the ways we know how. I'll paint a picture first of what it looks like because the name came much later. In total, our farm is made up of one hundred acres, of which only thirty acres are actually \"farmed.\" At the back of our property, we have taken over sixty acres of workable land and given it back to nature, where trees, shrubs, wildflowers, and herbs are all now thriving. Since increasing the natural habitat for the surrounding wildlife, we are now gifted with sightings of deer, bears, rabbits, coyotes, turkeys, hawks, raccoons, and even rare sightings of bald eagles, lynx, and a cougar.

One day, when I was leading an herb walk discussing the at-risk plants, I happened to ask my sidekick and photographer extraordinaire, Serena, what had been her favorite plant. She responded, \"the yellow one,\" going back We have been able to bear witness to the beautiful process of rewilding on the acreage we have given back to nature at the back of our property. It consists of four natural areas, or ecosystems we could say: a small forest, containing lots of old birch and spruce; a large pond frequented by migrating birds in both spring and fall, and home to many more during the summer months; a riparian area nestled beside the pond that is home to many moisture-loving plants such as nigra) (the only place on this land's entirety that you'll find them, making it a very special place for both those that visit and those that inhabit it); and finally a glorious meadow, filled with native wildflowers, such as remaining 10 acres of our acreage where we live, you'll find our rustic farmhouse, barn, and outbuildings (where we host our herbal gatherings and classes), as well as two large hay fields and the pasture for our pony, Pepper, and her rescued mini companion, PC. Let me tell you about the strip of land that sits next to our farmhouse. When we first moved to the farm there was a big barren five-acre field, plowed and devoid of life, or so I thought. I often daydreamed of the neighboring bush finding its way to this barren space. With enough time, it did. Slowly came the box elders, dogwood, cedar, and so many other trees and plants, coming all on their own. This is when we began planting as many other native trees as we could. In these early days, we hadn't yet planted endangered species, because I didn't understand what it meant for plants to be endangered, at least, not in the way I do now. But, having already planted many different species and many native plants, it became this beautiful place for so many to enjoy: myself, my family and dogs, and all of the wildlife that came too. As time went on, I continued working passionately with herbs, and it wasn't long before my herb gardens by the house started to overflow. So I began to add herbs into the wild mix of what had already willingly some of my earliest plantings. All kinds of things were out there and so many trees continued to come on their own, creating this space so full of life. An anthill, for example, welcomed itself, growing an amazing two feet high, adding to the increasingly diverse ecosystem. It was hard not to feel a sense of joy being out there, knowing how many others wanted to share this space with my family and me. I suppose in giving the space back to nature, it took care of the rest. Years later, I attended the International Women's Symposium in the States. I had been wandering around the vendors and came across a United Plant Savers (UpS) booth, quickly realizing I had been contributing to similar initiatives for many years, though I still did not have a name for this land we had been giving back. It wasn't something I could articulate and it didn't have an end goal. It was just this process of planting and rewinding. I returned home with a goal of planting 2,000 trees and I joined UpS right away. I began to look at their work and understood better what it means to be an endangered plant. This led me to a website about species at risk in my home province, Ontario, and the extensive list of local endangered species that I have largely focused on ever since. This process has continued to be an exciting one for me, thinking I could make a difference in this way and impact the world around us. Though this is my heart's purpose, this work is so much farther reaching than just this land alone, especially when I get to share it with others. They inspire me to do more, and so the ripple continues, inspiring and being inspired, and there is so much you can do that makes a difference. Though we are lucky enough to live on this farm that we call home, you don't have to live on a farm or have a large amount of property to have a positive impact. Whatever you can do makes a difference. If you have a small yard, maybe you'll consider only mowing two-thirds, instead of the whole thing. Leave that third behind to take shape all on its own. Perhaps it will become a neat little ecosystem. Then you can inspire others to do the same, thus doubling your impact. If you have more land, you can plant at-risk or endangered medicinal plants in your own backyard, or someone else's if they are agreeable. You can even scatter endangered or at-risk seeds while walking your favorite trail. You can also donate to UpS, become a member, or donate to any other botanical organization that you feel strongly about. You can seek out UpS sanctuaries in your area and donate trees and plants or make a monetary donation. Lastly, be mindful of the species at risk, avoid foraging for those as much as possible, and refrain from purchasing those that are wildcrafted. Even the smallest steps have big impacts. So back to the sanctuary! For so long, I never had a name to express it. I finally asked a dear friend, an ingenious medicine woman named Lauri, if she could help me give my workings a name. Roughly a month later, the name came to her through spirit, and we had a naming ceremony. We sat outside by a bonfire with our three dogs in tow. Lauri came, she drummed and sang, holding space for a naming ceremony. The name that came to her, was Kina Gegoo, which means \"all things\" in Ojibway. When Lauri explained it to me, she said that she felt that the sanctuary was a place for all things\u2014the wild animals, the rocks, the plants, and all forms of nature were welcome here. That was a perfect name I thought, as it has always been a place where all are welcomed.It was hard to imagine when we first started planting that our efforts would turn into a botanical sanctuary! We are thrilled to say that we have planted over 3,000 native trees. Since 2015, we have been a Botanical Sanctuary Member of UpS. In 2021 we were honored to be recipients of the United Plant Savers Medicinal Plant Conservation award. Our mission will always be to protect native medicinal plants and their native habitat while ensuring an abundant renewable supply of medicinal plants for generations to come. Our future goals are simple: to increase the number of at-risk plant colonies annually. I dream that years from now someone will carry on my work with the plants, nurturing and loving our botanical sanctuary as much as I do. Until then, I will continue to pour my heart's love into this land, giving in the only way I know how to. Above all, I am incredibly thankful every day for my work within the herbal community, introducing people to the many uses of herbs and seeing them incorporate them into their own lives, for themselves and their loved ones. My task is to spread the word to give back. As I always say, giving back is good for the soul. Essential oils are one of the many gifts from nature.

In total, our farm is made up of one hundred acres, of which only thirty acres are actually \"farmed.\" At the back of our property, we have taken over sixty acres of workable land and given it back to nature, where trees, shrubs, wildflowers, and herbs are all now thriving. Since increasing the natural habitat for the surrounding wildlife, we are now gifted with sightings of deer, bears, rabbits, coyotes, turkeys, hawks, raccoons, and even rare sightings of bald eagles, lynx, and a cougar. In the last several years we have been focusing on planting at-risk medicinal plants. Some of the plants we have reintroduced into the wild are echinacea our most honored at-risk plant in the sanctuary came all on her own. One day, when I was leading an herb walk discussing the at-risk plants, I happened to ask my sidekick and photographer extraordinaire, Serena, what had been her favorite plant. She responded, \"the yellow one,\" going back to the photo she had taken, showing me a glorious picture of a Lady's Slipper Orchid (Cypripedium acaule Ait.). I was stunned! Since we had never planted this orchid, I guess the saying \"build it and they will come\" is true after all. We have been able to bear witness to the beautiful process of rewilding on the acreage we have given back to nature at the back of our property. It consists of four natural areas, or ecosystems we could say: a small forest, containing lots of old birch and spruce; a large pond frequented by migrating birds in both spring and fall, and home to many more during the summer months; a riparian area nestled beside the pond that is home to many moisture-loving plants such as nigra) (the only place on this land's entirety that you'll find them, making it a very special place for both those that visit and those that inhabit it); and finally a glorious meadow, filled with native wildflowers, such as remaining 10 acres of our acreage where we live, you'll find our rustic farmhouse, barn, and outbuildings (where we host our herbal gatherings and classes), as well as two large hay fields and the pasture for our pony, Pepper, and her rescued mini companion, PC. Let me tell you about the strip of land that sits next to our farmhouse. When we first moved to the farm there was a big barren five-acre field, plowed and devoid of life, or so I thought. I often daydreamed of the neighboring bush finding its way to this barren space. With enough time, it did. Slowly came the box elders, dogwood, cedar, and so many other trees and plants, coming all on their own. This is when we began planting as many other native trees as we could. In these early days, we hadn't yet planted endangered species, because I didn't understand what it meant for plants to be endangered, at least, not in the way I do now. But, having already planted many different species and many native plants, it became this beautiful place for so many to enjoy: myself, my family and dogs, and all of the wildlife that came too. As time went on, I continued working passionately with herbs, and it wasn't long before my herb gardens by the house started to overflow. So I began to add herbs into the wild mix of what had already willingly some of my earliest plantings. All kinds of things were out there and so many trees continued to come on their own, creating this space so full of life. An anthill, for example, welcomed itself, growing an amazing two feet high, adding to the increasingly diverse ecosystem. It was hard not to feel a sense of joy being out there, knowing how many others wanted to share this space with my family and me. I suppose in giving the space back to nature, it took care of the rest. Years later, I attended the International Women's Symposium in the States. I had been wandering around the vendors and came across a United Plant Savers (UpS) booth, quickly realizing I had been contributing to similar initiatives for many years, though I still did not have a name for this land we had been giving back. It wasn't something I could articulate and it didn't have an end goal. It was just this process of planting and rewinding. I returned home with a goal of planting 2,000 trees and I joined UpS right away. I began to look at their work and understood better what it means to be an endangered plant. This led me to a website about species at risk in my home province, Ontario, and the extensive list of local endangered species that I have largely focused on ever since. This process has continued to be an exciting one for me, thinking I could make a difference in this way and impact the world around us. Though this is my heart's purpose, this work is so much farther reaching than just this land alone, especially when I get to share it with others. They inspire me to do more, and so the ripple continues, inspiring and being inspired, and there is so much you can do that makes a difference. Though we are lucky enough to live on this farm that we call home, you don't have to live on a farm or have a large amount of property to have a positive impact. Whatever you can do makes a difference. If you have a small yard, maybe you'll consider only mowing two-thirds, instead of the whole thing. Leave that third behind to take shape all on its own. Perhaps it will become a neat little ecosystem. Then you can inspire others to do the same, thus doubling your impact. If you have more land, you can plant at-risk or endangered medicinal plants in your own backyard, or someone else's if they are agreeable. You can even scatter endangered or at-risk seeds while walking your favorite trail. You can also donate to UpS, become a member, or donate to any other botanical organization that you feel strongly about. You can seek out UpS sanctuaries in your area and donate trees and plants or make a monetary donation. Lastly, be mindful of the species at risk, avoid foraging for those as much as possible, and refrain from purchasing those that are wildcrafted. Even the smallest steps have big impacts. So back to the sanctuary! For so long, I never had a name to express it. I finally asked a dear friend, an ingenious medicine woman named Lauri, if she could help me give my workings a name. Roughly a month later, the name came to her through spirit, and we had a naming ceremony. We sat outside by a bonfire with our three dogs in tow. Lauri came, she drummed and sang, holding space for a naming ceremony. The name that came to her, was Kina Gegoo, which means \"all things\" in Ojibway. When Lauri explained it to me, she said that she felt that the sanctuary was a place for all things\u2014the wild animals, the rocks, the plants, and all forms of nature were welcome here. That was a perfect name I thought, as it has always been a place where all are welcomed. It was hard to imagine when we first started planting that our efforts would turn into a botanical sanctuary! We are thrilled to say that we have planted over 3,000 native trees. Since 2015, we have been a Botanical Sanctuary Member of UpS. In 2021 we were honored to be recipients of the United Plant Savers Medicinal Plant Conservation award. Our mission will always be to protect native medicinal plants and their native habitat while ensuring an abundant renewable supply of medicinal plants for generations to come. Our future goals are simple: to increase the number of at-risk plant colonies annually. I dream that years from now someone will carry on my work with the plants, nurturing and loving our botanical sanctuary as much as I do. Until then, I will continue to pour my heart's love into this land, giving in the only way I know how to. Above all, I am incredibly thankful every day for my work within the herbal community, introducing people to the many uses of herbs and seeing them incorporate them into their own lives, for themselves and their loved ones. My task is to spread the word to give back. As I always say, giving back is good for the soul. Essential oils are one of the many gifts from nature. Plant material that is expertly distilled and bottled results in a potent scent that can be used in aromatherapy, body care recipes, and for pure enjoyment. But some of these precious essential oils are just that: precious. They can fetch a high price tag for various reasons including the oil content of the botanical or even the extraction method. Pure, quality essential oils, like the ones we sell at Mountain Rose Herbs, may be slightly more costly but the result is a deeper, richer aroma, and a profound aromatherapeutic benefit. ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP CONSIDERATIONS While there are no exact replacements for a particular fragrance, it is possible to achieve a relatively close scent profile. These recommended scent substitutions are based purely on aroma alone and are my personal suggestions. This list is a good place to start, but you could do some additional experimentation on your own. Not only is it fun, but it's a great way to find what works with your personal perfume preferences. When applicable, I've also listed constituent and action replacements. Sometimes a particular essential oil is used for its chemical make up or to achieve a specified action. This is helpful if you're seeking essential oils that can be substituted for their desired therapeutic effects. While these replacements mimic the aroma of a treasured oil, sometimes a scent substitute just doesn't cut it. Four of the five oils on our list are available as a roll-on essential oil, providing these amazing scents in an attainable and easy-to-use way. THE ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP LISTWithout further ado, here is the list I've complied of essential oil alternatives for five of the most high-priced oils we offer: vanilla absolute, jasmine absolute, helichrysum essential oil, lemon balm essential oil, and Bulgarian rose essential oil. 60Though we have been tending to our lovely little Canadian farm for over thirty-four years, my relationship with the land began much earlier: in my childhood, spending time with my grandmother and my dad, who themselves shared a similar love of engaging with the magic and medicine of the natural world. I'll share with you the story of our land, which continues to evolve with time and stewardship, as we\u2014my family, community, and I\u2014continue to give back in all the ways we know how.

Four of the five oils on our list are available as a roll-on essential oil, providing these amazing scents in an attainable and easy-to-use way. Vanilla absolute is extracted from the pods of Vanilla planifolia, a tropical plant that is increasingly feeling the pressures of climate change and habitat loss. This base note oil is well known for its characteristic warming, rich, and sweet scent. Recommended Scent Replacements: Benzoin resin oil is a thick and viscous base note oil. Benzoin has resinous and sweet notes reminiscent of spice and vanilla. Peru balsam essential oil is used for its warming, sweetly balsamic-like scent. Also considered a base note, this thick oil has vanilla-like aromatic undertones.1 Heady and sweet, jasmine absolute is often used for its alluring floral aroma. A strikingly unique middle note fragrance, jasmine has no direct scent replacements and is difficult to replicate. However, playing with a combination of essential oils can get you close. I recommend adding either ylang ylang, vetiver, or patchouli essential oil to geranium as a close substitution. Recommended Scent Replacements: Geranium essential oil is bright with sweet, slightly herbaceous, and enticing floral aromatics. It is often used as a middle note. Ylang ylang essential oil has a rich and intoxicating floral scent. Its tropical, fruity fragrance adds depth when blended with geranium. Vetiver essential oil is a robust, long-lasting, and earthy scent. Its sweet yet woody characteristics pair well with geranium's floral notes. Patchouli essential oil is rich, warming, and earthy, pairing well with floral scents. Start with blending a drop or two to add depth to geranium when mimicking jasmine.

VANILLA ABSOLUTE SUBSTITUTES JASMINE ABSOLUTE SUBSTITUTES With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm. A cup of herbal tea with a bit of honey can be just the thing to heat the body and soul right up. I love making warming herbal teas this time of year as the beneficial herbs and spices are wonderful for stimulating circulation, warding off seasonal sniffles, and supporting digestion. On a chilly day, a cup can make you feel bundled and help support your immune system at the same time. One of the best parts of making herbal teas and honeys is that they are easy and quick to whip up. Most of the recipes only have a few ingredients and will just take a few minutes of your time. You can make one mug or brew a pot to enjoy throughout the day. HERBAL TEA RECIPES Here are some of my favorite go-to herbal tea recipes to stay snuggled up and healthy during the colder days.HERBAL HONEY RECIPES* Honey is an ingredient that many people have in the cupboard. You want to use raw honey when working with herbs because heating honey through the pasteurization process removes some of the beneficial health effects that support our bodies. Adding herbs to honey is very simple and will take the honey's therapeutic value to the next level. I love to have a few herbal honeys in the pantry and on the kitchen table as they are very shelf-stable and can be conveniently added to a range of breakfast items. In a jar, herbal honey can easily last for a year, although you may need to stir up the herbs every once in a while. Herbal honey can be added to flavor any tea or can make a great tea on its own. Herbal honeys also make great gifts as we head into the holiday season! Enjoy these herbal honey recipes by the spoonful or in your favorite herbal tea! The darker days inspire more respite and more time with a piping hot mug of herbal goodness in our hands. Herbal teas and honeys are another way for you to support, stimulate, and warm the body. These recipes are simple and effective and will keep you and your loved ones bundled up from the inside out this season. Try turning one (or more!) of these recipes into a cute, thoughtful gift this holiday season! They pack nicely into jars, and you can wrap it all up with a label and bow for some festive finishing touches. Stay warm and cozy during these days when the sun is low and the days are short. Drink up! * The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that you do not feed babies honey until they are one-year-old. Honey is safe for people one year of age and older.64Essential oils are one of the many gifts from nature.

Precious indeed, this steam distilled oil is prized for its sweet, rosy, floral scent. Recommended Scent Replacements: Rose absolute is solvent extracted, resulting in a higher-yield. This middle note has a full-bodied, alluring, rosy fragrance. Geranium essential oil has a bright floral scent and is often utilized as a substitute for rose. Also considered a middle note, it is wise to exercise caution as this oil can be overpowering due to its high aromatic strength. Palmarosa essential oil has a sweet, floral, geranium-like scent although it is slightly more robust in smell compared to rose. Recommended Constituent/Action Replacements: Geranium essential oil Citronella essential oil Palmarosa essential oil5BULGARIAN ROSE ESSENTIAL OIL SUBSTITUTES Helichrysum essential oil is another unique scent that is difficult to replace due to its earthy, sweet, and dry floral notes. I recommend blending a combination of clary sage and either bergamot or carrot seed essential oil. Recommended Scent Replacements: Clary sage essential oil is slightly more herbaceous and less floral than helichrysum but is similar in its earthy and bittersweet floral notes. Carrot seed essential oil has complex middle notes with earthy, warm, and spicy aromatics. It pairs well with clary sage to replicate helichrysum's mellow, floral fragrance profile. Bergamot essential oil boasts bright and uplifting floral notes. Its underlying citrus spice scent plays well with clary sage to mimic an earthy, yet floral smell. Recommended Constituent/Action Replacements: Rosemary essential oil Fir needle essential oil Frankincense essential oil Carrot seed essential oilLemon balm essential oil has a fresh, herbaceous, citrus fragrance which leaves plenty of room for replacement exploration based on personal preference. Try citrus if looking for a pick-me-up; lemon tea tree or lemongrass for an herbal lemon aroma; or I find litsea cubeba, sweet marjoram, or coriander to be similar as well. Recommended Scent Replacements: Lemon essential oil has a bright and uplifting citrusy scent, often used as a pick-me-up, top-note fragrance. Lemon tea tree essential oil is not a blend but a single species of plant in the same family as tea tree oil. Its herbaceous yet uplifting lemon aroma is a close replacement. Lemongrass essential oil is another close substitute for lemon balm and has a similar calming effect. Litsea cubeba essential oil has enticing earthy, spicy, green aromas with a nice lemony top note. Its complexity is reminiscent of lemon balm. Coriander seed essential oil is wonderfully earthy and sweet with a hint of citrus. Try blending this unique fragrance with lemon or lemongrass essential oil. Recommended Constituent/Action Replacements: Litsea cubeba essential oil Lemon tea tree essential oil 34 HELICHRYSUM ESSENTIAL OIL SUBSTITUTESLEMON BALM ESSENTIAL OIL SUBSTITUTES With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm.

Plant material that is expertly distilled and bottled results in a potent scent that can be used in aromatherapy, body care recipes, and for pure enjoyment. But some of these precious essential oils are just that: precious. They can fetch a high price tag for various reasons including the oil content of the botanical or even the extraction method. Pure, quality essential oils, like the ones we sell at Mountain Rose Herbs, may be slightly more costly but the result is a deeper, richer aroma, and a profound aromatherapeutic benefit. ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP CONSIDERATIONS While there are no exact replacements for a particular fragrance, it is possible to achieve a relatively close scent profile. These recommended scent substitutions are based purely on aroma alone and are my personal suggestions. This list is a good place to start, but you could do some additional experimentation on your own. Not only is it fun, but it's a great way to find what works with your personal perfume preferences. When applicable, I've also listed constituent and action replacements. Sometimes a particular essential oil is used for its chemical make up or to achieve a specified action. This is helpful if you're seeking essential oils that can be substituted for their desired therapeutic effects. While these replacements mimic the aroma of a treasured oil, sometimes a scent substitute just doesn't cut it. Four of the five oils on our list are available as a roll-on essential oil, providing these amazing scents in an attainable and easy-to-use way. THE ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP LIST Without further ado, here is the list I've complied of essential oil alternatives for five of the most high-priced oils we offer: vanilla absolute, jasmine absolute, helichrysum essential oil, lemon balm essential oil, and Bulgarian rose essential oil. With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm. A cup of herbal tea with a bit of honey can be just the thing to heat the body and soul right up. I love making warming herbal teas this time of year as the beneficial herbs and spices are wonderful for stimulating circulation, warding off seasonal sniffles, and supporting digestion. On a chilly day, a cup can make you feel bundled and help support your immune system at the same time. One of the best parts of making herbal teas and honeys is that they are easy and quick to whip up. Most of the recipes only have a few ingredients and will just take a few minutes of your time. You can make one mug or brew a pot to enjoy throughout the day.

WRITTEN BY DR. CRYSTAL DAWN SILASUNDERSTANDING HERBAL ACTIONS AND HOW THEY SUPPORT THE MICROBIOME We now know that microflorae in our gut, which have evolved in a symbiotic relationship with us over time, directly influence\u2014either positively or negatively\u2014every aspect of our health and wellbeing, including our digestion, immune functions, neurological and emotional health, hormonal balance, cardiovascular strength, and more. Attracting beneficial microflorae (the ones that flip the genetic switches toward health and balance) is a matter of making healthy food and lifestyle choices. In other words, what we eat tips the scales towards wellbeing or dis-ease. When we choose to eat an organic plant-based diet high in phytonutrients, antioxidants, and dietary fiber, we attract a much more diverse, healthy, and resilient microbiome, which in turn strengthens our defenses against illness and unhealthy aging. In this line of defense, carminative, nervine, bitter, and demulcent herbs can be leveraged much like secret agents who step in to fend off undesirable effects.NERVINES Nervines are relaxing herbs that are often tonic or specifically supportive of the nervous system. Many of these herbs possess both carminative qualities that affect our digestive systems and nervine properties that ease stress and relax the nerves. The natural synergy in the plant makes these herbs particularly well-suited to problems involving the gut-brain axis. Consider these organic nervine herbs: Celery seed Chamomile Hawthorn Hyssop Lavender BITTERS Bitters are stimulating to the secretions of the stomach, pancreas, liver, and small intestines, and they increase our ability to digest and assimilate our food. Use bitters when there is indigestion, heartburn, poor fat digestion, or constipation. Consider these mucilaginous herbs. Made up of branched carbohydrate molecules that easily trap water and other molecules, which cause them to swell and become soft, they are high in polysaccharides-rich mucilage. Demulcents reinforce the intestinal mucous layer that is both food and home for beneficial microflora in the gut, and they also increase the numbers and diversity of beneficial microbiota. Demulcents have a soothing effect on contact throughout the entire digestive tract, and they offer water-soluble fiber that bulks and softens stool. Use demulcents to support a healthy bowel and when any of the GI tract mucous membranes are irritated, from the throat on down. Consider these organic demulcent herbs: Chia seed Flax seed Marshmallow root Oats Plantain leaves, roots, and seeds Slippery elm bark* * Use sustainably sourced herb only. This plant is on United Plant Savers' At-Risk list (see page 25).How Herbal Actions Support Gut Health Herbal \"actions\" are a set of common terms that refer to the properties associated with particular herbs. Understanding these terms helps us determine proper use, informs us in formulation decisions, and presents us with options when we need to substitute one herb for another. Many times, a single herb will have a variety of actions, which can be key in feeding a healthy microbiome. In terms of positively influencing the microflorae in our gut, we are most interested in herbal actions that include carminative, nervine, bitter, and demulcent herbs. CARMINATIVES Carminatives are aromatic herbs containing volatile oils. These small molecules help relieve intestinal gas, tension, and spasms and promote intestinal motility. They help the digestive process function smoothly and with ease. Use carminatives when there is gas, irritability, fluctuating stool frequency and/or consistency, bloating, cramps, or flatulence. Consider these organic carminative herbs: Anise Seed Caraway Seed Chamomile Flower Cumin Seed Coriander Seed Clove Dill Fennel Seed Garlic Ginger root Lemon balm Marjoram Motherwort Mustard Nutmeg OnionWhen we have the foundational knowledge of herbal actions, we are better able to understand how and when to use our botanical allies. Calling upon a large list of herbs and spices that are carminatives, nervines, bitters, and/or demulcents can bring support to our microbiome. We know that much of our wellness is linked to balanced gut flora, so taking care of it is one of the best ways we can support our overall health. With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm. A cup of herbal tea with a bit of honey can be just the thing to heat the body and soul right up.

ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP CONSIDERATIONS While there are no exact replacements for a particular fragrance, it is possible to achieve a relatively close scent profile. These recommended scent substitutions are based purely on aroma alone and are my personal suggestions. This list is a good place to start, but you could do some additional experimentation on your own. Not only is it fun, but it's a great way to find what works with your personal perfume preferences. When applicable, I've also listed constituent and action replacements. Sometimes a particular essential oil is used for its chemical make up or to achieve a specified action. This is helpful if you're seeking essential oils that can be substituted for their desired therapeutic effects. While these replacements mimic the aroma of a treasured oil, sometimes a scent substitute just doesn't cut it. Four of the five oils on our list are available as a roll-on essential oil, providing these amazing scents in an attainable and easy-to-use way. THE ESSENTIAL OIL SWAP LIST Without further ado, here is the list I've complied of essential oil alternatives for five of the most high-priced oils we offer: vanilla absolute, jasmine absolute, helichrysum essential oil, lemon balm essential oil, and Bulgarian rose essential oil. With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm. A cup of herbal tea with a bit of honey can be just the thing to heat the body and soul right up. I love making warming herbal teas this time of year as the beneficial herbs and spices are wonderful for stimulating circulation, warding off seasonal sniffles, and supporting digestion. On a chilly day, a cup can make you feel bundled and help support your immune system at the same time. One of the best parts of making herbal teas and honeys is that they are easy and quick to whip up. Most of the recipes only have a few ingredients and will just take a few minutes of your time. You can make one mug or brew a pot to enjoy throughout the day. HERBAL TEA RECIPES Here are some of my favorite go-to herbal tea recipes to stay snuggled up and healthy during the colder days. Who else loves the juicy, bright taste of orange during the darker days? Orange peels are another excellent boost of the vitamin C that our bodies crave during winter. They also contain pectin, which feeds the beneficial bacteria in the gut, making it nurturing for digestion and the immune system. Makes about 8 oz. INGREDIENTS 2 Tbsp. freshly chopped organic orange peel OR 1 Tbsp. dried organic orange peel 1 cup water DIRECTIONS 1.If you choose to use fresh orange peels, chop them into quarter-inch pieces. With dried orange peels, you can crush them up a little with a mortar and pestle. 2.Place chopped or crushed orange peels and water into a pot and cover with a lid. Stainless steel, glass, and enamel pots all work very well. 3.Bring to a boil then immediately turn off the heat. 4.Let the infusion steep for 1 hour. Strain out the herbs. 5.Enjoy immediately or store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Re-warm tea when ready to drink.ORANGE PEEL TEA If you fancy a cup of joe when it's bitter cold, this recipe is for you. I've recommended this delicious warm drink for years in my herbal consultation practice. It's the perfect substitute for caffeine drinkers and carries a bitter flavor that wakes up the gut and gets your system moving, which is often what we look for with morning coffee. The cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg garnish bring in some antimicrobial action and leave us with thoughts of cozying up by the fire. Makes about 24 oz. INGREDIENTS 1/2 cup organic raw milk or almond milk 3 cups water 3 Tbsp. roasted organic dandelion root 1 Tbsp. organic cacao nibs 1/2 tsp. organic cinnamon powder 1/2 tsp. organic vanilla extract 2 Tbsp. organic barley malt syrup 1 Tbsp. organic maple syrup (optional, for more sweetness) Dash organic clove powder Dash organic nutmeg powder DIRECTIONS 1.Add milk, water, dandelion root, and cacao nibs to a pot and bring to a boil. 2.Turn off the heat and steep for 30 minutes. 3.Strain the herbs from the tea and stir in the remaining ingredients. 4.Reheat to your desired temperature and enjoy with your hands wrapped around a nice warm mug. DANDELION MOCHA Evergreen trees such as pine, cedar, and fir nourish us with their color and scent, but they also have valuable therapeutic qualities to nurture our bodies. This Winter Tree Tea is very supportive when you're dealing with a runny-nose and phlegm. Makes about 16 oz. INGREDIENTS 2 cups water 2 Tbsp. fresh or dried chopped pine needles 1 Tbsp. raw honey DIRECTIONS 1.Put water and pine needles in a pot and cover with a lid. 2.Bring to a boil and immediately turn off the heat. 3.Let the infusion sit for 1 hour. Using a metal strainer, strain out the pine needles. 4.Re-heat to your desired temperature, sweeten as desired, and drink 1 to 3 cups a day as needed. PRO TIP This tea can be a bit drying to the body, so drink only on occasion and only for a couple of days at a time. WINTER TREE TEA RECIPES BY KAMI McBRIDEHERBAL HONEY RECIPES* Honey is an ingredient that many people have in the cupboard. You want to use raw honey when working with herbs because heating honey through the pasteurization process removes some of the beneficial health effects that support our bodies. Adding herbs to honey is very simple and will take the honey's therapeutic value to the next level. I love to have a few herbal honeys in the pantry and on the kitchen table as they are very shelf-stable and can be conveniently added to a range of breakfast items. In a jar, herbal honey can easily last for a year, although you may need to stir up the herbs every once in a while. Herbal honey can be added to flavor any tea or can make a great tea on its own. Herbal honeys also make great gifts as we head into the holiday season! Enjoy these herbal honey recipes by the spoonful or in your favorite herbal tea! The darker days inspire more respite and more time with a piping hot mug of herbal goodness in our hands. Herbal teas and honeys are another way for you to support, stimulate, and warm the body.

None of the statements in this catalog have been evaluated by the Food and Drug AdministrationWe are proud to offer the first Certified Forest Grown American Ginseng in partnership with the United Plant Savers. This project brings us organically grown ginseng plants that are cultivated in their native ecosystem. The roots and leaves are sustainably harvested from private forests that are stewarded by farmers dedicated to preserving this important medicinal plant for the future. Mountain Rose Herbs will donate 5% from every sale of this precious ginseng root to the United Plant Savers. We believe that supporting this effort can change the culture of ginseng throughout Appalachia, transforming the epidemic of black market poaching into a stewarded forest crop with sustainability as the guiding force.FOREST GROWNAMERICAN GINSENG American Ginseng Root Whole $44.50 10 grams AMERICAN GINSENG Root Whole $44.50 MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 171 ANSWER KEY: 1.

MOUNTAIN ROSE HERBS JOURNAL | ISSUE 2 | 2022 | 173With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm. A cup of herbal tea with a bit of honey can be just the thing to heat the body and soul right up. I love making warming herbal teas this time of year as the beneficial herbs and spices are wonderful for stimulating circulation, warding off seasonal sniffles, and supporting digestion. On a chilly day, a cup can make you feel bundled and help support your immune system at the same time. One of the best parts of making herbal teas and honeys is that they are easy and quick to whip up. Most of the recipes only have a few ingredients and will just take a few minutes of your time. You can make one mug or brew a pot to enjoy throughout the day. HERBAL TEA RECIPES Here are some of my favorite go-to herbal tea recipes to stay snuggled up and healthy during the colder days.HERBAL HONEY RECIPES* Honey is an ingredient that many people have in the cupboard. You want to use raw honey when working with herbs because heating honey through the pasteurization process removes some of the beneficial health effects that support our bodies. Adding herbs to honey is very simple and will take the honey's therapeutic value to the next level. I love to have a few herbal honeys in the pantry and on the kitchen table as they are very shelf-stable and can be conveniently added to a range of breakfast items. In a jar, herbal honey can easily last for a year, although you may need to stir up the herbs every once in a while. Herbal honey can be added to flavor any tea or can make a great tea on its own. Herbal honeys also make great gifts as we head into the holiday season! Enjoy these herbal honey recipes by the spoonful or in your favorite herbal tea! The darker days inspire more respite and more time with a piping hot mug of herbal goodness in our hands. Herbal teas and honeys are another way for you to support, stimulate, and warm the body. These recipes are simple and effective and will keep you and your loved ones bundled up from the inside out this season. Try turning one (or more!) of these recipes into a cute, thoughtful gift this holiday season! They pack nicely into jars, and you can wrap it all up with a label and bow for some festive finishing touches. Stay warm and cozy during these days when the sun is low and the days are short. Drink up! * The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that you do not feed babies honey until they are one-year-old. Honey is safe for people one year of age and older. With the season shifting and the brisk weather blowing in, we start looking for ways to cozy up and stay warm.

UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN This fourth issue of the Mountain Rose Herbs Journal + Catalog marks two years that we've been bringing together some of the finest herbalists to share knowledge and skills. This Journal is an extension of the work we've been doing for more than two decades: finding new ways to provide herbalism access to a wider array of people and providing important information about sustainability. The Journal also gives us space to showcase extraordinary writers, photographers, and other creatives who have a passion for the botanical world. Thank you for going on this journey with us\u2014you all make it so much fun! We want to take this last moment to let you know what else we're up to. With the COVID social distancing mandates behind us at last, we've been able to reopen the Mountain Rose Herbs Annex to our community for free events. We have dedicated this space to creating and providing accessible educational resources for herbalists, homesteaders, foodies, DIY explorers, and anyone seeking a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. We're also hosting a Sunday Annex Series\u2014a weekly class held every Sunday from 1-3 p.m.. Here, people can learn from local teachers, businesses, and botanically-minded folks about herbalism, healthy living, and more. Find out more by visiting the Mercantile event calendar at: mountainroseherbsmercantile.com/events-calendar. On the herbal-goodness front, we're excited to announce that we're developing a new line of combination herbal capsules! We'll keep you posted as we work out the details. Finally, we're excited to continue providing free herbal education classes both online and in-person. The Free Herbalism Project (FHP) is an interactive community event with botanically inspired lectures from experts, as well as live music, community, and plenty of organic herbal tea\u2014all free of charge. Like the Journal and the Annex, FHP is one of the ways in which Mountain Rose Herbs gives back to herbalists and our local communities.UNWANTED MAILINGS We don't want to waste paper or add to your junk mail.
