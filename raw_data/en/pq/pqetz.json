Types of Treatments One of our main treatments is chiropractic adjustments. A traditional approach doesn't use any tools, but instead, focuses on the proper alignment of the spine with controlled force. During this treatment, a chiropractor on our chiropractic care team will ask you to lie on a table and then will use manual manipulation to adjust the spine. This can help correct the alignment of the spine and help ease pressure on the nearby nerves and soft tissue. This can also help optimize circulation throughout the area as well as nervous system function. Another common treatment we use is corrective exercise. A chiropractor on our team will ask you to perform stretches that focus on the affected part of the body. The stretches go slowly and will gradually increase in difficulty as you heal. You're building the tissue stronger as you progress, encouraging it to heal. We may also recommend lifestyle changes you can make as a way to help achieve chronic pain relief. This may include changes in nutrition. Much of your overall health and wellness depends on your nutrition. We understand this can use our expertise to help you make the right choices.
