BKPyV is only known to infect h umans and seroprevalence rates of more than 90% have been reported in adult populations around the world. Following primary infection, BKPyV persists in the renourinary tract without causing any disease as evidenced by urinary shedding in 5% - 10% of healthy immunocompetent blood donors. In immunocompromised persons, however, BKPyV can ca use significant diseases whereby uncontrolled high-level replication may lea d to organ invasive pathologies in kidneys, bladder, lungs, vasculature, and the centr al nervous system. The most consistently found diseases are BKPyV-associated he morrhagic cystitis (BKPyVHC) in 5%-20% allogeneic hematopoietic and BKPyV- associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN) in 1%-15% of kidne y transplant patients. BKPyVHC is highly symptomatic with pain, anemic ble eding, and increased mortality. BKPyVAN is asymptomatic except for progressive rena l failure and premature return to dialysis. Both entities are characterized by hig h-level viral replication i.e. with urine BKPyV loads of 8-10 log 10 Geq/mL, plasma BKPyV loads often above 4 log 10 Geq/mL, and an allogeneic constellation between the virus-infected host cell and the available T-cell effectors. Despite these similarit ies, the clinical manifestations are strikingly different suggesting relevant, but exper imentally undefined differences in pathogenesis. Thus, BKPyVHC typically occurs within 4 weeks after allogeneic HSCT and is confined to the bladder, and typically without kidney involvement. By contrast, BKPyVAN is diagnosed around 3-6 months af ter kidney transplantation and confined to the kidney allograft without causing cy stitis. Although high-level BKPyV replication should be formally amenable to antivira l drug treatment, no effective and BKPyV-specific antiviral therapy is currently avail able. Therefore, a better understanding of the immune alteration in both dise ases has been deemed essential to identify patients at risk and to develop prophyl actic, preemptive and therapeutic strategies. The currently recommended strategy for BKPyVAN is t o screen kidney transplant patients for BKPyV replication and to promptly redu ce immunosuppressive therapy in those with significant replication to facilitate mo unting of BKPyV-specific T cell responses and thereby preventing progression to dis ease. This manoeuver has been linked to expanding BKPyV-specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood of kidney transplant patients. However, this approach may place patients at risk for 9acute rejection episodes that predispose equally we ll to premature kidney transplant failure. Although the clinical feasibility of reduc ing immunosuppression and curtailing BKPyV replication has been shown to be effective in prospective cohort studies for many, but not all of kidney transplant patients, th is approach has not been possible in allogeneic HSCT patients because of concurrent or i mminent graft-versus host disease. Thus, there are significant gaps in the cu rrent understanding of the BKPyV- host interaction in the normal host and in the allo geneic setting, which need to be investigated for a more effective and safer managem ent of these significant viral complications. In this thesis, the interaction of BKPyV and the im mune response has been approached from two different angles. In the first project, potential mechanisms of BKPyV immune evasion were studied. Here, we focused on a small accessory protein called agnoprotein encoded as a leader prot ein in the late viral early region (LVGR). Although HPyV genomes overall show a very s imilar genome organization, agnoproteins are only found in the genomes of BKPyV and JCPyV that have a kidney tropisms, but not in any of the other 11 pre sumably non-renotropic HPyVs. We hypothesized that agnoprotein could play a role in immune evasion by downregulating HLA expression. The effects of agnop rotein were studied on HLA class I and II expression in vitro by flow cytometry following transfection of primar y human renal tubular epithelial cells, which are the viral target of BKPyV-associated nephropathy. In addition, transfected human UTA-6 c ells were studied as well as UTA-6 cells bearing a tetracycline-regulated agnopr otein. As control, the effects were compared with the ICP47 protein of Herpes simplex v irus-1, which has been previously reported to effectively down-regulate HL A class I. Although both viral proteins share some similarities at the protein lev el, our results showed that BKPyV agnoprotein did not down-regulate HLA class I or cl ass II molecules. Also, there was not inhibitory effect on the increase of HLA-class I or class-II surface expression following exposure to interferon- . By contrast, ICP47 reduced HLA class I surface expression, but not class II. We also evaluated eff ects of agnoprotein on virus epitope-specific T-cell killing by 51 Chromium release assay, however no interference could be observed. We concluded that agnoprotein di d not contribute to these types of HLA-dependent immune evasion processes. However, further investigations are needed to understand if agnoprotein could contribut e to viral immune escape by other mechanisms. In the second project, we aimed at better character izing BKPyV-specific CD8 T cell immunity targeting epitopes encoded in the early vi ral gene region (EVGR). Selected coding sequences of the BKPyV EVGR were submitted t o two web-based computer 10 algorithms (SYFPEITHI, IEDB) in order to predict im munodominant 9mer epitopes presented by 14 frequent HLA-class I molecules. For an experimental confirmation, 97 different 9mer epitopes were chemically synthesi zed and tested in 42 healthy individuals. A total of 39 epitopes could be confi rmed by interferon- ELISpot assay in at least 30% of healthy individuals. Interesting ly, most of the 9mer epitopes appeared to cluster in short amino acid stretches, and some 9mer could be presented by more than one HLA class I allele as ex pected for immunodominant domains. HLA-specific presentation (54%) epitopes. by 51 Chromium release assay and the CD107a surface detection indicated th at the 9mer epitopes could be recognized by cytotoxic T-cells. Moving to a clinic ally relevant situation, 13 9mer epitopes could be validated in 19 kidney transplant patients protected from, or recovering from, BKPyV viremia. The results suggest that, pending further corroboration in larger patient populations, novel 9mer epitopes can be identified, which are associated with CD8 T cell control of BKP yV replication. Thus the identified immunodominant 9mer T-cell epitopes coul d be further developed for clinical assays to better predict the risk and the recovery of BKPyV diseases, help guiding immunosuppression reduction, and to develop specific adoptive T-cell therapy or vaccine responses to prevent or treat BK PyV-associated diseases. 11 3 Introduction 3.1 Virus-host interaction Viruses are among the smallest of all self-replicat ing organisms present in nature, being constituted in the most basic cases by a litt le as a small segment of nucleic acid encapsidated in a protein shell. Viruses do no t have their own metabolism, rather they need to parasitize cells and subvert th eir intracellular machinery in order to replicate and possibly transmit to new potential hosts (Walsh and Mohr 2011). Hosts and their cells, on the other hand, have deve loped defense mechanisms in order to protect from virus infection and the assoc iated damage resulting from virus replication. The infection of a specific host cell (cell tropism ) depends mainly on the presence of the appropriate receptors on the cell surface, to w hich the virus must attach in order to gain entry into the cell. Upon cell entry, in c ase of lytic infection, the cellular replication machinery is redirected, resulting in v iral genome replication, with consequent protein synthesis, assembling and packag ing into new viral particles, and finally exit the cell. In the case of latent infec tion, viruses express no or only latency associated genes causing hardly or no damage to the host cell. Latent or persistent, viruses need to avoid immune recognition; therefore they have evolved mechanisms of immune escape, which may involve dedicated immun e evasion proteins. As disadvantage, no active virus transmission occurs d uring latency phase. Viral evolution, which involves the parallel genera tion of different viral variants constituting a viral swarm called quasispecies, is important for successful spreading in a given host and counteracting host cell defense s. Rapid generation of viral mutant variants may permit escape from host cell defenses, and more efficient replication capacity (viral fitness) (Domingo 2007, Ojosnegros, Perales et al. 2011). In the next paragraphs, aspects of how viruses and hosts interact are presented as well as how the immune system responds to infection , where and why the immune system can fail in mounting an efficient response, and how it can overcome these challenges. This knowledge is deemed essential for finding better strategies to prevent viral replication and disease (Ayres AnnuRe vImmunol2012). 12 3.1.1 Host immune response to viruses Once a virus infects a host, it eventually needs to enter the relevant host cells in order to survive, replicate, and produce viral prog eny. The host needs to build up an effective defense mechanism to protect himself agai nst the devastating effects of viral infection, and such protective responses are mediated by the immune system (Hirsch 2005). In humans as a member of the mammalian species, the immune system is organized in two main compartments, which act in a cooperativ e and often sequential way: 1) The innate immune system, which detects the pres ence of \"non-self\" through germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors distinguish nonself- molecules from self-molecules (Brubaker, B onham et al. 2015), and consequently initiates mechanisms aiming at elimina te pathogens. Innate immunity also activates adaptive immune responses. 2) The adaptive immune system, which at the first e ncounter with the \"non-self\" entity acts as a second line of defense, is characterized by antigen-specificity and immunological memory. Immunological memory describe s the observation that once an antigen is encountered for a second or repeated time, the adaptive immune response is faster and more effective (Zielinski, C orti et al. 2011). 3.1.1.1 Innate immunity Epithelial barriers on all body surfaces, e.g. on t he skin, eyes, in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, act as a first line of defe nse to prevent virus entry and spread within the host. These barriers together with mecha nical and biochemical clearance through pH and enzymes are considered part of the u nspecific defense. Once the pathogen succeeds in entering through the anatomica l barriers, a rapid innate immune response may start immediately (Brubaker, Bo nham et al. 2015). The first innate components include preformed solub le molecules and epithelial secretions: lysozyme that is an antimicrobial enzym e able to digest bacterial cell walls, defensins which are peptides that can lyse b acterial cell membranes, and the complement system, which is constituted by several plasma proteins acting hierarchically and sequentially, targeting pathogen s for both direct lysis and phagocytosis by cells of the innate immune. 13 The cellular effectors of the innate immune respons e consist of natural (NK) a nd eosinophils. These cells are able to recognize viruses as non-self. Typical path ogen structures, viral proteins and nucleic acids (named as pathogen-associated molecul ar patterns-PAMPs) can be distinguished from cellular counterparts by cellula r PRR, present either in the cell cytoplasm or on cellular membranes, where they dete ct viral components. 3.1.1.1.1 Sensors of \"non-self\" in the innate immun e response Most PRRs can be included into one of five families according to their protein domain homology: there are Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-t (RLRs), and the AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) (Figure 1). According to cellular localization, the y can be divided in two main classes: unbound intracellular receptors (NLRs, RLRs, 2011 ). TLRs and CLRs are found at the cell surface or on endocytic compartments. Thes e receptors detect the presence of microbial ligands in the extracellular space and within endosomes. The RLRs, and ALRs sense the presence of intracellular pathogens. Sensing of PAMPs by PRRs leads to the production of chemical message s, proinflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFN), that are crucial for initiat ing and modulating immune responses, and aiming at containing the spread of a n initial infection (Takeuchi and Akira 2010) (Figure 1). The RLR family consists of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5). These proteins are composed of two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARD), a central DEAD box helicase/ATPase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (Kawai a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). These types of RNAs are usually not found in the cytoplasm of unin fected cells; rather they are typically products of viral replication. Once RIG-I binds viral RNAs, the CARD domain triggers signaling cascades by interacting with the N-terminal CARD-containing adaptor IFN- -promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), which is the membrane, and subsequentially activates the transcr iption factors IRF-3 and NF-kB, leading to the synthesis of type 1 IFN and other pr oinflammatory cytokines. It has also been reported that RIG-I can be activated in p resence of DNA virus, a template 14 of dsDNA is converted into dsRNA by RNA polymerase III DNA sensor, activating RIG-I and subsequently leading to the induction of type I IFNs (Chiu, Macmillan et al. 2009). Figure 1: Summary of pattern recognition receptors and activation of innate immune responses . NOD1 and NOD2 are key members of the NLR family (Sa leh 2011). They are cytosolic proteins constituted by C-terminal ligand -binding LRRs, a central domain, and a single (NOD1) or two (NOD2) N-termina l CARD domains. They are involved in detection of components of bacterial ou ter membrane. Upon binding, interactions via CARD domain trigger NF-kB pathway and production of proinflammatory cytokines (Park, Kim et al. 2007). However, NOD1 and NOD2 can also eliminate pathogens independently from NF-kB, by inducing autophagy, which is a process in which self-proteins and damaged organe lles family AIF2 and IFI16, two recept ors having a PYHIN domain for protein-protein interactions and a DNA-binding HIN- 200 domain, involved in sensing cytoplasmic DNA, as viral DNA viruses. Upon detecti on of DNA, AIF2 promotes the 15 inflammasome formation. This multiprotein complex m ediates the start of an innate immune response characterized by the secretion of p roinflammatory cytokines and a rapid form of cell death (pyroptosis) that contribu tes to inflammation (Lamkanfi activates formation , and interacts with STING (stimulator of IFN gene), that by activating IRF3 l eads to the production of IFN. CLRs recognize a wide range of microorganisms, incl uding fungi and bacteria, and all share a characteristic C-type lectin-like domai n. Dectin-1 is a member of CLRs and recognizes mainly fungal antigens, upon binding it promotes ligand uptake by phagocytosis and the initiation of a signaling casc ade that regulates gene expression and cytokine production. Other important detectors of viruses are among the membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLRs), which sense viral glycoproteins, dsRNA, ssRNA, and the CpG sequence in viral DNA (Szabo and Rajnavolgyi 2013). At least 10 TLRs have been identified in humans, characterized by an extracell ular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an TLR6, and TLR1 1 are cell surface, while TLR3, TLR7,TLR9 and TLR10 are locali zed within cytoplasmic endosomes Funami et al. 2003, Takeuchi and Akira 2010). TLRs can activate different transcript ional responses depending on which adaptor set is utilized. Among the TLR family members, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, recognize nucleic acids derived from viru ses and TLR9 is the most important in sensing viral DNA, as it can detect Cp G DNA sequences, which are characteristic of viral genomes, in fact it has bee n shown that TLR9 is involved in recognition of DNA viruses, such as hepatitis B vir us (HBV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and Epstein- Barr virus (EBV). It has been demonstrated the importance of TLR9 als o in human polyomaviruses (HPyV), in fact a recent report demonstrated the ex pression of TLR2, 4, 5, 7 and 9 in Merkel Cell Carcinoma tumor specimen, but a decreas ed expression of TLR9 correlated ( MCPyV) positivity (Jouhi, Koljonen et al. 2015). In another study it has been shown t hat Large T antigen of MCPyV was the responsible for a decreased TLR9 expression, an d the same observation was done for BKPyV, although at a lower extent (Shahzad , Shuda et al. 2013). Sensing of viral DNA induces trafficking of TLR9 fr om the endoplasmic reticulum to the endolysosome, a subsequent cleavage by protease s present in the endolysosome, and recruitment of a complex of prote ins including MyD88, an 16 adaptor protein displaying a TIR domain. Its activa tion can trigger a signaling cascade leading to NF-kb translocation into the nuc leus and subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes, or another pathw ay leading to IRF7 phosphorylation, with consequent upregulation of th e expression of type I IFN genes (Takeuchi and Akira 2010). 3.1.1.1.2 Effectors of innate immune activation Interferons play an important role in the resistanc e against viral infection by binding to a common cell surface receptor on the infected c ell as well as on neighbouring uninfected cells (Akira and Takeda 2004). Interfero n family is constituted by distinct proteins grouped into three classes according to th eir receptor complexes. Type I IFNs includes in humans IFN- , IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, only by IFN - , and type III IFN is represented by IFN- . Type I IFNs signal through heterodimeric receptor complexes. For type I IFN, the receptor is constituted by the IFN- receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2 subunits. Type II I FNs signal through heterodimers consisting of IFN- receptors 1 (IFNGR1) and 2 (IFNGR2), whereas type III IFN signal through interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) and IFN- receptor 1 (IFNLR1) heterodimers. Engagement of both type I an d type III IFNs to their receptors triggers phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 and tyrosine kinase which in turn phosphorylate the receptors a nd leads to the recruitment and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and 2). A heterodimer constituted by STAT1 and 2 recrui ts the IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (IS GF3). Binding of type II IFN dimers to the IFNGR1/2 leads to phosphorylation of JAK1 Phosphorylated homodimers form Both ISGF3 and GAF transl ocate to the nucleus and permit expression of genes regul ated by IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS) promoter elements, respectively, resulting in expression of antiviral genes (Schneider, Chevillotte et al. 2014). In theory all humans cells can synthesize IFN /, however some cells show a better ability to produce these cytokines, as the precurso rs of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC). As main function, IFN- and IFN- interfere with virus replication in neighboring, not yet infected cells by activating a set of antiviral functions. This includes gene product leading to the destruction of mRNAs and inhibiting the 17 translation of viral proteins. They can induce majo r histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in most cell types, and increase the synthesis of MHC class I molecules in newly infected cells, so that they can be more easily recognized by CD8 cytotoxic T cells (Schneider, Chevillotte et al. 20 14). IFN / can also activate NK cells, and thereby inducing the killing of infected cells during the innate immune response (Bogdan 2000, Jost and Altfeld 2013). IFN- is induced upon stimulation of epitope-specific T cells and NK cells, resulting in cellular immune responses, activation of macrophage s and NK cells, it promotes upregulation of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I and II expression on B cells and macrophages, and at higher levels induce class II on tissue cells to enhance antigen presentation. IFN- is also considered the key cytokine in the T lymph ocyte helpers (Th) Th1 immune response, in fact they secr ete IFN-, which as consequence induces more undifferentiated CD4+ lymp hocytes to differentiate into Th1 cells, in a positive feedback loop way, suppres sing Th2 cell differentiation. The IFN- family is the most recently discovered group of IF Ns, comprising four homologous members. It has been demonstrated that p olymorphisms in IFN- 3 gene, leading to its reduced expression, are associ ated to decreased replication of CMV and lower rates of clearance of HCV (Egli, Sant er et al. 2014). Almost any cell type is able to express IFN- 1-3 in response to viruses, but it is mainly produ ced by DCs (Egli, Santer et al. 2014). DCs are professional antigen presenting cells (APC) , meaning that they can process an antigen and subsequently present it on the cell surface to the T cells. They act as a bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune system. Upon encounter with pathogen they can induce secretion of cytokines (e. g. IFN-), which in turn can activate eosinophils, macrophages, and natural kill er (NK) cells. Following antigen uptake and the respective activation, they migrate to lymphoid organs where, after maturation, they display major histocompatibility c omplexes with the digested peptides to T cells. The recognition of these MHC-p eptide complexes is key to triggering the adaptive immune response. A subset of DCs is constituted by plasmacytoid DCs . They are present in the bone marrow and all periph eral organs, and respond to viral infection with a massive produ ction of type I interferons, however, they also can act as antigen presenting ce lls and control T cell responses. 18 Macrophages can also present antigens, playing a cr ucial role in starting the immune response. Monocytes and macrophages are secretory c ells, producing enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). Monocytes can migrate to tissues and differentiate into DCs, mainly during inflammation processes. NK cells are another key component of innate immuni ty. They display an antigen- independent lytic activity. Their effector function s are the result of the balance of activating and inhibitory signals provided by kille r-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) through the interaction with specific HLA cl ass I ligands. 3.1.1.2 Adaptive immunity d Engagement of such receptors, in the presence of additional signals, activates proliferation, differentiation, and the effector ph ase of the adaptive immune response. The specificity of adaptive immune response is the result of genetic mechanisms occurring during lymphocyte development in the bone marrow and thymus to generate a wide range of variants of the genes enco ding the lymphocyte receptors, known as somatic recombination of variable (V), joi ning (J), and in some cases, diversity (D) gene segments. The main cellular comp onent of adaptive immunity is constituted by lymphocytes, which develop in the th ymus (T lymphocytes), or in the bone marrow (B lymphocytes) and display by receptor s with differentiated structure and function. Lymphocyte antigen receptors, in the form of immuno globulins on B cells and T-cell receptors on T cells (Aleman, Rahbin et al.), are t he means by which lymphocytes detect antigens in their environment. The receptors produced by each lymphocyte are characterized by unique antigen specificity, gi ven by the structure of their antigen-binding site. The range of different antige n specificities in the antigen receptor is due to variation in the amino acid sequ ence at the antigen-binding site, which is constituted by a variable (V) region of th e receptor protein chains. In each chain the V region is linked to an invariant consta nt (C) region, which can provide effector or signaling functions. In B cells, the re arranged V region is known to undergo additional modification, known as somatic h ypermutation, occurring when B cells encounter the antigen and become activated. 19 3.1.1.2.1 T cells T lymphocytes mediate cellular immune responses to antigens, recognized by the T cell receptor (Aleman, Rahbin et al. 2013), heterod imeric molecule composed of two trans-membrane glycoprotein chains, and . The extracellular portion of each chain consists of two domains displaying a V region and a C region, forming antiparallel - sheets. The C region is proximal to the cell membra ne, followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail, while the V re gion is responsible for antigen binding. TCR is noncovalently associated with the n onpolymorphic CD3 proteins forming the TCR complex, needed in the T cell activ ation signaling. T cells also express on their surface co-receptor molecules, nec essary for recognition and activation. During development in the thymus, thymo cytes express both co-receptors CD4 and CD8, then after a positive selection process, cells expressing TCRs with potentially useful ligand specificities are identif ied, and thymocytes resulting from this selection ultimately develop into either CD4 or CD8 expressing cells with a lineage fate determined by the MHC restriction specificity of their TCR. In particular, cells with a MHC class II restricted TCRs differentiate i nto CD4+ T cells, whereas those receiving signals through MHC class I will become C D8+ T cells. Transcription and nuclear factors are involved in T cell commitment, the most important for CD4+ lineage has been shown to be Th-POK, a zinc finger protein, whereas RUNX transcription factors lead the commitment to CD8+, by binding a sequence in the gene encoding for Th-POK, inhibiting its expression . Also GATA3, an enhancer- binding zinc-finger protein, has an important role in CD4 lineage choice, in fact its sustained expression blocks the generation of CD8+ cells (Singer, Adoro et al. 2008). Once T cells have expressed their receptors and co- receptors, they migrate to the periphery and can be activated upon MHC:peptide enc ounter. T cells require three collaborative but distinct signals for efficient ac tivation. The first signal is provided by the engagement of the TCR complex to its specific p eptide antigen, bound to the MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) also through co- receptor molecules, that are CD4 or CD8, expressed at the T cell surface close to the TCR molecule. The second step is a co-stimulatory s ignal provided by engagement of T cell surface receptor CD28 with the specific l igands on APC, that are B7.1 and B7.2 (CD80, CD86), whereas signaling through the TC R alone without signal two can lead to a state of T cell unresponsiveness that is termed anergy or to apoptosis. Antigen recognition by TCR ultimately induces the s ynthesis of transcription factors as NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), that activates transcription of IL-2, leading to cell proliferation. Further co-stimulato ry signals driving proliferation include 20 interaction of CD40 ligand (CD154) with CD40 expres sed on APCs. Upon CD4+ cells can exert their effector func tions, meaning cytotoxic activity and helper function, respectively. The cytokines present in the milieu during the acti vation process lead to CD4+ T cells to differentiate into one of several Th, or peripherally derived regulatory T (Treg ) cells subsets, or even cytotoxic CD4+ cells , for example in presence of IFN and IL-12 commitment towards Th1 cells is driven, while IL-4 leads to Th2, transforming growth factor (TGF)- , Tregs, and IL-2 can lead to cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. Each Th subset is determined by a specific gene expression program, under the control of a lineage-defining transcription factors, which is T-bet, member of th e T box family, for Th1 cells, GATA3 for Th2 cell, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor- t (ROR t) for the Th17 cell lineage, forkhead box P3 eomesodermin (EOMES) for cytotoxic CD4 T cells. The distinct gen e expression profile of CD4+ subsets is defined by the signature cytokines that they express, their distinct homing properties and their specialized effector functions (Swain, McKinstry et al. 2012) (Figure 2). 21 Figure 2: Generation of antiviral CD4+ T cells mod ified from (Swain, McKinstry et al. 2012). Typically, Th1 cells are involved in the immune res ponse to intracellular pathogens, as viruses, through the production of IFN- , TNF-, and IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL -13, evoke stronger antibody responses and are involved in the immune responses against extracellular pathogens and parasites, however Th2 cells are demo nstrated to contribute to antiviral immunity providing efficient help for the generation of neutralizing antibodies. 22 T helper subsets have been identified characterized by proinflammatory IL-17 and IL- 22 production (Th17), mainly involved in autoimmune diseases, and in resistance to extracellular bacterial and fungal infections. Thei r role has been also investigated in the context of viral infection, e.g. in case of HBV , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Their proinflamma tory properties may be detrimental or beneficial, it depends on the diseas e pathogenesis, the tissue damage can caused either by direct virus replication or im munopathology. In the first scenario Th17 could be of help in the disease prevention and /or resolution (Feng, Yin et al. 2015, Mangodt, Van Herck et al. 2015, Wunsch, Zhang et al. 2015). Recently, another CD4+ helper population named Th9 cells has been identified. They secrete IL-9, IL-10 and IL-21, are primed in respon se to TGF- and IL-4 and have been shown to contribute to inflammation in several autoimmune disease models. (Dardalhon, Awasthi et al. 2008). Reports indicate Th9 as major contributors to human atopic disease have been linked to the develo pment of asthma and food allergies in humans, and to the pathogenesis of inf lammatory bowel disease. Conversely, it has been observed that the number of Th9 in patients with melanoma is reduced compared with healthy individuals, sugge sting a protective role (Kaplan, Hufford et al. 2015). Th22, characterized but the production of IL-22 and TNF-, have been only recently identified (Trifari, Kaplan et al. 2009). They have been observed to play an important role in epidermal immunity, remodeling and autoimmu ne diseases (Eyerich, Eyerich et al. 2009), but recent reports have investigated their role in HIV context, in infected patients an impairment of Th22 cells was observed, suggesting a possible protective role (Kim, Nazli et al. 2012). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) include a heterogeneous group of T lymphocytes that are critical for the control of potentially dangerous a utoreactive T cells in the periphery. They play an important role in the immune homeostas is and peripheral self- tolerance. Tregs may not be proper T helper cells, but it is known that inducible Tregs differentiate from the same cell precursor fr om which Th subsets develop. In viral disease they can suppress immunopathology, bu t also cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses, promoting viral replication. For e xample, their role in antiviral immunity has been investigated in the context of ch ronic hepatitis B infection (Peng, Li et al. 2008). In this setting the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on Tregs of patients induced an inhibitory signal i nto effector T cells by the 23 interaction with programmed death-1 (PD-1), correla ting with high levels of markers of liver injury, thus suggesting a contribution of progression of HBV infection (Feng, Cao et al. 2015) (Aubert, Kamphorst et al. 2011). P ersistent infection by EBV can induce increase of Tregs, as observed in patients s uffering from EBV correlated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, such cells can suppress t he proliferation of autologous CD4+CD25- T cells preventing viral clearance (Lau, Cheng et al. 2007), while in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transpl ant and reactivating CMV, Tregs do not inhibit pathogen clearance by effector T cel ls (Velaga, Ukena et al. 2013). CD8+ T cells exert their cytotoxic effector functio n through at least 3 different mechanisms. The first one is the production and cal cium dependent release of specialized lytic granules upon recognition of anti gen. These granules are modified lysosomes that contain cytotoxic effector proteins. One of these cytotoxic proteins, perforin, polymerizes to form trans-membrane pores in target cell membrane, as a consequence water and salts pass rapidly into the c ell, and without integrity of the cell membrane the cell dies rapidly. Other cytotoxi c proteins consist of proteases called granzymes, which enter the targeted cell thr ough perforin induced pores, and upon cleavage of intracellular proteins induce apop tosis. The second way of CD8+ T cell elimination of infect ed cells is via FasL/Fas (CD95ligand/ CD95) interactions. Activated CD8+ T c ells express at their surface FasL which binds to its receptor Fas, that is a mem ber of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily present on the surface of the target cell. The FasL/Fas interaction induces the activation of the caspases 2 and 8, which also results in apoptosis of the target cell. The third cytotoxic mechanism of CD8+ T cells consi sts in secreting cytokines, mainly IFN- and TNF-, contributing to host defense in several ways. IFN - directly inhibits viral replication and upregulates expressi on of MHC class I, increasing the probability that infected cells will be recognized as target cells. IFN- also activates macrophages in synergy with TNF- , recruiting them to sites of infection both as effector cells and as APCs. T cell response after viral clearance is characteri zed by a contraction and resolution phase during which the majority of the effector T c ells die. These cells enter the third stage, the 'memory' phase. Memory T cells are cruci al in case of subsequent encounter with the antigen. In particular T cells in the memory phase can be gr ouped, according their effector functions, and responsiveness to antigen or cytokin es, in effector memory T cells 24 (TEM ) that after being stimulated migrate to the p eriphery and exert immediate effector function, and central memory T cells (TCM) with lower effector function, but high proliferating potential and differentiation in to effector cells upon antigenic stimulation. TCM express CCR7 and CD62L, two homing receptors that are also present in na\u00efve T cells, but differently from thos e, TCM show higher sensitivity to antigenic stimulation and are less dependent on co- stimulation. Upon TCR engagement, TCM produce mainly IL-2, but after prol iferation they efficiently differentiate into effector cells. TEM loose the ex pression of CCR7, are heterogeneous for CD62L expression, and are charact erized by rapid effector function. Some CD8 TEM express CD45RA, and are name d as TEMRA showing the largest amount of cytotoxic granules (Sallusto, Len ig et al. 1999). 3.1.1.2.2 B cells Other essential players in adaptive immunity are B cells, or bone marrow-derived lymphocytes. The maturation of B cells occurs in th e secondary lymphoid organs, as the spleen and lymph nodes, where they can encounte r antigens either soluble or presented by APCs. The antigen is recognized throu gh the B cell receptor (BCR), composed of membrane-bound immunoglobulin. Immunogl obulins of the same antigen specificity are secreted as antibody by ter minally differentiated B cells the plasma cells. The antibody molecule can exert two distinct functi ons: binding specifically to molecules from the pathogen that elicited the immun e response via the V region, and via the C region it can recall other cells and mole cules to eliminate the bound pathogen. Binding by antibody can neutralize viruse s and mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytes and complement. Depending on C region, immunoglobulins can be classified in IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, which are each specialized for activating different effector mecha nisms. The V region of an antibody generally recognizes only a small region on the sur face of a large molecule such as a polysaccharide or protein, termed antigenic determi nant or epitope. B cell maturation following antigen recognition can take place in organized lymphoid structures called germinal centers. Upon binding, t he antigen is endocytosed, degraded and presented on the surface to T helper c ells. During B and T helper cells interaction, CD40 ligand expressed on T cell surfac e binds to CD40 on B cell surface, inducing IL-4 and IL-21 production. Sustained B cel l activation leads to B cell proliferation, induction of somatic hypermutation, resulting in affinity maturation, and 25 class-switch recombination in the immunoglobulin lo cus (Harwood and Batista 2010). Thus, B cell maturation in germinal centers leads t o generation of specific, long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells that circulate in t he blood or migrate to effector sites to confer protective immunity. B cells can a lternatively undergo polyclonal activation and differentiate into short-lived plasm a cells producing low-specificity antibodies, important in the early response towards pathogens (Figure 3). Viral antigen encounter Na\u00efve B cell T cell Germinal centre Long lived memory B cell Long lived class- switched plasma cell Short lived plasma cell Figure 3: B cell differentiation scheme upon antige nic activation. Regarding viral immune response, antibody response is mainly directed towards the viral structural proteins. To induce an efficient a ntiviral response, antibodies have a neutralizing ability, as during this activity antib odies can block viral receptors, interfering with the uncoating of the genomes in en dosomes, or causing aggregation of virus particles. However, non-neutralizing antibodies can still act ivate the complement system, that is an enzymes cascade media ting response against infection, constituted of numerous effector and reg ulatory components. Complement activation has three main pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. Activation of the classical pathway occurs when the fraction C1 binds to antibody or directly to activating surfaces. The lectin pathway is triggered by recognition of carbohydrate residues, found mainly on microbes, by mannose binding lectin, whereas the alternative pathway starts when C3 bind s to a suitable activating surface. The three pathways converge into a final c ommon pathway and lead to the formation of a membrane attack complex, which forms pores on the surface of the targeted cell with consequent lysis. 26 Antibodies can also act by opsonization, a process by which the virus is ingested and destructed by a phagocyte. An antibody-coated virus can be killed by a cytotoxic effector cell also through a non-phagocytic process , characterized by the release of the content of cytotoxic granules or by the express ion of cell death-inducing molecules. Effector cells that mediate antibody dependent cell dendritic cells . Producing antibodies is not the sole role that B ce lls have in anti pathogen immune response, in fact B cells can regulate CD4+ Th cell s by secreting cytokines. According to the specific cytokine they can activat e different Th subsets and specific functions, as for example they can produce IFN- and IL-6 supporting Th1 cells, or secreting IL-2 supporting Th2 pathway and consequen tly also the humoral response (Shen and Fillatreau 2015). 3.1.1.2.3 Antigen processing and presentation to MH C To generate an antigen specific response, lymphocyt es need to encounter the antigen bound to the MHC molecules for T cell activ ation, or also in soluble form regarding B cell activation. There are two classes of MHC molecules, MHC class I and MHC class II which have different structures an d a distinct expression pattern. The MHC complex is encoded as a group of genes, whi ch in humans is located on chromosome 6. The MHC set of alleles present on chr omosome 6, MHC aplotype, is inherited by each parent and co-dominantly expresse d in each individual. The MHC class I gene complex includes three loci A, B and C , as also the class II gene complex, DP, DQ and DR. Many alleles of each locus permit thousands of possible assortments. The MHC class I molecules are expressed in all nucl eated cells. The expression levels depend on the cell differentiation and cell activation. The MHC class I molecule consists of a heterodimer of a constant li ght chain ( 2 microglobulin) which has a domain organization similar to that of an imm unoglobulin C domain and a heavy chain which consists of three domains (alpha1 , 2 and 3), the latter being linked to a transmembrane helix. The structure of MHC class I can be divided in two regions: one region is located near the membrane and consists of the 2 microglobulin and 3 domain spanning 27 the membrane. The second region consists of domains 1 and 2, which form the edges of a pocket on the surface of the molecule; t his is the site of peptide binding (Figure 4). 21 3 2 -microglobulin1 2 2 1 MHC class I MHC class II Figure 4: Schematic representation of MHC class I a nd II domains (upper panels) and the 3D conformation of the peptide binding pockets (lower panels) (adapted from Blum, Wearsch , et al. 2013). The binding of a peptide epitope to the MHC class I complex is stabilized at both ends of the cleft by the contacts between the free N- and C- terminus of the peptide and the invariant sites present at the edges of all MHC class I molecules (Figure 5A). The peptide lies in an elongated conformation alo ng the groove with a usual length of 8-10 aminoacids. Peptides that can bind t o a given MHC allelic variant can share similar amino acid residues at two or three d efined positions along the peptide sequence; as the binding of these side chains ancho rs the peptide to the MHC molecule, such residues are named anchor residues. Both the identity and position and of these residues can vary, depending on the pa rticular MHC class I type, however most of binding peptides have hydrophobic ( or sometimes basic) anchor residue at the carboxy terminus (Figure 6). MHC class II molecules are constitutively expressed in professional APCs, such as B lymphocytes, DCs, and macrophages, however MHC clas s II expression may also be 28 induced on other cells upon IFN- exposure. The MHC class II molecule consists of two trans-membrane glycoprotein chains, and . Each chain has two domains, and the two chains together form a four-domain complex. The 1 and 1domains, sites of major polymorphisms of the molecule, form the groov e for the peptide binding, which, conversely from MHC class I, have open ends, for th is reason peptides binding to MHC class II are longer, at least 13 amino acids (Figure 5B). The binding pockets of MHC class II are more permissive in the accommodati on of amino acid side chains therefore it is more difficult to define anchor res idues. However MHC class II alleles have specific patterns of permissive aa, for exampl e negatively charged aa at the N terminus, and hydrophobic at C terminus, peptides a re usually cleaved by peptidases at 13-17 aa length ( Figure 5B and 6 ). Figure 5: Representation of MHC/peptide complexes. The 9mer peptide lays in the groove of MHC class I with the N and C termini tightly fixed in the edges, and binding it also with anchor residues (A). The open ends of the MHC class II pocket (B) allow peptides to protrude out of the ed ges, and degradation occurs at 13-17 aa length. The binding is mediated through the core a nchor residues. 29 Fig 6 : Peptides binding MHC class I or II molecule s. Upper panel shows different peptides binding to sam e MHC class I allele, displaying similar anchor residues. Lower panel shows different peptid es binding to the same MHC class II allele, with different length, but a similar chore 9mer residues pattern (modified from Immunobiology : the immune system in health and dis ease by Charles A. Janeway, 5th edition, chapter 3). Recognition of peptidic epitopes by TCR occurs when they are bound to an MHC molecule and presented on the cell surface of an AP C. In APCs, different intracellular pathways and mechanisms are responsible for generat ing complexes of MHC class I and II molecules with peptide antigens for presenta tion to T cells (Figure 7). Through antigen processing and presentation, T cells are co ntinuously in touch with the intra and extracellular milieu and can detect signs of in fection or abnormal cell growth. Usually MHC class I peptides derive from endogenou s proteins marked with ubiquitin for destruction by cytoplasmic protein de gradation pathways, and then presented to CD8+ T cells, while MHC class II molec ules are usually associated to peptides derived from endocytosis or phagocytosis o f proteins and presented to CD4+ T cells. However, it is known that APCs can al ert naive CD8 + T cells for presence of neoplastic cells or infected cells thro ugh a mechanism called cross- presentation. In this way APCs take up antigens fro m the extracellular milieu and process them for presentation by MHC class I molecu les to CD8+ T cells (Sigal, Crotty et al. 1999). On the other hand, endogenous and viral proteins ca n generate peptide-MHC class II complexes presented to CD4+ T cells, through a mechanism 30 involving autophagy. A MHC II restricted CD8+ T cyt otoxic response has even been recently observed in the case of monkey vaccination with a cytomegalovirus vector expressing antigens from the simian immunodeficienc y virus (Hansen, Sacha et al. 2013). Once MHC class I molecules are assembled in the end oplasmic reticulum (ER), they are stabilised by chaperone tapasin, MHC class I, ERp57 and calreticulin constitute a complex which is called the peptide-loading complex (PLC). The degra dation of most cellular proteins occurs by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The fir st consists in the conjugation of ubiquitin to the amino group of lysines found in th e protein substrate, allowing rapid degradation of the protein by the proteasome. This process creates a very large number of different peptides, depending on the leng th and sequence of the protein (Rock, York et al. 2004). Viral infection and consequent production of the im mune-modulatory cytokine IFN- by activated T helper type 1 CD4 + lymphocytes, CD8 + CTLs and NKs, can induce expression of several constituents of the proteasom e system (the so called immunosubunits LMP2 and LMP7), which is then turned into a different proteasome, the immunoproteasome, resulting in an enhanced anti gen presentation. Once peptides are generated from the proteasome, ta pasin interacts with the transport protein TAP which translocates them from the cytoplasm into the ER. Peptides transported to the ER are of 8 -16 aa leng th and therefore may require additional trimming in the ER before they can bind to MHC class I molecules. This is executed by ER aminopeptidases associated with anti gen processing. When peptides bind to MHC class I molecules, the chapero nes are released and peptide- MHC class I complexes leave the ER for presentation at the cell surface. In some cases, it happens that peptides fail to associate w ith MHC class I, so they have to be transported back to the cytosol for degradation. After presentation to the cell surface, MHC class I complexes may dissociate and the heavy chain can be internalised. Once MHC class I m olecules are internalised into the endosome, they enter the MHC Class II presentat ion pathway. Some of the MHC class I molecules can be recycled and present endos omal peptides as a part of the cross-presentation process. 31 There are two major pathways of antigen processing during cross-presentation, the first one is TAP- and proteasome-dependent, the sec ond one is TAP- and proteasome-independent. In the endocytic pathway. The vacuo lar route of MHC class I cross- presentation is considered to be less effective tha n proteasome-dependent cross- presentation (Sigal and Rock 2000, Compeer, Flinsen berg et al. 2012).The TAP and proteasome- dependent cross-presentation includes t ransport of exogenous antigen from the endocytic pathway to the cytosol. DCs expo rt the antigenic material very efficiently from the endocytic vesicles to the cyto sol. Other cell subsets involved in cross-presentation are macrophages, endothelial cel ls, T cells, mast cells, and B cells, usually elicited by inflammatory conditions (Adiko, Babdor et al. 2015) . Once the complex peptide and MHC class I molecule is on the surface of the APCs, it interacts with the T cell receptor on the CD8+ T cell surface. Additionally, the CD8 molecule itself interacts with the MHC class I mole cule, resulting in a very specific binding. However, in order to fully activate the T cell and consequently induce an epitope specific response, further interactions are needed: the interaction between the costimulatory molecules CD80/86 on the APC and CD28 on the surface of the T cell, and eventually the production of cytokines by the APCs. Conversely to peptides binding to MHC class I molec ules, those that bind MHC class II are usually derived from extracellular proteins, including soluble antigens, antibody- or complement-coated immune complexes, or even cell ular debris from dying cells. Such exogenous proteins are taken up by APCs and tr ansported into the endosomal- lysosomal compartment. Before encountering the pept ides, MHC class II molecules are assembled in the ER and stabilised by invariant chain (Ii). The complex of MHC class II and Ii is transported through the Golgi in to a compartment named as MHC class II compartment, where an acidic pH activates proteases cathepsin S and cathepsin L resulting in the digestion of Ii, leavi ng a residual class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP) in the peptide-binding groove of the MHC class II. Finally the CLIP is exchanged for the antigenic peptide degraded in the endosomal pathway. MHC class II molecules loaded with foreign peptide are then t ransported to the cell membrane to present the antigen to CD4+ T cells. Thereafter, th e process of antigen presentation by of MHC class II molecules follows a similar patt ern as for MHC class I presentation, with interaction of TCR, CD4 and furt her costimulatory signals. 32 Understanding the processes of antigen processing a nd presentation can provide important insights for novel and more effective vac cine design and therapeutic strategies harnessing T-cell responses. Figure 7. Different antigen-processing pathways for the MHC c lass I and class II molecules. A MHC class I antigen presentation of endogenous ant igens. B MHC class II antigen presentation of exogenous antigens, and C MHC class I cross presentation of exogenous antigens, modified from (Heath and Carbon e 2001). 3.1.2 Viral strategies to escape host immunity Viruses are obligate parasites, needing host cells for survival. To replicate into the host cell, without being detected and eliminated by the immune system, viruses have developed strategies to evade the immune control an d even exploit host proteins for their own life cycle targeting several mechanisms i nvolving both innate and adaptive immunity. Different mechanisms of subverting the i nnate immune response have been described: 33 First, as pathogens are recognized by host PRRs in APCs through viral PAMPs, one strategy is to making inaccessible the viral genome by capping it, this is how coronaviruses and Dengue virus subvert RIG-I recogn ition of their viral RNA. Second, viruses can interfere with innate signal tr ansduction in order to prevent inflammatory cytokines and INF production. For exam ple HCV protease NS3/ cleaves an adaptor protein, MAVS, wnstream signaling, and NS4B targets STING (Coccia and Battistini 2015). Third, APCs can also be targeted through their chem okines receptors, essential to migrate in response of chemokine gradients. HIV gp- 120 VP3 loop binds to the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and allows viral entry in DC migration by downregulating CCR6 and CCR7 expression on the cell surface by inducing cytoskeleton modifications (Cirone, Conte et al. 20 12). Fourth, viruses can modulate cytokine and chemokine production. An example is the induction of IL-10 by viruses such as HIV and HCV. The effect is impairment in DC maturation and T cell response, leading to viral pe rsistence. Many viruses escape from immune control by targetin g and inhibiting peculiar mechanisms inside the cells of the innate immune sy stem, that are essential for the activation of an adaptive immune response, i.e. ant igen processing and presentation pathway (Klenerman and Hill 2005, Hansen and Bouvie r 2009, Boss and Renne 2010, Noriega, Redmann et al. 2012). Antigen presen tation includes different steps that can be targeted by viruses (Figure 8). Inhibition of the proteasomal processing is mediated by EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), becau se its sequence contains repeated motifs of glycine and alanine, which preve nt the protein to be degraded. Similarly, aa sequence of KHSV latency associated n uclear antigen 1 (LANA1) has a sequence rich in glutamine, glutamic acid and aspar tic residues which prevents as well its proteasomal degradation (Bennett, May et a l. 2005). Another important mechanism in antigen presentation is the transport of the peptide across the ER, mediated by the TAP complex and requ iring ATP. This step is targeted by a cytoplasmic membrane associa ted protein, binding TAP on 34 the cytoplasmic side, inhibiting peptide binding an d translocation. The domain mediating the inhibitory effect is at the N-termina l fragment consisting of 32 residues (Beinert, Neumann et al. 1997, Galocha, Hill et al. 1997, Aisenbrey, Sizun et al. 2006). Differently, US6 binds to TAP at its ER lume n side, while BNLF2a prevents binding of peptide and ATP to TAP. HCMV US3 directly binds to and inhibits tapasin, es sential for the expression of stable MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, c ausing MHC class I molecules to be retained in the ER. At the same level, Adenoviru s E3-19K inhibits the formation of the TAP-tapasin complex, impairing its inclusion in the PLC (Cox, Bennink et al. 1991). Interference with MHC antigen presentation c an occur also by inducing degradation of MHC molecules, this is the case of H CMV US2 and US11, which target MHC class I molecules for ER-associated degr adation(van der Wal, Kikkert et al. induce and degra dation of MHC molecules, and downregulate the expression of other cell surfa ce receptors, such as IFN- receptors, and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequ ence A and B (MICA and B), ligands for the NK activating receptors NKG2D, lead ing to minor control by NK cells (Thomas, Boname et al. 2008). HIV-1 protein nef dow nregulates the expression of MHC class I and II molecules, and CD4, optimizing v iral particle production (Barouch, Faquin et al. 2002). Adaptive immunity can be targeted also interfering with T cell activation on costimulator signals, for example KHSV kk5 can down regulate CD86 expression on B cells by inducing their endocytosis and consequen t degradation, thereby impairing the ability to activate T cells. Interfering with T cell response is another clever mechanism of immune evasion. Viruses such as RSV in fluence the polarization of CD4+T cells from Th1 phenotype, able induce Treg response against latently expressed pep tides, maintaining viral persistence. In particular Tregs increase in the pe ripheral blood of EBV positive patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and suppress the proliferation of autologous CD4+CD25- T cells (Lau, Cheng et al. 2007). During viral latency only a minimal set of genes is expressed, including micro RNA (miRNA), which contribute to immune evasion, targe ting viral antigens, which could 35 be recognized by the immune system. This is the cas e for Simian virus 40 (SV40) that can express miRNA targeting and therefore repr essing the expression of the early protein Large T antigen, which usually elicit s strong T cell responses (Sullivan, Grundhoff et al. 2005) . In BKPyVand JCPyV the earl y region encodes a pre-miRNA that generates two functional miRNAs complementary and posttranscriptionally down-regulate LTag . The 3'miRNA was found to target the mRNA of the cellular stress induced liga nd ULBP3, ligand for NKG2D a recognition receptor for detection of infected cell s, which in NK cells triggers cytotoxicity (Bauman, Nachmani et al. 2011) . Investigating on all mechanisms of viral immune esc ape is a very important tool to clarify many immunological pathways, and also neces sary to understand how to design vaccines able to prime and boost an efficien t immune response, and prevent viral related diseases. Figure 8: Antigen processing and presentation of peptide:MHC class I and interference by viral proteins modified from (Hansen and Bouvier 2009) 36 3.1.3 Vaccines The first vaccine used in humans, live vaccinia vir us, was developed by Jenner more than 200 years ago for the control of smallpox. Thr ough the centuries, vaccines have been developed and extensively used in order to ind uce protective immune responses against a specific pathogen. Jenner vacci nation strategy for smallpox consisted in injecting in human an analog non-human specific pathogen. Another strategy has been to use killed organisms, and subs equently obtain inactivated viral components, as in 1885 Louis Pasteur did for rabie vaccine, growing the virus in rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the infect ed tissues . Currently, more than 50 different vaccines are lice nsed by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, and they are e ither live, inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic,(http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVacc ines/Vaccines/ApprovedProduct s/ucm093833.htm), 14 are directed against viral pat hogens. Live attenuated vaccines could be produced against measles, mumps, and chickenpox, the advantage of this kind of vaccines is that they are the most similar to a natural infection, as a disadvantage it exists th e possibility that an attenuated microbe could revert to a virulent form and cause d isease. Such inconvenience can be overcome with the nonliving vaccines, which incl ude Poliovirus vaccine. Nonliving vaccines are in principle prepared growing viruses in continuous cell lines cultures, then the virus is inactivated by chemicals or disru pted with detergents allowing immunization with little or no risk of infection. H owever some infectious contaminants can remain, that was the case of Poliovirus vaccine contaminated with SV40 virus. Recombinant DNA technology has helped to produce la rge quantities of purified protective viral antigens for use in immunoprophyla xis without risk of infection or contamination. With such technique it is possible t o express viral proteins in eukaryotic cells of yeast, insect, or mammalian ori gin. An example of recombinant vaccine is the HBV one, produced by expressing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in yeast cells. The HBsAg assembles into vi rus-like particles (VLPs), which are highly immunogenic, resulting a very efficient vaccine. Another example are the HPV vaccines based on VLPs derived from HPV-6, -11, -16, and/or -18 subtypes. These vaccines display the L1 recombinant proteins of each subtype, expressed either in yeast or in an insect-cell system. The L1 is the major capsid protein and its in vitro expression leads to the assembly of VLPs. Vaccine s based on recombinant 37 proteins show several advantages in terms of safety and production costs, with the disadvantage of weak or poor immunogenicity when ad ministered alone, requiring the use of adjuvants to elicit a more protective an d long-lasting immune response. An alternative and more focused approach to immuniz ation involve the production of synthetic peptides representing immunodominant doma ins or even single epitopes of viral antigens, that could elicit humoral, cellular , or both immune responses, according to the specific pathogen, in fact protect ion against extracellular organisms is provided mainly by antibodies, whereas for the c ontrol of intracellular organisms, an effective CTL response is also essential. It is well known that during a natural infection, proteasomal degradation and processing o f pathogen-derived proteins occur, and epitopes will be presented at the surfac e of APCs, but not all pathogen- derived proteins and epitopes will induce an effect ive immune response against the pathogen, indeed some epitopes can induce tolerogen ic responses or induce inflammatory response without effective protection (Gibson, Nikolic et al. 2015). For this reason, it is of importance to choose appropri ate antigens and epitopes able to induce an effective immune response. It is also imp ortant that vaccines should be effective in the majority of the population exposed to the pathogen, therefore epitopes able to induce an effective response in br oad range of MHC alleles, or at least in the most frequent ones, need to be conside red. Such considerations lead to the idea that a vaccine should contain pathogen-derived peptides, which can generate an appropriate, all li fe long lasting, protective immune response in the vast majority of population, theref ore an epitope mapping of pathogen derived immunogenic proteins should be per formed. Numerous approaches have been developed to identify peptides derived from pathogens proteins that can be recognized by B and T cells, b oth experimental and predictive (Zhao, Zhang et al. 2013). Among experimental methods to identify B cell epito pes, one of the most frequently used techniques is the fusion phage display technol ogy (Smith 1985). It consists in cloning the coat protein gene region into a phage, allowing the candidate peptides to be expressed at the phage surface and then screened with sera samples or specific antibodies. Phages with positive binding are analyz ed to determine the specific peptides sequences. By phage display technology and by an affinity selection technique called Biopanning, it is possible to prod uce linear peptides mimicking the 38 structure of an epitope (mimotopes) and able to ind uce the antibody response similar to the one elicited by the epitope . Experimental method to map T cell epitopes have bee n developed, which utilize several different approaches, such as starting from identification of peptides binding to HLA molecules on solid-phase, to functional assa ys based on the identification of peptides able to elicitate in vitro an epitope-specific T cell response. The most used techniques are enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) a ssay, allowing to identify T cells producing cytokines in response to an antigen ic stimulation, intracytoplasmatic cytokine staining (ICS) and HLA multimers to be use d in flow cytometry, lymphoproliferation, and killing assays such as 51 Chromium release assays. Such methods should be used in combination to identify H LA specific immunodominant peptides, as some of these can identify functionall y immunogenic peptides but only others, such as HLA multimer staining, can identify HLA restricted immune responses. Predictive approaches are based on algorithm-based software and databases: from the sequences of peptides or even of a whole protei n they can predict which epitopes will bind to a specific HLA allele.(e.g. SYFPEITHI, BIMAS)(Schuler, Nastke et al. 2007), others, such as Immune Epitope Database (Vit a, Zarebski et al. 2010) offer the user tools to identify T cell epitopes, not onl y based on HLA-peptide binding, but also on antigen processing and presentation paramet ers, such as proteasomal cleavage and TAP transport. It can occur that bioinformatics databases find put ative peptide candidates which are virtually able to bind HLA molecules, which may rev eal not being immunogenic in vitro and in vivo , therefore they need to be coupled with experiment al approaches. Once epitopes capable of inducing protective immune responses to the chosen antigen are identified, further considerations need to be done in order to develop a peptide-based vaccine and improve its immunogenicit y: Using short peptides, which do not require process ing, may not always help to obtain a protective long lasting T cell response ; it has been demonstrated that vaccination with long peptides, which are take n up by APCs, processed and presented could induce a more sustained CTL res ponse when compared to short peptide vaccination. Moreover longer pepti des can contain CD4+ T cell epitopes, eliciting a helper cell response, wh ich can enhance also the CTL response (Kenter, Welters et al. 2008, Welters, Kenter et al. 2008, 39 Kenter, Welters et al. 2009). Improving CD8+ T cell response can be achieved by adding a synthetic non-natural pan HLA- DR binding epitope peptide (PADRE), which elicits CD4+ T cell response s and consequently enhances CD8+ T cells epitope specific responses (C ong, Mui et al. 2012). The inclusion of B epitopes would give a more compl ete T cell response, and in case of extracellular pathogen would be required . Peptide-based vaccines, as also recombinant vaccin es, are poorly immunogenic in vivo, therefore they require adjuvants, with properties o f immunostimulants and/or vehicles of the antigen. Adjuvants defined as immunostimulants act on the im mune system enhancing the immune responses to antigens. In particular, they c an influence cytokine production by activating MHC molecules, costimulatory molecule s, or through related intracellular signaling pathways. They comprise TLR ligands as the monophosphoryl A CpG DNA, acti ng on acting as vehicles, such as emulsions, liposomes, virosome s, or virus like particles (VLPs), target vaccine antigens to the immune system in a m ore efficient way and control the depot and release of antigens to enhance the specif ic immune response. Emulsions, including Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvant s, Montanide/ISA-51 containing and and the saponin extract QS-21) create a depot at the injection site, enhanc ing antigen uptake by prolonged exposure of antigen to the APC. The release of anti gen needs to be at low-level, so it can induce a potent immune response, in fact it is known that when a given antigen is used over a wide range of concentrations, interm ediate doses induce immunity, and low and high doses induce tolerance. Peptides can be carried also by liposomes, phosphol ipid bilayer structures forming small vesicles. protect t he immunogenic peptide from enzymatic degradation, are easily altered to obtain optimum presentation of the antigen, and can be efficiently taken up by APCs du e to their particulate nature, however their limitation is a low entrapment effici ency, which could be overcome by conjugating the peptide to the lipids forming the v esicle (Nagata, Toyota et al. 2007). Virosomes, differently from liposomes, have integra ted in the the influenza surface antigens neuraminidase and hemagg lutinin, this feature enhances HLA class I and II presentation and induces an anti gen-specific adaptive immune response. 40 VLPs are constituted by recombinant viral structura l proteins that are self-assembled to mimic the conformation of viruses. They have th e ideal size (20-100 nm in diameter) to be efficiently taken up APCs, and are able to also stimulated an efficient CTL response because recombinant VLP may gain acces s to the cytosol, internalization via endogenous processing pathways, thus activating antigen cross-presentation. VLP vaccines for HPV (Ga rdasil\u00ae and Cervarix\u00ae) are commercially available. ISCOMs are immunostimulatory complexes including an tigen, cholesterol, phospholipid and saponin. They favour the endosomal and cytosolic pathways for antigen presentation. Also polymers can be used for the delivery of vaccines, as the synthetic polylactides, polyglicolic acid, or the n atural chitosan. Currently in the U.S. some vaccines contain adjuvan ts, it is the case for vaccines that prevent hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphtheria-tetanu s-pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, HPV, luminium salts, whereas the HPV vaccine Cervarix\u00ae is carried by VLPs and added with MPL-A. In summary, virus-host interactions are very comple x, viruses have developed mechanisms to replicate and expand within the host, and in parallel the host has built response mechanisms aiming at clearing the virus fr om the host cell. Such processes include the recognition of the pathogen, its elimination and the elimination of infected cells through the mediators of the immu ne system. To counteract the host, viruses target the most important checkpoints in the immune response, and exploit the cellular machinery to evade immunity. K nowledge on the most important issues in virus-host interaction can help and guide the design and development of appropriate tools to monitor, prevent and /or treat virus associated diseases. 41 3.2 Polyomaviruses 3.2.1 General information Polyomaviruses belong to the Polyomaviridae family, constituted by at least 26 different members, with a broad range of infected h ost species, including human, monkey, bovines, rabbit, hamster, rat, mouse, and b irds species, and recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses prom pted revisions on its taxonomy based on host range, genetic repertoire, and DNA se quence identity (Johne, Buck et al. 2011) (Figure 9). From the single genus Polyomavirus, the Polyomaviridae family has been splitted into three genera: Avipolyomavirus: this genus is constituted by avia n polyomaviruses, characterized by high pathogenicity, and a consensu s sequence in the DNA binding domain of the LTag different to the other genera. Some of the avian polyomaviruses have an additional open reading fram e (ORF) encoding for a late protein, VP4. Wukipolyomavirus: this genus includes the WU (KIPyV), human polyomavirus 6 7 (HPyV7). These viruses share greater DNA homology than with the other mammalian polyomaviruses, especially concerning the late regi on. Orthopolyomavirus: all remaining mammalian polyoma viruses are included in the last genus, as also the human BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV), JC (SV40). 42 9: Phylogenetic tree of Polyomaviridae family, adapted from (Johne, Buck et al. 2011). All polyomaviruses share common key features: An icosahedral non-enveloped capsid constituted 72 capsomers A double-stranded DNA, of a size of approximately 5 kbp. A non-coding control region (NCCR) harboring the or igin of replication (ORI). Transcription starting from one side of the ORI res ults in the encoding of early non-structural proteins, named tumor (T) antigens. The early viral gene region (EVGR) is transcribed i nto one major transcript, from which the encoded large T antigen (LTag) and t he small T antigen (sTag) are generated by alternative splicing, while murine PyV (MPyV) and hamster PyVs also encode a third viral early protei n called middle T antigen. In the EVGR of a subset of human and complementary to LTag sequence. In BKPyV and JCPyV it has been shown to bind the cellular stress induced ligand ULBP3, i nvolved in NK cell mediated lysis (Bauman, Nachmani et al. 2011). 43 From the opposite side of the ORI, transcription of late viral gene region (LVGR) generates the encoded structural proteins VP 1, VP2 and VP3, whereby VP1 being the most abundant component of VL Ps. Of note, only the LVGR of BKPyV, JCPyV, and SV40 encode also a small non-structural protein called agnoprotein upstream of the VP1 ORF. 3.2.2 Human Polyomaviruses Human polyomaviruses (HPyV) belong either to the genera, in particular WUPyV, KIPyV, HPyV6 and and New polyo mavirus (NJPyV-2013) all belong to the genus Orthopolyomavirus (Table 1). The first two HPyV to be isolated were JCPyV and BK PyV, named after the initials of the patients from whom they were first isolated. JC PyV was isolated from the diseased brain tissue of a patient with PML, while BKPyV was isolated in cytophatically altered urinary epithelial cells she d by a kidney transplant recipient (KTR) (Gardner, Field et al. 1971, Padgett, Rogers et al. 1977). More than 35 years later, from 2007, other HPyV have been discovered n ot by isolation, but using different molecular identification techniques. 44 Table 1: Human Polyomaviruses Name Year of discovery First source of isolation Reference BKPyV 1971 Urinary epithelial cells from KTR (Gardner, Field et al. 1971) JCPyV 1971 Brain tissue (Padgett, Walker et al. 1971) KIPyV 2007 Airways samples from patients with respiratory disease (Allander, Andreasson et al. 2007) WUPyV 2007 Airways samples from patients with respiratory disease (Gaynor, Nissen et al. 2007) MCPyV 2008 Merkel cell carcinoma (Gaynor, Nissen et al. 2007, Feng, Shuda et al. 2008) HPyV6 2010 Skin of healthy subject (Schowalter, Pas trana et al. 2010) HPyV7 2010 Skin of healthy subject (Schowalter, Pas trana et al. 2010) TSPyV 2010 Skin of Trychodysplasia spinulosa patient (van der Meijden, Janssens et 2011 Serum sample (Buck, Phan et al. 2012) STLPyV 2013 Stool samples from diarrhea affected children (Lim, Reyes et al. 2013) HPyV12 2013 Liver tissue (Korup, Rietscher et al. 2013) NJPyV-2013 2014 Muscle biopsy of a pancreatic transplant recipient (Mishra, Pereira et al. 2014) KIPyVV and WUPyV were identified in airways sample s from patients with respiratory disease at the Karolinska Institute and at the Washington University, respectively (Allander, Andreasson et al. 2007, Gay nor, Nissen et al. 2007) . MCPyV was identified in 2008 in Merkel cell carcin omas (MCC), which is an aggressive form of cutaneous cancer (Feng, Shuda et al. 2008). In MCC cells infected by MCPyV, mutations, insertions, and delet ions within LTag result in the expression of truncated LTag before the helicase do main (Duncavage et al., 2009) and a 57 kb T antigen production. TSPyV was identified as etiological agent of Trych odysplasia spinulosa, skin disease of severely immunocompromised hosts (van de r Meijden, Janssens et al. 2010). HPyV6 and HPyV7 were first identified in skin swab s of healthy individuals, while HPyV9 was first identified in serum of a KTR (Schow alter, Pastrana et al. 2010). 45 HPyV10 was found in 2012 in condylomas of a patien t affected by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexi s syndrome (Buck, Phan et al. 2012) . MWPyV was found in a feaces sample of a healthy ch ild from Malawi (Siebrasse, Reyes et al. 2012), then MXPyV was identified in st ool samples from children with diarrhea in the US (Yu, Greninger et al. 2012) . As MWPyV and MXPyV show DNA identity of more than 95% with the previously d iscovered HPyV10, they can be considered as variants of HPyV10. STLPyV was identified most recently in stool sampl es of children HPyV12 in organs of the gastrointestinal tract of patients affected by malignant diseases (Korup, Rietscher et al. 2013) . HPyV13, the latest member of the HPyV, is also cal led NJPyV-2013 and has been identified in a muscle biopsy of a pancreatic transplant recipient (Mishra, Pereira et al. 2014). HPyV are ubiquitous viruses, infecting a large prop ortion of the human population. Seroprevalence for most of them have been described (Dalianis and Hirsch 2013) showing different age-dependent patterns, suggestin g that HPyV are transmitted independently of one another. HPyV infect their host without causing any apparent primary disease, but they usually persist latent without causing clinical sym ptoms, however in case of immunosuppression, they can cause severe diseases. So far, a causative role in human diseases has been demonstrated for JCPyV, BKPyV, MCPyV, and TSPyV. JCPyV is of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immun ocompromised individuals, also related to the immune reconstitution inflammatory s yndrome, moreover it is also associated to meningitis, granule cell neuronopathy , and rarely to nephropathy in BKPyV can cause nephropathy in KTRs, hemorrha encep halitis, pneumonia, vasculopathy, bladder cancer, and it might play a role in prostat e cancer. MCPyV is recognized as cause of Merkel Cell Carcinoma, while TSPyV is the cause of Trychodysplasia spinulosa. Other HPyV have been found in samples of patients, as HPyV7 was found in samples of lung transplant, but their role in causing diseases has not been fully elucidated. 46 3.2.3 BK Polyomavirus (BKPyV) 3.2.3.1 Viral all PyV, is a non-enveloped, double stran ded DNA virus. The ichosaedral virion is about 45 nm in diameter and the capsid co nsists of 72 capsomers, each composed of 5 molecules of the structural protein V P1 linked to one molecule of VP2 or VP3. The C-terminus of VP1 protein interacts wit the capsid. BKPyV virion encapsida tes the genome, which is organized in a circular DNA molecule (about 5 kbp l ength) packed around the cellular histones H2A, and H4, forming a minichromo some. The genome, containing about 20 nucleosomes, is organized in th ree distinct functional regions typical of all PyV: the NCCR, the early viral gene region (EVGR) and the late viral gene region (LVGR) (Imperiale 2007) (Figure 10). The NCCR contains the ORI, TATA- and TATA-like sequ ences for both early and late viral gene transcription, many DNA- and transc ription-binding sites, promoter and enhancer elements as well as binding sites for the LTag, and directs the early and late transcription of replication. NCCR is divi ded in blocks Fig 10: Genome organization of BKPyV 47 Based on the DNA sequence of the NCCR, BKPyV can be defined as archetype strain, most frequently found in urine of both heal thy and diseased people. In immunocompromised patients with high-level BKPyV re plication such as nephropathy in renal transplant recipients, the NCC R may have deletions, insertions or duplication of the blocks, leading to rearranged NCCR (Randhawa, Zygmunt et al. 2003, Azzi, De Santis et al. 2006, Olsen, Andresen et al. 2006, Gosert, Rinaldo et al. 2008). Rearranged variants are most often detected in sera and urine of patients with BKPyV associated diseases. These NCCR rearrangement s have been shown to increase EVGR expression and replicative capacity ( Gosert, Rinaldo et Bethge, Hachemi al. 2015). The BKPyV EVGR is on the proximal side of the ORI a nd encodes for the regulatory proteins LTag (80.5 kDa), and the tr (truncTag, 17 kDa), expressed by alternative In BKPyVand JCPyV EVGR encodes a pre-miRNA generates and posttrans criptionally down-regulate LTag expression. The 3'miRNA was found to target th e mRNA of the cellular stress induced ligand ULBP3 (Bauman, Nachmani et al. 2011) , recognized by the natural killer receptor NKG2D, thus possibly mediating evas ion from NK cell mediated elimination. LTag is multifunctional regulatory protein of 695 a mino acid lengths. It can bind a wide variety of cellular proteins, its structure in cludes different functional domains that are critical for viral replication, and may be involved also in cell transformation (Figure 11A). At the N-terminus there is the J domain, which is a heat-shock-protein- 70 (Hsp70) binding domain. Hsp70 is usually activat ed upon cellular stress, and plays a role in folding and unfolding of proteins. Interaction between the J domain and Hsp70 results in stimulation of the ATPase acti vity of Hsp70. It has been demonstrated in SV40, that upon recruitment of Hsp7 0, complexes involving the retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins p107 and p130 a re disrupted. As result the host cell enters the S phase and proliferates. (Sullivan and Pipas 2002, Sullivan, Baker et al. 2004). Next to the J domain of LTag, there is t he Rb binding domain, with a conserved LxCxE motif, which acts together with the J domain in preventing pRb interaction with cellular E2F, which would have res ulted in activation of transcription of genes involved in DNA replication activities and cell cycle regulatory activities, in particular the transition from G1 phase to S phase( Harris, Christensen et al. 1998). 48 The ORI-binding domain (OBD) of the LTag is located close to the helicase domain, which are binding to the ORi-sequence of the PyV ge nome and promote the unwinding of the circular viral DNA for DNA replica tion. For these processes hydrolysis of ATP is required, and a sequence insid e the helicase domain has an ATPase activity. The ATPase domain has a highly con served sequence among PyV, therefore such sequence has been investigated as a target in the search of anti- polyomavirus compounds (Seguin, Ireland et al. 2012 , Topalis, Andrei et al. 2013). At the outside surface of the helicase domain, at r esidues 351-450 and 533-626, there is a domain of interaction with the tumor-sup pressor p53. LTag engaging p53 interferes with its binding to DNA and prevents hos t cell apoptosis. Therefore, LTag might play a role in oncogenic transformation (Hirs ch 2005, Dalianis and Hirsch 2012, Dalianis and Hirsch 2013, Papadimitriou, Rand hawa et al. 2016). Following the helicase domain, BKPyV LTag contains a C-terminal region that bears some homology to the SV40 C-terminal domain, which can be phosphorylated on threonine 701 and, resulting in an interference wit h the degradation of the G1-S- specific cyclin E1 and MYC, contributes to cellular growth and proliferation. A C-term host range domain has been described in BKPyV LTag. Such domain, in SV40 is critical for viral replication in the host (Pipas 1 992). Alternative splicing of LTag mRNA can lead to expre ssion of a truncated (136 aminoacids), lacking the helicase domain, but prese rving the Rb binding domain. In mice models, expression of the truncTag induced ce llular transformation in the host (Abend, Joseph et al. 2009). Among HPyV, the oncogenic properties of BKPyV, JCPy V and MCPyV have been described in vitro and in animal models (Moens, Van Ghelue et al. 200 7, Borchert, Czech-Sioli et al. 2014, Verhaegen, Mangelberger et al. 2014). For MCPyV, a clear association with cancer is described in its natural host. A particular role has been attributed to the sTag and possibly a truncated for m of LTag has been found to be peculiar in Merkel cell carcinoma tumors (Chang and Moore 2012). However, BKPyV may increase the risk of developing renal and prost ate cancer (Hirsch 2005, Dalianis and Hirsch 2012, Bulut, Ozdemir et al. 2013, Dalian is and Hirsch 2013, Papadimitriou, Randhawa et al. 2016). In a study conducted in BKPyV-positive prostate cancer patients, stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with LTag derived peptides resulted in expansion of antigen-specific T cells with suppressive properties (IL-10-secreting, expressing CD4+CD25++CD127FoxP3+), 49 leading to the maintenance of a regulatory microenv ironment, thus favoring a bad prognosis (Sais, Wyler et al. 2012). In another stu dy, Keller et al evaluated if preoperative antibody response to BKPyV LTag and VP 1 could be associated with the risk of biochemical recurrence in patients unde rgoing prostatectomy for primary prostate cancer and demonstrated that seropositivit y to BKPyV LTag significantly reduced the risk of biochemical recurrence, suggest ing serology as a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer. The sTag of BKPyV contains 172 amino acids and resu lts from an alternative splicing of the same EVGR mRNA transcript of LTag. This smal ler early regulatory protein seems to be involved in viral replication and cellu lar transformation. Its sequence includes a shared domain with LTag, that is the J d omain, and a region ranging from aa 83 to 172 containing two zinc-binding motifs for med by cysteine residues configured as CxCxxC (Cho, Morrone et al. 2007), wh ich is responsible for inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading (Mungre, et 1994, Sontag, Sontag et al. 1997, Sontag and Sontag 2006, Cho, Morrone et al. 2007) (Yuan, Veldman et al. 200 2) (Figure 11B). It has been recently shown that mutations in the second domain result in lack of binding with PP2A (Cardoso, Diaz et al. 2015). Figure 11: A LTag functional domains. B sTag functi onal domains The LVGR of BKPyV is located on the distal side of the ORI, and encodes three structural protein called agnoprotein (7.4 kDa). Th e structural proteins VP2 and VP3 derive from the same transcript, whereas VP1 and ag noprotein are translated in 50 another reading frame from partially overlapping tr anscripts. VP1 constitutes the majority of the BKPyV virion proteins, which is com posed by 72 pentameric capsomers arranged in an icosahedral structure. Ins ide the capsid, one molecule of either VP2 or VP3 is linked to each VP1 pentamer. V P1 interacts via N-terminus with other VP1 molecules within the same pentamer, while the C-terminus interacts with other pentamers stabilizing the capsid. It is belie ved that both VP2 and VP3 are important for packing JCPyV and BKPyV genomes into virions as well as for uncoating and delivery of viral genome to the host cell nucleus (Shishido-Hara, Ichinose et al. 2004, Gasparovic, Gee et al. 2006). The BKPyV agnoprotein is the least conserved protei n among mammalian PyV , and in fact, has a corresponding homologue only in JCPy V and SV40 with an aa identity of 60% (Rinaldo, Traavik et al. 1998, Gerits and Mo ens 2012). In BKPyV wild type (ww), agnoprotein is a 66 aa phosphoprotein (Rinald o, Traavik et al. 1998), where potential phosphorylation acceptor sites have been mapped to Ser-7, (Sariyer, Akan et al. 2006, Johannessen, re et al. 2008). Replacing Ser- 11 with alanin or aspartic acid leads to lower vira l propagation and less protein stability (Johannessen, Myhre et al. 2008). In JCPy V it has been shown that agnoprotein potentially can enhance virus release b y acting as a viroporin (viral protein that interacts with membranes leading to m odified cell permeability to ions or other small molecules) requirinq the basic Arg-8 an d Lys-9 for such activity(Suzuki, Orba et al. 2010). Agnoprotein is located in the cytoplasm and perinuc lear area (Rinaldo, Traavik et al. 1998), and a recent work demonstrated that agnoprot ein targets lipid droplets, requiring an amphipathic helix encoded in residues 20-42 (Unterstab, Gosert et al. 2010), however it has been shown that it is also pr esent in the plasma membranes, requiring the aa clusters in the N terminus for suc h localization (Suzuki, Orba et al. 2010). It has been shown that BKPyV agnoprotein can interact with -soluble N- ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein (Johannessen, Walquist et al. 2011), and in vitro studies demonstrated that such interaction might i nterfere with the secretory pathway (Johannessen, Walquist et al. 201 1). The secondary structure of JCPyV agnoprotein has be en studied in more detail, but because of the high homology, some of the findings are likely to also apply to the BKPyV agnoprotein. This includes an -helix constituted by hydrophobic residues in aa 17 - aa 42, and this sequence has been shown to mediate in vitro agnoprotein 51 oligomerization (Coric, Saribas et al. 2014). This sequence is also found in the BKPyV agnoprotein, but no functional proof in cells in vivo is available at this point for either viral agnoprotein. Another potential interaction partner of agnoprotei n is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The interaction with agnoprotein in hibits PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro and reduces host cell proliferation. A possible ro le in switching off viral DNA replication to allow assembly of genomes and viral capsid proteins into infectious viral particles has been suggested (Geri ts, Johannessen et al. 2015). 3.2.3.2 Viral Life Cycle BKPyV infection begins with the binding of major ca psid protein VP1 to the 2,3- linked sialic acid structures at the host cell surf ace (e.g. GD1b and GT1b gangliosides) whose function is to mediate cellular recognition and cell-to-cell interaction (Dugan, Eash et al. 2005, Low, Magnuson et al. 2006, Imperiale 2007, Dugan, Gasparovic et al. 2008). Both GD1b and GT1b are present on kidney and urinary tract cells, making them the main sites of the viral infection and replication (Low, Magnuson et al. 2006, Tsai and Inoue 2010). H owever, it has been demonstrated in an in vivo study, that a BKPyV genotype binds the host cell s urface through a ganglioside-independent pathway (Pastrana , Ray et al. 2013). Murine GM95 cells lacking gangliosides were transduced wit or GD1b, efficiently enter the cells and supplementation of gangliosides did not affect the process. (Pastrana, Ray et al. 2013). The next step of cell entry is internalization of t he virus via caveolae-mediated endocytosis (Dugan, Eash et al. 2006, Jiang, Abend et al. 2009), transport to the ER, and subsequent capsid disassembly before it can ent er into the nucleus. Once the genome enters the nucleus, the EVGR expression begi ns. LTag starts binding to members of Rb family, inducing the cell to enter th e S-phase, then upon binding with p53 LTag interferes with apoptosis. LTag binds to t he ORI and unwinds the viral DNA through its helicase activity it promotes DNA repli cation, by recruiting the host cell enzymes needed for viral replication (DNA polymeras e, alpha-primase, topoisomerase I and replication protein A). 52 After the start of viral DNA replication, LVGR expr ession dramatically increases as LTag promotes LVGR mRNA transcription from multiple genome copies (gene dosage effect). As VP1, VP2 and VP3 return from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by virtue of the nuclear localization sequences, the a ssembly of the virions with encapsidated viral DNA takes place, leading to nucl ear inclusions and enlargement, and eventual lysis of the cell (Imperiale 2007, Fan ning and Zhao 2009). The viral replication capacity is mainly dependent to the NCC R, which offers DNA binding sites to host cell transcription factors and regula tors in the promoter/enhancer. In fact, rearrangement of the NCCR results in variants that may have stronger early promoters, produce more LTag and replicate faster i n immunodeficient hosts (Gosert, Rinaldo et al. 2008). 3.3 BKPyV and clinical impact 3.3.1 Epidemiology Primary BKPyV infection occurs at young age (Knowle s, Pipkin et al. 2003), and its transmission probably involves the respiratory or o ral route (Hirsch and Steiger 2003). The virus persists in the epithelium of the renourinary tract, and it has not been clearly determined if BKPyV can remain as a la tent infection, without replication, or if it there is a persistent low-lev el viral replication. However, in the healthy blood donor population, it has been demonst rated that BKPyV can reactivate in 5% - 10% of the population, and urinary shedding has been observed at low viral loads, without clinical symptoms (Polo, Perez et al . 2004, Egli, Infanti et al. 2009, Kling, Wright et al. 2012). Moreover, a fecal shedd ing has been observed in 10% of healthy adult individuals (Vanchiere, Abudayyeh et al. 2009). As BKPyV infection is virtually ubiquitous, its ove rall seroprevalence is high, reaching rate of 90% and more in the adolescent human popula tion (Knowles, Pipkin et al. 2003, Egli, Infanti et 2009, Kean, Rao et al. 2 009, Kardas, Leboeuf et al. 2015). Interestingly, the seroprevalence of BKPyV rates de crease after the 5 th decade of life, where that of JCPyV still increases indicating diff erent exposure rates during adult life (Egli, Infanti et al. 2009, Hirsch, Kardas et al. 2013, Kardas, Leboeuf et al. 2015). Recent data confirm this observation in an independ ent population and demonstrate that cellular immune responses show a similar pat tern (Knowles, Pipkin et al. 2003, Kean, Rao et al. 2009). 53 Different BKPyV genotypes can be found among human population. The first BKPyV genotyping schema was based on an epitope region of the VP1 gene, recognizing four main genotypes I-IV (Jin, Gibson et al. 1993) which are also fully distinct serotypes (Pastrana, Brennan et al. 2012, Pastrana, Ray et al. 2013). Additional subtypes within genotype I (Ia, Ib1, Ib2, Ic) and g enotype IV (IVa, IVb, IVc) could be identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of all k nown genome-full-length isolates (Luo, Bueno et al. 2008). Genotype I is worldwide distributed, genotype IV is mainly detected in East Asia, and genotypes II and III are rarely detected (Zhong, Ra ndhawa et al. 2009). In a study conducted in Switzerland on 400 healthy individuals , the most common found genotype was I, followed by type IV. (Egli, Infanti et al. 2009) 3.3.2 BKPyV-associated diseases Prevalence and level of BKPyV replication in urine, occasionally observed in the healthy population may increase with pregnancy, and immunodeficiency status including hematopoietic stem cell and renal transpl antation (HSCT and KT). The clinical impact of BKPyV is important in immunosupp ressed transplant recipients, and the main BKPyV-related diseases can be the ethiologic al agent for other diseases, such as ureteric stenosis, encephalitis, pneumonia, vasculopathy, bladder cancer, and it might play a role in cancer. 3.3.2.1 BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis ematuria due to inflammation of the urinary bladder mucosa. In HSCT patients, such disease can be caused both by chemotherapy, and by viral infections. BKPyVHC occu rs about 50 days post- transplantation and affects up to 15% of HSCT patie nts. Diagnosis of BKPyVHC should be based on evidence of clinical cystitis, h ematuria of grade 2 or more, and high-level BKPyV replication of > 7log10 copies/mL in urine. In about two-thirds of patients with BKPyV-HC, significant BKPyV viremia h as been described, which can be used as virological marker of progression and re mission (Erard, Kim et al. 2005, Cesaro, Hirsch et al. 2009, Koskenvuo, Dumoulin et al. 2013, Cesaro, Tridello et al. 2015). 54 Hirsch and co-workers were the first to propose tha t the pathogenesis of BKPyV-HC might result from a sequence of events (Binet 2000) . Accordingly, the first phase occurs pre-transplant, during the conditioning regi men, when the use of chemotherapy especially involving cyclophosphamide, damages the uroepithelium. The regenerating uroepithelial lining in the absenc e of a functional immune effectors provides the appropriate milieu for BKPyV replicati on (Hirsch and Steiger 2003). The immunosuppressive regimen is critical by decreasing the BKPyV-specific cellular immunity, providing suitable conditions for extensi ve high-level viral replication, and leading to cytopathic denudation of the uroepitheli al mucosa. In fact, patients excreting with high urine BKPyV loads (about 10 7 BKV copies/ml) are significantly more likely to develop BKPyVHC as compared with tho se who excreted less (Azzi, Cesaro et al. 1999, Leung, Suen et al. 2001). Post- engraftment invasion of donor cells causes significant inflammation causing exten sive mucosal damage and haemorrhage characteristic of severe BKPyVHC (Binet 2000, Hirsch and Steiger 2003). This model would be compatible with the concept of immune reconstitution diseases as discussed in detail, since most cases of post-en graftment BKPyVHC occur in allogeneic HSCT with graft versus host disease (Hir sch and Steiger 2003, Hirsch 2005). In a study conducted in a cohort of pediatri c HSCT (HLA-haploidentical or HLA-matched) patients, the role of BKPyV-specific T cell of the donor in the subsequent development of BKPyVHC in the recipient has been evaluated. The results suggest that BKPyVHC may be associated to a lower virus-specific T cell immunity in the donor (Basso, Algeri et al. 2013). In the light of these data, a prolonged and clinically more prominent manifestati on of BKPyVHC in the absence of prominent BKPyV-specific T-cells could be a rele vant factor leading to more extensive denudation. The therapy for BKPyVHC is mainly supportive, consi sts of bladder irrigation to prevent clot formation, hyperhydration to increase diuresis and urosurgical intervention (Hirsch 2010). Substitution of platele ts and erythrocytes has been used as therapeutic approach, with no evident benefit. S ome studies report the use of cidofovir, a nucleoside analogue of deoxy-cytidine monophosphate, for the treatment of BKPyVHC, with controversial results since it see ms that more than cidofovir, immune suppression and immune reconstitution might play a major role in the 55 resolution of BKPyVHC (Cesaro, Hirsch et al. 2009, Cesaro, Pillon et al. 2013, Koskenvuo, Dumoulin et al. Verkauskas et al. 2015). 3.3.2.2 BKPyV-associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN) In the last 15 years, with the discovery of potent immunosuppressive drugs for the anti-rejection therapy in solid organ transplantati on, BKPyV has emerged as the most challenging infectious cause of renal allograft dys function and graft loss (Binet, Nickeleit et al. 1999, Drachenberg, Beskow et al. 1 999, Howell, Smith et al. 1999, Nickeleit, Hirsch et al. 1999, Randhawa, Finkelstei n et al. 1999, Binet 2000, Hirsch, Brennan et al. 2005). BKPyVAN was initially reporte d to cause graft loss in 10% to > 80% of cases (Binet, Nickeleit et al. 1999, Drachen berg, Beskow et al. 1999, Randhawa, Finkelstein et al. 1999, Vasudev, Harihar an et al. 2005, Acott and Hirsch 2007, Comoli and Ginevri 2012), but thanks to the i mprovements in BKPyV monitoring strategies after transplantation and pro mpt/preemptive therapeutic intervention, a positive impact on graft outcome ha s been obtained (Brennan, Agha et al. 2005, Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Schaub, Hir sch et al. 2010, Sood, Senanayake et al. 2012) as summarized in (Hirsch, Babel et al. 2014). BKPyVAN represents a complication associated to hig h-rate virus replication in the grafted kidney leading to cytopathic damage of the renal tubular epithelium in the renal allograft. Consequently, the virus spreads in to the tissue and bloodstream and inflammatory cells infiltrate the interstitium caus ing tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in the allograft with a subsequent worseni ng of graft function and eventual graft loss. However, it has been demonstrated by ma thematical modelling of viral infection that also urothelial cells are crucial in the pathogenesis of BKPyVAN; results suggest that viral replication starts in the renal tubular epithelial cells but is then carried to the urothelial cell compartment where mo re than 90% of urine BKPyV loads are generated (Funk 2008). Histopathological data confirm such results, as infected urothelial cells are detected in the bladd er of patients with PyVAN (Nickeleit, Hirsch et al. 1999). Also, in vitro results obtained in primary human urothelial cells from bladder show high permissivity to BKPyV infect ion (Li, Sharma et al. 2013). 3.3.2.2.1 Risk Factors In KTRs BKPyV replication can be caused by a post t ransplant reactivation of the virus or by transmission from the allograft donor ( Bohl, Storch et al. 2005, Schmitt, et al. 2014). BKPyV donor serostatus or acti ve replication is therefore one of the risk factors for development of BKPyV viremia i n the recipient (Bohl, Brennan et al. 2008). BKPyV replication and consequent progres sion to BKPyVAN have been correlated to several demographic and clinical para meters (Wiseman 2009, Barraclough, Isbel et al. 2011), with a limited pre dictive value. BKPyVAN development results from the interaction of multiple risk factors, where probably the immunosuppression plays a crucial role (Binet, Nickeleit et al. 1999, Hirsch 2002, Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002, Hirsch, V incenti et al. 2013, Hirsch, Yakhontova et al. 2015). Other risk factors are cor related with the patient (e.g. older age, male sex, pre-transplant BKPyV negative serost atus, HLA type) (Ramos, Drachenberg et 2002, Ginevri, De Santis et al. 2003, Bohl, Storch et al. 2005, Bohl, Brennan et al. 2008, Hirsch and Prestele 2010 , Barraclough, Isbel et al. 2011, Hirsch, Vincenti et al. 2013, Masutani, Ninomiya et al. 2013), with the donor (BKVPyV positive serostatus, high number of HLA mis matches) (Bohl, Storch et 2005, Awadallah, Duquesnoy et al. 2006, Sood, Senan ayake et NCCR rearrangements, replicative c apacity) (Randhawa, Zygmunt et Gosert, Rinaldo et al. 2008, Ramos, Dr achenberg et al. 2009, Masutani, Ninomiya et al. 2013). The use of triple immunosuppressive therapy includi ng steroids, tacrolimus, mycophenolate derivatives appears as major factor a ssociated with uncontrolled viral replication and related disease (Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002, Borni-Duval, Caillard et al. 2013, Hirsch, Vincenti et al. 2013). In particu lar the use of tacrolimus rather than cyclosporine has been associated to BKPyV replicati on (Brennan, Agha et al. 2005, Dharnidharka, Cherikh et al. 2009, Hirsch, Vincenti et al. 2013). In a prospective multicenter randomized trial for the use of tacroli mus vs cyclosporine in combination with mycophenolic acis conducted in 682 de novo kid ney transplants suggested a dynamic risk factor evolution for BKPyV viremia. In the first 3 months, no difference between the two CNI was observed, while at 6 and at 12 months, rate and load of viremia were lower in patients randomized to receiv e cyclosporine, suggesting that differences between the CNIs did not play out early after transplant, but after 6 months, when usually PyVan has already been diagnos ed. What seemed to play a role in the early onset of replication was high exp osure to steroids (Hirsch, Vincenti et al. 2013). Conversely, in a prospective study condu cted in KTRs receiving cyclosporine, or low dose tacrolimus, a lower incid ence of BKPyV viremia in the latter group has been observed (Geddes, Gunson et al. 2011 ). 57 Some studies also report that induction agents such as ATG or alemtuzumab could be associated to BKPyV infection (Dadhania, Snopkow ski et al. 2008, Theodoropoulos, Wang et al. 2013). All these result s are in agreement that the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs facilitate the in fection or the reactivation of BKPyV, and that in the context of an immunodeficien t status, the virus can replicate in an uncontrolled manner, and lead to cytophatic d amage to the graft causing nephropathy and eventually graft loss. It is known that immunosuppressive drugs exert thei r function by acting on T cell activation at different levels (Figure 12). For example cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus are also named immunophilin-binding drugs , as they can interact with immunophilins (cyclophilins and FK binding proteins -FKBPs) interefering on the last signal of T cell activation, inhibiting the product ion of cytokines as IL-2. In particular, cyclosporine engages cyclophilin, while tacrolimus and sirolimus bind other cellular protein including FKBP12. The engagement of cyclos porine and tacrolimus inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin and prevents it from activating transcription factors such as NFATc, which is responsible for act ivation of cytokine genes during the immune response. Upon binding to FKBP12, siroli mus inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and prevents it from activating the translation of mRNA- encoding proteins needed for cell division, inhibit ing T cell division activated by growth factors such as IL-2. Recently, the direct effects of immunosuppressive d rugs on the BKPyV immune effectors and on the virus replication have been an alyzed (Egli, Kohli et al. 2009, Hirsch, Yakhontova et al. 2015). In detail, effects of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus and the CNIs cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been anal yzed in in primary human renal tubular epithelial cells. Sirolimus significantly i hibited BKPyV replication at clinical concentration, and such inhibition occurred in the first 24 hours after infection, during viral early gene expression, but not during viral l ate gene expression. Conversely, tacrolimus favoured BKPyV replication. The knockdow n of its natural binding with tacrolimus, resu lted in an increase in BKPyV replication. Results demonstrated that sirolimus an d tacrolimus have opposite effects on viral replication, by acting on the same target. Conversely, cyclosporine inhibited viral replication by binding cyclophilin and inhibi ting calcineurin (Hirsch, Yakhontova et al. 2015). 58 Figure 12: Immunosppressive drugs interference mech anisms with the multiple steps of T cell activation: Signal 1, TCR complex:MHC-peptide engagement; of transcription factors for cytokines production. Egli et al investigated on the direct effects of im munosuppressive drugs on BKPyV specific T cell immunity on PBMCs of healthy indivi duals. Adding tacrolimus at clinically relevant concentrations of 3 ng/mL resul ted in inhibition of BKPyV specific T cell directed against LTag. Sirolimus did not have any inhibitory effect on T cell activation, however, adding it during BKPyV specifi c T cell expansion resulted in a decrease in BKPyV specific T cells. The results sup port the recommendation of reducing IS for treating BKPyV replication and dise ase, and that a switch to mTOR inhibitors after BKPyV specific T cell activation c ould be beneficial (Egli, Kohli et al. 2009). 3.3.2.2.2 Diagnosis and monitoring of BKPyV infecti on BKPyVAN represents a complication associated with h igh-level and extremely rapid virus replication in the kidney transplant (Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002, Hirsch and 59 Steiger 2003). Monitoring of BKPyV viruria, by urin e cytology or quantitative PCR for viral DNA, and monitoring of BK viremia by quantita tive PCR, can identify patients at high risk of developing histologically proven PyVAN (Hirsch, Brennan et al. 2005, KDIGO 2009, Hirsch and P. 2013). Genetic studies on intrapatient variants in blood and urine demonstrated that urine and plasma are se parate replication compartments, with plasma being directly linked to intragraft replication whereas more than 95% of the urine viral loads appear to be generated from replication in the urothelial cell layer of the pyelon, ureter and bla dder (Funk 2008). BKPyV reactivation can occur early after kidney tra nsplantation, and the rate of patients with viral replication increases in the fi rst 6 months and with a peak at the third month. This paradigm of BKPyV replication and disease has been first described in the Basel group (Nickeleit, Klimkait e t al. 2000, Hirsch, Mohaupt et al. 2001, Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002) and confirmed by many studies around the world (Ginevri, De Santis et al. 2003, Koukoulaki, Grispo u et al. 2009). Testing for BKPyV viruria provides a window period of 6-12 weeks before viremia and nephropathy (Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002). Vire mia detection has a positive predictive value of 30-50% for biopsy-proven PyVAN with a window period of 2-6 weeks (Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002, Hirsch and Rand hawa 2013). The diagnosis of biopsy proven PyVAN requires tissue examination, i. e. by renal allograft biopsy showing positive immunostaining with cross-reactive changes (PyVAN-A), cyt previously called interstitial neph ritis (PyVAN-B), and in late fibrosis (PyVAN-C) ( Hirsch, Brennan et al. 2005, Drachenberg and Papadimitriou 2006, KDIGO 2009, Hir sch and P. 2013). The focal nature of PyVAN and the possible overlap with other pathologies such as T cell mediated rejection can render a histological d iagnosis very difficult. In fact, 10%- 30% false-negative needle biopsy results have been estimated from a study determining BKPyV loads in urine and plasma and com paring the discordance rate between to biopsy cores (Drachenberg, Papadimitriou et al. 2004, Drachenberg, Papadimitriou et al. 2004). A similar pattern has b een suggested when the clearance of histologic BKPyVAN disease has been examined (Me nter, Mayr et al. 2013). Thus, BKPyV viremia is the most predictive assay fo r the presence of \"presumptive\" PyVAN (Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002, Hirsch and Stei ger 2003, Hirsch, Brennan et al. 60 2005), thus it is recommended by current guidelines as the best assay to guide preemptive interventions (Brennan, Agha et al. 2005 , Hirsch, Brennan et al. 2005, Drachenberg and Papadimitriou 2006, Ginevri, Azzi e t al. 2007, Saad, Bresnahan et al. 2008, KDIGO 2009, Hirsch and P. 2013). Current guidelines suggest a BKVPyV replication screening at least every 3 months durin g the first 2 years post-transplant, and then annually until the fifth year post-transpl ant. Using this strategy, at least 80- 90% patients at risk for BKPyVAN could be identifie d before significant functional impairment of the renal allograft occurs (KDIGO 200 9, Hirsch and Randhawa 2013, Hirsch, Babel et al. 2014). In association with vir al molecular monitoring, analysis of specific immune responses could become instrumental in assisting the surveillance and identification of patients at risk for developi ng BKPyVAN (Ginevri, De Santis et al. 2003). 3.3.2.2.3 Immune response to BKPyV The host immune response is crucial in limiting pri mary infection and controlling viral replication through both innate and adaptive respon se. The first line of defense, prior to increase in adaptive immune response, is mediate d by innate immunity effectors. 3.3.2.2.3.1 Innate Immunity In BKPyV infection and related diseases innate immu nity has not been deeply investigated, but some studies demonstrated the inv olvement of innate immune response effectors in the context of BKPyV infectio n and related diseases. One study by Bohl demonstrated an association betwe en lack of the HLA-C7 allele and sustained BKPyV viremia (Bohl, Storch et al. 20 05), suggesting for inhibitory and activating killer-cell immunoglo bulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the control of BKPyV infection, which has been confirme d later by Trydzenskaya (Trydzenskaya, Juerchott et al. 2013). Indeed, in s amples from KTRs diagnosed with BKPyVAN, significantly lower frequencies of the act ivating receptor KIR3DS1 has been found. The protective role of this KIR genotyp e was demonstrated previously in other viral infections. PRRs play a crucial role in triggering an efficient innate immune response. In KTRs with BKPyVAN, it has been demonstrated that TLR3 an d RIG-I were upregulated, thus probably involved in the antiviral and inflamm atory response (Ribeiro, Wornle et al. 2012), also affecting the Tumor Necrosis Factor apha (TNF alpha) and TNF receptor (TNFR) system (Ribeiro, Merkle et al. 2015 ). Indeed, it has been 61 demonstrated that BKPyV infection resulted in TNF a lpha downregulation, and that PRRs TLR3 and RIG-I could induce an increase in TNF R expression. Recognition of viruses by PRRs activate signal tran sduction cascades leading to secretion of IFN, which consequently binds to the IFN receptor expressed on the cell surface, and stimulates type I or II IFN-mediated s ignaling pathways. As a result, the STATs are phosphorylated and thus dimerize and tran slocate to the nucleus, where occurs the binding to gene promoters and activation of the transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), involved in antiviral resp onses. A recent study demonstrated that expression of BKPyV LTag induces an antiviral state by upregulation of ISGs via STAT1 activation. In parti cular the first 136 aa of the protein, mapping until the Rb binding domain, are necessary for this mechanism (Giacobbi, Gupta et al. 2015). Among the key mediators of the innate immune system are also defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides, which have been demonstr ated to be involved in anti- BKPyV innate immune response. An in vitro study showed that human defensin 5 (HD5) interacts with the virus inducing aggregation of viral particles into very large, dense masses, and therefore interfering with viral attachment to host cells (Dugan, Maginnis et al. 2008). The ability to mount an effi cient innate immune response against viruses is thought to also enable and activ ate effectors of the adaptive immune responses. Here, DCs act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, uptake, processing and presenting pathoge n-derived antigens, thus playing a crucial role in antiviral response. Impai rments or deficits in DCs could lead to an ineffective adaptive immune response. A DCs l evel deficiency has been demonstrated in KTRs with BKPyVAN, but also in pati ents evaluated before transplant, who subsequently develop post-transplan t viremia, underlying the importance of DCs and therefore of innate immunity in BKPyV infection (Womer, Huang et al. 2010). 3.3.2.2.3.2 Adaptive Immunity In the control of BKPyV replication the interplay b etween humoral and cellular immunity is very important, with a crucial role for cell-mediated immune response in the kidney transplant patient. A study conducted in healthy individuals revealed that the majority of the population has BKPyV-specific a ntibodies (Egli, Infanti et al. 2009). It has also been demonstrated the presence o f BKPyV specific antibodies with neutralizing activity in immunoglobulins preparatio ns from healthy individuals, 62 meaning that in principle antibodies could contribu te to BKPyV specific immunity (Randhawa, Pastrana et al. 2015), even if they cann ot prevent cell to cell viral spread and are not expected to eradicate established viral infection (Egli, Infanti et al. 2009). In the context of kidney transplantation many obser vations on BKPyV specific humoral immunity have been done. It has been shown that pre-transplant BKPyV seronegativity or low antibody titer correlates wit h higher risk of viral replication and consequent nephropathy (Ginevri, De Santis et al. 2 003, Smith and McDonald 2006). Furthermore, a low baseline anti-BKPyV IgG titer an d a reduced prevalence of IgA in patients with increasing viral loads suggests that pre-existing antibodies could have a protective role in BKPyV activity (Randhawa, Bohl e t al. 2008). In cohorts of patients with high rate viruria or viremia, compared to pati ents without active viral replication, the pattern of BKPyV-specific antibodies was parall el to the level and duration of viral replication (Bohl, Storch et al. 2005, Hariharan, C ohen et al. 2005, Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Leuenberger, Andresen et al. 2007, Bren nan et al. 2008, Bodaghi 2009, Schachtner, Muller et al. 2011, Schachtner, Stein e t al. 2014). However, it has also been shown that presence of BKPyV-specific antibodi es does not provide full protection from viral replication and consequent di sease. In fact even though there is a correlation between antibodies titers and viral l oad, no correlation has been observed with viral clearance (Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Bohl, Brennan et al. 2008, Bodaghi 2009). It is important to underline that BKPyV-specific an tibodies are mainly detected in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays us ing as source of antigen VLPs, which are mainly constituted by VP1 protein. Indeed, when humoral response to VP1 has been compared to humoral response to LTa g, different results has been observed. In fact, in KTR VP1 humoral response corr elated with recent viruria and viremia, whereas anti-LTag response was associated with emerging BKPyV-specific immune controI. (Leuenberger, Andresen et al. 2007, Bodaghi 2009). Furthermore, anti-agnoprotein antibodies were evaluated in healt hy individuals and KTRs and compared to anti-VP1 and-LTag antibodies frequency. In healthy individuals anti- agno IgG were observed only in 15% of to 41% and 63% of anti- LTag and anti-VP1 antibodies, respectively. In KTRs results were similar, in fact anti- agno antibodies were present in 8% of the samples, while anti-LTag and anti-VP1 antibodies were found in 63% and 80% of samples. In KTRs IgG levels were analyzed in patients, without or with low replicati on, with high active replication, and with past high replication. As expected, there was a strong increase of anti-LTag 63 antibodies from patients without replication to act ive high replication and even more in past replication. An increase was was observed a lso for anti VP1 from no replication group to high replication, but no corre lation with viral replication was observed for anti-agnoprotein antibodies (Leuenber ger, Andresen et al. 2007). Taken together, available data suggest that markers of humoral immunity are not sufficient to give full protection against BKPyV re plication, and that a distinction could be made between anti-LTag and anti-VP1 antibodies, as the first seems to have a more protective role. However, the presence an effe ctive T cell mediated response is essential in controlling viral replication. BKPyV-specific T-cell responses have been investiga ted in several studies conducted mainly in kidney transplant patients, or in other BKPyV related diseases. In healthy individuals BKPyV- specific T-cells were identified soon in early studies, and also more recently, in healthy individuals, cou ld be identified showing a rather low frequency, when compared to antigens derived fr om other viruses as HCMV or EBV (Drummond, Shah et al. 1985, Tong, Miller et al . 2005, Egli 2009, Egli, Kohli et al. 2009). BKPyV-specific T cell responses could be identified either for early and late proteins, with a predominance of CD4+ T cells (Zhou, Sharma e t al. 2007). A recent studied showed that BKPyV-specific T-cells are age-dependen t, in particular the authors observed a peak in BKPyV-specific T-cells in young individuals, suggesting that BKPyV-specific cellular immunity reflects phases of active BKPyV replication after primary infection in childhood (Schmidt, Adam et al . 2014). The control of BKPyV replication and PyVAN was associated with onset of virus-specific T cell response. In particular, Binggeli et al used overlapping 15mer p eptides covering and the VP1 in ELISpot assays (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2006) and found that in kidney transplant patients, BKPyV-specific T cell responses in patien ts with decreasing or past BKPyV viral loads were significantly higher compared to p atients with increasing or persisting viral loads (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007). However, the VP1-specific responses were generally stronger compared to the LTag responses, and more likely involved CD4+ T-cells. Conversely, the LTag-specific responses co ntained a higher percentage of CD8+ T-cells (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007). These results were confirmed in a prospective cohor t of 45 pediatric patients, as it was observed that kidney recipients during BKPyV re activation had undetectable 64 levels of virus-specific T-cell responses. Upon imm unosuppression reduction, parallel to declining viral loads in plasma and urine, the f requency of BKPyV-specific T cells increased (Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007). As sequentia l blood samples were analyzed, it was observed that T-cell responses directed to LTag emerged slightly later than the anti-VP1-specific T-cell responses and significantl y increased at viral clearance (Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007). Moreover, an early ons et of LTag-specific T-cells after transplant was demonstrated to be protective from t he risk of viruria and viremia, in a cohort of KTRs, in fact LTag specific CTL activity was analyzed in patients who did not reactivate the virus, viruric, and viremic ones . At 1 month after transplantation a higher CTL activity was observed in patients who di d not reactivate the virus, compared to the ones with viral replication through out the follow up (Comoli, Basso et al. 2009). Similarly, in another cohort of adult patients diagnosed with BKPyVAN, T-cell responses towards 20mer peptides derived fro m the LTag coincided with clearance of BKPyV viremia (Prosser, Orentas et al. 2008). Chakera et al. reported that a significantly higher BKPyV-specific T-cell r esponse was associated with cleared BKPyV viremia in kidney transplant patients compared to those patients with active replication or without evidence of reactivat ion, whereby a heterogeneous pattern of responses to the different viral antigen s was observed, depending on single patients, with no clear immunodominance of a specific viral protein, moreover the antigens with higher association to viral clear ance were VP1 and LTag (Chakera, Bennett et al. 2011). More recent studies confirmed the previous results, and investigated BKPyV T-cell immunity directed to the other viral proteins. The T-cell responses were evaluated towards early proteins (sTag, and LTag) and late pr oteins (VP1, VP2, VP3), in patients with a history of BKPyVAN and with BKPyV t ransient reactivation. Results show that responses could be identified towards all investigated antigens, with a slight predominant immunogenicity to VP3, moreover patients with a history of BKPyVAN demonstrated significantly higher frequenci es of IFN- and IL-2 producing CD4+ T cells (Mueller, Schachtner et al. 2011). How ever, the role of VP3 responses was later downplayed by the same group, when Schach tner et al showed that patients with self-limited viral reactivation devel oped BKPyV-specific T cell responses, and cleared the virus in a short time (m edian: 1 month). In patients diagnosed with BKPyVAN, virus-specific immune respo nse emerged later (median 5 months) after therapeutic interventions (Schachtner , Stein et al. 2014). Notably, immune response towards structural proteins were hi gher and appeared earlier, whearas anti sTag and LTag T cells could be observe d in parallel to viral clearance 65 (Schachtner, Muller et al. 2011, Schachtner, Stein et al. 2014). The combined data suggest a pivotal role of BKPyV-s pecific cellular immunity in the control of viral replication, and has been explored for time points before and after kidney transplantation. Patients with decreasing LT ag-specific T cells from pre- to post-transplantation are at significant higher risk of viral replication, as observed in KTRs with or without viremia (Schachtner, Stein et al. 2015). Decreasing of BKPyV specific T cells at 30 days post-transplant had a p ositive predictive value for early- onset BK viremia of 81.8% (9/11 patients) and of 90% (9/10 patients), however detectable pre-transplant BKV-specific T we re not a really reliable prognostic factor, as it gives a positive predicti ve value for early-onset BK viremia of 58.8% (10/17 patients) and sensitivity of 62.5% (10 /16 patients). Such observation confirmed all previous data, suggesting that immune response to early proteins seems to be more crucial in viral replication contr ol (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007, Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Comoli, Basso et al. 200 9). In most of these studies, BKPyV-specific T-cell imm unity has been investigated using IFN- ELISpot 2006, Binggeli, Egli et Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Prosser, Orentas et al. 2008, Chakera, Bennet t et al. 2011, Schachtner, Muller et al. 2011), which identified IFN- producing T cells in response to viral antigenic stimuli, but did not give information about subpopu lations. Ginevri et al reported data with functional 51 Chromium release assay, identifying CTL responses, which in most of cases corresponded to antigen-specific CD8+ T ce lls. In particular, they showed that cytotoxic responses occurred at viral clearanc e and were directed mainly against LTag (Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007). Using flow cytometry analysis, Binggeli et al could determine that VP1 mainly induced production of intracellular IFN- in CD4+ T whereas LTag preferentially cells (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007 ). Trydzenskaya observed that patients with rapid BKPyV clearance showed higher f requency of multifunctional IFN- /IL-2/TNF- and IL-2/TNF- CD4+ T absence of Th17 CD4+ T cells (Trydzenskaya, Sattler et al. 2011). In more recent studies approaching antigen- specific T cell analysis by multiparameter flow cyt ometry strategy, it has been possible to provide information on phenotype and fu nctionality of BKVPyV-specific T cells (Weist, Schmueck et al. 2014, Weist, Wehler e t al. 2015). They were categorized in CD4+ T helper (coexpressing CD137 an d CD154) and cytolytic T cells 66 based on expression of CD137, GranzymeB and CD4 or CD8 and endowed with IFN-/IL-2/TNF- secretion capacity. The authors show that CD4+ hel per cells have mainly an effector memory phenotype, while the cyto lytic ones were mostly terminally differentiated effectors, probably deriving from th e helper compartment (Weist, Wehler et al. 2015). Furthermore, an increased number of CD4+ PD-1+ T ce lls were observed during and after viral clearance, marker that has been associa ted to functional exhaustion and chronic viremia in other viral infections, such as CMV infection (Dirks, Egli et al. 2013). Conversely to previous studies, no significa nt role was observed for CD8+ T cells, probably because of different cell stimulati on methods, as lymphocytes were stimulated by a mixture of peptides covering the wh ole sequence of early and late proteins, while in previous studies CD8+ T cells we re shown to be stimulated mostly by LTag. Of note, only one study evaluated the poss ible role of agnoprotein in BKPyV-specific T cell immunity, and results obtaine d in healthy individuals and KTR showed that in both healthy and immunocompromised i ndividuals agnoprotein- specific T cells were barely detectable. Agnoprotei n poor immunogenicity, despite its abundant expression demonstrated in KTR biopsies, c ould suggest a role in possible viral escape mechanisms (Leuenberger, Andresen et a l. 2007). In the context of kidney transplantation, immunosup pressive therapy may affect virus-specific T cell responses, as such drugs act at diffent levels of T cell activation. Such effects have been studied in vivo and in vitro (Egli, Kohli et al. 2009, Weist, Wehler et al. 2015). Results show that BKPyV-specif ic T cells inversely correlated with tacrolimus trough levels, and sirolimus affect ed only antigen-dependent T cell expansion (Egli, Kohli et al. 2009). The same effec ts of CNIs on BKPyV-specific T cell activation could be confirmed by Weist et al ( Hirsch, Yakhontova et al. 2015, Weist, Wehler et al. 2015). Taken together, all studies focusing on BKPyV-speci fic immune response after transplant demonstrated that size, frequency, and p ossibly also subtypes of the virus-specific T-cell response is inversely correla ted with viral replication, and that monitoring viral activity and immune response may p rovide relevant information to better determine patients at risk for developing BK PyV viremia and progressing to BKPyVAN. In particular, the fact that LTag-specific T cells emerge after viral clearance, when the immune system is efficiently li miting virus replication, strongly suggests that immune responses directed to BKPyV ea rly proteins play a major 67 protective role from the development of BKPyV-assoc iated diseases, therefore it would be of help in the clinical management of KTRs during their post transplant follow up, a screening of BKPyV-specific T cell res ponses in order to identify subsets of patients at risk for developing viremia, and mo nitoring should be continued until the detection of virus-specific T cell response. 3.3.2.2.4 Therapeutic strategies 3.3.2.2.4.1 Immunosuppression reduction Studies focusing on BKPyV-specific immune response after kidney transplantation help to monitor the course of viral activity and gu ide pre-emptive interventions. The uncontrolled replication of the virus is allowed by a lack of efficient BKPyV-specific immune response, thus the current therapeutic strat egy to prevent the progression to BKPyVAN is the reduction of the immunosuppressive d rug regimen in order to restore an effective BKPyV-specific T cell response . In kidney transplant patients the standard anti-rej ection therapy consists usually in CNI, MMF, and steroids. Diverse strategies in diffe rent steps have been reported for IS reduction and/or suspension: 1. As first step, dose reduction of the CNI by 25-5 0%, then reduction of the antiproliferative drug by 50%, followed by disconti nuing the latter (Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Schaub, Hirsch et al. 2010, Almer as, Vetromile et al. 2011). 2. Reduction of the antiproliferative drug by 50% f ollowed by reducing CNI by 25-50%, followed by discontinuing the antiprolifera tive drug (Brennan, Agha et al. 2005). 3. Concurrent reduction of dosages of both CNI and mycophenolate mofetil (Sood, Senanayake et al. 2012, Knight, Gaber et al. 2013). Creatinine levels and BKPyV load are tightly monito red during and after these steps, to control the efficacy of the treatment and avoid possible episodes of acute rejection. Despite preemptive BKPyV viremia-guided multiple st eps of IS reduction, a minor quote of patients still progress to overt BKPyVAN. Similarly, in cases of proven BKPyVAN the first lin e of therapy is IS reduction. However, additional therapeutic strategies have bee n reported, but results are still controversial. 68 3.3.2.2.4.2 Antivirals Cidofovir is a nucleoside analog, licensed by The Food & Drug A dministration for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that it can inhibit viral replication in BKPyV-infected renal p roximal tubular epithelial cells (Bernhoff, Gutteberg et al. 2008). In vivo administration of cidofovir gives controversial results, since some studies report cl inical improvements (Vats, Shapiro et al. 2003, Araya, Lew et al. 2008), whereas other s report no demonstrable benefit, with additional risk of nephrotoxicity (Kuypers, Va ndooren et al. 2005, Kuypers, Bammens et al. 2009). More recently, a more potent lipid-ester derivative 1-O- hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir (CMX001) able to effec tively inhibit in vitro BKPyV replication either in human renal tubular cells and in urothelial cells (Randhawa, Farasati et al. 2006, Rinaldo, Gosert et al. 2010, Tylden, Hirsch et al. 2015). It has been used in sporadic cases of BKPyVAN resulting in stabilization of creatinine (Reisman, Habib et al. 2014, Papanicolaou, Lee et a l. 2015). Leflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug capable in activated lymphocytes. It has been shown to inhi bit BKPyV replication in vitro in renal tubular cells (Bernhoff, Tylden et al. 2010). It has been administered as a replacement for discontinued mycophenolic acid duri ng IS reduction (Halim, Al-Otaibi et al. 2014), or in addition to protocols applying at the same time a reduction in IS (Elfadawy, Flechner et al. 2013). In some smaller s tudies, this has been associated with clinical improvement (Teschner, Gerke et al. 2 009), while in other cases this remained without benefits (Krisl, Taber et al. 2012 ), and in fact additional toxicity (Faguer, Hirsch et al. 2007). However, results from randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of the drug. Fluoroquinolones have been proposed as inhibitors o f BKPyV replication via an effect on the helicase activity of LTag but the sel ectivity index results low in vitro (Sharma, Li et al. 2011). No significant improvemen t has been shown when combined to IS reduction, leflunomide, and human in traveneous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (Halim, Al-Otaibi et al. 2014). IVIG have been administered which have been shown t o contain BKPyV-neutralizing antibodies (Randhawa, Pastrana et al. 2015). Thirty patients with diagnosis of BKPyVAN and not responding to 8 weeks IS reduction, nor leflunomide treatment were infused with IVIG, viral load significantly de creased after treatment and 90% 69 cleared viremia at 1 year of follow up (Vu, Shah et al. 2015). Larger cohorts and controlled studies would be required to verify the efficacy of such treatments. 3.3.2.2.5 Novel immunotherapeutic strategies All therapeutic approaches besides immunosuppressio n reduction do not seem to highly improve graft outcome in presumptive and pro ven PyVAN, for this reason alternative strategies are needed to boost BKPyV-sp ecific immunity. 3.3.2.2.5.1 Adoptive T cell transfer It has been extensively demonstrated that regaining BKPyV-specific T-cell immunity to prevent PyVAN is essential, thus protocols of vi rus-specific adoptive T-cell therapy could be an effective approach (Comoli, Cioni et al . 2013). In an early study a method for in vitro generation of BKPyV-specific T cells has been desc ribed. PBMCs from BKVPyV seropositive healthy donors and kidney transplant patients were stimulated with dendritic cells pulsed with inactiv ated virus, in IL-12. BKPyV-specific T-cells with cytotoxic ac tivity could be obtained, with a high frequency of CD3+ /TCR + cells displaying an MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity (Comoli, Basso et al. 2003). The use of inactivated virus is not easily conducted in the context of the requirements for good medical ma nufacturing practice, which are a prerequisite for the permission to use T-cell thera pies. A recent study demonstrated the possibility of expa nding BKPyV-specific T-cells for possible use in adoptive cell transfer, by stimulat ing PBMCs from healthy donors and transplant patients with monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with overlapping peptide pools covering the whole amino acid sequenc es encoded in VP1, VP2, VP3, sTag and LTag in the presence of IL-2. CD4+ and CD8 + T cells could be obtained, which responded to restimulation to viral antigens, in particular VP1, LTag and sTag, but without a clear immunodominance. Intracellular production of IFN- TNF- and IL-2 could be observed, suggesting the contribution of both Th1 and Th2 cells (Blyth, Clancy et al. 2011). So far, no cases of BKPyV-specific adoptive T cell transfer have been published for kidney transplant patients, but there have been cli nical studies in HSCT patients (Papadopoulou, Gerdemann et al. 2014) where T cells for adoptive T cell transfer were generated from PBMCs of HSCT donors specific for HHV-6 and BKPyV (VP1 and L Tag). From 48 clinical grade T cells preparation obtained after peptidic s timulation including CD8+ and 70 CD4+ T cells, 14 had activity against all five stim ulating viruses (pentavalent), 9 recognized four viruses (tetravalent), 12 were triv alent, 11 were divalent, 1 was monovalent, and 1 failed to recognize any of the ta rgeted viruses. Only 28 of 48 were BKPyV specific. Cells were infused and resulted to be safe and effective in those patients showing viral reactivations (Papadopoulou, Gerdemann et al. 2014). There are some unique data for a young HSCT recipie nt affected by JCPyV-related PML successfully treated with JCPyV-specific T cell s obtained by stimulating PBMCs from the HSCT donor with a pool of 15mer peptides s panning the whole sequence of JCPyV VP1 and the LTag (Balduzzi, Lucchini et al. 2 011), which had been characterized earlier in the Binggeli study in kidn ey transplant patients (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007) and another study on JCPyV-specific re sponses in HIV-AIDS patients with and without PML (Khanna, Wolbers et al. 2009). This expansion method could be extended to BKPyV and might be used in clinical practice. Another promising method that could be part of the strategy aiming at obtaining antigen-specific T cells for adoptive transfer is s treptamer staining and selection. This method derives from HLA-peptide multimers technolog y, consisting of multimers of HLA molecules bound to HLA-restricted peptides and labeled to fluorophores, which target and allows the detection of HLA-matched anti gen-specific T cells. In this way, epitope-specific T cells can be identified and sort ed, but cannot be administered for adoptive T cell transfer, as markers remain on the cell surface after staining and therefore could compromise the effector function of the stained T cells. The novelty of streptamers consists in the possibility of rever ting the binding of the multimer to the cell thanks to a Strep-tag / Strep-Tactin techn ology. After the selection of epitope- specific T cells, by adding biotin, the interaction of Strep-tag with Strep-Tactin can be disrupted and purified epitope-specific T cells are free of any marker on their surface, possibly with preserved effector functions. 3.3.2.2.5.2 Epitope mapping and vaccine development In the perspective of using epitope-specific T cell s for adoptive transfer, it would be necessary to identify immunogenic, possibly immunod ominant, HLA-restricted epitopes deriving from viral proteins. For this pur pose, epitope mapping would be useful. T cell epitope mapping can be performed wit h different techniques, at different levels, predictive and experimental. Pred ictive approaches include the use of computer algorithms predicting the processing an d/or binding of aminoacidic 71 sequences to defined HLA alleles. Then, putative ep itopes can be tested experimentally with solid phase binding assays, ELI Spot assays, killing assays and also multimer staining. Identification of immunodominant epitopes would be of great interest also in the context of peptide vaccine development to prime and /or boost BKPyV-specific immunity in order to prevent BKPyV-related diseases . Different studies investigated BKPyV-specific T cell immunity identifying immunoge nic epitopes within VP1 and LTag sequences, either for HLA class I and II allel es (Table 2). Most of studies focused on the highly frequent HLA-A*02 allele, whi le it would be of interest to identify immunodominant epitopes through the majori ty of frequent alleles. In the first BKPyV report on selective epitopes by Krimskaya et al, an immunogenic epitope within VP1 sequence was identified. Candida te peptides selected by algorithm predictions were experimentally verified by 51 Chromium release assay and ICC in splenocytes obtained from humanized HLA-A*02 mice. Moreover, HLA restriction was tested in PBMCs samples obtained fr om 10 healthy individuals (HI) and 1 KTR and stimulated in vitro with VP1 peptides. By tetramer and CD107 staining they could identify an HLA-A*02 9mer epito pe starting at aa position 108 in VP1 sequence (p108), able to elicit cytotoxic T cel l response in 3/10 HI and in the KTR (Krymskaya, Sharma et al. 2005). The same group confirmed the p108 epitope and another epitope at position VP1 144 (p144) in a larger cohort of HI, and observed that such epitopes were cross-reactive wit h JCPyV (Sharma, Zhou et al. 2006). They later could determine that such epitope s were able to elicit CD4+ cytotoxic T cell responses characterized by secreti on of multiple cytokines, in particular IFN- and TNF - (Zhou, Sharma et al. 2007). VP1-derived p108 epitope was confirmed to be immun odominant also by other investigators, through computer prediction and exp erimental confirmation with 51 Chromium release assay and tetramer staining, Chen at al could identify a cytotoxic T cell response in 50% of HI samples, and identifie d another HLA-A*02 immunodominant 9mer epitope in 80% of HD (p44). In samples from PyVAN patients the response was more frequently found towards p108 than p44, suggesting a different pattern of response in patients (Chen, Tr ofe et al. 2006). Other groups reported epitopes within the LTag sequ ence. The first study identified immunodominant epitope specific for HLA-B*07 and -B*08 at N-terminus of the 72 protein, as a 15mer sequence starting at position 2 5, also containing a 9mer epitope at position 27. They could also find HLA class II 1 5mer epitopes restricted for HLA- DRB1*0901 at aa position 154, 139 and 140, and for HLA-DRB1*0301 at position 15. Such epitopes were conserved in JCPyV (Li, Melenhor st et al. 2006). Randhawa et al identified other LTag epitopes in HLA-A*02 HI an d KTR. Candidate epitopes selected by algorithm prediction were tested in vitro in ELISpot assay and 9mer epitopes at position 362 was found to elicit IFN- production in 83% of the tested HI and in 71% KTR. Epitopes at position 406 and 410 we re also frequently identified in HLA-A*02 HI and KTR (Randhawa, Popescu et al. 2006) and further confirmed by other studies (Zhou, Sharma et al. 2007, Schneidawi nd, Schmitt et al. 2010). Provenzano et al characterized in healthy donor sam ples the immune response to HLA-A*02 specific LTag 9mer epitope starting at pos ition 579, previously identified by Zhou et al. They could find that the epitope eli cited an increase in IFN- expression and secretion, moreover it could elicit CTL response by CD8+ CD45RA+ T cells (Provenzano, Bracci et al. 2006). Another study focused on other frequent HLA Class I alleles, in particular HLA-A*01, A*03, and A*24 (Ramaswami, Popescu et al. 2009). Th e authors could identify numerous immunogenic epitopes after computer predic tion, in vitro binding and ELISpot assay using PBMCs cultured in presence of a mix of overlapping peptides spanning the whole LTag sequence. A 9mer epitope at position 506 was found in 100% of HI and 67% of HLA-A*03 KTRs. Other epitopes were found with frequence (Ramaswami, Popescu et al. 2009). Unfortu nately, other tests would be required to confirm HLA restriction. Thereafter, th e same group identified a 15mer epitope able to elicit a T cell response mediated b y class II, in different HLA-DRB1 alleles. It is located in the helicase domain of LT ag, at position 313 (Ramaswami, Popescu et al. 2011). A recent study characterized the phenotype of epitope-specific T cells, in particular to VP1 p44 and p108, and LTa g p579 and p410. They observed the immunodominance of VP1 p108, a low frequency of p579 responses and none for p410. Epitope-specific T cells showed an effect or memory phenotype by FACS analysis, not proliferating. They produced IL-2, IF N-, TNF- and expressed low levels of CD107a (van Aalderen, Remmerswaal et al. 2013). All these studies suggest an immunodominance for VP1 epitope p108 in HLA-A*02 individuals, which could be confirmed by several studies and technique s, whereas this was not the case for the BKPyV LTag (Table 2) . Epitope specific T cell responses should be analyze d in KTR and correlated with the 73 status of BKPyV-related disease, to understand whic h are more associated to viral clearance or protection from viremia, and studies i nvestigating BKPyV VP1 and LTag epitopes restricted to other frequent HLA types wou ld be required in order to characterize the pattern of BKPyV immune response i n the majority of the population. Targeting several HLA types would be of great interest in the context of immunotherapy, giving the possibility of preventing and/or treating diseases in as many people as possible, either by adoptive T-cell therapy and vaccine administration. A very recent paper investigated BK PyV T-cell epitopes by next generation sequencing of the whole viral genome in samples from viremic transplant recipients. The authors found low levels of variant s in epitopes sequences, which may suggest that despite conservation, BKPyV varian ts may encode peptides that can escape the immune response and emerge in case o f selection pressure given by an eventual immunotherapy (Sahoo, Tan et al. 2015). 74 Table 2: Published BKPyV specific epitopes Reference BKVPyV protein aa start position aa sequence HLA restriction Studied population Frequency Experimental Methods (Krymskaya, Sharma et al. 2005) VP1 108 LLMWEAVTV 2006) AITEVECFL HLA-A*02 13 HI not described LTag 579 LLLIWFRPV HLA-A*02 13 HI not described (Randhawa, Popescu et al. 2006) LTag 362 Li 2006 LTag 27 LPLMRKAYLRKCK HLA-B*07, HLA -B*08 17 HI cytotoxicity assay 15 HI not de HI not de 17 HI et Randhawa, Viscidi et 27 HI 33% ELISpot 15 HI 40% 75 4 Aims With this study we sought to explore BKPyV-specific immune responses, focusing on: 1. Evaluation of BKPyV agnoprotein role in immune e scape mechanisms, as downregulation of MHC class I and II molecules. 2. Identification and characterization of immunodom inant 9mer-epitope T cell responses within BKPyV EVGR proteome Providing new insight in BKPyV immunity has the ult imate goal of applying such new knowledge to clinical practice, giving insights for novel therapeutic approaches for preventing and/or treating BKPyV associated disease s. 76 5 Results 5.1 Comparing Effects of BK Virus Agnoprotein and H erpes Simplex-1 ICP47 on MHC-I and MHC-II Expression Agnoprotein of BKPyV is abundantly expressed in the late viral life cycle, and localizes mainly to the cytoplasm and perinuclear a rea, it colocalizes with lipid droplets (Rinaldo, Traavik et al. 1998, Leuenberger , Andresen et al. 2007, Unterstab, Gosert et al. 2010). Among all HPyV, an ORF encodin g an agnoprotein has been found only for BKPyV and JCPyV, and several studies have been investigating its function, which at present still remains to be defi ned. Potential cellular interaction partners have been p roposed following a yeast-2-hybrid screening in order to come a step closer to cellula r pathways that agnoprotein might target. Thus, it has been shown that BKPyV agnoprot ein can interact with -SNAP, protein involved in the intra-cellular trafficking and fusing of vesicles in the cell membranes, leading in vitro to interference in the cell surface secretion path way (Johannessen, Walquist et al. 2011). The possible i nvolvement of agnoprotein in vesicle transport is supported by the observation t hat agnoprotein co-localizes with lipid droplets (Unterstab, Gosert et al. 2010), sin ce other proteins detected in lipid droplets have been linked to intracellular vesicle transport. (Guo, Walther et al. 2008). Agnoprotein has also been demonstrated to in teract with PCNA, leading to inhibition of PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro and consequent reduction of cell proliferation (Gerits, Johannessen et al. 2015 ). Despite abundantly expressed, also in vivo in florid biopsies of of kidney transplant patients diagnosed with PyVAN, agnoprotein seems to be immunologically ignored. Both, humoral and cellular responses have been inve stigated towards this protein, but with very low or even absent results. Moreover, differently from LTag and VP1, the rare agnoprotein-specific T cell responses did not correlate with the course of viral replication in patients (Leuenberger, Andrese n et al. 2007). The observations that agnoprotein could negatively influence vescicular transport 77 and cell proliferation, together with the absence o f antigen specific immune responses could suggest a role for agnoprotein in i mmune evasion mechanisms, maybe involving antigen processing and presentation pathways. In this context, it is of interest to note that histopathology studies rep orted a decreased HLA class II expression of BKPyV-infected renal tubular epitheli al cells compared to the levels found in biopsies showing acute cellular rejection (Nickeleit, Hirsch et al. 2000). Together, these data suggested the hypothesis that maybe a component of BKPyV genome could negatively influence HLA class II expr ession. This hypothesis is in line with some considerations regarding the virus-host interaction, that can be derived from the BKPyV and JCPyV biology and epidemiology. BKPyV and JCPyV are viruses successfu lly adapted to the human host, as evidenced by the fact, that the vast major ity of the general human population is infected, yet without any significant clinical m anifestations. However, BKPyV and JCPyV are not perfectly controlled in the human hos t, since there is evidence of asymptomatic persistent and/or intermittent replica tion in healthy individuals (Egli, Infanti et al. 2009). Indeed, signs of disease are almost exclusively found in special patient groups that are immunocompromised (Hirsch 2 005, Hirsch, Kardas et al. 2013, Hirsch, Babel et al. 2014). Persistence is pe culiar to viruses having strategies of immune evasion such as members of the Herpesviri dae, as EBV, CMV, KHSV and HSV. In BKPyV and JCPyV, a possible mechanism for i mmune evasion and down- regulation of viral gene expression has been propos ed, as a miRNA has been identified in the LVGR, capable of targeting the mR NA of the cellular stress induced ligand ULBP3, with the effect of down-regulating LT ag mRNA expression, known to induce an important cell response (Bauman, Nachman i et al. 2011). Taken together, it seems a biologically plausible hypothesis to pos tulate that BKPyV has evolved one or more mechanisms of immune escape, and that agnop rotein could play a role in such processes. Several viral proteins have been described able to down-modulate cell surface HLA molecules expression in order to hide from immune s ystem recognition. Notably, the immediate early protein ICP47 (pICP47) from HSV is small viral protein of only 88 aa, similarly small as the BKPyV agnoprotein. The pICP4 7 has been reported to downregulate HLA class I antigen presentation by sp ecifically binding to TAP, and thereby impairing the presentation of HLA-peptide c omplexes. The functional domain of HSV-pICP47 appears to map to the aa 2-35 of the N-terminus. Strikingly, the secondary structure of HSV-pICP47 is predicted to c ontain an amphipathic helix 78 structure (Galocha, Hill et al. 1997, Aisenbrey, Si zun et al. 2006). Given these similarities between HCV-pICP47 and the BKPyV agnop rotein, we hypothesized that the BKPyV agnoprotein might have a similar immunomo dulatory role in BKPyV immune evasion. Therefore, an experimental system w as set up to test this hypothesis in vitro. We investigated effects of agn oprotein expression on HLA class I and II (HLA-ABC and -DR) surface expression in tran siently and stably transfected cells. The levels of HLA class I and class II expression o f primary human renal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) were quantified by flow cy tometry in the presence or absence of agno expression. In a second approach, U TA-6 cells co-transfected with plasmids constitutively expressing agnoprotein and the enhanced green-fluorescent protein (EGFP), as well as in UTA-6 cells bearing t etracycline regulated agnoprotein. As a control, the HSV-pICP47 was transfected and it s effect on HLA expression was compared. Finally, as the ultimate goal of antigen presentation via MHC class I is the induction of CTL activity, we evaluated the influen ce of agnoprotein expression on antigen specific CTL on UTA-6 cells expressing tetr acycline regulated agnoprotein. 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 In our experimental model HLA class I and II expres sion were not affected by agnoprotein. This has been demonstrated both induci ng constitutive and tetracycline regulated agnoprotein expression, also when IFN- was added to the cells to mimick an inflammatory context and upregulation of HLA mol ecules. Conversely, as expected, pICP47 expression specifically decreased HLA class I but not II expression. Possible effects of heterogeneous expression of agn oprotein in cell cultures could be excluded as we obtained the same negative results i n UTA-6 cell clones, wich expressed agno in a tightly regulated manner. Final ly, CTL activity upon activation by viral antigen presentation was not affected by agno protein expression. None of our results could indeed demonstrate a role for agnoprotein in interfering with antigen processing and presentation pathways, and consequent CTL activity. Our hypothesis was based on previous studies in whi ch immunological ignorance towards agnoprotein was observed (Leuenberger, Andr esen et al. 2007). Agnoprotein was also demonstrated to be involved in vescicular transport to the surface, and HLA molecules loaded with peptides are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface for immun e display (Johannessen, Walquist et al. 2011). Moreover, in earlier studies PyVAN bi opsies were compared to T-cell mediated rejection biopsies in KTRs, and HLA class II was observed to be downregulated in BKPyV infected cells. In a recent study BKPyVAN biopsies were compared with T cell mediated rejection for express ion of TAP1 and HLA class I -2 -microglobulin and no difference has been observed, suggesting that BKPyV does not seem to be involved in this kind of potential i mmune evasion mechanism (Buettner, Xu et al. 2012). However, many other checkpoints in the immune syste m can be targeted by viruses, starting from interfering with viral recognition by innate immunity then impairing recruitment of immune response effectors by modulat ing production of chemokines, and also targeting adaptive responses by co-stimula tion inhibition or induction of Treg responses. For this reason, further approaches to investigate a role of agnoprotein in immune evasion need to be explored. 86 5.2 Characterization of Immunodominant BK Polyomavi rus 9mer-Epitope T-cell Responses BKPyV is an ubiquitous virus infecting up to 90% of the human population, mainly during childhood, without any clinical symptoms (Kn owles, Pipkin et al. 2003, Egli, Infanti et al. 2009, Schmidt, Adam et al. 2014). Di sease manifestations appear almost exclusively in immunosuppressed individuals, specifically in transplanted patients receiving IS therapy anti rejection, in wh ich uncontrolled high-level BKPyV viruria and viremia have been identified as markers of progression to disease (Hirsch, Knowles et al. 2002). Despite a number of antiviral therapy have been proposed, the current strategies to manage BKPyV re plication and disease is immune suppressive therapy reduction, leading to a restauration of T cell immunity (Hirsch, Brennan et al. 2005, KDIGO 2009, Hirsch an d Randhawa 2013). In fact, by reducing immunosuppression, parallel to decrease of viral replication, a significant increase of BKPyV-specific T cell immunity has been observed (Comoli, Azzi et al. 2004, Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007, Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Schachtner, Muller et al. 2011). Thus, an effective virus specific T cell res ponse seems to be crucial in the control of viral replication. In previous studies T cell responses have been inve stigated to BKPyV antigens, overlapping 15mer peptide pools encoded in the EVGR and LVGR have been used as stimulus (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2006, Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007, Ginevri, Azzi et Muller et al. 2011, Weist, Schmue ck et al. 2014), and it has been observed that responses to LVGR, and in particular to VP1, are prominent compared to EVGR and mainly characterized by CD4+ T cells pr oducing IFN- (Binggeli, Egli Binggeli, Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Weist, Schmueck et al. 2014) . The CD8+ T cell responses could be observed (Krymsk aya, Sharma et al. 2005, Binggeli, Egli et al. 2006, Provenzano, Bracci et a l. 2006, Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007, Ginevri, Azzi et al. 2007, Schachtner, Stein et al. 2015), their characterization demonstrated that they were directed mostly to th e EVGR protein LTag and that they strongly correlated with viral resolution, sug gesting a protective function. However, because most of the studies used 15mer pep tide pools to evaluate BKPyV specific responses, the distinct contribution of CD 8+T cells remained undefined. We 87 decided to better characterize BKPyV-specific CD8+ T cell responses specific for 9mer epitopes. Complementary to current research, w e focused on the BKPyV EVGR region. We interrogated the responses in serop ositive healthy individuals and attempted confirmation by independent techniques in cluding streptamers, CD107a, and cytotoxic killing assays. The results were then taken to a cohort of pediatric kidney transplant patients for an independent asses sment. 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 Supplementary Table 1: Characteristics

BKPyV viruria was defined by a urine viral load of 2500 genome equivalents (GEq)/mL, GEq/mL. Based and recovery from BKPyV viruria and viremia, PBMCs samples of to detect BKPyV IgG as described (Egli, Infanti et al. 2009, Kardas, Sa deghi et al. 2014). Each serum sample was serially diluted 1:100, 1:200 and 1:400 and the optical density (OD) was measured at 492nm. The OD 492nm values were normalized to the OD 492nm of an internal reference serum, sera OD 492nm >0.100 at the 1:200 dilution were defined as IgG positive. Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells fro m whole blood PBMCs from anticoagulated blood or from buffy coat preparations were diluted 1:2 in D-PBS w/o Ca 2+ Norway). centrifugation (room temperatu re, 800g; 25 minutes (min)), PBMCs were recovered, and washed twice i.e. resuspe nded in D-PBS w/o Ca 2+ and Mg 2, and centrifuged (RT, 300g, 10min). The cells were counted and resuspended in 117 culture medium RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% Human Chemie GmbH Buchs or cryopreserved in culture medium containing 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. In vitro expansion of T-cells Freshly isolated or thawed PBMCs were seeded at a c oncentration of 2x10 6/ml in culture medium in 24 well-plate after the number of viable cells was counted using Trypan Blue exclusion. PBMCs were stimulated with L PP or (200ng/ml), and incubated for 9-14 days 5% CO 2 before phenotypic and functional assays were carried out. Recombinant human IL-2 (20U/ml, P eprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and recombinant IL-7 (5ng/ml, Peprotech) were added once a week. PBMCs obtained from cryopreserved samples from pedi atric KTRs were first thawed and resuspended in pre-warmed culture medium. The n umber of viable cells was counted using Trypan Blue solution. The cells were resuspended at the concentration of 2x10 6/ml in culture medium, seeded in 24 well-plate and 200ng/ml 15mP and IL-7 (5ng/ml) were added at day 3, before performin g phenotypical and functional assays at day 7.

Data were considered reliable w hen Minimum release was less than 50% of Maximum Release. 121 By SYFPEITHI and IEBD epitope prediction alghoritms , in BKPyV EVGR for each of 14 HLA-A and -B types prevalent in Europe and North America, which showed to cluster across several HLA types. From these clusters, 73 predicted 9mer epito pes, including epitopes identified in previous studies, were selected. Additional 24 c andidate epitopes locating out of the clusters were also included, for a total of 97 epitopes. Corresponding peptides were synthesized and used for experimental epitope mapping, with also longer peptides corresponding to clusters where 9mer epito pes overlapped. BKPyV-specific T cells were expanded from PBMCs sam ples by stimulation with a pool of 15mer overlapping peptides spanning the who le LTag (15mP) sequence, then tested in a IFN- with the 15mP of 9mer peptides according to a checkerboard matrix approach. Positive responses were confirmed by re-challenge with single 9mer pep tides. Our current approach of cell expansion was successful and we could elicit B KPyV-specific responses. Out of 97 candidates, we could confirm 39 epitopes present in at least 30% of BKPyV healthy participants with different HLA distributio n. The overall results indicated that BKPyV EVGR-specific 9mer T cell responses were hete rogeneous in terms of frequency and strength. For some HLA types, positiv e responses were found with higher frequency and directed towards multiple epit opes; for example, or -B*51 positive more than one epitope could be identified in >50% of healthy individuals. In line with the predicted clusters, some areas app eared to be more immunogenic than others. The area including 9m383 to 9m393 was highly immunogenic in individuals with HLA-A*02, -A*11,-B*35 and -B*39, a nd also the domain from 9m119 to 9m133 appeared to be highly immunogenic in multi ple HLA types. Since ELISpot assays are functional responses, but cannot attribute the HLA- of the IFN- inducing 9mer epitopes, MHC streptamer staining ha s been performed, and we could determine HLA specificity i n 21 of 39 epitopes, with restriction for specific HLA alleles in some cases, while other epitopes could be presented by different HLA class I types, mainly be longing to the same cross reactive epitope groups, which are known to share epitopes s pecificities. Furthermore our results demonstrate that with our e xpansion protocol we could obtain in healthy individuals functional epitope-sp ecific CTL responses, as 122 demonstrated in killing assay and CD107 staining, a nd that such cells were actively proliferating, dividing approximately once every 1- 2 days. With this successful method it could be possible to confirm our results in and independent cohort of 19 pediatric KTRs who were protected or recovered from BKPyV viremia. Thirteen epitopes could be validated in these 19 KTRs, in fa ct 10 of the 9mer responses found in HI could be detected also in patients, and addit ional 3 epitopes were found independently only in KTRs, may be the result of a persistent exposure to the virus concomitant with the stronger immune responses char acterizing children (Schmidt, Adam et al. 2014). The identified epitopes could be used for monitorin g virus specific T cell responses in KTRs in combination with BKPyV replication screenin g, in order to identify patients at risk for BKPyVAN progression, and consequently guid e therapeutic interventions. As the observed epitope-specific CD8+ T cells were fun ctional and highly proliferating, the identified epitopes could be used also in the p erspective of adoptive T cell transfer or vaccine development. In the context of kidney transplantation, it has be en previously demonstrated that a risk factor for BKPyV viremia is constituted by a h igh number of HLA mismatches between the recipient and the donor, and also speci fic HLA types in the recipients (Awadallah, Randhawa et al. 2004, Bohl, Storch et a l. 2005, Awadallah, Duquesnoy et al. 2006, Masutani, Ninomiya et al. 2013), there fore we evaluated the potential association of BKPyV replication with single HLA-A and -B alleles in 118 consecutive KTRs, with 38 experienced viremia. We could observe heterogeneous distribution of viremic patients among HLA types, with a significan t lower rate of viremic patients in HLA-A*01 patients (p<0.005), furthermore single mis matches were correlated to viremia, but no clear association could be observed in any of the analyzed HLA. Unfortunately, the studied cohort could be to small to obtain significant results about HLA types and risk of infection, therefore similar analysis should be performed in larger cohort of patients. 123 6 DISCUSSION BKPyV infection can cause disease almost exclusivel y in immunodeficient patients (Hirsch and Steiger 2003, Rinaldo, Tylden et al. 20 13), while in immunocompetent individuals it can persist lifelong after primary i nfection and can be asymptomatically shed in urines (Knowles, Pipkin et al. 2003, Egli, Infanti et al. 2009, Schmidt, Adam et al. 2014). Viral persistence could be explained by an immune control operating in healthy individuals, able to prevent viral mediated damage, but not to the extent to fully eliminate the virus from the body. In this co ntext there could be the possibility of a viral component acting to subvert immune control, with mechanisms of immune evasion. Many viruses, in particular those characterized by persistence in the host, target different steps of immune system, from viral recogn ition to adaptive immune responses, in order to get advantages over the host cell. Several studies have investigated on the immune response to BKPyV trying to identify which effectors could play a major role in the control of viral rep lication and prevention of disease, identifying T cells, as critical effectors in the c ontrol of virus (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2006, Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007, Ginevri, Basso et al. 2 007, Comoli, Basso et al. 2009, Schachtner, Muller et al. 2011), therefore a possib le targeted checkpoint by BKPyV could be antigen processing and presentation, idea supported by the observation that in biopsies from KTRs with BKPyVAN diagnosis H LA-DR expression seemed lower compared to T-cell mediated rejection (Nickel eit, Hirsch et al. 2000). One of the peculiar features of BKPyV among all HPy V, shared only by JCPyV, is the expression of agnoprotein, a small viral protein of 66 aa demonstrated to be expressed in BKPyV-infected cells, also in patients diagnosed with BKPyVAN, but the only among all BKPyV proteins not able to elici t an immune response (Leuenberger, Andresen et al. 2007), suggesting a p ossible role in immune escape mechanisms, idea that could be supported by the obs ervation that agnoprotein could be involved in vesicular transport (Johannessen, Wa lquist et al. 2011), and the fact that agnoprotein shared a similar structure with a HSV protein, pICP47, known to inhibit HLA-peptide complex presentation to the AP C surface by binding TAP (Galocha, Hill et al. 1997, Aisenbrey, Sizun et al. 2006). For all these reasons, we 124 have compared the effects of agnoprotein and ICP47 on HLA class I and II expression in transfected cells expressing the two proteins constitutively or under tetracycline regulation. The results showed that BKPyV agnoprotein expressio n had no inhibitory effect on HLA class I and II expression in our in transiently transfected cells, even by simulating an inflammatory milieu, obtained by addi ng IFN-\u0001 with a consequent upregulation of HLA expression. Conversely, ICP47 s pecifically downmodulated HLA class I on the cell surface, whereas no inhibition was observed, as expected, on class II expression. Our results obtained in trans iently transfected cells can have some limitations, in terms of efficiency of transfe ction and durability of protein expression, to overcome this problem, we created st able clones expressing agnoprotein or ICP47 under the tight control of tet racycline, confirming the previous results, thus we could more robustly demonstrated t hat agnoprotein did not interfere with the quantity of HLA molecules on the cell surf ace. To exclude the involvement of agnoprotein on CTL fu nction upon peptide presentation and consequent T cell activation, we e valuated if agnoprotein expression could interfere with antigen specific CT L activity using as antigen a well- characterized, immunodominant HLA-A*02 restricted 9 -mer peptide from the CMV- pp65 antigen, but no impairment in killing activity could be observed when agnoprotein was expressed . From all our results we can conclude that agnoprote in does not seem involved in antigen processing and presentation pathway as it c ould have been hypothesized by previous studies results demonstrating its low immu nogenicity and its involvement in transport of vescicles to the cell surface. Our res ults do not confirm the clinical pathology data of BKPyVAN biopsies which suggested that HLA class II might be reduced in interstitial nephritis due to the virus (Nickeleit, Hirsch et al. 2000). Conversely, our results would be in agreement with a recent study, where the expression of the HLA class I antigen presentation machinery components was investigated in BKPyVAN biopsies compared to T cell mediated rejection biopsies, and it resulted that infection with BKPyV did not h ave any effect, thus excluding BKPyV inhibitory role in this immune mechanism (Bue ttner, Xu et al. 2012). As the immune response to viruses is the result of many complex processes, against which viruses have evolved immune escape strategies , we cannot exclude that 125 agnoprotein could have a function targeting a diffe rent mechanism, therefore its function needs to be furtherly investigated also at the light of a recent finding that agnoprotein could have an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, as it has been observed that one of its potential cellular partner s is PCNA, and their interaction results in host cell proliferation, suggesting also possible role in switching off viral DNA replication to allow the assembly of genomes an d viral capsid proteins into infectious viral particles (Gerits, Johannessen et al. 2015). Futhermore, it has to be considered that BKPyV coul d be implicated in immune evasion mechanisms through the expression of a miRN A located in the EVGR, which was found to target the cell stress induced ligand ULBP3 (Bauman, Nachmani et al. 2011), dowregulating killing of infected cells by N K cells, and inhibiting the expression of the early protein LTag. LTag, is multifunctional regulatory protein of 695 amino acid lengths located in the EVGR, its expression is critical for viral replicat ion, it may be involved also in cell transformation, and it has been clearly demonstrate d that immune responses towards such protein are crucial in the control of viral replication, in fact in KTRs with active BKPyV replication LTag-specific T cell respo nses are barely detectable, and emerge after viral clearance (Binggeli, Egli et al. 2006, Binggeli, Egli et al. 2007, Azzi et al. 2007, Schachtner, Muller et al . 2011), in particular with an important CTL contribution. However, in most of stu dies T cell responses were measured by overlapping 15mer peptide pools, raisin g mixed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, so there is the need to understand the s pecific role of CD8+ T cells in BKPyV replication control. Identifying and characterizing T cell responses spe cific for the early viral region is clinical interest, as in a previous study it has be en shown that the decline of cellular immunity early after transplantation could identify patients at increased risk of BKPyV viremia, however the fact that no or low T cell res ponses could be found in almost half of patients gave to the results a very low pos itive predictive value for individual patients (Schachtner, Stein et al. 2015), needing a more efficient method for monitoring BKPyV specific T cell responses. In the second part of the project we could identify and characterize immunodominant 9mer-epitope T cell responses within BKPyV EVGR app roaching techniques of 126 predictive and experimental epitope mapping in heal thy individuals, thereafter we could transpose our methods to validate epitopes in a cohort of 19 pediatric KTRs. By in silico analysis of T cell epitopes within EVGR, we could identify 97 immunogenic 9mer sequences inside hotspot clusters and gaps for each of the 14 most frequent HLA-A and -B types present in Europe and USA. Predicted sequences were similarly clustered across different alleles, suggesting that maybe those sequences could correspond to domains in whic h the virus would be particularly susceptible to immune control and sele ction pressure. However, low levels of variants in epitopes sequences could be o bserved also in a recent paper in which T cell epitopes were studied by next generati on sequence of the viral genome from viremic patients, such observation may suggest that despite conservation, BKPyV variants may encode peptides that can escape the immune response and emerge in case of selection pressure given by an ev entual immunotherapy (Sahoo, Tan et al. 2015). Our protocol was successful in expanding EVGR speci fic T cells, the obtained CD8+ T cells showed a specificity towards predicted immu nodominant clusters, and demonstrated to be highly proliferating, as shown b y CSFE dye dilution, streptamer staining, CD107a staining ty by 51 Chromium release assay. This approach seemed therefore to overcome the prob lem of low frequency of BKPyV CD8+ T cell responses to overlapping 15mer pe ptides. From 97 candidate, 39 epitopes could elicit specifi c IFN- secretion in at least 30% of the studied healthy individuals by ELISpot assay, h owever these responses could not be attributed specifically to certain HLA types, th erefore we have performed streptamer staining, with the result of 21 epitopes which could be unambiguously presented by the tested HLA types, some of them res ulted restricted for a specific allele, whereas others could be presented by differ ent HLA alleles, often within the same cross reactive epitope group. Results obtained in healthy individuals could be tr anslated to the clinically relevant situation in pediatric KTRs. Ten of the 9mer epitop es identified in healthy participants were confirmed in KTRs, and 3 more epitopes were fo und only in KTRs, showing differences that could be due to the low frequency of specific T cells in healthy individuals, compared to the higher frequency in pa tients which were more persistently exposed to the virus. Discrepancies ma ybe also due to the fact that KTRs are susceptible to many infections, with conse quent presentation to T cells of 127 peptides derived from different viruses, some prese nting cross-reactive epitopes (Welsh, Selin et al, 2004). Comparing our results to previous studies, we could give a more complete panel of immunodominant epitopes across the most frequent HL A alleles, whereas most of the published sequences were studied in HLA-A*02 in dividuals (Li, Melenhorst et al. 2006, Provenzano, Bracci et al. 2006, Randhawa, Pop escu et al. 2006). With our methods we could anyway confirm most of the publish ed sequences, as HLA-A *02- restricted HLA-B 9m127, supporting our methods and the potential imm unodominance of the epitopes. In particular, these immunodominant 9mer T cell epi topes could be included in to BKPyV T cell immunity monitoring in kidney transpla nt patients to identify population at risk and help guiding immunosuppression reductio n. They can be also used to stimulate T cells for adoptive T cell therapy, as w ith streptamer technology epitopes specific T cells can be sorted and used in clinical settings (Freimuller, Stemberger et al. 2015), or eventually included in a peptide base d vaccine, to prevent virus related diseases. The evaluation of the impact of recipient HLA types and mismatches between the donor and the recipient in kidney trans plant context did not allow us to draw any clear conclusion, although a significant l ower presence of viremia in HLA- A*01 patients could be observed, the sample size fo r such analysis may be not large enough. The study has some limitations, that can underestim ate the range of detection of immunodominants epitopes, as the use of cryopreserv ed rather than fresh samples for KTRs, moreover we could observe that not all re sponses identified by ELISpot could be linked to at least one particular HLA type by streptamer staining, maybe due to low T cell frequencies, or perhaps such response s should be attributed to HLA types not included in the streptamer screening. Nev ertheless, our results are encouraging to take this approach to larger clinica l cohorts and relevant prospective study settings. In conclusion, our results gave new insight on diff erent interesting aspects of BKPyV specific immunity. On one side, we investigated on BKPyV agnoprotein, whose function has been unresolved despite many studies, and we could exclude its involvement in antigen presentation inhibition, des pite many observations were concordantly going to this direction. In the second study, we could identify and characterize a large panel of immunodominant epitop es, useful for monitoring BKPyV 128 specific immune responses in KTRs and possibly used in clinical protocols, or even in vaccine design, all aiming at preventing viral r elated diseases. 129 7 REFERENCES Abend, J.

L anzavecchia and F. the improves the and/or by providing co-stimulation nals. Antibodies: proteins of the immunoglobulin family, either pres ent on the surface of B cells, or secreted in response to antigen stimulati on, and binding specifically to epitopes. Antibody affinity : tendency of an antibody to bind to a specific epi tope at the surface of an antigen, reflecting the strength of t he interaction. Antibody avidity : sum of the epitope specific affinities for a give n antigen. Affinity maturation: somatic hypermutation and affinity-based selection of antigen- specific B cells leading antibodies production with increased affinity. Antigen: any molecule that can be recognized by the immune s ystem. Antigen presenting cell: cell that intakes antigens by endo- or phagocytosis mechanisms, then processes them into small peptides , and presents them at their surface through MHC molecules to activate T cells. Autophagy : self-degradative process that is important for ba lancing sources of energy at critical times in response to nutrient st ress. Autophagy has an important role in removing misfolded or aggregated proteins, clearing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and per oxisomes, as as eliminating intracellular pathogens. B cell receptor (BCR): Transmembrane receptor of B cells recognizing an ep itope; Capsid: protein shell which surrounds and protects the vira l genome. It consists of multiple protein sub-units called capsomers. 156 Caspases: group of enzymes involved in the apoptotic process . All caspases are produced in cells as catalytically inactive zymogen es and must undergo proteolytic activation during apoptosis. Activation of effector caspases is carried out by an caspases . Once activated, the effector caspases are responsi ble for the proteolytic cleavage of cellular targets, which ult imately leads to cell death. Chemokine: group of small cytokines involved in immune and inf lammatory processes. Chemokines are involved in the developme nt of dendritic, B and T cells, and lymphoid cell trafficking. Cluster of differentiation (CD) : identifies cell surface molecules for immunophenotyping of cells. Complement system cascade : enzymes cascade mediating the immune response against infection, constituted of several effector and regulatory components. Complement activation has three main pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. Activation of the classical pathway occur s when the fraction C1 binds to antibody or directly to activating surfaces. The le ctin pathway is triggered by recognition of carbohydrate residues found mainly o n bacteria by mannose binding lectin, whereas the alternative pathway starts when C3 binds to a suitable activating surface. The three pathways converge into a final c ommon pathway and lead to the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC), which forms pores on the surface of the targeted cell with consequent lysis. Costimulatory molecules: molecules expressed at the surface of antigen presenting cells upon activation and deliver stimul atory signals to T and B cells. Cytokines: a superfamily of soluble protein mediators and comm unicators released from cells by specific stimuli. They modulate the d ifferentiation and division of hematopoietic cells and the activation of lymphocyt es and phagocytes. They can be mediators of inflammation. In general they exert mo re than one function. Cyclosporine: 11 aa cyclic peptide which, bindinding to cyclophi lin, calcineurin Dendritic Cells (DCs): specialized antigen-processing and presenti ng cells, endowed with a high phagocytic capability when imma ture, and acquiring high 157 cytokine producing capacity as mature cells. DCs re gulate T cell responses both in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. A subset o f DCs is constituted by Plasmacytoid DCs . They are present in the bone marrow and all perip heral organs, and respond to viral infection with a massive produ ction of type I interferons, however, they also can act as antigen presenting ce lls and control T cell responses. Envelope: lipoprotein membrane which can surround viruses, de rived from the plasma membrane of the host cell. Epitope: antigenic determinant of a molecule that binds a co gnate T or B cell receptor, triggering the activation of adaptive imm une response. Germinal center: dynamic structure that develops in spleen/nodes in response to an antigenic stimulation. It includes a monoclonal po pulation of antigen-specific B cells that proliferate and differentiate thanks to the in teraction with follicular dendritic cells and Th cells. Immunoglobulin class switch recombina tion, affinity maturation, B cell selection and differentiation into plasma cells or memory B cells essentially occur in germinal centers. Granzymes: serine proteases found in granules of CTLs, which may enter target cells via perforin pores to activate enzyme involve d in DNA degradation and apoptosis. Immunodominance: highly immunogenicity of an epitope, resulting in a predominant immune response towards it. An epitope is likely to be immunodominat when binds the presenting MHC molecule with high af finity, if the MHC-peptide complex is abundantly expressed on the antigen pres enting cell, and if there is a high frequency of specific precursor effector cells. Imm une response against different epitopes can be in competion with each other, durin g persistent infections the immunodominant epitope induces the most significant response, excluding the others. Immunological memory: the ability to remember an encountered antigen lead ing to a quicker, and more potent immune response on the s ubsequent encounters with that antigen. 158 Infection : the process in which an infectious agent enters t he host. Most infections are followed by replication of the microbe in the h ost. Infectious disease : clinical manifestation of damage caused by a host -microbe interaction. Inflammasomes: molecular complexes activated upon cellular infect ion or stress leading to the maturation of proinflammatory cytoki nes such as interleukin-1 to start the innate immune defenses. Isotype switching: Switch of immunoglobulin expression and production from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE, occurring during B cell differentiation through DNA recombination Macrophages: phagocytic cells resident in lymphoid and non-lymp hoid display a broad range of pathogen recog nition receptors making them efficient at phagocytosis of inflamm atory cytokines. Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC): large group of genes dresponsible for antigen presentation to T cells. In humans is also known as Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). MHC restriction: Recognition of antigen by particular MHC molecules . MicroRNA: piece of about 21-23 bases length of single-strande d RNA binding to a complementary mRNA, leading to a decrease in the pr oduction of the corresponding protein. Monocytes Monocytes are immune effector cells, displaying ch emokine receptors and pathogen recognition receptors that mediate mig ration from blood to tissues during infection. They produce inflammatory cytokin es and take up cells and toxic molecules. They can also differentiate into inflamm atory DCs or macrophages during inflammation. Natural killer (NK) cells: Lymphocytes of the innate immune system displaying different inhibitory and activating cell surface re ceptors which balance their activation and ability to kill target cells and produce cytoki nes. 159 Non-self: any antigen that is not normally present in that in dividual. Open reading frame: continuous stretch of codons that potentially cod e for a protein or peptide. Opsonization: process in which particles, microorganisms, and im mune complexes are coated with molecules which allow them to bind receptors on phagocytes, enhancing their uptake. Paratope: region of a B or T cell receptor that recognizes an d binds a cognate epitope Pathogen: organism able to cause disease in a susceptible ho st Phagosome: membrane bound intrecellular vescicle which contai n phagocytosed material. Peptide: Short chain of linked amino acids. Perforin : Pore-forming molecule related to terminal complem ent fraction C9, which polyimerize on the target cells to form channels. Persistent infection : infection in which the host response cannot compl etely clear the microbe. During persistent infection the microb e can be produced in the cell with no or minimal cytopathic effect thereby enabling lo ng-term infection. Persistent infections may have silent stages, but can also evo lve into overt disease, depending on the balance between host and microbe. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs): also known as granulocytes, as they are leukocytes characterized by the presence of cytopla smic granules. They include neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes. They inges then release proteins (e.g. defensis, proteolytic enzymes) conta ined in their granules to eliminate them. Basophils are characterized by granules containing histamine, heparin, peroxidase, important in the inflammatory response. 160 Eosinophils have granules rich in cationic proteins , they produce toxic oxygen radicals. They are antigen presenting cells, and ex press both hematopoietic and inflammatory cytokines. Proteasome : multisubunit enzyme complex essential in degradati on of proteins and generation of peptides. It is also important in the regulation of proteins that control cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. Reactivation : Active viral replication after a period of latenc y. Recombinant: Produced by genetic engineering. Repertoire: the sum of antigen receptors produced by the immun e system of an indivividual . Self (antigen): any antigen normally present in that individual. Sirolimus: triene macrolide binding to FKBP12, inhibiting mam malian target rapamycin and IL-2 driven T cell proliferation. Somatic hypermutation: process that introduces random mutation in the vari able region of the B cell receptor locus during B cell p roliferation at an extremely high rate. Somatic recombination: rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments in T and B cell receptors, genera ting the repertoire of specificities of the adaptive immune response. Tacrolimus: macrolide antibiotic binding to FKBP12, inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase and T cell activation. T cell receptor: Transmembrance protein expressed on mature T cell, which specifically recognize MHC-peptide complexes. The r eceptor consists of a heterodimer responsible for antigen-MHC binding and a cluster of associated membrane-bound polypeptides, the CD3 complex. Tolerance: acquisition of non-responsiveness to a molecule re cognized by the immune system. 161 Viral replication : process resulting in the production of new viruse s. It involves multiple steps, starting from virus attachment to t he host cell surface by binding specific receptors, then penetration into the cell, uncoating of the viral genome to permit transcription, then virion assembly consisti ng in bringing together the new nucleic acid and the structural proteins, and final ly the release out of the infected cell. Viremia: presence of viral genome in the blood. Viruria : presence of viral genome in the urines. Virus: the smallest of all self-replicating organisms pre sent in nature, being constituted in the most basic cases by a little as a small segment of nucleic acid encapsidated in a protein shell. Viruses do not hav e their own metabolism, rather they need to parasitize cells and subvert their int racellular machinery in order to replicate and possibly transmit to new potential ho sts. 162 9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS First, I would like to thank Professor Hans H.
