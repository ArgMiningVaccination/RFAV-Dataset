It is the foundational healing wisdom of our planet, the wisdom that explains the workings of nature and our interconnectedness with it. With Ayurveda we gain understanding of the forces of nature at work within one's body, mind and soul and how we are governed by the same patterns a nd rhythms that govern all of nature. This amazing k nowledge allows us to take control of our own health and healing, as we gain an understanding of that which brings us balance and that which brings dis- harmony and imbalance. By learning to maintain harmony within ourselves, healing occurs at the deepest, most causal level. Ayurveda works not by just pacifying symptoms but by removing the causes of disease. With Cancer and most chronic imbalances - an integrative approach that combines both conventional medicine and Ayurvedic wisdom using therapies such as yoga, meditation, appropriate foods, chakra and energy work and lifestyle changes - is the best holistic treatment.

Frui ts and vegetables have been found to contain a wide range of vitamins and essentially prana that builds our ojas and prana. (Prana Is life force/qi/chi,. O jas refers to our vitality, immunity,energy,enthusiasm ) Meat takes longer to digest, is acidic, co ntains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites. According to Ayurveda u ndigested meat remaining in the intestines becomes putrefied and leads to more toxic buildup. Another concept in Ayurveda which relates to the subtle qualities of the mind, sheds light on the connection between what we bring in through all our senses and diet and how it affects the mind. Just like the doshas which define the unique psychological, physiological and energetic manifestation of a personality, these gunas of the mind are threefold: rajasic, tamasic and satwic . With reference to foods, nuts, organic and fresh fruits, vegetables , grains and seeds are considered best for everyone as they are more conducive in nurturing gentle,pure, light and harmonious thou ghts and feelings.. Furthermore, A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruit helps put the body into an alkaline environment.

Abhyanga ( warm oil massage) also stimulates lymph drainage and detoxification through the body's largest organ of elimination - the skin. Research suggests that sesame oil may have potential as a cancer fight er as it has antioxidant qualities which help fight free radicals. Pancha Karma combines all of the above along with other therapies for complete detoxification and rejuvenation.
