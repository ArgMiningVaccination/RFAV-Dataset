This course is a component of the [Future of Meditation Research project](http://noetic.org/science/resources-media/fomr-paper/). Led by the Institute of Noetic Sciences, a task force of meditation researchers and teachers developed recommendations for expanding the current meditation research field to include important yet often neglected topics, including experiences of oneness and perception; experiences of God, deities, and other non-physical entities. Some researchers view some of the topics reviewed in this course as not being amenable to scientific investigation, or inherently \"unscientific.\" We disagree. While some of these domains are unconventional and potentially controversial, they are common, important to people, and can be subjected to rigorous scientific investigation. These arenas represent largely uncharted scientific terrain and provide excellent opportunities for both new and experienced researchers. In this course, over 20 leading scientists in the field of meditation research provide suggestions for future directions, and further reading and resources for deeper exploration. "}
