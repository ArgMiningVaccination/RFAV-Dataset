Of this, 60 million salmon were identified as ocean ranched. Therefore ocean ranched salmon represented over 41% of the \"wild-caught\" Pacific salmon commercial catch in Alaska http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/FedAidPDFs/fmr09 -08.pdf Grow fish in inland tanks BML SEMINAR 5/9/2012 More about recirculating -water land-based aquaculture systems A relatively new method of aquaculture involves growing fish in tanks in inland locations away from the native habitat of the fish. Fish spend their entire lives in these fully contained tanks. The tanks may hold either fresh or salt water (Atlantic salmon are able to spend their lives in fresh water, as many live in land-locked fresh water lakes). Temperature, oxygen levels, food delivery, and waste removal are monitored carefully. As the fish increase in size from the 100 gram smolt -size to more market sized animals, they are graded and moved into additional and/or larger tanks to ensure that the density of the animals is kept at appropriate levels. Fish are harvested directly from the tanks, processed, and sent to market.

In January 2009, the Food and Drug Administration issued a final guidance for industry on the regulation of genetically engineered (GE) animals ( had 28,000 comments on draft!! ) FDA plans to regulate GE animals under the new animal drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). . http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM113903.pdf Animal Biotechnology and Genomics Education BML Animal Drug\" approach The recombinant DNA (rDNA ) construct is a new animal drug because it is \"an article intended to alter the structure or function\" of the animal. New animal drugs may be approved if they are shown to be safe and effective for the intended use. In a hierarchical risk -based multistep scientific review the agency examines the safety of the rDNA construct to the animal, the safety of food from the animal, and any environmental impacts posed, as well as the extent to which the performance claims made for the animal are met.

BML SEMINAR 5/9/2012 Animal Biotechnology and Genomics Education Food/Feed Safety : Does food or feed from the GE animal pose any risk to humans or animals consuming edible products from GE animals compared with the appropriate non -transgenic comparators? Conclusion of food/feed safely evaluations: \"We therefore conclude the food from AquAdvantage Salmon (the triploid ABT salmon) that is the subject of this application is as safe as food from conventional Atlantic salmon, and that there is a reasonably certainty of no harm from the consumption of food from this animal. No animal feed consumption concerns were identified \".

There are multiple and redundant physical and mechanical barriers in place to prevent the accidental release of eggs and/or fish to nearby aquatic environments... a minimum of three to five mechanical barriers in place for all internal flow streams which release water to the environment. Standards and has been verified by an FDA inspection or site visit . Therefore, the likelihood is considered very low that AquAdvantage Salmon will escape from confinement at these sites. Where will the AquAdvantage Salmon be raised? If approved, the AquAdvantage Salmon will be raised in inland tanks . They will not be raised in ocean net pens.
