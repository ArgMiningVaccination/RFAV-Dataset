Stress levels are powerful. Chronic stress quickly runs the body down, causing normally functioning systems of the body to \"shut down\" (even if temporarily) so that the vital functions of the body - heart, lungs and nervous system - can maintain function to keep us alive. One of the body systems readily affected by stress because it is not necessarily vital to keep us alive, is the reproductive system. Research has proven that [stress impacts fertility health](http://natural-fertility-info.com/stress-and-your-fertility.html) by causing levels of stress hormones such as cortisol to increase, in turn inhibiting the body's main sex hormone GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) and subsequently suppressing ovulation in women, sperm count in men and sexual activity and hormone balance in both women and men. Infertility definitely causes varying levels of stress, but stress from our daily lives - work, a commute, an overbooked schedule, managing a home and the demands of family - also impact our levels of stress. It is important to create a stress reduction plan for yourself that includes mind and body therapies, as well as a few small indulgences, that you can use at a moment's notice and in any stressful situation. 10 Mind & Body Therapies to Help With Fertility Stress 1.

Art In [The Healing Power of Art - Interview with Artist & Doula Amy Haderer](http://natural-fertility-info.com/interview-artist-amy-haderer.html), Amy herself says it best, \"I think symbols are powerful and can sometimes communicate more than words can. Someone can see a piece of artwork and it will mean something different to them because it is steeped in their own experience. So, I think that creating a piece about something difficult can be very healing for people and can symbolize different things about their own journey.\" 8. Music I think a similar sentiment can be uttered about music. While many of us won't ever write our own song, many other artists have and each of us is likely to have a few songs that take us to our happy place, or bring our minds to a meditative state. I know I do! What are your favorite songs? If you haven't already, create a playlist to listen to in a quiet place with your favorite herbal tea.
