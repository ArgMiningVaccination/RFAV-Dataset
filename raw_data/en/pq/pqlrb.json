Chief of Staff Report 2. Chief of Staff Action List pg. 1 ZSFG CHIEF OF STAFF REPORT Presented to the JCC -ZSFG on January 24 , 2023 December 2022 and January 2023 MEC Meeting s CLINICAL SERVICE REPORT S: A. Radiology Service - Mark Wilson, MD, Chief The highlights of the report are as follows: 1. Scope of Clinical Service a. Scope of Service Comprehensive provision of diagnostic imaging and interventional services 24/7 to the hospital Inpatient IR admitting service Outpatient IR service and spine clinics Support Stroke Care, Trauma, Oncology, Women's Health, O R functions, Inpatient, and Outpatient services b. Services Provided - These include the following: (1) abdominal imaging, (2) thoracic imaging, (3) neuroimaging, (4) general and OB ultrasound, (5) breast imaging and tomosynthesis, (6) musculoskeletal emerge ncy imaging, (7) interventional radiology, (8) neurointerventional radiology and stroke support, and (9) after -hours emergency radiology service c. Imaging Modalities - The Service offers all the necessary imaging modalities which are distributed between Building 5 and 25. Building 5 - The current configuration includes the 1.5T MRI scanner and 1 CT scanner which will both be due for update soon. In addition, there is an IR Suite with an incorporated CT scanner and where outpatient interventional r adiology procedures are performed. Also, there are outpatient ultrasound, general X -ray rooms, and portable X -ray. Avon Center - At the Center, the Service provides general mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, breast US, breast biopsy and needle, loc alization (for lumpectomy), and DEXA bone densitometry unit. Moreover, there is a mammography van that recently resumed operating and is able to provide greater access for women throughout the city. Building 25 - The use of Building 25 has been extremely h elpful in providing various services to the Department's patients, staff, faculty, learners. At Building 25, there are 2 MRI scanners (with 1 innovative intra -operative scanner used often for stroke intervention, neuroimaging, and trauma neuroimaging in a very safe environment ), 4 CT scanners (2 in ED, 2 in basement level), IR Suite (with a CT scanner that is helpful for non -vascular interventions), 2 Biplane IR Suites (1 is Cath Lab and 1 for neurointerventional stroke treatments), hybrid OR/IR Suite (OR 8 - a potential site for treatment of trauma patients), and inpatient ultrasound (3 bays and 1 portable). In addition, there are general X -ray rooms, fluoroscopy, and portable X -ray. d. Structure of the Service Leadership Structure - The Service is led by Dr. Christopher Hess as UCSF Chair; Dr. Wilson as the Chief; Ms. Lorel Hiramoto as Site Director; and Ms. Loretta Johnson as the Interim Director of Imaging, Avon, and Interventional Services. Additional Leadership Structure - It was developed and create d additional directorship roles to not only help with operations but also to provide leadership opportunities for several faculty members. A list of the directors was provided. 2. Faculty and Residents a. Faculty - There are 17 active faculty who cover various modalities/specialties. Several of them cover 3 services which extensively help in treating patients and teaching learners. Also, there are courtesy faculty with most rotating from Parnass us or Mission Bay. They work part -time anywhere from 10 to 20% eff ort, and there is courtesy coverage in most radiology subspecialty areas. Two new faculty who joined this academic year were noted, along with new courtesy faculty. b. Training Program - The Residency Program Director is Dr. Soonmee Cha, and the Associate Pr ogram Director is Dr. Jason Talbott. The program has been ranked the top Diagnostic Radiology Residency Program for several years; this has been attributed to ZSFG's role as a vital educational hub for the Program. Resident Training o 13 residents each rota tion block: 5 PGY 2 level, 5 PGY 3 level, and 3 PGY 4 -5 level o 4-week rotation blocks in all radiology specialties o Direct attending -to-resident teaching daily in each specialty o Residents begin night -float call in PGY 3, working with ER attendings up to midn ight and with remote attending back -up after 12 am - 8 am Resident Education Activities and Resources o Detailed core curriculum of lectures (American Board of Radiology requirement) o Teaching conference twice daily o Learning and IT resources in all reading rooms o Minagi Library (video conference and new AV equipment) o Various resources for training and procedures o Monthly meetings with the Program Director and Department Chair There has been a >99% pass rate on American Board of Radiology examination ov er last 10 years. Fellowship Training o Abdominal Imaging Fellowship - This is a combined fellowship with 10 FTEs. Three of whom rotate at ZSFG, while another 3 at the VA and 4 at UC Health sites. o Breast Imaging Fellowship - There are 2 FTEs rotating. o Neuro radiology Fellowship - There is 20% FTE effort. pg. 2 c. Clinical and Teaching Conferences - There is a host of clinical and teaching conferences within the Department with some in lobbying learners and some in lobbying faculty members from other departments. Thes e include aforementioned resident conferences, Med -Surg conference, Gyn. Tumor Board, OB/GYN conference, and others. 3. Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Initiatives a. PIPS Projects - The following are the projects that the Department has been working on for the past 1 - 2 years: Contrast Extravasation Workflow - Contrast extravasation has always been a problem with power injection of contrasts mainly for CT scans. EPIC reporting has been used to develop way for tracking these extravasations; th e Service is ensuring that everything that happens is tracked, along with following up with patients and obtaining additional consultation if necessary. The goal is to prevent these extravasations. Peer Learning - This project is funded by UC -wide RM grant to help improve delivery of patient care. A tool for radiologists was developed to give feedback to other radiologists on errors in interpretation. There can be direct conversations; many cases can subsequently be tracked and reviewed during the monthly Q A forum with faculty and learners. The goal is to track and avoid common diagnostic errors that impact patient safety. Emergency Radiology (ER) Service - This is a major and most recent project. o Background - This is based on the fact that the Radiology S ervice is a resident -run Department after hours for the most part. There is an attending backup, but there is still a problem with patients being discharged from the ED. There could be a misdiagnosis based on resident's prelim interpretation. In some cases , the Department might not be able to reach these patients to call them back the next day that creates an operational problem and problems for the patient (i.e., the need to go back to the hospital). Sometimes, especially for the undomiciled patients, it c an be difficult to track them down the following day. Before implementing the ER Service, one to two discharged patients per day were being called back. o Multi -Disciplinary Project - Thus, the need to do better was realized from preventing these incidents; this new service was developed to address the issue. It is a multi -disciplinary effort that involves Radiology, ED, Trauma Surgery, and RM. A few years ago, Dr. Wilson and Ms. Turner created an ED Radiology Council which is the perfect form for discussions to develop this service, as well as to address other issues that affect the 2 departments of ED and Radiology. o Goals - It is notable that medical imaging has grown over time, and the types of studies have become more complex and numerous. The Service fel t that to provide the best patient safety, it needed to have an attending presence after hours to help interpret exams. The target was to have attending coverage during times of the day where there is the largest volume of exams. Also, the Service wanted t o reduce discrepant overread rate by 40 -50%. o Distribution of Exams - In a day, the largest volume occurs during daytime hours from 8 am - 5 pm. The second largest volume is evening hours from 5 pm - midnight. There has been attending coverage during daytim e hours. However, the Service felt that it would be very helpful to cover the evening hours which led to having an in -house or active attending radiology service coverage. For the night hours from midnight to 8 am the following day, the volume is much less as compared to daytime and evening hours. o Development of ER Section and Staffing - This service was developed with the City's support. Dr. Ehrlich, Ms. Turner, and Ms. Boffi extensively worked to support the patients and the Department. Through the Affili ation Agreement, the Dean's Office helped obtain funding for the newly formed service. Three faculty members comprise the service which started in July 2022. In November, the ER service was completely staffed. In the interim, there is faculty providing p er-diem coverage of the service during the transitional phase. The current turnaround time is < 60 minutes from the study being done to an attending read being rendered. o Total Overread Comparison - In analysis of data for July -Oct in 2021 vs July -Oct 2022 , there is a 60%+ reduction in overreads from discharged patients. A monthly graph of change in volume of overreads was presented and highlighted the reduction. Some of the overreads are still happening during the night hours; this matter will constantly b e analyzed for improvement. b. Patient Satisfaction - Surveys focused on patient wait times, clarity of communication, and explanation of what to expect when patients come for imaging study or procedure. All modalities were surveyed: US, CT, MRI, Mammography, and IR. These were assessed by using an NPS (Net Promoter Score) paradigm over a monthly NPS over the year. The NPS hovered around 70% which is good but indicative of further work needed to attain the 80% target. c. Faculty Committee Participation - A list of the faculty's involvement in committees was presented. Many faculty members participate in numerous committees within the Department and throughout the hospital, as well as in the UC -system wide. Some notable committees are the ED Radiology Council, PIP S, and Equity Council. 4. Faculty Research - It is a large Department with many interests and research topics. a. Research Projects - These include collaborative research pertaining to trauma, TBI, and spine injury with Dr. Geoff Manley's team. Also, there is a host of research opportunities in Diagnostic and interventional radiology. b. Funding - The talented faculty me mbers have obtained funding from various sources to support the projects. Funding has been provided by NIH, DOE, RSNA research awards, SIR research awards, AMFAR, and various industry grants from Siemens, CircuitRx, and Penumbra. 5. Financial Report - For FY2 2, the total revenue is $17.8M, and total expenses amount to $15.9M. The surplus is actually prior to the addition of new faculty hires. Thus, some of the surplus will be used to fund the new hires. Other investment of surplus fund s include the following: (1) hiring coding and billing support, (2) adding to teaching mission, (3) clinical support through NPs, (4) hiring IT expertise, and (5) support research mission. 6. Summary a. Strengths - These include skilled faculty in all areas of radiology; exceptional eq uipment and program opportunities with Bldg. 25; and strong collaboration between UCSF and DPH. pg. 3 b. Challenges - These include maintaining teaching and research opportunities with increasing clinical demands, along with maintaining a safe, caring, working, and learning environment during the pandemic. c. Goals - These include further collaboration to improve operational efficiency and continuing to regain ground loss during the pandemic. Another goal is maintaining a safe, caring, working, and learning environment within the Department and hospital. Dr. Winston acknowledged Dr. Wilson's outstanding report. Along with other MEC members, Dr. Winston also commended Dr. Wilson's exceptional leadership and expressed gratitude for the Department's various initiatives and projects, particularly the Peer Review and ER Service, which are focused on patient safety and families' concerns. Many appreciated the extensive collaborati on with Dr. Wilson and the Department, along with the Service's dedication to patient care. B. Dermatology Service - Erin Amerson, MD, Chief The highlights of the report are as follows: 1. Scope of Clinical Service a. Scope of Service - The scope of service is broad with the following: Adult Medical Dermatology, Pediatric Dermatology, Surgical Rheumatology/Dermatology, Hidradenitis , Hair, Pigmentary Disorders), and Phototherapy. b. Structure of the Clinical Service and Leadership Leadership - The Service is led by Dr. Erin Amerson as the Chief; Dr. Kieron Leslie as Assistant Chief; Dr. Aileen Chang as Inpatient Service Director; Dr. Dan Klufas as Derm Surgery Director; and Dr. Sarah Coates as Pediatric Dermatology Director. All, ex cept for Dr. Coates, hold other directorship positions to support the Service. Dermatology Faculty - There are 5 part -time faculty members providing care in Adult Medical Dermatology, along with 1 part-time faculty member each for Pediatric Dermatology, Dermatopathology , Hidradenitis, Pigmentary, and Hair. Administrative Staff and Support Staff - The Administrative Staff is headed by Ms. Mounira Kenaani as the Department Manager, and the Support Staff is led by Charles Bellah, RN as the Nurse Manager. c. Service Volume Outpatient Adult Dermatology Clinic - The annual average number of patients is 4,500 with about 90% seen in person and 10% by telephone/video. The pandemic allowed the Service to be more flexible in seeing patients virtually when convenient and feasible for them. For instance, patients taking Accutane for acne had to have a monthly clinic visit to receive the drug but opted to have video visits during the pandemic. E-Consults - The e -consult volume has surpassed live clinic volume with over 5K consults annually sine EPIC implementation . Prior to EPIC transition, the Service was already doing teledermatology e -consult process. Since the EPIC transition, e -consults have integrated into medical record which has been beneficial with same source o f information. With ease in submitting e -consults, volume has increased by 10% since implementation of EPIC 2 years ago and by 30% from pre-EPIC numbers. Moreover, the Service became interested on its impact to clinical efficiency, access, and cost of pat ient care with the Medweb extension . Additional details are as follows: o 60% virtual co -management - The Service gives advice based on photos to the PCP who is expected to implement the recommended treatment plan. The other 40% needs to be seen in clinic due to need for biopsy or presence of complications. o 20% increase in total patients managed or co -managed by Dermatology since teledermatology implementation (increase in access) - This volume is pre -EPIC, and volume is certainly higher post -EPIC. o Same number of providers (increased efficiency) o Cost analysis - savings of $140 per new patient referral (reduced cost of patient care) Other Services (Monthly Volume): Surgeries - 35; Pediatric - 60; and Phototherapy - 110 2. Faculty and Residents a. Number of Residents - There are 22 residents. Generally, there are 4 residents rotating at a time. b. Training Program Elements - These include all areas aforementioned in the Service's scope of service (The HIV Dermatology Clinic was noted as a unique learning opportunity for residents). In addition, the social determinants of health curriculum (SDOH) has been integrated into the residency teaching program. Every 2 years, the program cycles lectures that focus on items such as health access and health policy (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid) which are typically not taught but vital to understand for patient ca re. Other SDOH issues covered are refugee/migrant health, LGBTQ, and more. Other trainees include medical students (45/yr); Family Medicine, Pediatrics, and Internal Medicine residents (90/yr); HIV/Global Health Fellowship; and medical student fellows. c. Faculty's Roles - A list of the roles by various faculty in the Department, University, and the nation was presented. 3. PIPS Initiatives a. PIPS projects - There are 15 projects this year, and the following 2 projects were presented: BLSI: High -quality biopsy site photographs to prevent wrong -site surgery in Dermatology - The Service is gathering baseline data this year with the goal of 75% of photographs meeting the high -quality photography criterion. The current baseline is 54%. Appropriate HBV monitoring fo r patients on immunosuppressive medications - These patients tend to be the sickest ones in the Service with many on immunosuppressants. It was noted that the hospital's patient population includes many patients born in East Asia where HBV is very prevalen t. The project aims to standardize the process of monitoring patients with screening everyone and ensuring appropriate monitoring. The challenge is developing a workbench report as the Data Management Team encounters difficulty in pg. 4 building a workbench rep ort that retrieves patients who are on specific medication. It is fairly easy to pull out data by diagnosis but not all of the patients diagnosed with the same disease take medications that are being analyzed for HBV. Currently, there is a student fellow w ho is manually going through patient charts to obtain needed data. Data collection is truly a challenge, and there are ongoing efforts to build a workbench report in an automated way for patient monitoring. b. Patient Satisfaction Scores - The scores have been fairly stable at average of 72%. However, the scores decreased slightly by a couple of months at the end of 2021; the lower scores were most likely due to appointment delays and cancellations that had been caused by the surge. A thematic analysis of negat ive (17%) and positive (69%) comments was performed. The results indicated that only 4% of the negative comments pertained to negative experience with provider. Other factors (appointment delays, facilities, front desk staff) were out of the Service's cont rol. The positive comments included \"attentive, professional, and kind.\" 4. Research a. Scope of Research - The Service has always been strong on research related to HIV and Infectious Diseases, as well as Global Health and Migrant Health. With renewed focus on health equity in the nation, there is much work done by the Service in health equity/disparities, SDOH, and health care services/policy/informatics. There are also ongoing efforts on workforce diversity, medical dermatology linked with SDOH, and others. b. Key Projects - These include research on the following: (1) diversity and equity in Dermatology workforce; (2) HIV/STIs/Kaposi sarcoma/MPox; (3) skin infections (SSTI, telemedicine/teledermatology; (5) reactions to COVID -19 vaccines; and (6) SDOH , homelessness. c. Publications - In the last 2 years, six publications from the Service were included in its premier journal, JAMA Dermatology . A list of other publications was presented . These included the Service's work on DEI, along with study of skin d iseases among patients using methamphetamine (that did not have any prior dermatology literature), and more . Though the Service is primarily a clinical group, it is fairly an active publi shing group. d. Clinical Trials - There are few active clinical trials . These include therapeutic trial for intralesional nonavalent HPV for genital condyloma, along with many studies on hidradenitis, mpox , and others. In addition, there are closed trials for patients with Cryopyrin -Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). 5. Financial Report a. Revenues - The Profee revenues average a little over $300K/year with the vast majority arising from the managed care distribution, amongst others. The Service is located at W ard 92 which is an FQH C (Federally Qualified Health Centers) space. Thus, most of revenues are channeled to the city rather than recognized as Profees. The c urrent plans include moving the Department's Surgical Service to a profee environment in July 2023. The 5 R surgery space has been designated primarily for gener al and plastic surgery for wound care and oasis; the space will be shared with the Service once it opens. A financial analysis indicated increased revenues for the hospital with the planned move. b. Expenditures - Most expenditures relate to faculty and staf f salaries, along with operating expenses. 6. Summary a. Strengths - These include the following: (1) engaged and mission -driven faculty; (2) stellar support staff and nurse manager; (3) talented residents; (4) diverse patient population; (5) commitment to DEI; (6) collaborative relationships with other specialties; (7) strong departmental and university representation; (8) national leadership in global health, telemedicine and HIV researc h; (9) collaboration with ZSFG Specialty Pharmacy, and (10) solid financia l position. b. Challenges - These include the following: (1) clinic space on Ward 92; (2) heavy reliance on Affiliation Agreement instead of Profees (restricted funding); (3) PIPS - data collection; (4) work compression , declining trainee evals, no dedicated resident for consult service ; (5) drug formulary limitations, and (6) research funding. c. Opportunities - These include the following: (1) national focus on research areas where hospital excels and has patient access (skin color, homelessness, equity, telemedicine, and health services); (2) move to 4B, 5R; (3) building Quality and Safety Program; (4) opportunities for data -driven research; (5) incorporating social care into special care - patient navigator; and ( 6) develop philanthropic funding for research mission. d. Goals Short -Term - These include the following : (1) increasing philanthropic and research grant funding; (2) improve Profee collections (5R, Mohls expansion opportunity) ; (3) expand clinical services to match patient population de mands; and (4) build QI/PIPS program. Long -Term - These include the following: (1) lead field in clinical expertise and research involving vulnerable populations; (2) continue to be the model program for dermatology in the safety net; and (3) secure endow ment for research program. Dr. Winston, along with other MEC members, expressed gratitude and appreciation for the amazing report and Service's efforts, especially its teledermatology program and PIPS projects. Moreover, Primary Care is particularly appr eciative of the opportunities from teledermatology.

Among the areas of continued growth is working to improve resuscitation and early stabilization of patients in hemorrhagic shock, operative rib and sternal fixation, and management/treatment of acute intra-abdominal infections. Two programs I have actively worked to improv e and develop is the colorectal and spine care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. I have worked collaboratively with the gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons to develop a multidisciplinary colorectal practice that provides comprehensive care for the spectrum of colorectal diseases. As a result of this program development, we have improved patient access to evaluation and management that has di rectly improved patient satisfaction. An improvement in our time to next available appointment has been reduced for 77 days to 19 days. Furthermore and more importantly, we have reduced emergent admissions while improving overall outcome. I have worked collaboratively with the orthopedic spine surgeons to improve access of patients to anterior spine fixation by providing anterior operative exposure. This has led to improved patient satisfaction, and the ability to do single approaches to spine fixation. Not only has this collaboration improved patient care, but has given an opportunity for surgical residents to be exposed to the techniques of anterior exposures to the thoracic and lumbar spine. I have been integrally involved in the improvement overall of care provided at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. I have been highly involved in the development and implementation of a number of protocols and guidelines for injured patients within our trauma program, and I am a member of the Surgical Executive Committee dedicated to improving OR efficiency and outcome. I have been integrally involved in the critical care and trauma care provided at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital as the Medical Director of our Trauma Surgical Services, and Interim Chief of Surgery. The work done at as a faculty member at University of California San Francisco and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital fo llows a nearly 20 year career dedicated to similar clinical service and patient care at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where my clinic work was recognized by numerous honors and awards. This included receiving local, regional and national recognition for patient satisfaction and outcome.

During my time at the University of Washington I was extremely involved in a number of University processes, and institutional processes at Harborview Medical Center. Upon joining Prepared: December 14, 2022 24 of 89 the faculty at the University of Washington/Harborview Medical Center I was named the medical director of our acute care trauma floor. This allowed me to provide guidance to the management of injured patients, and to put several processes in place for discharge and post discharge care. As the years progressed, I was recognized for my strong leadership within critical care and I was named the medical director of our Trauma Surgical ICU and Associate Program Director for the Surgical Critical Care fellowship at the University of Washington. This allowed me to work closely with the Chief of Surgery to further expand and grow our fellowship form 2 fellows per year to 7 fellows per year. During this time, I developed a multidisciplinary ICU journal club that was a multidisciplinary conference including medical, anesthesia, and surgical ICU providers. This allowed us to collaborate to improve overall care within Harborview Medical Center. As a result, when our Associate Medical Director left our institution I was named the interim Associate Medical Director for Critical Care services. During this time I lead to update our brain death criteria, developed a response to extubation and assessment of difficult airways, helped to develop and implement our mobilit y protocol, improve care in geriatric ICU patients, and ICU sign-out processes. This continued until I was tasked with helping to improve our OR efficiency and finical stability. This led to the creation of a new position which I was appointed to as Associate Medical Director for Surgical Services. In this role, I have helped to improve anesthesia and surgical collaboration, OR turn-over and first case starts, and minimize waste. Although these processes where in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, modification and further improvemen ts were required regarding communication, PPE, and testing all of which I helped to direct. In addition to these critical roles, I have been involved in a number of committees that have crossed over our entire medical system. Among these, was the UWMC Critical Care Council that oversaw critical care services across the entire medical system. As chair of this committee, I helped to develop and implement two critical care services at the University of Washington Medical Center at Mountlake which included both a Cardiothoracic ICU service, and Surgical Critical Care Service. These high intensity models have improved overall care and outcomes over the last decade. In addition, I have co-chaired not only our institutional VTE committee at Harborview Medical Center, but also our UWMC system wide VTE committee responsible for formalization of anticoagulation therapy and assessment of outcomes. Finally, I was involved in the initial overall response to the COVID-19 pandemic to restore operative efficiency system wide, and surgical COVID-19 processes for testing and safety as part of an oversight UW committee. Upon transitioning to UCSF, I began at Trauma Medical Director for Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. Critical to this position is maintaining a collaborative relationship, and to careful assess trauma outcomes. As a verified American College of Surgeons Level 1 trauma center, critical benchmarks and processes must be maintained. Several aspects of care haver required refocus, and intensive efforts to maintain quality improvements. Shortly after arrival I was additionally named Interim Chief of Surgery. As a result, I have focused on not only advancing our trauma program but have been responsible for the administration of the Division of Surgery at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. I have been actively involved in numerous committees within UCSF and ZSFG to ensure that both the Division of Surgery and the Trauma program are represented. This has allowed me to further evaluate, and put efforts into improving our education, research, and patient care. Prepared: December 14, 2022 25 of 89 Throughout my career I have been highly involved in multiple aspects of care, and have served to drive improvements overall in patient care, research, and education.

Specifically, this is important to providing optimal medical education, research, and clinical care. Without appropriate diversity and the ability to provide exceptional care without exception a disservice is delivered. In simple terms, all individuals deserve equal education and treatment. However, we are governed by bias, both explicit and implicit, and a culture that does not consistently support diversity. Despite this, diversity and equity which is essential must be central to the delivery of patient care, education, and research. This core value is critical to bringing together various points of views that will allow us to excel in each of these areas. As stated, the concept of diversity and equity must be considered a central tenant in education and training, research, and health care. This requires awareness of inequities among underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups. Although I grew up in a diverse area of Michigan, I was aware of economic inequities but unaware of the extent of inequities based on race and sexual orientation that existed beyond my community. It was during my first faculty position when I was alarming struck hearing that treatment should vary based on socioeconomic status. Obviously, my understanding of equality was na\u00efve as I could never have imagined that professionals in the health care field actually thought and openly spoke this way. This led to me focus on furthering my education on inequities that exist, and to truly self- reflect on my own personal bias. But this injustice is not simply limited to socioeconomic status, it additionally includes race and sexual orientation. As a healthcare leader and educator, I personally have strived to improving equity. As part of my training as a program director at the University of Washington, I had been fortunate to have received further training in implicit bias and inequities. This education and sustained commitment has enforced my personal commitment to making that fellowship in Surgical Critical Care diverse. I had made sure that equity and diversity was Prepared: December 14, 2022 29 of 89 part of the training program with selective didactics and education to all fellows. Furthermore, working in a county hospital providing care to all individuals regardless of age, gender, race, or sexual orientation allowed our fellowship to further explore and focus on diversity. The simple motto of my previous institution at Harborview Medical Center clearly demonstrates this importance, Exceptional Care without Exception. This is the same focus I have for each and every patient encounter. There is no selective VIP, rather all patients treated are VIPs. It has remained my focus to model this important concept, and as a full professor it is not only the expectation professionally but personally. This important to model for students, trainees, and staff taking care of these vulnerable patients. As a result, upon transitioning to the University of California San Francisco I have committed to fundamental aspects of diversity, equity and inclusion and became a DEI champion. It is a critical area that I have focused on in my leadership positions as both Trauma Medical Director, and Interim Chief of Surgery at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Although my research focus has been strongly associated with inflammatory changes following injury, I have focused continued research efforts on further exploring the role of palliative care in our elderly population, the financial effects on the uninsured, and the equitable delivery of health care and outcomes. My future goals and objectives are to maintain integrally involvement through education and mentorship to improve diversity, and growth within established programs by securing diversity, equity and inclusion as cornerstones towards recruitment. My experiences and training has allowed me to perform these roles in a variety of leadership positions, and my goal is to further this through integration of research to sustain changes. TEACHING AND MENTORING TEACHING SUMMARY Medical education is the cornerstone to providing and improving care to future generations. Through education of learners at all levels, we provide the tools required for these bright individuals to continue to advance care and provide optimal care to every patient. Education, however, is not limited to housestaff and medical students. It is as important to help provide education to prehospital and hospital providers overall. This is especially true in taking care of patients following traumatic injury. The management and treatment of this critical patient population requires coordinated care beginning in the field and throughout their hospitalization and discharge. Without appropriate education to each member of this team, optimal and equitable care cannot be provided. I have been involved throughout my career in the education of housestaff and medical students. In fact, I weekly preformed dedicated protected teaching rounds with the housestaff and medical students at Harborview Medical Center prior to joining the faculty at UCSF. The focus of these teaching rounds was through direct patient scenarios that provided insight into the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of critical ill surgical patients. Important in my role at the University of Washington as a Trauma Critical Care Surgeon and Director of Surgical Critical Care was to assure standard and evidence based practice. As a result, I additionally provided education to the prehospital providers of King County and nurses at Harborview Medical Center. Currently, as Trauma Medical Director at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center I have helped to establish a weekly education session, and rework previous teaching sessions including our morbidity and morality conference, and our surgical journal club. It is not only essential to have dedicate Prepared: December 14, 2022 30 of 89 education time, but to provide timely beside teaching and supplemental literature to support clinical practice. Delivering medical education requires ongoing refinement of teaching skills. Teaching adult learners requires a multi-domain approach that I have focused on. I have been fortunate to direct ATLS instructor courses that focuses on adult education along with Dr. Adnan Alseidi a dedicated surgical educator. Every time I direct this course, I learn new tools to further my ability to teach. I think it is imperative that we take each opportunity to learn to educate, and to provide education. The deliver cannot be confrontational, and must be given in a format that allows the learner to further expand their current knowledge by using their individual established foundation. Teaching is not limited to lectures; it includes all aspects of the medical care we provide. Important and critical to teaching effectively is the ability to receive and provide feedback. This is essential to improving knowledge and clinical care. Although at times difficult, as an educator it is an area that must be performed and requires continued refinement and individuality. This is potentially one of the most critical aspects required for growth as a medical provider. Finally, I have had the opportunity to serve as Program Director for the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and Trauma Medical Director at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Without any doubt, one of the proudest accomplishments I have for my career in these various roles is training an outstanding group of leaders in trauma and critical care surgery. As a result of these fundamental educational beliefs, I was awarded the John K. Stevenson Faculty Teaching Award in Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Providing and refinement of teaching is what we responsible for as faculty, and it is truly one of, if not, the most rewarding parts of our career.

It is truly one of the most essential components of academic surgery. Providing guidance to help develop the next group of surgeons. However, academic mentoring has not been limited to helping to guide and develop the next group of surgeon scientists, but also to develop the next group of clinical surgeons that can provide outstanding care without exception. For nearly two decades prior to arriving at UCSF in 2021, I was fortunate to serve as Associate Program Director or Program Director of Surgical Critical at the University of Washington School of Medicine. This was an honor, and has allowed me to work closely with outstanding fellows. Upon arriving at UCSF, I have been able to continue this mentoring role working closely with the surgical ciritcal care fellows and acute care surgery fellows as Trauma Medical Director and Interim Chief of Surgery. I am humbled to have played a critical but small role in each of their careers, and have been humbled by their career development. Many of them have become leaders regionally, nationally and internationally in the fields of trauma, critical care and burns. As a mentor, I take great pride in their outstanding achievements.

Assistant Professor of Surgery University of Washington RESEARCH AND CREA TIVE ACTIVITIES RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES SUMMARY Medical research is essential for the improvemen t in patient care. It requires a multifaceted approach in which the pathophysiology, disease progression, and therapeutic options evaluated and optimized. In order to do this, basic science research is required to provide insight into the pathophysiology. This understanding not only provides insight into the disease to help develop therapeutics, but it also helps direct individual care through precision medicine. I have been involved in research my entire career and have focused on the inflammatory changes following injury leading to the development of organ failure. Through this research, I have helped demonstrate that the inflammatory changes following injury are sustained for long periods, and are associated with long-term complications. In addition, through a number of collaborations I have helped develop a genomic signature that can identify injured patients at risk for complicated outcomes within 24 hours of injury. This genomic signature has been validated, and will hopefully help provide precision care in the future to this select patient population at the greatest risk for complications. Although my research has focused on trauma, research in all areas helps provide the foundation for critical thinking and improvement in patient care. My overall goal is to continue to further evaluate the acute inflammatory changes following injury, and help to determine potential areas of therapeutic intervention to the at risk patient population. This goal, however, is not limited to acute changes but the long term effects both clinical and immunologically due to injury. It is a result of this research that I hope we will be able to better predict and determine the course following multiple inflammatory disease processes, in addition to injury, to better inform patients and help with autonomous patient care decisions. It is imperative that overall we provide a collaborative atmosphere for research, and emphasize the importance and contributions that research provides. RESEARCH AWARDS - CURRENT 1. NCT02984384 Trauma Site PI 5 % effort O'Toole (PI) PICORI 7/1/2016 6/30/2022 PREVENTion of Clot in Orthopaedic Trauma (PREVENT CLOT) $ 11,198,854 total Prepared: December 14, 2022 48 of 89 There are 6 million fractures treated each year in the United States, and 2.3 million patients are admitted each year after trauma. Injuries t hat break certain bones, like the hip or thigh bone, are very common and associated with a particularly high risk of blood clots. If a patient does develop a blood clot, it can require the pati ent to take months of additional medications or can possibly even become fatal. However, medications to prevent blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding or other complications. Despite the frequency of these injuries and the potential devastating impact that blood clots can have on patients' lives, we currently do not know the best clot prevention medication for trauma patients. Current guidelines indicate that patients with certain fractures should be given medication to help prevent blood clots. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are medicines that have been used to prevent blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) of trauma patients since the 1990s. Today, despite a lack of good evidence, LMWHs remain in widespread use for patients with fractures. Aspirin is another commonly used clot prevention medici ne that may have a similar or even superior ability to prevent blood clots in the legs and potentially fatal clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) that can occur after a traumatic injury. However, there have not been any studies to date that compare LMWHs with aspirin in preventing blood clots in fracture patients. This study should answer a question that is important to the millions of people who suffer a traumatic injury every year in the United States and are therefore at high risk for a blood clot. The study will compare the rates of death, blood clots in the lung, complications after surgery, patient satisfaction, out-of-pocket costs, and minor blood clots in patients to determine which medication is more effective in blood clot prevention after fractures. Patients and stakeholders have already taken an active role in developing this research proposal. Our research team comprises trauma survivors, blood clot survivors, caregivers, frontline clinicians, professional organizations, medical insurers, and experts in this field of research. In preparation for this study, we surveyed 232 trauma patients to determine the outcomes related to blood clots that they believed were most important. Our study is designed to respond to the concerns expressed by those patients. Trauma patients have historically been under-represented in research. The time-sensitive nature of traumatic injuries and the complicated medical condition of trauma patients at the time of hospital admission has long been a deterrent to scientific investigation. Our patients and caregiver team members have been crucial to designing this study so that it answers an important research question for patients and physicians while being respectful to the challenging circumstances faced by patients and their caregivers.

An impaired innate immune response can aggravate the septic condition by compromising the patient s ability to combat an infection. However, the cells and mediators that enhance the innate immune response in sepsis are still unknown. Basophils account for less than 1% of peripheral blood leukocytes, which makes them the rarest known granulocytes. Basophils are evolutionarily conserved in many animal species, suggesting a beneficial rather than deleterious role of basophils. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether basophils play any role in the host s defense against bacteria that can potentially prevent sepsis development. Our preliminary studies support such a role by showing that basophils are one of the very first cells to accumulate at the infection site at early stages of infection, and can improve survival and bacteria clearance in the polymicrobial model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We think that our findings in the murine system may be translatable to humans because we observed that trauma patients show increased numbers of basophils in circulation when a nosocomial infection was circumscribed to local tissues (early stages of infection) while basophil numbers decreased or remain unchanged when a patient developed a systemic infection (bacteremia) and was therefore at high risk of developing sepsis. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that basophils play a protective role in sepsis by enhancing the innate immune response against infection. Accordingly, we propose a research plan aimed at investigating the contribution of basophils to the innate immune response against bacteria. In Aim 1, we will identify mechanisms involved in basophil activation during an infection. We will use a genetic approach to investigate whether basophil stimulation through the TLR and MyD88 pathways is required to induce basophil activation and to confer protection during an infection; and we will examine whether the epithelial cell-derived cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), can enhance the ability of basophils to respond to an infection. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which basophils confer protection against bacterial infections. Specifically, we will investigate interactions between basophils, the endothelium, and circulating leukocytes in a microvessel system and we will use mice with basophil-specific TNF deficiency to study these interactions during CLP. In Aim 3, we will establish the relevance of basophils in human infections and sepsis. Specifically, we will use mass cytometry (CyTOF) to assess basophil immune functions in samples collected from patients that develop nosocomial infections, mainly pneumonia, and we will establish whether these immune functions associate with clinical outcomes. We think that the studies proposed will expand our knowledge of sepsis physiopathology. Specifically, our studies will provide, for the first time, evidence for a critical role for basophils in the enhancement of the innate immune response against bacteria, an unexpected role for this rare cell population.

Muscle wasting occurs rapidly after major trauma and is often associated with multi-organ failure lasting from a few weeks to a long term disability. It is believed that FDY-5301 may help prevent or treat muscle weakness and organ dysfunction in major trauma patients. Approximately 252 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive up to 7 daily bolus IV doses of FDY-5301 at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, or volume-matched placebo. To ensure equal representation in each group, the randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of any pelvi c or lower limb fractures. All subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups (FDY-5301 low dose, FDY-5301 high dose, or placebo). All subjects will be followed in-hospital until Day 28 or discharge, whichever occurs first, at Day 28 if discharged earlier, and then by telephone visits at Month 3 and Month 6.

Taking a blood-thinning drug long-term is standard treatment for preventing a stroke or blood clots in the body. However, if a patient is in an accident, bleeding in the brain can cause serious disability and death. After a brain bleed, we need to know the best time to restart the blood thinning medication: starting too soon might increase the risk of recurrent bleeding, whereas waiting too long could result in a stroke or blood clot in the heart or lungs. The Restart trial has been designed to determine the best time to restart blood-thinning medication in participants like you. The type of blood thinner will be decided by the study doctor and could be any of the so-called direct oral anticoagulants listed above, but not warfarin. All the times we are studying, 1, 2 and 4 weeks, are within the standard of care. There are no other changes to your care other than randomizing the timing. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal time to start medication in participants that have had bleeding in the brain from trauma. 8.

Factor IX is the lead factor for the potency of the preparation as stated on the label. Antithrombin III, heparin, human albumin, hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride, sodium and sodium citrate are excipients. The preparation of BE1116 is sterile and pyrogen-free, and it does not contain antimicrobial preservatives. The production process of BE1116 contains various steps to inactivate / remove viruses. BE1116 is currently licensed under the brand names Kcentra\u00ae, Beriplex\u00ae P/N, Confidex\u00ae, or Coaplex\u00ae in approximately 50 countries worldwide. In all uncontrolled and controlled clinical studies of BE1116 in acute VKA reversal performed to date (333 total subjects treated with BE1116), BE1116 has been considered efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. Over 20 years of postmarketing ex perience also supports the favorable efficacy and safety profile of BE1116 established during the clinical studies. These include more than 10 years of clinical experience with the heat-treated predecessor of BE1116 (identified as HS ), and since 1996 with the heat-treated and virus-filtered BE1116 product (identified as P/N ).Nonclinical and preliminary clinical evidence indicates a possible therapeutic role of 4F-PCC in patients with acute major bleeding associated with traumatic injury. CSL intends to assess the therapeutic role of BE1116 at doses of 25 to 50 IU/kg in subjects with acute major bleeding associated with traumatic injury. 9.

A parallel observational cohort will include those who are disinclined to have their treatment choice randomized, but are willing to contribute information about their outcomes. The goal of the COSMID trial is to answer the question: For pati ents with QoL-limiting diverticular disease, is elective colectomy more effective than best medical management? Aim 1: Compare patient-reported outcomes (e.g., quality of life, work productivity, decisional regret) in patients with QoL-limiting diverticulitis randomized to el ective colectomy vs. best medical management. Exploratory Aim 1a. Compare characteristics of randomized patients to those who selected their treatment. Exploratory Aim 1b. For each treatment, compare patient reported outcomes in randomized patients to those who selected their treatment. Exploratory Aim 1c. Compare patient reported outcomes in the subgroups of patients with recurrent acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD) and those with symptoms after recovery from an episode of AUD randomized to elective colectomy vs. best m edical management. Aim 2: Compare clinical outcomes (e.g., rates of serious adverse events, number of subsequent episodes of diverticulitis) between patients with QoL-limiting diverticulitis randomized to elective colectomy vs. best medical management. Aim 3: Compare healthcare utilization between patients with QoL-limiting diverticulitis random ized to elective colectomy vs. best medical management.

Co-Investigato r 5 % effort Douglas (PI) Department of Defense The Fluid Responsiveness Evaluation in Patients with Undifferentiated Shock (FRESH-FIRST) The study is planned as a Phase III extension of Dr. Douglas recently reported prospective, randomized proof-of-concept pilot trial Fluid Response Evaluation in Sepsis Hypotension and Shock (FRESH) in adults with septic shock. The FRESH study compared passive leg raise (PLR) -guided stroke volume (SV) responsiveness as a guide for fluid management with usual care. It demonstrated significant reductions in administered fluids, the requirement for renal and respiratory organ failure support with numeric improvement in survival to hospital discharge. In FRESH-FIRST, we plan to expand this work to evaluate the efficacy of precision dynamic-response guided resuscitation in undifferentiated shock and to definitively determine the impact of this approach on patient survival and relevant patient-centered outcomes. This has direct applications to civilian and military medicine including patient resuscitation in far-forward military situations and managing common post-trauma and non-trauma conditions such as sepsis, hypovolemic shock, blunt trauma and burn-injured patients. Study participant identification, enrollment and intervention will start in the emergency department/trauma bay and continue when the patient is admitted to an intensive care unit.

K08GM068816 Primary Investigato r 75 % effort Cuschieri (PI) National Institutes of Health/NIGMS 9/1/2003 8/31/2008 Cellular Signaling Mechanisms Involved in Macrophage Priming and Activation. $ 129,330 direct/yr 1 $ 646,650 total Sepsis, following trauma/hemorrhage and ischemia/reperfusion, is a common etiology for subsequent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and remains a leading cause of subsequent morbidity and mortality. A number of different inflammatory cells are responsible for this condition; however, it appears that the macrophage is the common central orchestrating cell underlying these conditions. It is becoming evident that this inflammatory driven signaling cascade is affected by a number of different \"priming\" agents, such as platelet activating factor (PAF) and oxidant stress. \"Priming\" does not lead to pro-inflammatory mediator production; rather it causes enhanced responsiveness by the macrophage to secondary inflammatory stimuli, such as endotoxin. The mechanism in which these \"priming\" agents cause this enhanced response is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this grant is to better delineate the intracellular signaling mechanisms which are responsible for this affect. This proposal will focus on the potential role that the secondary messenger, calcium, plays during initial \"priming\". Although calcium flux occurs during \"priming\", it is unknown if and how calcium could modulate endotoxin-mediated signaling. We, therefore, hypothesis that the increase in intracellular calcium results in the activation of regulatory kinases, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK), leads to enhanced endotoxin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we hypothesis that CaMK activation leads to modulation of actin polymerization and stress fiber polymerization induced by endotoxin resulting in enhanced intracellular spatial relationships and optimal endotoxin signaling. The role of calcium and CaMK during \"priming\" will be investigated through the use of specific inhibitors and activators on the ability of PAF and oxidant stress to induce \"priming\" of endotoxin-mediated activation within the macrophage. The overall aim of this proposal is to provide further insight into potential mechanisms that serve in the activation and \"priming\" of the macrophage. Through an enhanced understanding of these mechanisms it is our goal that potential therapeutic targets may be discovered to regulate the inflammatory response following trauma/hemorrhage and ischemia/reperfusion.

A greater understanding of the innate inflammatory response to serious injury will lead to the development of novel genomic and proteomic markers that can predict outcome, and will identify potential new avenues for further basic and clinical research, as well as targets for immunomodulatory interventions. The Program is organized to employ multip le high-throughput analytical tools including microarray and comparative, quantitative proteomics coupled with novel macroscale and microfluidics cell separation methodologies and bioinformatics approaches (including knowledge-based pathway analysis). The specific aims in Years 6-10 are as follows. (1) Determine genome-wide expression and the cellular proteome from well-defined cellular subpopulations of circulating leukocytes from hospitalized patients following severe trauma and burn injuries. (2) In these cell populations, identify patterns of gene expression and proteomic responses to the innate inflammatory response associated with different clinical trajectories and outcomes. (3) Using a systems biology approach, discover new biological knowledge based upon total cellular proteomi cs and genomics obtained from the cellular subpopulations. New knowledge will be obtained by fostering and supporting groups of investigators in vastly disparate disciplines, including clinicians, biochemists, immunologists, statisticians, and computational and systems biologists. These interactions will lead to the development of new paradigms for our biological understanding of the injury response. The project tasks and activities include the following: (1) enrollment of 580 severely traumatized or burned patients with stringent entry criteria and standardized guidelines for patient care; (2) high-throughput quantitative, comparative proteomic and functional proteomic analyses of enriched blood leukocyte populations; (3) genome-wide expression analysis of these same leukocyte populations using state-of-the-art high throughput formats; (4) implementation of a web-enabled trauma-related database containing clinical, physiologic, proteomic, and genomic expression data; (5) computational analysis of the complex data by data interpretation groups, comprised of biostatisticians, critical care physicians and basic scientists with the ultimate goal being an integrated systems view of the injury response.

The mechanism in which these innate immune cells respond to these invaders is through the activation of a series of pattern recognition receptors or Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors, on specialized plasma membrane microdomains is complex and poorly elucidated. Based on previous work by us, we hypothesize that formation of these complexes requires breakdown of plasma membrane sphingolipids into ceramide leading to the formation of lipid raft macrodomains and the formation of TLR complexes. As a result, specific infectious factors are presented to these pattern recognition receptors leading to cellular activation. Although these responses may be life saving, severe trauma is know to result in reprogramming and alterations in innate immunity. These altered phenotypes, rather than leading to host protection, are responsible for increased susceptibility to invading organisms leading to the development of sepsis and organ failure. This state has been recreated in vitro by subjecting mononuclear cells to factors induced by trauma, including platelet activating factor, oxidant stress and complement 5a. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for this reprogramming remain unknown, previous work has demonstrated that this process is associated with alterations in the lipid and protein content within the plasma membrane. These alterations are hypothesized to occur on lipid rafts. Following injury, we hypothesize that factors induced by trauma result in the production of ceramide, but to a lesser degree than that seen during activation. Ceramide once produced fuses within rafts leading to the formation of macrodomains similar to that which occurs with activation. Additionally, ceramide leads to the mobilization of calcium leading to the activation of CaMK II. Activation of these cellular messengers is associated with the formation of focal adhesion-like complexes that contain some but not all of the TLR components. We hypothesize that assembly of these complexes and changes in lipid raft ceramide content are responsible for subsequent reprogramming that induces enhanced activation in response to subsequent infection. Thus, this proposal sets out to determine more fully the molecular mechanisms responsible for reprogramming and activation following trauma by exploring the effects of ceramide, calcium and CaMK II in vitro, and in severely injured trauma patients.

The subproject and investigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source, and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed is for the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator. Following severe trauma mononuclear cells are reprogrammed leading to alterations in innate immunity. These phenotypes are responsible for increased susceptibility to invading organisms leading to the development of organ failure. This state has been recreated in vitro by subjecting mononuclear cells to factors induced by trauma, including platelet activating factor (PAF), oxidant stress and complement 5a (C5a). Although the mechanism(s) responsible for this reprogramming remain unknown, previous work has demonstrated that this process may be associated with alterations in the protein content within specific plasma membrane microdomains that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids termed lipid rafts. Following injury, we hypothesize that factors induced by trauma result in the production of the lipid mediator ceramide from lipid rafts. Ceramide once produced fuses within rafts leading to the formation of macrodomains resulting in changes in membrane fluidity. Due to these changes, various proteins are recruited to the lipid raft resulting in the formation of focal adhesion-like complexes that contain some but not all of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) components. The following experimental approach will be followed: Differentiated THP-1 cells will be subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation for various periods of time up to 60 min. Selected cells will be pre-treated with PAF, hydrogen peroxide or C5a for periods of time up to 30-60 min. Lipid raft protein extraction will be performed using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Harvested proteins will then be used for analysis using the LC-ESI-MS system. It is our hypothesis that assembly of these complexes and changes in lipid raft content are responsible for subsequent reprogramming that induces enhanced activation in response to subsequent infection. Based on these in vitro observations, it is our hope to then explore potential changes that occur in severely injured trauma patients in order to determine potential prognostic and therapeutic targets.

The leading cause of late mortality following injury is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which results from dysfunctional inflammatory response of the patient early after injury. Previous studies, suggest that hypertonic saline may be beneficial in modulating this initial response and thus decrease the subsequent organ injury. These effects, which have been well described in the laboratory, have yet to be proven in humans, particularly in the setting of severe injury. This proposal takes advantage of a unique opportunity to obtain blood samples from patients enrolled in a NIH supported multi-center trial of hypertonic resuscitation and analyze their inflammatory responses early after injury. The proposed trial is to be conducted by the Resuscitation Outcom es Consortium (ROC), which consists often clinical centers in the US and Canada. This study is a three arm, blinded, randomized trial comparing 7.5% saline, 7.5% (0.9%) initial resuscitation fluid administered to patients in hypovelemic shock or with signs of sever traumatic brain injury. Three of the ROC clinical sites will collaborate to study then inflammation response of patients enrolled at theses sites. The specific aims include: Aim 1: To profile and characterize the phenotype of the innate and cellular immune systems in response to hypertonic resuscitation following injury. Aim 2: To define, in humans, the cellular mechanisms responsible for hypertonic modulation of the inflammatory response. Aim 3: To determine whether immunologic changes observed following hypertonic resuscitation associated with differences in clinical outcome as manifested by the development of organ dysfunction, and nosocomial infection. The results of these studies will provide valuable information to determine the ultimate therapeutic use of the resuscitation strategy.

R01GM081510 Site PI 5 % effort Sawyer (PI) National Institutes of Health, Large Scale Collaborative 8/11/2007 8/31/2014 SIS multicenter study of duration of antibiotics for intra-abdominal infection. $ 580,231 direct/yr 1 $ 2,725,894 total Prepared: December 14, 2022 59 of 89 The optimum duration of antibiotic therapy for intraabdominal infection remains unknown and has been identified by the Surgical Infection Society as a high priority for clinical research. The ultimate objective of our research is to optimize (and reduce) the duration of antibiotic therapy for intraabdominal infection throughout the world. The hypothesis to be tested is that four days of therapy for intraabdominal infection will lead to similar outcomes and a shorter duration of therapy when compared to a course based on the resolution of physiologic parameters in the setting of adequate operative or percutaneous intervention. This proposal is for a multicenter, randomized, double-blind (until the fourth day of therapy), non-inferiority clinical trial comparing a predetermined four days of antibiotic therapy to antibiotic therapy terminated one day after normalization of white blood cell count (= 11,000/ul) and normalization of systemic temperature (< 38.0\u00bf C) for one whole calendar day (and a maximum of 10 days of antibiotic therapy) in the setting of complicated intraabdominal infection treated with adequate source control. Inclusion criteria include age = 16 years, ability to obtain informed consent from the patient or surrogate, presence of an intraabdominal infection requiring any duration of hospitalization and managed with open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous intervention, and, adequate source control in the opinion of the local investigator and Principal Investigator. 1,120 patients will be enrolled to ensure adequate power to assess equivalence of the two arms. The primary endpoint will be percentage failure conditioned by assigned duration of antibiotic therapy (intent to treat analysis). Failure will be defined as need for reintervention (surgical or percutaneous), surgical site infection, or death within 30 days of the original intervention for intraabdominal infection. In addition, multiple secondary endpoints will be assessed, including duration of antibiotic therapy and the incidence of infection at non-abdominal and non-surgical wound sites, particularly with antibiotic-resistant pat hogens. The ultimate objective of our research is to change practice throughout the world, specifically by shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy for intraabdominal infections and thus decreasing resource utilization and decreasing the selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Over the past 4 years we have successfully recruited to fill our positions and have addressed a key concern that was raised in our previous competitive renewal regarding diversity in our program. We have paid particular attention to identifying and recruiting strong under-represented minority candidates. Our previous competitive renewal also focused upon the \"key initiatives\", defined by the leaders at the National Institutes of Health and termed the \"NIH Roadmap\". This had direct bearing on the structure and direction of this training program. Briefly, the key initiatives or themes are: (1) New Pathways to Discovery, (2) Research Teams of the Future and (3) Reengineering the Clinical Research Enterprise. We propose to continue to educate trainees in established molecular biology techniques and will expand their training to include cutting edge research and analysis (i.e. biomedical computing) techniques. Through collaborations with basic scientists and integration with the available research education programs at the University of Washington, we will expose trainees to broad-based research teams and programs. Trainee education and experience will continue to include concepts of translational research, whereby basic observations will be evaluated as potential diagnostic and therapeutic benefit for critically ill patients. In summary, we aim to prepare a diverse group of interested scientists for academic careers as independent investigators and educators. Through a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort, trainees learn how to identify important research questions, how to design, conduct and analyze experiments that will address these questions and how to translate their findings into clinically relevant intervent ions. RELEVANCE: Trauma remains an important public health problem. Injuries are responsible for a high proportion of deaths in people of all ages and medical care for injury victims is costly. Our training program has successfully educated surgeons, physicians and post-doctoral students in aspects of the applied biology of injury and inflammation. Graduates from our program have demonstrated a commitment to understanding the biology of injury and to the care of critically ill injury victims.

Despite intensive investigation, there are few pharmacologic interventions, and care is largely supportive. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a human herpesvirus that infects 50- 80% of healthy adults and establishes lifelong latency in the lung, generally causing overt disease only in severely immunosuppressed patients. CMV reactivation (vir al replication) from latency occurs in ~40% of CMV seropositive, otherwise immunocompetent persons during critical illness and is associated with worse clinical outcomes including increased mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased ICU length of stay. Compelling evidence implicating CMV reactivation as a causal contributor to morbidity and mortality in sepsis- associated respiratory failure comes from animal models and our recently completed NHLBI-funded phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of ganciclovir this CMV seropositive adults with sepsis-associated respiratory failure, ganciclovir effectively suppressed CMV replication, had an acceptable safety profile, and was associated with improved clinical outcomes, including increased ventilator-free days (VFD), shorter duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors, shorter ICU length of stay, and improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio in day-7 survivors. We hypothesize that IV ganciclovir administered early in critical illness will effectively suppress CMV reactivation in CMV seropositive adults with sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure, thereby reducing lung damage, accelerating recovery, and leading to improved clinical outcomes. We propose to conduct a phase 3 RCT to determine whether the antiviral drug ganciclovir given as prophylaxis improves VFDs and other clinically relevant outcomes when administered within 5 days of ICU admission to CMV seropositive immunocompetent adults with sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure. We will measure the effect of the study intervention on the primary trial outcome (VFDs) and secondary outcomes (mortality at 28 days, duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors, oxygenation, static respiratory system compliance, CMV plasma and lung reactivation, and a core set of longer-term outcomes at 6 months). In exploratory analyses, we will assess baseline factors as predictors for CMV reactivation, and characterize the relationship of CMV viral load kinetics with VFDs and other clinical outcomes. Our interdisciplinary team has unique experience in successfully coordinating multi-site multi-PI ICU-based RCTs. We have established a network of 19 clinical sites in the US, all of which have robust infrastructure for ICU clinical trials and proven ability to recruit patients into RCTs. If it is effective, this inexpensive and feasible intervention has the potential to significantly improve care of patients with sepsis-associated respiratory failure, substantially change clinical practice, and offer new insights into the sepsis-CMV reactivation relationship.

The major goal of this project is to elucidate the changes and verify gene changes following severe injury. $ 449,340 direct/yr 1 $ 1,820,579 total Prepared: December 14, 2022 62 of 89 Injuries continue to be the fifth leading cause of death overall and the leading cause of death for persons less than 45 years of age in the U.S. Multiorgan failure (MOF) and death remain unacceptably common in severely injured patients. In our recent Glue Grant study, 19% of severe trauma patients died, 41% developed MOF and the average time to recovery was 16 days. Despite an improved understanding of the basic pathophysiology of severe trauma and its sequelae, there are essentially no biol ogical response modifiers that have proven successful in prospective, randomized clinical tr ials. We propose that a significant proportion of patients who would generally meet the inclusion criteria for a study of severely injured patients, are not in need of immunomodulatory therapy and are not only unlikely to benefit but also suffer direct toxicity from such therapies. In contrast, there exists subset of patients who are going to have a protracted clinical course, and would benefit from interventional therapies with biological-response modifiers. The most important challenge today is to identify prospectively the subset of patients who are going to have a protracted clinical course, and would benefit from interventional t herapies with biological-response modifiers. We believe that we have developed such a prospective genomic test. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to prospectively validate a rapid genomic test obtained from blood leukocyte subpopulations of severely traumatized patients in the first 24 hrs after admission that can be used to discriminate those patients who will have a complicated clinical trajectory and would, therefore, be good candidates for interventional, immunomodulatory therapies. Based on our preliminary data, we have developed several genomic models based on total leukocyte and enriched blood neutrophils that retrospectively can identify patients who will have a poor clinical outcome and would benefit from interventional immunological therapies. Here, we propose to validate this approach in 200 severely traumatized patients enrolled at two geographically-distinct institutions. These genomic tests will be compared for their precision to standard anatomical and physiological scoring systems, and models based on plasma cytokine concentrations. If successful, these studies would dramatically alter how clinical trials in severely traumatized patients would be conducted in the future. A successful, rapid, prognostic genomic test would reduce the size, cost and time required to evaluate new drugs in this population by identifying individuals at risk of a complicated outcome.

In an effort to improve communication in the most critically ill patients, a hand-off tool was developed to provide essential components of individual patient condition and assessment of risk of worsening. Based on this tool, an assigned and constructed hand-off nightly will occur within the ICUs of the University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medi cal Center. Error rates will be looked at before and after implementation. Additionally, provider satisfaction will be determined. Primary Investigato r Prepared: December 14, 2022 63 of 89 12.

Drotrecogin alfa (activated), a recombinant form of human activated protein C, is the first therapeutic intervention shown to reduce all-cause mortality in severe sepsis. In the Phase 3 study (F1K-MC-EVAD; PROWESS), 1690 patients were randomly assigned to receive a 96-hour intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated) 24 micrograms/kg/h or placebo (850 patients and 840 patients, respectively). Overall, administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) yielded a clinically significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality: 24.7% of drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients died 30.8% of placebo patients (19.4% relative risk reduction; p=0.005; Bernard et al. 2001). The only safety concern noted in the Phase 3 trial was an increased risk of serious bleeding among drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients (3.5% versus 2.0% of placebo patients). The difference between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who experienced a serious bleeding event was due to the greater number of drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients who experienced a serious bleeding event that was related to a procedure (for example, bleeding that resulted from the placement of a catheter or nephrostomy tube). The number of patients who experienced spontaneous serious bleeding events was similar between the two treatment groups. The Regulatory authorities have approved the use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in severe sepsis patients with a high level of disease severity and risk of death. Thus, the regulatory authorities have requested a study evaluating drotrecogin alfa (activated) in a specific subpopulation of patients with severe sepsis and at lower risk of death Site PI 13.

A genomic storm in critically injured humans. J Exp Med. 2011:208(13):2581-90 In this paper the first four authors had equal contribution to the design, writing, and analysis of the data. This paper is an important paper that evaluated the genomic response following injury. It provided critical and novel insight into the immune response following injury. The study took part over nearly a 10 year period of time while severely blunt injured patients were prospectively enrolled with standardization of trauma care provided. During this period of time I was a site PI, and was at the primary enrolling center for the study. In addition, I served on the protocol and writing committees for the study. At completion of the enrollment, analysis was performed of all co llected samples and genome wide analysis was performed on circulating immune cells. The analysi s of this data demonstrated that immune dysfunction that was thought to be initially pro-inflammatory followed by an anti-inflammatory response was not the case. The data demonstrated concurrent pro and anti-inflammatory processes occurring immediately after severe injury, and these findings challenged historical dogma. Working together with all authors, we were able to clearly express these findings that have provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of organ failure and chronic critical illness following injury.

Benchmarking Outcomes in the Critically Injured Trauma Patient and the Effect of Implementing Standard Operating Procedures. Ann Surg. 2012:255(5):993-9 In this paper I was the primary author evaluating the effect of a set of standard operating procedures in trauma care among 7 different geographically disperse institutions. In this paper I contributed to concept, data collection, analysis, and writing of the manuscript. This paper demonstrates that by careful assessment standard operating procedures can be incorporated into clinical practice and can lead to overall improvement in care. Additionally, this paper demonstrated that although mortality was improved compared to a number of comparisons, the number of patients still su ffering from organ failure remained high. It further demonstrated for the first time the concept in sustained organ failure, as demonstrated by a prolonged period of organ dysfunction or time to recovery from organ failure. This has led to the concept of chronic critical illness following injury. 3.

Comparing clinical predictors of deep venous thrombosis versus pulmonary embolus after severe injury: a new paradigm for posttraumatic venous thromboembolism? J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2013:74(5):1231-7 In this paper I was the senior author of looking at the pathophysiology of a common complication following severe injury, venous thromboembolism. In this paper I was responsible for the concept, analysis, and writing. This paper demonstrates that this common complication that was thought to occur late, actually occurred frequently early following injury. In fact, based on this observation the pathophysiology for early pulmonary embolism appears to be more closely associate with primary chest injury and as a result primary pulmonary thrombosis. 4.

Crit Care Med. 2017 Dec;45(12):1989-1996 In this paper I was the second author looking at the epidemiology of chronic critical illness following severe trauma. In this paper I was responsible for concept, data collection, analysis, and critical review. I served to hel p mentor Dr. Mira, and worked closely with the senior author on the final publication. This paper provides further novel insight into the concept of chronic critical illness following severe injury, and that patients suffering from this condition have poor functional outcome following discharge and that this process is associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality up to a year following injury.

Changes in Error Patterns in Unanticipated Trauma Deaths Over 20 Years: In Pursuit of Zero Preventable Deaths. J Trauma Acute Care Surg 2020 Aug 6 In this paper I was the senior author looking critically at areas of improvement to minimize errors. I served to mentor the first author, and was involved in the concept, data organization, analysis, and critical review of the publication. This paper demonstrates an evolution of errors over a 20 year period of time as process improvement is implemented. That as an initially area of concern is addressed, new concerns develop that occur downstream. This important work demonstrates the importance of constant and careful process improvement to continue to optimize patient outcome. CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 1.

AAST.org 2021 ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP Of the major leadership roles I have had over the last several years, several have played critical roles in improving education and clinical care. The first leadership role was serving as Associat e Program Director or Program Director of the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at the University of Washington School of Medicine. During time in this role, I was responsible for the reorganization of the fellowship and further expansion of the fellowship from 2 fellows per year to 7. Additionally, within the fellowship the creation of three separate tracks focused on trauma, burn and cardiothoracic care. Each track provided an overview of surgical critical care with an emphasis on these specific areas. During the time in this leadership position I have been responsible for the education and training of 60 fellows. Many of whom have continued in academics and have become regional, national and international leaders. I have served a critical role in the development of critical care services across UW Medicine as medical director of the Trauma Surgical ICU at Harborview Medical Center, Acting Associate Medical Director of Critical Care overseeing 89 ICU beds at Harborview Medical Center, and chairing the UW Medicine Critical Care Committee that was responsible for the development of two high intensity ICU services at the University of Washington. During this time, I helped to lead our responses to the H1N1 and EBOLA pandemic, and still focus on our mission population of the underserved in King County, Washington. As Associate Medical Director of Surgical Services at the University of Washington I helped to improve overall efficiency, develop collaborations with nursing, anesthesia and surgery to optimize patient care and outcome. Furthermore, this role was instrumental in our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in developing our OR response as cases increased, and a mechanism to convert OR and PACU space to ICU space as needed. Furthermore, in this role I was critical to the development of our overall testing response to acute emergencies and surgical procedures to optimize patient care and staff safety. Upon arriving to UCSF, I served as the Trauma Medical Director at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. I have been fortunate to work with an outstanding group of surgeons, staff, and organization. Importantly in this role was to continue to further optimize the collaborations and care that was provided at ZSFG to injured patients. Through this relationships the care of injured patients has continue to improve, and identification of areas for continued improvement continue to be identified and worked on. Additionally, I have served since September 1, 2021 as the Interim Chief of Surgery at ZSFG. This has been incredibly rewarding as I have been given the opportunity to help develop the surgical program at ZSFG and it's interplay across UC Health. This position has allowed me to carefully work to make sure that the divisional focus is on optimization of patient care, education, and staff/faculty development. The highlight is the opportunity to work with outstanding young faculty and help to provide them with the needed support/mentorship to allow them to have the greatest success. In this role, I have been able to further strategize to further develop the overall program and work with other divisions/departments to improve education, research, and patient care.

DEVELOPMENT OF PRIVILEGE CRITERIA Imaging Clinical Service privileges are developed in accordance with ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws, Article V - Clinical Privileges, Rules and Regulations. B. ANNUAL REVIEW OF CLINICAL SERVICE PRIVILEGE REQUEST FORM The Imaging Clinical Service Privilege Request Form sha ll be reviewed annually. C. CLINICAL PRIVILEGES Imaging Clinical Service privileges shall be authorized in accordance with the ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws, Article V - Clinical Privileges, Rules and Regulations, as well as these Clinical Service Rules and Regula tions. All requests for clinical privileges will be evaluated and approved by the Chief of Radiology Clinical Service. D. TEMPORARY PRIVILEGES Temporary Privileges shall be authorized in accordance with the ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws Article V - Clinical Priv ileges , Rules and Regulations. IV. PROCTORING AND MONITORING A. REQUIREMENTS Before any new staff radiologist can independently perform clinical services, he/she will be assigned to a proctor by the chief of the service. Any staff radiologist who already has p rivileges in areas requested by the new staff radiologist may be asked to be a proctor. The proctoring staff radiologist will review a minimum of 50 examinations or procedures that encompass every area in which privileges were requested by the new staff r adiologist. If the new staff radiologist has requested a privilege that is not included in the proctoring radiologists' privileges, a second proctor may be assigned for evaluation of the specific privilege. The proctoring physician(s) will report his/her observations regarding the new radiologist and assess his/her ability to perform in all the areas that privileges were requested. Each staff radiologist will undergo peer review (proctoring and monitoring) by another staff radiologist once each year. Re view material will consist of ten (10) cases chosen by the examining physician to include cases in the primary area of expertise of the radiologist being proctored as well as additional cases that may occasionally be the responsibility of the radiologist ( i.e., on call). Both radiologists will dictate each case and the two reports compared by the Radiology Clinical Service QI Medical Director. Records will be kept and reported to the Radiology Clinical Service Department Chief, and the QI Medical Director (see proctoring form, Staff Physician Credentials Section). Both examiner and examinee will report significant Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 8 error to the Department QI Chief or QI Committee. Action to be taken may include consulting, remedial study, and/or clinical service in-service work, as appropriate. B. ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGES Requests for additional privileges for Imaging Clinical Service shall be in accordance with ZSFG Bylaws, Rules and Regulations. C. REMOVAL OF PRIVILEGES Requests for removal of privileges for Imaging Clinical Serv ice shall be in accordance with ZSFG Bylaws, Rules and Regulations. V. EDUCATION A. All Imaging Clinical Service faculty are required to obtain ongoing ACCME accredited continuing medical education in the area of diagnostic radiology or nuclear medicine. The minimum standards required are those that the American Medical Association requires for the certificate award. B. Imaging Services faculty that are full -time are allotted five weeks of meetings per year. C. Documentation of continuing education is provided on an annual curriculum vita required by all faculty prior to the June performance appraisal performed by the Chief of Service. VI. IMAGING SERVICES CLINICAL RESIDENT AND FELLOW TRAINING PROGRAM AND SUPERVISION The Department of Imaging Services considers all physicians participating in ACGME approved training programs to be resident physicians. It is the policy of the department that no residents can provide clinical services without the direct supervision of an attending faculty physician. Non-ACGME are credentialed to render final interpretations but are usually supervised by an attending . The training program currently consists of 13 resident FTEs and 5.2 fellow FTEs. All diagnostic imaging examinations performed by the Department of Imaging Services are interpreted and reported by one of the following procedures: 1. The examination is personally reviewed, interpreted and dictated by an attending faculty physician. 2. A res ident physician performs a review contemporaneous with an attending physician and then dictates a preliminary report of the results. The report is then reviewed by the attending faculty physician who signs a statement in the medical record confirming that he or she has personally reviewed both the examination and the resident's preliminary report and either agrees with the resident's description of the attending physician 's interpretation as originally dictated or has edited the resident's report to reflec t his or her opinion of the findings on the examination. 3. A resident physician performs a preliminary review of the examination and dictates a preliminary report of the results. The examination and the report are then reviewed by an attending faculty physician who signs a statement in the medical record confirming that he or she has personally reviewed both the examination and the resident's preliminary report and either agrees with the resident's interpretation as originally dictated or has edited the re sident's findings. If the resident's preliminary interpretation has been transmitted for use in the treatment of the patient (either orally or in writing) prior to the attending faculty physician's review of the examination and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 9 the attending physician s ignificantly disagrees with the resident's findings after personally reviewing the examination, the attending physician notifies the referring physician of his/her own opinion in addition to editing the resident's findings in the medical record. Attending faculty physicians must make every effort to review the examination in a timely manner after the resident's preliminary interpretation. In July 2022, an Em ergency Radiology Service was instituted. This has resulted in improved on -call resident superv ision, exp eidited attending readings of emergency after hours exams, and improved patient throughput in the ZSFG Emergency department. All invasive imaging procedures and therapeutic interventions are performed by attending radiologists or residents with direct personal supervision of an attending faculty radiologist. Some invasive therapeutic interventions performed in the Radiology Department (such as thoracentesis) are also performed at the bedside by non -radiologists without the need for imaging guid ance. Since only those patients with the most complex pathologic anatomy are referred for image -guided procedures, direct attending radiologist supervision is always required when radiology residents perform these procedures. In accordance with HCFA re gulations, for procedures performed by residents, the attending radiologist is in the procedure room directly supervising during the key portions of the procedure and in the immediate vicinity during the remainder of the procedure. To document the attendin g radiologist's involvement in the procedure he or she must sign a personal note on the radiology report describing his or her participation. The list of Major and Minor procedures performed in the department are in Appendix B. For all major procedures, the key components are described. VII. IMAGING SERVICES CLINICAL SERVICE CONSULTATION CRITERIA A. The Imaging Service provides informal consultation on a daily basis to all CHN healthcare providers upon demand. B.

The Dermatology Clinical Services provides diagnostic evaluation including skin biopsies, therapeutic regimens, ranging from pharmaceutical to phototherapy to ambulatory surgery, and patient education. The primary diagnoses relate to skin cancer, acute conditions such as infectious diseases of the skin and allergic con tact dermatitis, and chronic conditions such as acne, psoriasis and atopic and nummular dermatitis. Care is provided by attending physicians and resident physicians in dermatology. Important aspects of care for the Dermatology Clinical Services are: 1. Diagn osis and definitive treatment of acute and chronic skin cancer diseases 2. Photo therapy and photo chemotherapy 3. Chemotherapy 4.3. Isotretinoin Definitive procedural treatment of acnebenign and malignant skin lesions 5.4. Telemedicine co -management of simple dermatologic conditions 5.

MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS Membership on the Medical Staff of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital is a privilege which shall be extended only to those practitioners who are professionally competent and continually meet the qualifications, standards, and requirements set forth in ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations and accompanying manuals as well as these Clinical Service Rules and Regulatio ns. C. ORGANIZATION OF DERMATOLOGY CLINICAL SERVICE The Chief of Dermatology Clinical Services at ZSFG has overall responsibility for assuring quality of care through ongoing monitoring and evaluation of activities. This responsibility, however, is shared wi th the department representative of Performance Improvement and Patient Safety (PIPS) Committee. The PIPS Committee department representative prepares the minutes of the Departmental PIPS Plan, and also communicates directly with residents and staff regard ing Performance Improvement and Patient Safety activities. This representative is appointed annually by the Chief of Dermatology. II. CREDENTIALING The ZSFG Dermatology Clinical Services is a small department with a high degree of interaction and consultatio n. Difficult cases and routine consults are often seen by several attending physicians. Thus, the skills of the various physicians are well known among the staff. The attendings are also able to evaluate the skills of each other through cross -coverage of c linics and through patients who return to other clinic days and attendings, although to promote attending continuity is not the rule. The staff physicians are evaluated yearly by the Chief of Dermatology for clinical competence, educational competence, per sonal qualities, and administrative skills. 4 Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Ave San Francisco, CA 94110 Where patient care falls below standard levels, the Chief will be responsible for counseling involved faculty and for taking whatever action is necessary to assure that appropriate corrections are made. 5 Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center 1001 Potrero Ave San Francisco, CA 94110 A. NEW APPOINTMENTS The process of application for membership to the Medical Staff of ZSFG through the Dermatology Clinical Service is in accord ance with ZSFG Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations, as well as these Clinical Service Rules and Regulations. B. REAPPOINTMENTS The process of reappointment to the Medical Staff of ZSFG through the Dermatology Clinical Service is in accordance with ZSFG Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, as well as these Clinical Service Rules and Regulations . 1. Practitioners Performance Profiles The Dermatology Clinical Service practitioners are evaluated by the following factors. Dermatology attendings in the clinic act as attendings or consultants. Several attendings may be present in the same clinic on a given day, so linking attendings to the patients on whom they consult is difficult. The attending performance is evaluated by several factors. The supervised Senior Residents are asked to dermatology residents evaluate the attendings. Additionally, full time attendings at ZSFG work closely with t he courtesy attendings regularly and discuss and evaluate cases seen in the clinic.
