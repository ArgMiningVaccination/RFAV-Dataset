Munn Center for Nursing ResearchPATIENT CARE SERVICESAs we look back on 2003, we see examples of this dedication and teamwork throughout Patient Care Services and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)community \u2014 in simple and grand gestures alike. While we have consistently kept our patients' needs at the forefront, we also have been there to support one another \u2014 whether formally, through the CollaborativeGovernance structure that guides our practice, or informally, by supporting a colleaguefacing a life-threatening illness. Perhaps the greatest affirmation of this individual and collective dedication comes from being the first hospital in Massachusetts to be awarded Magnet HospitalRecognition from the American Nurses Association (ANA). This represents the highesthonor for nursing excellence, and in September 2003, MGH joined a limited numberof honorees worldwide. Magnet Hospital Recognition at MGH truly acknowledges the 14,000 employees hospitalwide who strive every day to offer exceptional patient care. We are fortunate to work in an environment in which the delivery of excellent patient care remains so highly valued and supported. I hope you will look back on 2003 with great personal and institutional pride as you recall the many milestones that brought us to where we are today. Every day we work together to offer our best \u2014 we give of ourselves. It is an honor and a privilege to work with the finest team of clinicians and support staff imaginable, and I thank you. With admiration, Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, MS Senior Vice President for Patient CareChief NurseDEAR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, Every day, in every moment, we remain dedicated care providers ... through-and-through. We each entered the field of health care with a desire to make a difference. And, every day we come together to do just that \u2014 at bedsides; on patient care units;in exam rooms, offices, hallways and a variety of settings \u2014 throughout the hospital, within the larger community or even onforeign soil. We consistently extend ourselves to those in need. 2 PATIENT CARE SERVICES : COMING TOGETHER On February 2003, Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, MS, senior vice president for Patient Care and chief nurse, hosted a celebratory dinner honoring the five-year anniversary of Collaborative Governance in Patient Care Services (PCS). Comprised of fourinterdisciplinary committees (Diversity, Ethics in Clinical Practice,Quality and Patient Education) and three nursing committees (Practice, Research and Staff Nurse Advisory), this communication and decision- making model has proven to be revolutionary in unleashing clinicians'ideas and energies toward ensuring that care delivery at the MGH is thebest it can be. From its inception, the Collaborative Governance committees have met once or twice per month to move their respective agendas forward. Thesecommittees interface with other decision-making groups within PatientCare Services. In addition to regular committee meetings, all committee cochairs and their respective leadership coaches meet regularly at theCommittee Leaders Meetings to share the status of their respectivecommittee's work. T ogether, the clinician cochairs chart their respectivecommittee's direction and often use this forum to negotiate for cross-committee collaboration and resources on various efforts. Committee members asked to reflect upon their experience inCollaborative Governance noted that, \"It has been a positive, enriching and exciting learning experience,\"\"I feel like I am part of the action,\" and \"There is a sense of sharing and mutual support among committee members.\" However, the true litmus test of Collaborative Governance's success is the aggregate number of outcomes from all of the committees each andevery year. These are meticulously captured in the committees' annualreports, and the outcomes are phenomenal. From the Advance Directivesinformation table sponsored by the Ethics in Clinical PracticeCommittee ... to the Nursing Image Campaign designed by the StaffNurse Advisory Committee ... to the Holiday Gift Exchange sponsoredby the Diversity Steering Committee ... to the evaluation of specialtypressure-relieving products by the Nursing Practice Committee ... to theMAKING DECISIONS TOGETHER: COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCEShowcasing MGH Patient Care Services \u2014 the many people, places, ideas and resources that make us who we are \u2014 while streamlining departmentwide communications, can be a monumental task. Last year, a steering committee set out to accomplish both of thesegoals. The fruit of its labor was unveiled inFebruary, when PCS launched a new andimproved Web site. The site was specificallydesigned to showcase care delivery, profile PCS departments and personnel, provide a platform for enhanced internal and external communications and bolster staff recruitment. Organized under eleven main headings, the content \u2014 developed by leadership and staff from individual units and departments \u2014 includes program overviews, leadership and staff profiles, and easy access to a wealth of services and resources, includingThe Center for Clinical and ProfessionalDevelopment, The Blum Patient and FamilyLearning Center, Clinical RecognitionProgram, a menu of educational offerings and upcoming events, and a database of career and employment opportunities. By the end of 2003, the Patient Care Services Web site had logged more than 137,900 visits by over 39,000 individuals. http://www.mghpcs.orgimplementation of a Journal Club by the Nursing Research Committee ... to the creation of a template and guidelines for development of online discharge education instructions by the Patient Education Committee ... to the enhancement of thePatient at Risk Program by the Quality Committee ... the work and outcomes of each of the committees individually andcollectively have had a tremendous impact on the clinicians, PCS leadership and the organization as a whole. In fact, many of these outcomes have been shared outside the walls of the MGH to regional, national and international audiences. MGH's Collaborative Governance model is indeed alive and well. This strategic process encourages and supports clinicians as they take on true ownership of the systems, practices and procedures that make MGH a professional, supportive and safe placeto achieve what each clinician comes to the MGH to do \u2014 care for patients and families.In February, the departments of Nursing and Volunteer Services introduced a pilot Pet Therapy Program to several MGH inpatient units. The program is staffed by volunteers and their pets who have completed an extensive screening and certification process.Studies increasingly show positive health outcomes associated with animal visits and interactions with pets. Pet visits help pati ents to overcome feelings of loneliness and isolation, and divert attention away from pain or discomfort. The program has been a succes s with patients and staff alike and continues to expand to additional clinical sites. PET THERAPYPATIENT CARE SERVICES WEB SITE4 PATIENT CARE SERVICES : COMING TOGETHER ACHIEVING MAGNET The crowd that had gathered in the office of Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, MS, senior vice president for Patient Care and chief nurse, was suddenly quieted by the ringing of her phone a few minutes after 11 a.m. on September 8, 2003. On the other end was Linda D. Urden, the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Magnet Recognition Commissioner. Moments later, a thumbs-up gesture by Ives Erickson acknowledged that the Massachusetts General Hospital had become the first hospital inMassachusetts to receive Magnet Hospital Recognition \u2014 the highest honor bestowed by the American Nurses Association for nursing excellence. The Magnet Hospital Recognition program grew out of an early 1980s research study that was charged with determining factors characterizing hospitals that were able to attract and retain qualified nurses despite a national shortage. These hospitals were coined \"Magnet\" hospitals. Subsequent research has linked direct nursing interventions to improved patient care. Earning Magnet Hospital Recognition was a formidable task, one that involved the entire hospital. While granted by a subsidiary of the American Nurses Association, Magnet Hospital Recognition reflects excellence in patient care throughout the entireorganization, not just Nursing. The intensive, two-pronged evaluation process first required the submission of a written volume of evidence (totaling 2,305 pages) describing MGH's compliance with certain standards and criteria. This was then followed up by an on-site visit during which MGH was observed with regards to the following nuances: collaborative practice, professional development, interdisciplinary teamwork,quality and safety initiatives, leadership, documentation and the ability to provide culturally competent care. NEW GRADUATE NURSE CRITCAL CARE PROGRAM MGH's New Graduate Nurse Critical Care Program focuses on grooming recent nursing school graduates for positions in the ICU setting. This intensive, six-month-long continuing education program affords registered nurses who have already earned their baccalaureates an extended knowledge base,further developing their nursing and decision-making skills. To date,more than 50 new graduate nurseshave been hired through theprogram into permanent staff positions in a variety of ICUs, including Burn Unit, Cardiac Surgical, Coronary Care, Medical, Neuro, Pediatrics and Surgical.Much hard work went into preparing for the Magnet review process. A steering committee and a writers group wereconvened to compile and format all the written evidence into one cohesive document. Workgroups were established to guidespecific aspects of our work. In total, 177 Magnet \"champions\" were recruited from all patient care units to help disseminatekey information. During the site visit, Magnet Hospital Recognition appraisers toured the hospital and interviewed patients, staff nurses, nurseleaders, physicians, hospital employees, administrators, trusteesand community liaisons to gain an understanding of theessence of Nursing at MGH. At a special debriefing session closing the three-day site visit, the Magnet Recognition appraisers spoke about theoverwhelming commitment they saw on the part of nurses to do what is best for patients. On Wednesday, November 12, 2003, MGH officially celebrated its recognition as the state's first Magnet hospital at a gala event, held in the lobby of the Wang Ambulatory Care Center.Attended by Partners and MGH administrators, members of the MGH Board of Trustees, staff and leadership from alldisciplines, and employees from throughout the hospital, it wasan event to remember. Ives Erickson thanked the MGHcommunity for making the Magnet journey a successful one,\"Magnet status means we are an extraordinary hospital ... itmeans we have better outcomes for our patients ... it means we foster an environment of teamwork ... it means our nurses are exceptional. Magnet status means a lot!\" RECOGNITION \u2014 TOGETHER Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, MS, senior vice president for PatientCare and chief nurse, and PeterL. Slavin, MD, MGH president,formally present the MagnetRecognition Obelisk to the MGH community at a hospitalwide celebration.6 PATIENT CARE SERVICES : COMING TOGETHER INTERNATIONAL SERVICE Iranian children found time to play amid the rubble thatonce was their home, following a 6.6 magnitudeearthquake that destroyed thecity of Bam, Iran. Photocourtesy of FEMA.As a community, we routinely extend ourselves both individually and collectively to those in distress.Recently, we have focused our attention and efforts on addressing health care disparities in our own backyards.Community health care has taken on a renewed level of importance. Culturally competent care is now a part of ourvocabulary and practice. Likewise, we have looked beyond ourborders to assist those far less fortunate than ourselves in times of both sudden and chronic need. In the winter of 2003, we came together as a nation to answer the call for help halfway around the world. On December 26,an earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale struck theancient city of Bam, Iran, causing widespread devastation \u2014at least 30,000 were left dead and more than 100,000 injured.Within hours, the Iranian government accepted the U.S. offerof humanitarian aid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) immediately mobilized our nation's International Medical- Surgical Response T eam (IMSuRT). The group is based in Boston and designed, run and sponsored by the MGH. Itscapabilities include triage, medical treatment, support for local medical staffs and preparations for patient evacuation.By seven the following morning, a team that included MGHnurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists andother personnel was ready to be deployed. They would be thefirst Americans on Iranian soil in more than twenty-five years.The Boston-based IMSuRT team arrived in Bam amid clouds of dust, piles of rubble and the remaining survivors renderedinstantly homeless. Entire neighborhoods were destroyed.Whole families perished. And, 50 percent of the city's health care workers had died. Amid the devastation, the U.S. team worked in unfamiliar surroundings where resources were scarce; they had norunning water, limited sanitation facilities and overnighttemperatures that dipped into the 20s. Aftershocks provided constant reminders of their tenuous conditions. Still, for two weeks the team treated more than 500 patients, delivered sixbabies and saved many, many lives. Beyond the exceptional care and comfort, the Americans offered something more \u2014 a sense of hope and understandingthat compassion and fellowship are all part of the humanexperience. And, for their part, the Iranian people one by one rose above the barriers of language and culture to offerexpressions of gratitude \u2014 a squeeze of the hand, bow of the head, gifts of fruit and nuts, or even a personal possession they were able to salvage from the rubble. Whether we are reminded through grand or small gestures, we witness daily that health care and humanity go hand in hand. Armed with duffle bags full of medical supplies and unlimited goodwill and determination, a team of four MGH nurses spent 11 days in January living and working in some of the poorest parts of Duran, Ecuador. Their mission was to provide free health care to area residents who lived in squalor. Crude conditions meant limited resources, so the nurses quickly learned to improvise. Through a translator, the team dedicated itself to learning about medical issues and available treatments, educating patientsand local medical personnel about various health issues, and treating residents for ailments that were often associated with their very living conditions. Upon their return to the MGH, the nurses wrote, \"The mission reminded us of how little others have and how fortunate we are to live in an abundant society. We came home with a new appreciation of our healthcare system and the resources we have on adaily basis.\"COMING TOGETHER TO HELP COUNTRIES IN NEED Members of Patient Care Services this year joined an 18-person delegation to bring goodwill, medical supplies and health education to Cuba. The trip was organized by Americans and Cubans Building Community throughExchanges, Support and Outreach (ACCESO), a nonprofit group founded by a member of the MGH community anda Massachusetts state senator. CUBACUBAECUADOR8 PATIENT CARE SERVICES : COMING TOGETHER In January, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, MD, spoke at the MGH about Healthy People 2010, a set of national objectives used by community, state and professional organizations to develop programs designed to improve health. One of the program's main goals is to eliminate health care disparitiesamong different segments of thepopulation. As a follow-up to theevent, the hospital's DiversityCommittee formed a subcommittee to examine the role the MGH couldplay in reducing racial disparities.DIVERSITYBLENDING OUR DIVERSE NEEDS AND BACKGROUNDS INTO A STRONGER WHOLE The active presence of a diverse community energizes the MGH today \u2014 evident in both our workforce and patient populations. Our sidewalks, hallways, waiting rooms and dining areas are alive with different languages,traditional dress and various customs that create a dynamic environment. As a community, we continue to deepen our understanding of what it means to deliver care that embracesthe health and well-being of all those we serve \u2014 patients,families, staff, employees and volunteers alike. Diversity remains a key component of the Patient Care Services (PCS) vision. The PCS culturally competent care curriculum offers one ongoing reminder of our commitment to community.Through its \"Introduction to Culturally Competent Care:Understanding Our Patients, Ourselves and Each Other,\" employees from throughout the hospital come together to share personal stories and situations that reveal the complexitiesof a multicultural work environment. Those who have worked at MGH for many years have an opportunity to share and learn alongside those who may still be in orientation. And, it is not unusual to have participants join us from otherinstitutions. During its four years, the program has led to adeeper understanding of cultural issues in health care and anincreasingly sophisticated level of dialogue. Likewise, the MGH Patient Care Services Diversity Steering Committee has begun to tackle the broader nationwide issue ofhealth care disparities experienced by certain populations. InSeptember, the committee sponsored a multidisciplinary disparities conference to raise awareness and paint a full pictureof the depth and breadth of this issue for the MGH community.The work of the PCS Diversity Steering Committee, senior leadership and The Center for Clinical and Professional Development laid important groundwork. The AmericanHospital Association report, \"Unequal Treatment: ConfrontingRacial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare,\" further informed that work. The report suggested many underlying causes of health care disparity that are both patient and health care system-based, including language and cultural, socioeconomic and healthdifferences, and workforce diversity. The Diversity Steering Committee continued its charge by addressing specific health care disparities throughout the year,ensuring the MGH was doing all it could to identify and addressexisting gaps in its own systems and many within the greater community. The group designed a variety of bridges, some simple and others more complex, including participating in the city's New Bostonians Community Day; examining disparitiesfrom a Social Services perspective; working with InterpreterServices to address needs and barriers specific to language;exploring the needs of people with disabilities; and activelyadvocating for health care as a civil right. It is a start \u2014 a good one. And, our attention and commitment to providing equal access to quality care remains both activeand strong.Navigating the health care system can be confusing, particularly for those who are new to the United States. In 2003, the PCS Diversity Committee teamed up with the Partners International Program to address the issue head on. Because language and a lack of vital health information prove to be enormous barriers during emergencies, the MGH team set out to create a bridge. The result: a wallet-sized \"Basic Medical Card\" designed specifically for refugee and immigrant populations. The bright yellow cards \u2014 which are designed to attract attention and be visible at night \u2014 were distributed to hundreds of foreign-born attendees at the annual New Bostonians Community Day. Sponsored by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, the event each year provides immigrants with vital information about local government and community resources. Following a free blood pressure screening, multilingual MGH volunteers helped immigrants write their results on a card that also displayed their name, preferred language, known allergies and emergency contact information. The idea caught on. Several weeks later, the Executive Director of Immigration and Refugee Services of America (IRSA), learned about the idea at a nationalrefugee conference. She wrote to the MGH commending the PCS DiversityCommittee for its \"innovative approach to addressing health care disparitiesamong Boston's foreign-born community.\"She also informed the hospital that in 2005, aspart of its work for the U.S. State Department, the agency will begin distributing these \"Basic Medical Cards\" to all newly arrived refugees throughout the United States. The department's African-American pinning ceremony has become a powerful celebration of individual and collective culture. Held each year during Black History Month, the event brings MGH community together to honor those individualswho quietly and consistently give of themselves to elevate others and, in the process, our community as a whole. CUBAPINNING CEREMONY NEW BOSTONIANS COMMUNITY DAY10 PATIENT CARE SERVICES : COMING TOGETHER We know all too well that tragedy can strike at any moment and without warning. In an instant, lives are forever changed. It is in those moments we are challenged to go beyond the ordinary in offering care and comfort to patients, their loved ones and even to one another. We become a true community. In the winter of 2003, the MGHcommunity received a stark reminder of just how powerful that calling might be. Late in the evening of February 20, hundreds had jammed into The Station nightclub in West Warwick, RI, to see the rock band Great White. Suddenly, tragedy struck as a pyrotechnics displayignited part of the stage. Fire and smoke enveloped the club within minutes. In the end, more than100 people were killed, nearly 200 suffered injuries ranging from smoke inhalation to severe burns and countless others were left to cope in the aftermath. The horror was unimaginable. As rescuers responded to the scene, the MGH received the first call: \"We need help.\" The hospital snapped into action, activating key elements of its disaster plan as health care workers in RhodeIsland began sending some of their most severely injured to the MGH. Hundreds of distraughtfriends and family members were calling and arriving at our doors, continuing a desperate searchfor their loved ones among the few unidentified survivors. True to form, the MGH community united to offer an extraordinary level of care and comfort. Individuals throughout the hospital worked tirelessly through those first crucial hours after the patients arrived. Individuals from Social Services, Nursing, Psychiatry, Chaplaincy andAdministration swiftly converted The Blum Patient and Family Learning Center into a familyresource center for those impacted by the horrific event. They painstakingly helped to identifypatients and to provide assistance and support to the frightened masses that continued to turn to MGH for hope and help.CHALLENGING TIMESThroughout 2003, countless Patient Care Services (PCS) teams came together to offersupport to a colleague or other good cause at a critical time. Some stepped in for a fellownurse who battled a serious illness. Others supported colleagues throughout family crises. And, every day \u2014 through gestures simple and even elaborate \u2014 PCS staff offered the extraordinary to our patients. The Spare Change Challenge serves as one departmentwide example of creative giving. Throughout National Physical Therapy (PT) Month, the PT Department launched a healthy competition. Therapists divided into teams to raise funds for the MGH Social Services food voucher program. By strategically placing special fundraising jars throughout the hospital, PT staff raised more than $1,000 for the MGH Social Services Department to support patients and families in need.And, as the initial shock and horror of the tragedy gave way to the harsh realities of loss and survival, the work of these dedicated care teams continued \u2014 for days, weeks andbeyond \u2014 until the last patient was finally discharged 10months later. Throughout this unimaginable event, many within the MGH community volunteered to stay beyond their shift or to cometo work on their days off. Surgical schedules were adjusted,and countless other details were quickly and thoughtfullycoordinated and readjusted, as patients' conditions changed,sometimes hour by hour.Consistently, the MGH community demonstrated an unparalleled level of talent, compassion and dedication to easing the pain of our neighbors. As Peter L. Slavin, MD,president of the MGH, observed, \"It is the tremendouscommitment of loyal and caring people that enables theMGH to stand as a beacon of hope, a place of healing,comfort and support in the midst of tragedy.\" COMING TOGETHER IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY \"WHEN IN DISTRESS, EVERY MAN BECOMES OUR NEIGHBOR.\" \u2014 Founders of the MGHSPARE CHANGE CHALLENGE 2003: THE YEAR IN REVIEW *Excludes Obstetrical UnitsMGH FACTS & FIGURES Inpatient beds 893 Admissions 44,518 Surgical procedures 32,970 Average length of stay 5.85 days Admits to observe 5,285 Occupancy 80.47% Outpatient visits 1,485,608 MGPO visits (approx.) 694,268 Clinic visits, hospital and some group 417, 203 Total health center visits 299,232 ED visits 74,905 TOTAL STAFF IN PATIENT CARE SERVICES Nursing 3,800 Chaplaincy 18 Occupational Therapy 33 Orthotics and Prosthetics 8 Physical Therapy 145 Reading Disabilities 33 Respiratory Care 92 Social Services 118 Speech-Language Pathology 24 COMBINED TOTAL 4,271As the volume of patients at MGH continues to grow, so too do the health care needs of patients.

Likewise, creati ng a supportive professional practice environment, with the appropriate balance of professional and support staff, remains a top priority and reli es heavily upon the feedback of clinicians. Each year, Patient Care Services surveys clinicians to assess a variety of organizational characteristics that are important to pro fessional practice: autonomy and control over practice; teamwork; conflict management skills; mot ivation and cultural sensitivity. In each of the past three years, MGH clinicians have reported statistically significant increases in all area s. Of note, 87 percent of Patient Care Services clinician respondents report they are satisfied or very satisfied with the professional practice environment at MGH. Within the Department of Nursing, in particular, vacancy and turnover rates remain significantly lower than Magnet Hospital, state a nd national averages, clearly indicating strong overall satisfaction among MGH nurses, even amid a growing national nursing shortage.1993 acuity average length of stay1994199519961997199819992000200120022003 average length of stay/patient acuity percent professionalreading disabilitiesrespiratory therapy very satisfied/ satisfied dissatisfied/ very dissatisfied social and prosthetics90 professional staff by departmentnursing3.5 score: range 1-4* *High scores indicate a high amount of characteristic3.375 3.25 3.125 3.0 2.875 2.75 2.6252.5organizational characteristics: patient care servicesautonomyclinician/md relationshipcultural sensitivity number 700 600500 400 300 200 100 0satisfaction with professional practice environment 2001nursing vacancy rates nursing turnover rates2001 2002 2003 20022003mghmassachusettsnational magnet percent 14 12 10 8 64 2 0nursing vacancy and turnover rates physical therapyoccupational therapycontrol over Gletter Aponte, Patient Care Associate, Obstetrics The Anthony Kirvilaitis Partnership in Caring Award Mary Artery, RN, Oncology Infusion The Marie C.

Patientsare our primary focus, and the way we deliver care reflects that focusevery day. We believe in creating a practice environment that has no barriers, is built on a spirit of inquiry, and reflects a culturally competent workforce, supportive of the patient-centered values of this institution. It is through our professional practice model that we make our vision ademonstrable truth every day byletting our thoughts, decisions andactions be guided by our values. Asclinicians, we ensure that our practiceis caring, innovative, scientific and empowering, and is based on a foundation of leadership and entrepreneurial teamwork.GUIDING PRINCIPLES The following values guide our work: We are ever alert for opportunities to improve patient care; we provide care based on the latest research findings. We recognize the importance of encouraging patients and families to participate in the decisions affecting their care. We are most effective as a team; we continually strengthen our relationships with each other and actively promote diversity within our staff. We enhance patient care and the systems supporting that care as we work with others; we eagerly enter new partnerships with people inside and outside of the Massachusetts General Hospital. We never lose sight of the needs and expectations of our patients and their families as we make clinical decisions based on the most effective use of internal and external resources. We view learning as a lifelong process, essential to the growth and development of clinicians striving to deliver quality patient care. We acknowledge that maintaining the highest standards of patient care delivery is a never-ending process that involves the patient, family, nurse, all health care providers and the community at large. STRATEGIC GOALS We lead the industry in providing patient- and family-centered care. We partner with the community to better understand the health care needs of the diverse population of patients we serve, and to establish a shared vision of care and services. We are the health care industry leader for quality and safety. We develop and advance systems, technology and programs to promote individualized patient care and support those who provide care. We are the \"employer of choice\" for all professions and support staff, and we value diversity in our workforce. We work to promote and support the institution in realizing sound financial growth. We position nurses, therapists, social workers, medication interpreters, chaplains and support staff within the hospital to have a strong voice in issues impacting patient care. We continuously create throughput systems and processes that drive delivery of safe, efficient, timely and patient centered care . We provide excellent leadership, and we foster leadership growth opportunities.Carolyn Anderson, RN Cardiac Surgical Critical Care and Step Down Christine Donahue Annese, RN, MSN Central Resource Team, Clinical Supervisors and IV Therapy Cristina Bethune, RN Electrophysiology Lab Sharon Bouvier, Barbara J.
