Vol. 03-1Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of a rulemaking activity through the Ida ho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rulemaking activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 02-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2002, Bulletin 02-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2002, etc. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to th e months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. -1 refers to January; Volume No. -2 refers to February; and so forth. Ex ample: The Bulletin published in January of 2003 is cited as Volume 03-1, the December 2002 Bulletin is cited as Vo lume 02-12. The March 2001 Bulletin is cited as Volume 01-3. RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been adopted and approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Index of Administrative Rulemaking , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process co mprises five distinct activities; Negotiated, Proposed, Temporary, Pending, and Final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings consist of all five. At a minimum a rulemaking includes proposed, pending, and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when meeting required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate concensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 11 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all inte rested parties and the agency seek a consensus on the content of the rule. Agencies are encour aged to proceed through this informal rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of the text in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should lead the rulemaking to the temporary and/or proposed rule stage. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency in which the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Bulletin. Th e notice of proposed rulemaking must include: a) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction with a temporary rule docket. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to pro ceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular session of the legislature unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as that of the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a temporary/proposed rule. State law requires that the text of a proposed or temporary rule be IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 12 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1published in the Administrative Bulletin. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect if the rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the Notice of Pending Rule. This includes: a) the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; and d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the Notice of Pending Rule is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and is in effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that the agency has violated the legisl ative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution will be adopted rejecting, amending, or modifying the rule or any part thereof. A Notice of Final Rule must be published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made.

HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAP A\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAP A number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.060.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration. \"05.\" refers to Title 05 which is the Department of Administration' s Division of Purchasing. \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\". \"060.\" refers to Major Section 060, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\". \"02.\" refers to Subsection 060. 02. \"c.\" refers 060.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subparagraph 060.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 14 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER\". The \"Docket Number\" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0101). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAP A designation (e.g. the two-digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0101\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" (Chapter 01). \"0101\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket subm itted and published during the year; in this case the first rulemaking action of the chapter published in calendar year 2001. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)\" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows : \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" It may also be cited to include the IDAP A, Title, and Chapter number also, as the TITLE number of the agency rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the agency rule. \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that is being cited. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAP A, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, 'Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.'\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 15 January 1, 2003 -

The consumption of alcohol on the job is prohibite d. Employees may not work if their performance is impaired by the use of alcohol; 2. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited, and if occurring on state property or during an employee's hours of work, demands immediate corrective action; 3. Each state agency shall provide em ployees with information on Idaho' s Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Policy, as well as information on the state's Employee Assistance Plan; 4. Violations of the Idaho Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Policy will be cause for management/supervisor intervention and may result in referr al to treatment, including partic ipation in the Employee Assistance Program. It shall be the policy of the State of Ida ho to direct its efforts toward rehabilitation whenever reasonable; 5. Any intervention steps taken upon a violation of the Idaho Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Policy must be consistent with all due process requirements and other constitutional rights of state employees; 6. The privacy rights of employees ar e important.

The director of each agency shall report quarterly, th e first of January, April, July, and October, to the Division of Human Resources any violations of the Idaho Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Policy and the corrective actions taken. \"Quarterly\" means the report shall be filed the first day of January, April, July, and October. The report shall, to the extent practicable, protect the confidentiality of the employee involved, but shall describe the nature of the employee's position; 8. The Division of Human Resources shall annually compile information regarding violations of this policy and the corrective actions taken, and report this information by June 30 to the Governor. Any information so reported shall be reported in a manner to avoid revealing the identity of the employees involved. The Division of Human Resources, when it compiles this data, shall do so by type of position so as to determine whether there is an alcohol or drug problem in any \"safety-sensitive\" positions; 9. Whenever there is an alcohol or drug problem in a \"safety-sensitive\" position, it is critical that the problem be addressed aggressively. For the purpose of this policy, a \"safety-sensitive\" position is one in which: a. The duties involve a greater-than-normal level of trust for, responsibility for, or impact on the health and safety of the employee or others; and b. Errors in judgment, inattentiveness or diminished coordination, dexterity, or composure while performing the duties could clearly result in mistakes that would endanger the health and safety of the employee or others; and c. Employees in these positions work with such independence that it cannot be safely assumed that mistakes such as those described in subsection (b) could be prevented by a supervisor or anotheremployee; 10. In the event the Division of Human Resources fin ds an alcohol or drug problem in any agency or classification, it shall report that to the Governor, and the agency, working in conjunction with the Division of Human Resources and the Governor, shall develop a prog ram to respond to the problem. This program may include alcohol or drug testing for employees in safety-sensitive classifications where such a problem has been documented; 11. All state agencies responsible to the Governor are directed, and all other public entities are requested, to assist the Division of Human Resources in discharging its responsibilities under this order; 12. Nothing in this order shall be deemed to abrogate any existing policy or directive relating to alcohol or drug use by state employees or to affect any existing or future state employee disciplinary proceeding; and 13. Where federal laws or regulations require the state to implement more stringent regulations than those contained in this policy, those federal regulations and procedures supersede and/or augment this policy. This Executive Order shall cease to be effec tive four years after its entry into force.

If the Department determines that a facility is operationally or financially unstable, is located in an under-served area, or addresses an under-served need, the Department may negotia te a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in effect for that facility. (4-5-00) 308 9. INTERIM ADJUSTMENTS TO RATES AS A RESULT OF NEW MANDATES. Certain costs may be excluded from the cost limit calculations, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rates as provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: (4-5-00) 01. Changes Of More Than Fifty Cents Per Patient Day In Costs . Changes of more than fifty cents ($.50) per patient day in costs otherwise subject to the cost limitations incurred by a facility as a result of changes in state or federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cost report until such time as they can be properly reflected in the cost limits. (4-5-00) a. The provider shall report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified and reconciled to the provider's general ledger. These costs will be reported separately and will not be reimbursed through the rate setting process until the costs are fully represented in the cost data used to establish the cost limitations and rates. (4-5-00) b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule changes, the costs from each event are to be reported separately. (4-5-00) c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department states otherwise. (4-5-00) 02. Interim Rate Adjustments . For interim rate purposes, the provider may be granted an increase in its prospective rate to cover such cost increases. A cost statement covering a recent period may be required with justification for the increased costs. The actual amount relate d to such increases will be determined at audit and may be retrospectively settled. (4-5-00) 03. Future Treatment Of Costs . After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were first required, the Department will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded costs related to those increases in the calculation of costs subject to the cost center limits. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cost limits until these costs are able to be fully and equitabl y incorporated into the data base used to project the cost limits. When cost increases which have been excluded from the cap are incorporated in the inflation indices used to set the cost limits, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclude the influence of such changes if the amount included in the index is identified. When the cost limits are set to include previously excluded am ounts, any adjustments made to the indices related to the previously excluded costs will be removed. (4-5-00) 309 10. MDS REVIEWS. The following Minimum Data Set (MDS) reviews will be conducted: (4-5-00) (8-1-02)T 01. Facility Review . Subsequent to the picture date, each facility will be sent a copy of its resident roster (a listing of residents, their RUG classification, cas e mix index, and identification as Medicaid or other). It will be the facility's responsibility at that time to review the roster for accuracy. If the roster is accurate, the facility will sign and return the roster for rate setting. If any errors are detected, those errors will be communicated to the Department in writing along with any supporting documentation. If the signed resident roster is not returned and no errors are communicated to the Department, the original resident roster will be used for rate setting. Once the resident DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0301 Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho Temporary and Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 97 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1roster has been used for rate setting, it will be considered final unless modified by subsequent Departmental review. (4-5-00) 02. Departmental Review . If a departmental review of the MDS data reveals errors that result in an incorrect case mix index, the provider's rate will be retro actively adjusted, for all quarte rs containing the incorrect assessment, and an amount due to or from the Department will be calculated. This does not include residents who received the default classification due to incomplete or inconsistent MDS data. (4-5-00) 310 1. SPECIAL RATES. Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides authority for the Director to pay facilities a special rate for care given to patients who have long term care needs beyond the normal scope of facility services. These patients must have needs which are not adequately reflected in the rates calculated purs uant to the principles set forth in Section 56-102, Idaho Code. The payment for such specialized care will be in addition to any payments made in accordance with other provisions of this chapter. The incremental cost to a facility that exceeds the rate for services provided pursuant to the provisions of this section will be excluded from the computation of payments or rates under other provisions of Section 56-102, Idaho Code, and these rules. (4-5-00) 01. Determinations . A determination to approve or not approve a special rate will be made on a patient-by-patient basis. No rate will be allowed if reimbursement for these needs is available from a non-Medicaid source. A special rate request will be for an expected condition that will be on-going for a period of greater than two (2) weeks. (4-5-00) 02. Application . Until the facility applies for a special rate, patients with such needs will be included in the computation of the facility's rates following the principles described in Section 56-102, Idaho Code. (4-5-00) 03. Approval . Approved special rates will become effective on the date the application is received, but no earlier than the first day of the month in which th e application for a special rate was received. (4-5-00) 04. Reporting . Costs equivalent to payments at the special rate will be removed from the cost components subject to limits, and will be reported separately. (4-5-00) 05. Limitation . The reimbursement rate paid will not exceed the provider's charges to other patients for similar services. (4-5-00) 06. Prospective Rate Treatment . Prospective treatment of special ra tes became effective July 1, 2000. Subsections 31 0 1.07 through 31 01.09 of these rules provide clarification of how special rates will be handled under the prospective payment system. (3-15-02) (8-1-02)T 07. Residents Qualifying . Special rates are intended for resi dents who have long term care needs beyond the normal scope of facility services, and whose needs are not adequately reflected in the rates set pursuant to Section 56-102, Idaho Code. (3-15-02) 08. Determination Of Payment For Qualifying Residents . Special rates shall be reimbursed in one (1) of the methods described in Subsections 31 01.08.a. through 31 01.08.d. of these rules. (7-1-02)T (8-1-02)T a. Special Rate Units. If a facility operates a special rate unit; i.e., behavioral unit, or a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) unit, etc., the following reimbursemen t methods will apply under the circumstances described Subsections 31 01.08.a.i. through 31 01.08.a.vi. of these rules. (7-1-02)T (8-1-02)T i. Facility is Under the Direct Care Limit - If the facility operates a special rate unit, the costs of which do not exceed the direct care limit, with all direct car e costs included in the rate calculation, no special rate shall be paid for the unit. (3-15-02) ii. Facility is Over the Direct Care Limit - If the facility operates a special rate unit, the costs of which exceed the direct care limit, with all direct care costs included in the rate calculation, the special rate for the unit will be equal to the lesser of the per diem amount by which di rect care costs exceed the limit, or the special rate add-on calculated as follows: each Medicaid resident approved fo r a special rate is classified using Medicare's grouper DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0301 Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho Temporary and Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 98 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1(currently RUG's III v.5.12 44 Group) and is assigned a tota l rate equal to the applicable Medicare price that would be paid if the resident were Medicare eligible. The special rate \"add-on\" to the facility rate is calculated by subtracting the resident-specific Medicaid rate (bas ed on each resident's Medicaid CMI) fro m the Medicare price. The average of the special rate add-on amounts calculated using this meth odology shall be compared to the amount the provider is over the limit. The lesser amount is allowed as a special rate. (3-15-02) iii. New Unit Added before July 1, 2000 - A unit added before July 1, 2000 that does not have sufficient historical cost data in the cost report used to se t the rate shall receive the same rate that would have been set under the retrospective system until a cost report with sufficient cost detail is filed. (3-15-02) iv. New Unit Added after July 1, 2000 - To qualify for special rates, new units, or increases to the number of licensed beds in an existing unit must first receive Departmental approval. Since a new unit will not have the cost history of an existing unit, the provider's relationship to the cap will not be considered in qualifying for a special rate. Those residents who are appr oved for special rates will have their special rate calculated as the difference between the applicable Medicare price under PPS, and the Me dicaid rate for that individual resident as explained in Section 31 01.08.a.ii. of these rules. However, the amount would not be limited to the amount the provider is over the limit, as the costs of the unit are not in the rate calculation. (3-15-02) (8-1-02)T v. One Hundred Percent (100%) Special Care Facility in Existence as of July 1, 2000 - If at July 1, 2000 an entire facility is devoted to caring for \"special rate\" residents, including Medicaid residents approved for special rates as well as private pay and other residents who would qualify for special rates if they were Medicaid eligible, the facility's allowable reimbursement will be cal culated as follows. The costs of the direct care component will not be subject to the cost limit. However, those costs will still be case-mix adjusted based on the ratio of the Medicaid case-mix to the facility-wide case-mix index. (3-15-02) vi. Customary Charge - If the cost to operate a special rate unit is being included in a facility's rate calculation process, the facility must report its usual and customary charge for that unit on the quarterly reporting form. A weighted customary charge shall be computed by taking the number of Medicaid days approved for special rates times the usual and customary charge for private pay individuals in that unit, plus the Medicaid days not in the special rate unit times the usual and customary charge for that portion of the facility. (3-15-02) b. Equipment/Non-Therapy Supplies. Equipment and non-therapy supplies not adequately addressed in the current RUG's system shall be reimbursed at invoice cost as an add-on to the facility's rate for the resident receiving the equipment or supplies. The facility need not exceed the direct care limit to receive a special rate for such services. Items that qualify for such treatment include but are not limited to the following: air fluidized beds, overlay mattresses, TPN supplies and V AC wound care. (3-15-02) c. Ventilator Dependent Residents and Residents Receiving Tracheotomy Care. In the case of ventilator dependent and tracheotomy residents, a two (2) st ep approach shall be taken to establish the special rate. The facility need not exceed the direct care limit to receive a special rate for ventilator care and tracheotomy care. The first step is the calculation of a staffing add-on for the cost, if any, of additional direct care staff required to meet the exceptional needs of these residents. The add-on shall be calculated following the provisions set forth in Subsection 31 0 1.08.d. of these rules. The second step shall be an equipment, supply, or both add-on to be added to the rate up to the invoice cost or rental amount. The combined amount of these two (2) components shall be considered the special rate. (7-1-02)T (8-1-02)T d. Residents Who Do Not Reside in a Special Rate Unit Requiring One-to-One Staffing Ratios. Facilities that do not have established units with a cost history built into their cost reports and rates may at times have residents who require unusual levels of staffing; such as, one-to-one staffing ratios. If the resident qualifies for a special rate, the additional reimbursement will be allowed as follows: Example Using Sixteen (16) Hours of One-To-One Care Total hours per day: 24.0 Less minimum staff level required: (2.0)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0301 Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho Temporary and Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 99 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1(3-15-02) e. For differing levels of one-to-one care; i.e., eight (8) hours or twenty-four (24) hours, only the total hours of one-to-one care approved would be changed in Subsection 31 01.08.d. The WAHR CNA wage rate as described in IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Rules Governing the Medical Assistance Program ,\" Section 148 will be updated prior to the July 1st rate setting each year. Should the WAHRS survey be discontinued, prior amounts may be indexed forward, or a comparable survey may be conducted. (3-15-02 )(8-1-02)T 09. Treatment Of The Special Rate Cost For Future Rate Setting Periods . Special rates shall be established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facility rate. When a cost report is used to set a prospective rate contains special rate cost, an adju stment shall be made to \"offset\", or re move, the amount received for the special rates from the calculation of costs. The amount received shall be calculated by multiplying the special rate paid for each qualifying resident by the number of days that were paid. The case-mix index for each resident shall be left in the facility-wide average and the Medicaid average for rate setting purposes, as the offset would only be for the incremental portion of the rate, above what Medicaid would have paid. (3-15-02) 311 2. PHASE-IN PROVISIONS. The rates established pursuant to these rules shall be ph ased in over a three-year period as follows: (4-5-00) 01. July 1, 1999 Through June 30, 2000 . During this period, providers will continue to be reimbursed under the previous retrospective system; however, the Department will also issue by January 1, 2000 \"shadow rates\" which will inform facilities what their rate would be under the provisions of these rules. (4-5-00) 02. July 1, 2000 Through December 31, 2000 . Rates calculated under the provisions of these rules will be compared to the rates that were available to the same facility as of June 30, 1999. Facilities which would experience decreases in their rate of one dollar ($1) or less per resident day will receive the rate established under the provisions of these rules with no phase-in. Facilities whic h would experience decreases in their rate of greater than one dollar ($1) per resident day will have the decrease in their rate limited to the greater of one dollar ($1) per resident day or twenty-five percent (25%) of the decrease. Facilities which would experience increases in their reimbursement rate will receive the increased rate. (4-5-00) 03. January 1, 2001, Through June 30, 2001 . Rates calculated under the provisions of these rules will be compared to the rates that were available to the same facility as of June 30, 1999. Facilities which would experience decreases in their rate of two dollars ($2) or less per resident day will receive the rate established under the provisions of these rules with no phase-in. Facilities whic h would experience decreases in their rate of greater than two dollars ($2) per resident day will have the decrease in their rate limited to the greater of two dollars ($2) per Net special rate hours allowed: 22.0 Average wage rate of CNA's per WAHR survey: $7.53 Plus Benefits at Thirty percent (30%): $2.26 Allowed wages and Benefits $9.79 Allowable daily special rate add-on: $215.38 Divided by total hours: 24.0 Calculated hourly rate: $8.97 One to one hours approved: 16.0 Sixteen (16) hours of one to one add-on: $143.53Example Using Sixteen (16) Hours of One-To-One CareDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0301 Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho Temporary and Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 100 January 1, 2003 - Vol. 03-1resident day or fifty percent (50%) of the decrease. Facilities which would experience increases in their reimbursement rate will receive the increased rate. (4-5-00) 04. July 1, 2001 . Beginning with July 1, 2001, the rates established under the provisions of these rules will be fully implemented with no phase-in. (4-5-00) 3123. OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. The Director will appoint an oversight committee to monitor implementation of the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for nursing facility reimbursement that takes effect July 1, 1999. The committee will be made up of at least one (1) member representing each of the following organizations: the Department, the state association(s) representing free standing skilled care facilities, and the state association(s) representing hospital-based skilled care facilities. The committee will continue to meet periodically subsequent to the implementation of the PPS. After three (3) years of implementation, the committee will examin e the inflation factors used to inflate costs forward for rate setting (DRI + one percent (+1%), the inflation factors used in limiting the growth in the cost component limitations (DRI + two percent (+2%), and the level of the minimum cost component limitations (not lower than limits established July 1, 1999). (4-5-00) 313 4.D I S P U T E S . 01. Administrative Review Requirement . If any facility wishes to contest the way in which a rule or contract provision relating to the prospective, cost-related reimbursement system was applied to such facility by the Director, it shall first pursue the administrative review pro cess set forth in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16, Title 05, Chapter 03, Section 300, et seq., and Section 301, \"Rules Governing Contested Case s Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings\".

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-2007, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING: Public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later that January 31, 2003. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Commission has decided to permit licensees to \"self-cer tify\" their CE compliance when renewing or reactivating a license. To be effective, of course, th e certification is subject to verification. The Commission believes that allowing the licensee to self-certify his completion of the CE requ irements - rather than submit a hefty packet of documents with the application - is a benefit to the licensee as well as the Commission. The Rules set forth the type of CE documentation the licensee will need to keep, and authorize the Commission to request the documentation in order to verify the certificate of compliance. The rules also provide that the license will be inactivated if he fails to comply with the Commission' s request for verification, and restate for the licensee the consequences of submitting a false certificate (which already exist by statute). Finally, the rules list the \"approved CE topics,\" which had previously only been listed in Policy. The standards set fo rth in these rules are deemed necessary by the Commission to allow it to continue this much-desired self-certification program.
