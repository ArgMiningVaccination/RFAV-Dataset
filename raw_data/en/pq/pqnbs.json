What COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is and what it is used for COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is a vaccine used for active immunisation to prevent COVID19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years. The vaccine triggers the body's natural production of antibodies and stimulates immune cells to protect against COVID-19 disease. 2. What you need to know before you receive COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be given - if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, [listed in section 6](#ingredients). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. Contact your doctor or healthcare professional immediately or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have an allergic reaction. It can be life-threatening. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if you have: - ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in the past. - you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection. - a severe illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper airway infection, like a cold, are not reasons to delay vaccination. - a weakened immune system, such as due to HIV infection, or are on a medicine that affects your immune system - a bleeding problem, bruise easily or use a medicine to inhibit blood clotting There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 may not fully protect all those who receive it. No data are currently available in individuals with a weakened immune system or who are taking chronic treatment that suppresses or prevents immune responses. If you are immunocompromised and receive an additional dose of mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, it may still not provide full immunity to COVID-19 and you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. Children COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended for children under 12 years. Other medicines and COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. Driving and using machines COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4 'Possible side effects' may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or operate machinery until you are sure that you are not affected.

Most side effects are mild or moderate and go away within a few days of appearing.

If your fever is high and lasts longer than three days, or you have other persistent symptoms, this might not be due to side effects of the vaccine and you should seek appropriate medical advice according to your symptoms. Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. If you are concerned about a side-effect it can be reported directly via the [Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?e). When completing a report please include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available. Alternatively, side effects of concern in association with Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT 162b2 can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information on 01304 616161 or via [Pfizer Safety Reporting](www.pfizersafetyreporting.com). Please do not report the same side effect(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and MHRA (in an anonymized form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this vaccine. 5.
