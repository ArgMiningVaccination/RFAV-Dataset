Although there appears tobenofirm correlative evidence linking residue concentrations inmarine mammals withreproductive effects, there isenough concern about possible links tojustify more experimental studies, with theaimofidentifying thepossible biochemical mechanisms involved. foridentifying discrete populations ofmarine mammals thatoverlap ingeographic distribution. However, many factors unrelated togeographical distribution may affect thechemical burden of individual animals orofentire population components evenwithin ahomogeneously distributed population.
