There is a growing body of research examining factors that influence parents' vaccine intentions. The current study investigated factors that would influence maternal intent to vaccinate their children for COVID-19, shortly before the CDC approved vaccines for children 11 and younger. We had a sample of n = 176 mothers (Mchildage = 71.63 months, 52% White) from California fill out an online survey during February-April 2021. Our results suggest that perceived COVID-19 threat predicts mothers' intention to vaccinate their children (b = 0.370, p < 0.001), controlling for mothers' age, socioeconomic status, race, and child age. Child age (b = 0.027, p = 0.008), SES (b = 0.396, p = 0.018), and child previous flu shot (b = 0.725, p < 0.001) also positively predicted mothers' intention to vaccinate their children. Results are discussed in light of prior research on maternal vaccine intentions and hesitancy.", "sitename": "AIMS Public Health", "date": "2022-10-22", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || World Health OrganizationOrigin of SARS-CoV-2 (2020).
