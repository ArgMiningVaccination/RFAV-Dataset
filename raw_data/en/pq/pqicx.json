Every week around \u00a31 billion worth of retailgoods are sold in the United Kingdom on the basis of the measurement of theirquantity 1. Consumers need to be confident that they receive the quantity of goods they have paid for. And businesses need to be confident that they aretrading in a fair marketplace 2. 2 To provide consumer protection and a fair marketplace the Government has established a system for regulating units of measurement; the design and useof weighing and measuring equipment, and the sale of goods by quantity (seeexamples at Figure 1 ). The legislation, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, is made under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and toimplement European Community Directives. Regulating weights andmeasures for use in trade also ensures that competitive advantage is notgained purely through measurement systems in use; and improves overseascompetitiveness by ensuring companies conform to internationalmeasurement and calibration standards. Examples of short weight sales 1 Gainsborough Coal Merchant The coal merchant was found by Lincolnshire County Council Trading StandardsOfficers to be using a 25 kilogram weight to weigh coal bags which actuallyweighed only 23.5 kilograms. The weight had been drilled in the bottom andfilled with expanding foam. For this, and for having a large number of shortweight bags of coal and two incorrect weighing machines, the merchant wasprosecuted and ordered to pay \u00a32,320 in fines and costs. Building Supplies Company: Short Weight Sand A customer complained to Northamptonshire County Council Trading StandardsDepartment about having paid for five tonnes of sand but only receiving anamount which was 16 per cent underweight. Two test purchases by TradingStandards Officers of four tonnes were found to be 8.5 per cent and 11 per centunderweight. The company was also using equipment not suitable for measuringfor the purposes of trade. It was prosecuted and ordered to pay \u00a38,166 in finesand costs. The company director was fined \u00a31,800.

The legislation is intended to ensure that definedstandards apply to weights and measures used for trade across the country.Enforcement of the legislation falls to the Laboratory in matters relating to thedesign of weighing and measuring equipment and to over 200 local authorityTrading Standards Departments in matters relating to all other aspects. Thisreport examines the extent to which: !the Department has been able to identify the significant risks faced byconsumers or businesses with regard to weights or measures used for trade; !the legislation addresses those risks; and !the Department can monitor how effectively weights and measureslegislation is enforced. Identifying and assessing the significant risks to consumers and businesses 4 Inaccurate weighing and measuring equipment or the consequent sale of goods sold under weight may have only a small effect at the level of individualtransactions, but the overall effect across the economy can be considerable. Forexample, not providing full liquid measures of draught beer and cider allowslicensees to sell an estimated 200 million more 'pints' a year than they buy in, atan estimated value of about \u00a3130 million at wholesale prices. And, in 2000-01,an estimated 94,700 (five per cent) of the over two million items of equipmentinspected in service by Trading Standards Officers were found to be inaccurate.The Department's assessment of risks to fair trading is split between two unitswith responsibilities for overseeing different aspects of the legislation.Legislation on transactions in goods by weight or measure are overseen by theDepartment's Consumer and Competition Policy Directorate (the Directorate). 2executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES3executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Those relating to weighing and measuring equipment for use for trade fall within the remit of the Laboratory. Although no documented overview of risksacross the range of weights and measures legislation has been maintained, theDirectorate and the Laboratory maintain formal and informal links betweenthemselves and local authorities to exchange information on relevant issues. 5 The Directorate maintains contact with consumer and commercial interests through formal and informal means, including consulting on specific issuessuch as protecting the consumer against being served draught beer and cider inshort measure. Weights and measures research can be funded from theDirectorate's overall research budget. Although such funding has to competewith other research needs, which raises the possibility that not all weights andmeasures research may be done in a timely fashion, there has, to date, beensufficient funding available to meet identified research needs in the weights andmeasures area over the last five years. This research has often taken account ofissues raised by interested parties outside the Department, such as consumercomplaints and local authorities, or by developments at the EuropeanCommunity level. To date, three studies into testing net drained weight offoodstuffs and five studies into the use consumers make of quantity informationhave been carried out. 6 The Laboratory has a well-established programme of research with which to address issues relevant to the regulation of equipment, which allows it toidentify and assess new and changing risks arising from technical aspects ofweights and measures. The Legal Metrology 3Programme is run as part of the Department's National Measurement System. The current Programme, for theperiod 2002-05, has a budget of \u00a37.4 million, of which about \u00a32 million ismost directly relevant to the identification and assessment of risks. Progress ismeasured with reference to task milestones although, before 2002-03, theseonly covered a third of the Programme's value. The extent to which theoutcomes and achievements meet the Programme's objectives are not formallyassessed in a way which allows success to be rated for each three-yearprogramme and comparisons to be made between successive programmes.Achievement of task milestones will not, in itself, guarantee achievement of theProgramme's objectives. 7 Trading Standards Departments are required to provide the Department with statutory annual returns containing information on weights and measuresenforcement activity; the results of that activity; and the nature of anyinfringements identified. Information such as this is useful for identifyingchanges in the level and nature of enforcement and non-compliance, and anyrisks to consumer protection and fair trading these may represent. For the years1990-91 to 1993-94, the Department undertook annual exercises to identifythe level of weights and measures inspections carried out by Trading StandardsDepartments. In 2000, the Laboratory used available returns to try and establisha clearer picture of the state of local weights and measures work, but dataquality problems led to no conclusions being drawn. And for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02, inspection levels were again analysed as part of workdone to draft the Regulatory Reform Order on weights and measures due tocome into force in 2004 (see paragraph 9). But no regular analysis of trends inthe level of local weights and measures activity, or the results of that activity,has been carried out by the Department. Nor has it provided routine feedbackto Trading Standards Departments on the information collected. In recent years,few authorities have provided this information on a regular basis. For the threeyears 1998-99 to 2000-01, only 61 (31 per cent) of the 198 Trading StandardsDepartments provided the Department with a return each year. 3 'Legal metrology' focuses on the need for confidence and equity in measurements which directly concern the public, especially those measurements relating to efficiency in trade, public health andsafety, and environmental monitoring. The National Audit Office report focuses on those aspectsrelevant to trade.4executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 8 The legislation largely covers longstanding risks to achieving accurate, fair and legal weights and measures, and address blatant attempts to deliver shortweight. They have been updated to a degree to reflect the impact of technologyon the accuracy and reliability of weights and measures, for example, theinherent errors in automated packing systems. But the main body of legislationhas become increasingly out of date, with much of the Weights and MeasuresAct 1985 being a consolidation of the Weights and Measures Acts of 1963,1976 and 1979. The legislation has also become an increasingly complexcombination of European obligations and domestic legislation. For example,goods which were only sold wholesale in the past, and not covered by thelegislation, can now be bought retail in the same quantities (for example, Do-It-Yourself products) but remain outside the legislation. And the thresholdsbelow which quantity information is not required to be provided differsdepending on the product. The 1999 Consumer White Paper recognised thatthe age and complexity of the legislation 'confuses businesses and...consumers who have little, if any, idea of what they should see' 4. This is particularly the case for new businesses who can find understanding theamount of legislation especially burdensome. 9 The Laboratory has carried out a programme of updating the technical aspects of the legislation since 1985 through work carried out as part of the LegalMetrology Programme. More generally, the Department has recognised theneed to update and simplify the legislation, but progress has been slow.Consultations which started in 1999 on the general principles for simplifyingand clarifying the law on the sale of goods by quantity had, at the time of theNational Audit Office examination, not led to changes in the legislation. Thiswas initially due to the lack of Parliamentary time for primary legislation. Andconsultations begun in late 2000 on a specific aspect of weights and measureslegislation to improve consumer protection against draught beer and ciderbeing served in short measure have made slow progress because theDepartment has not been able to achieve a consensus between trade andconsumer groups and Trading Standards Departments on the best way forward.Alongside this exercise, the Department was engaged in a broader programmeto overhaul the consumer provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973 through theEnterprise Act 2002. This and the work underway on consumer credit tookpriority for legislative resources in this area. On broader weights and measuresreform, the main changes needed, as they relate to packaged goods, will bemade by a Regulatory Reform Order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001and a consolidated food order under the Weights and Measures Act 1985. Bothare expected to come into force in 2004, following public consultation laterthis year. Consultations on improving the law relating to weighing andmeasuring equipment have been delayed awaiting the implementation ofrelated European legislation, which is itself not expected to come into forceuntil 2005 at the earliest. 10 S ome aspects of weights and measures law have been deregulated to reduce cost burdens on industry. Since 19805, manufacturers of non-automatic weighing machines (for example, shop counter scales) have been able toobtain a single design approval which is valid throughout the EuropeanCommunity instead of the separate approvals previously needed in eachMember State. And from 1999 6, manufacturers, installers and repairers of weighing and measuring equipment covered by Section 11 of the Weights andMeasures Act 1985 have been allowed to 'self-verify' that equipment installedfor use conforms with the approved design, rather than such checks beingmade by a Trading Standards Officer. 4 Department of Trade and Industry (1999), Modern Markets: Confident Consumers, paragraph 6.11. 5 The Measuring Instruments (EEC Requirements) (Amendment No.3) Regulations 1979 (SI1979/1459).6 The Deregulation (Weights and Measures) Order 1999, SI 1999/503.5executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Monitoring the enforcement of weights and measures legislation 11 New types of weighing and measuring equipment must receive 'type approval', normally from the Laboratory, before manufacturers can put them on themarket. The Laboratory carries out most such work in the United Kingdom. TheLaboratory does not collate information on instances of equipment found in usefor which a type approval certificate does not exist, although it told theNational Audit Office that such breaches were rare. The Laboratory has carriedout limited investigations into the degree of conformity of installed equipmentwith the approved designs for such equipment but, again, does not collateregularly instances of non-conformity. Such information would be useful inidentifying the extent to which installed equipment was bypassing theregulatory framework. 12 The Department is responsible for ensuring that the legislation is enforceable, but relies on local authority Trading Standards Departments to actually enforcethe legislation governing the installation and use of weighing and measuringequipment and of the use of quantity information for the sale of goods, forwhich they have certain legal duties. This is one of a wide range ofresponsibilities Trading Standards Departments have who, typically, can beresponsible for enforcing the requirements of over 80 Acts of Parliament, plusmany more pieces of subordinate legislation. The Office of the Deputy PrimeMinister in England, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh AssemblyGovernment have the lead within Government for developing a consistentapproach to the improvement of local services generally. Within thisframework, the Department oversees the weights and measures regulatoryregime and relies on local enforcement to ensure that the regime contributes toachieving defined standards of consumer protection and fair trading, whilstrecognising that variations in the level and nature of enforcement will existbetween Trading Standards Departments to reflect local priorities. 13 The National Audit Office examined whether there were significant variations in the scale and results of enforcement work between Trading StandardsDepartments. The National Audit Office found that voluntary guidelines,applicable at the time, set by local government on the frequency with whichbusiness premises should be inspected, based on different levels of risk 7, were not being fully applied. Under the guidance, high risk businesses shouldreceive an annual visit, subject to local discretion to reflect other enforcementactions such as education and awareness campaigns. In 2000-01, on average,only 56 per cent of high risk businesses 8were visited by Trading Standards Departments. The lack of legal powers available to the Department to enable itto set minimum levels of inspection has meant it has not considered itappropriate to check that inspections have been carried out to therecommended frequencies. 7 The Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services guidance recommends that high risk businesses should be inspected annually, medium risk businesses once every two years, and low riskbusinesses once every five years. 8 These are premises assessed as high risk for all purposes not just in relation to weights and measures. The risk rating does not always reflect the metrological risk. For example, a landfill site may have a low overall risk from a consumers point of view, but represent a high metrological risk because the weighbridge used to weigh incoming fill materials (as a basis for tax collection) could be subject to adverse environmental conditions.\"Every review of weights and measures has identified a lack ofdata and information on the national picture as a substantial problem when it comes to planning and securing resources.\" DTI Legal Metrology Programme 2002-056executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 14 Wide variations also exist in the average error rates found by different types of local authority (Figure 2) . The Department is unable to say whether such differences are legitimate or not, in part because of a lack of regular analysis ofthe annual statutory returns from Trading Standards Departments (see paragraph7 above) and the growing incompleteness of its database. The Department doesnot know whether the differences in the proportion of products inspectedwhich were found to be inaccurate was due to greater vigilance on the part ofsome Trading Standards Departments; or due to more effective prevention andeducation programmes. 15 The Department has powers to inspect local authorities for the purpose of gathering information about arrangements for enforcing weights and measureslegislation, but these powers were last used in 1964. This may be because therewas no cause to use them. But recent studies by the Audit Commission 9and Accounts Commission10have highlighted major variations in the levels and types of service provided by Trading Standards Departments, that suggest therewould have been grounds for inspecting local arrangements in the interests ofmaintaining consistency nationally. However, these powers do not allow theDepartment to intervene to address cases of poor performance. Since 1999,local authority trading standards work, including weights and measuresenforcement, has been covered by the Best Value inspection regime whichincludes powers to allow the appropriate Secretary of State to intervene wherelocal authorities fail to provide best value. Any decision to intervene, however,must be based on an authority's performance against one or more Best Valueperformance indicators. Trading Standards work is covered by a single indicatorwhich is now recognised as being inadequate for the purposes of identifying 9 Audit Commission (1999), Measure for Measure: the best value agenda for trading standards services, London. 10 Accounts Commission (2002), Made to measure?

In the absence of an appropriate indicator, regular Departmental analysis of the statutory returns itreceives from local authorities could have helped to identify authorities wherethe level and effects of weights and measures enforcement work were widelydifferent from the majority. This could have provided prima facie evidence ofthe need for further investigation by the Audit Commission to establish whetherthose variations were legitimate or represented a failure to achieve best value.However, the Commission would not be obliged, and sometimes not able, toconduct a Best Value inspection. So there has been no ready way for theDepartment to secure change in any case of weak local enforcement of weightsand measures legislation. 16 The Department currently does not have sufficient information with which to set defined standards for trading standards work generally or weights andmeasures enforcement in particular. Lack of use of local enforcement datareflects concerns about the consistency of local data and therefore thereliability of the national picture. The Laboratory is carrying out work to gain amore reliable national picture as part of the 2002-05 Legal MetrologyProgramme. In addition, the Department and the Laboratory have taken thelead in developing, along with local authority Trading Standards Departments,a new National Performance Framework for Trading Standards Services . The Framework, which was introduced in April 2002, and requires local authoritiesto provide annual Service Delivery Plans and performance information returns,is intended to improve the consistency, performance and capability of TradingStandards Departments. By October 2002, 87 per cent of local authorities hadprovided their Service Delivery Plans. The Framework will be supported by asystem of peer review, currently under development, designed to encourageimproved planning and performance. Alongside the Framework, theDepartment is also seeking to raise the capabilities of Trading StandardsDepartments through supporting the training and skills development of TradingStandards Officers. In time the Framework should improve the quality ofinformation available on local authority weights and measures enforcement. Atthe time of the National Audit Office review, the Department was consulting onthe level and type of information local authorities would be required toprovide. The information obtained will be fed back to local authorities,consumers and business by the publication of an annual report. 17 The Department currently has no means of measuring the effectiveness of Trading Standards Departments and the levels of compliance they achieveeither across the full range of the legislation they have to enforce or in relationto weights and measures legislation in particular. The National PerformanceFramework will increase the quality and quantity of information availableabout trading standards performance generally, and the Department hasproposed a number of performance measures, including one intended tomeasure compliance and the effectiveness of enforcement activity. This is acomposite measure, relating to the full range of trading standards activity,which will not by itself help the Department to identify effectiveness andcompliance levels with regard to weights and measures. At the time of theNational Audit Office review, the Department had decided that it will collectinformation specifically on weights and measures enforcement as well, but wasstill consulting local authorities on the exact information to be included.8executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 18 In order to ensure that the legislation is applied consistently, so that weights and measures used in trade are accurate, reliable and fair acrossthe country, the Department should: i) develop a coherent and comprehensive overview of the risks to accurate, fair and legal weights and measures in order to ensure that identificationand assessment cover the full range of potential risks and anyinterdependencies between them; ii) urgently pursue the modernisation and simplification of weights and measures legislation which it has identified as being out of date and over-complex so as to provide a clear basis for effective enforcement by theLaboratory and Trading Standards Departments;Recommendations9executive summaryREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES iii) develop the National Performance Framework in order to: a) establish baseline information on local weights and measures enforcement work which is accurate, timely and comprehensive; b) establish how weights and measures enforcement work can contribute to achieving defined standards of consumer protectionand fair trading, taking account of different local business profilesand the risks to accurate, fair and legal weights and measures theypresent; and c) introduce appropriate performance measures for local authority weights and measures enforcement work with which to monitorand help improve the performance of Trading StandardsDepartments, and to reduce variations in performance betweenthem; and iv) use the Framework to ensure that effective monitoring and inspection of weights and measures enforcement work is fully integrated withinbroader performance regimes for local authorities.'There shall be but one measure throughout the Realm...'

Everyweek around \u00a31 billion worth of retail goods are sold inthe United Kingdom on the basis of the measurement oftheir quantity 11. It is therefore vital that all trade measurement is accurate, fair and legal to buyer andseller. Consumers want assurance that the goods theypurchase have been correctly weighed and measured.Without this assurance, accurate price comparisons areimpossible. And businesses want confidence that theyare trading in a fair marketplace - profits from the sale ofcommodities such as petrol are often dependent uponsmall margins and incorrect measures can thereforedistort markets. 1.2 Consumers often cannot readily confirm that the quantity they have purchased is the actual amountreceived. For example, when buying petrol we have torely on the accuracy of the display on the petrol pump.Similarly, when buying spirits in a pub, the purchaserneeds to rely on the fact that the spirit measuringinstrument will provide the right amount. And withsome products, such as garden topsoil, it is impracticalfor the consumer to be able to re-weigh when it isdelivered (Figure 3) . 1.3 Businesses cannot easily check that the quantities of products being sold by competitors are accurate, andtherefore cannot know whether other companies areenjoying an unfair competitive advantage, eitheraccidentally, because their weighing and measuringequipment has started to operate outside acceptabletolerances (Figure 4) , or as a result of deliberate short weight selling (Figure 5) .The importance of weights and measures Short measure garden topsoil3 In 2001, a customer ordered three cubic metres of topsoil from a local garden centre and nursery in Braintree, Essex.When the soil was delivered, the quantity provided raisedconcerns but a subsequent complaint was dismissed by thegarden centre. When the amount of topsoil was measured byEssex Trading Standards Department, they found that only1.92 cubic metres had been delivered, a short measure of 36 per cent. The garden centre and nursery were convictedand ordered to pay a total of \u00a34,800 in fines and costs.

On 15occasions, boxes marked as containing 2000 sheets actuallycontained no more than 1,918 sheets and as few as 1,865sheets. The company was prosecuted and ordered to pay atotal of \u00a310,000. Source: Bath and North East Somerset Trading Standards DepartmentWhen Hampshire County Council Trading StandardsDepartment checked 100 weighbridges, used for weighingvehicles carrying a wide variety of products includingbuilding materials, foodstuffs and recycled waste, they foundthat 20 per cent were inaccurate enough for TradingStandards Officers to take action. One weighbridge had an error of 130 kilograms, more than three times the tolerance allowed. This represented a loss ofabout \u00a33 for each lorry leaving the site, or the equivalent ofnearly four litres of diesel. The error was quickly rectifiedbut, with 10.6 billion tonnes per kilometre of buildingmaterials being transported by road in the United Kingdomin 2000, the impact on industry and consumers of adding \u00a33to the cost of transport for each journey could be as muchas \u00a3250 million.

The regulation of weights and measures has the potential to address market failure,particularly in the case of small and medium businesses,as the example of 'warm petrol' shows (Figure 6) . Industry also benefits from the standard settingprocedures within legal metrology which allowcompliance with global standards and hence the abilityto compete overseas 14. On the non-economic side, legal metrology can enhance consumers' and traders'quality of life through the peace of mind that comesfrom knowing there is a system for ensuring thataccurate, fair and legal weights and measures are usedin trade. 1.5 The legislation is driven by the Weights and Measures Act 1985, which applies to England, Scotland andWales, and a number of European CommunityDirectives and Regulations. Responsibility forestablishing and maintaining the regulatory frameworkfor weights and measures lies with the Department ofTrade and Industry (the Department) and the NationalWeights and Measures Laboratory (the Laboratory), anexecutive agency of the Department. Enforcement of thelegislation falls to the Laboratory in matters relating tothe design of weighing and measuring equipment; andto over 200 local authority Trading StandardsDepartments for all other aspects. The system of controlis summarised in Figure 7 .'Warm petrol' - how regulating weights and measures used in trade could address the issue of market failure6 Petrol is supplied by oil companies to petrol retailers and sold to consumers on the basis of volume, not mass.Variations in the ambient temperature of petrol affects itsvolume. The Petrol Retailers Association has argued thatpetrol stations receive less fuel from oil companies than theyhave to pay for. Fuel is measured by volume on to roadtankers while the fuel is above ambient temperature. By thetime the petrol is sold at petrol stations it has cooled andreduced in volume. Vapour loss on delivery also results inless fuel being delivered than was loaded into the roadtanker. The banning of the use of dipsticks on new roadtankers (to prevent vapour loss to the atmosphere) means thatpetrol retailers have to accept the loading ticket as evidenceof the quantity they are receiving. Independent retailers, who are often small or medium sized businesses, have to compete with the bulk buying powers ofsupermarkets and the terms and conditions which large oilcompanies can agree with their outlets. The profit margins onthe sale of petrol are low and the relatively small lossesincurred as a result of delivery of petrol at higher thanambient temperature can have a substantial effect onprofitability, which smaller petrol retailers are less able tocope with. The Petrol Retailers Association has estimated thatthe total loss of revenue to small retailers due to losses inpetrol because of 'warm' delivery is \u00a380 million per year. Itis estimated that petrol loss is a significant factor in at least650 of the 1,300 petrol retail outlets which close each year. Legislation does not exist which would address this issue but if it did, such regulation could realise economic benefitsestimated at \u00a393 million per year, as a result of a reduction injob losses and increased sales revenue for petrol retailers. Thecase for regulation is based on the fact that there is noincentive for petrol suppliers to correct the situation due to thecost to them of complying with any new legislation and areduction in benefits they enjoy from supplying petrol athigher than ambient temperatures. This reduction has beenestimated by the National Engineering Laboratory (in a studycarried out on behalf of the National Weights and MeasuresLaboratory) at \u00a315 million per year. Intervention, throughregulation, could lead to fairer competition and, potentially,reduced market failure. The cost of implementing anylegislation has been estimated as a one-off cost of \u00a375 million.

Trading Standards Officers check a sample of packages taken off the production line to confirm that weight/volume is within acceptable tolerances (Reference Test) .Pre-packedRetail Goods Weighing and measuring equipment subject to regulations under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 Loose Trading Standards Officers check that equipment complies with the type approval certificate, where appropriate, and the relevant regulations (Verification) .Approved verifiers check that equipment complies with the type approval certificate, where appropriate, and the relevant regulations(Self-Verification) .Trading Standards Officers may check packer's own records; or packages warehoused prior to distribution to identify whether there is a need to carry out a Reference Test (Screening Test) .14part oneREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES The scope of the report 1.6 In 2000, the Better Regulation Task Force issued a good practice guide on regulation15. Among the principles set out was the importance of aiming legislation atdefined problems; the need to review legislation to testwhether they remain necessary and effective; and theneed to ensure that those enforcing the legislation doso consistently across the country. The weights andmeasures legislation is intended to ensure that definedstandards apply to the use of weights and measures intrade across the country. Consumer protection and fairtrading would not be served by the accuracy andreliability of weights and measures being allowed todiffer in different parts of the country. The legislationand its enforcement provide a system of control whichaims to ensure that weighing and measuringequipment is reliable and quantity information isaccurate. Against this background, this reportexamines the extent to which: !the Department has been able to identify thesignificant risks faced by consumers or businesseswith regard to weights or measures used for trade; !the legislation addresses those significant risks; and !the Department can monitor how effectively weightsand measures legislation is enforced. Details of the methodology we used to carry out the study are set out in the Appendix. 15 Better Regulation Task Force (2000), Principles of Good Regulation, Cabinet Office, London.Part 2 15 part twoInaccurate weights and measures used for trade can have asignificant effect 2.1 The effect of inaccurate weights and measures being used for trade, whilst not high at the level of theindividual transaction, is significant for the economy asa whole. For example, not selling full liquid measures ofdraught beer and cider allows licensees to sell about200 million more 'pints' a year than they buy in frombrewers and wholesalers, at an estimated value of about\u00a3130 million at wholesale prices. In 2000-01,estimates 16based on available evidence indicate that: !700,000 premises were using weights and measures in some form for the purposes of trade,which represented 39 per cent of the 1.8 millionpremises liable for inspection by Trading Standards Departments; !13,100 items of equipment failed at the verificationstage (less than one per cent of over three millionitems examined); !nearly 94,700 (five per cent) of the over two millionitems of equipment subsequently inspected inservice failed; !10,200 (10 per cent) of the 105,000 samples ofpackages tested at packing plants were found to beincorrect; and !77,100 (four per cent) of the 2.1 million items testedat retail outlets, were found to be incorrect. Risks to accurate, fair and legal weights and measures can arise for a number of reasons, and the nature ofthose risks can change over time. The ability to identify,monitor and assess the significance of different risksrequires being able to take a comprehensive view acrossall possible risks and the degree to which they relate toeach other.Responsibility for overseeing the legislation is split within the Department 2.2 Responsibility for oversight of the regulations is divided within the Department as follows: !the Department's Consumer and CompetitionPolicy Directorate (the Directorate) is responsible for the regulations relating to statutory definitions ofunits of measurement and units that are lawful foruse; ensuring that certain products be sold byquantity; certain pre-packed goods show a quantityindication; and that where quantity is shown, buyerscan rely on it (Parts IV and V of the 1985 Act); and !the Laboratory is responsible for the legislation relating to actual physical standards of units ofmeasurement; and the design of weighing andmeasuring equipment (Parts I, II and III of the 1985Act); it is also responsible for European CommunityDirectives on measuring instruments which fallwithin its field. 2.3 The Directorate and the Laboratory, whilst working separately on their particular areas of responsibility,have a number of formal and informal links, includingrepresentation on relevant Boards and Working Groups.This allows each to develop the expertise needed toprovide accurate and effective advice on what can becomplex and technical legislation, which increasinglyhas to take account of European and other internationalagreements; and the means to inform each other ofrelevant developments in their area of responsibility. Butthese co-ordination mechanisms do not constitute acomplete overview of weights and measures legislation. Part 2Identifying the significant risks to accurate, fair andlegal weights and measuresREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 16 Estimates have been grossed up from figures based on information from those local authorities who provided returns in 2000-01 (see paragraph 2.12).16part twoREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Technical risks are better monitored and assessed than other risks 2.4 Maintaining an up to date view of the risks to achieving accurate, fair and legal weights and measures requiresregular information on which to base any assessment ofchanges in those risks and to judge whether thelegislation continues to be adequate to deal with them.In this respect, the Directorate and the Laboratory usedifferent methods with which to gather information. Thisinformation is not brought together to provide a singledocumented risk assessment covering all aspects ofweights and measures legislation. Information on non-technical risks is gathered in a more ad-hoc manner 2.5 The Directorate maintains formal and informal contact with consumer and commercial interests, and localauthorities, with regard to those aspects of the weightsand measures legislation for which it is responsible. TheDirectorate has undertaken a number of consultationexercises with regard to modernising the law on the saleof goods sold by quantity 17, including tightening consumer protection against being sold short measurewhen buying draught beer and cider 18, 19 . These exercises have provided an opportunity for theDepartment to identify concerns amongst industry andconsumers about the risks to accurate, fair and reliableweights and measures. In order to identify the risks,costs and benefits of the changes proposed in theconsultation exercises, each was accompanied by aRegulatory Impact Assessment 20. Early assessments, whilst describing some of the costs and benefits toconsumers and businesses in qualitative terms, lackedany quantification of what those costs and benefitsmight be. However, in the case of draught beer andcider, a second consultation did include extensivequantification of costs. 2.6 The Directorate also commissions external research when it considers it necessary to secure moreinformation about a particular issue. These are oftenraised by organisations outside the Department,including Trading Standards Departments, consumergroups, manufacturers and retailers; or in response toEuropean Community developments. The Directorate has a budget to cover research across its areas ofresponsibility from which funding can be provided forweights and measures-related research. In 2002-03,total funding of \u00a3850,000 was available. Since 1997 theDirectorate has commissioned three external studies ontechnical issues associated with testing the drained netweight of products pre-packed in added liquid or iceglaze, at a total cost of \u00a335,000; and five studies intoconsumer attitudes to quantity information and the rolesuch information plays in consumers making value formoney comparisons at a total cost of \u00a3140,000. TheDirectorate also takes account of research undertakenby other organisations. These arrangements provide adegree of capability, but the fact that funding for weightsand measures research has to compete with otherresearch priorities within the Directorate raises thepossibility that not all weights and measures researchwill be done in a timely fashion; although to date noresearch project has been turned down for funding, orhas had to be delayed or abandoned because of lack offunding. There is a well-established programme of research on technical risks 2.7 Every three years the Laboratory and the National Measurement System Directorate within theDepartment agree a programme (the Legal MetrologyProgramme) as part of the National MeasurementSystem 21specifying the work the Laboratory will do on the Department's behalf in the field of legal metrology.Its content is driven largely by the Weights andMeasures Act 1985, European Community legislationand the International Organisation of Legal Metrology. Itprovides an opportunity to address emerging issuesrelating to the regulation of equipment, and enablesthem to identify and assess new and changing risksarising from technical aspects of weights and measures,including matters of concern to industry and consumers.The current Programme, which runs from 2002 to 2005,has a value of \u00a37.4 million; of this about \u00a32.2 million 22 is on work which is most directly relevant to theidentification and assessment of risks. 17 Department of Trade and Industry (1999), Fair measure: a consultation on modernising the law on the sale of goods sold by quant ity. 18 Department of Trade and Industry (2000), Measures of draught beer and cider: Public consultation paper on proposed legislative changes under the Weights and Measures Act 1985. 19 Department of Trade and Industry (2002), Draught beer and cider: Public consultation on proposals to tighten consumer protectio n against short measure, CA 003/02. 20 A Regulatory Impact Assessment sets out the risks, costs and benefits of any new regulatory proposal which has an impact on bu sinesses, charities and voluntary bodies. 21 The National Measurement System is the infrastructure of laboratories and services which ensure that users can be confident t hat their measurements and those of their customers and suppliers are consistently traceable back to nationally and internationally accepted primary refer ence standards - and are therefore both valid and fit for purpose. The System supports measurement for use in trade, industry, academia and government. 22 The \u00a32.2 million is made up of \u00a30.2 million on work on fuel related legislation responding to concerns amongst petrol retaile rs that they receive less fuel from oil companies than they pay for due to changes in temperature whilst in transit to petrol stations; \u00a30.4 million on the Lab oratory's work in ensuring that regulations are applied consistently and correctly throughout the United Kingdom; and \u00a31.5 million on raising awareness of weigh ts and measures used in trade and responding to specific issues and queries from stakeholders.17 part twoREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 2.8 The Programme includes: reviewing and producing legislation which seeks to protect the consumer andcompetitive markets; representing the United Kingdom'sinterests overseas; maintaining facilities so that theLaboratory can, for example, test whether weighing andmeasuring equipment is accurate, fair and legal; andsupporting the work of Trading Standards Departments,including providing information to them, manufacturersand other enquirers to enhance understanding of thesystem for regulating weights and measures. It addressesboth statutory requirements and specific issues ofinterest to stakeholder groups. For example, as part ofthe 1999-02 Programme, the Laboratory responded toconcerns raised by licensees and introduced an Order 23 which allows the use of 70ml 'double' spirit measures. 2.9 To provide an external view of what should be included in the Programme, therefore, the formulation procedurealso includes consultation with interested parties suchas the Consumers Association, the Trading StandardsInstitute and the Local Authority Co-ordinators ofRegulatory Services, as well as with a working groupmade up of unpaid volunteers representing a variety ofstakeholders including manufacturers. 2.10 The Laboratory's performance in delivering the Programme is measured by reference to two key targets,one measuring the proportion of task milestonesdelivered by due dates, the other aimed at assessing theextent to which the Programme as a whole has beencompleted. However, the measures they have beenusing provide only a partial view of progress. Up to2001-02, the milestone target covered only 35 per centof the value of the Programme. From 2002-03 all of theProgramme will be covered by milestones which willimprove the coverage of the target. However, finalmilestones - which should signal the completion of theobjective - have no separate status or greater weightingthan interim milestones which chart progress towards anobjective. For some ongoing aspects of the Programme,such as the provision of advice and responding toenquiries, differential weighting may not be appropriate;but for other, more project-based elements, it will helpto ensure that objectives are fully completed. This helpsto avoid the situation where the majority of funds on aproject have been used but the final milestone, and theoften significant benefits which only come withachievement of that milestone, remain unrealised. Inaddition, although the high legislative and policycontent of the Programme may mean that conventionalmeasures of research quality may not be appropriate,the quality of work, in terms of the extent to which theoutcomes and achievements have met the Programme'sobjectives, have not been subject to formal assessmentby the Department in a way which allows it to rate thesuccess of each three-year programme or makecomparisons between successive programmes. The National Measurement System Directorate monitors theLaboratory's performance through a series of monthly,quarterly and annual reports, and an annual review bythe Programme's working group. But the focus is onmonitoring progress by task against milestones which, initself, will not guarantee achievement of theProgramme's objectives. Risk assessment could have made more use of information on localcompliance with the legislation 2.11 Data has been available to the Department since 1988 which is relevant to building up a national picture of therisks to weights and measures and how those riskschange over time. Trading Standards Departments arerequired, under section 70 of the Weights and MeasuresAct 1985, to provide annual returns containinginformation on the weights and measures enforcementactivity; the results of that activity; and the nature of anyinfringements identified. Changes in the levels ofcompliance and in the nature of non-compliance overtime can help to identify where legislation may need tobe extended or even removed. However, these returnshave not been regularly analysed by the Department.Returns for the years 1990-91 to 1993-94 were analysedby an external consultant to identify Trading StandardsDepartments whose performance with regard to thelevel of weights and measures activity was particularlylow. In 2000, the Laboratory analysed returns for anumber of Trading Standards Departments over anumber of years as part of work intended to helpestablish a clearer picture of the state of local weightsand measures work, but concerns over the quality ofsome of the data led to no conclusions being drawn.And the Directorate analysed available returns for theyears 2000-01 and 2001-02 to identify the extent towhich business premises were being visited by TradingStandards Departments for weights and measurespurposes, as part of preparation for the RegulatoryReform Order to be introduced in 2004 (see paragraph3.8). Apart from these exercises, the Department has notsought to analyse the returns on a regular basis in orderto identify trends over time in levels of weights andmeasures activity or the results of that activity. Nor hasit provided routine feedback to Trading StandardsDepartments on the information collected. However,the information obtained through the NationalPerformance Framework for Trading Standards Services,introduced in April 2002 (see paragraph 4.15), will befed back to local authorities, consumers and business bythe publication of annual reports. 23 The Weights and Measures (Intoxicating liquor) (Amendment) Order 2001.18part twoREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 2.12 Furthermore, Trading Standards Departments are required by statute to provide these returns, but inrecent years, not all authorities have provided thisinformation on a regular basis. Figure 8 shows that for the three years 1998-99 to 2000-01, only 61 (31 per cent)of the 198 Trading Standards Departments provided theDepartment with a return each year. Six authoritiesprovided no returns at all over this period.The percentage of Trading Standards Departments providing section 70 returns in each of the years 1998-99 to 2000-018 Source: National Audit Office analysis of section 70 returns for the years 1998-99 to 2000-01100 908070605040302010 0% of Trading Standards Departments 3323134 None 1 year 2 years 3 yearsPart 3REGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Matching legislation to risks 19 part three3.1 Good legislation should be targeted at where problems exist and be easy to understand if they are to beeffective 24. Part 3 looks at the extent to which weights and measures legislation covers the most significantrisks and the steps the Department have taken to ensurethe legislation is easy to understand.Existing legislation covers most longstanding risks and blatant attempts to sell short weight or measure 3.2 Figure 9 identifies the most significant risks to achieving accurate, fair and legal weights and measures, andcompares those risks with the legislation. Significant risks to weights and measures and how they are covered by the legislation Source: National Audit Office analysis of the Weights and Measures Act 19859 The suitability for use for trade of the design of weighing and measuring equipment has to be approved before that equipment is allowed to beplaced on the market. No piece of weighing and measuring equipment can be used for trade until it has been passed as fit for use (verified) by an inspector and 'stamped' asproof that it has been passed. Inspectors have powers to inspect and test weighing and measuring equipment in use to ensure that they continue to operate within acceptabletolerances. Operators of public weighing and measuring equipment must hold a certificate issued by a Chief Inspector of Weights and Measures before theycan operate. Such equipment can be subject to routine inspections tocheck that they continue to operate within acceptable tolerances. Certain products and packages are required to show quantity markings. The weight of individual packages is controlled by the average quantity system, whereby automated packing processes are required to produceindividual packages whose weight or volume must fall within prescribedlimits either above or below a nominal value. Trading Standards Officers have statutory powers to enter premises to inspect equipment and make sample purchases of products to check thatquantities are accurate, fair and legal. 'Working' standards used by Trading Standards Officers have to be calibrated to local standards held by Trading Standards Departments, whichare themselves calibrated to national standards by the Laboratory. Each local authority has to appoint a suitably qualified Chief Inspector of Weights and Measures. Trading Standards Officers have to hold prescribedqualifications in order to carry out their statutory duties. The Departmenthas the power to inspect local authority arrangements for enforcing weightsand measures legislation.The design of weighing and measuring equipment will lead, either accidentally or deliberately, to inaccuratequantities being sold. Weighing and measuring equipment which has been installed does not conform with the approved design. Equipment ceases to provide accurate, fair and legal weights or measures after installation due to eitherwear and tear or deliberate tampering. Public weighing or measuring equipment, for which a charge is made (for example, weighbridges) will not beoperated properly. Consumers will not know how much of a produce they are purchasing. Automated packing processes will lead to unacceptable variations in the weight of individual packages. Goods will be sold short weight or in short measure.Units of measurement used to assess compliance with the legislation will not be consistent across the country. Inspectors will not have the necessary skills to enforce the legislation effectively.Significant risks Are they covered in the legislation? 24 Better Regulation Task Force (2000), Principles of Good Regulation, Cabinet Office.20part threeREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES The legislation largely covers longstanding risks; and blatant attempts to sell short weight or shortmeasure goods; to fail to inform, or to mislead theconsumer on quantity. But much of the legislation has become increasingly out of date 3.3 Whilst covering the significant risks, the legislation has become increasingly out of date in many respects. TheWeights and Measures Act 1985 is largely aconsolidation of requirements set out in the Weights andMeasures Acts of 1963, 1976 and 1979. Much of thelegislation in force today is, therefore, nearly 40 yearsold. As a result, anomalies have arisen and in somerespects the legislation has failed to keep up withtechnological developments: !nails need to be sold by weight or number butscrews or tacks do not; !bias binding needs to be sold by length but velcrodoes not; !writing paper needs to be sold by number of sheetsbut photocopying or typing paper do not; !goods which were only sold wholesale in the past,and not covered by the legislation, can now bebought retail in the same quantities (for example,Do-It-Yourself products) but remain outside thelegislation; and !different pre-packed products have differentthresholds above which quantity markings arerequired (for example, above 5g for rice, but above50g for biscuits and sugar). Where products remain outside the legislation, there is no requirement for quantity information to be shown;although if a statement of quantity is voluntarily providedthat product comes within the legislation as well.Consumers can, therefore, be deprived of the informationthey need to compare one such product with another.Similarly, technological advances, based on electronic orcomputerised processes, make it more difficult for thoseenforcing the legislation to know whether weighing andmeasuring equipment is compliant. 3.4 There has been some recognition of the effect of technology on the accuracy and reliability of weightsand measures; and the Laboratory have undertaken aprogramme of updating the technical aspects of thelegislation through work carried out as part of the LegalMetrology Programme. Part V of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 implemented European CommunityDirectives which required Member States to introducethe average system of quantity control for certain pre-packaged goods. This was a departure from thetraditional system, dating back to the Magna Carta,where quantity controls were based on ensuring that thebuyer received at least a minimum quantity. The move tothe average quantity system 25is a recognition that there are inherent errors in all weighing and measuringequipment, especially automated packing systems. 3.5 Technological innovation has also increased the accuracy and reliability of the manufacture andinstallation of weighing and measuring equipment sothat there is less need for an inspector of weights andmeasures to verify the installation or repair of everypiece of equipment. Recognition of this led to thederegulation 26in 1999 of the verification procedures on certain types of new and repaired equipment (forexample, petrol pumps). Since then, manufacturers,installers or repairers with appropriate quality systemshave been allowed to 'self-verify' that installedequipment conforms with the approved design, ratherthan such checks being carried out by Trading StandardsOfficers. In addition, from 1980, manufacturers of non-automatic weighing instruments (for example, shopcounter scales) have been able to obtain a single designapproval which is valid throughout the EuropeanCommunity rather than seek separate approvals in eachMember State as was needed before. Other changes tosecondary legislation have reflected the introduction ofnew technology, for example, the use of automaticfilling instruments which sub-divide products such assnack foods from bulk into pre-determined quantities. The legislation has also become increasingly complex 3.6 The growth in legislation, however, has meant that it has become an increasingly complex combination ofEuropean obligations and domestic legislation. They havealso been framed to reflect the recommendations andguidance of international bodies such as the InternationalOrganisation of Legal Metrology. In 1998, the BetterRegulation Task Force 27concluded that weights and measures legislation on packaged goods was too complexand did not aid consumer protection. Many of theindustry associations and Trading Standards Departmentsthe National Audit Office spoke to in the course of thisexamination confirmed that this was still the case. Forexample, the two European Community Directives 28 25 The actual quantity of product in a batch of packages may not be less on average than the quantity indicated on the packages, and no packages in the batch may be deficient by more than the specified tolerances. That is, a proportion of packages may be under-filled within the pe rmitted tolerance, provided that there is compensating over-fill in the other packages. 26 The Deregulation (Weights and Measures) Order 1999, SI 1999/503.27 Better Regulation Task Force (1998), Better Regulation Task Force Review: Consumer Affairs, Central Office of Information.28 Directive 75/106/EEC on the making-up by volume of certain liquids; Directive 76/211/EEC on the making-up by volume of certain pre-packaged products.21 part threeREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES which introduced the average quantity system run to 12 pages. The United Kingdom legislation whichimplements these Directives comprises more than 100 pages of primary and secondary legislation, plusguidance notes for packers and inspectors and codes ofpractice for certain industry sectors. Complexity arisesfrom the need to ensure that permitting deficiencies in a small proportion of packages does not result in asystematic short measure in all packages. But the 1999Consumer White Paper recognised the problem thatcomplex and outdated legislation can present,concluding that it 'confuses businesses and... consumerswho have little, if any, idea of what [quantity information]they should see' 29. New businesses, in particular, face a steep learning curve with regard to the average quantitysystem which is particularly burdensome for smalltraders. Misunderstandings about the requirements canlead to incorrect information being provided which inturn can adversely affect consumers. Complex legislationis also harder to enforce in a consistent manner. Growinguncertainty with some aspects of weights and measureslegislation is reflected in the debate about how muchliquid a consumer is entitled to receive when ordering adraught pint of beer or cider (Figure 10 overleaf) . Such uncertainty increases the risk of non-compliancewith the legislation. The Department has endeavoured to update and simplify the legislationbut progress has been slow 3.7 Following the 1999 White Paper, in the same year, the Department started consultation on modernising the lawon those parts of the Weights and Measures Act 1985which related to the sale of goods by quantity 30. Initially, the Department had intended to replace PartsIV and V of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 withprimary legislation introduced through the ConsumerProtection Bill, but the Bill eventually fell in 2000 dueto the lack of Parliamentary time for primary legislation.In 2000 31and 200232, the Department consulted on the specific issue of clarifying the law about whatconstitutes a 'full' measure of draught beer and cider.But progress has been slow due to the Department notbeing able to achieve a consensus between trade and consumer groups, and Trading Standards Departmentson the best way forward without increasing the price ofbeer generally. Alongside this exercise, the Departmentwas engaged in a broader programme to overhaul theconsumer provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973through the Enterprise Act 2002. This and the workunderway on consumer credit took priority forlegislative resources in this area. The Department hasintroduced voluntary codes instead of legislation (forexample, on testing the accuracy of indications ofdrained net weight) and started discussions on othercodes (for example, minimum fill levels in packagedbreakfast cereals). But the absence of a slot in theprimary legislative programme has hampered progresson achieving a more fundamental update of thelegislation, as any changes must consequently belimited to the scope and vires of secondary legislation. 3.8 In the short term, the main changes on packaged goods are being taken forward by a Regulatory Reform Order,which is expected to come into force in 2004; and by aconsolidation of seven orders regulating pre-packagedfoodstuffs. In the longer term, the European Communityis committed to a major update and simplification ofCommunity legislation on packaged goods, following areview under the Community's Simplified Legislation forthe Internal Market programme. 3.9 The introduction of self-verification of weighing and measuring equipment introduced in 1999 represents adegree of progress in improving the law on thoseaspects of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 whichrelate to the design, installation and use of weighingand measuring equipment. However, more generally,there has been a lack of progress in updating thelegislation with regard to these aspects too.Consultations on these aspects were planned to start in1999 but have been delayed awaiting theimplementation of the European CommunityMeasuring Instruments Directive. The Directive isintended to extend the single market for measuringinstruments and take account of technological progressand new types of instruments, but it is not expected tocome into force until 2005 at the earliest. 29 Department of Trade and Industry (1999), Modern Markets: Confident Consumers, paragraph 6.11. 30 Department of Trade and Industry (1999), Fair measure: a consultation document on modernising the law on the sale of goods sold by quantity. 31 Department of Trade and Industry (2000), Measures of draught beer and cider: public consultation paper on proposed legislative changes under the Weights and Measures Act 1985. 32 Department of Trade and Industry (2002), Draught beer and cider: public consultation on proposals to tighten consumer protectio n against short measure, No. CA 003/02.Better Regulation Task Force Review of Consumer Affairs, 1998.'From consultations and discussions over many years it has been made clear to the DTI that businesses, local government bodies, trading standards organisations and others consider[legislation on packaged goods] to beunnecessarily burdensome, complex and of disbenefit to consumers.'22part threeREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES The 'froth on beer' debate Source: Department of Trade and Industry (2000), Measures of draught beer and cider: public consultation paper on proposed legisla tive changes under the Weights and Measures Act 1985.10 Current legislation on beer measures date from the Weights and Measures Act 1963. The 1963 Act was silent on whether the gas in the head of froth is part of the measure. Subsequent case law failed to remedy this uncertainty. Some of the cases only concluded that what constitutes a pint of beer de pends on the particular facts of each case, bearing in mind local expectations and the type of beer. The Weights and Measures Acts 1979 and 1985 both provided that gas was not part of the measure but the provision was not brought into force in either case (an Order was ma de in 1992 which would have brought the relevant section of the 1985 Act into force in 1994, but this was revoked in 1993). In the 1997-98 Parliamentary Session, a Private Members Bill, the Weights and Measures (Beer and Cider) Bill was sponsored by Mr Dennis Turner MP, which would have restored the relevant section of the 1985 Act. However, the Bill fell at the Report Stage in the House of Commons. Surveys carried out in 1997 showed that the licensing trade's voluntary guidelines that liquid should form at least 95 per cent of the measure were widely disregarded. Surveys indicated that the proportion of 'pints' with less than this amount of liquid ranged f rom 14 per cent to 70 per cent. The Department estimated that licensees who serve less than full liquid measures collectively sell about 200 million more 'pints' per year than they buy from brewers and wholesalers. The annual value of such short measure is estimat ed to be about \u00a3130 million at wholesale prices. There has been no clear consensus on whether measures of beer and cider should be defined as 95 per cent or 100 per cent liquid . The licensing trade supported the lower limit on the grounds that 100 per cent would require licensees to over-fill in order to avo id the risk of under measure, with an extra annual cost of \u00a3250 million. Trading Standards Departments, however, were concerned that less than 100 per cent liquid would set a precedent for other goods to be sold at less than their stated quantity.Part 4REGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Monitoring the enforcement of weights and measureslegislation 23 part fourMaintaining confidence in weights and measures legislation dependson enforcement 4.1 Enforcement is a vital part of any regulatory regime, as legislation is of little value if it is widely disregarded.Consumer and business confidence that weights andmeasures used in trade are accurate, fair and legaldepends on such a regime being effective andconsistently applied across the country. Researchsponsored by the Department 33indicated there are a number of reasons why consumers paid little attentionto quantity information on packaged goods. Theseincluded assumptions by consumers that retailers wouldnot stock products which were deceptively packaged(46 per cent of those consulted); or that they wereadequately protected by the enforcement regime (40 per cent). Enforcement does not just involvepenalties and sanctions against those who fail tocomply, but also involves educating consumers andbusinesses as to what the requirements of the law are. Design and calibration requirements are enforced by the Laboratory 4.2 The enforcement of weights and measures legislation is divided between the Laboratory and local authorityTrading Standards Departments. Up until 1975, theLaboratory was the sole grantor of 'national' typeapproval certificates for all new designs of measuringequipment intended for use in the United Kingdom toensure they were capable of providing accurate weightsand measures. Between 1975 and 1980, the Laboratoryalso began to carry out 'European' type approval workfor certain types of equipment which were intended foruse either in the United Kingdom or in other parts of theEuropean Community. From 1980 34, the scope of legislation on the provision of 'European' type approvalchanged so that such approvals for all non-automaticweighing instruments, such as shop counter scales, could be provided by any appropriate 'approving' bodyin the European Community and apply in all MemberStates. Consequently, the Laboratory no longer checksnew designs for all equipment intended to be used inthe United Kingdom. Whilst approval bodies work tocommon standards, some industry representative bodiescontacted by the National Audit Office were of the viewthat documentation provided by some of them providedonly the minimum information about the approveddesign required. This could affect the effectiveness ofverification work which relies on such information totest whether equipment complies with the approveddesign. In contrast, they felt the Laboratory providedmore fulsome information which was more helpful tothe verification process. 4.3 The technical quality of the Laboratory's approval work is subject to a formal quality management system. Someof the Laboratory's facilities are accredited by UnitedKingdom Accreditation Service. The speed of approval isalso important. Quick approvals allow equipmentmanufacturers to introduce new designs to the marketmore rapidly with related commercial benefits. Andfrom the Laboratory's point of view, the speed ofapprovals is important if it is to compete successfullywith other 'approving' bodies. In 2000-01, theLaboratory carried out 20 European type approvals and80 National approvals. On European approvals,reported performance shows that in each year since1996-97 at least 95 per cent of customers have had theirapprovals processed within 10 weeks. And since 1999,average processing time has fallen from 6.2 weeks to 4.4 weeks. Under both measures, performance has beenwell within targeted levels. Internal targets have been setfor National type approval work since 1997. In general,the targets have been tightened and performance hasimproved over time, although 1999-2000 was the onlyyear in which the Laboratory achieved all the targets setfor non-European work. The Laboratory does not collateregularly information on instances where installed 33 Lennard, D., V-W.Mitchell, P .McGoldrick and E.Betts (2001), Why consumers under-use food quantity indicators, The International Re view of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 11(2), pp 177-199. 34 The change was implemented by the Measuring Instruments (EEC Requirements) (Amendment No.3) Regulations 1979 (SI 1979/1459).24part fourREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES equipment is found by Trading Standards Departments for which no type approval certificate exists, although ittold the National Audit Office that such breaches wererare. Nor does it collate regularly instances whereinstalled equipment does not conform with theapproved designs for such equipment. Manufacturers,Trading Standards Departments and 'self-verifiers' havemore information in this respect, although theLaboratory receives little feedback from these sources.As part of the 1999-2002 Legal Metrology Programme,the Laboratory did carry out a limited investigation intothe degree of conformity of installed non-automaticweighing instruments. The results were, according to theLaboratory, 'not completely satisfactory' and itconcluded that a larger number of items of equipmentshould be tested in the future. Compiling information ona regular basis about unapproved equipment wouldhelp the Laboratory identify the extent to which installedequipment was bypassing the regulatory framework. 4.4 The Laboratory also ensures that the physical standards of measurement used by Trading Standards Departmentsto carry out tests and checks remain accurate - normaluse can result in small but significant changes in theiraccuracy. Each set of local standards is re-calibrated tonational standards once every five years or 10 years bythe Laboratory depending on the category of thestandard. Local authorities are required by law to holdlocal standards, except where they have been granted adispensation by the Laboratory, acting on behalf of theSecretary of State. Local government reorganisation andother changes have meant that some authorities can nolonger justify maintaining their own set of localstandards and rely instead on using those held byanother authority. Authorities who do not holdstandards, or do not have access to local standards, runthe risk that they will not be able to carry out validverification and inspection work, as working standards(which Trading Standards Officers use in the executionof their duties) and testing equipment have to be testedagainst local standards at intervals prescribed in thelegislation. As at February 2003, 89 (43 per cent) of thetotal of 206 Trading Standards Departments held localstandards. A further 97 (47 per cent) authorities haddispensation not to hold local standards, largelybecause they shared standards with a number of otherauthorities. The remaining 20 (10 per cent) did not holdstandards either but had yet to seek a dispensationdespite being instructed by the Laboratory to do so.Trading Standards Departments are responsible for enforcing therequirements on weights andmeasures used for trade 4.5 Enforcement of the requirements governing the installation and use of weighing and measuringequipment; and of the provision of quantity informationfor the purposes of trade is carried out by local authorityTrading Standards Departments. However, this is onlyone of their responsibilities: typically, a TradingStandards Department can be responsible for enforcingthe requirements of over 80 Acts of Parliament, plusmany more pieces of subordinate legislation. 4.6 Local authorities have a number of legal duties with regard to ensuring compliance with weights andmeasures legislation. Apart from holding local standards(see paragraph 4.4), these duties include theappointment of a Chief Inspector of Weights andMeasures in each authority; and providing annualreturns on weights and measures enforcement activity tothe Department. Certain provisions in the legislationplace an explicit duty on local authorities with regard tothe testing of weighing and measuring instruments.National Audit Office visits to Trading StandardsDepartments and discussions with representative bodiesshowed that they undertake a range of enforcementaction in relation to weights and measures legislation.These include programmes of inspections of premisesfor metrological, as well as other trading standardspurposes; special projects targeted at particular sectorsor potential risks; and education and awarenesscampaigns to help consumers and businessesunderstand better the requirements of the law onweights and measures used for trade. Trading StandardsOfficers are appointed by statute and have wide powersof entry to premises and test purchase of goods to checkcompliance with the law. 4.7 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in England, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly Governmenthave the lead within Government for developing aconsistent approach to the improvement of local servicesgenerally. Within this overall framework, local authoritiesare accountable to the local electorate and theexpectation is that they will take a balanced and sensibleview of where their priorities should lie across their rangeof responsibilities. The Department of Trade and Industryis responsible for maintaining the regulatory frameworkfor weights and measures and for ensuring that thelegislation is enforceable, but relies on Trading Standards25 part fourREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Departments to enforce the legislation locally. Whilst variations in the level and nature of weights and measuresenforcement should be expected, given differing localcircumstances, they should be sufficiently consistentbetween local authorities to ensure the achievement ofminimum standards of consumer protection and fairtrading. Against this background, the National AuditOffice looked at the extent to which variations existedbetween Trading Standards Departments in the scale andresults of their enforcement work on weights andmeasures; and whether there was a defined minimumstandard of consumer protection and fair trading whichsuch work was intended to contribute to. Wide andunexplained variations raise the possibility that suchminimum standards are not being achieved across theUnited Kingdom. Wide variations exist in the scale and results of local enforcement work raising questionsabout the maintenance of defined standards 4.8 Wide variations exist in the scale of trading standards work generally. An Audit Commission review35of trading standards authorities in 1999 highlighted majorvariations in the levels and types of service provided by,and in the performance of, these authorities. In 2002,the Accounts Commission published a review 36of trading standards services in Scotland which also foundwide variability in the level and quality of servicesprovided. The National Audit Office analysed available data relating specifically to Trading StandardsDepartments' weights and measures work to identifywhether variations were present here as well. Figure 11 sets out variations between different types of localauthorities in the average level of local weights andmeasures inspections and the average rates of non-compliance for equipment verified and inspected, andgoods checked in 2000-01. 4.9 The averages in Figure 11 hide wide variations between authorities of the same type. For example, thepercentage of premises which were liable for a visit formetrological purposes which were actually visited byCounty Council Trading Standards Departments rangedfrom 6.9 per cent to 25 per cent in 2000-01; andbetween 10.9 per cent and 55.4 per cent forMetropolitan Boroughs (Figure 12 overleaf) . 4.10 The Department has no legal powers to set minimum levels of inspection for metrology purposes. The fact thatnot all premises had been visited on an annual basis isdue to Trading Standards Departments basing thefrequency of visits on an assessment of the risk thatindividual premises represent across the range of tradingstandards legislation. This assessment is based onguidance issued by the representative body the LocalAuthority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services, whorecommend that high risk premises are visited annually;medium risk premises once every two years; and low 35 Audit Commission (1999), Measure for measure: the Best Value agenda for trading standards services. 36 Accounts Commission (2002), Made to measure?

Within this guidance there is an element of local discretion; and theTrading Standards Departments visited by the NationalAudit Office confirmed that it was important to be ableto reflect local priorities in their inspection programme. 4.11 Given its lack of legal powers, the Department does not check the extent to which inspection frequencies meetthe recommended guidance but the difference can bequite marked. In 2000-01, on average, only 56 per centof high risk businesses were visited by Trading StandardsDepartments for all inspection purposes 38. The percentage for individual authorities ranged from two per cent up to well over 100 per cent, reflecting thefact that some authorities were visiting very few highrisk premises whereas others were visiting them more than once a year (Figure 13) . These figures relate just to English and Welsh authorities, but the AccountsCommission's 2002 review 39also highlighted that Scottish local authorities regularly failed to meet theirinspection targets for high risk premises. It is notpossible to tell from these figures whether premisesassessed as high risk primarily for metrology reasonswere being visited with the recommended frequency. 4.12 The percentage of items of equipment found to be non- compliant with the weights and measures legislation atverification and when inspected in use, whilst not largein themselves, reveal large differences between differenttypes of local authority (Figure 11). In 2000-01, theaverage failure rate at verification for Unitary Authoritieswas 39 times higher than for London Boroughs. And theaverage percentage of samples of packages inspected atpacking plants which failed was almost three timeshigher in Unitary Authorities than in Wales. Similarly, ananalysis of the variations in the percentages of samplesof packages checked at packing plants (Figure 14) and items tested at the point of sale (Figure 15 on page 28) found to be incorrect reveals differences between typesof local authority and between Trading StandardsDepartments within the same type of authority. The Department has insufficient information to identify the contribution local enforcementshould make to a defined standard forconsumer protection and fair trading 4.13 Variations between authorities should be expected. Different Trading Standards Departments are faced withvarying business profiles. One authority may have largenumbers of packaging plants whereas another may havea significant number of retail centres, both of which canraise different potential risks to accurate, fair and legalweights and measures. An effective national weightsand measures regime, however, requires the ability toidentify where variations are due to legitimate responsesto local conditions, or where they are due to otherfactors which may compromise the effectiveness of localenforcement work and the attainment of definedstandards of consumer protection and fair trading. Thestatutory weights and measures returns from localauthorities have provided the Department with apotentially important source of data about localenforcement activity. The Department had theseanalysed by a consultant in consecutive years in theearly nineties (see paragraph 2.11).

The updated guidanc e focused on the frequency of 'appropriate enforcement actions' including inspections; whereas the earlier guidance which is relevant to the peri od in which the analysis in Figure 12 relates referred to the frequency of inspections alone. 38 The risk rating does not always reflect the metrological risk. For example, a landfill site may have a low overall risk from a consumers point of view, but represent a high metrological risk because the weighbridge used to weigh incoming fill materials (as a basis for tax collection) could be subjec t to adverse environmental conditions. 39 Accounts Commission (2002), Made to measure? An overview of trading standards services in Scotland.27 part fourREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES showed little year on year change and the Department concluded that it was not necessary at that time tocontinue this analysis every year. Further analysis wasdone in 2000, 2001 and 2002 although this did not leadto conclusions about the results of weights andmeasures enforcement activity. In future, theinformation provided through the National PerformanceFramework for Trading Standards Services (seeparagraph 4.15), which will include but not be limitedto weights and measures information, will be analysedand published each year. 4.14 The Department has powers to inspect local authorities for the purpose of gathering information aboutarrangements for enforcing weights and measureslegislation, but these powers were last used in 1964.There may have been no cause to use them.

Each bar represents a single Trading Standards Department.28part fourREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES in the Audit Commission's 1999 review41and the Accounts Commission's 2002 study42, as well as the variations identified in this current review, suggest thatthere would have been grounds for inspecting localarrangements in the interests of maintaining consistencynationally. However, these powers do not allow theDepartment to intervene to address cases of poorperformance. Since 1999, local authority tradingstandards work, including weights and measuresenforcement work, has been covered by the Best Valueinspection regime which includes powers to allow theappropriate Secretary of State to intervene where localauthorities fail to provide best value. Any decision to intervene, however, must be based on an authority'sperformance against one or more Best Valueperformance indicators. Trading standards work iscovered by a single indicator which is now recognisedas being inadequate for the purposes of identifying theextent to which best value has been achieved. In theabsence of an appropriate indicator, regularDepartmental analysis of the statutory returns it receivesfrom local authorities could have helped to identifyauthorities where the level and effects of weights andmeasures enforcement work were widely different fromthe majority. This could have provided prima facieevidence of the need for further investigation by theAudit Commission to establish whether those variationswere legitimate or represented a failure to achieve bestvalue. However, the Commission would not be obliged,and sometimes not able, to conduct a Best Valueinspection. So there has been no ready way for theDepartment to secure change in any case of weak localenforcement of weights and measures legislation. The Department is taking steps to improve the consistency, performance and capabilityof Trading Standards Departments 4.15 Lack of use of local enforcement data reflects concerns about the consistency of local data and therefore thereliability of national figures. In response, new projectshave been included in the Laboratory's 2002-05 LegalMetrology Programme which will examine whetherweights and measures legislation is being followed andapplied consistently and correctly. The projects includecollating and analysing information on the currentprovision of weights and measures services across theUnited Kingdom and funding Trading Standards Officersto carry out a range of specified tests on measuringequipment. In addition, the Department and theLaboratory have taken the lead in developing, alongwith representatives of local authority Trading StandardsDepartments, a new National Performance Framework for Trading Standards Services which was introduced for all trading standards activities from April 2002. TheFramework is intended to promote consistentenforcement and service delivery. It includes therequirement for each Trading Standards Department toprovide an annual Service Delivery Plan and a newperformance information return which, in respect ofweights and measures work, is expected to replace theexisting section 70 return. By October 2002, 87 per centof local authorities had provided their Service DeliveryPlans for 2002-03. 41 Audit Commission (1999), Measure for Measure: the best value agenda for trading standards services, London. 42 Accounts Commission (2002), Made to measure?

Each bar represents a single Trading Standards Department.29 part fourREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 4.16 In time the Framework should improve the quality of information local authorities provide on the extent towhich individual pieces of weighing and measuringequipment are accurate, fair and legal. At the time of theNational Audit Office review, the Department wasconsulting on the level and type of information localauthorities would be required to provide. Theinformation obtained will be fed back to localauthorities, consumers and business by the publicationof an annual report 4.17 Currently, the only formal measure of performance of Trading Standards Departments is the Best ValuePerformance Indicator 166 which focuses on the extentto which authorities have complied with a best practicechecklist on environmental health and trading standardsactivity. The Department has recognised the need formore robust measurement of Trading StandardsDepartments in order to drive improvements inperformance and is seeking to develop performancemeasures as part of its ongoing development of theNational Performance Framework. At the time of theNational Audit Office review, the Department wasconsulting local authorities and other stakeholders onthese measures. It has proposed a number ofperformance measures, including one intended tomeasure compliance and the effectiveness ofenforcement activity. This is a composite measure,relating to the full range of trading standards activity,which will not by itself help the Department to identifyeffectiveness and compliance levels with regard toweights and measures. The Department has decided thatit will collect information specifically on weights andmeasures enforcement as well, but was still consultinglocal authorities on the exact information to beincluded. The performance measures will be introducedin April 2003. In time, the Department hopes that theperformance measures established for trading standardswork will be incorporated into the Best Value andCorporate Performance Assessment regimes for localauthorities.4.18 The Department is also working with the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services and the TradingStandards Institute to develop a system of peer review.This is intended to help improve the performance ofTrading Standards Departments by facilitating andunderpinning the necessary audit and review processneeded to ensure the effectiveness of planning. It is alsointended to provide an independent and more in-depthassessment of an authority's performance than ispossible from the performance information return, andto provide advice for performance improvement. SinceFebruary 2002, Good Practice Guides have beenavailable to Trading Standards Departments on a rangeof issues including programmed inspections; consumeradvice; and the investigation of offences. 4.19 Many of the Trading Standards Departments visited by the National Audit Office raised concerns aboutmaintaining the number and skills of Trading StandardsOfficers over the long term. Effective enforcement ofweights and measures legislation is dependent onhaving sufficient Trading Standards Officers in post,given that only they have powers to prosecute offendersunder the legislation. A fall in the numbers seeking totrain to become Trading Standards Officers and the rateat which existing Officers are leaving Trading StandardsDepartments have raised fears that eventually theeffectiveness of trading standards work, including theenforcement of weights and measures legislation, willbe compromised. 4.20 In response, the Department has sought to raise the capabilities of Trading Standards Departments throughsupporting the training and skills development ofTrading Standards Officers, including providingscholarships to cover the cost of initial training towardsthe Diploma in Trading Standards; and helping to fundthe development of distance learning materials by theTrading Standards Institute to support the professionaldevelopment of Trading Standards Officers. In 2002-03,up to \u00a31 million is being made available in scholarshipsand \u00a3500,000 for the development of distance learningmaterials; as part of the Modernisation Fund (providing\u00a310 million in 2002-03) set up by the Department toraise the standard of consumer protection.30appendixAppendixStudy methodology The main aspects of our methodology were: Semi-structured interviews We held semi-structured interviews with key staff in the Department and the Laboratory to establish theirrespective roles in the regulation of weights andmeasures; and gain a better understanding of the systemof control provided by the legislation and itsenforcement. We also attended part of the 2002 AnnualReview of the Legal Metrology Programme 2002-05 togain an understanding of the process by which theProgramme was monitored and assessed. In addition, we met with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to discuss the overall central-localgovernment framework within which TradingStandards Department operate. Analysis of local authority enforcement data We analysed available section 70 returns for the years1998-99, 1999-00 and 2000-01 to identify variations inthe level and results of enforcement activity bothbetween types of local authorities and betweenauthorities of the same type. Visits to Trading Standards Departments To understand the relevance and importance of theenforcement of weights and measures legislation at thelocal level, we visited the following local authorityTrading Standards Departments:These local authorities were chosen after discussions with the Department, the Laboratory, the TradingStandards Institute and the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services. The grouprepresents a mix of local authorities which were broadlytypical (but not statistically representative) of thecircumstances in which Trading Standards Departmentsoperate. During each visit we undertook semi-structuredinterviews to explore a range of issues including thenature of, and approach to, weights and measuresenforcement activity; how risks were assessed andpriorities set; the relevance and enforceability of currentweights and measures legislation; partnershiparrangements with other local authorities; and the roleof the Department and the Laboratory in supportinglocal weights and measures enforcement work. Contacts with key stakeholders As well as visiting a number of Trading StandardsDepartments, we met with the Audit Commissionabout its inspection work on Trading StandardsDepartments; and held semi-structured interviews withthe following organisations to seek their views on theextent to which current legislation has kept pace withtechnological developments and trading practices; therole of the Department and the Laboratory in settingand overseeing the regulatory framework; and theeffectiveness of local enforcement: Bath and North East Somerset Council London Borough of CroydonDurham County CouncilEssex County CouncilGlasgow City CouncilLincolnshire County CouncilNorth East Lincolnshire CouncilSandwell Metropolitan Borough CouncilSurrey County CouncilSwansea City and County CouncilBritish Beer and Pub AssociationBritish Retail ConsortiumConfederation of British IndustryFood and Drink FederationForecourt Equipment Authority of Regulatory Metropolitan UniversityPetrol Retailers AssociationTrading Standards InstituteUnited Kingdom Weighing FederationREGULATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES "}
