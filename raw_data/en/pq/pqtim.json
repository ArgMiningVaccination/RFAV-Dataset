Summary of the pr oject: Study is ongoing.Annual Report 2018-19 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences 1115.3 Systematic Review Pr ojects on Ayurveda Interventions in Major Disease areas (SRP-AI) - An Initiative under CCRAS-IMR A systematic review summarizes the results of available carefully designed healthcare studies (controlled trials) and provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. Judgments may be made about the evidence and inform recommendations for healthcare. These reviews are complicated and depend largely on what clinical trials are available, how they were carried out (the quality of the trials) and the health outcomes that were measured. Review authors pool numerical data about the effects of the treatment through a process called meta-analyses. Then authors assess the evidence for any benefits or harms from those treatments. In this way, systematic reviews are designed to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current evidence relevant to a research question. For example, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials are key to the practice of evidence-based medicine, and a review of existing studies is often quicker and cheaper than embarking on a new study. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Review (CDSR) has the largest collection of Systematic reviews as a part of the Cochrane library. Before starting a Systematic Review, a protocol is mandatory, as it helps to reduce the bias during the review. PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) is an agency under the National Institute of Health Research that registers the protocol for a systematic review on different topics. Wherein a register number is provided for each protocol once it accepted for registration. This enhances the credibility of the review and prevents the duplication of work. A Systematic Review of the efficacy of Ayurveda intervention will help in an in-depth analysis of the use of Ayurveda to treat a condition for which the treatment modality appeared to demonstrate some efficacy. The unique advantage of Quantitative analysis (Meta-analysis) is increased power and precision in estimating effects and risks particularly relevant to the need of drug manufacturers. In the view of the above, Council has taken initiative as a short term grant of nine months under CCRAS-IMR scheme for initiation of projects for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis on Efficacy and Safety of Ayurveda interventions in major diseases/conditions where Ayurveda has strength. The Council has sanctioned 25 Systematic Review projects so far under the guidance of the Program Officer Dr.B.C.S.Rao, A.D.(Ay). Dr.Azeem Ahmad, R.O.(Ay) and Dr.Sumeet Goel, R.O.(Ay) are coordinating as Nodal Officers for these projects. The title and status of the projects are given below: Table - 51: Status of projects S.

Development and validation of Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/ Scale bAC k GROUND : Ayurveda gives emphasis on the personalized approach of treatment for patients as it believes that every individual is unique having specific constitution vis-\u00e0-vis Prakriti. The determination of Prakriti has significant importance in both healthy and unhealthy states which can be applied clinically in diagnosis, treatment (for deciding appropriate drug, dose, duration, diet and life style) and prognosis of the disease as well as for promotion of health by following daily and seasonal regimens according to Prakriti. Looking at the emerging global popularity of Ayurveda, the Council has developed a standardized Prakriti assessment questionnaire which can encompass the minute details of features/ characteristics of a person as described in Ayurvedic Classics with rationality, reliability and validity in consultation with eminent experts of Ayurveda, biostatistician, clinical psychologists etc through multicenter study. The Standard Operative Procedures (SoPs) for capturing each and every predictor for assessment of Prakriti has been developed and documented in the form of Manual of Standard Operative Procedures (SoPs). For the easy application of the scale, user friendly Ayur Prakriti Web Portal (Standardized Prakriti Assessment Scale) has also been designed. The work done during the reporting period: The project has been completed. Following activities have been carried out during the reporting period.1. The 'Manual of Standard Operative procedures for Prakriti Assessment' and 'Ayur Prakriti Assessment Web Portal' Yesso Naik , Hon'ble MoS(IC), Ministry of AYUSH on 28th April 2018 on the occasion of ' n ational Consultative Meet on Intra AYUSH Collaboration held on 28th - 29th April, 2018'at A.P.Shinde Symposium Hall, ICAR, NASC Complex, Pusa, New Delhi. 2. The questionnaire was subjected to Confirmatory Factor Analysis using PCA (Principle Component Analysis) as a further step of validation on the basis of which reduction of items from the questionnaire was carried out. An expert group meeting was convened on 28 th -29th May, 2018 to appraise the same in which the Predictors which were very -very important clinically and have reliable responses and definite outcomes were included in the questionnaire. Considering the importance of Gunas in deciding the preventive and therapeutic measures, the Gunas responsible for each predictor were also discussed in detail and documented. 3. The Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire /Scale vis-a-vis Ayur Prakriti Assessment Web Portal was subjected to clinical validation with Physician's Perspective at 10 selected institutes on 10 cases at each institute. An inter-rater agreement was assessed in comparison to the Prakriti examined by a renowned physician with 8-10 years' clinical experience. The data was analyzed for agreement. The Prakriti of 20 Ayurveda Doctors was also assessed. The Doctors were instructed to assess their Prakriti as per their methodology before the assessment of their Prakriti by Ayur Prakriti Assessment Web Portal. The data obtained from the two assessments was analyzed. Based on the analysis it was observed that a few predictors need to be retained and few to be removed.Annual Report 2018-19 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences 1174. The final version of Prakriti Assessment Scale and Ayur Prakriti Assessment Web Portal was appraised to the expert group in a meeting organized on 28th December 2018 at CCRAS Hqrs. New Delhi. 5.

Free distribution of medicines will also be done for various prevailing disease conditions. Also the individual health screening of the people of the areas/ villages coming for treatment will be done. SRP is likely to improve significantly the Council's outreach in terms of planning and implementation of the various programmes of Public Health Research. Aims and objectives:- 1.

No. Name of the Institute Name of Diseases in Ayurvedic Sciences 1957.5 Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with National Programme for Prevention and control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) kills 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally. Every year, 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; over 85% of these \"premature\" deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, followed by Cancer (9 million), respiratory diseases (3.9 million), and Diabetes (1.6 million).These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths. It is projected that globally NCDs will account for nearly 44 million deaths in 2020 (Global status report on non-communicable diseases 2010). Keeping in view the mortality rate due to NCDs the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2008, to prevent the projected increase in the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases, on pilot basis and thereafter it was launched in 21 states during the year 2010-12 with the aim of health promotion; prevention and control of NCDs through early screening. The leading cause of NCDs is lifestyle changes and Ayurveda, the age old indigenous system of health care primarily focuses on prevention of diseases through life style modifications. Therefore it was felt that AYUSH (Ayurveda) interventions (based on the fundamental concepts) can play a pivotal role in prevention, control and treatment of NCDs. With this view, several meetings were held under the chairmanship of Secretary, AYUSH, Ministry of AYUSH and officials of Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and arrived at a conclusion to initiate the programme \"Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with NPCDCS programme\" through CCRAS Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat), Gaya (Bihar) to prevent and control the projected increase in the burden of NCDs through early screening. Therefore, in view of the above, Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani & Homoeopathy) for promotion of health and prevention of diseases has been made one of the mandates of NPCDCS programme. Therefore the aforesaid programme was launched at 3 districts viz. Surendranagar (Gujarat), Bhilwara (Rajasthan) and Gaya (Bihar) having Dte.GHS would provide support for basic laboratory investigations through its CHCs and requisite support (transportation etc.) for organizing camps. The main objectives of this programme are as under: Integration of Ayurveda to the existing healthcare system for promotion, prevention and control of non-communicable diseases through NPCDCS program. Early diagnosis of NCDs for management through food & life style changes through principles of Ayurveda. In chronic cases, to reduce drug dependency through Ayurveda, Yoga practices and Lifestyle changes. As an adjuvant therapy to reduce complications and associated symptoms.

GHS, Nirman Bhawan, an outside expert from Reputed Institution and representatives from District authorities to evaluate the modus operandi of the programme and also to evaluate the work done during particular quarter, so that corrective measures, if any, may be suggested to the implementing authorities. Further, it helps in assessing that how economically resources or inputs (such as funds, expertise and time) are being converted in to results. In view of the above, Quarterly Monitoring visits were conducted at Bhilwara (Rajasthan), & Gaya (Bihar) on 17 th - 19th May 2018, 19th -21st November 2018 respectively. The Quarterly Monitoring Committee in all the districts found that the services provided in AYUSH-NPCDCS Clinics were instrumental in achieving the goals of lowering the burden of NCDs in these areas and also create awareness to protect the health by adopting Ayurvedic intervention, Lifestyle modifications and Yoga practices. The Committee appreciated the work done so far and supposed that this programme will be success with visible improvement, if sufficient basic facilities are provided.

In the beginning of reporting year 10 musk deer (07 males + 03 females) were in the farm. With the birth of 2 female fawns the total present population of the musk deer is 12 (7 males and 5 females). During the reporting period 5.71gm musk was obtained from live animal and 46.61gm musk was obtained from the pod of dead animal. It is reported that the musk deer thrash on fodder in the form of soft leaves, which changes according to season i.e. round the year they don't rely on one type of fodder & changes according to change in season and availability. Fodder in the form of soft leaves in adequate amount like soft leaves and flower of Rododendron sps. was provided. During rainy season all the deer showed the symptoms of alopecia i.e. falling of hair, possible reason may be deficiency of mineral. During heavy rainfall loss of micro-minerals from fodder leaves observed, though it was compensated with mineral mixture, provided with concentrate feed but still same symptoms exist.Annual Report 2018-19 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences 2099.5.
