This healthy balance can be disturbed if any one factor such as diet, exercise, environment, sleep and stress factors go out of the way. In turn, a slight hormone imbalance can become the underlying issue for a number of health concerns, including irregular periods, acne, PCOS, thyroid disorders, and chronic fatigue. Seed cycling is a one of the natural remedies that is believed to balance hormones by regulating the hormone estrogen in the first half (follicular phase) of your menstrual cycle and the hormone progesterone in the second half (luteal phase). It helps in regulating periods and help in reducing acne, treating polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and infertility, and easing symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, fatigue, and mood swings. Some of the research and articles also assert that it can improve thyroid hormone levels, improve hair health, promote weight loss, reduces water retention and cellulite. HOW TO START SEED CYCLING FOR HORMONE BALANCE? Talking about the menstrual cycle, the first 14 days of your menstrual cycle makes up the follicular phase, while the following 14 days make up the luteal phase. When your hormone levels are balanced, estrogen rises during the first half of your cycle whereas progesterone levels rise (while estrogen levels slowly decline) during the second half of your cycle. An imbalance between estrogen and progesterone can contribute to PMS symptoms, menstrual cramps, acne, short luteal phases, anovulation, irregular cycles, and amenorrhea. DAYS 1-14 OF YOUR CYCLE (OR MENSTRUATION TO OVULATION) \u00b7 1-2 tablespoons ground flax seeds \u00b7 1-2 tablespoons ground pumpkin seeds DAYS 15-28 OF YOUR CYCLE (OR OVULATION TO MENSTRUATION) \u00b7 1-2 tablespoons ground sunflower seeds \u00b7 1-2 tablespoons ground sesame seeds THE NUTRITIONAL COMPONENTS IN SEEDS LIGNANS Flax seeds are considered phytoestrogens, which have a weak estrogen-like effect in the body. This naturally supports healthy estrogen production. Flax seeds are unique in that they also contain nutritional components called lignans which can help to bind excess estrogen. Research shows that flax seeds help in lengthening the luteal phase, improving ovulation and reducing common PMS symptoms such as breast pain and cramping. Sesame seeds also contain lignans which help to block excess estrogen during the second phase of your menstrual cycle when progesterone rises. Research shows that sesame seeds are beneficial for postmenopausal women by improving blood lipids, antioxidants, and sex hormones. ZINC Pumpkin and sesame seeds both contain high levels of zinc. This mineral helps to improve the formation of the corpus luteum in the uterus. The corpus luteum is responsible for producing progesterone and stimulates the uterus to thicken in preparation for potential implantation. OMEGA-3S, OMEGA-6S + VITAMIN E Both flax and pumpkin seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s promote blood flow to the uterus, increase progesterone secretion, and help maintain healthy cell membranes. In addition, Vitamin E has been linked to reducing PMS symptoms. Research also shows that Vitamin E, omega-3s and omega-6s found in pumpkin, sesame, sunflower, and flax seeds are essential for hormone production and follicle function. SELENIUM Sunflower seeds, high in the trace mineral selenium, supports estrogen detoxification in the liver. This helps reduce excess estrogen during the luteal phase when estrogen declines and progesterone rises. Though seed cycling may or may not balance hormones, including seeds in your diet boosts your intake of vitamins and minerals and is associated with a lower risk of certain cancers, as well as reduced inflammation, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. Bottom Line These seeds are natural source of minerals and phytochemicals. These will help you heal naturally and may be time consuming. Some serious complications due to hormonal imbalances should be notified to a physician for further diagnosis and cure. "}
