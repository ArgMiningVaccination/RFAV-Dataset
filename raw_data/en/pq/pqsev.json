The incidence increases with age, and the median age at onset of MM is approximately 70 years, with approximately two thirds of patients aged older than 65 years. Although survival from the time of diagnosis of MM has improved since 2000 , the prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM) following prior exposure to all three MM drug classes is poor , and the remaining therapeutic options are limited (Dimopoulos et al. 2021; Cowan et al. 2022). Most of these patients have triple -class refractory disease, and many have been exposed to all five drugs that have demonstrated single- agent effectiveness : bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, penta -exposed patients). Historically , this patient population achieved objective response rates ( ORR) of approximately 30%, median progression- free survival ( PFS) of approximately 3 to 6 months, and median overall survival ( OS) of approximately 6 to 12 months (Gandhi et al. 2019). With the present application, Tecvayli has been proposed for the treatment of RRMM following prior exposure to all three MM drug classes, based on the results of Study MajesTEC -1 (64007957MMY1001). re Phase 1/2 study of Tecvayli administered as monotherapy to adult patients with triple- class exposed RRMM who had received at least 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. While the Phase 1 part focused on dose escalation and selection of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), the pivotal Phase 2 part focused on investigating the efficacy and safety of Tecvayli in the proposed patient population.

Teclistamab is a heterodimer consisting of two different heavy chains (HC) and two different light chains (LC), joined by disulfide bonds. Amino acid substitutions in the CH3 domain of one parental antibody's HC the hinge region and suppress es FcR bin ding. With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3+ T cells in close proximity to BCMA+ cells, resulting in T cell activation and subsequent lysis and death of BCMA+ cells. The parental monospecific monoclonal antibodies, anti -BCMA and anti -CD3 are each produced separately by mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. The generation, characteri sation and control of the host cell lines , and the establishment of the recombinant master and working cell banks used for production of anti -BCMA and anti -CD3 parental antibodies are described in sufficient detail. The upstream manufacturing process of both parental antibodies uses suspension cells and serum - free media. The parental antibodies are secreted into the culture medium and separated from cell debris by filtration steps followed by chromatographic purification. Formation of the bispecific t eclistamab is conducted through reduction and oxidation of the parental monospecific monoclonal antibodies. The purification process comprises sever al chromatographic and filtration steps as well as virus inactivation and virus retention filtration. The manufacturing process of teclistamab is validated with several consecutive batches, and the data demonstrated a consistent production and an efficient removal of impurities. The specifications for drug substance release and stability include relevant tests and acceptance criteria, e.g. for identity, purity and impurities, quantity, and potency. Specifications are based on clinical experience, batch analysis data, stability data, and are in conformance with current compendial or regulatory guidelines. All specific analytical methods are described in sufficient detail and are fully validated. Teclistamab drug substance is stored frozen. The established shelf life of the drug substance is justified by the results of ICH -conform stability studies. 4.2 Drug product The teclistamab drug product is supplied as a sterile liquid in a vial presentation for subcutaneous administration. Two different presentations are available, one containing 90 mg/ml teclistamab and the other containing 10 mg/ml teclistamab, and the 10 mg/ml presentation is intended for the step -up dosing regimen only. Each 10 mg/mL drug product vial contains 30 mg of teclistamab in a 3.0 mL nominal fill volume, and each 90 mg/mL teclistamab drug product vial contains 153 mg of teclistamab in a 1.7 mL nominal fill volume. Both presentations are for single- use only and are preservative- free. The f ormulation is an aqueous buffered solution of pH 5.2 containing an acetic buffer, EDTA, sucrose, and polysorbate 20. All excipients comply with the European Pharmacopoeia. The manufacturing process of the finished drug product consists of thawing, compounding and dilution steps, sterile filtration, aseptic filling/stoppering/sealing, inspection, label ling and secondary packaging. Process validation studies were conducted at the commercial scale. The manufacturing process of drug substance and drug product include adequate control measures to prevent contamination and maintain control with regard to adventitious agents safety. The release and stability specifications were established as part of an integrated control strategy and are derived from compendial guidelines, product and process knowledge, and statistical analysis of 10 and 90 mg/mL DP release and stability data. They include relevant tests and limits, e.g. for identity, appearance, colou r of solution, pH, turbidity, osmolality, purity and impurities tests, potency assay, protein concentration, extractable volume, particulate matter, sterility, container closure 9 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 integrity and bacterial endotoxins. All non- compendial methods are fully validated in accordance with current regulatory guidance. The drug product is stored at 2 - 8\u00b0C protected from light. The claimed shelf life of 18 months is justified based on ICH -conform stability studies. Compatibility studies of drug product with syringes made of polycarbonate and polypropylene demonstrated that the physical and biochemical integrity was retained for up to 20 hours at 2 -8\u00b0C or at room temperature. 4.3 Quality conclusions Satisfactory and consistent quality of drug substance and drug product has been demonstrated. 10 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 5 Nonclinical aspects A limited nonclinical programme was conducted for teclistamab, in line with ICH S6(R1) and ICH S9. 5.1 Pharmacology In vitro biochemical studies demonstrated teclistamab binding to human B -cell maturation antigen (hBCMA) nM. Teclistamab bound cBCMA- expressing CHO cells with an EC 50 of 23 nM, hBCMA+ multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines with EC 50s in the low nanomolar range, and primary bone marrow mononuclear cells from MM patients. Kds for CD3 binding were similar for human and for cynomolgus monkey T cells ( 28 nM and 38 nM respectively ). Teclistamab had a 2 - to 20 -fold higher potency for hBCMA - than for cBCMA -mediated killing of CHO cells in the presence of human T cells. Teclistamab showed potent T c ell-mediated activity against hBCMA+ MM cell lines, bone marrow mononuclear cells from MM patients, and in whole blood of normal donors spiked with an MM cell line with EC 50 values in the lower nanomolar range. Binding and sequence alignment data did not suggest any activity on BCMA and/or CD3 of rodents or rabbits. Studies with proliferation- inducing ligand ( APRIL) and B -cell activating factor ligand s of BCMA, and soluble BCMA (sB CMA), did not suggest any clinically relevant interference wit h teclistamab activity. In contrast, teclistamab may interfere with BAFF- and APRIL- mediated BCMA signalling. In a tumour model NSG mice, teclistamab inhibited tumour growth 79% at intraperitoneal doses 0.5 mg/kg. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not conducted, which is considered acceptable. Tissue cross- reactivity studies with cynomolgus monkey and human tissues did not indicate any binding to reproductive organs or cardiac, lung, brain, peripheral nerve, or spinal cord tissues. Teclistamab , as an IgG4 with a modified Fc region and reduced Fc receptor binding, is expected to have a reduced Fc effector function. Therefore, no functional studies were conducted, which is acceptable. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system function was assessed in the pivotal cynomolgus monkey 5- week repeat -dose toxicity study, in line with ICH S6(R1). No effects were noted at the highest administered dose. 5.2 Pharmacokinetics Analytical methods were appropriately validated for the detection of teclistamab and ADA s in cynomolgus monkey blood. Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic profiles were evaluated in two toxicology studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. After single and repeated dosing , C max and AUC last increased approximately dose- proportionally over the dose range of 0.1- 30 mg/kg/day. There were no gender differences in exposure, and no accumulation > 2 -fold occurred after repeated dosing. Traditional distribution, metabolism, excretion, and drug interaction studies were not performed, in line with ICH recommendations. ADAs were detected in the majority of animals in the pivotal 5- week toxicology study. Exposure was decreased in only 7 out of 21 ADA -positive animals. However, the possibility that residual teclistamab interfered with ADA detection could not be excluded but, overall, the validity of the study was not considered to be affected by ADAs. Immunogenicity in clinical studies was low ( 0.5% patients with neutralising antibodies). 5.3 Toxicology The c ynomolgus monkey was selected for the toxicology studies based on the protein sequence homology of > 90% for cBCMA and hBMCA and on demonstrated pharmacological activity. 11 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 clinical weekly dosing scheme was used. Doses were administered intravenously (IV) in contrast to the clinical subcutaneou s (SC) route , as this was the initially planned clinical administration route. Exposures upon IV administration are expected to be similar to , or exceed, exposures after SC administration, and the divergent administration routes are not considered to affect the validity of the toxicology study. A non -GLP study with single doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg and a pivotal study with weekly doses of 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg for 5 weeks did not show any teclistamab- related effects. Although all doses resulted in exposures above the pharmacological effective in vitro concentration for cytotoxicity, no pharmacological effects were noted. This is probably due to the lower binding affinity to cBMCA compared to hBCMA , and the lower BCMA target expression in cynomolgus monkey compared to MM patients. Binding of teclistamab to CD3 was shown by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, which however did not result in T cell activation or changes in the number of immune cells or cytokine levels. The highest dose level of 30 mg/kg was considered the NOEL, associated with exposures 43- fold C max and 22- fold AUC tau at human steady - state exposure at 1.5 mg/kg. Considering the ~36 -fold lower affinity of teclistamab to cBCMA compared to hBCMA, the toxicology study and the exposure multiples are not considered to inform appropriately on safety in patients. The lack of effects in healthy monkeys is in contrast to the strong pharmacology -related adverse effects in humans ( e.g., cytokine release syndrome associated with cardiovascular and central nervous system effects, hypogammaglobulina emia, neutropenia and increased infection risk). Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive and development toxicology studies were not conducted, in line with ICH S6(R1) recommendations. As teclistamab induces T cell activation and cytokine release, pregnancy may be adversely affected. Appropriate recommendations for contraception, pregnancy, and breast -feeding are included in the information for healthcare professionals. A local tolerance study in rabbits with SC administration showed slight erythema at the injection site, a common site reaction in humans. Teclistamab was not haemolytic and did not induce serum coagulation or precipitation in blood of normal donors. In whole blood from normal donors, teclistamab induced low levels of TNF- at 3 ng/mL, and of IL-8 and IFN - at 82 ng/mL in a dose- dependent manner. Cytokine release syndrome is a common adverse effect in patients , and appropriate measures are recommended in the information for healthcare professionals. Teclistamab is indicated only for adults. Juvenile studies are not required. There are no concerns with regard to the excipients or impurities. An environmental risk from an antibody such as teclistamab is not expected. The RMP appropriately summarises the nonclinical data for teclistamab and the risks associated with the class of T cell engagers. 5.4 Nonclinical conclusions Overall, the pharmacological properties of teclistamab were sufficiently characterised in nonclinical studies. The toxicology study including safety pharmacology endpoints conducted in the cynomolgus monkey did not show any biological or associated toxicological effects. Effective exposure levels were similar to the clinical exposure, which is considered acceptable for the requested indication. 12 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 6 Clinical and clinical pharmacology aspects 6.1 Clinical pharmacology Bioanalytics: Validated bioanalytical assays were used for the determination of teclistamab serum concentrations and for the assessment of immunogenicity (presence of ADAs and neutrali sing antibodies). Biopharmaceutics : The d rug product intended for the market was used in the clinical study. Pharmacokinetics: The pertinent pharmacokinetic (PK) / pharmacodynamic information in support of this application was derived from the MajesTEC -1 study. For PK and immunogenicity data, the data cutoff was 09 August 2021. The available PK data were analysed in a popPK analysis. A two -compartment model with parallel time-independent and time- dependent clearance pathways was selected as the final population pharmacokinetic model, which best described the observed teclistamab concentration data. The time- independent clearance component is thought to reflect the endogenous catabolic processes of IgG degradation. The time -dependent clearance component corresponds to the decrease in drug clearance as disease status improves over time, which is thought to be related to tumou r burden or target amount. None of the factors investigated in the popPK analysis (i.e. age, sex, body weight, race, region, ethnicity, creatinine clearance, albumin concentration, renal impairment [mild, moderate or severe], hepatic impairment [mild], baseline soluble BCMA, bone marrow percent plasma cells, plasmacytoma, ECOG status, ISS/revised ISS stage, type of myeloma [IgG vs non -IgG], number of prior lines of therapy, prior use of daratumumab, prior use of anti -PD1/anti -PDL1, prior use of anti BCMA treatment, refractor y status, immune response status, and drug product) was identified as having a meaningful effect on teclistamab pharmacokinetic behaviou r. Based on the final popPK model, the volumes of distribution were 4.09 L for the central compartment and 1.29 l for the peripheral compartment. The time- independent clearance was 0.545 l/day. According to non- compartmental analyses, the average half -life of elimination following intravenous administration was 3.8 days. No dedicated studies in patients with renal and hepatic impairment were conducted. The popPK analysis suggested the absence of a meaningful impact of mild hepatic impairment and of mild and moderate renal impairment on teclistamab. The final population pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate concentrati on-time profiles following the RP2D (1.5 mg/kg teclistamab SC administered weekly, with the first treatment dose preceded by step- up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg). Steady state levels were attained in Cycle 3 (the 7th treatment dose; Day 43) following the proposed dosing regimen. Mean accumulation ratios following multiple 1.5 mg/kg SC weekly doses was 2.71- and 3.05 -fold for C max and AUC tau, respectively. Based on available AUC tau values at steady state from all IV and SC weekly dosing cohorts, mean bioavailability following SC weekly administration for the treatment dose was 69%. Immunogenicity: The teclistamab- mediated immunogenicity potential was low. None of the patients treated with the recommended Tecvayli dosing developed antibodies against tec listamab. 6.2 Dose finding and dose recommendation The registrational treatment dose of Tecvayli monotherapy (1.5 mg/kg SC administered weekly, with the first treatment dose preceded by two step- up doses of 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg) was selected based on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data available from the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the pivotal Study MajesTEC -1. This dosage corresponds to the RP2D used in all patients of the pivotal Phase 2 part of Study MajesTEC- 1. 13 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 The a vailable evidence suggest s that efficacy in terms of ORR and time -to-event endpoints , such as duration of response (DOR), PFS and OS, might be comparable at RP2D and lower dosages, e.g. if Phase 1 results of the RP2D cohort (N=40) and 0.72 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) weekly cohort (N=15) are compared. However, the number of patients and the range of concentrations studied at non- RP2D dosages are too low and the time-to-event endpoint is too immature to draw valid conclusions. Even though a positive exposure- efficac y relationship was reported in the 72 Phase 1 SC subjects (28 at <RP2D, 40 at RP2D, and 4 at >RP2D), this might have been biased by lumping the 15 patients on 0.72 mg/kg SC weekly together with lower dosages into the <RP2D cohort. Similarly, although safet y does not appear to differ across investigated dosages, the number of patients and the range of concentrations studied at lower dosages are too low to confirm less toxicity when Tecvayli dosage is reduced. This uncertainty is of particular relevance as approximately two- thirds of patients treated with Tecvayli SC at RP2D experienced at least one treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) leading to cycle delay or dose interruption, and substantial proportions of patients reported TEAEs , including neurological TEAEs and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Moreover, it is noted that the use of lower step- up doses of Tecvayli had been implemented to mitigate the risk of CRS. Another relevant aspect regarding dose finding is that patients of the pivotal Study MajesTE C-1 could reduce dosing frequency from weekly dosing in case of response. The results of the requested additional analyses suggest that extending the dosing interval to every -2-week dosing (Q2W) after achieving the specified responses - PR or better over at least 4 cycles in Phase 1, CR or better for at least 6 months in Phase 2 - may not negatively affect efficacy in terms of DOR, PFS, and OS. In many instances, the efficacy results were even numerically better in patients who had their dosing interval extended to Q2W, especially in Phase 1 patients treated with R2PD. However, as assignments were not randomi sed and patient numbers were small, data need to be interpreted cautiously. Still, predicted median trough levels after Q2W dosing are expected to be higher than the maximum EC90 value, which had been defined as the minimum trough level of Tecvayli to achieve efficacy. Following Swissmedic's request, the limited evidence and uncertainties regarding dose finding and selection have been adequately reflected in the information for healthcare professionals . 6.3 Efficacy The pivotal Phase 2 part of Study MajesTEC -1 was comprised of two cohorts of patients with triple- class exposed RRMM who had received at least 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. While Cohort A excluded prior treatment with any BCMA -targeted therapy, Cohort C was to include only patients who had also received an anti -BCMA treatment with CAR -T cells or an ADC and was designed to investigate whether patients with RRMM that progressed on prior BCMA -directed therapy (CAR T - cells or ADC) could respond to subsequent BCMA -directed therapy with Tecvayli. Several eligibility restrictions have been considered not representative for the targeted population, which is comprised of a heavily pre- treated elderly population in a very advanced disease stage and with significa nt comorbidities. This regards the exclusionary limits used for hypercalc aemia, renal insufficiency, and ana emia as well as the limitation to performance status of ECOG 0 and 1 - see information for healthcare professionals . The s tudy drug was to be administered to subjects until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All subjects were to receive premedication prior to each step- up dose and the first treatment dose of Tecvayli , including steroids, antihistamines, and antipyretics. Additionally, subjects who experienced Grade 2 CRS or systemic administration -related reactions (sARRs) were required to receive dexamethasone prior to the next dose of Tecvayli , and subjects who experienced any grade CRS or sARRs were required to receive the antihistamine and antipyretic prior to at least the next dose of Tecvayli . Dose delay was the primary method for managing toxicities related to Tecvayli , and no patients treated at pivotal RP2D underwent dose reduction. 14 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Disease evaluations were to be performed at screening and prior to study drug administration at each cycle (28- day in Phase 2), using a central laboratory. Radiographic assessments of disease status were to occur every 12 weeks. During treatment, and before disease progression was confirmed, x-rays or CT scans were to be performed locally, whenever clinically indicated based on symptoms, to document progression. Bone marrow samples to assess for plasma cell percentage and clonality were to be analy sed locally; bone marrow samples to assess for minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity were to be analysed centrally. Disease evaluations were to be continued until disease progression, even after discontinuation of study therapy. An Independent Review Committee (IRC) was to perform an independent review of data from participants treated at the RP2D with Tecvayli and provide an independent determination of response / progressive disease (PD) based on the 2016 international myeloma working group (IMWG ) consensus criteria in combination with clinical judgement. In the pivotal Phase 2 part of Study MajesTEC- 1, the primary objective was to evaluate efficacy of Tecvayli at the RP2D, with IRC -assessed ORR as the primary endpoint. There were multiple secondary efficacy endpoints including DOR, time to response (TTR), PFS, OS, and MRD -negativity rate. Given the absence of a control arm, sample size calculations and type I error control, these endpoints have been considered explorator y. All treated Phase 2 patients from both Cohort A and Cohort C (N=125 and 38, respectively) have been considered the primary population for efficacy (in total N=163), while Phase 1 data were supportive only. The Swissmedic Clinical Assessment has focused on the primary analysis that was based on the pre- specified primary data cut -off (DCO) 07 September 2021. However, because time- to-event endpoints such as DOR, PFS and OS were immature at this time point, the focus for their assessment has been on the subsequently submitted data from the latest DCO 16 March 2022. As of DCO 07 September 2021, approximately 40% of Phase 2 Cohort A and Cohort C patients had discontinued the study drug, most commonly due to progressive disease (23% and 29%, respectively) follow ed by death (7% and 10.5%, respectively). Approximately 26% and 18% of Phase 2 Cohort A and Cohort C patients, respectively, had discontinued study participation, most commonly due to death (23% and 18%, respectively). Duration of exposure to Tecvayli and follow -up were short in the primary efficacy population (N=163). These patients had a median duration of exposure to Tecvayli of less than 6 months, with only 38% (62/163 patients) exposed to Tecvayli for 6 months or longer, while median duration of follow -up did not exceed 6.5 months at DCO 07 September 2021. Data updates increased the median duration of exposure and follow -up to approximately 7.5 months and 1 year, respectively, which is still short and was associated with insufficiently mature time -to-event endpoints such as OS. The m edian age of Phase 2 Cohort A and Cohort C patients was 64 years with, in total , 13% (15% and 5%, respectively) being at least 75 years of age, which is younger than one would expect from an MM population. The majority of Phase 2 patients were male (in total 58%; 56% and 63%, respectively), White (in total 82%; 80% and 90%, respectively), and performance status was approximately 70% ECOG 1 vs. 30% ECOG 0. IgG was the most common immunoglobulin isotype in approximately 56% of Phase 2 patients (59% and 47% of Cohort A and Cohort C patients, respectively, followed by light chain MM in approximately 24% (20% and 37%, respectively). The median time from diagnosis of multiple myeloma to 1 st study dose was 6.2 years (range: 0.8 to 23) and 6.5 years (range: 1.1 to 24), respectively. Extramedullary plasmacytoma at baseline was present in 19% of Phase 2 patients (16% and 29% of Cohort A and Cohort C patients, respectively), and approximately 12% had 60% or more plasma cells in the bone marrow (biopsy or aspirate). High- risk cytogenetics was present in 26% (24% and 32%, respectively), most frequently del(17p) and t(4;14). Revised ISS ( R-ISS) staging was Stage I in 22% (23.5% vs. 16%, respectively), Stage II in approximately 70%, respectively, and Stage III in 10% (8% vs. 13.5%, 15 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Almost all the treated Phase 2 Cohort A and Cohort C patients (161 out of 163) had received at least 3 prior lines of MM therapy; the median number of lines of prior therapy was 5 (range: 2 to 14) overall, and 5 (range: 2 to 14) in Cohort A and 6 (range: 3 to 14) in Cohort C, respectively. All 163 Phase 2 patients (100%) were triple- class (72% and 79%, respectively) , were penta -exposed (at least 2 PIs, at least 2 IMiDs, and at least 1 anti- CD38 monoclonal antibody). In addition, all patients in Cohort C had received prior anti -BCMA therapy, approximately 70% ADC and 40% CAR T -cells. Triple -class refractoriness was reported for 79% of Phase 2 patients (77% and 84% of Cohort A and Cohort C patients, respectively), and penta- refractoriness for 28% (27% and 32%, respectively). In addition, approximately two thirds of pat ients in Cohort C were reportedly refractory to any anti -BCMA therapy, 58% to ADC and 13% to CAR T - cells. Overall, 90% of all Phase 2 patients were classified as refractory to last line therapy (92% and 84%, respectively). Subsequent anti- myeloma therapy was allowed at the discretion of the investigator after disease progression was established per the IMWG criteria. Overall, 22% of Phase 2 patients received subsequent systemic anti- myeloma therapy or radiotherapy (21% and 26% in Cohort A and Cohort C, respectively). The most frequent therapies were glucocorticoids (overall 15%; 13% and 21%, respectively), nitrogen mustard analogues (approximately 10% both cohorts), mostly cyclophosphamide, proteasome inhibitors 11%, respectively), mostly doxorubicin. Primary endpoint The b est IRC -assessed ORR ( partial response (PR) or better) in the pooled Phase 2 population of Cohort A and Cohort C (N=163) was 57% (95%CI 49, 65) using IMWG 2016 criteria based on data from DCO 07 September 2021, with 20% achieving responses of CR or better (s tringent CR + CR). In Cohort A (N=125), the best IRC -assessed ORR was 62% (95%CI 53, 70), with 21% achieving responses of CR or better. In Cohort C (N=38), the best IRC -assessed ORR was 42% (95%CI 26, 59), with 18% achieving responses of CR or better. Results of sensitivity analyses for ORR were consistent with the primary analysis for Cohort A and Cohort C. Secondary endpoints Duration of response (DOR) Based on an update as of DCO 16 March 2022, the event rate among the 98 responders in the pooled Phase 2 population (N=163) of Cohort A (78 responders) and Cohort C (20 responders) was 30% (31% and 25% in Cohort A and Cohort C, respectively). Estimated median DOR was 14.9 months (95% CI 14,9, not estimable) in the pooled Phase 2 population and in Cohort A, while it was not estimable in Cohort C (lower limit of 95% CI 10.5 months). The probability of responders to remain in response at 6 months was approximately 87% (90% and 79%, respectively) and, at 12 months , 66% (67% and 64%, respectively). Progression- free survival (PFS) Based on an update as of DCO 16 March 2022, maturity in the pooled Phase 2 population (N=163) was 53% (51% and 61% in Cohort A and Cohort C, respectively). Estimated median PFS was approximately 10 months, but differed between cohorts and was shorter in Cohort C (10.5 months vs. 4.5 months). PFS at 12 months was 43%, and again differed between both cohorts and was lower in Cohort C (46% vs. 32%). Overall survival (OS) Based on an update as of DCO 16 March 2022, overall maturity in the pooled Phase 2 population and the individual Phase 2 cohorts was 42%. Estimated median OS was 16 months in the pooled Phase 2 population, and was similar in Cohort A and Cohort C (16 and 14.4 months, respectively). OS at 12 months was approximately 60%, and again similar in both cohorts (60% and 59%, respectively). 16 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity Approximately 12% / 20% of patients with PR / CR or better had no bone marrow samples for MRD evaluation. In addition, in those who had bone marrow samples, calibration failed in approximately 30%. Thus, MRD results are not robust. 6.4 Safety The focus of the following safety assessment has focused on the subsequently submitted data from the latest DCO 16 March 2022. As of this DCO, all patients treated at RP2D (RP2D/Cohort C; N=203) and all patients treated in the MajesTEC- 1 study (Total MajesTEC -1; N=340) reported at least one TEAE, which w ere judged as drug -related in up to 94% of these patients. The most frequently reported AEs were: Blood and lymphatic system disorders in approximately 90% of disorders and administration site conditions in 75- 80% of patients, including pyrexia (30%), fatigue 30%). and of patients, mainly pneumonia (15%), COVID -19 (15%), and upper respiratory tract infection (10 -15%). Opportunistic infections were reported in 10% of patients treated at RP2D, P neumocystis jirovecii pneumonia being the most common (3%); of note, one fatal case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) was reported. Immune system disorders in 70- 75% of patients, mainly due to CRS (up to 71%); hypogammaglobulina emia (15%). Musculoskeletal and connective of patients, including arthralgia (25%), back pain (15 -20%), bone pain (15 -20%), and pain in extremity (15%). Gastrointestinal disorders in 25%), -15%). Metabolism and nutrition disorders in 55% of patients, including decreased electrolytes (potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium) and decreased appetite in 10- 15%. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders in 50% of patients, including cough (20%) and dyspnoea (10-15%). Nervous system disorders in 45- 50% of patients, mainly headache (25%). Investigations in 35 -40% of patients, including increased liver function test s (ALT, AST, gamma - GT) in 10%. Vascular disorders in 30% of patients, including hypertension in 10%. Grade 3 / 4 TEAEs were reported in up to 94% of patients. The most frequently r eported grade 3 / 4 TEAEs were b lood and lymphatic system disorders in approximately 85% of patients, cytopenias, neutropenia febrile neutropenia. Infections and infestations of grade 3 / 4 occurred in 40% of patients, mainly COVID -19 (10%) and pneumonia (10%). Grade 3 / 4 hypophosphat aemia and hypertension was reported in 8 and 5% of patients, respectively. Serious TEAEs were reported in up to 64% of patients, with serious TEAEs judged as drug -related in more than one quarter of cases. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs were infections and infestations in 35- 40% of patients, mainly COVID -19 (2 -4%), developed serious neutropenia, and although approximately 10% experienced serious CRS , only one CRS event was of grade 3. Serious acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported in 4% of patients (no serious AKI was reported in the \"Non -RP2D\" SC patients), and serious diarrho ea in approximately 3%, however, the incidence of AKI might be confounded by the underlying disease. Overall, 148 of 340 patients (44%) had died as of DCO in Study MajesTEC -1, with a similar overall mortality in patients treated at RP2D (41%). Of the 148 overall deaths, approximately 63% 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 died primarily due to progressive disease (27% of all study patients), whereas approximately 24% (36/148) of patients died primarily due to AEs (12% of all patients treated at RP2D). The corresponding proportions of PD- and AE -related deaths in patients treated and 30% (25/84), respectively (25% and 12% of all patients, respectively). It is of note that COVID -19-related deaths accounted for 38% (21/55) and 44% (15/34) of non- PD-related deaths in all study patients and all patients treated at RP2D, respectively. Grade 5 (fatal) AEs were reported for 13% (44/340) of all study patients, and the incidence was highest in patients treated at RP2D (17%, 34/203) compared with other SC dosages and after IV administration (approximately 7%). Fatal infections were the most prevalent grade 5 AEs (7-8% of all patients), reported in the majority (approximately 70%) of patients who primarily died of grade 5 AEs. The most common fatal infection was COVID -19 (5 -7% of all patients; 75 -80% of all fatal infections), and again the incidence was highest in patients treated at RP2D (7%) as compared to other SC dosages and after IV administration (approximately 2- 3.5%). Other reported grade 5 AEs were unspecific (such as general physical health deterioration), and/or reported in single instances only . As compared to the earlier DC O 07 September 2021, nine new Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in subjects treated at pivotal RP2D who died due to AE (preferred terms: individual COVID -19 cases, PML and hepatic failure were judged by the investigator as possibly or probably related to Tecvayli . Evaluation of death rates is challenging as comparator data are lacking and the underlying disease, might have confounded death causes, especially for infections. Furthermore, differences in death rates between Phase 1 and Phase 2 are confounded by small sample sizes of cohorts as well as differences in duration of exposure / follow -up and safety reporting (Phase 1 vs. Phase 2: grade 5 TEAE reporting of PD -related deaths per investigator discretion vs. requested and TEAE window 100 vs. 30 days). In addition, COVID -19-related deaths are an important contributor to the imbalance observed between Phase 1 and Phase 2 and can, at least partly, be explained by an increased COVID -19 risk during the conduct of Phase 2 compared with Phase 1 that was conducted earlier. Overall, death rates do not raise concern when the expected mortality in this population is considered based on historical data and recently approved drugs for the therapy of late relapses of MM. Except for fatal infections, no specific pattern or signal can be detected for grade 5 AEs based on the available safety data as of DCO 16 March 2022. There was a notable incidence of COVID -19-related deaths in study MajesTEC -1. As of 16 March 2022, approximately 7% (14/203) of all patients treated with Tecvayli at RP2D had died from COVID - 19 infections, which means that more than 40% of patients with treatment -emergent COVID -19 infections died from it, despite almost 60% of these patients having received a COVID -19 vaccination and 10% monoclonal antibodies as prophylaxis. In addition, COVID -19-related deaths accounted for almost half (15/34) of all non- progressive- disease- related deaths and approximately 80% of all fatal infections in this population. Overall, incidences of SARS -CoV-2 infection and COVID -19-related fatality appear to be reasonably consistent with rates that could have been expected based on publicly available data. In addition, subsequently submitted preliminary data from MajesTEC -3 suggest rather lower incidences of SARS -CoV-2 infection (11%) and COVID -19-related fatality (no cases reported by the time of submission). It is of note that three cases of PML have been reported in total in the Tecvayli development program me (N=894, as of 01 July 2022), one of which was in study MajesTEC -1. All three cases were fatal. The estimated incidence of PML is approximately 0.3%. So far, three fatal hepatic events have been reported throughout the Tecvayli development program me for which the involvement of Tecvayli appears probable, i.e. two cases of hepatic failure unrelated to disease progression and one case of hepatitis B -reactivation; estimated incidence is approximately 0.3%. Hepatotoxicity, including fatal outcomes, is a risk associated with Tecvayli , and appears to be secondary to immunologic reactions such as CRS, infections and/or reactivation of latent infections such as (hepatitis) virus reactivation. Few patients treated with the proposed registrational RP2D dosage of Tecvayli had the dose reduced or discontinued due to TEAE. However, a substantial proportion of patients, up to 70% of patients 18 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 treated at RP2D , experienced cycle delay, delay within cycle or dose skipped due to TEAE, most frequently due to infections [up to 35%] (especially due to pneumonia), cytopenias [up to 30%] (especially due to neutropenia) and CRS (up to 12%). In addition, it is of note that , in the \"Non -RP2D\" SC cohort, which included patients who were dosed at dosages lower than the proposed registrational RP2D dosage, the proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to dose modification was more than 10% lower than at RP2D. This supports the assumption that lower dosages of Tecvayli could be associated with less toxicity. The proportion of patients who experienced CRS was high, 71% of all patients treated with the RP2D of Tecvayli , particular ly as all patients had received premedication including steroids. The most common AEs associated with CRS were pyrexia in almost all patients diagnosed with CRS , followed by chills, hypotension, and hypoxia, each in approximately 10%. However, given that almost all CRS events were of grade 1 and 2 severity, they were manageable without leading to treat ment discontinuation, the CRS frequency and severity decreased over time , and considering the poor prognosis of the targeted disease, the CRS- related safety profile is still considered acceptable. Neurologic AEs were reported in the majority (50- 60%) of patients treated with Tecvayli . (25%), encephalopathy motor (5- 10%), and delirium (2- 4%). Most neurologic AEs had a maximum severity of Grade 1 or 2; approximately 5% were Grade 3/4 and approximately 5% were serious. It is of note that one case of parkinsonism was reported after administration of Tecvayli , consisting of cogwheel rigidity, hypokinesia, lethargy, and tremor. While no Grade 5 neurologic AEs had been reported as of DCO 16 March 2022, subsequently a fatal case of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) was reported in a 67- year old female patient on the RP2D of Tecvayli . No other cases of GBS had been identified in any ongoing Tecvayli study as of 07 July 2022. See \" Warnings and precautions \" section of the information for healthcare professionals . As of DCO 16 March 2022, 9 of 203 patients (4.4%) treated at RP2D experienced Grade 1 (6 subjects [3.0%]), Grade 2 (2 subjects [1.0%]) or Grade 3 (1 subject [0.5%]) immune effector cell- associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Eleven of the 13 ICANS events (85%) were concurrent with CRS. The most common preferred term associated with ICANS was confusional state (2.0%) followed by aphasia (1.0%) and dysgraphia (1.0%). Based on available data, Tecvayli demonstrated low risk of immunogenicity. Of the 146 subjects evaluable for the presence of ADAs following the administration of the SC RP2D regimen, none were identified as positive for antibodies to Tecv ayli. Because, as per the protocol of pivotal Study MajesTEC -1, hospitali sation for at least 48 hours was required for all Phase 2 patients after step -up and first treatment dosing , as well as for the subsequent dose of Tecvayli in case of neurotoxicity (G rade 2) and CRS (Grade 2/3), pertinent monitoring recommendations have been mandated in the information for healthcare professionals . 6.5 Final clinical and clinical pharmacology benefit risk assessment Tecvayli has been proposed for the treatment of adult patients with triple- class exposed RRMM who had received at least 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. Historically this patient population has a poor prognosis as reflected by an ORR of approximately 30%, median PFS of approximately 3 to 6 months, and median OS of approximately 6 to 12 months. In addition, alternative therapeutic options are essentially limited to anti -BCMA CAR -T cell therapy, which may however not be suitable/available for all patients . Furthermore, no therapeutic options exist for triple-cl ass exposed RRMM patients, who additionally have received prior anti -BCMA therapy. Taken together, there is substantial medical need for new treatments for the proposed patient population. In heavily pretreated patients with triple -class exposed RRMM (median of 5 lines of prior therapy) without prior anti -BCMA therapy (CAR T -cell or antibody -drug conjugate) Tecvayli achieved an 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 of approximately 60%. Compared with historical results for patients with triple- exposed RRMM, including recently approved non- CAR- T therapies, ORR is approximately doubled. Even in patients with RRMM who had additionally received prior anti -BCMA therapy including CAR T -cells (median of 6 lines of prior therapy), a population for whom no alternative therapies exist, Tecvayli still achieved an ORR of 40%. Compared with historical data and recently approved drugs for the therapy of late relapses of MM, the updated (DCO 16 March 2022) estimated median PFS and OS of 10 months and 16 months, respectively, observed in the primary pooled Phase 2 population are encouraging and support the promising ORR results. However, data from only one pivotal Phase 1/2 clinical study have been provided, without the submission of any further supportive clinical data. Furthermore, the pivotal study was conducted open- label , so that relevant biases cannot be excluded. In addition, the interpretation of study results is challenging without a control arm, while cross -study comparisons are prone to bias. Furthermore, the primary endpoint of ORR used in the pivotal study MajesTEC -1 is not considered an established surrogate parameter for OS. Therefore, O RR results need to be accompanied by convincing evidence demonstrating favou rable treatment effects on OS, even more so as the targeted late stage RRMM indication is associated with a poor prognosis and high mortality burden. In spite of this, durations of exposure to Tecvayli and follow -up were short , and time -to-event efficacy endpoints including OS are immature. The most relevant risks associated with Tecvayli therapy are CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, and infections (including fatal infections such as COVID -19). All these AEs have been observed in substantial proportions of patients treated with Tecvayli. Overall, interpretation of safety is hampered by the lack of any comparator data in the safety pool, especially as the underlying disease might confound AEs such as cytopenias, infections (including COVID -19) and kidney injury. The limited duration of exposure to Tecvayli, differences in duration of exposure and follow -up across different patient cohorts and study phases, and differences in the safety r eporting between Phase 1 and Phase 2 patients in Study MajesTEC -1 further reduce the interpretability of the safety results. In addition, the safety database for this new molecular entity is small, based on a single Phase 1/2 study, and only 203 of 340 patients exposed to Tecvayli were treated with the proposed registrational dosage (RP2D) using the recommended SC route of administration, while many of the remaining patients achieved lower exposures. Taken together, the current basis of evidence is insuffic ient for a regular marketing authorisation. Instead, a temporary marketing authoris ation ex officio supported by the following post -marketing requirements (PMRs) has been considered adequate in light of the medical need, promising efficacy results and the overall manageable safety profile of Tecvayli. Post-marketing requirements ( PMRs ) requesting the submission of additional evidence to allow for a conclusive assessment of the benefit -risk ratio of Tecvayli when used per the above indication, have been mandated as a prerequisite for converting the temporary into a regular marketing authoris ation. These include the submission of Clinical Study Reports containing updated and current efficacy and safety results from the ongoing studies MajesTEC -1, MajesTEC -3, and MajesTEC -9. The last two are randomi sed controlled Phase 3 studies enrolling patients with RRMM, for which results were not available at the time of the initial marketing authorisation application. Availability of data from MajesTEC -3 and MajesTEC -9 is considered important, as this will allow the comparison of the efficacy and, in particular , safety of Tecvayli -based therapy versus the respective comparator therapies. Additional PMRs refer to the submission of current summaries of efficacy for other ongoing relevant clinical studies of Tecvayli for the treatment of MM, and the request to submit a curr ent safety analysis of all available data from the Tecvayli development program me. 20 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 7 Risk management plan summary The RMP summaries contain information on the medicinal products safety profiles and explain the measures that are taken to further investigat e and monitor the risks , as well as to prevent or minimise them.

TECVAYLI has been authorised temporarily, see acetic acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium acetate trihydrate, Sucrose (240 mg in 3 mL vial; 140 mg in 1.7 mL vial), Water for injection Total sodium content: 0.75 mg of sodium in 3 mL vial; 0.43 mg of sodium in 1.7 mL via l Pharmaceutical form and active substance quantity per unit TECVAYLI is a colorless to light yellow solution for injection. TECVAYLI is available in the following presentations: Each 3 mL vial contains 30 mg of teclistamab (10 mg of teclistamab per m L) Each 1.7 mL vial contains 153 mg of teclistamab (90 mg of teclistamab per mL) Indications/Uses TECVAYLI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody, and have demonstrated disease progression to the last line of therapy (see Properties/Effects ). Dosage/Administration TECVAYLI shoul d only be administered under the guidance of medical personnel experienced in the treatment of malignant haematological diseases, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities including immune effector cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome ( ICANS). Monitoring Intensive monitoring of patients is recommended in the following cases: Information for h ealthcare professionals 2 / 25 After each dose of TECVAYLI in the step- up dosing schedule ( step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2 and first treatment dose; see table 1, step-up dosing schedule). For subsequent TECVAYLI injections, if the patient experiences CRS (grade 2) or clinically relevant neurological toxicities following the previous dose of TECVAYLI. In these cases, inpatient monitoring should be provided for at least 48 hours in appropri ately equipped centres that have multidisciplinary teams with sufficient experience to provide intensive medical treatment for even the most severe complications . In addition, patients should be monitored daily for signs and symptoms of cytokine release sy ndrome (CRS), and neurological and other toxicities up to 7 days after TECVAYLI administration (see Dosage and Administration - Management of severe adverse reactions and Warnings and Precautions ). In addition, patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a treatment centre during this period. Any further monitoring is at the discretion of the physician. TECVAYLI should be administered by subcutaneous injection only. To ensure traceability of biotechnological medicinal products, it is recommended that the trade name and batch number should be documented for each treatment. Administer pretreatment medications prior to each dose of the TECVAYLI step -up dosing schedule (see Dosage and Administration - Pretreatment medications ). Recommended dosing schedule Administer TECVAYLI according to the step- up dosing schedule in Table 1 to reduce the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The recommended dosage of TECVAYLI is step- up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg followed by 1. 5 mg/kg once weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Failure to follow the recommended doses or dosing schedule for initiation of therapy or re -initiation of therapy after dose delays may result in increased frequency and severity of adv erse events related to mechanism of action of TECVAYLI , particularly cytokine release syndrome (see Dosage and Administration - Dosage modifications and Warnings and Precautions - Cytokine Release Syndrome ).

Information for h ealthcare professionals 3 / 25 Based on the available limited evidence, reduced dosing frequency (treatment every 2 weeks instead of weekly) after confirmed treatment response and at least four cycles of therapy was not associated with inferior efficacy. A lower dose (e.g. 0.72 mg/kg instead of 1.5 mg/kg) was tested during the dose- finding studies and was not associated with a lower response rate . Pretreatment medications Administer the following pretreatment medications 1 to 3 hours before each dose of the TECVAYLI step- up dosing schedule to reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (see Warnings and Precautions - Cytokine Release Syndrome and Undesirable effects ). Corticosteroid (oral or dexam ethasone, 16 mg) or intravenous mg or equivalent) Antipyretics (oral or intravenous acetaminophen, 650 mg to 1 '000 mg or equivalent) Administration of pretreatment medications may be required prior to administration of subsequent doses of TECVAYLI in the following patients: Patients who repeat doses within the TECVAYLI step- up dosing schedule following a dose delay (see Dosage and Administration - Restarting TECVAYLI after dose delays ) Patients who experienced CRS following the prior dose of TECVAYLI (see Dosage and Administration - Management of severe adverse reactions ) Prophylaxis for herpes zoster virus reactivation Prior to starting treatment with TECVAYLI, anti -viral prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of herpes zoster virus reactivation per local institutional guidelines. Restarting TECVAYLI after dose delays If a dose of TECVAYLI is delayed, restart therapy based on the recommendations listed in Table 2 and resume the treatment schedule accordingly (see Dosage and Administration - Recommended dosing schedule) . Administer pretreatment medications as indicated in Table 2 and monitor patients intensively according to section \"Monitoring\" following administration of TECVAYLI (see Dosage and Administration - Pretreatment medications and Monitoring).

Special dosage instructions Patients with hepatic disorders No formal studies of TECVAYLI in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (see Pharmacokinetic Properties ). Information for h ealthcare professionals 9 / 25 Patients with renal disorders No formal studies of TECVAYLI in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see Pharmacokinetic Properties ). Elderly patients (65 years of age and older) Of the 203 patients treated wi th TECVAYLI in MajesTEC -1 at the recommended dose, 47 % were 65 years of age or older, and 13 % were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. However, the number of patients aged 75 years or older was insufficient to determine differences in safety or effic acy. No dose adjustment is necessary (see Pharmacokinetic Properties ). Pediatric population TECVAYLI is not authorised for use in the paediatric population. Contraindications None. Warnings and precautions Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) TECVAYLI can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including life -threatening or fatal reactions (see Undesirable Effects). In the clinical trial, CRS occurred in 71 % of patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose, with Grade 1 CRS occurring in 51 % of patients, Grade 2 in 20 %, and Grade 3 in 0.5 %. Recurrent CRS occurred in 33 % of patients. Most patients experienced CRS following step- up dose 1 (42 %), step -up dose 2 (36 %), or the initial treatment dose (25 %). Two percent of patients developed f irst occurrence of CRS following subsequent doses of TECVAYLI. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 (Range: 1 to 6) days after the most recent dose with a median duration of 2 (Range: 1 to 9) days. Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS may include, but are not limited to, fever, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, headache, and elevated liver enzymes. Potentially life- threatening complications of CRS may include cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurologic toxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Initiate therapy according to TECVAYLI step- up dosing schedule to reduce risk of CRS (see Table 1). Failure to follow the recommended doses or dosing schedule for initiation of therapy or re -initiation of therapy after dose delays may result in increased frequency and severity of adverse events related to mechanism of action. Administer pretreatment medications (corticosteroids, antihistamine, and antipyretics) prior to each dose of the T ECVAYLI step -up dosing schedule to reduce risk of CRS and Information for h ealthcare professionals 10 / 25 monitor patients following administration accordingly ( see Dosage and Administration - Pretreatment medications and Dosage and Administration - Monitoring). In patients who experienced CRS following their previous dose, administer pretreatment medications prior to the next dose of TECVAYLI and perform intensive monitoring. Counsel patients to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur. At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate patient for hospitalization and institute treatment with supportive care based on severity. Withhold treatment with TECVAYLI until CRS resolves as indicated in T able 3 (see Dosage and Administration - Management of severe adverse reactions ). Neurologic toxicities including ICANS TECVAYLI can cause serious or life- threatening neurologic toxicity, including Immune Effector Cell - Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) (see Undesirable Effects ). In the clinical trial at the recommended dose, neurologic toxicity (including ICANS) occurred in 56 % of patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose, with Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity occurring in 4 % of patients. With longer follow -up, Grade 4 seizure and fatal Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (one patient each) occurred in patients who received TECVAYLI. For described cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), see Infections . In the clinical trial, ICANS was reported in 4.4 % of patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose. Recurrent ICANS occurred in 1 % of patients. Most patients experienced ICANS following step -up dose 1 (1.0 %), step -up dose 2 (1.0 %), or the initial treatment dose (1.5 %). Less than 2 % of patients developed first occurrence of ICANS following subsequent doses of TECVAYLI. The median time to onset of ICANS was 3 (range: 2 to 5) days after the most recent dose with a median duration of 2 (range: 1 to 20) days. The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities during treatment and treat promptly. Counsel patients to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurolog ic toxicity occur. At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, immediately evaluate patient and institute treatment based on severity as indicated in Table 5 (see Dosage and Administration - Management of severe adverse reactions ). For ICANS or other neurologic toxicities, withhold treatment with TECVAYLI as indicated in Table 4 and 5 and manage adverse reactions based on recommendations in Table 4 and 5. Infections Severe, life -threatening or fatal infections , including opportunistic infections, have been reported in patients receiving TECVAYLI (see Undesirable Effects ). In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, opportunistic infections occurred in 9.4 % of patients, with Grade 3 or higher infect ions in 6.4 %. Information for h ealthcare professionals 11 / 25 Fatal cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were observed across the TECVAYLI development program. New or reactivated viral infections occurred during therapy with TECVAYLI (see Undesirable Effects). In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, COVID -19 occurred in 17 % of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 COVID -19 infections in 5.4 %, and fatal infections in 6.9 %. Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells, and in some cases, may result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Patients with evidence of positive HBV serology should be monitored for cli nical and laboratory signs of HBV reactivation while receiving TECVAYLI, and for at least six months following the end of treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with TECVAYLI and treat appropriately. P rophylactic antimicrobials should be administered according to local institutional guidelines. Withhold treatment with TECVAYLI as indicated in Table 6 (see Dosage and Administration - Dosage modifications ). Hepatotoxicity TECVAYLI can c ause hepatoxicity, including fatalities. In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, there was one fatal case of hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indic ated. Withhold TECVAYLI or consider permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI based on severity and manage per local institutional guidelines (see Dosage and Administration - Dosage modifications). Hypogammaglobulinemia Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported in patients receiving TECVAYLI (see Undesirable Effects ). Monitor immunoglobulin levels during treatment with TECVAYLI and treat according to local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions, antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis, and admini stration of immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Vaccines Immune response to vaccines may be reduced when taking TECVAYLI. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following TECVAYLI treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment, during treatment, and at least 4 weeks after treatment. Neutropenia Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia have been reported in patients who received TECVAYLI (see Undesir able Effects ). Information for h ealthcare professionals 12 / 25 Monitor complete blood cell counts at baseline and periodically during treatment and provide supportive care per local institutional guidelines. Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection. Withhold treatment with TECVAYLI based on severity as indicated in Table 6 (see Dosage and Administration - Dosage modifications ). Hypersensitivity and other administration reactions TECVAYLI can cause both systemic administration- related reactions and local injection- site reactions. Systemic Reactions In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, 1.0 % of patients experienced systemic -administration reactions, which included Grade 1 recurrent pyrexia and Grade 1 swollen tong ue. Local Reactions In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, injection- site reactions occurred in 39 % of patients, with Grade 1 injection- site reactions in 35 % and Grade 2 in 4.4 %. Withhold TECVAYLI or consider permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI based on severity (see Dosage and Administration, Other Adverse Reactions) . Excipients TECVAYLI contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 vial, i.e. it is almost \"sodium -free\". Patient populations not studied in clinical trials The following patient groups were excluded from the MajesTEC -1 study: Patients with hypercalcemia > 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine < mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin < 80 g/L), ECOG per formance status > 1, CNS involvement, other plasma cell / monoclonal protein disorders, infections (HIV, AIDS, HBV, HCV) / autoimmune diseases (with the exception of vitiligo, Type 1 diabetes and prior autoimmune thyroiditis), cardiac disorders (congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV, myocardial infarction or CABC 6 months prior to enrollment, history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, history of severe non- ischemic cardiomyopathy), stroke or seizure within the last six months and patients who have received live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of TECVAYLI. Interactions No drug interaction studies have been performed with TECVAYLI. The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of TECVAYLI treatment could suppress CYP450 enzymes. CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be used with caution in Information for h ealthcare professionals 13 / 25 patients receiving TECVAYLI. Monitor for toxicity (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentrations (e.g., cyclosporine) for 48 hours after administration of all doses within the TECVAYLI step -up dosing schedule and for patients who develop cytokine release syndrome ( see Warnings and Precautions - Cytokine Release Syndrome). The dose of the concomitant drug should be adjusted as needed. Pregnancy, lactation Females and males of reproductive potential Pregnancy testing Pregnancy status for females of child- bearing potential should be verified prior to starting treatment with TECVAYLI. Contraception Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for five months after the final dose of TECVAYLI. Advise male patients with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for three months after the last dose of TECVAYLI. Pregnancy There are no available data on the use of TECVAYLI in pregnant women or animal data to assess the risk of TECVAYLI in pregnancy. Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is known to cross the placenta. Therefore, teclistamab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. TECVAYLI induces T -cell activation and c ytokine release, which may adversely affect the course of pregnancy. TECVAYLI should not be administered to pregnant women unless clearly indicated. TECVAYLI is associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, therefore, assessment of immunoglobulin levels in newbor ns of mothers treated with TECVAYLI should be considered. Lactation It is not known whether t eclistamab is excreted in human or animal milk, affects breastfed infants or affects milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in br eastfed infants from TECVAYLI, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with TECVAYLI and for at least five months after the last dose. Fertility There are no data on the effect of TECVAYLI on fertility. Effects of TECVAYLI on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. Effects on ability to drive and use machines Due to the potential for neurologic events, patients receiving TECVAYLI are at risk of depressed level of consciousness. Patients should avoid driving or oper ating heavy or potentially dangerous Information for h ealthcare professionals 14 / 25 machinery during and for 48 hours after completion of TECVAYLI step- up dosing schedule (see Dosage and Administration, Table 1) and in the event of new onset of any neurological symptoms until neurologic toxicity resolv es . Undesirable effects Adverse reactions are adverse events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of teclistamab based on the comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal relationship with teclist amab cannot be reliably established in individual cases. Further, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical t rials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Summary of the safety profile The safety data of TECVAYLI was evaluated in MajesTEC -1, which included 203 adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who received the recommended dose regimen of subcutaneous TECVAYLI as monotherapy. The median duration of TECVAYLI treatment was 7.8 (Range: 0.2 to 24.4) months . The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade ( 20 %) in patients were hypogammaglobulinemia (75 %), cytokine release syndrome (71 %), neutropenia (71 %), anaemia (54 %), musculoskeletal pain ( 52 %), thrombocytopenia (41 %), injection site reaction (40 %), fatigue (40 %), lymphopenia (36 %), upper respiratory tract infection (35 %), fatigue (35 %), diarrhoea (30 %), pyrexia (29 %), pneumonia (26 %), nausea (24 %), headache (24 %) constipation (23 %), cough (22 %), and pain (20 %). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 64 % patients who received TECVAYLI. Serious adverse reactions reported in 2 % of patients included COVID -19 (14 %), pneumonia (14 %), cytokine release syndrome (8 %), sepsis (6 %), musculoskeletal pain (6 %), pyrexia (4.9 %), acute kidney injury (4.4 %), febrile neutropenia (3.4 %), diarrhoea (3 %), cellulitis (2 %), hypoxia (2 %) and encephalopathy (2 %). Dose interruptions (dose delays and dose skips) of TECVAYLI due to adverse reactions occurred in 66 % of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions ( 5 %) leading to dose interruptions were neutropenia ( 27 %), COVID -19 (11 %), pneumonia (8 %), cytokine release syndrome (8 %) and pyrexia (8 %). Dose reduction of TECVAYLI due to adverse reaction occurred in one patient (0.5 %) due to neutropenia. Permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI due to adverse reactions occurred in two patient s (1 %), both due to infection. List of adverse reactions Table 7 summarizes adverse reactions reported in patients who received TECVAYLI. Information for h ealthcare professionals 15 / 25 Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common ( 1/10); common ( ( 1/10000 to < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10000); not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.ch. Overdose Signs and symptoms The maximum tolerated dose of teclistamab has not been determined. In clinical trials, doses of up to 6 mg/kg have been administered. Treatment In the event of an overdose, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately . Properties/Effects ATC code L01F Mechanism of action Teclistamab is a bispecific IgG4 antibody that targets the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is expressed mainly on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B -lineage cells, as well as late- stage B cells and plasma cells. Binding to T cells and BCMA results in T cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA + cells. Information for h ealthcare professionals 18 / 25 Pharmacodynamics Within the first month of treatment with teclistamab, activation and redistribution of T -cells, reduction of B-cells and induction of serum cytokines were observed. Within one month, the majority of responders had reduction in soluble BCMA. Immunogenicity Patients treated with subcutaneous teclistamab monotherapy were to teclistamab using an electrochemiluminescence- based immunoassay. One patient (0.5 %) developed antibodies to teclistamab of low -titer which were neutralizing. No patients treated with the recommended dose of TECVAYLI developed antibodies to teclistamab. Effect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology No clinical QT study has been conducted. At the recommended treatment dose (1.5 mg/kg) of TECVAYLI, no clinically relevant QTc prolongation has been reported. Clinical efficacy The efficacy of TECVAYLI monotherapy was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in a single- arm, open -label, multicenter, study (MajesTEC -1). The study included patients who had previously received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody . The study excluded patients with hypercalcemia 3.5 mmol/L), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine < 40 mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin < 80 g/L), ECOG performance status > 1, CNS involvement, other plasma cell / monoclonal protein disorders, infections (HIV, AIDS, HBV, HCV) / active or documented history of autoimmune diseases (with the exception of vitiligo, Type 1 diabetes and prior autoimmune thyroiditis), cardiac disorders (congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV, myocardial infarction or CABC 6 months prior to enrollment, history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, history of severe non -ischemic cardiomyopathy), stroke or seizure within the last six months and patients who have received live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of TECVAYLI. Patients received initial step- up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of TECVAYLI administered subcutaneously followed by the treatment dose of TECVAYLI 1.5 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once weekly thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see Dosage and Administration ). The efficacy population included 163 patients , consisting of 125 patients without prior anti -BCMA therapy and 38 patients with prior anti -BCMA therapy . The median age was 64 (Range: 32-83) years with 13 % of patients 75 years of age; 58 % were male; 82 % were White, 14 % were Black, 2 % were Asian. The International Staging System (ISS) at study entry was 50 % in Stage I, 34 % in Stage II, and Information for h ealthcare professionals 19 / 25 16 % in Stage III. High -risk cytogenetics (presence of del(17p) , t(4;14) or t(14; 16)) were present in 26 % of patients. 19 % of patients had extramedullary plasmacytomas. The median time s ince initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma to enrollment was 6.4 (Range: 0.9-24.1) years . The median number of prior lines of therapy was 5 (range: 2 -14) with 20 % of patients who received 3 prior lines of therapy and 79 % were triple- class refractory (refractory to PI, an IMiD agent and an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody). 83 % of patients received prior stem cell transplantation, 23 % received prior anti -BCMA therapy (27/38 patients received antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and 15/38 patients received chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR -T)). The median duration of exposure was 4. 6 (range: 0. 03 to 10.15) months , the median duration of follow -up was 6.4 (range: 0.03 to 10.71) months . Efficacy results were based on overall response rate (ORR, primary endpoint) as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria (see Table 8, cut -off date 07 September 2021).

At an updated clinical cut -off of 16 March 2022 at a median follow -up of 12.7 months , the median time to first response (TTR) was 1.2 months (range: 0.2 to 5.5 months ), the median duration of response (DOR) was 14.9 months (95 % CI: 14.9 to NE (not estimable)) and the median progression free survival (PFS) w as 8.8 months (95 % CI: 5.8 to 11.5) in the overall efficacy population (N=163) . Estimated median overall survival (OS) was not mature at 16.0 months (95 % CI: 12.2 to NE). At the updated clinical cut -off, in patients without prior exposure to an anti -BCMA therapy (N=125) at a median follow -up of 12.9 months the m edian TTR was 1.2 months (range: 0.2 to 5.5 months ), the median DOR was 14.9 months (95 % CI: 14.9 to NE) and the median PFS was 9.8 months (95 % CI: 6.8 to 16 .0). Estimated median OS was not mature at 16.0 months (95 % CI: 12.1 to NE). At the updated clinical cut -off, in patients with prior anti -BCMA therapy (N=38) at a median follow -up of 12.5 months the m edian TTR was 1.2 months (range: 0.2 to 4.9 months ), the median DOR was not Information for h ealthcare professionals 20 / 25 estimable and the median PFS was 4.5 months (95 % CI: 1.3 to NE). Estimated m edian OS was not mature at 14.4 months (95 % CI: 8.3 to NE). Temporary authorisation Due to incomplete clinical data at the time of the evaluation of the marketing authorisation application, TECVAYLI is granted a temporary marketing authorisation (Art. 9a Therapeutic Products Act). The temporary marketing authorisation is compulsorily linked to the timely fulfilment of conditions. Once these conditions have been fulfilled, the temporary marketing authorisation can be converted into a full marketing authorisation. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Teclistamab exhibited approximately dose- proportional pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration across a dose range of 0.08 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg (0.05 to 2.0 times the recommended dose). The mean accumulation ratio following 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous weekly dosing of teclistamab at steady state (based on the 7th weekly treatment dose) was 2.71 - and 3.05- fold for Cmax and AUC tau, respectively. The mean bioavailability following teclistamab subcutaneous administration was 69 % relative to intravenous dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters of teclistamab following the 1st and 7th recommended treatment dose of 1.5 mg/kg a re shown in Table 9. Table 9: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Teclistamab Following the First and Seventh Recommended Treatment Dose (1.5 mg/kg) in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma [MajesTEC -1] Pharmacokinetic Parameters The 1st Treatment Dose of 1.5 mg/kg The 7th Treatment Dose of 1.5 mg/kg (steady state) Tmax (hours) 72.0 (45.8 max; C max = Maximum observed serum teclistamab concentration; C trough = Observed serum teclistamab concentration prior to next dose; AUC tau = Area under the concentration- time curve over the weekly dosing interval. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, except for T max which is presented as median (minimum, maximum). Distribution Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, mean volume of distribution was 4.09 L (31.0 % coefficient of variation (CV)) for the central compartment and 1. 29 litre for the peripheral compartment Metabolism No data. Information for h ealthcare professionals 21 / 25 Elimination Teclistamab exhibited both time- independent and time- dependent clear ance. Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, the mean time- independent clearance was 0.545 L/day (49.4 % CV), with the median of time- dependent clearance contributing approximately 31 % of the total clearance at baseline and decreasing rapidly ther eafter to less than 5 % after week 8. Based on non -compartmental analysis, the mean half -life (standard deviation) was 3.8 (1.7) days (individual values ranging up to 8.8 days) following the first treatment intravenous dose. Population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on MajesTEC -1) showed that soluble BCMA did not impact teclistamab serum concentrations Kinetics in specific patient groups Hepatic impairment No formal studies of TECVAYLI in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild hepatic impairment did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment were not studied. Renal impairment No formal studies of TECVAYLI in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild or moderate renal impairment did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. Limited data are avai lable from patients with severe renal impairment . Age and sex The pharmacokinetics of TECVAYLI in pediatric patients have not been investigated. Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age (24 to 84 years ) and sex did not influence the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab. Preclinical data No effects on clinical or immunological parameters and safety pharmacology were seen in the 5- week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys with weekly intravenous administration of doses up to 30 mg/kg/week (equivalent to 22 times the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC exposure). Due to the lower binding affinity to monkey BCMA compared to human BCMA, and lack of pharmacodynamic activity at clinically relevant doses, clinical safety margins cannot be established from the nonclinical studies and the study cannot adequately inform on safety in humans Carcinogenicity/Mutagenicity No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been performed. Information for h ealthcare professionals 22 / 25 Reproductive toxicity No reproductive, developmental toxicity and fertility animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential effects of teclistamab.
