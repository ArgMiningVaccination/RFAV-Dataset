For the Emergency Use Authorization information, please refer to [the announcement of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.](http://www.mohw.gov.tw/cp-16-62288-1.html) For the Government-funded Vaccination, please refer to [the official website of the Centers for Disease Control.](http://www.cdc.gov.tw/Category/List/P2pYv_BSNAzqDSK8Qhllew) Features - The antigen is recombinant spike protein (S-2P) which is licensed from US NIH. The recombinant S-2P protein can maintain the trimeric pre-fusion form to make the antigen more stable. - With adjuvant of aluminum hydroxide and CpG 1018 developed by Dynavax. Progress - On 14 February 2022, MVC COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by Paraguay's regulatory authority, Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (DINAVISA). - On 27 October 2021, MVC-COV1901 was selected for WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Trial Vaccines. - On 19 July 2021, MVC COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by Taiwan FDA. - In June 2021, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) conducted an interim analysis of the study. The data showed that MVC COVID-19 vaccine did not elicit serious adverse reactions and is safe and well tolerated. - The large-scale Phase II clinical trial for MVC COVID-19 vaccine initiated at the end of 2020, and completed the enrollment of 3,015 subjects within 3 months.
