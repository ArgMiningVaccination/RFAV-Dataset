Prior to FDA approval, manufacturers must prove that their products are high quality, safe, effective, and free of contamination and defects. In addition, manufacturers of non-application products, such as over-the-counter and homeopathic products, are responsible for adhering to quality standards. Pharmaceutical manufacturers, no matter where they are located, are responsible for complying with Current Good Manufacturing Practice and ensuring that only quality products reach U.S. patients. To help ensure that high-quality drugs are sold in the U.S., CDER maintains a comprehensive quality surveillance program. A critical function of this program is testing selected drugs in FDA laboratories. This includes testing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). FDA laboratories generally test drugs to standards set by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), a scientific organization that sets minimum standards for the quality of medicines including: - Identity - is it the right drug as indicated on the label? - Assay - how much drug is there and is it consistent with the labeled amount? - Impurities - are there process impurities or degradation impurities? - Dissolution - does the active ingredient dissolve out of the dosage unit so that the drug is available for the body to absorb? CDER's quality surveillance program includes multiple tools that complement sampling and testing, including inspections, evaluation of post-market quality reports, signal detection, and data analysis. We are committed to protecting patients and consumers from unsafe, ineffective or poor-quality drugs. Testing We use a risk-based approach to quality testing. This means that in cases where there is a known or likely safety, effectiveness, or quality issue with a product, FDA scientists perform specific tests for this vulnerability. As you can see in the results below, the majority of drugs FDA tests meet their specifications. Beginning in 2018, CDER began using data analytics, including post-market quality data, to identify products that have potential quality risks. This more targeted, risk-based approach for sampling and testing has been effective in helping us identify more products per year that fail quality tests than in the years prior to 2018. If drug products have unfavorable testing results, we work swiftly to protect the public from potential harm. We share information with health care professionals and consumers to help them make decisions. In addition, we alert the manufacturer of the need to take measures to correct the problem underlying the unfavorable test results. We continue to monitor the situation until the manufacturer demonstrates compliance with FDA rules and regulations. does not meet label claim but within efficacy Failed Impurities| |Hand ALCOHOL ANTISEPTIC 80% TOPICAL SOLUTION||LIQUID||Tenn South Distillery LLC dba Big Machine | Distillery |Hand testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||Donati Family Vineyard, inc||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand and testing||Assay, Impurities, Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests for Specified Micro-Organisms||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Passed Impurities; Passed Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests for does claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| and testing||Assay, Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests for Specified Micro-Organisms||Passed Assay, Failed Impurities; Passed Microbial Enumeration Sanitizer||LIQUID||Indigeny Reserve||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Tests for Specified Micro-Organisms||Passed Assay, Failed Impurities; Passed Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests Specified Micro-Organisms| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||CLASSIC VINEGAR testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label within efficacy does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||On Hand Lotions, LLC||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||The Hanson Group||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Impurities, Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests for Specified Micro-Organisms||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities, Passed Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests for Specified Micro-Organisms| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||R&D Coatings, LLC||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label within efficacy Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||Alpha Aromatics||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, does within efficacy and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label within efficacy testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label but within Failed Impurities| testing||Assay, does not meet label but within Failed Impurities| testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||American Chemical Solutions LLC||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||Long Road Distillers||Hand Sanitizer sampling and testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests for Specified Micro-Organisms||Failed Assay, Passed Impurities, Passed Microbial Enumeration Test and Tests testing||Assay, Impurities||Assay does not meet label claim but within efficacy range; Failed Impurities| |Hand Sanitizer||LIQUID||ST.
