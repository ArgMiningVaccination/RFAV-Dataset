It derives from ancient India and is commonly referred to as the \"mother of all healing systems.\" It's purpose being to re-align our physiologies with the rhythms of the universe. The literal meaning of the word, however is \"the science of life\" (ayur = life, veda = science or knowledge). Ayurvedic practices are meant to heal \u2014 and more importantly prevent disease, increase the overall health and vitality of the body, and increase longevity. This is accomplished by rebalancing pranic life forces acting within the body mainly through dosha specific diet, meditation, and daily activity harmonized with the cycles of nature. Also utilized are rejuvenative herbal remedies, mineral and gem elixirs, and bodywork such as Ayurvedic massage, detoxification methods, herbal steam treatments, calming practices, yoga, and marma point therapy (balances our \"vibrational\" circulatory channels, the nadis). Ayurveda's herbal-based medical tradition uses plants with special potencies for pacifying doshic imbalances and re-establishing natal prakriti \u2014 the state of peace. The exact origin of Ayurveda cannot be traced, but archeological evidence has indicated a complex working medical knowledge in ancient India such as dentistry, plastic surgery, and even brain surgery as far back as 9,000 years ago (7,000 BC). The original texts of Ayurveda are a part of the Vedas \u2014 the world's oldest texts of knowledge \u2014 specifically the Atharva Veda. Within the Vedas, it is described that the knowledge was first handed down by Sri Dhanvantari, who is usually pictured carrying the vessel of immortality. Thus the essential knowledge of Ayurveda is eternal, and the evidence of this can be seen in its continuing usefulness even as the world situation changes. Ayurveda has two main goals: The ultimate aim of Ayurveda is to always maintain good health and well-being. And health, according to Ayurveda, is not merely eliminating the physical symptoms of a disease, but also restoring the happiness of the person's mind and soul. Often people may not be suffering from physical problems but they may be very unhappy and disturbed mentally. According to Ayurveda, such a person would be in a state of ill health (dis-ease or dis-order). Problems like depression, anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia, originate mainly from our disconnection with our essential natures. Unfortunately, most of our actions and activities today are related to materialism and our physical body. We rarely pay attention to our other half, which is equally important-the soul. Ayurveda gives the example of a parrot in a cage. If the cage is taken care of very nicely, but the parrot is neglected then its life is ruined. Similarly if we take care of the body but neglect the soul, our life is ruined. The diets and lifestyles we follow for achieving peace and happiness may also not be healthy for our inner selves. Since we are no longer taught the importance of mental and spiritual health-we remain unhappy, depressed, anxious and insecure, despite our best efforts. This is clearly indicative of something being wrong in our approach towards self-actualization and our relationship with matter and spirit. Ayurveda helps us in our endeavor to find happiness in life by recommending lifestyle adjustments. It teaches us how to live in natural balance by following a path that flows with nature rather than against it. Ayurveda is the perfect solution for all our health issues. Not only does it help people understand themselves and their needs, but it also provides guidelines on diet, lifestyle, exercise regimens and much more. But above all, Ayurveda teaches us to live in harmony within our society, with nature and with the universe at large, without disturbing the delicate natural balance. Above and beyond this, Ayurveda points one towards an understanding of the soul \u2014 which is our true self and above any physical or mental influence. While Ayurveda can bring one to physical and mental well-being, knowledge of the soul will bring one to ever-increasing happiness regardless of material condition. Dr. Vinick is the best! I'm so glad I found him. I've had terrible neck pain for years and I'm finally experiencing relief. He is so knowledgeable! Thank you Dr. Vinick for helping me finally live without such pain.

Vimala Velayutham I've been seeing Dr. Mark for a short time and I'm happy to report a great change in my acute and overall health. He has helped with back pain and inflammation of joints through combination of chiropractic and ayurveda . Being well versed in both disciplines is not common. He's a gem ! Ronald Calley I got really impressed by Dr Mark, he has experienced and knowledge. After my first visit, I felt released .... as a \"miracle\" my lower back uncomfortable GONE! Erika M. I got slipped disc and sciatica at the same time and I was introduced to Dr. Mark. He is an amazing chiropractor I've ever seen. I had 3 months of gun treatments and now I'm healed and able to work out everyday without the pain. I would definitely recommend to see him if you are looking for a chiropractor. Yuki K. I started going to Dr Mark at the recommendation of a good friend for assistance with an injury. After that healed, I've continued seeing him regularly for more than 10 years because I find his chiropractic and ayurvedic care to be quite worthwhile. I always feel refreshed and recentered after a visit, not just realigned. Torrance, CA "}
