It can also elicit nervousness in new patients that might be apprehensive about the insertion of needles. Most of our assumptions about needles are cultivated by the memory of vaccines or emergency injections. This is really a different experience from what is offered in my practice. This style of acupuncture, developed in Japan, emphasizes the use of painless, thin gauge needles. Perhaps because patients in New York already tend to be over-stimulated, I've found this gentle Japanese approach to be very effective. The first thing I do when a patient walks into my practice is to put myself in their shoes. From my perspective, a practitioner can't really begin to help a patient unless he can relate to them. Making the first job of any healer giving you their full attention. This is why I choose to see only see one patient at a time. It's also why I spend so much time scanning the body. There are 365 main acupuncture points in the body, and I scan each point every patient visit. This way my treatments can be specific and successful. For me, it's a meditation on your body. For the patient, the experience is very relaxing. I've had particularly great success treating fertility issues. In addition, skin imbalances, back pain, anxiety, and depression are also conditions that I've had great success in treating. acupuncture for fertility Some patients come to me for fertility treatments having never had any treatments for fertility, while some have seemingly tried everything. Some use acupuncture as a stand-alone treatment, while others use treatment in conjunction with biomedical approaches. No matter the patient's history or age, every case is unique and every patient deserves complete attention and care. Before a treatment even begins, I do an extensive inquiry and a full assessment of all the acupuncture points. I'm known for both my easy going presence and compassionate approach, which has helped me to develop trusted relationships with my fertility patients. This is important because of the emotional challenges that can often accompany fertility work. My reputation treating infertility in New York is so strong that I am regularly referred out by the in house midwives at St. Luke's Roosevelt hospital.
