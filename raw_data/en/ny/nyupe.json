The crystal bowl singing relaxes me and I feel balanced at the end of the chakra balancing session. I would highly recommend Denise.\" Eric F. Cumming, GA Chakra means \"wheel\" and is an energy system in the subtle body, with each of the 7 main Chakras resonating to different colors, sounds, crystals, gemstones, symbols, emotions, and organs in the body. Stress, environment, other people's energy, and emotions can block our chakras and put us out of balance. By developing a spiritual practice of 30 minutes a day of meditation, chanting, yoga, or Tai Chi, you can keep your chakras aligned. Chakra Balancing is my forte. I can't believe it's been over 20 years since I've become a Holistic Healer. It all started with my Reiki training. One day I was at the magnificent \"Tucson Gem Show.\" I started to see different gemstones and crystals that were in different shapes and colors for each of the chakras. So I started adding them to my Healing sessions. Then I studied essential oils and added both lavender and frankincense. I took a tuning fork workshop and bought a chakra set, that balances each chakra to its own unique frequency. Upon hearing the crystal singing bowls, I could feel them in my body, so I added a chakra set of bowls as well. Over the years, as I placed my hands on the chakras, I could intuitively here block emotions and issues that were stuck there. I have combined all of these modalities, to give you a one of a kind Healing session. The session ends with an intuitive consultation to help to guide you on your life's journey. \"It was a very great experience!! I loved it!! I felt like a new person.

I purchased the chakra balance healing session via her website, Denise contacted me by email within a day to schedule my session. We then communicated through texts as I confirmed the date and time that best fit our schedules. On the day of my healing session she texted me with instructions on where to park and how to gain access to the building. My actual healing session was amazing. Her space has great energy and was very comfortable. She balanced my chakra using crystals and sound bowls. Most importantly her energy throughout the session was warm and welcoming. Finally she completed the session with recommendations that touched me to the point of tears. I definitely recommend Denise as a spiritual healer and guide, "}
