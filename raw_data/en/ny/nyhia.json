In Greek antiquity he was a legendary highwayman who lived in Attica. He had an iron bed which he regarded as the standard of length. Because it just fit him, he concluded that every one should fit it. He stopped every traveller and tied him to the bed. If the person happened to be too short, Procrustes stretched him until he attained the correct length; if he happened to be too long, his legs were cut off until he met the proper requirement. Thus was everyone made identical in size.Drug Dosage Depends on: Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Therapeutic Window IdiosyncrasyKinetic Models: The LADME System L liberation (dissolution) A absorptionD distribution (disposition) M metabolism E excretion- AUCt - AUC0 -Cmax -tmax -A e -A e -d A e d t-C l -M R T-t \u00bdPharmacokinetic ParametersPharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics Usually Model Independent Calculations Parametric approach: - 90% CI (equivalent to the rejection of 2 one sided Hoat 5% level) - Log transformation of concentration & concentration dependent variablesCalculation of BioequivalenceDeviation Allowed for bioequivalence is usually +/- 20% Sufficient washout period between treatmentsSequence EffectsSampling covers at least 80% of the AUCSteady-state sampling over full 24 hoursCalculation of BioequivalenceCalculation of BioequivalenceCalculation of BioequivalenceCalculation of BioequivalenceRenal Elimination Filtration Passive Processes Active Processes Usually correlates with measures of renal functionHepatic Elimination Hepatic Elimination Partially documented for the Cytochromes P450 Group of related isoenzymes Hydroxylation of hundreds of structurally diverse drugs. The reaction involves NADPH co-factor: NADPH + H(+) + O(2) ROH addition, cytochrome P450 catalyses N-, O- and S- dealkylation via an initial hydroxylation stage and may catalyse N-oxidation. Enzyme activity varies with age, sex, race and isoformCYP450 Hepatic Elimination Implications for altered Biotransformation : Therapeutic Failure: - Cyclosporin and graft rejection Increased Pharmacologic Effects: -CYP2D6 substrate in the first 1-2 weeks Increased Antibiotic (2nd generation cephalosporin) Commonly used in general practice for minor infections (including Viral) Major Pathway of Excretion: Renal (50-80%) Bowel (via the Bile)Cefaclor Toxicity (<12) Serum Sickness (Like ) Reaction 5-10 starting the course Rash (Urticarial / Erythema +/- testing (genotype / phenotype) - Drug and dose: Classical & Population PK methods Genotyping & Phenotyping Prediction of adverse events: - Who will have reactions before they have them Decreased risk of toxicity: - Define therapeutic ranges for individualsPharmacodynamics - How & Where Drugs Act?
