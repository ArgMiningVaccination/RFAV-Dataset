This morn-ing we begin a series of hearings that will explore three questions:One, what is the value of the prescription drug products we buy?Two, what.are the benefits of these.%drugs as compared to theircosts? And three, what can we do to make certain that we arepaying a fair price? From the tiniest baby in America-to the oldestcitizenin~our country, it is an issue that affects~all ofius.First,1-must say I'm sorely disappoiiiterl:iat-we W-1 be unableto adequately pose and ultimately answer these questions thismorning because those companies that manufacture these drugschose not to come to this hearing. They chose not to testify todayeven though we changed the timing of this hearing to accommo-date the conflict of schedules of company spokespersons. Theyshould, it -would appearwant to be present to make themselvesavailable to be a part of this dialogMany of these companies who proclaim the benefits their drugsproduce evidently refuse in public to talk about the profits thatthey-reap. When it comes to boasting of their profits to Wall-Street, the drug companies. can be heard loud and clear, but theyare awfully quiet when it comes to discussing the prices theycharge on Main Street. Only one of the 18 drug manufacturers that was invited ispresent today. Those invited today who are not here include: Amer-ican Home Products Corp., Barr Laboratories, ,Bolar Pharmaceuti-.cal, Eli Lilly and Co., Geneva Generics, -Inc.,G-`laxo, Inc., MarionLaboratories, Inc., Merck Sharp Companies, Inc., ,Schein Pharmaceutical, Schering-Plough (1)2 Corp., Smithkline Beckman Corp., Squibb Corp., Syntex Corp., The Upjohn Co., Vitarine Pharmaceuticals, and Warner Chilcott Lab- oratories. I also believe the public should hear some of the firms' reasons for not appearing today. One reason, in an answer to my request was, \"We believe that a hearing is not an appropriate forum in which to elucidate the very complex issues you raise.\" I wonder what the proper setting might be? The second response that we got, and another I think you might be interested in: \"The data you have requested on international prices are of limited analytical value.\" Now, I appreciate this re- sponse, trying to save our time, but I would also think the Commit- tee would like to draw its own conclusion as to the value of this data. Why do companies fear this particular public forum? These com- panies are strong, their profits are phenomenal. Let me read you what Wall Street is saying about these manufacturers. The Wall Street analysts at Hambrecht & Quist, Inc. said: \"The profitability for the pharmaceutical industry has been consistently above that of the Standard and Poors 400, the main industrial sector of the market. If anything, this gap has widened over the past 10 years.\" An analysis of industry profit data shows that the top manufac- turers earned steadily increasing profits from 1986 through 1988, while their taxes actually went down during the same 3 years. This data shows that 11 top U.S. drug makers had an average stock earnings record better than 78 percent of American manufacturers. Wall Street investment analysts, at Le Rothschild, Unterberg, and Towbin, said as recently as 1986: Since the late 1970s-but most noticeably in the last 3 years- pricing has become the major force in generating revenue growth for drug companies. Why are these companies relying on price increases when they could be generating new sales with breakthrough drug products that actually heal the sick? Here's what the London Economist said in 1987: Most recent drug product launches have been \"me-too\" drugs which do not find new markets but simply provide substitutes for older products. They are viewed with increasing impatience by regulatory authorities, who see \"me-toos\" as unneces- sarily fancy versions of adequate drugs. The Economist further summarizes the problem for the drug companies this way: \"'Me-too' drug products are evidence of the drug companies' poverty of inspiration. While 'me-toos' may keep the companies' new product rosters looking healthy, their value-to the consumer is open to question.\" Now, to be fair, since the drug companies have refused to show up this morning, I will make one of their arguments for them. Re- search and development for new drugs is very expensive. And I agree. I think all of us do. On the chart I farthest to my right you will see one of the industry's latest advertisements, claiming that it costs $125 million to bring what they call a new drug to the market. This is one of a series of advertisements the Pharmaceuti- cal Manufacturers Association is running. ' See appendix 1, p. 339 for charts used in hearing.3 Now, the point of this ad is to remind us that the high prices wepay for many prescription drugs are our investment in expensiveresearch and development, or R&D as our tax laws label it.I looked into the research this ad is based upon, though, andwhat the ad doesn't tell us about the new drugs they say cost $125million to develop is that they represent only about one-fourth ofnew drugs brought to market by the drug companies. The other 75percent of the so-called new drugs are actually streamlined ver-sions of old drugs; thus, the label of me-too drugs.The drug companies want us to believe that it takes $125 millionto invent the next penicillin, or a cure for AIDS, or treatment forAlzheimers. All of us would consider a cure for these diseases abargain at $125 million. I would like to take this opportunity topersonally recognize the hundreds of those scientists, researchers,and technicians who daily fight the battle-against such dreaded dis-eases. But let's be honest with each other. Most new drugs are notbreakthrough drugs. In fact, for every breakthrough product theyinvent, American drug companies bring 24 Xdrugs tothe marketthat provide little or no therapeutic gain over alreay-marketeddrugs, according to ratings by the Food and Drug. Administration.Some people call these \"me-too\" drugs because they represent acompany's attempt to jump into.-a profitable market for an existingdrug therapy. If we look at the next chart, closest to me, the onelabeled the \"The Me-Too Factor,\" you will see that of the 348 newdrugs brought to the market by the top 25 drug companies between1981 and 1988, 292 of these 348 were classified by the Food andDrug Administration in the so-called \"C\" category.2 These companies produced a total of only 12 \"important\" newdrugs, and 44 other products that make what FDA called a\"modest contribution\" to existing therapies. This translates to thefact that 84 percent of new drugs fall into FDA's \"C\" category,making \"little or no\" contribution to anything but the bottom lineof a profit and loss statement. The story is the same if you consider the value of the minority ofnew drugs, called \"new molecular entities,\" referred to by thePMA, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, in their ads.About 60 percent are rated by FDA as me-too drugs with question-able benefits no matter how you slice it.And folks, the situation gets worse because the prices establishedby drug companies for these modest and insignificant new drugsare anything but modest and insignificant in their pricing. Thenext chart, labeled \"Drug Price Increases Outpace Inflation, 1981to 1988,\" graphically illustrates how price increases by drug manu-facturers outpaced the general inflation rate. In fact, from 1981through 1988 the prescription drug inflation rate of 88 percentdwarfed the general inflation rate of 28 percent. The Wall Streetinvestment analysts I mentioned before, Hambrecht & Quist, Inc.,said last year: \"New drugs are priced higher, in most cases sub-stantially higher, than older medications.\" 2 See appendix 1, p. 339 for charts used in hearing.4 Manufacturers claim they need exorbitant prices in order to pay for their research and development expenses. Once again, let's be honest with one another. The American public is footing much of the bill for these companies' research and development costs. Fact: Through the use of the R&D tax credits, special expensing and allocation rules, and the possession tax credit for Puerto Rico, drug companies annually receive tax breaks well in excess of $1 billion. For example, in 1985, even before the 1986 tax bill, drug companies received R&D-related tax breaks of almost $1 billion, representing more than 24 percent of their tax expenditures. Fact: Between 1984 and 1987, the American pharmaceutical in- dustry's effective tax rate decreased by more than 27 percent. Fact: The 1986 tax law provided even more liberal incentives for the drug companies in research and development and other tax breaks and subsidies. Fact: Since 1981, R&D tax credits for just two drug companies in America added up to $93 million. So let's be honest with ourselves. When the pharmaceutical man- ufacturers talk about research and development, let's talk about who really is paying for the research and development costs, the American taxpayer and the American consumer. American physicians often do not realize that new drugs cost more than the drugs they are already buying. In fact, I am told that the costs of these new and largely duplicative drugs contribut- ed significantly to CBO's recent increase in cost estimates for the Medicare drug benefit program. We have a lot to learn about drug companies in this country. What do people pay for the same drugs, in other countries? How are Americans faring, for example, with our European friends? Let's take a look at the next bar graph, \"International Drug Price Comparison, Weighted Average Retail Price Per Brand Drug, 1987.\" It shows that Americans pay as much as five times more than European citizens pay for the same prescription drugs. Here in the United States the price you pay for a prescription drug depends on who you are and what kind of deal you can strike with the manufacturer. The final chart, entitled \"Range of Market Prices for Prescription Drugs,\" shows how hospitals and the Veter- ans Administration get the best prices. Who gets the worst prices? Medicaid, Medicare, and the general.public buying at the pharma- cies get the worst price, because the pharmacists have to pay the very highest price. I have graphically, I hope, something else to illustrate here. After all the charts and after all the graphs and all the words, it comes down to this. We have here the published list price for Motrin, for example. Here's that published list price. I'll put that right there. [Demonstrating bottle of Motrin.] The CHAIRMAN. Here's what Medicare would pay for that Motrin: $29. Here's what the hospital pays, $8 for the same bottle. Here's what the Department of Veterans Affairs pays, $5. So we see a vast range of price variation between the various prices that the drug manufacturers charge to these prospective customers. Let me also state that the local pharmacist at the local drug store, the person who is out there in the trenches every day, in the5 foxhole, selling drugs to Aunt Minnie and Cousin Joe and whoever,this druggist is the one who has to almost on a weekly or monthlybasis tell those consumers that their prices are going up yet onceagain. Now, why is it that we're seeing those tremendous price in-creases when the druggist himself, as we will see later in another*Chart, is receiving only a few pennies, only a few cents more, for aprescription which is backed up by Medicare and other governmen-tal programs? .We have a lot of questions to answer. We have several Senatorshere. I will use the early bird rule. I will call on Senator Wilson ofCalifornia first.

But, let's be honest here. These drugs are not \"breakthrough\" drugs. In fact, for every breakthrough product they invent, American drug companies bring 24 drugs to market that provide little or no therapeutic gain as rated by the Food and Drug Administration. Some people call these me-too, drugs because they represent a company's attempt to jump into a profitable market for an existing drug therapy.

Chart 3 [REFER TO APPENDIX D OF AGING COMMITTEE STAFF BRIEFING PAPER] graphically illustrates how drug price increases outpace the general inflation rate.

A few weeks ago, an 82-year-old constituent in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania wrote ma about the burden of paying for the 100 pills she must take every month. Even with a medigap policy, Mrs. C writes, she pays hundreds of dollars out-of -pocket annually for 'drugs, and the cost creeps up by 10 percent or more each time she gets a refill. Mrs. C is typical of millions of older Americans whose fixed, limited incomes increasingly are eroded by rising drug costs. Of the $9 million seniors spent for prescription drugs in 1986, $7.3 million -- or more than 4 out of every 5 dollars -- came from their own pockets. By including a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Catastrophic Act, Congress acknowledged the considerable burden of drug costs on the elderly, a burden that studies have shown actually prevents many seniors from getting the medications they need. As currently structured, more than 5 million elderly, each of whom presently spends over $600 a year on medication, would be helped by this benefit. I am concerned over new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that suggest the prescription drug benefit is too costly for the government to finance with current revenues. As the principle author of this legislation, I remain convinced that the benefit not only is necessary, but that it is financially feasible. I have asked CBO to revisit their calculations. In addition to the financial protections provided under the drug benefit, the Catastrophic law also establishes a unique, nationwide tracking and reviewing system that allows pharmacists to monitor the prescription drug regimens of Medicare beneficiaries. More than 250,000 elderly are hospitalized for adverse drug reactions or side effects from over-the-counter drugs each year. The Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program can save both lives and dollars by preventing such hospitalizations. Senator Wilson and I have introduced legislation, S. 859, to fine-tune what we believe are some of the shortcomings of the DUR program as written into Catastrophic, including safeguarding the confidentiality of data and making better use of existing technology from the Department of Defense. I hope we will be able to deal with these recommendations as part of the reconciliation process. (over)11 Mr. Chairman, on thezissue of fine-tuning, you have joinedSenator Wilson-and me in expressing some serious concerns aboutthe Health Care Financing Administration's Request for Proposal(RFP) for-the'DUR system. HCPA's vision of a DUR falls farshort of Congressional intent and underestimates thetechnological feasibility of a comprehensive system. TheGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) is about to release a report onthis subject. I would hope that Acting Administrator Hays willbe open to amendments to the RPP as called for by the GAOfindings. Congress has applied cost containment measures to hospitals andphysicians under Medicare. There is no question that drug costsdeserve similar evaluation and that Congress may need tolegislate to control the rate of increases. Today's hearing isan important step in evaluating the extent of the problem andthe relative weight of the causes. Again, I. commend you forbringing us together this morning and would urge you to schedulea second hearing on the DUR in the near future.12 SENATOR BILL BRADLEY TESTIMONY 4 PRESCRIPTION DRUG HEARING /i /JAx SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING JULY 18, 1989 Mr. Chariman, I thank you for holding this hearing today. Prescription drugs represent a major and growing cost for the Nation's elderly. And they provide significant benefits in terms of length and quality of life. Mr. Chariman, we have an enormous task before us -- how can you contain rising health care costs while at the same time improve the quality of health care provided to senior citizens? I believe the prescription drug benefit adoption last year as part of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was a good step in protecting the elderly from health care costs. But clearly more will need to be done in the years ahead. I have a couple of questions that I would like to submit for the record to Louis B. Hays, the Acting Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. As a general rule, what are the costs to the health care system and benefits to consumers to treat disease conditions with drugs rather than surgery or hospitalization? Can you identify drugs which have saved Medicare money because they have replaced surgery or hospitalization? Can these savings be quantified? Are there drugs that cost Medicare money and do not demonstrably improve the quality of life of Medicare beneficiaries? There are many ways to control costs for goods and services, whether it be through regulatory control, the free market or public ownership of a product. In the US, we have a system of patented brand name drugs and generic drugs. We often have a number of drugs in the same therapeutic category used to treat a particular condition. How effective is our current system of generic/brand name drugs in controlling costs? What is the impact on costs and on benefits to consumers when there are only several brand name drugs available to treat a specific disease?13 STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETE WILSONSenator WILSON. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I must say that was a remarkable opening statement. I think it reveals the need for the hearing. I commend you for conducting it.Mr. Chairman, I would like to say at the outset that I am happy to be able to welcome a constituent, Dr. George Rathmann, chair- man of the board of Amgen, Inc., a company from Thousand Oaks, CA. Amgen is a truly significant entrepreneurial biotechnologyfirm, one really entering the market, and one-that has gained great national attention in recent weeks with the Food and Drug Admin- istration's approval of Epogen, its first commercial product and one that provides treatment of the severe anemia often associated with chronic kidney failure. So if you're suffering from a lack of witnesses in other areas, you have one here that I think will be both relevant, and one whom I am pleased to introduce to the committee.I will be required to be absent through a part of the testimony in order to be on the floor for the State authorization bill. But let me just say that the steady and continued growth in prescription drug costs, as you have rather dramatically indicated in one of your charts, not only significantly outpaced the rate of the general infla- tion, but also significantly the cost of both hospital and physician services. Inflation in prescription drug prices is of great and mounting concern in both the public and the private sectors. For many businesses the cost of prescription drug coverage is the fast- est growing component of their health benefit packages with the exception of what they provide by way of mental health and sub- stance abuse coverage. The continued escalation of prescription drug prices has particu- lar relevance to the Federal Government, as you have indicated, as it prepares to implement a comprehensive outpatient prescription drug program for elderly Americans under the Medicare Cata- strophic Coverage Act. In anticipation of the Medicare prescriptiondrug benefit, Mr. Chairman, we are indeed well-advised to explore the factors behind prescription drug pricing increases and to exam- ine the means of obtaining prescription drugs at the best possible price. One cannot help but be struck by the data to be shown this morning, some of which you have shown in your opening state- ment, that demonstrate the wide range of market prices paid for brand name prescription drugs. As the data will show, the Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs; for example, obtains prescription drugs at a significantly lower cost than those expected to be paid by Med- icare once the drug benefit is implemented.And while differences exist in the Department of Veterans Af- fairs and the Medicare Program in terms of their respective pre- scription drug purchasing abilities, I believe we must thoroughlyexplore the extent to which Medicare can organize itself to obtain the best possible price for prescription drugs.At the heart of this hearing, Mr. Chairman, is the question of what can be done to restrain the costs of prescription drugs. Rising drug prices alone, however, do not tell the whole story behind over- all prescription drug expenditures. The misutilization and inappro-14 priate prescription of drugs play a role as well. Therefore we also must .vigorously explore other cost containment strategies to rein in prescription drug expenditures. In this regard it is essential that Congress take full advantage of technology to monitor the utilization and appropriateness of outpa- tient prescription drugs. Inappropriate and excessive prescriptions are particularly a problem for the elderly who, given the greater likelihood of being under the supervision of more than one physi- cian and of taking multiple medications, are at greater risk of ad- verse drug reactions and interactions. In a report issued by this committee last year, as many as 120 million drug prescriptions for older Americans may have been inappropriate, at a cost of over $2 billion for the drugs themselves. By preventing inappropriate and excessive drug prescriptions, a prospective drug utilization review system will result in a substantial financial savings, but more im- portant by far, in avoidance of inappropriate and perhaps harmful medication. While considerable savings will result due to the dis- continuation or modification of drug prescriptions, even greater savings will come through avoiding the unnecessary and costly drug therapy-related hospitalizations and remedial care that result from this inappropriate drug prescription. And most importantly, obviously, drug utilization review will save tens of thousands of older. Americans from the needless pain and suffering that comes from adverse drug reactions and interactions. Recognizing the potential of drug utilization review, Congress di- rected the Department of Health and Human Services to imple- ment a drug utilization review system as part of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Given my belief in the potential of drug -utilization review and concerns that the Health Care Financing Administration's drug utilization review implementation plans were- not consistent with Congressional intent, I authored legislation to clarify requirements of the drug utilization review program to ensure a comprehensive state-of-the-art system with adequate privacy and confidentiality safeguards. I am very pleased that you, Mr. Chairman, and the ranking member, Senator Heinz, have joined me in sponsoring this legisla- tion and I'm confident that prospective, comprehensive drug utili- zation review will play a major role in our efforts to restrain the costs of Medicare's prescription drug benefit. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to this Committee's ex- amination of prescription drug manufacturers' pricing practices. It is clear that as the Federal Government becomes a major purchas- er of prescription drugs through the Medicare Program, we must explore strategies for being a prudent and efficient buyer of such drugs. In addition, I am hopeful that in the course of considering the broad question of controlling costs of Medicare's prescription drug benefit, this Committee will have the opportunity in the future to fully explore drug utilization review systems' potential to save mil- lions of dollars in unnecessary Medicare costs and to save thou- sands of elderly Americans from needless pain and suffering. Thank you. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Wilson, thank you for your contribution.15 Let us see if we can sort of lay down a little rule-I should have mentioned this earlier-if we can basically limit our opening state-ments to around 3 minutes. I hate to call time on my colleagues.Senator Reid. STATEMENT OF SENATOR HARRY REID Senator REID. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for providing membersof this committee with an opportunity to examine the currentcrisis in prescription drug costs. I'd like to acknowledge and extendmy thanks to those witnesses that are going to appear.We've all heard horror stories from people in our home States-the cost of monthly prescription drugs, suddenly, for example, in- creasing by two-fold, sometimes more than that; monthly prescrip-tion bills surpassing monthly food bills, or worse, supplanting food bills. Our elderly, in particular, must frequently choose betweengoing hungry at the end of the month or refilling an essential but costly prescription. As we discussed the various options for resolving the MedicareCatastrophic Act controversy, we considered reducing benefit levels in order to accommodate lower taxes for seniors. One benefit whichwould be sure to go would, of course, be the very expensive pre- scription drug benefit. If we do away with the Catastrophic Act, as I hope we do, or if we remove some of the more costly benefits, in- cluding the drug benefit, the heed to stop rising drug costs will be all the more urgent. Affordable prescription drugs are vital to this Nation's health. Mr. Chairman, in your opening statement you talked a lot about the profits that these companies make. And certainly this is some-thing we must review closely, but we also must understand that these drug companies are getting little, if any, help from the Gov- ernment. Any expenditures they make in developing these new drugs are coming from their own corporate accounts.Mr. Chairman, several members of this committee-I know that there are some that have had family members that have been ill- have looked for these specialized drugs. Speaking for myself the last little bit, I have had some experience with this with two mem- bers of my family. Even though the drugs were very expensive, I was very happy that the manufacturing companies went the extra distance to come up with these specialized drugs.So it's a difficult balance that we have to make, that is, to make sure that these companies have the proper incentives to continuetrying to come up with some of these drugs, as you have illustrat-ed, these new drugs. I think it goes without saying, Mr. Chairman, that striking a bal- ance is difficult. There is an entirely new subject that we need to be concerned about, and that is what the Government should be doing to help these companies develop these new products. We know that approximately one-third to one-fourth of all prescriptiondrugs come from the rain forests, but yet the rain forests are being destroyed. So, this problem, even though it indicates that people are paying a lot for drugs-and I acknowledge that, and recognize that we have to do something to stop the spiraling costs-we also16 have to be concerned that there is an incentive for these drug com- panies to continue manufacturing and developing new products. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Reid. Senator Grassley. STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It appears that the recent reestimate of the cost of the Cata- strophic Health Care Act shows that the surplus which we recently thought would be available for reducing the cost of that program to the taxpayers has disappeared. It was this surplus which was ex- pected by some Senators to allow for the rollback in the rates so as to respond to the anger of those that will pay the supplemental premium. As I. understand it the surplus disappeared because rees- timates of the program costs showed that the prescription drug benefit was going to be much more expensive than we had antici- pated. I gather that the witness from the Health Care Financing Ad- ministration will say today that these Congressional Budget Office estimates, that have been back and forth on both ends of the court over the last month, are in keeping with what the Administration -has been projecting for program costs for some time. It seems pretty clear that if drug prices escalate at a rapid rate, costs for the prescription drug program-assuming that we let it go into effect and that it is legislated-will present the Congress and the Administration with some unpleasant choices. If the past- is any guide to the future in our public life, all that we have to do, Mr. Chairman, is look to what has been happening to hospitals and doctors and the Medicare program in recent years to get an.indication of what could be happening to drug manufac- turers and pharmacists soon enough. And that is simply that when the Federal Government gets into a program, we have a way of helping drive up prices. Unfortunately, it's probably going to be dif- ficult to achieve a consensus on thissubject, because it is very con- troversial. ,4.We..have in our public debate an the -subject 'sharply different viewsan the sources -of the .problem. On- the one hand, some think that drug manufacturers have aggressively exploited their price policies, which leads to very rapid inflation in drug prices. Price in- creases in prescription drug products have run as high as 10 per- cent per year until just the last -couple years and that's consider- ably in excess of -the Consumer Price Index. Now, manufacturer profits on prescription drug products run as high as 15 percent according to some information in recent reports from HCFA. On the other hand, itis clear that it is risky and ex- pensive to develop -new products. Relatively few of the great many * products in which- investments are made even make it into the market. The new drug approval process, which is long and complicated, and contributes to delays in getting a new product to market, and after new drugs make it to the market they have patent protection for a- relatively short period of time before.cheaper generic drugs make it to the market. With possible commencement of the new17 Medicare Prescription Drug Program, these issues all take on added importance. So, of course, it's very good that we hold this hearing. However, I don't know whether we can expect an answerto this problem as long as the Federal Government is a drivingforce in the cost of health care generally, and that's going to be as true as ever of this prescription drug program.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley, thank you very much.Senator Shelby. STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD SHELBYSenator SHELBY. Mr. Chairman, I'll try to be brief.First of all I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. I believe it's very important, and very important to the American people, and especially the elderly.The issue of prescription drug pricing is of interest to all of us, but it impacts significantly upon the elderly, as the chairman has pointed out. Many seniors are not limited to just one medicationeach day, but are often taking several drugs at one time. For exam-ple, approximately 6.7 million elderly are taking three or more pre- scription drugs each day, or at one time, and one-third of the pa- tients in nursing homes receive eight or more drugs daily, Mr. Chairman. Also, we know that the seniors over age 65, only 12 percent of the population in this country, consumed 32 percent of the 1.53 bil- lion prescriptionis written in 1984. And that was in 1984; since then this figure has risen significantly. I'm sure, Mr. Chairman, that this figure has increased. Given these statistics, it is not difficult to imagine the tremendous price tag associated with obtaining medi-cation in this country. However, I also truly believe that drugs are a very cost-effectivepart of health care. A properly prescribed drug regimen can pre- vent the onset of more serious illnesses and can often preempt hos- pitalization. But soon many elderly individuals will be priced out of the market. I've talked to many local pharmacists in my State of Alabama who carry from month to month some of the elderly cus- tomers who cannot afford some of their prescriptions, knowing the serious consequences which may arise without the prescribed medi- cation. With passage of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act last year, Medicare will cover a portion of the costs of prescriptiondrugs. Therefore it is important to understand the pricing policies and develop mechanisms for cost containment before the program is fully implemented. I'm particularly interested in pricing differ-ential practices, as you are, Mr. Chairman.I'm anxious to hear from our distinguished panel of witnessesthis morning, and I would particularly like to thank Mr. Rath- mann for appearing before this committee. As the chairman men- tioned, several other pharmaceutical manufacturers were invited but declined the offer. I think they should be here.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Shelby.Senator Cohen.18 STATEMENT, OF SENATOR WILLIAM COHEN Senator ComN_. Mri.Chairman, I have a -very brief statement * which I would like to insert in the record. * This hearing is important to the elderly, to the taxpayers, and certainly to the drug manufacturing industry -itself, and I will de- prive the waiting audience of- further remarks from me so that we can move on. [The prepared statement of Senator Cohen follows:]19 Senator William S. Cohen The Im ortance of Understanding Rising Prescription Drug Costs I would like to commend the Chairman for holding a hearing on this very relevant subject. Prescription drugs are becoming an increasingly important part of the medical care provided in-this country. As the costs of medical care of risen dramatically, the nation has searched for more efficient and effective ways to provide care. Increasingly, we are finding it possible and beneficial to use prescription drugs as an alternative to some medical procedures. Prescription drug treatment has not only become a more comfort- able form of treatment in some cases, but it is less costly. Patients benefitting from drug treatment may experience less pain and be able to return to normal daily routines quicker than they have in the past. While prescription drug treatment may be a less costly form of treatment for certain ailments, the costs have still been rising. This is of particular concern to our elderly population who often have to bear the burden of paying for drugs. And, as the elderly consume a large portion of the prescription drugs purchased, it is they who are most adversely affected by the rising prices.20 The high cost of prescription drugs is also becoming more of a concern to the government as we have-decided to embark on a major expansion of Medicare. It is crucial for us to under- stand the nature of prescription drug pricing before we begin providing the prescription drug benefit through Medicare begin- ning in 1991. We are well aware of the difficulties we are having controlling the costs of Medicare. It is essential that government not add to the problem of medical care inflation because of our presence in the prescription drug marketplace. That will only make our health care woes worse. Today, we will learn how to obtain a.favorableyprice for prescription drugs that benefitw consumers and is-fair to pharmacists and manufacturers.21 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Cohen.Senator Kohl. STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERBERT KOHLSenator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to commend you for your leadership on this issue.We have nothing short of a crisis, as we all know, in American health care costs. By and large it is those among us who are least fortunate and least able to pay who seem to bear the brunt of the costs. I've heard, as most people have, too many horror stories from senior citizens. In my own State of Wisconsin there's an elderly lady from Reedsburg who wrote in just last week and said, \"I pur- chased 12 pills for $34 less 10 percent,\" and she said, \"This is ridic- ulous, can't we do something about it?\" And there's the pharmacistwho tells about senior citizens doing without their prescriptions be- cause they can't afford them, or those trying to make the prescrip- tions last longer by cutting their doses in half.There is a pharmacist's cooperative that sent out prebid letters for competitive pricing on multisource, nongeneric drugs and didn't get one taker. They seem to be doing their share to reduce the price of the drugs to the consumer. Most pharmacists are even ab- sorbing some of the costs, so what is the problem?Well, I don't claim to understand everything about the pharma- ceutical business, but I do understand on a fundamental and moral level that people have a right to quality health care and that mil- lions of people on low and fixed incomes are getting squeezed out. I understand that Government has so~1e responsibility with the public purse. As a major purchaser of health care, the Federal Gov- ernment has to do the most it can with the least amount of money. That means getting a competitive price on prescription drugs.As a businessman, Mr. Chairman, I know that business needs in- centives to invest in things like research and development and to be innovative. I know that there are certain fixed costs that have to be covered, and I know that shareholders expect a certain return on investment. So I can appreciate the value of Federal incentives like patenting rights and research and development tax credits, as well as the importance of profitable marketing strategies. But how are all of these concerns balanced out there in the marketplace? Who is looking out after the concerns of the elderly woman from Reedsburg, WI? Who is asking if the product is worth the price, and who out there, Mr. Chairman, is setting the rules of the game? I look forward to hearing the testimony of these witnesses in an effort to get a better sense of the answers to these big questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kohl, thank you very much.Senator Pressler. STATEME!VT OF SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER Senator PRESSLER. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time I shall put my statement in the record. However, I want to commend you for holding this hearing.Also I want to state that small, independent, small town pharma- cists are not guilty of the price problem. They frequently are22 unable to obtain the same discounts that are available to large pur- chasing groups. They are at the mercy of the large companies. I be- lieve this may be an example of large companies engaging in price fixing. We need to determine if that is the reason. I commend the one company that has appeared here today. I hope we will have the cooperation of all manufacturing companies. Also, I note from the one chart here that American citizens are paying two to three times as much for their drugs than do people in the developed Western European nations. This is a surprise. We talk about the cost of medical care in this country; prescription drug costs are a critical part of the problem. I commend the chair- man and the committee for its investigation of this problem. [The prepared statement of Senator'Pressler follows:] V23 PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICINGSTATEMENT FOR SENATE AGING COMMITTEEJULY 18, 1989 LARRY PRESSLER MR. CHAIRMEN: MANY THANKS TO THE CHAIRMEN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THE PRICING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I AM PLEASED THAT THE SENATE AGING COMMITTEE IS EXAMINING THE REASONS FOR THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. MY CONSTITUENTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY REMINDING ME OF HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO PURCHASE MEDICATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THAT COSTS ARE HIGH. HOWEVER, I, LIKE MANY OTHERS, DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. RETAIL PHARMACISTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE INDEPENDENT SMALL TOWN PHARMACISTS, IN RURAL SOUTH DAKOTA, ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE SAME DISCOUNTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO LARGE PURCHASING GROUPS. WE NEED TO EXPLORE THE INTRICATE, YET SENSITIVE DIMENSIONS OF ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I HOPE THAT TODAY'S HEARING WILL ENLIGHTEN US ON THE MANY FACETS OF THIS PROBLEM. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY OF OUR EXPERT WITNESSES24 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Pressler. Senator Warner. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN WARNER Senator WARNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll submit my statement to the record. I think that my colleagues have carefully summarized the prob- lem. On the one hand you've got one of the strongest industries in America, one that is contributing in a positive way to our negative balance of payments, one that has attracted attention from all over the world because we are the world leader in producing some of the finest prescription drugs to care for the ill. On the other hand, we've got a segment of our society least able to pay that seems to be bearing a disproportionate burden of the costs. It would be my hope that the expertise that these industrial giants have brought to bear on not only on the balance of pay- ments but also the finest of drugs can now be turned to this ques- tion of marketing. Let that expertise try and guide the Congress in seeking a solution in this marketing problem rather than our strik- ing out on our own in these uncharted waters. Clearly, there is a problem. Clearly, there is a solution. Help us find it. [The prepared statement of Senator Warner follows:]25 SENATOR JOHN WARNER July 18, 1989 SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING \"PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES: ARE WE GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH?\" MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM PLEASED THAT THE COMMITTEE IS TAKING THIS TIMELY ACTION IN EXAMINING PRICING PROCEDURES FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WITH THE ADVENT OF MEDICARE COVERAGE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BEGINNING IN 1991 AND THE VAST OUTLAYS THIS WILL INVOLVE, WE MUST ENDEAVOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND PRICING AND PRODUCTION POLICIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. WHAT, EXACTLY, ARE WE IN FOR --CAN WE INDEED PROJECT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT ON THE MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MEANT TO BE AN INITIAL HEARING IN A LENGTHY OVERSIGHT INITIATIVE. THERE IS NO ACCOMPANYING LEGISLATION PROPOSING SOLUTIONS TO IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS. WE ARE HERE TO GET WHAT FACTS WE CAN TO BETTER ASSIST THE CONGRESS IN MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE NEAR FUTURE. I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (DVA). THROUGH BOTH OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROCUREMENT ARMS --THE DEPOT SYSTEM ACQUIRING BULK PHARMACEUTICAL COMMODITIES AND THE FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE SYSTEM DIRECTLY NEGOTIATING FOR PROPRIETARY AND GENERIC DRUGS --, DVA REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE SIGNIFICANT PRICE DISCOUNTS. DVA IS PRACTICING PROVEN MARKETPLACE SKILLS IN NEGOTIATING ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. THE KEY, OF COURSE INVOLVES COMPETITION AND VOLUME. WHAT THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO EXAMINE IS WHETHER ON NOT THESE MARKETPLACE TECHNIQUES CAN BE ADAPTED FOR PURPOSES OF OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS, PRINCIPALLY MEDICARE.26 THE EXAMPLE PROVIDED FOR THE COMMITTEE IN THE VITAL NEW DRUG EPOGEN MAY BE A GUIDE, BUT IT ALSO MAY PROVE TO BE AN EXCEPTION. THE HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION (HCFA) HAS AGREED TO A SIX MONTH DEMONSTRATION GUARANTEEING A NEGOTIATED PRICE FOR THE DRUG WHEN ADMINISTERED IN KIDNEY DIALYSIS. THIS IS AN ESTABLISHED MEDICARE-COVERED PROCEDURE, A CAPTIVE MARKET, IF YOU WILL, IN WHICH IT IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO IDENTIFY COSTS. WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, HOWEVER, IS HOW THESE MARKETPLACE PRINCIPLES CAN BE APPLIED FOR THE AVERAGE MEDICARE BENEFICIARY PURCHASING VARIETIES OF PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE RANGE OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS MORNING'S HEARING WILL SET US ON THE ROAD TO PROVIDING FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THE BEST DEAL WE CAN IN SECURING AFFORDABLE PRICING FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU AGAIN, AND I LOOK FOWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN WHAT WILL SURELY PROVE TO BE A VALUABLE INFORMA=ION GATHERING PROCESS.27 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Warner, thank you.Senator Graham. STATEMENT OF SENATOR BOB GRAHAM Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wish to commendyou for these very important hearings. I ask permission to submitan opening statement for the record.Mr. Chairman, I would encourage this committee to look at theefforts which have been taken by a number of States. I see thatwe're going to have the State of Kansas represented today, wherethe effort has been made to use the ability of the State and large-scale purchases to the benefit of the older citizens of those States. Ibelieve there are some important lessons there that can be appliedat a national level. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this will be a very construc-tive series of hearings. [The prepared statement of Senator Graham follows:]28 BOB GRAHAM FLOWIDA 'United itates *enatt WASHINGTON, DC 20510 OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BOB GRAHAM UNITED STATES SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING Washington, D.C. July 18, 1989 Hearing on Prescription Drug Pricing I share Chairman Pryor's concern over the ever increasing cost of prescription drugs. As Senator from the State of Florida, representing three million elderly Floridians, I am pleased to participate in this hearing. Health care costs, in general, have been continually rising for older Americans. On the average, they account for 16 percent of personal income, close to $1900 per year. For three out of four seniors in our nation, prescription drugs are the largest out-of- *pocket expense they must pay. Rising health care costs and an aging population create increasing pressures on public and private health care financing programs. While health care needs are increasing, the resources available to meet those needs are not. Because drug prices have been rising faster than economy-wide inflation since the 1970's, it is imperative that we study this component of health care costs. I look forward to hearing-from our panel of distinguished witnesses today. Their considerable expertise and testimony will help to us to better understand how prescription drugs are priced, and what role their pricing plays in overall health care costs.29 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Graham, thank you very much for yourstatement. Senator Kassebaum. STATEMENT OF SENATOR NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM Senator KASSEBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask that my full statement be made a part of the record.You obviously can tell by the interest in this hearing that you'vetouched a very sensitive nerve, and I think it's a very importantand timely hearing. I would just like to say, Mr. Chairman, briefly,that I have a rather parochial interest in this hearing. Althoughyou have many fine witnesses testifying this morning, I'm particu-larly proud of one from Kansas, Winston Barton, the head of our State's SRS program. He is accompanied by John Alquest, the Commissioner of Income Maintenance and Medical Services atKansas SRS. It is an innovative program that we have in Kansas that he willbe speaking about. It has attracted a lot of attention and I am sure it will be of great interest to the committee. It's a great pleasure tohave Mr. Barton testifying here this morning.[The prepared statement of Senator Kassebaum follows:] 31-352 0 -90 -230 Prescription Drug Prices Special Committee on Aging U.S. Senate Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum July 18, 1989 -I would like to thank Chairman Pryor for calling this very timely and important hearing on the alarming rise of prescription drug prices. -Prescription drug prices in this country are projected to jump about 9 percent in 1989. By comparision, the overall consumer price index is expected to rise only about 5 or 6 percent. Such rapid growth in drug prices has been going on for several years now, and shows only nominal. signs of slowing down. -As the implementation date for Medicare's new prescription drug benefit looms ever closer, it is imperative that we focus on the reasons for these price increases and begin examining ways to control them. -Beginning in 1991, the Medicare program will be obligated to pay a significant portion of the drug costs incurred by the nation's elderly. As we are all aware, this benefit is rapidly shaping up to be much more expensive than anyone ever anticipated. Just last week, for example, the Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting a $4.7 billion shortfall in the catastrophic drug benefit by 1993. Clearly, the problem of rising prescription drug costs is one we can ill afford to ignore. -I certainly appreciate the fact that pharmaceutical manufacturers must invest heavily in costly research in order to continue producing new and better drugs. Such medical innovation is vital to the nation's health --and it seems to me entirely reasonable that drug companies be allowed to pass at least some of this cost on to consumers. -Nevertheless, there are those who seriously question whether the current rate of price increases can be fully explained by increased expenditures on research and development. Some would even go so far as to suggest that the free market is not working in the drug industry today. These are serious questions, and I am hopeful that the witnesses here today can help this committee arrive at some valid answers. -We will hear today from a number of panelists well qualified to address the issue of rising drug prices. One of these, I am pleased to say, is Winston Barton, secretary of Social and Rehabilitation Services in my home state of Kansas. -In his two years as secretary, Mr. Barton has nurtured the, development of an innovative procedure for controlling drug expenditures in the Kansas Medicaid program. Using a system of soliciting bids from drug manufacturers, Medicaid in Kansas has begun to save significant sums of taxpayers' money. Although it is still in its infancy, the Kansas Medicaid \"bid\" program appears to hold significant promise, not only for my state, but for the nation as well. -I commend Mr. Barton for his pathbreaking work, and I look forward to his testimony, as well as that of the other witnesses. Thank you.31 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kassebaum.I believe Senator Simpson is next. STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON Senator SIMPSON. Well, Mr. Chairman, what have you been upto? I mean, I just was gone for a few weeks--The CHAIRMAN. I think this is the largest crowd of Senators that-we've ever.,had at an Aging hearing. Thank you.SenatormSIMPSON. Did you count the cameras?The CHAIRMAN. I have not counted them. [Laughter.]Senator SIMPSON. It's important. Seven camera hearings arepretty good. But I think you've done well.Well, my friend, you're embarked on one now, and Senator Pryorand I came to this remarkable place at the same time, the sameyear, and I have the deepest respect for him. I admire what hetries to do in this committee. I will ask, --Mr. Chairman, that the full text of my remarksappear in the Tecord as if read in full.We-certainly have a vexing issue here in front of us. Catastroph-ic--Health Care. We went through the anguish of crafting that bill;we heard the figures. You know, not everyone over 60 is in direpoverty in the United States. And I do get so tired of listening to somany special interest groups somehow trying to impel us along theroad that everybody over 60 is in poverty, and just barely scratch-ing through in this terrible society. That's not true.There are people who are in poverty, but we spend a lot of timetrying to find them to help them, or else we wouldn't have abudget of $1.2 trillion and a vote on a debt. limit extension nextmonth of $3.2 trillion. Now, that's what the debt limit extension ofthe United States is, and we'll vote on it next month, and it's $3.2trillion. We are a pretty generous country. Unfortunately, we havepeople who don't always play the game like others should.-I don't know what we'll find here, Mr. Chairman, but the drug.benefit is an important part of Catastrophic, and we're going toreview that. These great divergences in price are rather stunningto me. I chaired the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I just don't knowhow you can take the same pill and peddle it at eight- differentprice levels, and how that's right. And I really am interested in thedifference between R&D and revenue, and profit, and I think itwould be well worth investigating to see what we will 'come upwith. And ifiwe find that, as we crafted it, the Catastrophic Act as-sures that Government will pay -top premium dollar, I'm going to'be totally offended by that if that's the gimmickry that goes on,and these are the same guys that come shrieking around and hang-ing around our office like.poor relatives asking about the deficit.[Laughter.] * They are -in it up to their ham- hocks if that's the case. I think Iwant to be right in -the middle, helping to see what we can do withthat. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.[The prepared statement of Senator Simpson follows:]32' Prepared statement of Senator Simpson Thank you, Chairman Pryor, for calling this important and timely hearing on prescription drug prices and purchasing arrangements. The new coverage of prescription drugs enacted under the Catastrophic Coverage Act is an important addition to the Medicare benefit package. However, CBO's recent cost estimates of the drug benefit suggest that, using the reimbursement formula spelled out in the law, we will have great difficulty supporting that benefit with scheduled revenues. Under the existing reimbursement formula, in fact, the program will run a deficit of nearly $3 billion by 1992. Mr. Chairman, the drug benefit is important -- some argue that it is the most important -- protection for senior citizens contained in the new Catastrophic law. However, some are already arguing for repeal of this benefit based on deficit projections for the program. Before we take such drastic action, Mr. Chairman, perhaps we should reexamine whether our reimbursement mechanism assures efficient purchases on behalf of beneficiaries and guarantees maximum value for the dollar. The federal government, by its sheer size, has awesome purchasing power and thus ought to be able to negotiate some of the best prices in the market -- without resorting to some sort of regulatory price fixing scheme. However, recent investigations by this Committee, HHS, and other Congressional committees suggest that we may have crafted a Medicare payment policy for prescription drugs that virtually assures that Medicare will pay top dollar for pharmaceuticals. In addition, while crafting the Catastrophic Act, the Committees paid little attention to the relative value of the thousands of drug products for which Medicare will pay under this new law. Mr. Chairman, that is not wise policy. If this Committee's inquiry reveals that we have crafted a policy that has the federal government paying exhorbitant prices for pharmaceuticals of questionable value, then we should revisit that policy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.33 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Simpson.Our first panel is here today. I'm going to limit each witness to 3minutes. .Well, let me first.tell you folks about our first panel. Our firstpanel consists of persons who can get, or at least try to get reducedprices not only, Senator Simpson, for the Government, but also forthe consumer. Our first witness is Dennis Styrsky, Chief of Phar-maceutical Products Division at the Department of Veterans Af-fairs, who will discuss what price discounts are at the Veterans Ad-ministration. We salute you, by the way, Mr. Styrsky, at being ableto receive them. Next will be Winston Barton, Secretary of the Kansas Depart-ment of Social and Rehabilitation Services, who will describe his* State's innovative Medicaid bidding program, unlike any other inthe country, and also the mixed success that he has had in obtain-ing-reduced pricing from the drug manufacturers.The final member is William Mincy, a partner in the LencoGroup consulting firm, who will describe how well the retail phar-macy buying groups have fared in securing discounts from the drugmanufacturers. The full body of your statements will be placed in the record, aswill all opening statements of our members of the Aging Commit-tee this morning. Mr. Styrsky, you see the little green light. That means you're on.That's your warning, and then I'm going to have to cut you off in 5minutes. STATEMENT OF DENNIS STYRSKY, CHIEF, PHARMACEUTICALPRODUCTS DIVISION, MARKETING CENTER, DEPARTMENT OFVETERANS AFFAIRS, HINES, IL Mr. STYRSKY. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I ampleased to be here today to discuss the issues- related to prescrip-tion drug pricing and the Department of Veterans Affairs ~procure-ment program for prescription drugs.Our mission is to provide drugs by the most economic method ofsupply to the Government customer by either contracting for depotstock or Federal supply schedule. In contracting for our -depotstocked single source pharmaceutical products, discounts-vary from22 to 90 percent when compared to the average wholesale price, thevariance being based on the manufacturers' pricing policies andwillingness to negotiate for a market they- possess. -For -multiplesource drugs we typically obtain discounts ranging-from 39 to 93percent. We have analyzed the cost of drugs from.1981tto the present foritems in our depot distribution system. It is difficult to identify atrend in the cost because variables such as competition have a dra-matic effect. It is relatively safe to identify single source drug costsas increasing annually. We believe the contracting efforts by the Department of Veter-ans Affairs support efficiency and effectiveness in our program,since we have -contained overall drug 'costs within- or Fbelow thetotal marketplace. 'The effect of competition for, multiple sourcedrugs is evident through cost reduction. Multiple source drug34 prices have declined in our depot system an average of 51.7 percent below those prices paid in 1981 for the comparable brand name item. In preparation for single source drug negotiations we obtain as much information as possible concerning the current pricing of the drugs for which we. are contracting. This is accomplished by re- viewing commercial publications such as the Drug Topics Redbook and a monthly publication which provides updates on brand name prices from Medispan. We also review the current Producer Price Index and prior year pricing as a minimum to prepare ourselves for negotiation. Generic drugs are reviewed the same way, but there is no question that the existence of competition is the driving force in negotiating the best prices for generics. Market awareness and price analysis confirm the reasonableness of the contract award, but if the offerors were not in direct price competition, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be in a less advantageous position. Recently the Waxman-Hatch Act has had a positive influence in stimulating the introduction of generic drugs and the effect is very noticeable. Competition and large volume are the keys to favorable prices. Our negotiations are always carried out with the best inter- est of the Government in mind while recognizing the need for a win/win end results The Department of Veterans Affairs negotiates and manages its Federal supply schedules for drugs and pharmaceuticals under the format prescribed by the General Services Administration. Obtain- ing a Federal supply schedule contract for a proprietary product line on a multiple award schedule requires the disclosure, of dis- counting practices for all classes of trade. Bidders complete a dis- count schedule and marketing data section of the solicitation with this information. We have developed a computer program which performs a price analysis of the drugs and compares the Govern- ment's position to the most favored customer supplied by the of- feror. It also determines a negotiation objective for Government based on the analysis and prices offered other customers. The use of this program has enhanced our ability to negotiate under the Federal supply schedule and obtain better pricing for the Federal customer. Our generic drug Federal supply schedule identifies the specific items we intend to have under contract. Offerors provide a price only. Since no disclosure data exists, we determine an average com- mercial price from all suppliers identified through the Redbook. This represents the maximum price determined reasonable for Government, and negotiations are conducted with suppliers to obtain an equal to or better price. If this is attained, the item is awardable. If not, no award is made to that supplier. Our Federal supply schedule assignments are of the multiple award type because there are subtle differences even in therapeutic equivalent drugs. Buffering agents and tablet compression can be variables that are not addressed by the compendia. Generally the Department of Veterans Affairs obtains discounts through its Federal supply schedule program averaging 41 percent for single source prescription drugs and 67 percent for multiple source drugs when measured against wholesale prices. We wish to35 emphasize that these prices represent the cost to the Governmentthrough commercial distribution channels and not drugs ownedand distributed through depot stock.Up to this point I have emphasized the positive factors in the De- partment's drug acquisition program; however, we do have to con-.tend with certain adversity such as manufacturers that choose notto participate in either the Federal supply schedule.. or our -depotdistribution program. We meet these circumstances by seekingnal-ternative sources that may be manufacturing the products whichthe Department requires. Success is unfortunately very limited.The single -problem encountered in negotiating with manufactur-ers generally relates, to the market share Department of VeteransAffairs Medical Centers represent.* The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Styrsky, I apologize. I'm going to have to-'our red light is on. We do have some questions and the full body ofyour statement will be placed in the record. I really appreciateyour testimony, and we salute the VA for this very, -very goodbuying program. [The prepared statement of Mr. Styrsky follows:] 3 3See appendix 2, p. 348 for further information and answers to questions by the Department of Veterans Affairs.36 STATEMENT OF. DENNIS M. STYRSKY CHIEF, PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS DIVISION MARKETING CENTER DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS BEFORE THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING UNITED STATES SENATE JULY 13, 1989 Mr. Chairman and' Members of the Committee: I an pleased to be here today to discuss the issues related to prescription drug pricing and the Department of Veterans Affairs procurement program for prescription drugs. The Department of Veterans Affairs contracts and obtains drugs for its depot distribution program in support of the Medical Center network and other Government ordering offices. Also the Department has been delegated the Federal Supply Schedule responsibility for drugs and pharmaceuticals. We accomplish this by cost effective use of two multiple award Federal Supply Schedules, a commercial style catalog which is primarily for proprietary product lines and a Schedule of known generics with substantial use potential. This organizational structure provides total commodity management and a full overview of the Federal drug marketplace. Our mission is to provide drugs by the most economic method of supply to the Government customer by either contracting for depot stock or Federal Supply Schedule. In contracting for our depot stocked single source pharmaceutical products, discounts vary from 22% to 90% when compared 'with the average wholesale price, the variance being based on the manufacturers' pricing policies and willingness to negotiate for a market they possess. For multiple source drugs we typically obtain discounts ranging from 39% to 93%, but most multiple source drugs in our depots are currently being purchased with discounts of greater than 80% from Average Wholesale Price. We have analyzed the cost of drugs from 1981 to the present for items in our depot distribution system. It is difficult to identify a trend in cost because variables such as competition have a dramatic effect. It is relatively safe to identify single source drug costs as increasing annually.37 The VA and the Department of Defense have bee.n actively involved in Shared Procurement for drugs and medical supplies since 1978. The Departments consolidate their requirements and assign contracting responsibility to one subordinate office, either the VA Marketing -Center or Defense Personnel Support Center, Directorate of Medical Materiel. The program has been effective in maintaining reasonable prices for drugs. The Public Health Service was added to the agreement in 1984 and has been a user of the contracts negotiated by'VA and DoD. Public Health Service has become actively involved in contracting through the vaccine acquisitions for childhood immunization. The. Public Health Service's role is being expanded and soon they will absorb a greater portion of the contracting responsibility for drugs previously done by VA and DoD. We would like to address three drugs on ohe committee's list. Atenolol, 50 mg, ll0's, Dilitiazem Tabs, 60 mg, l00s, and Digoxin Tabs, .25 mg, 1088's are single source drugs that have been in the Department's depot distribution system for different periods of time. We have contracted for Atenolol since 1985, and it is currently costing the Department of Veterans Affairs 349 more than it did in 1985. Dilitiazen Tabs has been in the depot system since 1983, and the price has increased a total of 28% over the six.yeat period. DigoXin has increased 656% iince 1981 as_ a directed, source procurement -for. the brand name Lanoxin but Jo still 22% below the Average. Wholesale Price. These drugsI' overall are well within and below the Producer Price Index for prescription drug products which has increased an average of 9.5-13% annually for the past 10 years. We believe the drastic increase in the price of Digoxin is related to the exceptionally low price that existed during the early 1981's. Increased zv demand associated with -an aging population necessitated price adjustments for profitability in a relatively short time. Digoxim is reviewed annually prior to contract award and the pricing offered VA is consistently the best price available. We believe the contracting efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs support efficiency and effectiveness in our program since we have contained overall costs withijn or below the total marketplace. The effect of competition for multiple source drugs is evident through. cost reduction. Multiple source drug prices have declined in our depot -system an average of -51.1% belowthose prices paid in 1981 for the comparable brand name item.38 In preparation for single source drug negotiations, we obtain as much information as possible concerning the current pricing of the drugs for which we are contracting. This is accomplished by reviewing connercial publications such as the fDrug Topics Redbook' and a monthly publication which provides updates on brand name prices from 'Medispan'. We also review the current Producer Price Index and prior year pricing as a minimum to prepare ourselves for negotiation. Generic drugs are reviewed the same way, but there is no question that the existence of competition is the driving force in negotiating the best prices for generics. Market awareness and price analysis confirm the reasonableness of the contract award, but, if the offerors were not in direct price competition, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be in a less advantageous position. The Waxman Hatch Act has had a positive influence in stimulating the introduction of generic drugs and the effect is very noticeable. Competition and large volume are the keys to favorable prices. Our negotiations are always carried out with the best interest of the Government in mind while.recognizing the need for a 'win/win' end result. The Department of Veterans Affairs negotiates and manages its Federal Supply Schedules for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals under the format prescribed by the General Services Administration. Obtaining a Federal Supply Schedule contract for a proprietary product line on a multiple award schedule requires the disclosure of discounting practices for all classes of trade. Bidders complete a Discount Schedule and Marketing Data section of the solicitation with this information. We have developed a computer program which performs a price analysis of the drugs and compares the Government's position to the nmost favored customer- supplied by the offeror. It also determines a negotiation objective for Government based on the analysis and prices offered other customers. The use of this program has enhanced our ability to negotiate under the Federal Supply Schedule and obtain better pricing for the Federal customer. our generic drug Federal Supply Schedule identifies the specific items we intend to have under contract. Offerors provide a price only. Since no disclosure data exists, we determine an average commercial price from all suppliers identified through the SRedbook'. 'This represents the maximum price determined reasonable for Government, -and negotiations are conducted with suppliers to obtain an equal to or better price. If this is attained, the item is awardable. If not, no award is made to that supplier. Our Federal Supply Schedule assignments are of the multiple award type because there are subtle differences even in therapeutic equivalent drugs. Buffering agents and tablet compression can be variables that are not addressed by the compendia.39 To substantially strengthen the Government's ability to obtain lower prices, we have required all manufacturers and distributors interested in contracting under the proprietary Federal Supply Schedule program to provide-their actual commercial sales.'data to the Government. for any item they propose to include in their contract. Items with less than. $2,000 in annual sales to Government will not be considered for award, nor will a contractor who cannot provide more than $25,000 annually in total Government sales. The significance of these thresholds relates to the need for the specific item. The annual sales must exceed the Small Purchase Authority prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Failing in either of these categories makes the cost to negotiate, award and administer a contract unfavorable for the Department of Veterans Affairs since any Federal ordering office could make a single purchase under the Small Purchase Authority for the entire Government. Conversely, we identify those products for which the Government makes substantial purchases, and we negotiate on the strength of this volume. Generally toe Department of Veterans Affairs obtains discounts through its Federal Supply Schedule program averaging 41% for single source prescription drugs and 67% for multiple source drugs when measured against wholesale prices. We wish to emphasize that these prices represent the cost to the Government through commercial distribution channels and not drugs owned and distributed through depot stock. We are reducing the cost to contract with the Government by eliminating duplication of contracting within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our goal is to make our organization more effective by bringing basic business principles and procedures into Government contracting. Use of Federal Supply Schedule requote and tiered pricing procedures established by the General Services Administration has given usa the ability to reduce the costs associated with doing business with Government. This has established the significance of the Federal Supply Schedule contract, and, through this and traditional contracting methods, we maintain total support for the Department of Veterans Affairs and all other Executive Branch Federal activities. The benefits of the requote/tiered pricing procedures are: 1. Establishes through Multiple Award Federal Supply Schedule the broadest competitive base from which single a-ard contracts can be awarded.40 2. Accomplishes all special program functions more economically and efficiently such as adding items in support of central distribution. 3. Presents a single face to industry of total Government requirements through a uniform method of contracting with one primary Government contracting activity. 4. Reduces duplication of effort and resources by Government and Industry to provide pharmaceuticals for various delivery systems. S. naxinizes Government leverage in negotiations and provides the needed flexibility to react and acquire generic equivalents when they enter the nurketplace resulting in quick response to changing market conditions and lower cost. Up to this point, I have emphasized the positive factors in the Department's drug acquisition program; however, we do have to contenC with certain adversity such as manufacturers that choose not to participate in either the Federal Supply Schedule or our depot distribution program. We meet these circumstances by seeking alternative sources that may be manufacturing the products which the Department requires. Success is unfortunately very limited. The single problem encountered in negotiating with manufacturers generally relates to the market share Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers represent. A decade ago, VA was 1 of the 5 largest customers to the pharmaceutical industry. Today, due to the consortia, buying groups and Health Maintenance Organizations, it is not even among the 10 largest buying organizations in the United States for drugs and pharmaceutical products. We believe the the closed system of drug acquisition by the Department of Veterans Affairs in its business dealings assist us in overcoming the this obstacle hen negotiating our prices. For the convenience of the committee, the responses to the six questions forwarded by the staff are attached. I appreciate the opportunity to provide this information to the committee.41 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Winston Barton, .Secretary of the Kansas De-partment of Social and Rehabilitation.Mr. Barton. STATEMENT OF WINSTON BARTON, SECRETARY AND CHIEF EX-ECUTIVE OFFICER, KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND RE-HABILITATION SERVICES, ACCOMPANIED BY JOHN ALQUEST,COMMISSIONER, KANSAS MEDICAL PROGRAM Mr. BARTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of thecommittee. I am Winston Barton, Secretary of the Kansas Depart-ment of Social and Rehabilitation Services. With me is John Al-quest, our Commissioner of Income Maintenance and Medical Serv-ices. SRS is an umbrella.agency responsible for public social serv-ices, which includes the Medicaid Program in Kansas.The primary reason. I am here today is that I believe we all havean obligation to consider ways to contain or reduce expenditures inthe Medicaid prescription drug program. We must address the rateof inflation in the cost of drug products and the need to provide abalanced health care program for the needy within the limits of State and national resources. Available funding for health careservices is not unlimited. The major area of the program I want ito report to you thismorning relates to our efforts in establishing.bidding procedureswhich we feel.are unique. You have a copy of our report that re-veals details on the program. Therefore, I will not elaborate so-much on how it works, but briefly describe some of the obstacleswe have encountered in starting this initiative.Our bid program is somewhat different than traditional bid pro-grams in that the State does not buy directly from pharmaceutical-manufacturers. The mechanism is, however, quite simple. First, weissue-an invitation to bid; the bid winner is selected; a sole sourcecontract is signed; the providers, the physicians and pharmacists,are notified of which products are covered, and told of-the compa-rable products that.are not covered; claims are submitted by thepharmacist to the State for each prescription dispensed utilizingthe National, Drug Code; the State Medicaid fiscal agent calculatesthe units and cost from the providers, that's the pharmacist whosubmits a claim to the St-ate; the bid winner, the-manufacturer, isinvoiced for the difference between the accepted bid and the reimn-bursement amount from the claims submitted by the pharmacist;the bid winner, the -manufacturer, reimburses the State on -amonthly or quarterly basis the difference between-the bid and theamount paid to. the pharmacist by the State.In this system, everyone participating wins. The pharmacist has.purchased his supply from his usual source and is paid his usualcost.-The recipient obtains his prescription without delay. SRS hasreduced the final cost of the drug product. The bid winner can beassured of a steady volume of business during the term of the con-tract. The major obstacle in starting the program was the strong resist-ance from.the major pharmaceutical companies. The brand namecompanies have generally not been interested in bidding. In arecent discussion with a pharmaceutical representative it was sug-42 gested that his company should support a Medicaid bid program and become very competitive, not only in Kansas, but in all States. His reply was simply that his company was not interested. It was difficult to understand why a company would not be interested in a potential national bid contract that could. exceed $200 million an- nually for one drug. One reason pharmaceutical companies are not interested is that it will cut into their profits, especially if they lose the bid. As you know, most medical providers who serve Medicare and Medicaid re- cipients do not make a profit, and many lose money. For example, hospitals and nursing homes would probably go out of business if their total patient load were Medicaid and Medicare clients be- cause Government payments frequently do not cover costs. Physi- cians in many States receive only about one-half their normal fees when they care for Medicaid recipients. Most pharmacists are for- tunate to cover actual costs when they fill prescriptions for Medic- aid recipients. I contend that pharmaceutical companies are the only entity in the health care field that do not pay their fair share in meeting the health care needs of the poor of this country. Bidding of prescription drugs has a much greater cost savings po- tential than we have developed so far in Kansas. Our State expend- itures in fiscal year 1989 will exceed $27 million for prescribed drugs for Medicaid recipients. Nationally, over $2.8 billion is spent annually by the Federal and State Governments for prescribed drugs for Medicaid recipients. Our bid program in Kansas will only save a few hundred thou- sand dollars this year, primarily due to the lack of participation by the pharmaceutical companies. However, I believe there's a poten- tial savings in Kansas of $2 million to $4 million annually. On a national level the savings to the State and Federal Governments could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Kansas pays over $2 million a year for ulcer medicine that we refer to as H2 antagonists. If the State could receive a bid savings of 25 percent, which is very realistic, the State could save $500,000 on this one drug. Nationally, States pay over $200 million for the ulcer medicines for Medicaid recipients. A 25 percent savings would be $50 million. Expand that savings to other prescribed drugs, and it is not difficult to realize the potential savings. I believe the Kansas bid program could be designed to fit the needs of most all State Medicaid programs and-of great concern to you and your committee, Mr. Chairman-it could be made to work in the Medicare Program. Mr. Chairman, I have two recommendations on how your com- mittee can help States develop their bid programs. One, encourage the Health Care Financing Administration to promulgate regula- tions that encourage States to implement bid programs. Two, through legislation provide a higher FFP for prescribed drugs to States that contain or reduce cost through bidding. And finally, Mr. Chairman, I recommend you encourage HCFA to actively seek ways to incorporate a bidding procedure in the Medicare Program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Barton follows:]43 State of Kansas Depa-tment of Social and Rehabilitation Services Winston Barton, Secretary The Kansas Medicaid Prescription Drug Bid/Contract Process The Kansas Medicaid bid/contract program for pharmaceuticals administered by the State Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) is an innovative appreach to cost containment for the Medicaid Prescription Drug Program. The bidding process, however, has been in use in other applications such as hospitals and buying cooperatives for many years. This program is a combination of a standard invitation for bid and contract award along with the \"chargeback\" system used by buying groups. The difference between the Kansas Medicaid Bid/Contract Program and other bid programs is that the Medicaid Program does not take delivery of drugs. Cost concessions from drug manufacturers are based on claims submitted by Pharmacy Providers for specified products, which have been dispensed to Medicaid recipients from the pharmacies' regular inventory. The bid winning manufacturer is then invoiced by the Medicaid Program for the difference between the reimbursed inventory cost and the contracted price. This \"adjustment\" payment is returned to the Kansas Department of- Social and Rehabilitation Services. The -rationale for development of a Medicaid Bid/Contract Program is that many state agencies and institutions providing health care services, and specifically pharmacy services, receive discounted pricing for drug products from pharmaceutical manufacturers in response to requests for bids. Reduced cost pharmaceutical contracts are also available to many other not-for-profit as well as for-profit health care organizations; but they, like the Kansas institutions,44 take possession of the drugs contracted. The question was how could the Medicaid Program receive the reduced cost benefit from these or separate bids without violating federal antitrust laws, such as the Robinson Patman statutes on discriminatory pricing? The concept developed is a system that does not interfere with normal drug distribution channels nor pricing practices to pharmacies by manufacturers or drug wholesalers, and thus Robinson Patman is not violated. This concept does not alter the reimbursement system or the level of payments to pharmacy providers. The bid arrangement and cost adjustment is between the pharmaceutical manufacturers and SRS. This is a unique approach to containment of drug product costs which has not been implemented by any other Medicaid program. Projections of potential cost savings are significant, Attachment (1). This program seeks to reduce costs at a logical point in the distribution channel. The provider pharmacies' dispensing fees have remained relatively flat, but the cost of the total program has doubled within a few years due to continuing price increases by pharmaceutical manufacturers. This is true even though recipient benefits have been reduced. Many drugs are now going off of patent, with a consequent reduction in cost of availability due to a competitive market, but the newly-marketed drugs are so expensive as to cause double-digit inflation in total prescription drug cost each year. If the extraordinary inflation of drug costs is to be controlled, it must be at the manufacturing level. The bid program reduces costs without sacrificing quality or hurting providers of pharmacy services. However, it has been met with much resistance from individual companies and special interest groups of the pharmaceutical industry. 245 Although a few brand name pharmaceutical companies have submitted bids, most have reacted negatively when asked to give the state social services agency the benefit of the lower costs charged to other public and private institutions. Individually and through their primary trade association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), they have actively fought against the concept of bidding for Medicaid contracts even when they are competitively bidding for other government and private contracts. Lobbying of the state legislature concerning pharmaceuticals has been heavy in Kansas as well as in other states where some form of cost control of pharmaceuticals has been actively pursued. While the above-described concept has been received with significant resistance from the brand name pharmaceutical manufacturing community, it is of interest that during the late 60s and early 70s a very similar type of arrangement was in effect with many of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers. During this time period, they provided to the agency a cost adjustment, percentage rebate, or participation payment (whatever term may be appropriate), based on the dollar volume of their products reimbursed to providers of pharmacy services for Medicaid prescriptions. One consideration provided to manufacturers for participation in the program was that their total product line would be included as covered services. This program was discontinued primarily due to the desire of manufacturers. A reason for their reluctance to continue participation at that time was pressure they felt from pharmacy practitioners concerning discriminatory pricing practices. However, other multi-tier pricing structures by pharmaceutical manufacturers are still common. Recent information on pricing indicated some companies currently have eight different classes or tiers: retailers, wholesalers, chain wholesalers, maii order, nursing homes, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO), hospitals and physicians. Although not46 necessarily ranked in the order listed, retailers invariably will have legal access only to the highest levels of wholesale prices. The multisource (generic) pharmaceutical'manufacturers, individually and through the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association (GPIA), have not to our knowledge actively lobbied against our bid program. In fact, they seem to recognize the realities of this competitive opportunity. They clearly urderstand their disadvantage in programs where the prescriber can override maximum cost limits. One of the most controversial, but certainly one of the most cost-effective, facets of the Kansas bid program is competitive bidding of therapeutic alternate produes. First, I must explain that this program does not require or imply that, thezpharmacist substitute, drugs, that are not generically equivalent. In other words, ' therapeutic substitution Jby the pharmacist is not involved. Howeveri the pharmacist will, on occasions when the prescriber orders a drug not covered due to the bid program, contact the prescriber and suggest that a new order for the covered product be issued. Therapeutic alternates are drugs that are neither generically nor therapeutically (by FDA- standards) equivalent. Therapeutic alternates are different drug entities that are used to obtain the same results. For example, none of the Histamine-Two Antagonist (H2A) drugs that are currently available for treatment of ulcers are generic or therapeutic equivalents. However, unbiased experts indicate that they can all be used to obtain the same results. The Kansas Medicaid Program did not receive an acceptable bid from the H 2A 447 manufacturers, so the manufacturer with the lowest price on these therapeutic alternates was selected to be the sole source provider for one year. Another therapeutic alternate class did have an acceptable bid. The multiple brand and generic products of sustained-release potassium chloride that are available make it a highly competitive field in which to market a new -or old - product. A new brand from a reputable manufacturer was accepted on the bid/contract program. In sustained-release form, most of the potassium products are neither generically or therapeutically equivalent. They are, however, therapeutic alternative products for potassium supplementation. This brand has more recently been declared by the FDA to be therapeutically equivalent to the reference product. In addition to therapeutic alternates, bids are invited for generically equivalent products. Generic equivalent drugs can be further divided into multisource products for which the patent has expired, and licensed duplicate drugs. Duplicate drugs are generically equivalent drugs sold under more than one brand name, and marketed by different subsidiaries of the patent holder, or by different companies under license from the patent holder. When a sole-source contract is in effect, only the specific National Drug Code (NDC) numbered products contracted for are covered. Other products, whether they are generically or therapeutically equivalent, or are therapeutic alternates, are noncovered as specified in the contract. To rephrase my earlier statement, the pharmacist is not authorized to change a prescriber's order, even when it is for a product noncovered due to the bid program. The pharmacist may, however, contact the prescriber to obtain a new prescription for the covered 548 product, so that it can be dispensed and billed under the Medicaid Prescription Drug Program. The original group of drugs for which bids were invited in 1987 was selected to represent several therapeutic classes, and different marketing categories (prescription required or no prescription required), as well as therapeutic alternate drugs, and, of course, generically equivalent drugs, from both multisource manufacturers and licensed duplicate drugs. Not all drugs, either branded or multisource, will have therapeutic. alternates available. The list of \"biddable\" drugs is not infinite, but it can be expanded over the list used each of the past two years. The Kansas.,Medicaid Prescription Drug Bid Program has delayed its.bid invitation -tfor 1989-1990 because of interest expressed by several states in joining in a -,- rpossible multistate bid program. We have developed a questionnaire for distribution to determine if enough interest exists to undertake such a concept on a multistate basis. Kansas Attorney General Opinion #89-74, Attachment (2), concerning such a multistate. program bas been received, and we will proceed to determine the commitment of other states to this concept. lAwletteiMAttachment (3), is enclosed, witn information similar to that sent to other states who have requested data about the Kansas Bid Program. I have also enclosed, Attachment (4), the invitation for bid letter from March,._AS88 which gives the full details of the contract. Item 10 on Page 3 f:.dthhe Special Conditions section defines the'.-key provision of Adjustments to -Contract Payment.49 The obvious incentive for a manufacturer to bid is that the agency will include as covered pharmacy program services only those products with a successful bid. The bid winner becomes the sole-source provider for the term of the contract. This, of course, translates into a significant increase in the bid winner's sales. The Kansas program is two years old, and covers only a half-dozen products. Bidding has the potential to produce much greater savings to the Medicaid Program than has currently been demonstrated.50 Federal Upper Limits (FUL) on Drug Reimbursement The aggregate upper limits of payment for drugs as specified by HHS, HCFA, in 42 CFR, 447.331 and 332, refers to both multiple-source drugs specifically listed, and \"other drugs\", which include those multiple-source drugs not specifically listed and other-than-multiple-source drugs. \"Other Drugs\" are limited in reimbursement to the Estimated Acquisition Cost (EAC). Since definitions of EAC vary from state to state, reimbursement levels for \"other drugs\" may not be consistent between the states. An enclosed copy of HHS Secretary Sullivan's recent letter to Charles West of the National Association of Retail Druggists (NARD), Attachment (5), indicates that an unmodified Average Wholesale Price (AWP) will not be acceptable as the Estimated Acquisition Cost (EAC). Despite the very active opposition by pharmacies and their organizations, we feel that most pharmacists will accept the decision to reimburse at an Estimated Actual Acquisition Cost (EAAC) if an adequate dispensing fee, based on actual costs, is funded. The federal government and mank states developed Maximum Allowable Costs (MAC) several years back. The- federal MAC was not expanded until the new Federal Upper Limits (FUL) was implemented in October 1987. Many states, however, took the lead in broadening the scope of pharmaceutical cost control using State Maximum Allowable Costs .(SMAC) .Some SMACs are little different from Average Wholesale Price (AWP),, and few are as low as the FUL, but many states also SMAC a- broader list of drugs than required by the FUL. regulations. States have51 implemented many other cost-containment measures, also. Kansas has taken the lead in implementing a Medicaid Bidding Program as a cost reduction program. The portion of this regulation which concerns those multiple-source drugs specifically listed under Section 447.332 is certainly the subject of many criticisms by provider pharmacies, their suppliers and Medicaid programs. Generally, the criticisms are towards the mechanisms, more than the philosophy of setting 'ceiling\" prices, however. There are, of course, many prescribers and recipients who resent having their prerogatives restricted in any manner. There are pharmacies, likewise, which resent the restrictions and the extra work that inevitably goes with any restriction. There are also those partisans of the brand name manufacturers who do not believe the FDA ratings on therapeutic equivalency of generically equivalent drugs.. In today's marketplace these types of objections usually result from some form of self-interest or refusal to accept reality. The need for reasonable and consistent cost control is clearly evident. There are many objections voiced to the mechanisms of implementation of cost limits for drugs listed pursuant to Section 447.332 that do need more consideration. Listed below, not necessarily in order of importance, are several problems generated by the Federal Upper Limits (FUL). Availability to the pharmacy provider of the listed drug at or below the listed cost. The federal formula of 150% over the lowest cost found anywhere nationally sounds generous, and may be in a highly competitive wholesale market area such as Baltimore. Such availability is not consistent nationally. Many pharmacists from rural states have complained about lack of availability at52 appropriate prices in their region. For those pharmacists who can buy their products at the lower prices available, a potential 50% markup on cost is extra gross profit that the less fortunate pharmacies will not receive. The aggregate features of reimbursement -audits make it essential to have sophisticated computerized capability to track the 400 drug entities currently listed (usually with multiple NDCs). If one drug is not available at the Federal-Upper 'Limit (FUL), or for other reasons the FUL is not implemented, other drug prices can be cut below the FUL. However it is not just a simple exchange. The volume of each drug's use and the respective variances above and below the FUL must balance out at payments no greater in aggregate than if all were reimbursed -at the listed price. Simply stated, it is complicated to implement any variance, no matter how important such a variance might be. For .our system, we found it necessary to purchase a previously unneeded pricing service, and make extensive computer programming additions.' It still takes too long to calculate the effect any variatioin -pricing will have or to implement new price lists during the.- unreasonably short time allowed 'before the implementation date. The pharmacies must, of course,I be notified of -the new prices on a timely basis, also. Another factor is updating costs based on market conditions as they change. When the lowest available cost increases coincidentally with, or shortly after a new price list is published, the pharmacy may be either reimbursed at less than his cost -or more likely -will refuse to dispense, and the recipient is denied a benefit. Some states have statutes that prevent the pharmacist from -dispensing generically for certain drug classes, such as the Schedule II narcotics. Also many individual pharmacies, as well, as both prescribers and -their patients, object to the principle of \"brand exchange\" for specific products, as may be necessary to stay within the cost limitations. While this feeling is exceptionally strong for anticonvulsants and oral contraceptives, it also occurs with almost any multisource drug. Much of this involves emotional feelings, rather than factual considerations. It is, however, a frequently heard argument that will probably continue as long as-ceiling costs continue.53 Kansas Medicaid Prescription Drug Cost Reduction Program S U M M A R Y There are many forms of cost controls that can be, and have been, implemented. This testimony centers on reduction of costs through bid contracts and ceiling costs as implemented both at the state and federal levels. The bid program promotes competition, and does not eliminate the possibility of brand name drug versions of generically available products being the low bid. Invariably a cost ceiling such a, SMAC or F UL will eliminate the brand names on the basis of published cost. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (C ?A) and their brand name manufacturer members have not acknowledged this bidding system as a competitive opportunity. The formulas for selecting and pricing drugs for the multisource list creates numerous inequities between ( 1) drug products listed and those similar products not listed and (2) in availability within cost limitations in different geographic regions.54 ATTACHMENT (1) 'Bid Adjustments.

Under a rule of reason analysis the proposed bid program may survive an antitrust challenge. The proposed program should be conducted in a manner that renders the market more, rather than less, competitive and does not allow one manufacturer to unlawfully possess market power to the exclusion of its competitors. Cited herein: 15 U.S.C. 5 1-27. * * * -' Dear Secretary Barton: You request our -opinion concerning a proposed pharmaceutical bid program and extension of that bid program to other states57 Winston Barton Page 2 wishing to participate. You specifically ask whether the bidprocess and the extension of the process to other statesviolates antitrust laws. Pursuant to conversations with and correspondence from theDepartment of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) andits legal staff, we understand that the bid process works asfollows: SRS solicits and accepts separate bids on each ofcertain specific drugs from any and all manufacturers of thatdrug; each drug is separately bid; bids will be accepted on the generic equivalent as well as the therapeutic version ofeach drug; the manufacturer who submits the winning bid oneach drug will become the only manufacturer of that drug that SRS will reimburse (when that manufacturer's brand of thedrug is used by Medicaid/ Medixan recipients); only onemanufacturer for each type of drug will be so designated andSRS will not reimburse for brands of the same drugmanufactured by unsuccessful bidders; when a participatingprovider-pharmacist dispenses the designated drug to aMedicaid/MediKan recipient, that Medicaid/Medisanrecipient must pay a flat co-payment fee to the pharmacist;the provider-pharmacist then submits a claim to SRS; SRSreimburses the participating provider-pharmacist for the costsof the designated drug that the co-payment fee did notcover; SRS then takes all the claims it has received fromparticipating provider-pharmacists and submits those claimsand amounts to the bid winner for each drug; the winning drugmanufacturer then gives a rebate to SRS for the differencebetween the amount SRS paid to the provider-pharmacist andthe amount of the winning bid price. For example: (1) the winning bid is accepted from amanufacturer at $1.00 per unit for drug Z; (2) drug Z is soldby the manufacturer to a participating provider-pharmacist for$2.50 per unit; (3) a Medicaid/MediKan recipient buys drug Zfrom that participating provider-pharmacist, who charges a retail price for the drug of $5.00 per unit; (4) theMedicaid/MediSan patient pays the required flat feeco-payment of .50 cents per unit; (5) the participatingprovider-pharmacist submits a claim for the unpaid cost of thedrug, $4.50 or $2.00 (dependent upon whether SRS reimburseswholesale or retail costs); (6) SRS submits a claim to thewinning manufacturer for the difference between theprovider-pharmacist claim ($4.50 or $2.00) and the winning bid($1.00), $3.50 or $1.00. The amount paid from the winningmanufacturer to the state is characterized as a rebate. Therebate paid to SRS from the winning bid manufacturer will bepaid to the state general fund.58 Winston Barton Page , SRS believes this bid program will result in cost containment for the state and has used this drug bid procedure for almost two years. Approximately 95% of all Kansas pharmacies participate in supplying drugs to Medicaid/MediXan recipients. Certain unavailable information may have a significant impact upon the permissibility of the proposed bid program: details concerning geographic market; the relevant market share and market power; the intentions of the participating states or other entities; the exact nature of the interstate cooperation agreement; each participating state's enabling legislation; and the length of time the bid and the interstate agreement will be in effect. As we do not have specific information concerning these and other possible fact issues, this opinion is general in nature and is limited to a discussion of antitrust principles as they apply to the facts currently before us. It is hoped that the discussion contained herein will provide guidance and allow.-SRS to conduct -the bid program procedure in accordance-4ith and mindful of antitrust principles. You state that the details and terms of a multi-state program have not been established. Because many states are interested in participating and because the successful bid winner's brand could become the only brand that states will reimburse Medicaid recipients for, the successful bid winner could significantly increase or assure itself of a large market for each drug. The geographic market, market share and relevant market for each successful bidder cannot be ascertained at this point. Nevertheless, it is obvious that should a significant number of.states participate nonsuccessful bidders could potentialLy lose or be precluded from obtaining a significant amount of business. Nonsuccessful bidders would be. able to sell their product to pharmacies wishing to stock their brands-and pharmacists remain able to sell any brand of drug to the general public or to state and federal aid recipients, but any Medicaid recipient wishing to have the state pay drug costs will have to purchase the-approved brand. Thus, pharmacists have a strong incentive to stock adequate-quantities of that brand and Medicaid recipients are extremely likely to request that brand. The general purpose of antitrust laws is the subject of much discussion between legal authority and economists. Broadly and generally stated, antitrust laws seek to promote, encourage and maintain competition and to prevent harmful59 Winu.;Loti Barton Page 4 monopolies. See generally City of Chanute, Kansas v.Williams Natural Gas Company, 678 F.Supp. s 1 (1971); C.J.S. MonopoliesS 15 (1948). The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. SS 1-7, forbids monopolizing tradein broad and general terms. Violation requires the possessionof monopoly power in a relevant market and the knowingintentional acquisition of that power by two or moreconspirators. McKenzie v. Mercy Hospital of Independence,Kansas, 854 F.2d 365, 367 (10th Cir. 1988). The ClaytonAct, 15 U.S.C. SS 12-27, prohibits specific anticompetitivebehavior outside the broad scope of the Sherman Act. Seegenerally 54 Am.Jur.2d Monopolies s 111 (1971). TheClayton Act seeks to promote competition through protectionof viable, small and locally owned businesses.- Ford MotorComDanv v. United States, 405 U.S. 562, 92 S.Ct. 1142, 31L.Ed.2d 492 (1972). The Robinson-Patman Act was enacted tostrengthen sections of the Clayton Act and seeks to protectsmall businesses unable to purchase in quantity. See FTCv. Morton Salt, 334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196|(1948). State antitrust laws vary in scope and applicationand each participating state must examine its own antitrustlaws. In order to determine whether a particular action violatesantitrust laws it becomes necessary to characterize thequestioned or challenged activity. Antitrust principles lookat two types-of anticompetitive relationships, horizontaland vertical. Horizontal restraints are arrangements betweenentities operating on the same level; manufacturers, suppliersor buyers. The proposed interstate drug bidding arrangementcould be characterized as a horizontal arrangement between twoentities operating on the same level, i.e. states as buyersor insurers. Practices that may result 1i a prohibitedhorizontal restraint include price fixing, boycotts of aproduct, manufacturer or customer, and mergers See Vakerics 'Antitrust Basics', pp. 6-1through 6-4\u00a7T1988). Vertical restraints conditions orrestrictions agreed to, imposed or directed at entitiesoperating at different levels. Vertical relationships whichmay exist in the proposed drug bidding program include therelationship between the states and the drug manufacturers,the states and the provider-pharmacists, the states and thegeneral public, and the states and the benefit recipients.Vertical restraints include dictating resale prices, Arizonav. Maricopa County Medical Societv, 457 U.S. 332, 102 S.Ct. 2466, 73 L.Ed.2d 48 (1982), or non-price restraints such ask 60 Win:;ii1 )11 flrt on i'age 5 territorial or customer restrictions, price discrimination. exclusive dealing or requirement contracts, and tie-ins. Antitrust restraints that may be implicated by the proposed bid program include price fixing, boycott, price discrimination, and requirement contract considerations. Price fixing restraints are traditionally considered per se illegal, while non-price restraints are more often subject to the rule of reason. Courts currently evidence a reluctance to impose a per se rule unless there is clear evidence of intent to monopolize or otherwise hinder helpful competition. Rather, courts now frequently -use a rule of reason-analysis to determine antitrust violations. Under the -rule-'of treason' the legality of restraints on trade is determined by weighing all the factors in-a case, such as the history of the restraint, the evil-believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy and the purpose or ends thought-to be attained. Blacks Law Dictionary 1196-(5th ed. 1979). Generally,\\ price fixing is any combination formed for the purpose and effect of raising, depressing, pegging, or stabilizing the price-of a commodity. United States v. Soconv Vacuum Oil CompanY, 310 U.S. 150, 223, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940). Sharing information on prices may also result in improper price fixing. See United States v. Container Corporation of America, 393 U.S. 333, 89 S.Ct. 510, .21 L.Ed.2d S526(1969) .However, where-third parties are-not affected by the price fixing scheme, a rule of reason will usually be applied. Medical Arts Pharmacy v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 675 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1982). See generally Hjelmfelt, \"Antitrust and Regulated Industries\", pp. 42-45 (1985) The proposed bid program does not appear to be a vertical or horizontal price fixing scheme. The states are a large buyer or buyers seeking the lowest price on a commodity. If the states were considered competitors there could be a possible horizontal price fixing charge against them.- However, the proposed drug bid program does not dictaterand will not automatically affect the price charged Aoaand paid by participating provider-pharmacists to the drug manufacturer. Moreover, the resale price to the general public or benefit recimients is not dictated by the drug bidding program. The bid reflects the price at which each manufacturer independently agrees to ultimately provide the drugs to the state or states. The states ask that each manufacturer fix its own individual price, and the states remain free to either accept or reject each bid. Thus, the price is fixed by the61 Winston Barton Page 6 manufacturer not by the states, and it is therefore unlikelythat a price fixing claim would succeed. Another possible antitrust principle that may be involvedconcerns boycotts. A boycott is \"a method of pressuring aparty ...by withholding or enlisting others to withholdpatronage or services.' St. Paul Fire and Marine InsuranceCompany v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 541, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 57L.Ed.2d 932 (1978). A boycott may be illegal if itimpermissibly increases market strength through concertedefforts. The Fifth Circuit held that a per se rule would be appliedto boycotts only when there was evidence of ananticompetitive motive, a commercial purpose rather anindustry self-regulation, and coercive economic pressure.St. Bernard General Hospital v. Hospital ServiceAssociation, 712 F.2d 978 (5th Cir. 1983). When there isno evidence of exclusionary anticompetitive purpose, intentor conduct, a rule of reason generally applies. AmericanMedical Association v. United States, 130'F.2d 233 (D.C.Cir. 1942), affd. 317 U.S. 519, 63 S.Ct. 326, 89 L.Ed.434 (1943). In the proposed drug bid program there is no obvious evidencethat the states or the provider-pharmacists are gettingtogether and refusing to deal with certain drug manufacturersfor an anticompetitive purpose. The articulated reason forencouraging use of the successful bidder's brand by the'statesis to keep costs paid for these drugs at a minimum. Theintent to contain costs is not a refusal to deal but rather anintent to obtain the most competitive price and thus topromote and encourage competition among suppliers. Using the rule of reason analysis, cost containment representsa valid competitive purpose. Reasonable contract terms andfree and open access to the bidding process will lessen thepossibility of a successful boycott claim against the states.However, the fact that only one manufacturer will be approvedfor each drag, even if more than one drug manufacturer submitsthe same low bid, undermines this cost containment argumentand purpose. Rather, the purpose of accepting only onemanufacturer appears to be either administrative ease or aneffort to increase the bargaining power of the states. Westrongly suggest that price containment purposes remain therationale and primary focus of the drug bidding program. Eachand every manufacturer of a required drug should be given anequal opportunity and be encouraged to compete for this 31-352 0 -90 -362 bm1!t nWarton Page 7 business. No intent to exercise exclusionary anticompetitive pressure should be evidenced or contemplated by participating states. If the states are satisfied that the bid price of more than one brand is the lowest price they can expect or get, it may be advisable to award the business to more than one manufacturer. The proposed drug bid program also resembles a requirement contract, which is defined as '[a contract in which] one agrees to buy, for sufficient consideration, all the merchandise of a designated type which the buyer may require for use ...one in which a party agrees to supply a specific good which another party may need during a certain period for an agreed price. Blacks Law Dictionary 1172 (5th ed. 1979). In the proposed bid program, the state agrees to ultimately pay the price of any drug used by a benefit recipient if that recipient uses the brand of a successful bidder. Thus, the insurer-state agrees to purchase all drugs of a particular type that it requires from one manufacturer. Requirement contracts are examples of non-price vertical restraints. The risk of antitrust problems increase in relation to the relative market power created by a requirements contract. Vakerics, 'Antitrust Principles\" 5 7.1 (1988). A requirement contract may violate antitrust law if an arrangement substantially lessens interbrand competition and competitors are seriously hindered or foreclosed from an available market for a significant period of time. See TamDa Electric Company v. Nashville Coal Company, 365 U.S. 320, 81 S.Ct. 623, 5 L.Ed.2d 580 (1961); Standard Oil Company of California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 69 S.Ct. 1051, 93 L.Ed. 1371 (1949). Several federal courts have examined the concept of exclusive dealing or requirement contracts in the health care field. These cases evidence a willingness to permit these arrangements if competition is not substantially lessened or a relevant market monopolized. See DosSantos v. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Center, 684 F.2d 1346 (7th Cir. 1982); White and White, Inc. v. American Hospital Supply Corp., 540 F.Supp. 951 (Mich. 1982), rev'd on other grnds, 723 F.2d 495 (6th Cir. 1983). In Medical Arts Pharmacy of Stanford, Inc. v. Blue Cross 6 Blue Shield of Coon., Inc., 518 F.Supp. 1100 (D. Conn. 1981), aff'd Per curiam, 675 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1982) the district court found that the defendant insurer was the purchaser even though the insureds actually used and obtained the drug. The second circuit court seems to imply that if63 Ei l:lI on i]Iarton ?a9c 8 market share is large enough there may be sufficient monopsonypower exercised by one large buyer to sustain a competitiveseller's claim that a pharmaceutical purchasing agreementobtained without collusion could be anticompetitive and aviolation of the Sherman Act. See also Sutliff, Inc.v. Donovan Cos., 727 F.2d 648, 655 (7th Cir. 1984);Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 547(5th Cir. 1980); Qualit( Auto Body, Inc. v. Co., 660 F.2d 1195 (7th Cir. 1981) cart. den.455 U.S. 1020 (1982). (Monopsony; \"a condition of the marketin which there is but one buyer for a particular commodity.\"Blacks Law Dictionary 908 (5th ed. 1979).) Most joint buying arrangements have potential efficiencieswhich remove them from per se violation of antitrust laws.Under the rule of reason, agreements or combinations may beprohibited if they prejudice the public interest by undulyrestricting competition or obstructing the course of trade.Reazin v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., 635F.Supp. 1287 (Kan. 1986). In a 1987 paper presented to theNational Health Lawvers Association Conference on AntitrustLaw in the Health Care Field, Michael L. Denger stated thatthe Federal Trade Commission considers government insuranceprograms to be purchasers of health care services, thus makingsuch programs part of a relevant market. However, Mr.Denger noted that membership in a prepaid prescription drugorganization making up less than 30 percent of the retailpharmaceutical sales in a geographic market will probably notbe challenged by the Justice Department. Other authoritiesbelieve obtaining more than 17 to 20 percent of a relevant orgeographic market will result in an antitrust law violation.It therefore becomes necessary to determine the geographicmarket for each drug and of each manufacturer in the bidprogram and what percentage of the relevant market will begiven to the winning manufacturer as a result of the proposedbid program. This requires detailed factual information.concerning the amount of a particular type of drug soldnationally, and in each participating state or area, and whatpercentage of those sales could, pursuant to this bid program,be given exclusively to the winning manufacturer. When themarket share does not confer market power, anticompetitiveclaims become less plausible. However, antitrust laws mayprohibit the proposed bid program if it allows onemanufacturer to obtain an unusually large share of a relevant-market, thus essentially reducing or precluding all helpfulcompetition. The length of time that the agreement will allowthe winning manufacturer to obtain this market share will alsobe relevant.64 Wil!:t 'ii Barton 9':\"\" ' Unless a substantial share of a relevant market is foreclosed for a significant period of time, or unless there is an anticompetitive purpose or intent, an exclusive dealing or requirements contract will generally not present antitrust problems under a rule of reason analysis. Vakerics at S 7.09. We therefore suggest that any agreement entered into between the states or between an individual state and a pharmaceutical manufacturer be for a limited time period and initially allow every manufacturer equal access to this particular market. Once the proposed bid program and the degree of state participation is determined, an analysis of the pertinent market data can be made. It is our opinion that, under the rule of reason, unless there is an anticompetitive intent or a large percentage of the entire market for each particular drug will be foreclosed to other manufacturers for a significant period of time, the proposed drug bid program does not represent impermissible large scale buying or a prohibited requirement contract. 15 U.S.C. S 13(a) discusses price discrimination. Most recent price discrimination cases do not involve governmental prosecution, but rather, are brought by parties allegedly harmed by the behavior. Illegal price discrimination may be alleged by nonparticipating states, pharmaceutical companies who lose business, or members of the public or provider-pharmacists who do not receive the same price. Without specific information we cannot discuss the merits or standing of such challenges. Generally, any unwarranted price favoritism shown by suppliers to larger purchases not based on permissible justifications or defenses may be a violation of antitrust laws. See Gianelli Distributing Company v. Beck and Company, 172 Cal.App.3rd 120, 19 Cal. Rptr. 230 (1985); Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association Inc. v. Abbbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150, 103 S.Ct. 1011, 74 L.Ed.2d 882 (1983); Portland Retail Drug Association v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, 662 F.2d 641 (9th Cir. 1981). The price paid by the pharmacist and the patient-purchaser for each particular drug is not necessarily altered by the drug bid program. Rather, the drug bid program establishes the ultimate price that the state insurer will pay for the drug. The same drug (with the same shipping, manufacturing and other associated costs) will ultimately be made available to the state at a potentially different and lower price than the price paid by others. The provider-pharmacist will not necessarily be charged less for the drugs used by65 WinLLun Barton Page 10 Medicaid/MediKan recipients. Ultimately, however, others may pay more for the same drug. 15 U.S.C. S 13b permits rebates from a cooperative association to its members, producers, or consumers, but rebates may not be used to violate price discrimination laws. See Bargain Car Wash, Inc. v. Standard Oil Company, 466 F.2d 1163 (7th Cir. 1972). The fact that the states are paying a potentially lower price for the same drugs may not represent price discrimination if a valid defense can be claimed. The defendant (often the supplier) in an antitrust case can rebut a claim of illegal price discrimination by showing that there are lower costs in serving this particular purchaser, changing conditions allow a change in price, or competition is met and justifies the lower price. See Hansen, \"Robinson-Patman Law\", LI Fordham L. Rev. 113 (1983). Prices set or obtained by governmental entities may not represent price discrimination if the activity is of a governmental nature. Generally, the Robinson-Patman Act does aomtapply to sales made to the government. See Gaslight3Company of Columbus v. Georgia Power Company, 313 F.Su-op. !B860, 440 F.2d 1135, cert. den., 404 U.S. 1062, 92 S.Ct.-732, 30 L.Ed.2d 750 reh. den., 405 U.S. 969, 92 S.Ct. 1162, 31 L.Ed.2d 244 (1970). However, governmental immunity is not extended to every act or every price set by a governmental entity. See Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150, 103 S.Ct. 1011, 74 L.Ed.2d 882 (1983). Immunity from antitrust laws exists for a governmental entity if (1) the challenged restraint is one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed by state policy and (2) the policy itself is actively supervised by the state. See Russell v. City of -Kansas City, Kansas, 690 F.Supp. 947 (Kan. 1988). .Is-ng the -anas1lsi-s articulated in Russell, SRS and other state agenciesimay be able to make a legitimate argument that involvement in drug bidding programs is immune from antitrust laws. Most social welfare agencies are given authority to administer the state's medical programs and thus the argument can be made that the legislature's authorization of that administration either contemplated the resulting anticompetitive effects or such activities were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the authorization. However, those challenging this activity may argue that the legislature allows SRS (and other equivalent agencies) to provide medical-care, not to set prices in violation of antitrust laws. Jefferson County, 460 U.S. 150, 103 S.Ct. 1011, 7466 L.Ed.2d 882 (1983), involved the sale of pharmaceutical products to state and local government hospitals in competition with private pharmacies. The Court, in a five to four decision, held that these actions were not exempt from the Robinson-Patman Act. However, the opinion noted that \"we are not concerned with ...state purchases for use in traditional governmental functions ...[nevertheless] we conclude that the exemption does not apply where a state has chosen to compete in the private retail market.' Id. at 153-154. In footnote seven the court acknowledged that it was not addressing whether sales by the state to indigents were in competition with private enterprises. Thus, this remains an unresolved issue. Kansas legislators have given SRS broad authority in the area of medical care benefits for qualified persons. This delegation has allowed SRS much regulatory and discretionary authority concerning implementation of the benefits program. If SRS authorities exercise this delegated authority by participating in the drug bid program and the legislature does not act to limit this authority, it is our opinion that, even if an antitrust law would otherwise be violated, governmental immunity may allow SRS to take part in this program. Agencies from other states who wish to participate in the proposed drug bid program must individually examine whether their state's policies and enabling acts authorize participating in such a program and whether the state actively supervises its implementation. In conclusion, although the proposed bid program raises serious antitrust questions, we believe it does not represent a per se violation of antitrust laws. Under a rule of reason analysis, the proposed drug bid program may survive an antitrust challenge. The drug bid program should be conducted so as to provide that (1) each manufacturer is given an equal and meaningful opportunity to compete for this business, with no voice in determining which manufacturer is selected, (2) the participant states should not be competing purchasers who conspire to fix a buying price, (3) objective bidding criteria should be maintained, (4) each participant pharmacist, benefit recipient and purchaser should remain free to select any and all pharmaceutical providers with which they wish to contract, (5) the winning manufacturer should not be allowed to possess a market power that unreasonably excludes or eliminates all competition, and (6) the terms of the agreement should be for a reasonable and limited time period. If, under the rule of reason analysis, a potential antitrust violation remains a - possibility, governmental immunity may nevertheless allow the activity if: (1) each participating state agency has authority to enter into such an arrangement; (2) the state actively supervises the program; and (3) the anticompetitive results are expected or foreseeable. Specific legislative enactment allowing each aspect of the program could effectively negate most claims that the participating states violated antitrust laws.

This is similar to the \"chargeback\" contractual systems used REMAThE.. s,,. between manufacturers, wholesalers, and buying groups. On the negative side of the Kansas Medicaid Bid Program foriC~ak., pharmaceuticals, there are three major points to consider. One is the administrative time required. Another is the provider educationc.., r.W.. necessary. The third, and most time-consucing, is dealing with thec _nnenenane opposition from manufacturers. ,,5,N Administration of any program does take time and money. Programsrequire education and \"fire fighting\". Individuals and companies68 Page Two that do not understand the program, or who feel it goes against their self-interest, will fight and mount their own educational program in opposition. This can greatly increase the administrative time required for the program. Any innovative program will have opposition. While, as stated above, our bid and adjustment program is similar to many other bid or chargeback programs, this concept has apparently never been implemented by a Medicaid Program. Many pharmaceutical companies are afraid it will work and they will have to compete in a different manner, or lose a sizable share of their sales. Included for your information is a \"handout\" and presentation outline I used at the Region VII HCFA Program on Pharmacy Coverage Reimbursement last July. One point to remember is that the Kansas program is \"NDC Specific\"; that is, the pharmacist must submit a claim for the product, by National Drug Code (NDC) number taken from the exact package dispensed, and this code must appear on the Kansas Medicaid/MediKan Drug List.

Procedure: To request bids from pharmaceutical companies that will reduce the final cost to the State of drugs dispensed to Medicaid/MediKan recipients, while increasing sales volume for the bid winner. Scope: Bids have been requested and received for both generic equivalent drugs and for therapeutic alternatives. Note: We are not requiring or suggesting therapeutic substitution by the R.Ph. is necessary for this program. csl 07/19/8871 ATTACHMENT (4) STATE OF KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION D-vlsion of Purchases MIKE HAYDEN. am sI,.- o-.: 8 -; NICHOLAS B Contract No. 27601 Date Mailed: March 14, 1988 Closing Date, 2:00 p.m., April 4, 1988 Contracting Officer: Eileen Shae:, PPS Telephone: (913) 20t-3124 NOTICE TO BIDDERS Invitations are hereby extended for bids on the attached proposed contract.

This is \"net/net.\" Inventory cost after all buying group and individual discounts, early payment discounts, free goods, credits, premiums, and chargebacks are deducted. It is very difficult to obtain an accurate AAC and to be useful, it has to be an average. As an average, AAC could be referred to as Estimated Actual Acquisition Cost, or (EAAC). Estimated Acquisition Cost (EAC) frequently has a different' definition however. Refer to listed definition of EAC. The recently completed study, done for Kansas Medicaid by Myers and Stauffer, is probably the best estimate of EAAC done in recent years. In 1988, under a contract with Kansas SRS, Myers and Stauffer started a study to define the actual acquisition cost of the 300 highest volume and highest total-cost drugs by National Drug Code (NDC). A total of 400 drug packages were studied. The study was completed in early 1989, but left some questions still unanswered, so several new investigative regressions were performed. The resulting-data is currently contained in numerical and regression analysis chart format. Darrell Stauffer is currently drafting a narrative article to explain the analysis. AAWP -Average of AWPs. There are three pricing update services for pharmaceuticals: Blue Book, Red Book and MediSpan. Each uses different sources to average the wholesale prices. The AAWP is an average of the averages. Although not frequently used as a reference, it is probably a more accurate catalogue price list of wholesale cost averages. AWP -Average Wholesale Price. This term in years past meant what retail pharmacists paid to their wholesalers. Their net cost was no more than 2% below AWP for the average independent pharmacy in the post-World War II years. The chain stores reputedly received more than 2% cash discount. Generally, however, their cost savings were due to Direct Purchasing, where thay could save the 16 2/3% wholesale markup. The chains did their own warehousing after purchasing huge quantities direct from the manufacturers. In the last 20 years, wholesalers have become very competitive, giving large discounts to their better customers initially, and now to almost all customers. Wholesalers have increased their volume of sales, from two primary sources (aside from eliminating their competition). (1) The wholesalers have made it financially practical for both independents and chains to reduce or discontinue direct purchasing and use a \"Prime Vendor\" concept. (2) They are servicing the retail \"buying group cooperatives\" that have developed in the past five years. The AWP concept has remained, but discounts have lowered the net acquisition cost well below AWlP.99- Qossary Page 2 HCFA recently completed a successful suit against Louisiana Medicaid for itsreimbursement policy of using an \"unmodified\" AWP as Estimated Acquisition Cost(EAC). It is unknown whether HCFA will pursue the policy of requiring adiscounted AWP for Medicaid since AWP is the pricing base stated for theMedicare Catastrophic Prescription Drug coverage when it goes intoimplementation. This dichotomy in HCFA policy (between Medicaid and Medicare)has not been explained, and it is unknown whether it will continue. AWP Minus. Recognizing the myth of AWP, some third party programs now use the published AWPas a baseline, and subtract a percentage, using varying formulas. DESI -Drug Efficacy Study Implementation. A federal study of the 1970's in which drugs were rated as effective, probablyeffective, possibly effective, or not effective. After final implementation,many drugs rated \"less than effective\" were forced off the market although manyare still marketed. After October 30, 1981, the federal match was disallowedfor any such drugs, and Kansas Medicaid removed them from the Drug List onNovember 30, 1981. New drugs have been added to the list sporadically sincethen. DP -Direct Pricing. Products are purchased direct from the manufacturer, at a cost savings overpurchasing from a wholesaler. This term means the same as in the past, with thesame 1 or 2% cash discount available for prompt payment. A great manypharmacies, both independent and chain, now utilize a prime vendor wholesalerrather than buying direct, and have reduced their overall costs to a level veryclose to DP. We still reimburse at DP for eight companies' products. Drug Entity. A drug, or specified combination of drugs packaged as a mixture; and defined bythe generic name/names. A drug entity may be a sole source or brand nameproduct, or it may be a multisource or generic product. EAC -Estimated Acquisition Cost. A figure that is defined by different sources as AWP, AWP minus, DP catalogueprice, WAC plus, AAC, or a combination of these. We define it as MediSpan'slisted DP for eight companies' products, and MediSpan's listed AWP for otherdrugs. (For FUL and SMAC drugs we reimburse the lower of the EAC or theFUL/SMAC price.).100 Glossary Page 3 FUL -Federal Upper Limits. Also shown in some pricing references as HCFA FFP. (1) A list of multisource drugs, specified by HCFA, for which we cannot reimburse more, in aggregate, than the cost would be if reimbursed at the FUL listed price. (2) A less well-defined list of other drugs (essentially all others), either multisource not on the first list, or sole-source drugs, for which payment should not exceed acquisition cost. The FUL system replaced the old federal MAC (Maximum Allowable Cost) and became effective in October, 1987. The second complete list of multisource FUL drugs became effective on July 1, 1988. The third new list was implemented June 1, 1989. Each successive new list, while using the same formula to arrive at the FUL price, has shown dramatic decreases on allowable reimbursement of some of the listed drugs. Each new list has also included new entities. Each new list has allowed an unrealistically short lead time to implement and notify providers. NDC -National Drug Code. The assigned eleven-digit number that defines the manufacturer/repackager (five digits), the drug entity (four digits), and the specific package (two digits). SMAC -State Maximum Allowable Cost. The \"ceiling\" price the Kansas Medicaid Program will reimburse for a drug entity. U&C -Usual & Customary Cost. The price which the pharmacy normally charges to non-Medicaid prescription clients. WAC -Wholesaler Acquisition Cost. Some wholesalers have scrapped AWP, and list their acquisition cost, to which they add a variable markup. Their catalogues show their cost, not their selling price to the pharmacist, which leaves questions when used as a reference point. WAC Plus. The WAC plus a percentage, as specified by some third party payors. EES: csl 06/28/89101 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Barton.Mr. Mincy, partner of the Lenco Group. Mr. Mincy isgoing to tell us about how retail pharmacists and buying groupshave fared in securing discounts from the drug manufacturers.Mr. Mincy. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM MINCY, PARTNER, THE LENCO GROUP, TALLAHASSEE, FL Mr. MINCY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and distinguished mem-bers of the committee. My name is William Mincy. I'm a partner ofthe Lenco Group. Thank you for the opportunity to appear heretoday to address the issue of prescription drug prices.During the past 5 years I've been involved in the developmentand operation of retail pharmacy group purchasing programs serv-ing the -needs of some 2,300 independent pharmacies throughoutthe Nation. Allow me to begin by discussing the reasons why retail pharma-cies have consolidated their purchases in order to negotiate com-petitive prices. Retail pharmacies, especially the smaller independ-ently owned pharmacies, have found themselves faced with situa-tions where they cannot. and could not compete on equal footingwith their competitors on* the acquisition 'of pharmaceutical prod-ucts. Reasons for this situation include the fact that-certain entitiesenjoy special pharmaceutical purchasing considerations because oftheir class of trade, profit, or not-for-profit status, orisheer: size. Ad-ditionally, increased emphasis on cost containment by the Medicaidprograms, the insurance industry, and the business communityhave provided incentives for retail pharmacies to seek methods topurchase pharmaceutical products at the best available prices orface economic ruin. In fact, individual retailers are paying the pre-mium price so that these other entities can realize special pre-ferred prices. In short, group purchasing programs- were developedas a survival mechanism by the retail pharmacies themselves sothat they can effectively compete and remain profitable.It is estimated that more than 15,000 retail pharmacies currentlyparticipate in group purchasing programs throughout the Nationin an attempt to negotiate competitive prices from pharmaceuticalmanufacturers. The framework of the retail pharmacy group pur-chasing programs may vary from group to group-or State to State.However, the fundamental concept of consolidating purchases andcommitting purchases in return for better.prices remains the cor-nerstone of the movement. In general, group purchasing program member pharmacies pur-chase certain negotiated products from specific drug wholesalers atspecial contract prices negotiated between the group's negotiatorand participating pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers.These specific drug wholesalers, or-what we call prime vendors,contract with group purchasing programs to purchase, warehouse,and distribute the products at these special contract prices. Theprime vendor wholesaler purchases the products at the normal pur-chase price. Purchases between member pharmacies and wholesal-ers and between the wholesalers and the pharmaceutical manufac-102 turers are tracked on specialized reports to safeguard against prod- uct diversion. Another set of special reports, called chargeback reports, are gen- erated by the wholesalers back to the manufacturers so that credit is given to the wholesaler for products sold to member pharmacies at the negotiated contract prices. The benefits that member pharmacies realize from group pur- chasing programs include several things: No. 1, reduced product ac- quisition costs; No. 2, reduced total inventory investment; No. 3, in- creased inventory turnover and control; and No. 4, reduced product ordering and inventory management expenses. To date, group pur- chasing programs have provided these benefits to their respective member pharmacies in the extremely competitive, multisource or generic drug product market. Participating manufacturers offer contract prices to the group purchasing programs in return for in- creased market share and for promotional purposes. Pharmaceutical manufacturers of single-source and brand name multi-source drug products have, for the most part, declined to par- ticipate with the group purchasing programs. Their reasons for nonparticipation include a perceived lack of commitment or buying discipline by the member pharmacies; number two, the class of trade that retail pharmacy is classified as; and number three, re- duced profits. These reasons are quite confusing to member phar- macies and to the group purchasing program administrators in light that the majority of these same pharmaceutical manufactur- ers participate in contract purchasing programs with hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and mail order pharmacy com- panies that often compete directly with the retail pharmacies. A complete change in the manner drug products are sold and market- ed will occur if pharmaceutical manufacturers decide to participate fully in group purchasing programs, benefiting consumers, retail pharmacies, and the pharmaceutical industry. In summary, group purchasing programs have successfully pro- vided the vehicle for retail pharmacies to compete effectively in today's health care marketplace. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have likewise benefited from increased sales and gains in market share as a result of their participation. The continued viability of group purchasing programs will be linked to their ability to impact product sales and market share and improve member pharmacy's buying commitment. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee today. I'm prepared to answer any questions that you have. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Mincy, thank you. I'm going to invoke the 3 minute rule on questions. I'll invoke the same rule myself. I will start out with a couple of questions for Mr: Barton. In Kansas, in this very innovative program that you have, why do you think that the brand name drug manufacturers don't like the program, or conceivably even refuse to participate? Mr. BARTON. Well, Mr. Chairman, the key reason I mentioned in my talk is the possible loss of profit. Right now, the way the Medic- aid Program works, not only in Kansas but in all States, the State pays whatever the manufacturer charges the pharmacist. If his retail price is $50 for this drug a so-called \"H2Antagonist\", the103 State pays it. They have nothing to gain unless they win the bid,but they're afraid of losing money. That's the key reason.The CHAIRMAN. Would the consumer in Kansas save a great dealof money if the drug manufacturers would -competitively bid or par-ticipate in this-program? Mr. BARTON. Oh, absolutely, especially in Medicaid, and if Medi-care joins the program there will be a significant savings. The tax-payers of the State will be the big savers, and. ultimately those areour citizens. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Barton, what has happened in the KansasGeneral Assembly on the State legislative level.with regard to theprogram? Are there any obstacles there, or does the Kansas legisla-ture support this concept? What is the status today?Mr. BARTON. Well, Mr. Chairman, there's been -a tremendousnumber of lobbyists in this State; also in your home State of Ar-kansas. There was a bill introduced into our legislature that wasgoing to prohibit us from having basically a restricted formulary.The bill said that we could not restrict our formulary which had afiscal note in Kansas of $20 million. Our total program is $27 mil-lion. A proviso was put in our appropriation bill that prohibited usfrom bidding drugs in Kansas. That was later removed before itfinished the legislative process. So there's this tremendously stronglobby, not -only in Kansas but in -other States, .to prohibit StateMedicaid agencies from even trying a program such as this.The CHAIRMAN. All right. Mr. Mincy, let me shift to you if I might, just a moment, and my3 minutes are about up. What.has been the response. of-the drugmanufacturers in dealing with these combinations; 4etis say, orthese groups who want to purchase drugs less expensively? What's-been the response of the manufacturers?Mr. MINCY. The generic manufacturers have been extremely sup-portive of us, and have, seen us as a viable method of them gainingmarket share. The brand name manufacturers have, for the mostpart, declined to participate because of either the class of tradeissue that I've mentioned before, or they are afraid of the loss ofprofits that we -would cause by providing these services, to the re-tailers who constitute the majority of their purchasers.The CHAIRMAN. All right.I.don't know if we have a chart on this, but I have a chart andI'm going to get some copies -for the committee, showing what thepharmacist since 1982, at the local- corner drugstore, is gettingfrom Medicaid reimbursement to 'dispose prescriptions from behindthe counter.4In 1982 he or she -was getting $3.04. Today they'regetting $3.32 for the same amount of time and the same work.Where the price of the drug itself in 1982 was $6.13, that samedrug today is $11.07. Now, what's going on here? The pharmacist is pretty well in asqueeze. The drug companies keep going up in their prices. Why allthese price increases? Mr. MINCY. Mr. Chairman, that's exactly the situation the phar-macists today find themselves in. We have 'to go out and talk to the 4 See appendix 1, p. 339 for charts.104 consumer daily. We look quizzically at 11, 12, 18 percent price in- creases every year. And it is unfortunate that the consumer has to confront the pharmacist, and the pharmacist has to confront their wholesalers and manufacturers. We have no recourse but to pass those increases onto the consumer. That's the reason for us band- ing together. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Mincy, my time is up. I may want to come back to a line of questions here. I believe Senator Grassley is next on the list. I'm using the early bird rule. Some of our birds have left, but anyway, we'll go to Sena- tor Grassley. Senator GRASSLEY. Dennis, you described the volume discount that the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, are able to obtain from drug manufacturers, and you noted that the Veterans' Administration can get larger discounts when there's competition between companies marketing versions of the same pharmaceutical. Are there differences among the single source drugs in the size of the discount that the VA is able to get, and are you able to say what factors determine the size of the discount you get? And just as a for instance, are you able to obtain such discounts on pharma- ceuticals that have just been approved-by just approved I mean just a few weeks or months ago, for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration? Mr. STYRsKY. That's a multianswer type question. It depends largely on the manufacturers themselves and their attitudes toward the Federal marketplace. I'm answering in reverse order. New drugs that enter the marketplace-there are manufacturers who are very receptive to introducing those drugs immediately to our Federal supply schedule program, or even our depot program. There are also manufacturers who choose not to enter those drugs into any form of fixed price, whether it's a Government market or otherwise, and much like every other consumer, we are out there in the marketplace fighting for a best price on a local hospital-by- hospital basis. Volume discounts range again, and that's becoming more stand- ard practice, the discounts. Senator GRASSLEY. You say it varies from company to company, and that's perfectly legitimate, because they are in a position to make the decision of who they want to do business with, and under what circumstances as far as bids are concerned. Could you specu- late why some companies might, and others might not? Mr. STYRSKY. It's easier to speculate-- Senator GRASSLEY. With a drug just off of the FDA approval list? Mr. STYRSKY. It's largely, I think, due to the population, and does the drug fit the population. Will it have an effect on the training? And of course, Veterans Hospitals are a vast training ground for the future physicians in America: So they do like to see their prod- uct introduced there. Senator GRASSLEY. Would there be any factor like some compa- nies having a policy not to do this because they want to recoup the cost of research, where other companies might not be inclined to recoup that cost in a hurry? Mr. STYRSKY. It could be their policy.105 Senator GRAssLEY. But you don't really know?Mr. STYRSKY. -No. What we would hear is that they don't want tofill out a Government solicitation.Senator GRAssLEY. And you don't feel you-know enough about itto speculate on that point? Mr. STYRSKY. That's correct.Senator GRASSLEY. OK. Are there any other differences that you might think of, factorsthat determine the size of discount you get?Mr. STYRSKY. Basically our ability to analyze the marketplaceand our relative position in that marketplace. That's been a bighelp to us. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley, I hate to do this, but I'm goingto invoke the 3 minute rule on all of us. alike. And if you will stay,in a moment we'll come. back to you, if that's all right.Senator GRASSLEY. Yes, that's fine.The CHAIRMAN. All right.Senator Kohl. Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Mincy, why is it that the VA, the hospitals, other organiza-tions are able to get drugs at prices that are negotiated and cheap-e 3er than what the retail operation-I mean what is it, is there some--Ifl hing-in the nature of the system, something--Mr. MINCY. It's quizzical to me also, Senator. We have tried toprovide the mechanism, the framework of bidding, distribution, ofbuying commitments, the same way that profit -and not-for-profithospitals work, and that the VA works that we're familiar with,and HMOs work. And for. whatever reasons we're told that wedon't apply, that. we don't meet the criteria, or that it's against cor-porate policy at this time. to deal with a- retail pharmacy buyinggroupier the xetail pharmacies. Senotor KOHL. Is there some percentage as to how much of theproduftis sold at the retail- level versus these other levels? Do youhave an idea? Are-you the big source of sales- for them, and is thatwhy they don't want to do business with you?* Mr. MINCY. Yes, sir. I think if you look at the phamacy market,that the -chain of independent pharmacy markets.dill.zconstitutesthe majority of how -consumers receive- their medications -today.And certainly the pharmaceutical manufacturers receive the ma-jority of their -profits through -the sale through community andchain drugstores. Senator KOHL. Is it that.in the nature of the business they go outand create a brand- preference at. theu2mtail level, and that's howthey can afford not toidto business-with-you? Because they knowyou have to carry their product, and so they -can take the biggestprice from you, because as a result of their advertising-they createthat brand preference? Mr. MINcY. Most of the marketing activities by pharmaceutical--manufacturers are still directed toward the physician who writes-the prescription: And then the pharmacist -is responding to the pre-, scription order and will stock the products that the physicianswant for dispensing to the patients. So, we're responding to whatthe physician wants to-serve his patients.106 Senator KOHL. So do they then do it by getting the brand intro- duced at the level of the physician to the patient, and doing it as inducement, a price inducement, and then they're able to use that leverage at the retail level? Is this why it's happening? Mr. MINCY. There's not very much price inducement at the retail level, sir, from a pharmacist's standpoint. Senator KOHL. Right. I said use the inducement at the other levels, a price inducement at the other levels to create the brand introduction, and then they don't have to induce-they don't have to use the leverage at your level, because it's already been accomplished? Mr. MINcY. That's very possible, sir. Senator KOHL. Well, you must have some ideas. I mean, you think about it all day long, I'm sure. Mr. MINCY. My ideas, sir, are that the special prices that are given to HMOs and hospitals, and the Government and the VA and so forth, are being in effect carried by the retailers. We're paying the premium. Senator KOHL. Yes. Mr. MINCY. And I believe that there needs to be some investiga- tion into that. Senator KOHL. Do you agree, just quickly, Mr. Styrsky? Do you think he's somewhere close to analyzing the situation correctly? Mr. STYRSKY. I don't know. Maybe partially. Senator KOHL. Or do you think they're just doing a bad job, and you're doing a good job? Mr. STYRSKY. No. I think we're talking two different systems, be- cause we do deal in volume purchasing and storage on the part of the Government, and redistribution. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kohl, I hate to call time on you, but you can come back and ask other questions in just a moment. We're going to try to go by our rule. I think our next Senator is Senator Warner. Senator WARNER. I'm going to pass for a moment. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Warner is going to pass. I think, then, Senator Graham. Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barton, in your dealings with the pharmaceutical industry have you experienced any difference where you're dealing with a company that has a single source drug as opposed to those compa- nies which are providing one of a multiple source? Mr. BARTON. Yes. And I wanted to make a comment on that. The generic companies have not given us any problem at all. They're very receptive to our bid program in Kansas. But the single sources, basically they don't want to talk to us. One of the reasons they don't, Senator, is that we're not buying the drug directly. We're basically a rebate program. They use that as the reason that they're not interested; they will not participate because we're not warehousing it like the Veterans' Administration is. And that's one of the reasons they won't participate. But I don't know that I can tell any major difference other than resistance from the single source brands.107 Senator GRAHAM. 'One of the-charts in back of us here,5-the onethat shows different -countries, indicates a very-significant differen-tial in the international price comparison. Have you explored thepurchase of drugs from non-U.S. pharmaceutical firms where theirdrugs are authorized for use in the United States?Mr. BARTON. Not to any great degree.\"And it's interesting seeingthat chart, comparing the other chart that's up there, in that thepharmaceutical companies have had a tremendous increase, whileour local pharmacists has not.And the numbers there are true. In our Medicaid Program, wepay whatever the pharmacist is charged for the drug plus a dis-pensing fee. In Kansas, that fee has gone up maybe 5 or 10 percentin the last 5 years. But the charts indicate, drug costs have gone uptremendously. But the Medicaid program in Kansas, has not hadthe money to increase the rates to the pharmacists. We've had tohold his fee low, because we have to pay the cost of the drug.Senator GRAHAM. I think the point of this chart is that for in-stance onethe average in the European Economic Community, theweighted average of retail price per brand-I'm not certain whatthe 'base here is, but it was roughly one-third of what the sameweighted average was in the United States. Are there any prohibi-tions on your applying your program of bidding to non-U.S. manu-facturers of equivalent drugs which are authorized for use in theUnited States? Mr. BARTON. If they are FDA approved we can purchase thedrugs. We have not actively gone out and sought those, but if theyare FDA approved, yes, we can buy them.Senator GRAHAM. Are there any reasons why you have not ex-plored 'that? Mr. BARTON. No, I'm not aware of any, but it's something thatI'd be very interested in looking at.Senator GRAHAM. What about the Veterans Administration?Have you utilized non-U.S. pharmaceutical companies wherethey're providing equivalent U.S.-approved drugs?Mr. STYRSKY. Where they have been approved by the Food andDrug Administration, yes, we have, Senator.Senator GRAHAM. And what's been your experience in the use of non-U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers' products?The CHAIRMAN. Senator Graham, could he come back andanswer that question in one moment, if we abide by our 3-minuterule? I hate to cut you off.Senator Kassebaum is next.Senator KASSEBAUM. I'll be glad to give a minute of my time.The CHAIRMAN. All right.She's going to yield you for a minute, Senator Graham.Mr. STYRSKY. The foreign manufacturers that we've utilized,we've had no problems with the product in terms of acceptance oreffectiveness. Senator KASSEBAUM. Does the VA buy a large percentage of itsdrugs from foreign manufacturers?Mr. STYRSKY. Not a large percentage, no, Senator. See appendix 1, p. 344.108 Senator KASSEBAUM. Do you know about what it is? Mr. STYRSKY. Of foreign manufacture, I would say it's probably less than 1 percent. Senator GRAHAM. Have you been able to get about the same dis- count from foreign manufacturers that you have been able to from the United States, and what is the comparable absolute cost, that is, after discount of similar drugs, U.S.-produced versus non-U.S. produced? Mr. STYRSKY. The foreign manufacturers that we have dealt with have been in the competitive arena, so we're not really talking about a proprietary or a sole source drug. In being competitive, yes, they are very competitive. And in some cases, extremely competitive. Senator GRAHAM. Well, if they are very or extremely competi- tive, why do they only represent 1 percent of your purchases? Mr. STYRSKY. There aren't enough of them in the American market. Senator GRAHAM. There aren't enough foreign pharmaceutical firms that are-- Mr. STYRSKY. They may not be holding approved NDA's or ANDA's to market in this country. The CHAIRMAN. If we could come back to this line of questions from Senator Graham in a moment. Senator Kassebaum. Senator KASSEBAUM. Thank you. Mr. Barton, I would like to ask, it is clear why the pharmaceuti- cal companies have objections to the Kansas plan, but what re- sponse have you had from doctors? I would think there might be some objections from them as far as interference with their right to prescribe drugs of choice. Mr. BARTON. That's a very good question, Senator. We have had some resistance from the doctors, not as much as you might think, because one of the ways that we have tried to work with the doc- tors-we are not practicing medicine in the Medicaid agency, but if a doctor feels that a drug that's not on formulary is necessary for that client, we grant exceptions to the doctor. All he has to do is tell us why his patient should have one drug versus another, and then we will approve it. So, probably 95 percent of the doctors in Kansas are happy with the program. Senator KASSEBAUM. Some of those who don't like this program bring up the antitrust issue. I am aware that the Attorney General in Kansas has cautiously concluded that we are not in infringe- ment there. Nevertheless, do you have any comments regarding the possible anti-trust problems of expanding your bidding program into the much larger Medicare field? Would not there be a real danger of an antitrust worry as far as stifling competition? Mr. BARTON. There is some concern for some drugs, like the ulcer medicine that's used by the elderly. If we had a Medicare contract and we had a Medicaid contract that covered all States, we would probably have more than 30 percent of the market share of that drug, so there could possibly be that question. But I think that's a long way down the road. If we can get the program started, we'll worry about that later. But I don't think it's a major problem for the first 2 or 3 years.109 Senator KASSEBAUM. Thank you.The CHAIRMAN. By unanimous consent I am going to grant an-other minute to Mrs. Kassebaum, because you've been so generousin giving us of your time.Senator KASSEBAUM. Well, the next question is sort of for any-body who wants to answer on the panel. And it's a little bit longerone. It has to do with the Canadian system. And maybe I should savethis for the next panel. I don't know if any of you are familiar withthe system of granting royalties in lieu of a patent over a period oftime? I'll wait until the next panel.The CHAIRMAN. I do think, Senator Kassebaum, after the nextpanel there will be someone qualified to talk about the Canadiansystem. Senator KASSEBAUM. Well, I'll reserve my extra time for then.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kassebaum.Senator Simpson. Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.It's been very interesting to listen to the Kansas experimentthere. Senator Kassebaum had commented on that and talkedabout that. I have been deeply involved in VA activities. I used to chair thecommittee, and then was the ranking member. But I ask Mr.Styrsky, how much staff do you use? How long does it take to pre-pare for your negotiations? What's involved? Can you give me aquick one on that, please? Is it a big operation in the VA?Mr. STYRSKY. The Pharmaceutical Products Division consists of20 people total. Our responsibility encompasses approximately $750million in annual contracting. Preparing for negotiations is doneabout 180 days prior to the actual expiration date. And that startsin various phases; market research, past prices, current prices, andthen actually sitting down and negotiating.Senator SIMPSON. It must be an awesome process, how you deter-mine prices offered to most-favored customers, other seemingly pro-prietary information, use of a formulary. Who decides which prod-ucts deserve the favored spot?Mr. STYRSKY. Well, the physician is ultimately the one who de-cides the product to be used in VA. Our charge is to make it avail-able to him at the most economic price.Senator SIMPSON. Do the pharmaceutical people have pretty goodaccess to the physicians as they discuss those products?Mr. STYRSKY. I'm sure they do, yes.Senator SIMPSON. Do you think Medicare could achieve the samediscount rates, 41 percent for single source prescriptions, 67 per-cent for multiple source? Do you think they could get that?Mr. STYRSKY. I honestly don't know, Senator. That's a differentsystem and I don't feel qualified to answer.Senator SIMPSON. Is there any reason that manufacturers mightnot want to participate in similar negotiations with Medicare?Would they be less willing to divulge proprietary information toHCFA, or would the lure of a multibillion-dollar lock on a certainnational product be too enticing?Mr. STYRSKY. That, again, I don't think I'm qualified to answer.110 Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think these are things that we need to find out. And I'm going to mess around in it myself. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Senator Warner. Senator WARNER. Thank you. Mr. Mincy, the underlying tone, what we've heard thus far-and I'm not suggesting the witnesses have provided the testimony, but in preparation of all of our papers and this hearing-is that the drug companies are out there just lying in the bushes gouging the poor people. And I've talked to a7 number of the major manufactur- ers and I don't think that intentionally is true. But I cannot get a grip on why the normal market forces of competition are not driv- ing this market in the same directions, say, as television sets or automobiles or other commodities which we deal with. Is there a difference from other products in the competitive forces in this marketplace? Mr. MINCY. Senator, some of the differences are the products themselves. The research that goes into the development of a prod- uct says that a certain chemical entity will meet a certain disease state, or a desired outcome is going to come from that particular product. There may not be any other products that can provide that same one. Senator WARNER. So they've got a monopoly then? Mr. MINCY. To some effect. They were smart enough, they were industrious enough to go and develop a product that could meet that particular entity's need. And to that I've always applauded them, and will continue to. Where we have been successful, and where market pressures really show a result, is in the more competitive multiple source products, where in fact we go and show them what our buying volume can be for a period of time, we show them the method of distribution, we provide reporting mechanisms so that we can pro- tect against diversion. And many manufacturers, even some of the so-called brand name manufacturers, have participated. But it's been an arduous journey. We've tracked the success of hospital buying groups for some 12 to 15 years. They likewise had a difficult time getting started. We've been in existence for 5 to 6 years now, and it's starting to show. Senator WARNER. Let's see if another witness wants to comment on just the marketplace and the forces within it, the driving com- petition. Mr. BARTON. Senator Warner, I would love to comment on that. That's a very good question you ask: Why doesn't the economic principles drive this? And one of the reasons is that physicians pre- scribe the medicine (and I've heard from many physicians), but they are not paying the cost.6There are four pharmaceutical com- panies, for example, that sell the ulcer medicine. They don't mind competing with each other. They're going to go out and see that provider and convince that provider their drug is best. But it's the client or the client's insurance company that's paying for that drug. The client is not the one who decides what drug is going to be 6 For further information, see appendix 4, p. 570, Study of Physician Perceptions of Drug Prices.ill used. And that's one of the reasons the economic principles will notnecessarily work in the drug market.Senator WARNER. So the consensus is, normal economic princi-ples just don't control this unique market?Mr. BARTON. Right. You normally don't ask how much is this drug going to cost. Alot of people won't if the insurance company is paying for it.Senator WARNER. Anyone else want to tackle that?[No response.] Senator WARNER. Let me ask in the minute left here-The CHAIRMAN. You have a minute left.Senator WARNER. You're participating, the Public Health Serviceis participating in the DBA and the procurement partner. Arethere some savings in the PHS system as a result of that jointeffort? Mr. STYRSKY. PHS has received the same benefits that DVA andDOD have received. Yes, Senator.Senator WARNER. I thank the Chair.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Warner, thank you.Now if I might, I'm going to take 3 minutes. Let's turn onceagain to our friend in the bottle here, Mr. Motrin. There we havethe Medicare paying $29 for that bottle of Motrin, and the VApaying $5. Now, Mr. Styrsky, has anyone from Medicare, Medicaid,HCFA, anyone else, ever come to you and said, Mr. Styrsky, howdo you buy all this so cheaply, all these drugs? I mean, this is notjust one, this is just an example. Have they ever asked you aboutthis? Mr. STYRSKY. No, they have not.The CHAIRMAN. Has there ever been any indication that there'san interest in saving some money in the Medicare program?Mr. STYRSKY. They have not contacted me.The CHAIRMAN. Does HCFA, for example, know what Medicare ispaying for this bottle of Motrin?Mr. STYRSKY. I don't know.The CHAIRMAN. So they haven't expressed an interest, as far asyou know, in finding out how you purchase so inexpensively?Mr. STYRSKY. No, sir, that's right.The CHAIRMAN. Now, I'm going to place five letters in the recordto bolster Mr. Barton. One is from Glaxo, one is Marion Laborato-ries, Roche Laboratories, Parke-Davis, and Bristol-Myers. ThePACE Alliance was evidently trying to get some competitive bid-ding going on pharmaceuticals. These were dated mostly in July1988, 1 year ago. One letter, for example, says, \"currently, ourpolicy at Glaxo is not to bid to retail pharmacies or retail pharma-cy buying groups,\" which substantiates your claim. And this otherone from Marion Laboratories says, \"we will be unable to offer aquotation at this time as our current bidding policy precludes ouroffering quotations to organizations such as yours.\"Further, Roche Laboratories stated: \"Current policy does notpermit us to offer prices to your trade category at this time.\"And so it goes on and on, and I will place these five letters in therecord at this point. I think they bear out what you have said, thatthey have been most uncooperative in attempting to deal.[The five pharmaceutical company letters follow:]112 MARION LABORATORIES, INC.

Now, once again I'm going to yield back my 12seconds, and we'll start at the first, Senator Grassley.Senator GRASSLEY. Well, just one question.Dennis, can you give us some sense of the magnitude of VA pur-chases that would allow you to negotiate such volume discounts asyou do? I don't think that's been brought out. What percentage ofthe market, or how much do you buy?Mr. STYRSKY. I think the key issue is how much we buy. In oursystem we have a redistribution, and through our depot redistribu-tion system we purchase annually, approximately, $240 million indrugs, prescription drug products. And we do buy in larger quanti-ties. It's very economic for the manufacturer. There are three dis-tribution points and a single billing point. So there is an economyinvolved there that assists us greatly in our negotiations.Senator GRASSLEY. Do you know what percentage of the totalmarket for prescription drugs that is in the country?Mr. STYRSKY. The Government market is approximately 5 per-cent of the total market. Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I'm done.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Grassley.Senator Kohl. Senator KOHL. I just have a single question here, by way of astatement and a comment. For the single source nitroglycerin patch, which is known asNitro Dur, according to my information, hospitals pay as little as 1cent for 30 patches, the VA pays $4 for 30 patches, and the cost tothe retail pharmacist is over $30 for 30 patches. A cent, $4, $30.Can anybody make any sense out of this? Does anybody want totell us something about how the system works, or the equities of it,or the remedies for that? Mr. Barton. Mr. BARTON. Especially in the example you gave, hospitals; mostpharmaceutical companies will give hospitals their.drugs free, nobidding at all, because they want the training physicians to get useto it, and student physicians to get used to prescribing that drug.And so that's one of the reasons they get it almost free, and whyothers don't, I don't know. I'd be glad to yield.Mr. STYRSKY. I would agree as far as the hospitals, it's a greatsource of introduction to their product. Mr. MINcY. The same, Senator.Senator KOHL. So, what we're getting out of this is that it is-and not necessarily to be condemned, but it's a marketing strategythat the pharmaceutical companies use, introduce the product forwhatever it costs you, at its first point of usage, and then createthat demand, and then exact the profit at the end level. I mean, asI say, this is not illegal. It's not necessarily incorrect. But that's theway the system works. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kohl.Senator Kassebaum. Senator KASSEBAUM. I think the response of Mr. Barton to Sena-tor Warner's question really hits the nail on the head. You can'thave economic competition when your own pocketbook isn't reallyaffected. When you ve got third party providers, a person doesn tsense or feel financial responsibility. I think that sums it up.118 Senator WARNER. Could I just ask one further question? The CHAIRMAN. Senator Warner. Senator WARNER. I'm still concerned about the uniqueness of this marketplace. What about foreign competition? We've watched the American television industry. We started it, we built it, we lost it. Automobiles-we started, we built it, and we darned near lost it. We're getting it back. Now, we've got a great industry here, before Congress gets in and meddles around perhaps with laws and regu- lations. I'd hate to see us lose the quality that we're getting. Maybe the price isn't good, but nobody's arguing quality, are they? We've got the best in the world. What about foreign competition? Is that. a factor in this market? Mr. MINCY. It's not from my standpoint, sir. Mr. BARTON. It's not in ours either, but it could be. I think it very much could be. Senator WARNER. Are there certain laws prohibiting it? The Ger- mans have been preeminent in chemicals and things. Mr. BARTON. If FDA approves it, Medicaid agencies can use it. Senator WARNER. They can use it. But they have not been a factor in trying to bring about a balance of prices in this market thus far? [Shaking of heads.] Senator WARNER. Thank you very much. The CHAIRUAN. Thank you, Senator Warner. I want to thank the panel this morning. We're going to leave this record open for about 7 days so if there are any follow-on questions we can submit them in writing to you. And we're very, very indebt- ed for your testimony and for your constructive education of the committee today. Thank you very much. Our- next witness, ladies and gentlemen, is Mr. Gerald Mossing- hoff, who is president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Asso- ciation, Washington, DC. How are you, Mr. Mossinghoff? We appre- ciate your attendance today. We look forward to your statement, and then I'm sure the committee will have questions. STATEMENT OF GERALD MOSSINGHOFF, PRESIDENT, PHARMA- CEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, DC .Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate very much this opportunity to appear before this Committee, and I hope my comments will be helpful to the Committee. I do have several observations that I hope I can make on some of the graphics, Mr. Chairman, that you displayed at the beginning of the hearing. Major diseases that are among the most chronic and intractable in our society now primarily afflict older Americans. These include lung and colon cancers, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis and os- teoporosis, to name just a few of the many. Recent surveys by PMA determined that research-based pharmaceutical companies have 221 medicines in human tests that are waiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration to treat 23 of these diseases. I've at- tached to my statement a publication which shows the exact clini- cal status of these 221 medicines, and I summarize them in table 1 of my statement.119 Older Americans need these new medicines in development, andthey need even more the advanced therapies now in the very earlystages of development. Fully one-half of the $7.3 billion of privateresearch funds being invested by PMA companies this year in re-search and development is devoted to medicines for diseases thatprimarily afflict older Americans. Figure 1 shows the total re-search and development expenditures of PMA companies whichhave doubled every 5 years since 1970, and compares those to theexpenditures of the NIH for all biomedical research. This year weoutstripped NIH in the dollar amount of research and develop-ment. In human terms the new medicines that will result from our in-dustry will have a profound effect on how long Americans live andtheir quality of life in their later years. But these medicines willalso have an enormous economic impact. They will save billions ofdollars in the rest of the health-care system.We hope that, as the committee continues its consideration of theresearch-based industry, it keeps three key characteristics in mind.One is that ours is a comparatively small and highly competitiveindustry. If the worldwide sales of PMA companies were combinedin one hypothetical company, that company would be ranked nohigher than seventh among the Fortune 500. That's all the compa-nies that PMA represents. No company commands more than 8percent of the market, and sales of 22 companies must be combinedto reach 75 percent of the market. And as Senator Warner noted,we're proud that it is an-industry that has a positive trade balancerather than a negative trade balance.Second, PMA companies devote a far higher percentage of theirsales to research and development than any other high-technologyindustry in the United States. Last year the industry invested 16.3percent of sales in research and development, an increase from 10percent in 1965. The industry standard, according to recent arti-cles, is 3.4 percent. So we're three or four times that, at least, interms of R&D to sales.Finally, the industry's share, and this is extremely important, ofthe U.S. health-care dollar has decreased sharply from 12.4 percentin 1965 to 6.8, roughly half, in 1987, as illustrated in Figure 3 of mystatement. Mr. Chairman, I hope the rest of my statement can be put in therecord. I would like to use my 5 minutes to comment on some ofthe graphics that you displayed.The CHAIRMAN. Feel free to do so.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. First I would respectfully submit, and it'swith great respect, Mr. Chairman, that the me-too factor chart ispretty misleading. The ratings of A, B, and C are set by the Foodand Drug Administration. A priori, when a drug comes in, they setthat and it determines how it paces through the FDA.In the C category are whole new classes of drugs: ACE Inhibitors,for example, approved during the 1980's and Calcium ChannelBlockers, which could very well obviate very expensive bypass sur-gery. On one of your charts that I saw, you had Zantac, and wellyou should, because that's the highest volume drug sold in theworld. That was a 1-C drug when it went to FDA. So I wouldsubmit that although your figures are obviously accurate, they are121 PharmaceuticalManufacturers Association GERALD J. MOSSINGHOFF PRESIDENT PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION .BEFORE THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING UNITED STATES SENATE JULY 18, 1989 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: -I am Gerald J. Mossinghoff, President of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.Association. PMA represents more than 100 research-based pharmaceutical companies that discover, develop and produce most of the prescription medicines used in the United States. I appreciate this opportunity to appear before the special Committee during these hearings. I hope msy comments will be helpful to the Committee. Mr. Chairman, as this Committee keenly appreciates, the miracle medicines invented, developed and produced by America's research-based pharmaceutical industry have been enormously successful in lengthening lives and in improving the quality of life of older Americans and of people of all ages around the world. The death rates from many diseases have declined impressively in recent years. In the cardiovascular area -- the diseases that are the leading killers of older Americans .-- the death rate has dropped 42% tn the last 20 years. Medicines have played an important role in that progress, starting with the thiazide diuretics of the 1960s through the-beta blockers of the 1970s to today's calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and cholesterol-lowering and anti-clotting drugs. While progress-against hypertension, stroke and other cerd.iovascular diseases has been impressive, that group of illnesses still afflict millions of people in the prime of their seniority. And the aging of America has created new and even more demanding challenges for our whole system of health care, including the pharmaceutical industry. Major diseases that are among the most chronic and intractable in our society now - primarily afflict older Americans. These include lung and colon cancers; Alzheimer's Disease; osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis, to name just a few. Recent surveys by PMA determined that companies have 221 medicines in human tests or awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration to treat 23 diseases that primarily strike the elderly, as summarized in Table 1. A tabulation of the overall results of the PMA surveys is attached to my statement, giving the clinical status of each new medicine.120 based on this a priori rating set at the beginning of the time beforethey've had any serious review, and they don't recalibrate it, be-cause all it is is a method for pacing drugs through.I might also add that we've got our Medical Director, Senior VicePresident John Beary, with us. These so-called \"me-too\" drugs, andthat's clearly something of a pejorative term that is used, haveenormous differences in terms of side effects and profiles. Manypeople can tolerate one drug in a certain class, but not another. SoI don't think the medical profession would regard these \"me-too\"drugs as anything like a superfluous addition. They'd regard themas a valuable part of the armamentarium.Secondly, I would note that the $125 million that is on yourchart of our advertisement is based on a study by Professor Wig-gins that was done for PMA, but is independently confirmed bytwo or three other studies that I could cite. One was by StanfordResearch Institute a very quick-look study, but that didn't considerthe time value of money. And obviously when you invest moneyover a 10-year period, the cost to the company is more than justthe out-of-pocket expense. And then, finally, I don't believe-I again respectfully submit-that Motrin which you showed would cost the amount somehow at-tributed to it for Medicare, because that's off-patent. That's ibupro-fen. Generic substitutes are on the market, and under the formulathat the Congress adopted, the median generic price would be theone that would be paid, not $29. So, I think, while I'm not challeng-ing the fact there may be examples, I don't think Motrin is a goodexample because that's an off-patent drug at this point.Mr. Chairman, I would like to say one last thing about the pricesinternationally. And that is that they vary all over the lot, becauseall countries have different systems of regulation, drug approval,time of regulation. On page 10 of my statement, Table 2, I show thedifferences within the European Common Market, which is a rela-tively homogeneous set of 12 European countries for a basket of100 drugs. The prices vary from $61 in Portugal to $146 in the Fed-eral Republic of Germany. And the average comes right about inthe middle. Finally, the average earning power has to be considered. U.S.citizens pay less than at least two countries, West Germany andFrance, where there are very rigorous regulations, and pay less percapita for drug expenditures a year. And that's shown in table 3 ofmy statement and explained in detail in footnote 3 on how wereached that conclusion. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my very brief opening statement.However there's a lot more I would like to tell the committee.[The prepared statement of Mr. Mossinghoff follows:]122 .

And they need even more the advanced therapies now in the very early stages of research. As you recently pointed out, Mr. Chairman, we spend over $167 billion a year to treat medical conditions of the elderly, and we must \"learn how to better treat and prevent the .diseases that too-;often accompany old-age.\" History confirms that the vast majority of new medicines needed by the elderly will come from the research-based pharmaceutical industry. Fully half of the $7.3 billion of private funds being invested by PMA companies this year in research and development is devoted to medicines for diseases that primarily afflict older Americans. Figure l shows the total research and development expenditures of PMA companies since 1977, and compares those expenditures -- which have doubled every five years since 1970 -- with the total research and development spending of the National Institutes of Health for all biomedical research. R&D Expenditures by NIH and PMA Members StBiU.. 1979-1988 1984 1985 1956 1987 1988- * I H of Alh o PMA M-mbk, Comn.-\"ie Figure 1123 In human terms, the new medicines that will result from our industry's R&D will have a profound effect on how long Americans will live and on their quality of life in their later years. But these new medicines will also have an enormous economic impact. Alzheimer's Disease, virtually unrecognized a generation ago, has been estimated to cost our nation more than $50 billion a year -- about twice the entire annual U.S. sales of PMA members. Former Secretary of Health, Education and welfare Joseph A. Califano, Jr. recently estimates that \"each one-month reduction of dependency for our citizens over 65 means a $4 billion savings in annual health care and custodial costs alone.\" We hope that this Committee will keep in mind three key characteristics of the research-based pharmaceutical industry as these hearings proceed: (1) It is a comparatively small and highly competitive industry. If the worldwide sales of PMA members were to becombined in one company, that company would rank no higher than seventh among the Fortune 500 companies. No company commands more than 8% of the U.S. market, and the sales of 22 companies must be combined to reach 75% of that market. (2) PMA companies devote a far higher percentage of their sales to R&D than any other high-technology industry. Last year, the industry invested 16.3% of its sales in R&D, an increase from 10.2% in 1965, as shown in Figure 2. In a staff report issued in 1987, Chairman Waxman's House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment estimated that over 34% of the sales revenues resulting from price increases of prescription drugs from 1982 through 1986 was invested back into R&D. No other U.S. industry can match that record. (3) The industry's share of the U.S. health-care dollar has decreased sharply from 12.4% in 1965 to 6.8% in 1987, as illustrated in Figure 3. And to my knowledge no one seriously questions the fact that this small share of the health-care expenditure pays for the most cost-effective form of medical therapy. For example, in its first 10 years, the anti-ulcer drug Tagamet saved $4 billion in the United States alone. In your letters announcing this hearing, Mr. Chairman, you indicate that the Committee will consider three matters: prices of pharmaceuticals, differential pricing in the United States and price differences of pharmaceuticals inter- nationally. Let me discuss these matters in turn. R&D Expenditures as a Percentage of U.S. PharmaceutiC SaleC R&D % (1oclud. U.S. scs pha 0985 1938 Figure 2124 Drugs (and Other Nondurable Medical Products) as a Percentage of National Health Care Expenditures H.lhh Erodi- -312_ Prce brand-name soon after the-patent on; the drug expires. Because generics can be made so cheaply, this has drastically shortened the product life cycle of brand-named drugs. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act itself is analogous to a two-act play. We have already seen the economic effects of the pro-generic substitution part of the play. The second act of the play -- having to do with patent term restoration -- is only now beginning, only five of the 61 pharmaceutical- patents whose terms have been extended would have expired by now had extensions not been granted. And no patent has been extended more than-two years because of -the way the law was written. Other major- forces which shorten the time during which. the companies can recover their sizeable R&D expenses include the intense competition within the research-based pharmaceutical industr~y to develop and market new patented drugs, long delays in FDA' s approval of new drugs and inoreasing foreign competition from both developed countries that have targeted this industry and newly industrialized countries that blatantly condone patent piracy. As noted in a May 13 article in The Economist, \" X . during the past decade the profitable lifetime of drugs has declined while the costs of testing and marketing, which now must be worldwide in order to recoup big investments, have escalated. \" Professor Steven N. Wiggins of Texas A&M has estimated that the average cost to bring a new medicine from discovery to the pharmacy exceeds $125 million.125 With respect to price increases of prescription drugsin recent years, the largest single factor in manufacturers'costs, but not the sole factor, has been the sharp increase ininvestments in R&D. Figure 4 compares the prescription drugprice index, established at the 1982-84 base, to an \"R&D index\"based on that same starting period. R&D spending in our industryfar outstrips the price index. Costs of labor, materials, taxesand promotion have also increased.

The subject area generally addressed by theChairman's letter is frequently referred to as \"differential\"pricing, and we feel it is very important to the Committee'sdeliberations that it understand the background and context ofthat term. Differential pricing is regulated by the Robinson-Patman Act, enacted in 1936 to equalize the commercial power oflarger purchasers and smaller, independent buyers. The Actprohibits sellers from unlawfully discriminating in price bymaking price differences unlawful where the effect of thedifferences may be to lessen competition, or to tend to create amonopoly in any line of commerce or to injure, destroy or preventcompetition. Differential prices resulting from differences inthe cost of manufacture, sale or delivery are not prohibited, norare differential prices to meet competition. In addition, the Congress in 1938 enacted the NonprofitInstitutions Act exemption to Robinson-Patman that exempts non-profit institutions, including charities, schools and hospitals,from the ban on selling at a different price so long as thepurchases are for the institution's own use. This Act embodiesthe strong public policy in favor of allowing sellers to provideproducts at lower prices to charitable purchasers. SeveralFederal Court cases have defined the application of the NonprofitInstitutions Act to the pharmaceutical industry, with the lastmajor case decided in 1984. Apparently the law, which has beenin effect for over 50 years, is well understood by all parties inthe pharmaceutical marketplace apd is not generating anysignificant level of litigation. 31-352 0 -90 -5126 with respect to sales to government agencies, it is important to note the very different nature of a buyer who assumes the responsibility for distribution, warehousing, shipping and follow-up services as opposed to an individual retailer or smell group of retailers who take on almost none of that burden. In general, it seems clear that over the years many sellers, including sellers in the pharmaceutical industry, have used the flexibility afforded by the Robinson-Patman Act to meet competition in the marketplace and to observe the special status of \"not-for-profit\" or charitable organizations. With regard to both domestic and international prices, your letter sets \"AWP,\" the published Average Wholesale Price, as the standard of comparison. This can lead to quite erroneous conclusions. The 1984 Health and Human Services Inspector General Report documented the fact that most retailers purchase products at prices often well below AWP. In a six-state survey of pharmacies, the Inspector General found that 99.6% of drug purchases were made at prices averaging 16% below AWP. These drug purchases ranged from as little as .23% below AWP to as much as 42% below AWP. In the Finance Committee and Conference Committee deliberations on the drug provisions of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, the artificial nature of AWP was noted, and provision was made in the Act, with the full support of the PMA, for Government surveys to determine actual prices. Price Differences Internationally Clearly, there are differences in the absolute prices of pharmaceutical products from country to country. Comparisons cannot stop at the absolute price levels alone. Because there is not a single, free, world market for pharmaceuticals, price differences country-by-country are unavoidable. Currency fluctuations are a major cause. One company's analysis shows that a hypothetical product introduced in eight foreign countries in 1982 at the exact same price of one U.S. dollar, would in 1988 be sold at prices which differed by more than 300% due to currency fluctuations alone. These price differences country-to- country -- resulting solely from currency fluctuations -- are shown in Figure 5. Exchange Rate Effect Product Intro 1982 at Equivalent of $1 hime 1I8 There are many other reasons for international price differences beyond currency fluctuations. These include differing approval times, differing standards of medical practice, differences in customary dosages, packaging127 differences, varying patterns of wholesale and retail markupsand, of course, widely different price control and reimbursementschemes. One further major difference between the U.S. andvirtually all other markets is the high cost associated withproduct liability and the tort system in the U.S. In a recent study of prices on the European CommonMarket,2 overall price levels for a basket of over 100 drugsvaried widely, as shown in Table 2. Countries classified According to Prices of DrugsWhen compared with Average Retail Pricesin the European community (in European Currency Units) Total price for Indexthe sample of EEC averageCountry Furthermore, the study showed that prices forindividual products varied significantly in different CommonMarket countries. Again, several factors account for variations,both within the Common Market and for countries outside of it. In Sweden, for example, there are no privately ownedpharmacies. The Government manages the distribution system andplaces-rigorous controls on all the participants. In my view,there is little if anything in the Swedish system that commendsitself to U.S. adoption. France also has a distribution system quite differentfrom ours. The French Government strictly limits the number ofpharmacies that can exist, basing the number on a strict ratio tothe number of persons in a village or town, essentially elimi-nating competition between pharmacy outlets. Manufacturers,pricing is also strictly controlled. -According to recentstudies, this system has damaged France's indigenous researchcapability. Between 1961 and 1977 France was second only to theUnited States in drug discoveries. It has now slipped to fifthplace after being overtaken by Japan, West Germany and Italy. Ican report from personal conversations with French officials thatefforts are underway to review their system and hopefully redressthis imbalance. In 1969 Canada amended its patent laws to establishcompulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents, rendering patentsvirtually useless as an incentive to innovation. The robustCanadian pharmaceutical R&D enterprise quickly atrophied. Lastyear, with encouragement from the U.S. Government, Canada movedtoward harmonizing its patent laws with those of other developedcountries by modifying the compulsory licensing provisions. Thatwas an first important step, but the Canadian system ofprotection still falls short of the standards of other developedcountries.128 The relative purchasing power of the people of the several countries must also be considered to get a total picture of the different prices of pharmaceuticals in these countries. For example, the average French worker must work approximately two hours and 30 minutes to pay for an average French prescrip- tion, whereas a U.S. worker need only work for one hour and 11 minutes to pay for an average U.S. prescription. Even in Sweden, which has tight government controls, an average Swedish prescription represents an hour and 22 minutes of earning power. In a similar vein, Table 3 compares the number of hours a 'production worker in manufacturing\" (the standard used for international comparisons by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) must work to earn the equivalent of the cost of the annual per capita drug expenditure in each of the six European countries listed in the Chairman's request for data in connection with these hearings. The number of hours of work to earn that equivalent varies from a low of 9.32 in Sweden to a hi'gh of 17.19 in West Germany. PMA's estimate of the number of/hours a U.S. worker must work to pay for an annual per capita drug expenditure in the U.S. is 16.03 hours.3 Another major factor in international markets is that some countries, most notably Brazil,/Argentina and India, blatantly condone patent piracy and provide either no patent protection or totally inadequate patent protection for our companies' inventions. In this regard, PMA has filed several petitions with the U.S. Trade Representative, and we are hopeful that those petitions and either the threat of or actual trade sanctions will help convince patent pirate countries to live up to their responsibility to protect intellectual property. PMA actively supported the intellectual property provisions of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, and we welcome the support key members of this Committee have provided in reinforcing the actions of the U.S. Trade Representative. We hope that those actions -- including the naming of flagrant patent-pirate nations to a so- called \"priority watch list\" under the special 301 procedures -- will result in those countries agreeing to live up to their responsibilities as a fair trading partner of the United States. .~~~* * * Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have. Annual Drug Expenditures Compared with workers Earning Power (Local currency) Work Hours Needed 1987 Drug 1987 Average to Cover Annual Expe-dltures Populatlon Hourly Per Capita Drug Country (billlons) (millions) Compensation 8.383 95.99 9.32 Table 3129 FOOTNOTES The landmark case interpreting the applicability of theNonprofit Institutions Act to the pharmaceutical industry isAbbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association,Inc., 96 S.CT. 1305 (1976). The Supreme Court held that theNonprofit Institutions Act exemption for purchases of supplies bya nonprofit hospital for its \"own use\" does not exempt all ofsuch a hospital's drug purchases from the Robinson-Patman Act.The exempt purchases are those that reasonably may be regarded asused by the hospital for the care of its patients. The Courtclassifed several categories of sales and uses as being within orwithout the \"own use\" exemption. A second major Federal Court interpretation of the NonprofitInstitutions Act was made by the Ninth Circuit in Mario de Modenadba Sixth Avenue Pharmacy v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.,743 F.2d 1388 (9th Cir. 1984). The Robinson-Patman Actallegations in this case were quite similar to those in AbbottLaboratories above. The defendants were a number of relatedcorporations, including regional health plans, regional medicalgroups and nonprofit hospitals, as well as several pharmaceuticalmanufacturers. The Court of Appeals affirmed motions for summaryjudment finding that the defendants were not liable for-violatingthe Robinson-Patman Act because they were within the exception tothat Act created by the Nonprofit Institutions Act. The Courtspecifically found that drug purchases made by the Kaiser groupfor resale to their members were exempt from the Robinson-PatmanAct. However, the Court found that purchases made by the groupfor resale to non-members were not within the NonprofitInstitutions Act exemption. There were two additional Federal Court cases decided during the1980s that are almost identical in form and substance to theAbbott Laboratories case above: Mountain View Pharmacy v. AbbottLaboratories, 630 F.2d 1383 (lOth Cir. 1980) and Rudner v. AbbottLaboratories, 664 F.StJPP. 1100 (N.D. Ohio 1987). In Mountainview Pharmacy, the Court of Appeals affirmed a District Courtdismissal of the complaint against all but two defendants. TheCourt found that the complaint did not provide defendants withsufficient notice for a responsive pleading. The case waseventually settled without trial with respect to the tworemaining defendants. In Rudner, after a District Court deni.lof the defendants' motions for-summary judgment, the case wassettled with respect to all defendants without furtherproceedings. There is just one other case during the last 15 years in theFederal Court system involving allegations of Robinson-Patmanviolations by pharmaceutical manufacturers, Jefferson CountyPharmaceutical Association, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratonres, 460 U.S.150 (1983). This case was brought by a trade association ofretail pharmacists and pharmacies against several manufacturers,130 the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama, which operated pharmacies in connection with its hospitals, and an Alabama county hospital pharmacy. The defendants contended that sales of pharmaceutical products to state and local government hospitals for resale in competition with private retail pharmacies were exempt from the Robinson-Patman Act. The Supreme Court held that such sales are not exempt from the Act. 2 Drug Prices and Drug Legislation in Europe, An Analyis of the Situation in the Twelve Member States of the European Communities, G. Sermeus and G. Adriaenssens, Belgian Consumers' Union, Bureau of European Unions of Consumers (BEUC)/112/89, March 1989, p. 412. PMA has not undertaken independently to verify these data. 3 The first column--1987 Drug Expenditures--of the table \"Annual Drug Expenditures Compared with Workers Earning Power (Local Currency)\" consists of estimates provided by the Office of Health _ Economics of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. Figures include prescription and over-the-counter sales, in retail outlets and hospitals, and are shown in national currencies. The second column--1987 Population--is from Table No. 1378, Population and Area, by Region and Country, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1988, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Bureau of the Census. The third column--Average Hourly Compensation--is from Table 3, Hourly Compensation Costs in National Currency for Production Workers in Manufacturing, 34 Countries or Areas, 1975-1988, in International Comparisons of Hourly Compensation Costs for Production Workers in Manufacturing, 1975 and 1978-1988, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 1989. The fourth column--work Hours Needed to Cover Annual Per Capita Drug Expenditures--was obtained by dividing drug expenditures by population, and then dividing that figure (per capita drug expenditures) by average hourly compensation. The prescription-drug expenditures portion of the U.S. estimate of total drug expenditures was based on an unpublished PMA study, Consumer Expenditures for Drugs, 1971-1985, by G. Trapnell and J. Genuardi of Actuarial Research Corporation. The over-the-counter expenditures portion of the U.S. estimate was based on a Nielsen Market Research Survey reported in the April 17, 1989 issue of Drug Topics. The number of hours a U.S. worker must work to pay for an annual per capita drug expenditure was calculated in the same manner as the estimates for all the other countries.131 IN DEVELOPMENTP NEW MEDICINES FOR OLDER AMERICANS Presented by tbe Pbarmaceutical Manufacturers Association January 1989 221 Medicines in Development to Treat 23 Diseases of Older Persons PMA's \"New Medicines for Older Americans\" project consisted of a series ofsurveys of pharmaceutical compa- nies to identify all medicines cur- rently in clinical development for diseases that primarily afflict older Americans. Here are the results of these surVeys: * 221 medicines are in human tests to treat 23 diseases that primarily afflict older persons.* An estimated S3.6 billion will go into research on such diseases in 1989-approximately half of the industry's projected 17.3 billion research and development budget for the year.* Cardiovascular disease leads all others as a target for research spending and drugs in develop- ment. Some 26 percent of all research funds went into cardio- vascular research in 1987; and 87drugs are being tested for use against heart disease, hypertension and stroke. * Cancer drugs are the second largest category of drugs in development for older persons. Some 65 cancer drugs that are now in human testing are intended to treat cancers commonly associ- ated with older persons. Colon, breast and lung cancers are the most frequently targeted cancers.* Research also is strong on medicines for the diseases that most often result in loss of inde- pendence for older persons. The surveys showed 48 companies are developing 69 new drugs thatwill treat 9 diseases that often crip- ple and disable older persons. Among these are 15 drugs in devel- opment for Aklheimer's disease, another 25 for arthritis, 10 for osteoporosis and 6 for Parkinson's disease. Research on these diseases holds the potential for keeping the elderly independent longer and reducing the necessity for long- term care. * Biotechnology has given a great boost to anticancer drug research. 29 percent of anti-cancer drugs identified are biotechnology- based. A separate PMA survey shows that half of all biotechnology drugs are for cancer. Biotechnology has become important to cancer research because it helps explain how cancers develop in the body and enables researchers to boost the body's immune system to fight cancers. PMA sought and received the cooperation of several organiza- tions in this project: Alliance for Aging Research, American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Associ- ation, Arthritis Foundation, College of Cardiology, and National Coun- cil on the Aging. The \"New Medicines for Older Americans\" project has revealed a sizeable collection of new medi- cines in tests for diseases that are among the most chronic and problematic in our society. With the aging of its population, America nerds research on these diseases and the medicines this research will produce. copeM & i 98n9 by dohr r-nOverview ofSurvey Results PMA's survey of medicines in human testing for diseases that commonly affilict the aging found 221 individual products, 54 of which are being tested for use against more than one disease, resulting in a total of 301 research and development projects. Following is the number of drugs being tested by disease: Cardiovascular Disease Hypenension 38 Congestive Stroke (Cerebral Thr-mbosis) 6 Other 2 Cancer Colon 20Breast 16 Lung 14 Skin I IProstate 10 Mouth (Ora Cavity) IOther' 25 '(drugs thug Arthritis 15Ost-tahrttis 10 Osteoporosis tOParinson's Disease 6 Adult Onset Diabetes 4 Glaucoma 3 Gout 2 Total 301132 IN DEVELOPMENTO NEW MEDICINES FOR OLDER AMERICANS Presented by the Pbarmaceutical Manufacturers Association In cooperation Couil on the Aging January 1989 Research on Aging Increases 69 New Drugs in Testing for 9 Debilitating Diseases America's research- based pharmaceutical companies are developing 69 new drugs intended to treat 9 diseases that often cripple and disable older persons. These drugs are being developed by 48 companies. Ten of the 69 drugs are being tested for more than one indi- cation, or use, resulting in 81 separate research and develop- ment projects. These are listed separately in the attached chart. Three diseases that are lead- ing causes of nursing home admissions are targets for more than half of the 81 research projects identified in this PMA survey: * 25 drugs are in develop- ment for arthritis (15 for rheu- matoid arthritis and 10 for osteoarthritis), * 15 for Alzheimer's disease, and * 10 for osteoporosis, Effective treatments for these three debilitating diseases will not only make life more livable in later years, but reduce the costs associated with long term care. Also in development for dis-eases that primarily affect older persons are: * 16 drugs for depression, * 6 for Parkinson's disease, * 4 for adult onset diabetes, * 3 for glaucoma, and * 2 for gout. Adult Onset Diabetes .Alzheimer's Disease Arthritis Third of a series on New Medicines for Older Americans. These findings are the latest in the PMA \"New Medicines for Older Americans\" series that seeks to identify all medicines that have reached the human test stage for diseases that have a major impact on older persons. Earlier surveys identified 87drugs for heart disease, stroke and hypertension, and 65 for cancers common to older peo- ple. The 221 medicines in development by 77 companies revealed by these surveys were in 23 disease categories. PMA member companies will invest an estimated 57.3 billion this year in research and development. It is clear from these surveys that an increasing share of this research is going into the chronic diseases associated with aging. With these surveys, we have gained insight into the enormous commitment of the pharmaceuti- cal industry to developing important new drugs for the treatment of diseases that plague our older citizens. In the next few years, as these products emerge from the industry's research pipeline, we will see important advances on this critical medical frontier. GeraldJ.

These diseases deprive older persons of independence by Alimiting their function-physically and mentally. Quality of life is affected due to pain, depression, and financial stress. Arthritis alone cost the United States $8.6 billion, according to 1984 data from the Arthritis Foundation. Great psycho- logical and economic stress is placed on families and other caregivers. Diseases of aging deprive society of productive individuals and escalate health care costs. Some of these diseases are not well understood. In some cases, treatments are not available or have limited safety and efficacy. Often older persons must take a variety of medications to help treat their health problems, but medication to help one problem may exacerbate another. Thus there remains much to be learned about diseases of aging and the search continues for safe and effective new treatments. ADULT ONSET DIABETES A chronic disease characterized by abnormal insulin secretion from the pancreas, thereby causing problems in metabolizing sugar. Symptoms may include: excessive thirst, hunger, urination, and weight loss. Diet, exercise, and weight loss are often sufficient to control this disease. Insulin treatment is needed for only a minority of elderly diabetics. Oral drugs are useful in some patients. The American Diabetes Association says that nearly 3.1 million people over 65 had diabetes in 1987 and that nearly 26,000 diabetic patients over 65 were in nursing homes. More than 80,000 deaths were estimated to have been caused by diabetes in 1987. Total cost of institutional care of diabetic patients of all ages was 57.9 billion, the assocation estimates. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Chronic deterioration of all mental functions, with average onset around age 65. It is progressive and rarely reversible. Early manifestations include decrease in attention span, impaired powers of concentration, some per- sonality change and forgetfulness. It is difficult to diagnose, so often is not recognized at an early stage. As the disease progresses, there is loss of computational ability, word-finding problems, difficulty with ordinary activities such as dressing, cooking and balancing the checkbook, then severe memory loss and ulomately, complete disorientation, social with- drawal, and loss of independence. The personality changes may include aggressive outbursts, inappropriate sexual behavior, paranoia, and depression. The \"death of the mind\" has been described by both patients and family members as \"the most horrible death imaginabIle.\" Theincreasing hours of care over many years lead to family stress, marital prob- lems, bankruptcy, and the development of physical disorders, as well as severe depression and anxiety in the care- givers. There are no medications available that reverse the primary characteristics of the disease. Drugs are frequently used to treat symptoms such as agitation, depression, and psychosis. According to the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Asso- ciation, an estimated 2.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's and more than 100,000 are estimated to have died of Alzheimer's in 1988. The organization says that about 540 billion-S50 billion a year is spent caring for patients at home and in nursing facilities. ARRHYTHMIA Abnormal heart rhythm, usually detected by an electrocardiogram. Arehythmias can be caused by several factors, such as coronary artery disease, heart valve problems or hyperthyroidism. ATHEROSCLEROSIS A common disease in which deposits of plaque containing fatty substances, such as cholesterol, are formed within the inner layers of the arteries. A common name for it is \"hardening of the arteries.' Atherosclerosis is a progressive condition over decades, chiefly affecting the arteries of the heart, brain, and extremities. Its complications, such as coronary artery disease and strokes, are the major causes of death in the United States. CANCER Cancer is second only to cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death in older people. The single greatest risk for most cancers is increasing age. The American Cancer Society estimatesthat nearly I million Americans were diagnosed as having cancer in 1988 and more than half of them were over age 65. Cancers most prevalent among older people are: COLON CANCER, which struck an estimated 105,000 persons in 1988 and proved fatal for 53,500, 94% of those diag- nosed with colorectal cancer were over age 50, BREAST CANCER, with about 135,000 new cases diagnosed in 1988, 42,000 women died of the disease, the incidence in women age 50 and older has been increasing since 1950, LUNG CANCER, the leading cause of cancer deaths, incidence of lung cancer sharply increases after age 55, there were an estimated 152,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States in 1988 and approximately 139,000 deaths; PROSTATE CANCER with an esti- mated 99,000 new cases and 28,000 deaths in 1988, about 80% of pros- tate cancers are diagnosed in men over 65; SKIN CANCER including the most serious type, malignant melanoma, which occurs in about 27,000 people annually and causes 5,800 deaths; and MOUTH CANCER, which was diagnosed in about 30,000 people in 1988 and killed more than 9,000. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE Cardiovascular diseases that com- monly afflict older persons include arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, conges- tive heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Ieart disease is the lead- ing cause of death in the United States, particularly among older per- sons, and stroke ranks third. (See more on the individual diseases listed under their names.)I I139 CONGESTIVE-HEART FAILURE The end resuft of many diffeent types *ofteatdiscase. iTh heart camnutnump blood out normally. This results in -congestion (water and salt retention) in the iongs, swelling in dhictremities, andmduced blood flow to body tissues. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Caused by athetrscerosis of the artenes that supply the beart. Angina (decreased blood flow to the hen. muscle) causes chest pain in the areaof the heart. Heart attacks and conges tive heart failure result from coronary artery disease. It is the most common cause of cardioascular disability and death in the United States. DEPRESSION May result from a number of bio- logic. sociologic and psychologic factors associated with aging: decreasing mental and physical abili- ties, multiple medical problems, chronic pain, loss of independence, change in tfrstyle such as retire- ment, death of friends and family members, children moving away, and economic msecurtty. Early dementia and depression may be confused with one another. It is characterized by. loss of interest or pleasure in usual acttities. sadness, feelings of hopelessess, ientability, poor appetite, insomnia, loss of energy, and lack of concentrtion. Suictdal thoughts may occur. Deprs sion occurs in one third of patterns with Parkinson s disease and a sub- stantal numhbr of stroke victims. It is treatable using sosal support, psychotherapy and medication. About 8% of the 28.5 million people over 65had symptoms of depenion, according to 1985 estimates by the American Psychiatric Association. Many patients in nursing homes have psychitric disorders, indudimg depression according to the association. GLAUCOMA An eye dtsease associated with increased pressure within the eye- hall. If untreated, it may lead to per-manent and complete blindness. Its onset is insidiotus in older age groups. There e nosymptoms in early stges. Gradual loss of penipheral vision ovMe period of years eventually results in tunnel vision. 1-2% of people over 40 have glaucoma; about 25 % of these csbes are undetected. Moe than I million people over 65 in 1987 had glaucoma, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.GOUT A type of arthitis characterized by an ecess of uric acid us the blood. Crystals of uric acid precipitate inside the joint cavity and set off an attack. Attacks occur suddenly, frequently at night, and often are accompanied by great pain. The feet, ankles, and knees are commonly affected, pareic- ularly the big toe. Proper drug treat- ment can quickly terminate the attack. About 95% of cases are in men. About I million Americans have gout, according to 1985 data from the Arthritis Foundation. HEART ATTACK A bloodclot in an artery obstructs blood flow and can cause a part of the heart muscle to die due to oxygen depnvation. Sudden death may occur. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE More than 60 million adults in the United States have hypertension. Without treatment it greatly increases the incdence ofcardiovascular dism se strokeand kidney failure. In about 95% of the cases, there is no known cause. OSTEOARTHRMS A degenerative disease in which car- tilage in the joints is worn away and reactive bony deposits form. t is the most common form of joint disease. According to 1985 data from the Arthritis Foundation, an estimated 15.8 million adults in the United States suffer from it. Incidence of the disease increases whth age. It usually involves large weight-bearing joints such as those of the hip, knee and lumbar spine, and tends to occur in joints that are damaged by diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, by traumma such as a fracture, by occupational over- use, or by neurologic disorders. Obesity may also play a role. In the late stagesjoints may become de- formed, motion is imited, and pain increases. It may require hip joint replacement. Spine involvemen causes low back pain, which is the most common cause of loss of work among older people. OSTEOPOROSIS The most comntmon metabolic bone disease m older people. t may be associated with other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or with the use of medication such as conico- stevioids. A reduction in bone mass leads to fractures especially of the vertebrae, hips, and wrists. 6-8 million white females suffer from it in the UnitedStates. 25% of all white females CuruP s 0-909 by he r e MA un, a u p _ .ion 0 an kd t via, a uover age 70 eentually develop frac- tures, loss of height. or chronic back pain due to vertebral compression. Collapsed or compressed serebrue produce dowager's hump.\" Fractures can caue catastrophic detenoration in quality of life and staggering expenses The cost of hip fractures alone may exceed II billion a year. Estrogen replacement therapy, calcium therapy. exercise, and other changes in lifestyle can play a role in prevention and treatment. PARKINSON'S DISEASE Chrorc neurologicdiseaseof unknown cause, characterized by tremors, rigidity, and an abnormal gait- There is an imbalance in the body of dopamine and acetylcholine, neurotransmitters normally present in the brain. Drug therapies may help restore this balance, but they may also caue serious side effects. Some patients with advanced disease develop dementia. I is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases of later life. The United Parkinson s Foundalioi cstiiiates that the average age of onset is early sixties; 3-5% ofthe population over,65 has Parkinson's. The organization estimates that about 10% ofParkinson's patients go to nursing homes. In the late stages of the disease, patients cannot wash, dress, or feed themselves. PERIPHERAL VASCULIAR DISEASE The obstruction of blood supply to the extremities particularly the legs, caused by atherosclerosis RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A chronic inflammatory disease of unknown Cauxs.lt chiefly. affects the synovial membranes-thin linings- of the joints, primarily the small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet, can iMvolve larger joints-the knees, ankles, and cervical spine. Symptoms include morning stiffness, joint swelling, and pain. Can eventually case joint deformities Incidence and preva- lence of this disease increases with age. Female patients outnumber males almost 3:1. R heumatoid arthritis p-aks in males of age 60-69 and in females 50-59. More than 2 million people have rheumatoid arthritis, according to 1985 data from the Arthritis Foundation. STROKE Usually caused by atherosclerosis. Ablood clot obstructs a major blood vessel of the brain. It results in death or serious brain damage, such as paralysis or loss of speech.140 IN DEVELOPMENT, NEW MEDICINES FOR OLDER AMERICANS - Presented by the Pbarmaceutical Manufacturers Association In cooperation withi the American Cancer Society December 1988 65 Drugs in Development Anti-Cancer Research Gaining Momentum, Survey Shows S ity-five cancer drugs that are now in development are targeted to treat cancers commonly associated with older persons-including breast, colon, lung, mouth, prostate and skin cancers. These 65 medicines are being developed by 45 companies The figures indicate that a strong anti-cancer research and development effort is underway by the nation's pharmaceutical companies- an effort that is significantly enhanced by biotechnology research techniques. At least 19 of these medicines- 29 percent-are biotechnology-based drugs. Biotechnology has become important to anticancer research becaus it helps explain how cancers develop in the body and enables researchers to boost the body's immune system to fight cancers. An earlier PMA survey of biotech- nology medicines in development found that approximately 50 per- cent-48 drugs-were targeted against cancers that afflict all ages. It scents clear that anti-cancer research is gathering momentum, although I must stress that the therapeutic significance of these medicines will not be known until clinical studies are completed and evaluated. PMA joins the Amencan Cancer Society in hoping that this listing of drugs in clinical trials will encourage more patients to volunteer for these trials. This cancer drug survey is pan of a broader PMA effort to identify all the products that are being developed to treat the principal diseases of older Americans. We are Attempting in these surveys to quantify theextensive private sector research against such diseases. The first survey in our \"New Medicines for Older Americans' series identified 87 drugs that are being developed by 47 companies for heart disease, stroke and hypertension. Cancer Second of a series on New Medicines for Older Americans. Cancer is second only to cardio- vascular disease as the leading cause of death in older people. The American Cancer Society estimates that 985,000 Americans wHd be diagnosed as having cancer in 1988, and modi than half of them will be over age 65. Nearly 60 percent of the 395,000 Americans who will die from cancer this year will be over age 65. Among the findings in the survey: * 14 of the 65 products are being tested for more than one indication, or use, resulting in 97 separate clinical test projects, each of which is listed in the chars.* 25 products being tested are for unspecified forms of cancer (listed under \"Other\" in the chat).* 20 drugs are being tested for colon cancer, which will strike an estimated 105,000 persons this year and prove fatal for 53,500; 94 percent of those diagnosed with colorectal cancer wil be over age 50. * 16 drugs are targeted to treat breast cancer. About 135,000 new cases ofbreast cancer will be diagnosed this year, and 42,000 women will die of the disease. Since 1950, the rate of death caused by breast cancer for women age 50 and older has been consistently increasing.* 14 are intended to treat lung cancer. Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and the leading cause of cancer deaths. The incidence of lung cancer sharply increases after age 55. There will be an estimated 152,000 new cases in the United States in 1988 and approximately 139,000 deaths.* 10 medicines are in tests or awaiting approval for prostate cancer. with an estimated 99,000 new cases and 28,000 deaths in 1988. About 80 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over 65 years old. * II drugs also are in tests or awaiting approval to treat skin cancers, including the most serious type, malignant melanoma, which occurs in about 27,0001 people annually and causes 5,800 deaths. * I product is intended to treat mouth (oral cavity) cancer, which will be diagnosed in about 3t),000 people this year, killing 9,10(). The final survey in our series of \"New Medicines for Older Americans' will identify medicine in development for arthritis, Alzheimer's and other diseases.

A new survey by the Pharma- ceutical Manufacturers Association shows 47 companies are developing 87 drugs for heart disease, hyper- tension and stroke, more than are being tested for any other disease. Pharmaceutical companies spend the largest portion of their research and development invest- ment-nearly 26 percent-on find- ing medicines for heart and circu- latory disease, accounting for approximately S 1.4 billion of the industry's S5.4 biflion research and development budget in 1987. The PMA survey of heart disease drugs in development is part of a series of surveys, \"New Medicines for Older Americans,\" conducted by the association. The results show products in the industry's research pipeline that are targeted for diseases that primarily afflict older persons. Details of the drugs in develop- ment for other aging diseases will be released by the PMA over a 4-month period in a series of charts. All the drugs in this first chart in the series-Heart/Stroke/ Hyper- tension-are in human test stages or awaiting approval at the Food and Drug Administration. 30 of the 87 products are being tested for more than one indica- tion, or use, resulting in 123 sepa-rate research and development projects. These are listed separately in the attached chart. The most concentrated testing and development is for hyperten- sion. Some 38 products are being tested for this use; all but 3 of them are in the final stages of development. Heart Disease Stroke Hypertension First of a series on New Medicines for Older Americans. Many products being tested for other cardiovascular diseases also are tested for hypertension because of its close association with other heart diseases. According to the Public Health Service, controlling high blood pressure can be one of the most effective means available of saving lives because hyperten- sion can lead to heart disease and stroke. The second most concentrated area of testing is congestive heart failure, the final and potentially fatal result of heart and vascular disease problems. There are 28 products in development for con- gestive heart failure, two-thirds of which are in advanced develop- ment stages. There are 8 products in tests for arrhythmia, 9 for atherosclerosis, 17 for coronary artery disease/angina, 7 for heart attack and 8 for peripheral vascular disease. Of the 6 products for stroke, 3 are versions of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which already is approved for treatment of heart attacks. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, parti- cularly among older persons, and stroke ranks third. Some 36 per- cent of all U.S. deaths are the result of heart disease and 7 per- cent are the result of stroke. Although the death rate from cardiovascular disease has dropped 41 percent in the past 20 years from 363 to 213 per 100,000 population, the aging of the population is likely to result in increased incidence of cardio- vascular disease. I am pleased to release this list of the 87 new drug therapies that are being developed for heart and circulatory diseases by the nation's pharmaceutical industry New medicines for older Americans hold the promise of longer, better quality lives and also can result in shorter hospital stays, fewer operations, and continued independence for older persons. With the increasing numbers of older persons in our society, this clearly is one of our industry's most important challenges. Gerald J.

Well, maybe you'll have a chance with a few of the questions here, Mr. Mossinghoff. I'll start off. Once again, we'll have the 3-minute rule, if we will have the timer placed on. We do thank you for you coming today, Mr. Mossinghoff. Many of your members that we invited did not. That is their prerogative. We issued no subpoenas. Now, do you feel that Congress, philosophically, should have a role in doing what we're doing? Do we have a role in looking at the prices that our consumers and taxpayers are paying for prescrip- tion drugs, :which are necessities of life? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. In some ways, Mr. Chairman, we welcome these hearings, because I think it will give us a chance to show what enormous benefit this declining share of the health-care dollar is. It started off in 1965 at about plus 12 percent and now it's down to about 6.8. And I don't think anyone seriously questions that that 6.8 percent of the health care dollar is the most cost-effec- tive. If, by using one of these 1-C ACE Inhibitors, you're able to obviate $40,000 heart bypass surgery, you've done a lot for the system.7The drug budget might be a problem because that is ex- pensive therapy, but for the system you've done an enormous bene- fit. So I no way question your right to look into this, and as I say, in some ways we welcome this inquiry. The CHAIRMAN. Some of your members I don't think welcome the inquiry, but that's their preorogative, and won't go into this. Now, you mentioned two or three of the C drugs that had been classified C by the Food and Drug Administration, little or no use, that they moved ultimately up into the A category. Out of the 292 C-rated drugs, classified by Food and Drug, 1981 to 1988, how many of the C category drugs ultimately moved into the A category? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, Mr. Chairman, they don't really move into the A category. The 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C designation is given at the beginning of the review process at FDA, and it controls the pace of that review process. For example, AIDS now is 1 double A, so it's faster than anything else. Once the drug is approved, the proof of the pudding here is in the eating, and the fact that Zantac, which is a H2 anti-ulcer drug, moved in the world medical system to number one, that was the real test. So it's not so much the movement-there is no movement in FDA. It's the fact that ACE Inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers, Zantac, all these drugs are clearly recognized by the medical system as being very, very signif- icant breakthroughs. Now, FDA doesn't go back and recalibrate. After a drug is approved, they don't go back and say, \"Well we should have made that ACE Inhibitor a 1-A.\" The CHAIRMAN. Well, I'm going to come back to that, but I'm going to do one final question. How do you explain an 88 percent rise in drug price inflation versus the 28 percent general price inflation since 1981? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Mr. Chairman, in my statement I point out several of the factors that have to do with that. One of the key fac- Committee staff note: In fact, \"ACE inhibitors\" are not used to obviate heart bypass surgery, according to Thomas Graboys, M.D., of Harvard University, one of the foremost experts on med- ical management as an alternative to heart bypass surgery.155 tors is the fact that the market for brand name drugs virtually col-lapses, after the expiration of the patent, because of the Drug PriceCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. Beginningin 1984, our companies lost a major market share of the brandname drug to the generics. That's one of the forces. The delays atFDA in approving new drugs is another force. And the fact is thatAct, which was passed by Congress in 1984, before I was at PMA, islike a two-act play. The first part of it, the economic effects of ge-neric competition, are being felt. The second half, which is patent-term restoration, is only now beginning to be felt. Only 5 of the 61patents on which the terms have been extended would be offpatent at this point. The CHAIRMAN. Later on I'm going to show you a graph 8 that Ihope is correct that shows that when a patent expires after 17years and a generic or generics come on the market in competitionthat the patented drug, the formerly patented drug, the brandname drug, still rises in price commensurate with the 8, 9, or 10percent per year. Now, let's see. I don't know who is next. Senator Cohen, wouldyou like to-- Senator COHEN. Well, just to follow up on that point, I mean,how extensive is the use of generics, Mr. Mossinghoff?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. As I understand the last survey, about 40 per-cent of the prescriptions filled in the United States are filled withgeneric drugs. Senator COHEN. Well, how do you account for the Chairman'schart which will be forthcoming, that shows that continued rise inthe costs of the patented drug even after the patent has expiredcompared to this penetration? I think you said, just repeated yourstatement that the market for brand name drugs collapses once thepatent has expired. If that's the case, how would you have a pat-ented drug, or prescription drug, nongeneric, continue to rise onthe marketplace? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, the volume of the market drops, rela-tively. The numbers I've seen are 50 percent in the first 2 yearsthat a product is off patent. The pricing strategies, Senator, I reallyhave to stay away from. PMA does not get involved. I'm sure thereare companies that reduce the price after the patent expires, andobviously, there is no question there are companies that raise theprice. But PMA cannot, does not, get involved in that strategy.Senator COHEN. If they raise prices would that indicate there'sstill a market for it? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, I think there's still a market, but thevolume of the market drops significantly for most brand namedrugs after the patent expires.Senator COHEN. Would that mean that the price increase, then,is designed to compensate for the drop in the volume?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I could only speculate, since we don't get in-volved, that that's part of the pricing strategy of our individualcompanies. ' See appendix 1, p. 345.156 Senator COHEN. Do your member companies themselves manu- facture and sell generic drugs? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Yes, they do. Senator COHEN. And what sort of bottom line do they have as far as a component of your member companies' operation-how big a component is it of those companies? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't know that answer, Senator. I don't know if PMA has that breakout or not. I think that a round number is that PMA companies probably supply about half of the generics sold in the United States, if that's helpful to you. I will attempt to get the other for the record, but I don't know the answer. [Subsequent to the hearing, the following information was re- ceived for the record:] Question. What percentage of the generic market is held by PMA companies? Answer. To determine the share of the mulitiple-source market held by PMA com- panies, PMA compiled market-research data from IMS America on the top 26 multi- ple-source products. PMA restricted its analysis to those products and dosage forms for.which FDA has judged generic competitors as bioequivalent. For two of the origi- nal 26 multiple-source products, there are no bioequivalent versions currently ap- proved for marketing. Based on the remaining 24 drugs, PMA estimates that PMA members, including the originator of the brand version, account for about 60 percent of both the pre- scriptions and the units (tablets or capsules) for these drugs. The originator brand alone represents about 50 percent of the prescriptions and units. For the generic market-i.e., the portion of the market that does not include the originator brand- PMA members account for about 25 percent of both the prescriptions and units. Senator COHEN. That's all I have right now, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cohen. Senator Warner. Senator WARNER. Thank you for the offer to come in here and help today, because I do believe within your industry we can get these answers. The absence, perhaps, of some of your members today-I think you can speak .for them having had an opportunity to visit with you, and maybe at a subsequent hearing they can come in and individually, after we frame the bigger picture, con- tribute their knowledge. I would hope that would be the case, be- cause right now there is this appearance that there is some goug- ing and that perhaps the member companies are hiding. But I don't think that's the case. Are they? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. They're not gouging, Mr. Chairman. Senator WARNER. Are they hiding? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. No, they're not hiding either. I really believe there was a genuine concern about discussion of proprietary infor- mation here. Senator WARNER. This chart, you saw the flat, basic return to the druggists, whereas the prices have gone up. Is there a reason for that? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, the price increase, as I indicated, has to do with a number of factors. The time during which the product life cycle exists, the United States has chosen as a policy to use ge- neric substitution as a cost-control mechanism. That decision was made in 1984. Most of the European countries do not permit phar- macists to substitute generic products. They've chosen other ways. France has a very tight price regulation. The United Kingdom con-157 trols profits in some way or another. So there is a mixed- bag ofhow one would control prices, and I would say that it's the forces,the delays in the FDA, plus the enormous R&D expenditure, andno one can deny that. Senator WARNER. Let me go to another one. In your preparedstatement you mentioned that the so-called average wholesale priceis, not really an accurate standard of what pharmacists actually-pay for -drugs. And this is what I was trying to get at. Why isn't it,and is there a better standard to use?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, the average wholesale price is not deter-mined by our companies. It's determined in part from surveys doneof our companies. It's also done by other surveys, as I think testi-mony today would indicate. The Inspector General of HHS did areport, and I believe it was in 1986, that showed that in general\"average wholesale price,\" the price published in the literature, isabout 16 percent higher than the price that pharmacists actuallypay for the products. In response to that while the Medicare billwas pending, PMA suggested that the Secretary of HHS do actualbi-annual surveys to determine what the real wholesale price is,.rather than relying on these published prices which are, I think ev-eryone agrees, higher than the actual price that pharmacists pay.Senator WARNER. You heard my questions to the previous panelabout .the marketplace and why the forces of competition aren'tbringing a stronger pressure to adjust these prices downward. Isthere a uniqueness to. this -market, different than, -say, other com-modities that our society has? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I think there is, Senator. It's a unique situa-tion. I think, among other things, the percentage of R&D is totallyunique in the United States and the amount of R&D--Senator WARNER. To the credit of the industry that they're put-ting in. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. That's right. And it is a highly competitivemarket. As an example, I cite Tagamet, which was the forerunner,and in fact the Nobel Prize was given to the discoverer of Tagamet,an anti-ulcer drug. You couldn't.tell the manufacturer that makesit that there's no competition, because Zantac, Pepcid, and Axidare all on the market and they're all anti-ulcer drugs. Now, it maybe that for a given patient your doctor would say that the Tagametis the right one, or Zantac is the right one, there are differences inthese, but it is an enormously competitive market, in many ways avery diffuse market, very unique.Senator WARNER-. My time is up, I see.The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Senator Kohl.By the way, I passed by Senator Kohl a moment ago and I apolo-gize. It was your turn, Senator Kohl.Senator KOHL. No problem. Mr. Mossinghoff, I'd just like to establish some of the profit andreturn on investment figures in your industry. According to my in-formation, your industry is running a rate of profit at around 14.5percent of sales, and about 29:5 -percent return on investment? Isthat somewhere close? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I have the Fortune magazine report which isas good as anything PMA has. That says that in terms of return on 31-352 0 -90 -6158 sales in 1988, it was 13.5, in terms of return on assets it was 13.1, in terms of return to stockholder's equity it was 23.6-- Senator KOHL. In 19 what? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. This is 1988. It was the one published, I guess, in the April issue-- Senator KOHL. Well, that's not much different from the numbers that I'm using. I would simply like to suggest that in American in- dustry those are very, very good numbers, unusually high, toward the highest, not very many industries do better. All of those state- ments you would agree with? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, on return to investors, which is really the key, we are 16th among American industries, well below tobac- co, toys, and other things. Senator KOHL. Sixteenth out of how many? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, this is 16th, absolutely. We're number 16 in terms of return to investors. Senator KOHL. Well, that's a pretty good number. I'm just sug- gesting that your industry does extremely well and it's not that they don't deserve to do well. I mean that's not where I'm-but we're certainly not in a situation here when we're talking about an industry that has so many problems, that are up against so many difficulties that they're in any danger for any reason of falling off a cliff and doing badly. They do extremely well. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well-- Senator KOHL. They are an investor's favorite. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, the low rank of ours on total return to shareholders is noted, obviously, on Wall Street. Being 16th, that's a very high-risk industry, I think as you would appreciate. Senator KOHL. Your price earnings, your PE ratio, which is an- other hallmark of investor interest, is very high. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Yes. Senator KOHL. Higher than tobacco companies. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't know that. I'll defer, obviously. Senator KOHL. Yes. Any comment on my question to the other panel about the cost of Nitro Dur all the way from 1 cent at the hospital level to $30 at the retail level? Is there any comment? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, Senator, I've heard the same. We really walk a wide ring around how our companies establish their pricing policy. We really have to as someone who receives their informa- tion on R&D and so on, we really have to keep a wide path be- tween us and pricing policies. The testimony this morning sounded reasonable to me, but I am in no way independently able to cor- roborate it. Namely, it seemed to me that one cent was in effect a donation to the hospitals. I mean, I think you'd agree with that just objectively. But I don't have a basis and can't have a basis for responding, and I'm sorry. Senator KOHL. I hope-my final observation-that one of the re- sults of these hearings is that both the industry and the Govern- ment and all parties concerned can find a way to have a win/win situation where everybody is reasonably well satisfied. And I'm sure that's a great concern of yours, and I mean that sincerely, that everybody is reasonably well satisfied that the correct forces are working in a proper manner, because otherwise unhappy159 things happen to everybody. And you don't want that, and certain-ly no other party wants that. And therexare, as you can tell, someconcerns about how the process is working.Mr. MOSSINGHOEF. I understand, Senator.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kohl.Senator Senator KASSEBAUM. Mr. Mossinghoff, I'd be curious what your'opinion is of why the pharmaceutical companies are not wishing toparticipate in the bidding out system that the. Kansas Medicaid istrying? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, I can answer part of that. And I don'twant to be oblique, but I really don't know. And PMA, as you un-derstand, cannot get involved in whether they do or don't. That'san individual corporate decision, and competitors can't decidewhether they're going to bid or not -on a given program, collective-ly. They have to make the decision independently. PMA worksvery hard to rule out formularies. And indeed, we were successfullast year in the pendency of the Catastrophic Act, to rule out for-mularies, which is generally recognized- as being second-class medi-cine. It means that if there are four drugs in a given category, andyour doctor`swants to give you Drug C, but Drug A is the only oneon the formulary, that's what you're going to get or you'll pay forit yourself. And we were delighted to be able to convince Congressthat a formulary is not :a good approach. I believe that in theKansas system, although- our -State people handle that, obviously,*more directly than I, they -do set up formularies. And we are insti-tutionally opposed to that-as being a way-to keep needed pharma-ceuticals, diverse pharmaceuticals, out of -the hands of the peoplethat need them. Senator KASSEBAUM. In the question of the marketplace, arethere any figures that show what percentage of the drugs are cov-ered- under third party providers? Do you know?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. apologize-there are numbers, andI would attempt to -provide those for the record and send them di-rectly-to -you, -but I can't answer that question this morning.ESubsequent to the- hearing, -the following information was re-ceived for the record:] Question. In the question of the marketplace, are there any figures that showwhat percentage of the drugs are covered under third-party providers?Answer. The most recent source-available for this data is the \"Report on 1987 Na-tional Health Expenditures\".prepared by the Health Care Financing Administra-tion..This report provides an estimate of outpatient.spending for drugs and medicalsundries as well as the percentage of this spending paid for by public and privatethird parties. According to the HCFA actuaries, about 61 percent of spending in thiscategory is attributable to prescription drugs.HCFA estimates that, in 1987, 25 percent of the total expenditures for drugs andmedical- sundries was paid for by third parties. Assuming that none of the non-pre-scription component of the drugs and medical sundries category is paid for by thirdparties, about 41 percent of- prescription expenses were paid by third parties. In1977, according to the National Medical Care Expenditures Survey, only 25 percentof prescription expenses were paid by third parties. Senator KAS5EBAUM. Thank you.Now, I'd like to ask you about the approach tried in Canada.Most of the highest priced drugs in the United States are thosethat are under patent protection-and I can fully understand and160 appreciate the need for that patent protection. In Canada, as I un- derstand it, there has been what is called a mandated licensing system, where the drug manufacturer is required to lease out to producers manufacturing the drug in return for royalties paid back to the developer. What is your assessment of such a system? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Senator, you're right. There used to be com- pulsory patent licensing in Canada. They enacted it in 1969. Last year they turned away from what we think was a very mistaken public policy and enacted what was called C-22. And that bill re- stored the rights of a patentee to a market share in lieu of this ex- tremely low 4 percent royalty. So that was done. We regard that in the pharmaceutical industry as an important first step to bringing their system into harmony with all the other developed countries' systems in the world. Senator KASSEBAUM. So the Canadian system really wasn't work- ing? Mr. MoSSINGHOFF. Not at all. The research was drastically cut. And we can provide this for the record, but I believe it's true that in the last decade Canada has not produced any new drugs, or at least any new chemical entities. The data I have indicate that they now plow back about 7 percent of sales in R&D, and it's their goal under this new legislation, C-22, to get to 10 percent by 1996. That's still significantly less than the 16 percent that we invest in the United States. And so, I think there was a recognition, and the reason they enacted C-22? was I think a self-serving recognition on their part, that they would have squeezed the industry so hard that the industry, in effect, was nonproductive. It couldn't exist under those circumstances. I think even though C-22, as I say, is not up to the standard of the United States, Germany, the UK, and the European Patent System, it's an important first step, and we hope to work with them to improve their intellectual property protection even more. [Subsequent to the hearing, the following information was re- ceived for the record:] Question. How many new chemical entities have originated in Canada in the last decade? Answer. According to the \"Drug Product Index\" (Vol. 1, 1988), published by Paul de Haen International, Inc., three new chemical entities have originated in Canada since that country adopted a system of compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical pat- ents in 1969. The new chemicals-all of which were developed by Merck Frosst Canada Inc.-and the year they were first marketed are: Blocadren (1973), Flexeril (1979) and Technetium TC-99 (1980). Senator KASSEBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kassebaum. Senator Cohen. Senator COHEN. I have one more question. Mr. Mossinghoff, the PMA lobbied very hard during the debate on catastrophic health care to prevent drug benefits from being in- cluded. And I might say that some of the tactics were resented by a number of members on the Hill because there were misrepresenta- tions made. But I was wondering about what the underlying philos- ophy behind it was. Was it the notion that once something is in- cluded as a benefit, it necessarily will follow that there will be an attempt to put limits on the costs?161 Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Senator, I really welcome that question. First,PMA did not lobby to keep the drug benefit out of the bill. We lob-bied against the House-passed bill. Our concerns today are aboutwhether the drug benefit, just the technology of the drug benefit,can come into play by January 1, 1991. The House-passed billwould have brought that benefit into effect 7 months ago. It wouldhave gone into effect at the first of this year. The House-passed billwould have been hopelessly underfunded, and that was the thrustof the PMA lobbying effort. And I would be happy to talk to yousometime at greater length about misrepresentations, because wehad a very high quality control, and I think that we can stand upto everything we said in the lobbying effort.But nevertheless, to set the record straight--Senator COHEN. Well, there-were letters coming from people whonever signed those letters, or agreed to sign letters that became thesubject of some controversy. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. And I understand there was a controversywith respect to your State, and I would apologize for that, the mis-understanding. But in any event, we did not lobby against the drugbenefit, we lobbied against the House-passed bill, which we thoughtwould have been hopelessly underfunded going in right from thestart, and even not implementable by the Federal Government. Weworked very hard with the Senate Finance Committee and, indeed,endorsed the drug portion. We took no position on the catastrophicportion. We endorsed the drug portion of the Senate-passed bill,and we worked even harder in the conference to make sure thatthe Senate principles, which we thought were very responsive andresponsible, found their way into the final Act, which they did.Senator COHEN. Does PMA support the continuation of the pre-scription drug coverage in the catastrophic health bill?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, we continue to support a financiallysound drug benefit in the Catastrophic Act.Now-- Senator COHEN. Do you think the bill as it is written today is fi-nancially sound? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well,4've read the most-recent-:reports and it casts serious doubts onr whetherthat is a financially sound bill. We haven't brought that to ourboard of directors, but.-PMA supports a financially sound, conserva-tive drug benefit in the Medicare bill.Senator COHEN. Thank you; Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cohen.Senator Heinz, who is the vice -chair of this committee, of course,has beef.-aalled to a markup of the Banking, S&L bill, I guess we'llcall it,-so we'll probably never see him again, period, ever. [Laugh-ter.] We'll just wave goodbye to John Heinz- But-first,- he. wanted forme to apologize to you, Mr. Messinghoff, and all the witnesses, and-to the committee, for not being able to be here. He's also expressedto me his concern about some of the things that we're talkingabout today. He wanted me to ask this question. This is SenatorHeinz' question: Like physicians, manufacturers are being calledon to take a hard look at their role in reducing rising health-carecosts. The physician community which is equally, if not more heter-162 ogeneous than manufacturers, has come to the table around pay- ment reform and the development of practice guidelines. Question: If a hearing such as this is not the forum for an exchange of ideas, what other forum is there, and what areas of drug reimbursement and pricing might we find some middle ground? That's Senator Heinz' question. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, I would think any of our CEO's would welcome the opportunity to meet confidentially and privately with the leadership of this committee to discuss their proprietary infor- mation, under appropriate confidential pledges. The materials that were asked of them go to the very heart of their marketing strate- gy. The answers are unknown to us at PMA, and indeed have to be unknown to us, and it's not one company. It's company A versus company B versus company C in a very, very competitive environ- ment. The board members of the PMA that I talked to about this hearing had a very genuine concern about a public hearing, and masking a drug, for example, masking Pfizer's anti-arthritis drug, wouldn't mask it from anyone. I don't care what you call it-Drug A or Drug B-the market is very well understood by each of our companies, the entire market. So, I suspect that might be something that would be appropriate. Another concern is that it's an extremely complicated, in effect, delicately balanced industry, the R&D expenditures and all the rest. And I think they'd welcome you or any other Committee member to their place and actually witness what goes into the de- velopment of a new drug. The CHAIRMAN. If I saw it, I'm not sure I would know what I was seeing. I appreciate that, Mr. Mossinghoff. Now, you talk about confidentiality and pricing mechanisms, and that the companies did not want to talk about prices, and they'd meet in confidence, et cetera. In the U.S. Government, in the De- partment of Commerce, Food and Drug Administration, anywhere else, do your members have to file the pricing mechanisms and the prices of the drugs they produce? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Not to my knowledge, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. What about Canada? Does the Canadian Govern- ment require this? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Under this C-22 legislation, there is a require- ment that price comparisons with other countries be submitted to-- The CHAIRMAN. Would you object if we had a similar regulation or law on our books in this country to require this type of informa- tion? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I really don't know how to answer that. I haven't brought that to the board. I don't think we would be anx- ious to see the Government getting itself involved in the free market. One of the hallmarks of the Medicare legislation was that you would rely upon the market to provide the checks and bal- ances. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Mossinghoff, the situation is this, the Gov- ernment is one of the major customers that your industry has. Fur- thermore, the Government, Medicare, is paying some of the highest prices of anyone, much higher than, for example, hospitals are paying, in fact sometimes several times more. We know nothing163 about the comparative prices. You refuse and your members refuse-to comre here to tell us how these price mechanisms work. How elseare we to find out about it? Mr. ..MOSSINGHOFF.; Mr. Chairman, -my first recommendationwould be to- discuss it in some -confidential forum with the peopleinvolved, sand in sufficient length so that an appreciation could begotten, not under a 5-minute rule, because I would submit thatthere's no way the complicated forces could be explained in any in-telligible way in 5 minutes, or even in a hearing in a morning.The CHAIRMAN. Well, as more and more Senators leave, we'regoing to expand that rule from 5 minutes, or 3 minutes, a little-fur-ther. Senator Warner. Senator WARNER. Well, let me just pick up on that. That's theunique way for us to conduct business, but I certainly, for one, amwilling to explore the opportunity. How would you suggest, do wejust sit in an informal-is this to protect the proprietary interests,or-- Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I really believe the protection that-as youcharacterize it, the confidential forum would give-this one doesnot-- Senator WARNER. Other than maybe the short, brief 5-minuterule, or something? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I think protection of confidentiality. Some ofthe questions asked by the Chairman go right to the heart of com-petitive pricing strategies. It's the most delicate of proprietary in-formation. And in an open forum-there was a proposal, I thinkmade in good faith by the committee and its staff, to mask drugs,instead of calling them by their names, calling them Drug A orDrug B. I would submit that it would take someone from a market-ing staff about 30 milliseconds to know what drug you're talkingabout, and what the information concerns.Senator WARNER. Well, now let's explore a little bit more. Howwould you like to go about it? And I certainly will entertain it. Andperhaps other members of the committee likewise will do it.Mr. MOSSINGHOFP. Well, I'm really not--Senator WARNER. Let's just structure. What sort of a meetingand how would you like to go about it?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. The first thing I'd like to do, maybe, is discussit with my executive committee, because I think I'm getting wayout ahead of the board of directors. The second thing, I would submit thAt I don't think any of ourboard members would be reluctant to come individually and talk atsome length to the Committee in an executive session. However, Ican't commit for the board, because it's obviously not somethingthat the board has considered. Senator WARNER. But I think it's important that we try and ex-plore it together because, as I said in my brief opening statement,the problem is clear. The segment of the society least able to pay isburdened with these high costs. While it may well be clear, we'researching to try and find the answer. And I think that this indus-try, which is a very responsible industry, could help us in thatsearch. And I, for one, say that if it's a confidential forum infor-164 mally that can crack this problem, let's take a look at it. And I will explore it. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I will specifically bring it to our executive committee. Senator WARNER. And would you come back to me? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I'll attempt to answer the question and come back to you, Senator. Senator WARNER. Would you come back to me, or other members of the committee, whatever the case may be, the Chairman or oth- erwise? I expressed to you a willingness to sit down in a confiden- tial forum and try and see what we can do to-- Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I appreciate that very much and I think our board would appreciate that. Senator WARNER. We'll do that. Senator Cohen, my time is out. Did you want to follow on? Senator COHEN. One question. The importance of doing this, Mr. Mossinghoff, the chest pain drug, Transderm Nitroglycerin, that's available-my understand- ing is that it is available to hospitals for 1 cent per unit, even though at a pharmacy it costs some $32 per unit. Now, this rather, I would say, drastic discount not only gets physicians and interns used to using this particular drug, but more importantly it intro- duces patients to this particular drug. Now, is that a marketing strategy? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Again, I would say-and both my common sense and my knowledge of the industry tell me-yes. I know that because our marketing people have told me that. But it sounds to me like it's not really a 1-cent sale, but that the companies are giving it to the hospital free, is the way I would characterize it. And that makes sense to me, but I really am not in a position to answer whether that's their marketing strategy or not, because they really don't get into that in PMA. That's an area of taboo for our trade association of competitors. Senator COHEN. Well, I think that example is probably a good reason why Senator Warner's suggestion is imperative that we sit down as soon as possible to try and explore some of these questions. Senator WARNER. Thank you. The CHAIRMAN. How many manufacturers of pharmaceuticals do you have in the PMA, Mr. Mossinghoff? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well over 100, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. Well over 100 companies. Now, what I under- stand with discussions we've had with some of those companies, and also the responses to our invitations for them to come was that they evidently-and maybe I'm reading between the lines; tell me if I m wrong-they think the Government ought to keep hands off. Is that what they think? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I wouldn't characterize it that way at all, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. How would you characterize it? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I-would say that a hallmark of the legislation which PMA supported in the Senate and which we supported after it came out of conference was that you would rely on marketplace systems to deliver these drugs. This is not a single depot. You don't just deliver the drugs, you use the whole system. There are two165 parts to the VA system. The non-depot part of that system com-pletely cuts out the pharmacists-the local pharmacist is not at allinvolved. The shipments go directly from the manufacturer to theVA under a negotiated schedule. That's a Government procure-ment system. The hallmark of the Medicare legislation was thatyou would rely upon the free-market forces, and, in fact, includedin the legislation is the fact that discounts of pharmacists, thosethat are able to get discounts, should not be considered in decidingthe reimbursement. The CHAIRMAN. All right, Mr. Mossinghoff.Our Government has, in fact, relied on the marketplace systemor the free market system since 1981. We have seen an 88 percentincrease in drug prices. How do we explain that to our constitu-ents? I come from a State, for example, that has an over 65 elderlypopulation percentage, ranked fifth in the United States. How do Igo back home and tell them that I'm looking after their interestswhen your organization says hands off the marketplace, free enter-prise, and I point to that chart and say, look, your drugs have in-creased 88 percent? And for you to exist, for you to live, you'regoing to be paying 88 percent more than you paid in 1981, andprofits of the companies are at an all time high? How do I explainthat? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, I would start by explaining it, and Iwish I had brought some charts-I wish I had brought some of thefigures from my statement. But I'd start by explaining to themthat from 1965 to the present, the expenditure for pharmaceuticalshave drastically sloped down from over 12 to about 6.8 percent oftotal health-care expenditure. You've got to look at the wholehealth-care system. If you spent a lot of money on an ACE Inhibi-tor or a Calcium Channel Blocker, and that keeps your constituentout of the hospital for a $40,000 by-pass operation, that's moneywell spent. And I would explain also that drugs today are cheaper,they cost less than they did in 1967, when the 1967 Consumer PriceIndex was set at 100. The numbers are that if from 1967 until nowwere under a 1967 standard, would be about 370, we'd be about 350and the-rest of health care would -be 520 plus. And so there are alot of very good explanations for this most cost-effective slice of thehealth-care dollar. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Warner, Senator Cohen, I apologize. I'mgoing to extend this a little bit, and then we'll have some exten-sions on both sides. Now you say that drug prices have gone down?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I'm saying that drug prices today are cheaperthan they were in 1967. The CHAIRMAN. For the same drugs?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. For the same basket of drugs.The CHAIRMAN. What do you mean, basket?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, it's the Bureau of Labor\"Statistics' con-structs for these individual industries, where you take a represent-ative basket -of something, whether it's drugs or tires, or automo-tive parts,, or whatever it is. That basket of drugs, in 1988, had anindex based on. 1967 of 350. For all other items, the normal infla-tion is at 370, and health care is at about 525. And there's no ques-tion that there has been inflation-that's one way to say it. And I166 can understand why the Committee would want to do that, but there are other ways to say it, too. We're a declining share of the health-care dollar, and we save money. We're not the problem in the overall health-care problem. We're the answer. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Mossinghoff, I've asked what you would tell your constituents if you were a Senator and you lived in a State with a major elderly population. If you were standing behind the drug counter, and you were a druggist, and each month, almost, or every 2 or 3 months, when the same people that you know and sing in the choir with and have raised your children with, et cetera, come in and you say, oh, I'm so sorry, your drugs have gone up again-and they do, between 8 and 11 percent a year-if you were a druggist out there in Camden, AR, what would you tell those cus- tomers of yours? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I think I'd attempt to tell them what I just said to you. But I'm not sure they'd be terribly persuaded, because that person has one thing on his mind. There already is a drug in existence thanks to us, that's why he's at the counter. There's a drug in existence and he'd like to get that drug for nothing if he could. He'd like you to pay him to take it, but he has to pay some- thing for it, so it s a very difficult situation. I don't deny that at all. But there is an overall socio-economic viewpoint that we think the Senate and the House had when they passed the Catastrophic Act, and that is to rely on marketplace forces. The CHAIRMAN. We're not talking right now about the Cata- strophic Act, Mr. Mossinghoff. We're talking about everyday USA out there, all across this country, and they've seen an 88 percent increase in drug prices and they're wondering why and they're wondering who is responsible. Now they're really not only wondering, they're worrying, are they going to be able to afford these drugs to keep them alive. It's really that basic. Now, remember, you're talking about the market basket of 350 drugs. These folks that come into your drugstore, Mr. Mossinghoff, they don't want to buy a basket of drugs. They don't know what a market basket is. They don't know what the GNP is. They don't know what's happened since 1968. They're worried about right now. And we can't explain nor can we justify these huge, enormous increases in prices, at the same time in profits, at the same time in tax subsidies by the American taxpayer, because all of these things that our Government is now giving to the manufacturers is not being passed on to the consumer, or to our Government. Senator Warner. Senator WARNER. Well, we certainly want to assure that person that he's getting the best quality to be found anywhere in the world, isn't that correct? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. It is correct. And the fact is that we're de- lighted that he could be at the counter, because that's the place-- Senator WARNER [continuing]. Or a lot of them wouldn't be there were it not for the advancements that your industry has made in the drugs?167 Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. That's exactly right. This committee, I guess,probably knows more than any single institution in the UnitedStates about the aging of America. But most of that aging, or avery high share of that aging, is because the magic medicines thatare developed by our companies have succeeded in treating theacute illnesses that otherwise cause people not to age.Senator WARNER. But the Chairman has a legitimate question,and you have offered to help get us the answer.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Yes. Senator WARNER. Thank you.The CHAIRMAN. By the way I've just been informed by the U.S.Capitol Police-to show this is an issue that has touched a nerve ora pocket book, or something-the U.S. Capitol Police said therewere 500 people waiting in the Russell Building in another roomwaiting to get into this hearing. So, at any rate, there's a lot of in-terest in it. Now, we mentioned a moment ago-in a moment I'm going toask you about page 7 of your testimony-I have sent to you, orgiven to your associates. I think, Mr. Mossinghoff, this chart. Andthis chart indicates when a patent expires on a drug, say you'vehad it for 17 years and.the patent expires on Brand X, we wouldnormally think that the marketing forces, the free enterprisesystem that you've talked about, that we would see the price ofBrand X drug go do'n when there was competition by the gener-ics. This chart does not indicate that. This chart indicates that theprice of Brand X, which is a brand drug, keeps going up. Why isthis? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Mr. Chairman--The CHAIRMAN. R&D is out, you've had your patent for 17 years,you've made a lot of dough. on that particular drug, and the pricestill goes up. Why? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, we don't come anywhere near 17 years-of protection on the patent.The CHAIRMAN. Well, say 10 years.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't know what drug it is, and indeed as Iresponded to Senator Cohen, we cannot, PMA cannot, get involvedin how our companies price. This says it's a typical drug, and Iassume it's a drug. I assume you could find other drugs where theprice goes down. But again, that's not something PMA would in-volve itself in. I assume it's one drug.The CHAIRMAN. Well, this is done by the Aging Committee, ourstaff, so I know it's accurate or they wouldn't have done it. Maybewe can come back to that in just a moment.Let's talk about taxes. Let's talk about page 7. And if you wouldlike to review that page a moment. I'd like to ask you why, in yourstatement, you would have this committee believe that the basictaxes of the drug manufacturing industry have increased? Wheredo you substantiate that? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, but are you sayingthe \"costs of labor, material, taxes and promotion have also in-creased?\" [Subsequent to the hearing, the following information was re-ceived:]168 Question. \"I'd like to ask you why, in your Statement, you would have this Com- mittee believe that the basic taxes of the drug manufacturing industry have in- creased? Where do you substantiate that?\" Answer. The U.S. Bureau of the Census collects financial data for manufacturing corporations and publishes these data for individual industries in the Quarterly Fi- nancial Reports (QFR). The data are published in the form of income statements and balance sheets. One of the data elements collected is \"Provision for Current and Deferred Domestic Income Taxes.\" The table below summarizes the tax data for the pharmaceutical industry pub- lished by the Census Bureau for 1981 through 1988. Because these data are collected through a statistical survey methodology, they are subject to some sampling varia- tion. Thus, small differences in annual totals may not be meaningful. The data from 1981 through 1988, however, show an 86 percent increase in taxes for the industry. Provision for Current and Deferred Domestic Income Taxes for the Pharmaceutical Industry [In millions of dollars] Year: Taxes 81 .$1,196 1982 .:........ 1,296 1983 .1,680 1984 .1,782 1985 1 655 1986. 2,351 1987 .2,280 1988 .2,229 The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I'm trying to think where that came from. I did not do a lot of work -on the taxes side in preparation for this statement. And if I misled the committee, I apologize for that. The CHAIRMAN. I don't want to accuse you of misleading anyone. I've known you a long time and we've been personal friends, and we're going to be. We're not on the same side on this issue-- Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. If I may, let me respond to that question for the record. The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. And with great apology if it turns out not to be the case. The CHAIRMAN. Absolutely. I would like to have you take note of the Tax Analysts Organization of Arlington, VA: \"Found that over the period of 1984 to 1987 the effective tax rate of the pharmaceuti- cal manufacturers has declined 27 percent.\" Now, in your advertising-and I'm not accusing you of mislead- ing-I must say that your advertisements disappoint me. And I've seen all five of them. I clip your ads. And I bring them into the office. Now, listen, talk to us about this. For example, you talk about FDA. You're accusing FDA of the long pipeline. One reason for the long pipeline in FDA-because this is what we've got to be honest about-one reason FDA takes so long is that your organiza- tions that you represent here today, the drug manufacturers are clogging the FDA pipeline with drugs that add nothing to existing therapies with C category drugs. We had a chart there just a moment ago, I wish you would put back up there now, David, show- ing how many C category drugs there are. You're clogging the- you've given the system high cholesterol. They can't do anything else except look at these C drugs, and they're not having an oppor- tunity to look at those drugs that relate to Alzheimer's disease, to169 AIDS, and all the rest, because you're clogging them with the prof-itable drugs. Is that right? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. That's not right, Mr. Chairman. For one, thestatement that the C drugs don't do anything for anyone is just notsupportable. The C drugs, as I've indicated, and we will provide in-formation for the record, the C drugs are determined-going intoFDA. And I don't see how you could say that the first CalciumChannel Blocker, which is state-of-the-art cardiovascular treatmentnow, or the first ACE Inhibitor, Zantac, which is the largest sellinganti-ulcer drug in the world, haven't done anything for anyone. Ireally believe that statement is not supportable.The CHAIRMAN. I'm going to need some of that ulcer medicineafter this hearing. I should say that.Now, let's talk about taxes just a moment.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Second, the numbers-we will talk to yourstaff about these numbers. I suspect they're all NDAs-new drugapplications. I don't know, maybe your staff could confirm thathere. The CHAIRMAN. I'm not sure. All I know is that the Food andDrug Administration is where we got the \"me-too\" factor.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. From 1981 to 1988, which is 7 years, therewere not 300 new chemical entities filed--The CHAIRMAN. That's 1981 to 1988--Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't know whether they are what's callednew chemical entities, or whether they're new drug applications.Those are very different. The CHAIRMAN. These are, I've been told, new drug applications.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Not new chemical entities.The CHAIRMAN. This is-or molecular entities--Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I think the numbers square with that. Now,what these are, Mr. Chairman, is if somebody has a dosage form,and they think there will be a more effective dosage form, or theycan lower-the dosage -form, or they can change some other aspect ofit, they still have to file a new drug application in order to do that.What that does is produce a greater variety for the physician tochoose a new dosage form-and that needs a new drug application.These are not me-too drugs. These are simply changes in thingswhich cannot be made without the approval of the Food and DrugAdministration. The CHAIRMAN. We may, Mr. Mossinghoff, come back to thatpoint momentarily. 'But, my next point is about the inference you would have usdraw, from the pharmaceutical manufacturers that a drug costs$125 million, to produce-the inference you would have us draw isthat the companies are paying for all of this, that this is right outof your pocket, and you are good citizens, and I don't question that.Now, I -want to ask you this question: Are you familiar with theresearch and, development -tax credit?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Yes, sir.The CHAIRMAN. Are you familiar with the area of the tax lawcalled expensing R&D costs? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Not really.The CHAIRMAN. Well, your companies are, I promise you. Whatabout R&D allocation?170 Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Not enough to respond. The CHAIRMAN. Your companies do. And what about the posses- sion tax credit? I think that's Section 936. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I am familiar with that. The CHAIRMAN. Puerto Rico. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I am familiar with that. The CHAIRMAN. Right. Now, those are four major areas. What are the States doing? Do they-don't respective States also grant some drug manufacturers the freedom from having their customers pay sales tax on items that they utilize and manufacture? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't know the answer to that. The CHAIRMAN. And isn't certain income tax breaks also in R&D on the State level? [Subsequent to the hearing, the following information was re- ceived for the record:] Question. Don't respective states also grant some drug manufacturers the freedom from paying sales tax on items that they utilize and manufacture? Answer. Most states exempt from sales tax the materials used in manufacturing a final product. The exemptions are the same for a pharmaceutical company as for any other manufacturer. We are unaware of any special exemption in any state that provides preferential tax treatment for drug companies over other manufactur- ers. Many states do exempt drugs from a sales tax. The exemption reflects a state public policy that it is socially desirable to exempt certain basic items-drugs, clothes, food-from the state sales tax for the benefit of consumers. Question. And aren't certain income tax breaks also in R&D on the state level? Answer. Many states mirror the federal tax code, and therefore provide research and development credits, accelerated depreciation and other such measures for cor- porations. We specifically surveyed the tax laws of California, Indiana, North Caro- lina and New Jersey-states where there are substantial pharmaceutical oper- ations-and found no preferential tax treatment for the pharamaceutical industry over other industries. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Again, I'm sure our tax committee can pro- vide an answer. I don't know the answer. The CHAIRMAN. You know where I'm headed. And that is that you're getting an awful lot of tax subsidies and tax breaks from the American taxpayer. So when you say it costs $125 million, really what you are doing, is you're doing what you're supposed to do. So I don't know why you brag about it. And I really don't think the drug manufacturers should brag about this. And I hope on your sixth ad, I think you've run five now-I keep up with them-on your sixth advertisement, I hope you might say also that we do get these tax breaks, folks, and hopefully if we can produce these drugs we can make a lot of them, and we'll pass the savings on to you. I wonder if your upcoming ad might do that. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. If this is a question, let me attempt to re- spond. And that is to say, I heard your opening statement, and I have no basis at all for disagreeing with your estimate of a billion dollars a year in so-called tax breaks, of one kind or another. The $7.3 billion that our companies will invest this year is a significant- ly higher amount than that. And so I would submit that if it is a $1 billion figure, and I thought that's what I heard you say-- The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF [continuing]. That we're comparing $1 billion to $7.3 billion, $6.3 billion if you discount the $1 billion, and that171 would still put us way ahead of all other high-technology industries-in the United States,. where the average investment in R&D is 3.4percent of sales. The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Now, how much did you say you were goingto invest, $7 billion? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. It's $7.3 billion this year.The CHAIRMAN. All right. Over the next 5 years, according to the Joint Committee on Tax-ation-I do not have this, and I hope I can document this momen-tarily-the Joint Committee on Taxation informs me that over thenext 5 years there will be an $11 billion tax break for drug manu-facturers. So you're going to come out ahead.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Over the next 5 years?The CHAIRMAN. Over the next 5 years, an $11 billion tax breakfor drug manufacturers for research and development.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. That's $7.3 this year. If you multiply that, andit's going up-it will double in 5 years. So it will be $14 billion in 5years. If you integrate 7 to 14, I think you come out somewherearound $60 billion that we'll invest as compared with whatevernumber you have, the $11 billion. You can't compare a 5-year taxbreak to a 1-year expenditure. I think we're ahead of the game byabout $50 billion that we're investing in new therapies.The CHAIRMAN. All right, sir. I don't want to push this point too much. I'm trying to maintainis that you get great inducement and incentive by our Governmentas a policy, and from the taxpayer of this country, in support ofyour research and development. I just hope you'll, give us a breakand tell people that that in fact is occurring.Now, one final area in this concern. We give an R&D tax breakfor research for a new drug. And that's probably as it should be.Ultimately, FDA, let's say, approves the drug. That again is a U.S.Government function. The U.S. Government then grants a patentto that particular company to produce that drug for 17 years. Forthe costs of researching it, a tax break; a Government subsidy.Then, FDA approves the medicine, and then we move the plant toPuerto Rico to manufacture it. And get another tax break.Now, how many of your members have plants that manufacturedrugs in Puerto Rico, and take advantage of section 936 of the taxlaw? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. It's over 20, Mr. Chairman, over 20 of thelargest-- The CHAIRMAN. It would be your major concerns.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't think the smaller companies have it.The CHAIRMAN. And do we know about how many employeesthat these companies have in Puerto Rico?Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. It's well over 100,000. I'd have to confirm thatfor the record, because I didn't know this was going to be a hearingon Section 936. The CHAIRMAN. Right. And the drugs manufactured there andthe profits resulting therefrom, there's no tax liability, this is cor-rect? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I'm not sure it's no tax liability. It's reducedtax liability, I believe. Again, we can provide this information, and172 I'm sure your staff-can provide it. I don't believe it's no tax liabil- ity. [Subsequent to the hearing, the following information was re- ceived for the record:] Question. And do we know about how many employees that these companies have in Puerto Rico? Answer. A 1987 study of Section 936 and Economic Development in Puerto Rico by Robert R. Nathan Associates, Inc. found that Section 936 companies employ 100,000 people and that an additional 175,000 people work for those who provide goods and services to Section 936 firms, for a total of 275,000 direct and indirect jobs. In addition, the Nathan study found that almost 62,000 jobs are directly and indirectly attributable to the pharmaceutical industry. The jobs created by the pharmaceutical industry in Puerto Rico are primarily skilled jobs, for which the industry provides training and employee and family bene- fits. The pharmaceutical industry pays the highest average wages ($21,823 in 1983) among all Section 936 manufacturing industries. The growth in Section 936 jobs has more than offset the significant decline in non- 936 jobs in Puerto Rico, most of which are in labor-intensive industries. More than one-third of Puerto Rico's total employment is accounted for by the manufacturing operations of possessions corporations. Without Section 936, there would be much higher unemployment in Puerto Rico-and increased federal transfer payments. Question. And the drugs manufactured there and the profits resulting therefrom, there's no tax liability? This is correct? Answer. That is not correct. Income earned in United States possessions, including Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, is subject to U.S. tax. Section 936 provides a credit, under speci- fied conditions, offsetting the U.S. tax on income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in U.S. possessions. The intent of Congress in providing this tax incentive, as noted by the Senate Fi- nance Committee as early as 1976, is to promote employment-producing investments by U.S. companies in Puerto Rico and other U.S. possessions. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, this objective was extended to include qualified Caribbean Basin coun- tries. Congress has determined that the possessions tax credit is necessary to spur investment in areas of vital national interest where the cost of doing business would otherwise be prohibitively high. Under carefully drawn regulations implementing the possessions credit, signifi- cant restrictions have been placed on the amount of active business or passive in- vestment income that is eligible for the credit. In addition, Puerto Rico imposes a tollgate tax on possessions corporations earnings that are repatriated to parent com- panies on the U.S. mainland. Changes in Section 936 under the tax laws of 1982 and 1986 imposed additional restrictions on the amount of possessions-source income.eli- gible for the credit. The CHAIRMAN. Let's go back to our original chart; 88 percent in- crease in the cost of drugs, 28 percent in the inflation record. We've given all these tax breaks, you're going to Puerto Rico to manufacture the drugs. We've given you a patent, FDA approves, et cetera. What's the taxpayer getting out of all this? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. The taxpayer is getting an enormous saving in the rest of the health-care dollar because.of the fact that we have, with all those intracorporate factors and forces, cut our share of the health-care dollar in half. The taxpayer is getting a better buy in 1988 on the basket full of drugs than he did in 1967. The CHAIRMAN. I can't convince my constituents of that back home. Senator Cohen is much sm-arterthai I am, and maybe he can. Senator Cohen. Senator COHEN. If I could come back to an issue raised by Sena- tor Warner. He's attempted to highlight the ways in which market economies pertain to prescription drugs, that they're unique. But perhaps you could give us a little lesson here in terms of how this173 works. As I understand it, when we're talking about free marketeconomy we have an arms length transaction, we have a skilledseller, and an informed or perhaps even gullible buyer, but a ready,willing and able buyer. That's how we normally define the freemarketplace. But in this particular case we have someone otherthan the consumer who drives demand. And I would say the doc-tors and the hospitals in this particular case. You have somebodyother than the consumer who s paying the bill. And that's Medi-care, an insurance company, third party intermediaries.And another point that strikes me as being somewhat ironic isthat repeatedly you ask us to leave this to the free market system,and yet there appears to be some operations of monopoly powerhere, or monopoly pricing, whether the VA gets one price, or theGovernment gets another price, a hospital gets it for 1 cent, thepharmacy gets it for $32. I don't understand how you're talkingabout a free market economy in this situation where you don'tseem to have that ready, willing, and able buyer, but in fact youhave something other than the consumer driving this, or peopleother than the consumer making the decision. They're not in-formed. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Senator, it's true that the marketing in thepharmaceutical industry is unique because there is a learned inter-mediary. As soon as drugs are safe and effective enough for self-medication, the companies, and typically our companies, will movethem from prescription status to over-the-counter status. Butduring the time that'a determination can't be made, or they're apotent medicine that needs to be monitored closely by a physician,it's the physician who makes the selection. And that's the way itworks in this country. And it's a-I'd say again, very beneficial.I think the evidence of the market economy is that in the Medi-care Act itself, Congress set up the baseline period-1981 to 1986 isthe standard of comparison-that the Prescription Drug PaymentReview Commission looks at and the Secretary of HHS looks at.That period shows about a 10.2 percent increase in prices. In 1988,it's gone down to about 7.8. Now, that was the whole idea behindthe 1984 Act-market economy. Then generics come onto marketas soon as the patent expires, and that's not 17 years, I guaranteeyou. In fact, under the Act, it can't be more than 14 years. And atthat point that was the cost-control measure adopted by Congress.It's significant, I think, that in those European countries whichhave a totally different system with regulated numbers of pharma-cies, or even Government-owned pharmacies, those systems havenot chosen to use generic incentives as a price control. They usedirect market price controls, which is typical of some Europeancountries. So I think there is a market working here. Clearly, inthe case of the breakthrough drug, Tagamet, it's now got heftycompetitors in Zantac, Axid, and Pepcid. Now, that is a marketeconomy well at work. I think the industry itself is sort of a free-enterprise, liberaleconomist's dream. It's highly competitive with nobody controllingmore than 8 percent of the market. Twenty-two companies wouldhave to be put together to reach 75 percent of the market. The in-dustry has a positive trade balance. It does all of its R&D, albeit wethink with some appropriate incentives from the taxing side. i174 produces the most cost-effective form of therapy, and it is a declin- ing share of the health-care dollar. I think the market's the place. I think the fact that in 1988, if you can say to-your constituents that drugs, the basket full of drugs. costless now than it did in 1967, if that's not free-market forces at work, I don't know how you would define free-market forces. Senator COHEN. But I do know that PMA is usually in lobbying for more protection rather than less, as far as patents are con- cerned. You didn't ask for a lower period of time, but a greater period of time. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. That's exactly right. I mean, we work around the world for intellectual property protection. Senator. COHEN. Is that free market, or is that monopolistic? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I have a bias because I'm a former patent commissioner during 1981 and 1985. But I think patents are the ab- solute essence of free market. You spend your own money. You take nothing away from the market that was there. What you do is add something to the market, and in return for your enormous ex- penditure, the $125 million, you get a patent on the thing you brought to the market. It takes nothing away from the market. On the new thing you brought to the market, you use the patent as your incentive to do free-enterprise investment. It's the essence of the free-market system. Senator COHEN. Did you want to stick with that $125 million figure? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Very definitely. Senator COHEN. So, without responding to the question about the .tax credits, the expensing of R&D-- Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. Well, I think that is based on our R&D ex- penditures. It was a study done by Professor Wiggins of Texas -A&M. Another study was done, an earlier study by Professor Hansen. There's yet a third study by Professor Grabowski at Duke University who said it's $132 million. While we can't prove that it's $125 million versus $132 million, all the studies fall in exactly that range. Now we could, I think, calculate. An economist could find out what the tax situation was and find out how much of that $125 million is the R&D tax credit. Senator COHEN. I just have a conceptual problem in dealing with a situation in which demand is being driven by those who pay very little for a drug. Where you create a demand by giving it away to a hospital, or giving it away to an attending physician, and then when it gets out into the marketplace the price goes up 30 times. Now, that to me-we see that illegally taking place on the streets of Washington, DC, and we see it as a criminal act. That's how they get people hooked, low price and then jack the price up once people become addicted to that particular drug. And it just seems to me-I'm not suggesting this, but in this particular case, demand is being driven by people who don't bear the cost. They're not the ones. They're being passed on down the line to people who have no idea what's involved. And I don't think that necessarily is a free market economy that we're talking about. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I'm not sure they have no idea what's in- volved.175 Senator COHEN. They have an idea when they have to pay thebill, but they don't understand why.Mr. MOSSINGH6FF. But I think that-Senator COHEN. We don't even understand why.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. One of the advantages of a policymaker-andI would sympathize with the person standing at the counter in Ar-kansas, because that person is not charged with policy-is youstand back and look at that system. Drugs cost less now than theydid in 1967, and they produce marvelous recovery. You know, theaging of America is really due in large part to what has been re-ferred to as enchanted substances, that our companies make.They're not the problem. They're a declining share of the health-care dollar, and they're the most cost-effective share. So I think aspolicymakers, you'd stand back and look at the whole health caresystem. Senator COHEN. The ball's back to you, Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN. Many of the companies that comprise your asso-ciation, Mr. Mossinghoff, have submitted, I believe, five or six let-ters this morning, back to Kansas where they said they would notnegotiate, nor do business with these buying groups that are at-tempting to get a better price for the consumer back in the State ofKansas. Have any of these companies, to the best of your knowl-edge, consulted an attorney to ask if this refusal is a violation ofthe Robinson-Patman Act? Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. I don't know the answer to that.The CHAIRMAN. I don't know either. But I think it's a questionthat ought to be asked. Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. In a general comment, that act was a Depres-sion Era act, together with the nonprofit institution exception orexemption to it. That's been litigated, I believe, four or five times.And I mentioned the major cases in a footnote to my statement.The last one, I believe, was in 1984. So apparently the act itself,since it gives private parties, aggrieved parties, a private cause ofaction, and since unfortunately in the United States no one is terri-bly reluctant to sue their neighbor, I would submit that the act andits exemption are probably pretty well understood by the industry.Those were four cases directly involved in the pharmaceutical in-dustry. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Mossinghoff, I would just conclude with aparagraph or so. I don't know what the outcome of this hearingwill be. I know we're going to have another one. And I certainlydon't know what the Senate or the House will do. I have no idea. Idon't know in what year we'll do it. But I can say one thing. Thissystem, this legislative system that we have, and you know it verywell, as well as anyone in this town, we very seldom act, we react.And if that red line keeps going up at that rate, and Senator Pryor,and Senator Cohen, and all of us can't go back there and explainthis to our constituents, and if that druggist cannot explain this tohis or her customers, I don't know when it will happen, but some-thing is going to happen. Something's going to give.I want to thank you for your testimony.Mr. MOSSINGHOFF. And thank you for permitting me to be here.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.176 We'll call our next panel now. That's Mr. Joseph Thomas III, Ph.D., of Purdue University School of Pharmacy, and Mr. Bruce Laughrey, President* of~ Medi-Span. Inc., Indianapolis, IN. Gentle- men, we appreciate your patience. You've been long suffering sit- ting here in this meeting. It's been a warm and crowded room all day. And we look forward to your statement. We will try to consist of no more than five minutes each. We'd appreciate your staying within that time frame, and then I'll have a few questions. Dr. Thomas, you may begin. STATEMENT OF JOSEPH THOMAS III, PH.D., OF PURDUE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, WEST LAFAYETTE, IN Mr. THOMAS. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments this afternoon. Although drug expenditures represent less than 7 percent of total health care expenditures, the expenditures made on prescrip- tion drugs have come under increasing scrutiny since drug price in- creases began outpacing general price increases during the 1980s. However, community pharmacies have not benefited from in- creases in prescription drug prices. Instead, increases in prescrip- tion drug prices and heavy competition have decreased pharmacy owners' financial returns. Some pharmacies' very survival is in doubt as they are caught between the squeeze of increasing product costs, intense competi- tion, and restricted third party reimbursement rates. If you look at the table to your far left, Senator, you can clearly see that in- creased pharmacy profits have not been the driving force behind prescription.price increases. The average price of a prescription dis- pensed in retail pharmacies increased from $3.35 in 1965 to $4.64 in 1975. Between 1975 and 198.7.the average retail prescription price tripled to over $15. However, independent pharmacies' net profit before taxes on sales declined from 5.8 percent in 1965 to only 3.3 percent in 1987. * The data clearly show that independent-pharmacies-have experi- -enced decreased profitability during this era of rapidly increasing ,prescription prices. Product costs, the amount that pharmacists spend to purchase drug products from manufacturers and Lwholesalers, represent the largest expense category inmcommunityipharmacies. In fact, prod- -uct costs increased from -63.8;percent .of independent pharmacy sales in 1965 to 67.4 percent in 1985. As a result, pharmacy gross margins have declined from more-than 36 percent of sales in 1970 to less than 33 percent in 1985. Gross margin represents the frac- tion of sales revenue left to pay operating costs, such as rent, heat, air conditioning, or employee wages, after product costs have been subtracted. A decline of.3 to 4 percent over a 10-year period might at first glance appear insubstantial. However, it is instructive to note that in 1987, independent pharmacies 'average net profit before taxes was only 3.3 percent based on Lilly Digest data. It is clear that pharmacies have not benefited from drug product price increases. Instead, prescription drug costs have become a financial burden to retail pharmacies.177 Reimbursement rates under Medicaid have been a contributingfactor in this cost-price squeeze. Medicaid covered 17.7 percent ofall retail prescriptions in 1987. However, prescriptions coveredunder Medicaid represented 21.4 percent of all prescriptions dis-pensed by independent pharmacies, as compared to only 10.4 per-cent of prescriptions dispensed by chain drug stores in 1987. The$14.39 average Medicaid prescription reimbursement in 1987 repre-sented a 13-percent increase over 1986. But more informative is thefact that the $11.07 average product cost in 1987 represented a19.6-percent increase from 1986. In contrast, the $3.32 averagepharmacist dispensing fee represented a 4.6-percent decrease from1986. The percentage of the average Medicaid prescription that re-mained after accounting for drug product costs to cover pharma-cies' operating expenses, or to contribute toward some return on apharmacy owner's investment, has decreased from 33.2 percent in1982 to 23.1 percent in 1987 under Medicaid. As stated earlier, over70 percent of Medicaid revenue in community pharmacies goes topay for drug product costs that pharmacists incur in purchasingproducts from drug wholesalers or manufacturers.Pharmacies have little control over product costs. Since pharma-cies have little control over their product costs, incremental restric-tions on reimbursement for retail pharmacists have not been andwill not be effective in controlling or reducing prescription drugprogram benefits. Efforts to contain costs such as initiatives to dis-count AWP in estimating product acquisition costs under Medicaidignore the fact that total pharmacy reimbursement consists of theproduct cost component and the pharmacy dispensing fee.If additional restrictions are placed on pharmacy reimbursement,some pharmacies will be forced out of business. In fact, pharmaciesthat tend to be located in areas with higher concentrations of Gov-ernment program beneficiaries, such as independent pharmacies,are likely to feel the greatest impact of such restrictions.In summary, since pharmacies have little control over drug prod-uct costs, restrictions on retail pharmacy reimbursement cannot beeffective in containing program costs. However, such restrictionspresent a very real threat to the survival of many pharmacies, andto program beneficiaries' access to pharmaceutical services.[The prepared statement of Mr. Thomas follows:]178 TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH THOMAS III, Ph.D. ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR PHARMACEUTICAL ECONOMICS RESEARCH CENTER SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, PURDUE UNIVERSITY fir. !Cairmman, my name is Joseph Thomas 111. I serve as associate director of the Pharmaceutical Economics Research Center, in the Purdue University School of Pharmacy. Introducti on Health expenditures have exhibited a long-term growth trend in terms of total dollars expended on health care and the percentage of the nation's g oss national Product (CNP) that has been consumed by health care expenditures. In 1970 annual health care expenditures totaled $75 billion and 7.4 percent of GNP. In 1987 total health expenditures were $500 billion and 11.1 percent of GNP (Figure 1). Total expenditures on drugs and medical sundries have also shown continuing increases since 1950. In 1950, such expenditures weve S1.7 billion. In 1970 drugs and medical sundry expenditures equalled $8.0 billion. By 1987 drug and medical sundry expenditures had risen to $32.8 billion. However. Expenditures on Drugs have accounted for a declining percentage of total health care expenditures over the past three decades. Drugs accounted for :3.6 percent of total health care expenditures in 1950, 10.7 percent in 1970. and only 6.3 percent in 1987 (Figure 2). Although drug expenditures represent less than 7 percent of total health care expenditures. the expenditures made on prescription d-ugs hate come under increasing scrutiny. Part of the reason behind the increased attention is the fact that prescription drug price increases began outpacing general price increases during the 1980's. Prior to the 1980's, prescription drug prices increased at a slower rate than increases in the consumer price index (CPI). However, during the 80's increases in the CPI for prescription drugs have outpaced general inflation as represented by the CPI for all items (Figure179 Phar cies have not Benefited fromPrescription Price Increases As a result of the rapid increases in prescription drug prices, pricing practices of all sectors involved with pharc.aceuticals, including community pharmacies. have cone under review. However, community pharmacies have not benefited from increases in prescription drug prices. Instead increases in prescription drug prices and heavy competition have decreased pharmacy owners' financial returns. Some pharmacies' very survival is in doubt as they are caught between the squeeze of increasing product costs, intense competition and restricted third party reimbursement rates. The average price of a prescription dispensed in retail pharmacies increased from S3.35 in 1965 to 54.64 in 1975. Between 1975 and 1988 the average retail prescription price almost tripled to over fifteen dollars. However, independent pharmacies' net profit before taxes on sales declined from 5.83 percent in 196; to only 3.20 percent in 1988 (Figure 4). .Clearly increased pharmacy profits have not been the driving force behind prescription price increases, Instead, the data clearly show that independent pharmacies have experienced decreased profitability during an era of rapidly increasing prescription pr-ices. Pharmacies Are in a Cost-Price Squeeze Product costs, the amount pharmacists spend to purchase drug product.from manufacturers and wholesalers, represents the largest expense category in community pharmacies. In fact, product costs increased from 63.8 percent of independent pharmacy sales in 1965 to 67.4 percent in 1985 (Figure 5). As a result, pharmacy gross margins, have declined from more than 36 percent of sales in 1570 to less than 32 percent in 1983 (Figure 6). Gross margin represents the fraction of sales revenue left to pay operating costs such as rent, heat, air coinditioning, telephone bills, or employees wages after product costs have be subtracted A decline of between 3 and 4 percent over a ten year period in pharmacy gross margins might a first glance appear insubstantial. However, it is instructive to note that independent pharmacies' average net profit before taxes was only 3.20 percent as reported in the LijlyJDijgest. Pharmacists have responded in part to increasing product costs and declining gross margins by attempting to reduce operating expenses. In fact, operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 23.3 percent in 1973 to 28.8 percent in 1987. Even though pharmacies have managed to reduce their operating expenses as product costs have increased they have not been able to maintain their profit margins. Independent pharmacies' net profit before taxes declined from 5.8 percent of sales in 1965 to 3.2 percent of sales in 1988 (Figure 4).180 In other words, pharmacies have been squeezed because product cost have been increasing when pharmacies have been restrained from increasing revenue. Due to the cost-price squeeze pharmacies have been forced to absorb some of the product cost increases in the form of reduced net profit. It is clear that pharmacies have not benefited from drug product price increases. Instead, increased prescription drug costs have become a financial burden to retail pharmacies. Impact of Government Programs Medicaid covered 17.7 percent of all retail prescriptions in 1987. However, prescriptions covered under tledicaid represented 21.4 percent of all prescriptions dispensed by independent pharmacies as compared to only 10.4 percent of prescriptions dispensed by chain drug stores in 19S7. The average prescription-reimbursement under medicaid in 1982 was $9.17 of ubhich S6.13 went -. cover product costs and S3.04 represented harriacists' fees. By 1937 the average prescription reimburseaent under medicaid was $14.39 of which S11.07 went to cover product cost but only $3.32 was for pharmacist fees (Figure 7). The $14.39 average Medicaid prescription reimbursevent in 1987 represented a 13 percent increase over 1986's $12.74. But more irifornative is the fact that the'S .07 average product cost in 1987 represented a 19.6 percent increase from S9.26 in 1986. In contrast, the $3.32 average pharmacist fee represented a 4.6 percent decrease from 1986. More or less static pharmacy fees under medicaid while pharmacies have been incurring increased product costs have resulted in declining gross margin on Medicaid prescriptions for community pharmacies. For example, in 1982 drug product costs represented 66.8 percent of the average Medicaid prescription reimbursement to pharmacies. In 1987 the proportion of the average Medicaid prescription reimbursement that iwent to pay prescription drug product costs had increased to 76.9 percent. In other words, the percentage of the average Medicaid prescription reimbursement that remained, after accounting for drug product costs, to cover pharmacies operating expenses or to contribute toward some return on a pharmacy owner's investment had decreased from 33.2 percent in 1982 to 23.1 percent in 1987 (Figure 8). Limiting Pharmacies' Reimbursement Will Not Control Benefit Program Expenditures As stated earlier, over 70 percent of each dollar of revenue in community pharmacies goes to pay for drug product costs that pharmacies incur in purchasing drug products from drug wholesalers or manufacturers. Pharmacies have very little control over drug product costs. The cost to retail181 phai.._zies for a gumcn product a..y csanre several times during the course of a year without prioi cotice. Since pharmacies hans little control over their drug product costs, incrt..,ental restrictions on reimbursements furI retail pharmacies have not been and will cot be effective in cuotrulliog cr reducing expenditures on prescription drug benefit piograns. Efforts to contain costs, such as initiatives to discount AWP in estimatiing product acquisition cost under Medicaid ignore the fact that total pharmacy reimbursement consists of both the product cost component and the pharmacy dispensing fee. Pharmacies' dispensing fees under Medicaid have experienced negligible increases over the past decade. In fact, Medicaid dispensing fees have actually decreased in real dollar terms over the past decade (figure 9). Even with additional restrictions on retail pharmacy reimbursement, program cost will continue to increase as pharmacies experience increased product cost over which they have little control. rHowever. such restriction will exacerbate the cost price squeeze faced by retail pharmacies. Some might suggest that any deficiencies in reimbursement under government programs can be made up through minor increases in charges to cash paying customers. However, as the proportion of retail pharmacy prescriptions covered under government programs increases, necessary additional charges to cash paying customers to make up for deficiencies in government reimbursement increases exponentially, not in proportion to increases in prescriptions covered under government programs. More importantly, competition in the retail phaimacy market will not permit pharmacies to pass such increases on to private third party programs or cash paying customers. Since differences exist across pharmacies in the proportion of their prescriptions cove.ed by government programs, the rec, ary ifincrrase is charges would vary across pharmacies. For example, on average the prcportion of prescriptions covered by Medicaid in independent pharmacies is twice as large as in chain pharmacies. Therefore Independent pharm;cies would have to charge much higher prices on all other prescriptions in ceder to maintain financial viability. However, each pharmacy is caught in a dilemma because consumers will choose to have their Prescriptions filled at pharmacies that offer lower prices. In reality, in the competitive retail pharmacy market, pharmacies can not make up deficiencies in reimbursement under government programs through higher charges to other customers.182 If additional restrictions are placed on pharmacy reimbursements some pharmacies will be forced out of-business. In fact, pharmacies that tend to be located in areas with higher concentrations of government program beneficiaries, such as independent pharmacies, are likely to feel the greatest impact of such restrictions. Therefore, such restrictions are likely to cause closures of some pharmacies, especially independent pharmacies that typify small business enterprise. Since the pharmacies most likely to close are those serving large number of government program beneficiaries such closures will also significantly reduce access to pharmaceutical services for such program beneficiaries. In summary, since pharmacies have little control over drug product costs, restrictions on retail pharmacy reimbursement can not be effective in containing program costs. However, such restrictions present a very real threat to the survival of many pharmacies and to program beneficiaries' access to pharmaceutical services.

(To be inserted following-prepared comments) The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 established a program of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs for persons electing Part B coverage under Medicare. The.CAct provides for reimbursement to participating pharmacies for prescriptions for single source drugs based on the lower of: (1) the average wholesaler price (AWP) for the drug dispensed plus $4.50 as a dispensing fee, (2) the pharmacy's usual and customary charges, or (3) the 90th percentile of usual and customary charges for like prescriptions in other pharmacies. Reimbursements to pharmacies for prescriptions for multisource drugs are based on the lower of: tl) the pharmacy's usual and customary charges or (2) the median AWP for the drug-entity dispensed plus $4.50 as a dispensing fee. Cursory comparison-of-the:,reimbursement formula under medicare with other programs have lead-some to mistakenly assume-that Medicare reimbursement for participating pharmacies is generous. However, careful consideration of the Medicare reimbursement formula and the unique aspects of the Medicare formula in contrast with-other programs reveal that Medicare reimbursement to participating pharmacies is fiscally conservative. Because of the\"!'lower of clause' in the Medicare-reimbursement formula, under no circumstances will a pharmacy be reimbursed more under Medicare for filling a prescription than thepharmacy would normally charge non-Medicare purchasers. If, for any reason, a pharmacy's usual and customary charge for a prescription is less than the sum of the average wholesale cost of the ingredient and the $4.50 dispensing fee, the pharmacy will be reimbursed the lower amount. Reimbursement for prescriptions for single source drugs is also limited not only to the individual pharmacy's usual and customary charge but to the 90 percentile of usual and customary charges for like prescriptions in all pharmacies.192 The average wholesale price (AWP) for products dispensed in pharmacies will be set and updated only semi-annually. Yet, pharmacies experience product price changes throughout the year. Therefore, pharmacies will have to accept fixed reimbursement levels for a six month period although product costs may have increased during the period. Moreover, the AWPs on which pharmacies will be reimbursed for their product costs will be 6 months out-of-date at the beginning of the period in which they are set. For example, AWPs on which pharmacies' reimbursement level,~ will be based for the period from January 1 to June 30 of each year will be based on prices being paid by pharmacies on July I of the previous year. Since the AWPs are 6 months out-of-date at the beginning of the period and are held fixed for 6 months, the AWPs will be 12 months out of date before they are updated. The net effect of using out-of-date AWPs and the lag in updating AWPs is that pharmacies will receive product reimbursement that is less i.e., effectively discounted, from what pharmacies would receive if they were actually reimbursed at updated AWP levels. The 90th percentile limit for reimbursement on prescriptions for single source drugs will also be based on usual and customary charges 12 to 18 months out-of-date. Thus, the maximum reimbursements to pharmacies on single source prescriptions will be capped at levels that do not reflect inflation during the previous 12 to 18 months. The use of dated AWPs, the use of-dated usual and customary ceilings for reimbursements on prescriptions for single source drugs, and lags in updating the AWPs on which pharmacies' reimbursement is calculated will result in Medicare reimbursement levels for pharmacies will be substantially less than AWP plus the $4.50 dispensing fee. Even if Medicare did not use dated AWPs and lag updating of AWPs, the \"lower of\" clause would ensure that pharmacies receive no more than their usual and customary charges for any prescriptions dispensed. However,-the use of dated AWPs and lags in updating AWPs combined with \"lower of\" clauses will result in reimbursement levels for pharmacies that are not generous. In fact, concern might more appropriately be placed on whether the current reimbursement basis and schedule for updating reimbursement rates are ones which will allow pharmacies to actively participate in the Medicare program.193 The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Thomas, thank you. I'll have a couple ofquestions in a moment. Mr. Laughrey. STATEMENT OF BRUCE LAUGHREY, R.PH., PRESIDENT OF MEDI- SPAN, INC., INDIANAPOLIS, IN Mr. LAUGHREY. Mr. Chairman, my name is Bruce Laughrey. I'mthe President of Medi-Span, Inc. of Indianapolis, IN.Medi-Span is a privately held corporation whose primary busi-ness is the collection of data and publishing of information con-cerning pharmaceuticals for the health care industry. Our custom-ers include retail pharmacists, drug-chains, manufacturers, whole-salers, insurers, third party administrators, health management or-ganizations, hospitals, and physicians. And we're pleased to acceptthis invitation to testify before this committee, and to share infor-mation concerning pharmaceutical pricing trends. Now, Medi-Span's prescription pricing guide was first publishedin 1977 as a monthly publication listing average wholesale priceand manufacturer direct price for approximately 6,000 of the mostcommonly used prescription drug pharmaceuticals. As a referencein my documentation, Figure 1 represents one of the pages fromthat document. Now, over the past 12 years Medi-Span has introduced --a varietyof printed publications, as well as expanded into providing comput-erized data bases of pharmaceutical information, and electronicmedia to support numerous computerized applications. Today Medi-Span's master drug database, a core file of information, containscurrent as well as historic price information on over 100,000 phar-maceutical and health-related products.in the U.S. market.The published average wholesale price, or AWP, is a key indexprice included in both our printed and electronic publications. ThisAWP is- widely accepted and used in the industry as a basis for thepurchase of drug products. In addition, many third party payers ofprescription insurance benefits reimburse phanmacists -on the basisof a professional fee .plns the cost of medication-provided. The- pub-lished AWP is- cost component in thie reimbursementformat. The publshed AWP is obtained directly from over 600pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers. Wevalidate this information published by using multiple informationsources where feasible. We would like to clarify that the published AWP is a standardreference price and does not recognize earned discounts for quanti-tyinchases, bidder contract pricing, or other forms of trade dis-counts; thus, the AWPE price is the price that the pharmacy wouldtypically pay if they purchased a single bottle of the item from alocal drug wholesaler. The published AWTP remains the only con-sistent price index that is useful. for comparative purposes.Much of the comparative-average wholesale price information wewere requested to -provide is included in one of our publications,the Generic Buying and Reimbursement.Guide, which is shown infigure 2. The GBRG, as we call it, is a quarterly publication sub- --scribed to by thousands of pharmacies.as an aid in selecting themost economical, therapeutic equivalent -product available in the194 marketplace. By including the average wholesale price information along with the FDA therapeutic equivalence evaluation code, the Orange Book rating, product selection, and buying decisions are greatly enhanced. The invitation to testify asked us to examine the pricing patterns of a specific set of drugs by referring to the AWP histories main- tained in our master drug data base. This set of 10 single source items frequently used by the elderly were found to have increased AWP at an annual average rate of 9.2 percent between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 1986. I refer you to table 1. This same set of single source drugs averaged a 7.9-percent AWP increase in 1987, and a 9 percent AWP increase during 1988. A set of 35 multiple source drugs frequently used by the elderly was also examined to determine AWP changes between 1982 and 1988. The originator brands of these multiple source drugs had an average annual AWP increase of 9.9 percent between 1982 and 1986, as referenced in table 2. In 1987 the average annual AWP in- crease was 6.9 percent, and in 1988, AWP increased by 6.4 percent, for the originator brands of this group of multiple source products. Not all of the multiple source drugs were off patent during the entire period of 1982 to 1986. More than one-third of the drugs in this group were still under patent protection for at least a part of the period of 1982 to 1986. It is noteworthy that the originator brands in both the single source drug group and the multiple source drug group had similar annual rates of increase in AWP between 1982 and 1986, with in- creases of 9.2 percent and 9.9 percent respectively. And I reference figure 3. It appears that, in general, single source drugs in a period just prior to patent expiration do not experience a slowed or declined rate of AWP increases, but rather the AWP changes continue for these products at rates similar to single source products. Now, once drug products have been off patent for several years, their rate of AWP increase does appear to moderate somewhat with respect to the rate of increase in AWP for single source products. The origina- tor brands of multiple source drugs had lower annual AWP in- creases than single source drugs in both 1987 and 1988. The origi- nator brand products tend to continue AWP price increases at about the -same or slightly lower rates as when the product was patent protected. This trend persists despite the fact that generic products may be introduced into the market, and may experience significant competition and decreases in AWP price. The price change patterns of all brand name manufacturers should not be painted with a single broad brush. In examining changes in AWP over time as products go off patent, one notes pat- terns unique to specific drug companies and to specific drug catego- ries. During 1987, for example, 11 of the 35 originator brands of multiple source drugs had no increase in AWP, while another 7 of the 35 had increases of 10 percent or more. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Laughrey, I hate to do this. Let's put the balance of your statement-or do you have much more of it? Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, I do have a chart that I wanted to refer- ence here. I noted that when Mr. Mossinghoff was here you did ref- erence this. If I could just address that chart, sir.195 -The CHAIRMAN. Yes. -Mr- LAUGHREY. This is a pricing pattern of a typical-The CHAIRMAN. Now, are we-talking about the patent expirationchart? Mr.- LAUGHREY. Yes. The chart on the left, before and afterpatent expiration. The CHAIRMAN. All right. Mr. LAUGHREY. Now, the pricing pattern of drug X representsthe classic pattern seen for many originator drug products as theygo off patent. Brand A of drug X has its first generic competitionfrom generic C in mid-1985. Despite the introduction of lower costtherapeutically equivalent products, such as generic C or generic D,-brand A continued to increase AWP at about the same rate as itdid when the product was patent protected. Generic B had set itsprice just under brand A at the time of the market entry, and hassince held that price constant. Generic C and D appear to havebeen engaged in competitive behavior; even though only four prod-ucts are shown for drug X in figure 4, there were actually morethan 35 companies marketing an FDA-rated therapeutic equivalentdrug product. Now, we do have other examples.The -CHAIRMAN. Well, let me ask, Mr. Laughrey, on generic B, onthe blue line, that's a new generic drug to compete with brand A,right? Mr. LAUGHREY. Yes, sir. The CHAIRMAN. Am I not mistaken, though, isn't generic B drugproduced by the same company that makes brand A? In otherwords, they've made their own generic to compete with their ownbrand drug, is this correct? Mr. LAUGHREY. I don't have knowledge that that -is--correct.That's a postulation that could possibly occur.Mr. LAUGHREY. If I could just summarize, sir.The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. Because we are out of time and we'regoing to move rapidly. Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, in summary, many drug companies appearto continue pricing their off-patent product in much the same wayas they priced that product as a single source agent. Even when anumber of generic products have come into the market and offerprices that are considerably below the original brand price, manydrug companies continue to hold, or even raise, the AWP of theirmultiple source product similar to that of a single source product.This general statement must be viewed with caution, however,since there are certain brand name manufacturers in certaintherapeutic categories where the brand name product is quite com-petitive in the multiple source market. [The prepared statement of Mr. Laughrey follows:]196 TESTIMONY OF J. BRUCE LAUGHREY, PRESIDENT MEDI-SPAN, INC. TO UNITED STATES SENATE THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING DAVID-PRYOR, CHAIRMAN TUESDAY, JULY 18, 1989 Mr. Chairman, my name is J. Bruce Laughrey, President of Medi-Span, Incorporated of Indianapolis, Indiana. Medi-Span is a privately-held corporation whose primary business is the collection of data and publishing of information concerning pharmaceuticals for the health-care industry. Our customers include retail pharmacists, drug chains, manufacturers, wholesalers, insurers,.third party administrators. HMO's, hospitals, an; physicians. We are pleased to accept this invitation to testify before this committee and to share information concerning pharmaceutical pricing trends. Medi-Span's Prescription Pricing Guide, first published in 1977, is a monthly publication listing Average Wholesale Price (AWP) and manufacturer's Direct Prices (DP) for approximately 6,000 of the most commonly used prescription pharmaceuticals (See Figure 1). Over the past twelve years, Medi- Span has introduced a variety of printed publications as well as expanded into providing computerized databases of pharmaceutical information in electronic media to support numerous computerized applications. Today, Medi-Span's MASTER DRUG DATA BASE (MDDB) a core file of information contains current as well as historic price information on over 100,000 pharmaceutical and health related products in the United States market. The published Average Wholesale Price, or AWP, is a key index price included in both our print and electronic publications. This AWP is widely accepted and used in the industry as the basis for the purchase of drug products. In addition, many third party payers of prescription insurance benefits reimburse pharmacists on the basis of a professional fee plus the cost of medication provided. The published AWP is used as the cost component in this reimbursement formula. The published AWP is obtained directly from over 600 pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers. We validate the information published by using multiple information sources where feasible.197 We would like to clarify that the published AWP is a standard reference price and does not recognize earned discounts for quantity purchases, bid or contract pricing or other forms of trade discounts. Thus, the AWP is the price that the pharmacy would typically pay if they purchased a single bottle of the item from a local drug wholesaler. The published AWP remains the only consistent index price that is useful for comparative purposes. Much of the comparative Average Wholesale Price information we were requested to provide is included in one of our publications, the Generic Buying and Reimbursement Guide (GBRG) (Sample page Figure 2). The GBRG is a quarterly -publication, subscribed to by thousands of pharmacies, as an aid in selecting the most economical. therapeutic equivalent product available in the marketplace. By including the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) information along with the FDA therapeutic equivalence evaluation ode (\"Orange Book\" rating), product selection and buying decisions are greatly enhanced. ,The invitation to testify asked us to examine the pricing patterns of a specific set of drugs by referring to the AWP histories maintained in our MASTER DRUG DATA BASE (MDDB). This set of ten single-source items frequently used by the elderly, were found to have increased AWP at an average annual rate of 9.2 percent between January 1, 1982 and December 31, 1986 (Table 1). This same set of single-source drugs averaged a 7.9 percent AWP increase in 1987 and a 9.0 percent AWP increase during 1988. A set of thirty-five multiple-source drugs, frequently used by the elderly, was also examined to determine AWP changes between 1982 and 1988. The originator brands of these multiple-source drugs had an average annual AWP price increase of 9.9 percent between 1982 and 1986 (Table 2). In 1987, the average annual AWP increase was 6.9 percent, and in 1988 AWP increased by 6.4 percent for the originator brands of this group of multiple source drugs. Not all of the multiple-source drugs were off patent during the entire period of 1982 to 1986. More than one-third of the drugs in this group were still under patent protection for at least part of the period 1982 to 1986. It is noteworthy that the originator brands in both the single-source drug group and the multiple-source drug group had similar annual rates of increase in AWP between 1982 and 1986 with increases of 9.2% and 9.9% respectively (Figure 3). It appears that, in general, single-source drugs in the period just prior to patent expiration do not experience a slowed, or declined, rate of AWP198 increases, but rather the AWP changes continue for these products at rates similar to single-source products (Figure 3). Once drug products have been off patent for several years, their rate of ANVP increase does appear to moderate somewhat with respect to the rate of increase in AWP for single-source products. (Figure 3). Originator brands of multiple-source drugs had lower annual AWP increases than single-source drugs in both 1987 and 1988. Originator brand products tend to continue AWP price increases at about the same, or slightly lower, rates as when the product was patent protected. This trend persists despite the fact that generic products may be introduced into the market and may experience significant competition and decreases in AWP prices. The price change patterns of all brand name manufacturers should not be painted with a single broad brush. In examining changes in AWP over time as products go off patent, one notes patterns unique to specific drug companies and to specific drug therapy categories. During 1987, for example, eleven of the thirty-five originator brands of multi-source drugs had no increase in AWP, while another seven of the thirty-five had increases of 10 percent or more (Table 3). Actual pricing patterns for therapeutically equivalent versions of four multiple-source drug products are illustrated in Figures 4 through 7. These figures are case studies presented only for the purpose of showing typical patterns of actual pricing behavior, not to highlight the pricing decisions of a particular company. The pricing pattern of Drug X (Figure 4) represents the classic pattern seen for many originator drug products as they go off patent. Brand A of Drug X has its first generic competition from Generic C in mid-1985. Despite the introduction of lower cost, therapeutically equivalent products such as Generic C or Generic D, Brand A continued to increase AWP at about the same rate as it did when the product was patent protected. Generic B had set its price just under Brand A at the time of market entry and has since held that price constant. Generic C and D appear to have been engaged in competitive behavior. Even though only four products are shown for Drug X in Figure 4, there are actually more than 35 companies marketing and FDA \"A\" rated therapeutically equivalent drug product.199 Drug Y (Figure 5) and Drug Z (Figure 6) exhibit patterns similar to Drug X as previously discussed. These additional cases are included to show typical variations in this classic pricing pattern. Drug Z, for example, shows that Brand A did not announce an AWT increase in the first year after introduction of generic competition. In the following year, however, Brand A increased its AWP even though generic competitors had considerably lower prices. The company of Brand A has since continued increasing its AWP while generic AWP prices of Generics C, D, and E appear to have leveled off and are in a fairly narrow price range. The Brand A AWP in the Drug X, Y. and Z cases is considerably higher than the lowest generic price. The range of prices can be compared by determining the ratio of the highest AWP for a drug product to the.low-est AWP for'the same product. This high to low AWP ratio has been calculated for each of the multiple-source drug product groups (Table 4). Some multiple-source drug product groups have AWNP's that differ by high-to-low ratios as high as 20 to 1, or even 32 to 1. Drug Q (See Figure 7) provides an interesting pricing pattern in contrast to the more typical patterns observed with Drugs X, Y, and Z. The high-to-low ratio is only about 2 to -1,.:iirdicating that Brand A of Drug Q was more \"price competitive\" than was'Brand A of Drugs X, Y. or Z. Also, Brand A of Drug Q appears to have extended the length of time betnecen price increases. In summary, many drug companies appear to continue pricing their off- patent product in much the same way as they priced that product as a single- source agent. Even when a number of generic products have come into the market and offer prices that are considerably below the original brand price, many drug companies continue to hold or even raise the AWP of their multiple-source product similar to that of a singlc-source product. This general statement must be viewed with caution, however,. since there are certain brand name manufacturers and certain therapeutic categories where the brand name product is quite competitive in the multiple-source market.200 F1GLJRE I MEDI-SPAWsHAL-IND GENERIC 3RD QUARTER .,01 0,42 ... .012 ,1 a.2 422 MG 00 2 0 0 010 2 22LA 0 2 .\" 2 4 0 A .0 .......... 200 0 4 2 0 0.01 0 1 0 ... ... . 2 40.

I really want to thank you. I sat up last night and read as much as I could about Medi-span and it is a very valu- able service. Dr. Thomas, let me just-ask you. We've heard a lot of discussion this morning about the free marketplace, free enterprise, et cetera, what is the Congress going to have to do, if anything, to bring these prices of prescription drugs down, or at least to arrest the very rapidly increasing prices. What do we do as a Congressman? Mr. THOMAS. Senator Pryor, I'd really be a bit reluctant to ad- dress that. I mean, the one point that I did want to make was the fact that pharmacists, community pharmacies haven't been respon- sible for the increase. The CHAIRMAN. I agree with you 100 percent. Mr. THOMAS. And that the approach in terms of hitting commu- nity pharmacy or retail pharmacy reimbursements is not an effec- tive approach, and would be an incorrect approach because of the negative impacts that it would have. The CHAIRMAN. I've talked to a lot of retail pharmacists in my own State and they are very depressed about what they see and what they have gone through, and what they see in the future, be- cause they see no let up for standing there behind the counter on a daily basis and telling their customers, the consumers, that their drugs are going up again. And they're very, very concerned and de- pressed about this. What do you think the Congress has to do, Mr. Laughrey? Is there. anything we can do? Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, I think, with respect to the Medicare Cata- strophic Act of 1987, Congress did, in fact, address that issue with the multiple source products and that they determined that a fair -and equitable price to reimburse upon would be a median price. As to the patented prescription drug items, I'm not sure I could answer what-Congress should do. I certainly wouldn't suggest that they would deter in any way the tremendous amount of innovation that occurs in pharmaceutical manufacture. Beyond that I guess I just couldn't comment, sir. The CHAIRMAN. Do you see, in the next 5 or 10 years a continu- ation of our chart going up each year, say, from 8 to 12 percent, on most of our drugs? Is this going to continue? Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, that would be conjecture on my part. I would guess after this hearing, perhaps not. [Laughter.] The CHAIRMAN. What about you, Dr. Thomas? Mr. THOMAS. As Mr. Laughrey said, that would really be just conjecture on my part also. It was interesting that in Mr. Mossinghoff's testimony he men- tioned that the rate of price increases had decreased. I'm sure you'll be watching carefully to see what trend develops over the next couple of years. The CHAIRMAN. As my colleagues left the room this morning one of them whispered over to me, he says, I see the problem, now what's the solution? And we're going to be at that stage, and that's going to be part of what we're going to be talking about at our next hearing.207 Were you surprised, either one of you-let's put the internation-al drug pricing chart back up-were you surprised to see that par-ticular chart showing how much more Americans pay for the samedrugs as our European friends? Did this surprise either one of you?Dr. Thomas. Mr. THOMAS. I have to say the extent of the range in the priceswas a bit surprising to me. The fact that there was quite a bit ofdiversity was not a surprise. I was aware of that. But the rangewas a bit surprising. The CHAIRMAN. By the way, in the past I think the pharmaceuti-cal manufacturers have maintained it is impossible to. accuratelyreflect the data in this chart. I don't know what kind of analyticaldata this is or how valid it is, but I know that the Italian pharma-ceutical manufacturers association did this particular workup.That's where we got it, and that's the best I've. ever seen in com-paring our prices to some of the European prices.What about you, Mr. Laughrey, were you surprised at this?Mr. LAUGHREY. I guess not. I've known that there have beenprice disparities internationally. But then again, I believe that per-haps a socialistic country might buy in bulk, and achieve a quanti-ty discount. The CHAIRMAN. Well, we're talking about the same pharmaceuti-cals that are sold here that are sold there. Do you think the bulkbuying would reflect that sort of a variation? I would have troublefinding that. Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, our company doesn't track internationalpricing. If in fact that chart is correct, it's a little surprising.The CHAIRMAN. Does it also maybe surprise you a little bit, orwould you have any comment on the fact that we give them R&Dtax credits, the opportunity to manufacture in Puerto Rico with notaxes under Section 936, an exemption in State sales tax and othertaxes for them to locate in some States, and even with all of that,give them a patent for 17 years, and they sell these drugs so muchmore cheaply in other countries than they sell them in this coun-try? Does that do anything to you? Mr. LAUGHREY. It doesn't sound inconsistent with our other eco-nomic policies worldwide, sir.The CHAIRMAN. Maybe that's why we're in such a mess.Dr. Thomas, do you have any comments on that?Mr. THOMAS. Not on that. If I could go back to one of your earli-er questions, I'd like to comment. The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Mr. THOMAS. In terms of what you were asking; what we coulddo in controlling prescription drug expenditure increases, I thinkyou do have to look at the expenditures as well as the prices. Oneof the things that I would like to see in terms of developing a pre-scription drug program benefit is that we provide some positive in-centives to pharmacists for some of the activities that they performthat improve and lower total program costs. For example, when apharmacist takes action in terms of identifying a drug interaction,or identifying that a patient is on duplicate drug therapy, and callsthe physician and persuades the physician that no drug is needed.The pharmacist doesn't get any reimbursement for that. The phar-208 macist has no positive incentive to perform that type of activity, except based on his role as a professional. The CHAIRMAN. Right. Mr. THOMAS. I think we do need to gather some additional data to understand better the factors behind the increases in drug prices. As we've seen here today, it's a very complex issue. And changes in one part of the system have consequences in other parts of the system that we may not actually be looking at as we effect those. So I think it's obvious that there is a need for gathering much more data. The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. Mr. THOMAS. One other- point,, and that's that we need to really develop some data so we understand the relationship,- something that Mr. Mossinghoff mentioned, the. relationship between expendi- tures on drugs and other medical expenditures. The CHAIRMAN. All right. Let me ask you this question. Were you surprised earlier this morning, if you were here, when you saw that Medicare pays so much more for their drugs that they buy than the Veterans Ad- ministration, like $29 to $5? Mr. THOMAS. I have to say that I was not. -The CHAIRMAN. You were not surprised? Mr. THOMAS. I was not. The CHAIRMAN. Why were you not surprised? Mr. -THOMAS. Beijg aware of the fact that the system that the -Veterans Administflation operates on versus the system that Med- icaid system works on, they really are two different systems. And Medicaid ends up paying the prices that pharmacists pay to obtain those drugs. The CHAIRMAN. I know, but it all comes out of the same pocket, doesn't it? Mr. THOMAS. It does comenout of the same pocket, but given the fact that there- are two different systems and. the way that those systems operate, I was not surprised. The CHAIRMAN. What would you think about letting the Veter- ans Administration become the buyer of prescription drugs for the -U.S. Government? 'Let them do all -the Medicaid, and all the 2Medi- care purchasing. What would you think of that? Mr. THOMAS. I think ihereoare-samu things that have to be con- sidered.before I'd&move- ind-fthit .dinedtion. First of all, the Veterans Administration can act.as .a depot system because of the number of final distribution centers that-are involved. Community pharmacies really are -the most accessible form of health care -for patients. It 'would be very difficult with a depot system to administer a type of program that -would. function 'and provide those drugs to those pharmacies. It would be very expensive on an administrative basis. The CHAIRMAN. We're just trying to find the answers. Mr. THOMAS. There may be other avenues that take advantage of some of the things that the Veterans Administration does. The CHAIRMAN. If you know of those avenues, would you please write me a letter, or call me up, because we're looking for those answers. Mr. THOMAS. I would be glad to explore those with you.209 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Laughrey, do you have any comments onthat final line of questioning? Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, the product in question was Motrin. It haslost its patent, it is now available as a multiple source product, soit didn't surprise me that in fact the VA hospitals could receive a$5 price as opposed to the $29 price that Medicare might pay.Single source items, it might be a little more difficult to negotiatethose types of discounts given our retail pharmacists' distributionsystem. The CHAIRMAN. Do you think that Medicare should attempt tonegotiate with the vendors, just like the Veterans Administrationhas? Mr. LAUGHREY. I think they should attempt to. Obviously, if wecan save our taxpayers' money-The CHAIRMAN. Watching trends in drug prices, would you haveany faith or any reason to believe that the drug manufacturerswould want to negotiate with Medicare, just as some of them mighthave with the Veterans Administration?Mr. LAUGHREY. I would guess they would prefer not to negotiate.The CHAIRMAN. Why? Mr. LAUGHREY. I think they want to continue their level of prof-itability as they have in the past.The CHAIRMAN. Which has been relatively or extremely high?Mr. LAUGHREY. Well, that's a postulation again on my part. I'dsay it's reasonably high.The CHAIRMAN. OK, sir.I want to thank both of you. You've been very constructive thismorning, and again, very patient. And we're going to put your fullstatements in the record, and we'll perhaps be calling on you againfor your expertise and your knowledge, and certainly your coopera-tion. We have Mr. Louis Hays. Mr. Hays, we welcome you today. Idon't know if you had to sit through all of this this morning, butwe've had a very lively discussion on prescription drug prices,costs, value, et cetera. And we look forward to your statement.We're going to try to limit this statement to 5 minutes, and then Iwill have a few questions, not many. But we appreciate youcoming, and appreciate your statement. The full body of your state-ment will be printed in the record. STATEMENT OF LOUIS B. HAYS, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR OFHCFA, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Mr. HAYS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased tobe here today to discuss the pricing of outpatient prescriptiondrugs under the Medicare Program.At the outset, let me reiterate that our estimates of the Medicareoutpatient prescription drug program continue to show that theprogram is considerably underfunded. Over the first 4 years of theprogram, benefits are expected to exceed the premiums received bynearly $800 million, and with administrative costs included, theshortfall rises to almost $2.8 billion. I understand that the mostrecent Congressional Budget Office projections are consistent nowwith the administration's projections.210 With respect to the drug pricing mechanism under the new drug program, the law is very specific with regard to Medicare payments for outpatient prescription drugs. After the annual deductible is met, Medicare will pay the lesser of the pharmacy's. actual charge for the drug, or an applicable payment limit minus the required co- insurance amount. The payment limit depends on whether the drug is available from multiple sources, only a single source, or as a brand name drug specified in writing by the physician. The pay- ment limit for smost drugs will be average wholesale price of the drug. While the term \"average wholesale price\". is-suggestive of the amount that pharmacies actually pay for.drugs, it is in fact, signifi- cantly higher than -actual costs. The average wholesale price is somewhat comparable to the. manufacturer's -sticker price on a new car. Indeed, there have been a number of studies which indicate that published average wholesale price for drugs overstates the actual prices paid by as much as 10 to 20 percent, because of discounts, special offers, or purchasing incentives. Unlike the Medicaid Pro- gram, we have no authority to take advantage of these discounts under Medicare. You specifically asked.that I mention our decision on -the newly approved drug, Epoetin, otherwise known as EPO. On June 1, the Food and Drug Administration approved Epoetin for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. This drug is expen- sive, and since the Medicare Program pays the vast majority of ex- penses for end-stage renal disease patients, we held significant dis- cussions with the company that received FDA approval for the drug, namely, Amgen Inc. Based on those discussions, which in- cluded examination of detailed cost data volunteered by Amgen, we set a reasonable price to pay kidney-dialysis facilities for the ad- ministration of this drug in conjunction with dialysis treatment. The price we announced is $4,650 for each person receiving Epoe- tin. We plan to evaluate the price in 6 months, but we believe the price we set is reasonable for both dialysis facilities and the tax- payer. The Department has been concerned with the cost of the outpa- tient prescription drug program since discussions of the benefit began over 2 years ago. In a May 1989 report to Congress we out- lined the assumptions used in calculating the $2.8 billion deficit in -the drug trust fund. We estimate that Medicare beneficiaries who purchased prescriptions in 1988 purchased an average of 21.5 pre- scriptions in that year. By 1993, that figure will rise to 23.3 pre- scriptions. We also estimate that the average cost for outpatient prescription drugs will increase from $18.21 in 1988 to $24.26 by 1993. Finally, we assume an induced demand effect which could in- crease aggregate consumption of drugs by the Medicare population by about 10 percent in 1991, 12 percent in 1992, and 11 percent in 1993. We are also preparing a report to Congress on drug prices and pharmacy charges as required by the catastrophic legislation. Allow me to describe briefly some of the trends that we will be mentioning in our report.9 9 See appendix 3 draft report to Congress on Manufacturers' Prices and Pharmacists' charges.211 The producer price index measures the change over time in theprices received in commercial transactions by manufacturers andproducers of various goods. In the case of prescription drugs, theproducer price index, or PPI, is a measure of the change in pricescharged by drug manufacturers for the drugs they sell. Between1981 and 1986 the annual growth rate in the PPI for prescriptiondrugs was 10.1 percent. In 1987 and 1988 the PPI moderated some-what to 9.6 percent and 7.9 percent respectively. Similar trendshave been noted in the growth of the consumer price index fordrugs as well. In concluding my statement, Mr. Chairman, I would note thatthe catastrophic drug benefit represents a major expansion of theMedicare Program, and presents us with enormous administrativechallenges. As we proceed with implementation, on schedule, weare concerned by the projected underfunding of the drug trust fundand the volatility of prescription drug prices in recent years. Welook forward to working with this committee, and the others in theCongress, to help ensure that the drug program is financiallysound, and that it serves Medicare beneficiaries well. I would behappy to answer any questions that you might have, Mr. Chair-man. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hays follows:]212 STATEMENT OF LOUIS B. HAYS ACTING ADMINISTRATOR HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING UNITED STATES SENATE JULY 18, 1989 Good morning. I am pleased to be here today to discuss the pricing of outpatient prescription drugs under Medicare. At the outset, I must reiterate, as stated in our May 1989 Report to Congress concerning the catastrophic outpatient drug program, that HCFA estimates of the Medicare outpatient drug program continue to show that the program is considerably underfunded. Over the first four years of the program (1990 -1993), benefit payments are expected to exceed premiums received by nearly $800 million. With administrative costs included, the shortfall rises to almost $2.8 billion. I understand that the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections are consistent with the Administration's projections. By the end of 1992, we project that there will be insufficient cash on hand in the Catastrophic Drug Insurance-Trust Fund to pay claims, and some benefit payments will have to-be deferred until additional premiums come in. With the financial difficulty facing the drug trust fund as a sobering reminder of our responsibility to foster the drug program's viability, allow me to share with you an explanation of the new drug benefit and its financing mechanism, as well as information on the trends in prescription drug costs over the past several years. 1213 THE MEDICARE OUTPATIENT DRUG BENEFIT The outpatient prescription drug program under Medicare is intended to help relieve the financial burden sometimes imposed on beneficiaries by unusually high outpatient prescription drug bills. This new benefit represents a significant expansion of Medicare. Beginning in 1990, Medicare will pay for drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy and certain home intravenous (IV) drugs. In 1991, the benefit will expand to include all other outpatient prescription drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After a beneficiary has satisfied an annual deductible, Medicare will pay its share of the cost of a particular drug, and the beneficiary will be responsible for the remainder, a so-called coinsurance amount. With some exceptions, the coinsurance amount is 50 percent in 1991, 40 percent in 1992, and 20 percent in 1993 and thereafter (providing the required contingency margin for the Catastrophic Drug Insurance Trust Fund is met). OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING UNDER MEDICARE The law is very specific with regard to Medicare payments for outpatient prescription drugs. After the annual deductible is met, Medicare will pay the lesser of the pharmacy's actual charge for the drug, or the applicable payment limit, minus the required coinsurance amount. The method Medicare must employ in calculating payment limits is set in law. While it is a rather detailed methodology, allow me to briefly mention key aspects of it to give you a flavor for the very explicit and inflexible nature of the methodology. It is readily apparent that very little, if any, opportunity exists within this payment framework to encourage cost savings in the outpatient drug program. The methodology for calculating Medicare's payment for a drug depends on whether the drug is available from multiple sources, only a single source, or is a brand name drug specified in writing by the physician.214 For single source drugs and multiple source drugs with brand names prescribed: Prior to January 1, 1992, the payment limit is the number of units dispensed multiplied by the per unit average price for the drug, plus an administrative allowance. Beginning January 1, 1992, the payment limit is the lesser of the calculation specified above or the 90th percentile of the actual charge per unit computed on a geographic basis for the second previous calculation period, adjusted to reflect the number of units dispensed. For multiple source drugs: The payment limit is the number of units dispensed multiplied by the average price per unit plus the administrative allowance. To determine the average price of single source drugs, the Secretary.is.required-to conduct a biannual survey of direct sellers, wholesalers, or pharmacies as appropriate. If the sales volume of a drug is so low that such a survey is not appropriate, or for other reasons, the Secretary may price the drug based only on the published average wholesale price. To determine the average price of multiple source drugs, the Secretary may price the drug based on either the published average wholesale price or the biannual survey. Even while I have spared you many of the details and nuances of the law, it is clear that HCFA has little room to innovate within this rigid payment system. Under current law, HCFA has no authority to negotiate more competitive prices or demand the discounts warranted by the large volume of business the Medicare program represents. Indeed, the statute requires us to exclude from the price survey the discounts which pharmacies typically receive from drug companies. Thus, the survey prices will overstate actual pharmacy costs. Multiple source drugs make up the lion's share of the prescription drug market, and, essentially, Medicare will pay the average wholesale price for these drugs. While the term \"average wholesale price\" is suggestive of the amount that pharmacies actually pay for drugs, it is significantly higher than actual costs. The average wholesale price is somewhat comparable to the manufacturer's \"sticker price\" on a new car -- this is rarely the price actually215 paid for the car. Indeed, there have been a number of studies which indicate that the published average wholesale price for drugs overstates actual prices paid by as much as 10 to 20 percent because of discounts, special offers or purchasing incentives. The states have had more than 20 years of experience paying for prescription drugs under the Medicaid program. Many states have employed creative and cost effective methods of limiting their drug costs without lowering the quality of care. For example, the state of Maine pays the average wholesale price minus 5 percent, while both Tennessee and Ohio pay the average wholesale price minus 7.5 percent. To further illustrate, South Carolina pays the average wholesale price minus 9.5 percent, and Texas pays the average wholesale price minus 10.5 percent. These reductions from the average wholesale price are usually based on surveys, conducted by states, of dispensing costs and actual acquisition costs for pharmacies. EPOETIN You specifically asked that I mention our decision on the newly approved drug epoetin. On June 1, the FDA approved epoetin for 4 the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. This drug is expensive -- some countries in Europe are paying $9,000 to $11,000 per year per patient for this drug. Since the Medicare program pays the vast majority of expenses for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients, we held significant discussions with the company that received FDA approval, AMGEN, Inc. Based on those discussions, which included the examination of detailed cost data volunteered by AMGEN, we set a reasonable price to pay kidney dialysis facilities for the administration of this drug in conjunction with dialysis treatment. I should note that the cost data were easy to evaluate because epoetin is AMGEN's first marketable product. The price we announced is $4,650 for each patient receiving epoetin. We must still set coverage guidelines and payment rates outside dialysis facilities, and we plan to evaluate the price in six months. We believe the price we set is reasonable for both dialysis facilities and the taxpayer.216 REPORTS TO CONGRESS TheDepartment has been concerned with the projected cost of the outpatient prescription drug program since discussions of such a benefit began over two years ago. In a May 1989 Report to Congress entitled, \"Expenses Incurred by Medicare Beneficiaries for Prescription Drugs\", the Department outlined the assumptions used in calculating the estimated $2.8 billion deficit in the drug trust fund. The Department estimates that Medicare beneficiaries who purchased prescriptions in 1988 purchased an average of 21.5 prescriptions in that year. By 1993,-outpatient prescription drug users will purchase an average of 23.3 outpatient prescriptions. We also estimate that the cost per outpatient prescription drug will increase from $18.21 in 1988 to $24.26 by 1993. Perhaps the most difficult element ofrthe program's cost to estimate is that of induced demand. It is commonly acknowledged in the insurance industry that the very act of coverage tends to increase demand for the covered service. This insurance effect is called \"induced demand.' HCFA actuaries assume an insurance effect which would increase aggregate consumption of drugs by the Medicare population by about 10 percent in 1991, 12 percent in 1992, and 11 percent in 1993. The Department is.afsvtpreparing a report to Congress on.drug manufacturers' prices and pharmacists' charges as required by the MCCA of 1988. Allow me to briefly describe some of the prescription drug industry trends we mention in our report. The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures-the change over time in the prices received in commercial-transactions by manufacturers and producers of various goods. In the case of prescription drugs, the PPI ismaameasure of the change in prices exacted by drug manufacturers for the prescription drugs they sell. Between 1981 and'1986, the annual growth rate-in the PPI for prescription drugs was 10.1 percent. In 1987 and 1988, the PPI increased 9.6 percent and 7.9, respectively. The Consumer Price'Index (CPI) is a widely used measure of inflation-infthe consumer economy. -During the 1970's, the CPI for prescription drugs grew very slowly, much more slowly than the CPI for all items. During the 1980's, however, the CPI for217 prescription drugs grew very rapidly, far outpacing the growth in the CPI for all items. For example, between 1981 and 1986, the average annual growth rate in the CPI for prescription drugs was 10.2 percent, while the average annual percent change in the CPI for all items was 4.2 percent. This trend moderated slightly in 1987 and 1988, with the CPI for prescription drugs increasing by 8.0 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively, in those years. The CPI for drugs has kept pace with the PPI rather consistently -- essentially, pharmacists have not increased their prices more than what was necessary to keep pace with their increasing costs of purchasIng drugs. In light of the financial difficulty facing the drug trust fund, we are looking with a cautious eye at the very rapid growth in the CPI and PPI for prescription drugs since 1981. We are also aware that, since 1980, the CPI for prescription drugs has risen more rapidly than any other component of the CPI for medical items -- including physician services. Clearly, the drug benefit has the potential to be a volatile program. I should point out at this time that the implementation schedule for the drug benefit is extremely tight. Implementation on January 1, 1991 will require the timely execution of a number of critical tasks both inside and outside the Department, most important of which is the procurement of the drug bill processors. The full cooperation of all parties will be required in order to accomplish what is, by any measure, a very complex procurement. There is virtually no tolerance in this schedule. Any delay in this process will make implementation within the legislatively required timeframe extremely difficult to achieve. CONCLUSION In concluding my statement, I would note that the catastrophic outpatient prescription drug benefit represents a major expansion of the Medicare program, and is laden with enormous administrative challenges. As we forge ahead with implementation, on schedule, we are concerned by the projected underfunding of the drug trust fund and the volatility of prescription drug prices in recent years. We look forward to working with this Committee and others to help ensure that the drug program is financially sound and that it serves Medicare beneficiaries well.218 The CHATmAN. Mr. Hays, you started off and ended your state- ment talking about the underfunding of the Medicare prescription drug program. Mr. HAYS. Yes, sir. The CHAImAN. Wouldn't we have more funds in that program if we got a better deal for the recipients of those programs? For ex- ample, like the VA; they get a pretty good deal for those veterans. Mr. HAYS. The statutory requirements for drug pricing for the Medicare Program under catastrophic are very specific, and some would argue, quite generous. The CHAIRMAN. Generous? Mr. HAys. Generous in the resulting price that Medicare will be required to pay for prescription drugs. The CHAIRMAN. Who is the beneficiary of that generosity? Is it the consumer, the taxpayer, the Medicare beneficiary, or the phar- maceutical manufacturers? Mr. HAYS. Most directly, the retail drug store which is filling the prescription and is the recipient of the amount that Medicare will pay, along with the co-insurance that the beneficiary will pay. -Indi- rectly, I would assume the pharmaceutical -industry in general. But the price that Medicare pays is the price that goes directly to the retail pharmacy that is dispensing the prescription for the benefici- ary. The CHAHIMAN. You know, I'm on the Finance Committee. I'm wearing two hats today. And I remember the debate on catastroph- ic-maybe I was absent that day-but it's beyond me how we al- lowed, or did not put into the catastrophic insurance~legislation an incentive, or inducement for Medicare to -get the best price. How'd we forget-that? What happened to us? Where were you? Why .didn't you tell us that we were doing wrong? Everyone else has told us what we did wrong. [Laughter.] Mr. HAys. Well, I was not.privy to those discussions. The CHAIRMAN. You could have slipped a note under the door. Mr. HAys. Certainly, I believe that those issues were brought to the attention of the various parties who were considering the legis- lation. The CHAOmAN. You've had some negotiations with the drug manufacturer, Amgen, who's here today. By the way, the only manufacturer who showed up. We're proud of Amgen. Now, you did. some negotiations, I believe, with this company, is that correct? Mr. HAYS. We spent the better part of a year in discussions with Amgen over their newly approved, product EPO. The CHAIRMAN. Now, I don't know if you negotiated a good price for the Medicare beneficiaries or-a bad price. What do you main- tain? Mr. HAys. We-feel that.the price that we have established for the drug is a fair price, both for the Medicare program and for the fa- cilities who will be providing the drug to Medicare patients. The CHAIRMAN. Now this is a question that's going to show my ignorance of this field. Why could you negotiate with Amgen on this particular drug and not negotiate on other drugs that we pur- chase through Medicare?219 Mr. HAYS. There are a couple of reasons, Mr. Chairman. Thepricing mechanism that we have been talking about principally upuntil this point has to do with the benefit that becomes effective onJanuary 1, 1991, the full outpatient prescription drug benefit. Wedo not, as you know, today, under Medicare pay for outpatient pre-scription drugs. The particular drug in question, involving Amgen,is a somewhat unique situation. It is covered under Medicare be-cause of the way in which it is administered in renal dialysis facili-ties for patients that are receiving kidney dialysis. And we arepaying for it as an adjunct to the end-stage renal disease programin a somewhat unique fashion: And it is because we are paying forit through the end-stage renal disease program that we were ableto pay for it. If we had paid for it under the regular Medicare Program follow-ing the usual reasonable charge methodology, we would undoubted-ly have ended up paying substantially more for this drug.The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Hays, I thank you.Now, Mr. Hays, just one or two more questions. What would youthink of the Veterans Administration being appointed? They seemto have gotten a good deal for the veterans. What about the Veter-ans Administration being appointed to do all the buying for Medi-care prescription drugs? What's wrong with that?Mr. HAYS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that the threshold ques-tion is whether there are so many differences between the Veter-ans Administration's system and the Medicare Program that theywould preclude our taking advantage of the Veterans Administra-tion program. The significant difference, of course, is the fact thatthe Veterans Administration is in the position of actually provid-ing drugs directly to their beneficiaries, the veterans. It's quite adifferent situation, I believe, from the Medicare Program where weare dealing with 33 million beneficiaries who will be obtainingtheir prescriptions through the existing network of 55,000 or 60,000retail pharmacies around the country. And I guess I would submitthat it is one thing for the Veterans Administration, which is ineffect a provider of drugs to go through their process, and anotherthing for the Medicare Program which is primarily a financingmechanism as opposed to a delivery mechanism to do the same.Be that as it may, I think that it is certainly worth looking at. Itmay be worthwhile pursuing a demonstration project, or somethingof that sort. But I would point out that current law does not giveus that authority. The CHAIRMAN. Well, the law could be changed, if it would be aconstructive change. And that's again what the Aging Committeeis looking at. But we are going to do something, as I told Mr. Mos-singhoff, and I hope he didn't consider this a threat. It was not athreat, it was just a fact that we're going to do something. This in-stitution, this Congress is going to do something. We're going to dosomething about Catastrophic. I don't know what, but we're goingto do something. I wish I knew. And we're going to do somethingabout the escalating costs of drugs. I mean, this institution is goingto react to that. And I hope that we don't overreact. I hope we actin the right way.220 I'm all supportive of some of the things that the pharmaceutical manufacturers -have done. I'm very critical of others. And I've stated those criticisms today. Mr. HAYS. We certainly wish you well and we would be pleased to cooperate with your staff- The CHAIRMAN. I'm also believing that we. can get a better price, Mr. Hays, for those prescription drugs we are today buying for the Medicare beneficiaries. We can do it. And I thank you very, very much for coming. Mr. HAYS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. Now, I have a final witness this morning. That is George Rathmann, chairman of the board, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA. Mr. Rathmann, you have been a patient man. You have sat here for hours listening to all of this. I don't know if you heard anything new. I heard some things that I certainly didn't know before. During the process of preparing for this hearing, I learned a lot, and I hope that we can put these suggestions to constructive use. We look forward to your statement. STATEMENT OF GEORGE B. RATHMANN, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, AMGEN INC., THOUSAND OAKS, CA Mr. RATHMANN. Thank you. The statement that's been submitted also includes a Business Week survey on research and development funding in which Amgen ranks first in terms of dollars spent per employee and as a percent of sales. The CHAIRMAN. We laud you for being the only manufacturer that we invited who came. You came all. the way from California and we are very indebted. Mr. RATHMANN. Well, I think I can explain that, and it's a credit to the industry as well as us that we're here. We are the newest biopharmaceutical company. Our first product went on the market, just a month ago. The biopharmaceutical in- dustry only has two companies that presently market products, and we're the second. The industry is very promising; it could continue to expand the pharmaceutical advantage the United States has. As of now, there are only two biopharmaceutical companies based on advanced biotechnology, specifically genetic engineering to make new rationally designed drugs. Now there are really two reasons why we're here. And one is that we really feel we have -a role in helping the public and the Congress to understand this industry. And, as a matter of fact, helping the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, of which we are research affiliates, explain this industry to the Congress and to the public. In a moment I'll explain-why. The second reason is that we have held discussions with the Health Care Financing Administration for over a year, and in many respects that's an ex- perience that has not occurred before. There are also some specific reasons for this and we must be careful not to generalize, obvious- ly, and we'll help to share what we know about that relationship with you. First I'd like to address why we can help in this process. First of all, we have only one product. The investments that have been221 made in our company are public documents. They're all available.Our sales curves will relate to this one product until our secondproduct is introduced, hopefully some time next year. So. that allthe information is tied together in a pretty neat package, and canbe interpreted from public data. There is no confidentiality issue.-The only issue we might have is someone trying to ask us what-we're apt-Ao see in sales 2 or 3 years out. That's difficult for us todo,--but other than that our information is totally available andthere's no reason not to help you interpret that information in thebest possible way. And it does give insights into the nature of theprocess of creating a new pharmaceutical drug. By the way, ours is a 1-A drug, a drug of significant therapeuticvalue. Our next one will probably also be the same. It's one ofthose drugs that represents a new molecular entity of great impor-tant therapeutic gain, recognized by the FDA. The CHAIRMAN. Now, how many of those drugs came on themarket last year? * Mr. RATHMANN. On the average each year there are between twoand three of such drugs. The CHAIRMAN. Of course, this is a very, very important break-through, is this correct? Mr. RATHMAN14 .WWe'rRe careful about that word, but yes, it is.The CHAIRMAN. You-hope that it is, all right? Mr. RATHMANN. OK. Now, if we turn to the.. discussions that we had with the-HealthCare Financing Administration, we electediover-a year ago to havethose discussions because we felt there wa& a lot, of information weneeded, andowere prepared to share. But there was also a very spe-cial circumstance because of the end-stage renal disease program.This particular drug, which will eliminate 300,000 transfusions.peryear, is tied primarily to that end-stage renal disease population.As a result of that, it was clear that there had to be some under-standing of the price tag for this drug. So we provided the back-ground information I just disclosed about investments, what thecost of those investments were, how long-they'd been going on, thatour company has been in business for 9 years, and this is our firstproduct. So the investment is extreme. In -fact, for that drug, if weallocate a portion of our investment, even, a reasonable portion, itcomes out to be substantially higher than the $100 million that hasbeen used here today. But it is a breakthrough drug.Now, there are a number of questions that have been raised.about what kinds of discussions we had with the Health Care Fi-nancing Administration. It was trulysdiscussionm We presented a-lotof information. They told us some of their concerns, some of theirways of measuring. They requested a lot of additional information;about what cost savings would be associated with Eposen. Whatwould be the benefits to the quality of care in this country. We dida thorough analysis over that year and provided them with the in-formation done both by our own surveys, and other firms. So theyhad a measure of just how valuable this product was- going to be.They had an opportunity to see .tapes of people that were on thedrug, physicians, leading world figures who could acknowledge theimportance of this drug, as well as looking at the cost effectivenessdata. And the Medicare people also felt that all cost information 31-352 0 -90 -8222 was important, even if it didn't directly impact the Medicare budget itself. And that was quite helpful. The CHAIRMAN. Could I ask you a question? Mr. RATHMANN. Sure, go right ahead. The CHAIRMAN. You negotiated with HCFA and you found those to be constructive, I guess. Mr. RATHMANN. Yes, we-- The CHAIRMAN. Ultimately-- Mr. RATHMANN. We avoided the word, negotiation. We felt that it was more appropriate to have information exchanged. The CHAIRMAN. All right. Have you ever had any discussions with the Veterans Adminis- tration? Mr. RATHMANN. In answer-if you'd let me pose -the question a little differently. How will our product be priced? It will have one price. We don't have any plan for the foreseeable future to have a differential pricing strategy. Now, it may be brought about by a competitive situation, and then we have to address that. But at the present time we have one price and that's the price. And that's why I say there wasn't exactly negotiation. We elected to establish our price before HCFA established their reimbursal. But we had a measure of how they were going to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this drug. The CHAIRMAk. I know absolutely nothing about all this, and I would admit it. But I would like to ask you a question because you've been in this community for awhile, and hopefully this drug is going to be a success and improve the quality of life of hopefully thousands, millions of Americans, or people worldwide. Were you surprised at any of the charts that you've seen today, for example about the variation of international prices, or this one showing when the patent expires on a brand name it keeps going up even after the generics have hit the market? Did any of this surprise you, or is this something that's pretty well known every- where? Mr. RATHMANN. The information that's least well known to our company is really with respect to the pharmacists. We have not been that acquainted with that part of the market. A lot of the other information has been examined by people in the company and we are aware of it. As a matter of fact-and some of these points were revealed to us in these discussions with HCFA. That was a great educational period. One of the issues that came up was international pricing. We provided all the data available and, in fact, the domestic pricing differential with the international price is much more favorable to the United States, in our case, than it is on those charts. The CHAIRMAN. I sort of took on the pharmaceutical manufactur- ers' Mr. Mossinghoff a little bit, because of the so-called tax breaks. I voted for all those. So I can't charge those against him. Mr. RATHMANN. Would you like to know our number? The CHAIRMAN. I voted for all those because I thought it would help in finding cures for some of the major diseases, illnesses that we have. And I have no apologies about it. I don't like, though, people saying, or not giving the taxpayer, or the tax code any credit for what we intended for them to do in the beginning. And223 that's where I have a little difference with my friend, Mr. Mos-singhoff. But I bet with you, now I'm not being critical, it's not critical,but with you, you probably helped develop this drug because of thetax breaks, or the subsidies? Mr. RATHMANN. I hate to disappoint you. In fact, we have not re-ceived any tax benefit from the R&D credit. Remember, we'relosing money right .up to right now, or just about breaking even.Tax benefits help the people that make money. They don't helpthat much until a company gets into a profitable position. I thinkwe have a credit of about $3.8 million that someday we'll be able touse as our profits reach that. point. So the tax implications werenot a factor in our thinking. And unfortunately, we're not an ex-ception here. We are an exception in some cases. We have to watchthat. But in the case of tax credits they're not as helpful to a start-up company. Remember, we started 9 years ago, and we have nosignificant profits during that entire time.The CHAIRMAN. They're more helpful to the established compa-nies? Mr. RATHMANN. Well, let's not be negative. I think it's an en-couragement to an established company to invest-in R&D and growtheir R&D. So it's a positive incentive for a good thing. It justdoesn't happen to help with startup.The CHAIRMAN. Did you have any other comments there, Mr.Rathmann? Mr. RATHMANN. I was going to address some .of the questionsthat had come up, and that was all.For example, a question that was raised, why dont -normalmarket forces operate? I think one of the things that has to be keptin mind besides all the. other factors that were raised in that dis-cussion, is with a- product like Epogen, the breakthrough products,if you want to call them that, there is no alternative therapy.There is a crushing need for this product, and there's no way of-measuring cost or price directly by. saying I'm going to substitutethis product for another product. It's>-very difficult -to make a pric-ing decision when the only alternative therapy is a much less satis-factory transfusion of blood at a very high level. And, in fact, eventransfusions don't restore the patient to the same state of health.Another question that came up, I thought I'd comment on, wasforeign competition. In contrast.to the picture you saw, where avery, very small penetration is from foreign companies, -the bio-technology industry in this country is threatened by very severeforeign competition. And the reason for that is the maturation ofour competitors overseas, and this is a new industry. New thingsgive an opportunity for changing market shares, and foreign com-petition could very drastically change its market share in thiscountry, and is targeting to do so. -And as of now, foreign competi-tion lurks just beyond our borders. Very, very shortly we couldhave competition for this product, because it. has been difficult forus to assert our patent position. And that's a serious problem. Andthat ties into patents as well. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rathmann follows:]224 AMOEN STATEMENT BEFORE THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING Presented By George B. Rathmann Chairman of the Board Amgen Inc. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am George Rathmann, Chairman of the Board of Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company located in Thousand Oaks, California. I am here today to share with you the very limited experience in drug pricing of perhaps the newest research- intensive manufacturer of prescription drugs. Amgen has one FDA-approved product which it has been marketing for only about six weeks. Since its founding in 1980, Amgen has been dedicated to the development of human pharmaceuticals using advances in recombinant DNA technology and molecular biology. On June 1, 1989, Amgen was granted a license by the Food and Drug Adminis- tration to manufacture and market its first pharmaceutical product, EPOGENM (Epoetin alfa), recombinant human erythro- poietin. On June 2, we began shipping EPOGEN\u00ae. In healthy adults, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney in response to changes in oxygen availability in the bloodstream. Erythropoietin travels to the bone marrow, where it stimulates cells in the marrow to mature into red blood cells which are released into the bloodstream. Red blood cells carry oxygen to, and carbon dioxide from, tissues and organs throughout the body. Since the kidney is the principal site of erythropoie- tin production in adults, renal insufficiency almost always results in anemia, or a shortage of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Of the 108,000 Americans receiving maintenance dialysis, more than 75% are anemic and an estimated 25% are so severely anemic that they require blood transfusions to survive. First cloned and developed by Amgen scientists, EPOGENO has the same amino acid sequence and biological effects as natural erythropoietin. The first clinical trials of EPOGENS were begun by Amgen in 1985. In the multicenter clinical trials that followed, EPOGENO proved effective in correcting anemia in over 95% of the patients treated, and it virtually eliminated the need for blood transfusions. EPOGENO therapy significantly increased patients' quality of life, including their energy and activity levels and capacity to exercise. It enabled some patients to return to work. The product was generally well-tolerated without serious adverse effects. Through the end-stage renal disease program, Medicare covers most of the costs of health care provided to patients on dialysis. Medicare therefore will be the principal payer for EPOGENG for patients on dialysis. While payment for EPOGENO will have an impact on the Medicare budget, this budget will realize significant offsetting economic benefits. In particular, the cost of blood transfusions and androgenic steroids, and the side effects and risks of these therapies (including AIDS and hepatitis), should be virtually eliminated, with significant savings to the Medicare program.225 In addition, the number of successful kidney trans- plants should increase. Patients who receive transfusions are at risk of developing antibodies which increase the incidence of kidney transplant rejection. Patients who will never have to receive a transfusion, because of EPOGERO, will not develop these antibodies. Therefore, we expect that more patients will be eligible for transplantation. Furthermore, preliminary reports indicate that the antibody levels of previously transfused patients may decline over time as they no longer receive transfusions. Additional areas of savings to the government are more difficult to quantify at this time, but early evidence suggests that, if their anemia is prevented, fewer patients will become unemployed when they begin dialysis. As many as 25% of patients on dialysis report that they cannot work because of fatigue, tiredness and lack of energy -- all of which are symptoms of anemia; which EPOGENG corrects. At one center participating in the Amgen clinical trials, 16% of patients were reported to have returned to work after EPOCENO therapy corrected their anemia, When a patient works, not only does the government collect increased tax revenue. but in many cases, disability payments are eliminated. y In 1985, Amgen licensed U.S. EPOGENM marketing rights to all indications except dialysis to Ortho Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The status of Ortho's U.S. marketing rights, if any, is the subject of a current arbitration proceeding. Rights to market EPOGEN\u00ae in foreign countries have also been licensed to other companies. Recognizing that approximately 90% of the patients in Amgen's retained market (ie., patients with end-stage renal -disease on dialysis) are Medicare beneficiaries, * Amgen approached the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in June 1988. to discuss coverage and reimbursement issues. over the course of the last year, Amgen and HCFA met frequently, reviewed available data, and prepared- numerous analyses of the clinical benefits and potential economic impact of EPOGENM therapy. On June 22, 1989, HCFA announced that, for at least the next six months, Medicare will pay dialysis facilities an additional $40 per dialysis session when EPOGENO is adminis- tered. -Prior to that announcement, in conjuction with FDA's approval of EPOGEN0, Amgen announced its price, $10 per 1,000 units. (In our clinical. trials, most patients received between 2,000 and J,000 -units, three times per week, depending on the patient's-weight and other factors.) Amgen understands the Committee's interest in drug pricing issues. In pricing EPOGENS, Amgen considered its historical investment in EPOGENS resea.ch and .development (including the cost of capital to.,fund.rthose efforts), its expected future expenditures, and thea7special characteristics of the dialysis marketplace. The .pricmaizmgen set is well below the current average worldwide price -or erythropoietin, which is approximately $14 per 1,000 units. Reports in the media have suggested that Amgen intends to reap unreasonable profits from the sale of EPOGENO, at the expense of the American taxpayer. In particular, one source has alleged that it costs Amgen $140 to manufacture a patient- Year's supply of theidrug, with the further inference that this -is Amgen's total cost...-ibis is grossly inaccurate. It is important to understand that the costs of bringing EPOGENO to patients include not only the costs of bulk manufacturing, but also the costs of other manufacturing steps, vialing, -packaging, product .liability insurance, distribution. continuing -research and-development- to improve the product, and perhaps most importantly,. the enormous investment.nnecessary to discover EPOGENS, test it,.- and bring it to market. In addition,. because EPOGENR is a completely new therapeutic entity, Amgen must provide extensive medical -education and medical information support for the product in order that physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals are properly informed about its use.226 The cost of bringing EPOGENS to market must also include the cost of the corporate infrastructure required to support the effort. Such costs include human resources, accounting, sales and marketing, and administration functions, as well -as general overhead costs. Furthermore, Amgen estimates that next year its combined federal and state tax rate will be approximately 40%. I would like to emphasize the need to include in the price of a new drug product a reasonable return to the manufacturers' investors. Over the course of its eight-year operating history, Amgen has spent approximately $338 million, primarily on research and development, including capital improvements. In fact, according to a Business Week survey of companies in the United States, Amgen ranks first in R&D dollars spent as a percent of sales (89.5%), as well as in R&D dollars spent per employee ($112,269). Business Week reported that Amgen invested more in research and development than any of its competitors: 729% more in 1988, and an average of 448% more over the past five years. Mr. Chairman, I would like the article from this special issue on 'Innovation in America' to be included in the record as part of my testimony. This significant investment in R&D has led to the development of two of the most promising, biotechnology products, EPOGENe and NEUPOGENTM. (NEUPOGEN , recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, is in Phase III clinical trials. NEUPOGENTM stimulates the production of the white blood cells that fight bacterial infections, and appears promising in its application' to patients with extremely low white blood cell counts brought on by chemotherapy.) Typically, in the hopes of identifying the handful of products that will be therapeutically valuable, a company must proceed with research and development for many products, only a few of which become commercially successful. Furthermore, it is necessary to incur the costs of developing basic technology which is essential to the development of therapeutic products. Therefore, the cost to develop a product such as EPOGENO necessarily includes the cost of basic technology as well as the cost of R&D on products which have not proven to be successful. The true cost of developing EPOGENS has been more than half of the company's total expenditure of $338 million. Approximately $185 million of the money to fund these extraordinary research and development efforts has been in the form of equity capital, much of which was invested at signifi- cant risk by investors who believed in the quality of the company's science and its management. Today the United States enjoys a clear lead in biotechnology. We are ahead of Europe and Japan in the research and development of new products from biotechnology. We have achieved this lead through the support of private capital. Unlike our foreign competitors, many of whom are supported by direct government subsidy, the U.S. biotechnology industry has been financed, almost exclusively by private capital. We are proud of our progress and ask for no subsidy from the government in any form. At the same time, in order to maintain our industry's lead, it is imperative that those who have invested in our industry be able to achieve a return on that investment. Unless Amgen achieves from EPOGEN\u00ae an adequate rate of return on these investments, it is unclear that Amgen, or other innovative biotechnology companies, will be able to access the capital markets to fund biotechnology research and development in the future. Without an adequate rate of return, investors will not continue to invest in this promising but risky area of new technology. I want to emphasize that, at this time in the history of biotechnology, investor anxiety is extremely high. Amgen's success or failure with EPOGENS will be extraordinarily important in investor thinking.227 Some of the risks associated with investing inbiotechnology companies fhave to do with..signif-icant-delays inachieving appropriate patent protection,. with -the potentialloss to -foreign countries of much of the-intellectual propertydeveloped by -our industry. We expect,-i for example, thatEPOGENS might have to- compete very soonr.with a Japanese-madeproduct, despite our -assertions in. court and before theInternational Tmade Commission that the Japanese company isviolating our patent. As I mentioned earlier, EPOGEN@ is Amgen's only humanpharmaceutical approved for sale. Apart from a small line ofbiologicals for the basic science research market, the companyhas no other products to sustain it as it continues efforts todevelop other 'breakthrough' products. At the same time, sinceEPOGENO is Amgen's only product, the degree of profitability from EPOGENO will be readily. apparent to Medicare, to theCongress, to all observers, from the company's audited finan-cial statements filed periodically with the Securities andExchange Commission. Taking into account these factors, Amgen has madeevery effort to balance its responsibilities to patients andsociety with its responsibilities. to employees and stockholdersin pricing its first product. We believe that we are sellingEPOGENO at a reasonable price, 30% below the price set by ourlicensee abroad. In summary, the experience of Amgen in pricing itsfirst pharmaceutical product has been uniquely affected bycharacteristics of the company and of its retained market. Ofparamount importance.in establishing a price for this producthas been the company's need to survive. Returning reasonablevalue to its investors is an essential element of that survival. Amgen also has taken seriously its obligation toinsure that patients who need EPOGENs will receive it as soonas possible. Discussions with HCFA centered on that goal, andon the government's obligation to conserve Medicare trustfunds. HCFA, like the FDA, gave recombinant erythropoietinhigh priority and acted rapidly and responsibly in making itpossible for patients to receive this valuable therapeutic. Amgen would have preferred a reimbursement methodologywhich created more incentives to provide adequate amounts ofEPOGENs to anemic patients, but we are pleased with the rela-Xtionships we have -developed at HCFA. We are hopeful thatinformation gathered over the next six months will suggest waysto fine tune the methodology as required to improve patientaccess. I appreciate -the opportunity to discuss theseimportant issues with this Committee. I would be happy 'toanswer any questions you may have.228 The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Rathmann, your Senator, Senator Wilson, is very sorry he could not be here with his constituent this afternoon. He wanted me to ask you this question. Given your company's experience in discussing reimbursement levels for its drug, Epogen, with the Health Care Financing Admin- istration, do you expect to have similar discussions in the future with respect to other products now in your research and develop- ment pipeline? Is this going to happen in the future? Mr. RATHMANN. Well, I suspect that we will have similar discus- sions on occasion. But certainly, this is a unique product for which this was really called for as a very important and necessary thing to anticipate. Where the Medicare participation would be a much less significant portion of how the drug would be financed, we prob- ably wouldn't do it. And as I understand it, if they were obligated to have as extensive discussion for every product that's introduced, I think'they'd probably have to be staffed many, many times great- er than they are. So, I suspect it's not practical.' I think it should be examined for every one, but I wouldn t want to say that we would do it every time. The CHAIRMAN. Also, Senator Wilson wanted you to state in the record some of the important therapeutics developed by biotechnol- ogy and what they have been to date, and I don't know if you want to do that now. Mr. RATHMANN. I can send you that information on other biotech drugs. There have been half a dozen, and they're all very impor- tant. This is probably one of the most important. [Subsequent to the hearing, the following information was re- ceived for the record:] Mr. Chairman, to date the American biotechnology industry has introduced nine products. These products have all made positive contributions to the healthcare of people not only in the U.S. but around the world. Those products, their introduction date, and their uses are as follows: Humulin, October 28, 1982, injectible insulin; Protropin, October 12, 1985, hypopituitary dwarfism; Intron A and Roferon A, June 4, 1986 hairy cell leukemia, Orthoclone OKT3, June 19, 1986, allograft rejection, Re- combiuax JB, July 23, 1986, hepatitis B vaccine, Humatrope, March 8, 1987 hypopi- tuitary dwarfism, Activase, November 13, 1987, thrombolysis, and EPOGEN\u00ae, June 1, 1989, chronic renal failure. The CHAIRMAN. Well, finally, I'll end this hearing, almost as I started off by asking one of our first witnesses, what's the role of the Government in all of this? Some people say hands off, free en- terprise, let the market place decide. What should we do? What do you think this committee should do? We're trying to be responsive to the elderly population and to all the population of the country. What should we do in this committee, what should we do in the Congress and the Government about some of these issues we've dis- cussed? Mr. RATHMANN. Well, obviously, you're attempting to under- stand, and that's the first step. And I think we all should work with you to help you understand as much as we know. And none of us understand it all. It's a matter of helping each other. -I think we all recognize that the burden of the health care of our population is a very significant part of our gross national product and the Government is a very significant player. I think it is im- portant, however, not to ignore quality. And one of the most diffi- cult issues is to factor in correctly the quality requirement along229 with some other easier measurement which is cost. I sense thatfrom this group- The CHAIRMAN. By the way, Senator Warner kept emphasizingquality this morning. I'd like to emphasize quality, and I certainlyagree with you. Mr. RATHMANN. Well, we're with you. If you can help, we will.The CHAIRMAN. Well, we just don't know quite where to go now,but I'll tell you we're going somewhere, and before long we're goingto have another hearing. I hope that you can talk to some of yourcolleagues who are in the pharmaceutical business, some of themanufacturers to convince them that we don't have horns, thatwe're looking for answers, that we hope that they will participatewith us in some of these future discussions.Mr. Rathmann, we thank you very much and we thank all of youvery, very much today as our witnesses.This committee is adjourned.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are as-sembled here today to continue this committee's examination ofthe prescription drug crisis which began-, whkkur first hearing onJuly 18 of this year. There is no question that we face a growing crisis in the UnitedStates due to rising prescription-drug prices. We are about to strikethe-new Medicare drug benefit from the catastrophic health insur-ance legislation because of rising drug costs. We are doing this atthe very time when drug costs represent the highest out-of-pockethealth care cost for three out of every four Americans.It is not just elder Americans who are suffering. State Medicaidprograms that serve the poorest Americans have struggled throughthis decade by chopping and chiseling at their drug coverage. TheStates have raised copayments, cut benefits, imposed coverage re-strictions, held down pharmacy reimbursements-in fact, theyhave done everything but get the drug manufacturers to stop rais-ing their prices at a rate which is three times faster than inflation.Medicaid drug spending is now over $3.3 billion a year, evenmore than we spend on doctors in that program. I am going toinsert a letter for the record from California State AssemblymenPhilip Isenberg and William Baker on what the State of Californiahas attempted to do to respond to the spiraling cost of drugs intheir Medicaid program. WmsR &PTMh3f November 14, 1989 Senator David Pryor, Chairman U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Room G31, Dirksen Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Senator Pryor: We are pleased indeed that your Committee is holding a special heartlg on the price of drugs purchased by state Medicaid programs. We belLove that the federal government and the various states can save millions of dollars every year by negotiating the pr.ce of drugs purchased for indigent health care, and we are trziang to do just that in California. Catifernia's Medi-Cal program buys $134 million annually worthof drugs on its formulary that are made by only one phrnaceutical manufactor. fedi-Cal pays list price for 222 such single source drugs. It receives no discount or rebate. But mcst other major health programs, such as the Veteran' aAdmnitistratiot, negotiate prices 20 to 80 percent less than Mlei-Cal pays for the same products. Some examples: LOWEST MEDI-CAL DRUG USE PRICE PRICE Lo-Overal Birth control pill $ 1.75 $14.53 Toiectin We estimate that the federal government and the state of California could save at least $40 million if the price wasne;otrated in return for being listed on the state's formulary. There is a substantial financial benefit to drug companies when one of their products is listed on the formulary. It means that doctors may prescribe these drugs without prior approval. Sales of the drug increase dramatically through Medi-Cal use, and physicians who become familiar with the drugthrough Medi-Cal prescriptions tend to prescribe the same drug- to their private-pay patients. Assemblyman Bill Baker (R-DanvrSle) introduced Assembly Bill 2148 earlier this year to authorize the California Department of Health Services to negotiate rebates from manufacturers of*single vource drugs.233 Under AB 2148, such drugs could not remain on the formulary unless the manufacturer agreed to pay a rebate within a 90-daynegotiation period. Among the factors to be considered by the state's rebate negotiators was the price paid by other large volumte purchasers. They also would have been required to consider the health needs of Nadi-Cal beneficiaries. Incredibly,-the drug manufacturers' main argument against AB 2148 went like this: One,.they Said, such a precedent in California could spread toother state Medicaid programs, Medicare and other insurance-type health programs. Two, widespread use of such rebates would have a major impact on drug pricing. Therefore, the drug manufacturers said, they would not agreeto pay rebates in order to keep a drug on the Medi-Cal formulary. The manufacturers also said there would be conflicts with state and federal anti-trust laws if AB 2148 was enacted. AB 2148 failed in its first committee- Under heavy pressure from the drug companies, it mustered only 4 votes. Later, Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sscramento) and Baker put a provision into an unrelated bill that would allow the Department of Health Services to use emergency regulations topull a drug off the formulary, effectively giving the department the hammer it needs to negotiate drug rebates. It remains to be seen if the department can use this authority. Certainly, we urge the department to use this power to negotiate single source drug prices. We believe the drug manufacturers' argument that California can lead the nation into dramatic taxpayer savings on publiclypurchased pharmaceuticals. Thank you for offering us this opportunity to comment for the record. Sincerely, ASSEEL PIL IS ASSLYMA BI/l. S AS~~gMBD PHIL IS ASSEMBLYMAN.BILL B&TYER234 The CHAIRMAN. I would like to quote from the letter, which is dated November 14, 1989. \"We believe that the Federal Govern- ment and the various States can save millions of dollars every year by negotiating the price of drugs purchased for indigent health care, and we are trying to do that in the State of California.\" The letter goes on to describe the negotiating process, involving the use of leverage due to the tremendous amount of drugs being purchased by the State's Medicaid program. I would also like to read two other sentences from this letter: \"Incredibly, the drug manufacturers' leading argument against Bill No. 2148 went like this: 'One,' said the drug manufacturers, 'such a precedent in California could spread to other State Medicaid pro- grams, Medicare and insurance type programs. Two, the use of widespread rebates would have a major impact on drug pricing.\"' The legislation, I might say, was defeated. But, that is neverthe- less exactly what we are attempting to do, to have a major impact on drug pricing, ultimately for the sake of the consumer, the States, and the Federal Government. That is what this hearing is about. The escalation of prices of prescription drugs is not over. In fact, it may be just beginning. Drug prices are now rising faster than almost any type of Medicaid spending, and Medicaid, with just one exception, is the fastest growing program in State budgets. But it is not just the poorest Americans who are suffering, and it is not just a problem for Government programs. It is a problem for people. It is a problem for people who have saved. It is a problem for people who have planned for their retirement years. We will hear from some of those this morning. Because of skyrocketing drug prices, ordinary citizens are going to extraordinary lengths to find less expensive drug treatment. Sometimes, they must spend their life savings for prescription drugs. People with AIDS in our country are now being pushed into buying their life-sustaining drugs from foreign countries. Now one of the companies that made the price of its drug so high is asking the U.S. Government Customs Service to seize these low-cost drugs at the border, so they can continue in their price escalation and profit increases. Why should anyone in America have to risk arrest to find a rea- sonably priced prescription drug to save their life? It is our respon- sibility to find a way to get drug costs down to a reasonable level. We should look at what other governments are doing abroad to keep drug costs low. We will be doing just that today. We also will look to see what the smartest people in the private sector in America are doing to lower drug prices. Our witnesses today are going to help us find some solutions to this crisis of affordability of prescription drugs. First, however, I would like to address the drug companies, the pharmaceutical manufacturers' latest attempt to muddy the waters on this issue. Yesterday, each member of this Committee received from the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association a letter stat- ing a purported attempt to rebut the Committee's majority staff report that was released at our last hearing.235 I would like to say that I stand by that report. I think it is inter-esting to note that the drug manufacturers failed to mention in,Vtheir latest information to the Committee that they spent almosthalf of their research. and development budget on \"me-too\" drugs.Here's what a former drug company executive, then an invest-ment analyst on Wall Street, told the Washington Post only lastyear: \"A typical drug firm currently spends 15 to 20 percent of itsresearch dollars on high-risk investigation of breakthrough prod-ucts, 30 percent on developing improved versions on existing drugs,and the balance, somewhere between 50 and 55 percent, on so-called 'me-too' drugs, proprietary versions of drugs that are on themarket and that have been successful.\" I might add that these are high-profit items.Recently another former drug company executive had his speechappear in a publication, entitled.Vital Speeches of the Day. In thatspeech, this former executive said \"Senator Kefauver was worriedabout administered prices. These are administered markets. Thereis nothing efficient about them. This is the reason so much of theR&D in industry is directed at increasing profits, not discoveringproducts. In some market segments, most of the research is aimedat getting or keeping a piece of a large, profitable market withoutoffering any new therapeutic advantage. Regulators have been out-foxed and out-financed.\" I could go on and on this morning with further revelations, but Ibelieve everyone knows what the prescription drug industry cannotafford to admit. We can -and we should and we must use our lever-age to bargain over the price of \"me-too\" drugs. I look forward totoday's witnesses, who will tell us how to do it, and how to do itright. Ladies and gentlemen, also let me announce, if I might, that weare going to have an interesting follow-on meeting on this issue at1:30 this afternoon in this room. We are going to set up a big tablehere, and any and all participants here today-witnesses, Senators,staffs, panelists, drug company representatives, the press-andanyone who desires to come are going to have a round table discus-sion on where we are and what we need to do.It will be off the record. We hope that it will be informal to theextent that we can all let our hair down. We have never tried any-thing like this before, but once again, we extend an invitation toall of you to join us, to listen, to add your two cents worth, and toparticipate. Especially- the drug companies, who I cannot get to tes-tify, in a formal setting, possibly might come and answer some ofthe questions about why drug prices are escalating at the rate theyare today. That will be at 1:30 in this room. We have our vice chairman with us here, Senator Heinz. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN HEINZ Senator HEINZ. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I com-mend you for .not only holding this important hearing, but twovery timely and critical hearings in a row. The one yesterday wason- a different kind of drug problem, illegal drugs, and this one ofcourse deals with legal and literally life-saving drugs.236 The CHAIRMAN. Well, let me interject. The hearing yesterday was on illegal drugs, today's it is on immoral prices of prescription drugs. Senator Heinz, I hated to interrupt. Senator HEINZ. But you couldn't resist. The CHAIRMAN. I could not resist. Senator HEINZ. And those drugs are of critical importance to 31 million-in this case, certainly law-abiding-elderly Americans. I think it is important to recognize that as we meet here, Congress is on the threshold of repealing the first prescription drug benefit ever enacted, the benefit that is part of the catastrophic coverage that we enacted last year. Clearly we are rolling backward in this area, rather than for- ward. While Congress may feel snakebitten with catastrophic cov- erage overall, I think in terms of prescription drug benefits, that feeling is only temporary. I think out of this hearing, as Senator Pryor has suggested, we can develop some promising initiatives and measures that will hold down drug costs while assuring that there is access to safe prescription drug use, when needed. Most Americans are aware of the chronic conditions, including hypertension, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, that are the con- stant companions of aging, and require the constant regulation of prescription medications. The elderly who depend on those drugs to relieve painful or un- pleasant symptoms, to improve the quality of their lives and main- tain their independence, may take up to 14 different prescriptions during the course of a year to treat one or more conditions. Unfor- tunately, over half of those who use prescription drugs regularly have no insurance coverage for that type of expense, and they are very vulnerable to skyrocketing costs. As we learned in the process of drafting the prescription drug benefit for the catastrophic coverage bill, three out of four seniors reported that their out-of-pocket expenses for drugs took by far the biggest bite out of their health care pocketbook. Many are forced to factor those costs into their family budgets, where they compete with .dollars needed for food, clothing, and heating costs. In the end, people literally often decide they are going to go without the medication they need, because they simply can't afford it. One of my constituents, from Selinsgrove, PA, recently wrote to me that she takes four prescription medications daily, and each has increased in price by 10 percent or more in recent months. For a family on a limited income, 10 percent more for a drug bill that could be running $125 or maybe more a month, means cutting 10 percent from what is left after paying rent and taxes, which means taking 10 percent off food and clothing budget, or worse, not taking the medication. I think this hearing is timely; I almost want to make a plea to our colleagues. As we go through the process of dismembering the Catastrophic Coverage Act, which-is flawed in many respects, and does need a substantial revision, that we pull from the.ashes of that program one very important element: the drug review screen. The advantages of the drug utilization review element are well known. They, include access to a comprehensive record of a pa- tient's treatment program and built-in alerts to notify a pharma-237 cist of allergies or potential adverse drug interactions. We knowthat is possible since some drug chains offer such a service now.The Inspector General recently estimated that a drug utilizationsystem could save $4.5 billion a year in avoidable hospital costs aswell as thousands of lives, just by keeping seniors from being over-medicated, or inappropriately medicated. That's the particular kindof cost savings I want to talk about. Mr. Chairman, again I congratulate you on this hearing. I lookforward to the testimony of our witnesses here today.The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Heinz.Senator Reid. -STATEMENT OF SENATOR HARRY REID Senator REID. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for provid-ing members of this committee with an opportunity to further ex-amine the current crisis of prescription drug costs.I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the group ofwitnesses who are lending their valuable time and testimony to ushere today. It seems likely that the prescription drug coverage in the Medi-care Catastrophic Act will not go into effect, as Senator Heinz hasexplained. The need to stop rising drug costs, therefore is all themore urgent. The first panel of witnesses will offer testimony thatis all too familiar to me. I receive many, many letters recounting the horror of steep andsteady drug price increases, price increases that force people to gowithout a week's worth of necessary medicine, or without meals atthe end of the month. Mr. Chairman, I would like to share a bit of one of these letterswith you and the other members of this committee. This letter isaddressed to me. Dear Senator, I am 86 and my wife is 80. Both \"headed south,\" of course-older.We have been relatively fortunate so far, but worry every day about going absolute-ly broke, should luck forsake us for long. Our biggest expense now, surprisingly tous, is prescription drugs. We challenge them every one, and take turns skipping orrefusing to use one or so at a time. Some luck. Doctors are prone, as we know, todish out the pills. We fight it. But in 1988, our drug bill ran close to $2,000. The prices boggle our minds. Maybethat needs looking into, also. We work all the angles, we are members and users ofAARP, etc. It is still frightening. I won't read the rest of the letter, from this individual fromBoulder City, NV. I think it speaks volumes for why we are heretoday. I am hopeful that perhaps some of the negotiations that myfriends from Boulder City have been doing with their own budget,drug purchases and physicians can be done by those who sell themdrugs. Those testifying here today have had various experiences in bar-gaining for lower drug prices. I trust we will learn something fromthose successes and failures and move closer to bringing down thecost of prescription drugs. Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Reid, thank you.Senator Cohen.238 STATEMENT OF'SENATOR WILLIAM COHEN Senator COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I do have an opening- statement which I would like your permission to submit for the record. I would say -that all of us, along with Senator Reid, have received poignant letters from powerless people. That is why this hearing is so particularly important, to see if -we can at least explore what al- ternatives may be available. I also want to commend the staff. That study that was done was truly staggering, in terms of its revelations. I am not sure whether it amounts.to price fixing on the part of some, but it comes close to it, in my judgment. So I will reserve my comments until we hear from the witnesses. [The prepared statement of Senator Cohen follows:]239 OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING November 15, 1989 Mr. Chairman, I commend you for convening this hearing. It is clear that you are determined to be thorough in your Committee's work on issues relating to prescription drugs. The hearing on prescription drugs that the Aging Committee held earlier this year was very successful in raising issues of con- cern to the nation's consumers -- especially elderly consumers since it is they who are most in need of and dependent on prescription drugs. I am sure that this hearing will yield comparable progress toward getting the nation's taxpayers more for their tax dollars spent on prescription drugs. As the recent analysis by the staff of this committee points out, the cost of prescription drugs is the fastest growing com- ponent of state spending on Medicaid, which is itself one of the most rapidly rising components of state budgets. During its previous fiscal year, Maine's Medicaid program spent $26.7 mil- lion for prescription drugs. State officials estimate that this year the program will spend more than $30 million. Rising prescription drug expenditures has prompted Maine to plan the establishment of a formulary commission for the purpose of devis- ing a system for controlling these costs. I am certain, therefore, that concerned parties in my state will be very inter- ested in the findings of this Committee. Mr. Chairman, again, I commend you on holding this hearing and for your efforts to shed light on the important issues relevant to prescription drugs.240 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cohen. Not all of the people in our country who are affected by the high prices of prescription drugs are what you'would call poor. Some of those individuals are those who have planned, saved, worked hard for their retirement years. Also, there are those who depend specif- ically on unique drugs that cost a tremendous amount of money. These drugs continue in their price escalation. We are going to hear from two witnesses today who I think fit well into that category. The first is Mr. Jake Green, from Winches- ter, KY. Mrs. Leona Bivens, from Seal Beach, CA, is our second witness. Our third witness on this panel is Mr. Derek Hodel who is the executive director of the People with AIDS Health Group, in New York City. Mr. Green, we are going to ask you first to make your statement. I have read your statement, and find it very interesting. I know we will all be interested in hearing what you have to say, because you represent a large number of Americans, and I know you will be speaking for them today. Thank you for coming. STATEMENT OF JAKE GREEN, WINCHESTER, KY Mr. GREEN. It is an honor and a privilege to be invited by Sena- tor Pryor to address -this Special Committee on Aging. This is in regard to the high prices of medication. My name is Jake Green, and I am 75 years old. I am retired and living on a fixed income. My problem is that I was diagnosed in the beginning of 1987 as having Myasthenia Gravis. To control my ill- ness, I take 16 pills of Mestinon, 60 milligrams each tablet, each day. That adds up to 500 pills per month. The price at the time was $65 for 500 pills at the drug store in Winchester, KY. On January 21, 1988, the price was raised to $72. Then, on July 29, 1988, I found the price went to $106 for the same~pills. I heard about the Myasthenia Gravis Associatkrion -of Western Pennsylvania, located in Pittsburgh, PA. i was notified by them that I could obtain Mestinon through -their- pill bank for $40 per 500 by mail. I joined the organization. in January 1989. By June .10, 1989, I was notified by the Myasthenia Gravis Asso- ciation that some drastic changes had taken place. Hoffman- LaRoche, the manufacturer of Mestinon, hadrsold the distribution -to ICN Pharmaceuticals of California. ION,- the-new distributor, had-chosen not to offer special contract prices to the chapter pill bank. Therefore, as of July 1, 1989, the price at the Western Pennsylva- nia Drug Bank, as well as throughout the whole country, is a great deal more expensive. Now the price has doubled to $87 per 500 pills, which- last 1 month. At the drugstore in Winchester, you have to pay $136 per 500 pills. While I was preparing this speech, I was notified that as of December 1, 1989, the price of Mestinon will in- crease another 8 percent. Adding this to $87 brings the total to around $93.96 per 500 pills, which still last me only 1 month. When are these increases going to stop, and what is the reason for them? I am not pleading poverty, and I am not asking for char- ity. But I am very much concerned, because I am at their mercy.241 There is no generic drug to take its place since Myasthenia Gravisis a rare neuromuscular disease, for which there is no cure, butMestinon is the most effective drug to help control it.I am very much concerned about how one company can controlthe price to their own advantage, without any regard for an esti-mated 120,000 to 150,000 people with the same illness that I have.To be honest with you, I fear the day when I will not be able topurchase the medicine which is keeping me alive. I hope that thisinformation I have given today about the existing problem ofunfair drug prices by the pharmaceutical companies can be reme-died. Not one of us in this room is immune from any disease.It should be our right as an American citizen to have availablefor any illness medicine which will enable us to live out our livesas best, and as humanely as possible. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Green, thank you for your very eloquentstatement before the Special Committee on Aging. All of us appre-ciate it. We are going to allow the other members of the panel to maketheir statements, and there may be a question or two that we haveabout your particular situation. Mrs. Leona Bivens of California is 73, and she has Parkinson'sdisease. For that condition, she must take Eldepryl, a drug that haslong been available in Europe. It was recently introduced in theUnited States at about twice the price that Europeans pay.We would like to hear your story, and we appreciate yourcoming, especially from such a long distance. STATEMENT OF LEONA BIVENS, SEAL BEACH, CA Mrs. BIVENS. Thank you, Senator Pryor and members of the com-mittee, for asking me to come here today. I want to tell you about the difficulty that so many of my friendsand I who have Parkinson's disease, have, in paying the high costof prescription drugs. I am 73 years old and widowed for almost 1 year. I have Parkin-son's disease. I have had Parkinson's disease for 13 years. I livealone in a retirement community in Seal Beach, CA. I have a care-giver who comes in 5 days a week, for 4 hours a day.The caregiver helps me with shopping, bathing, and dressing.She prepares my meals and does my laundry. She is my friend, shehelps me by being a sounding board for my problems.I am ambulatory, but I do not leave the house alone. I have awalker for inside the house, and have borrowed a wheelchair to useoutside as needed. In 1976, when I was 60 years old, I was given a drug called Sine-met, which is a combination of carbidopa and L-dopa. \"I wascured,\" almost as if by magic. It relieved the symptoms which hadplagued me for almost a year. These symptoms were slowness ofmovement and a difficulty in initiating movement, and a restingtremor of my right hand. I was so grateful. I continued working until I was 68 years old. Iworked as a cardiac nurse-technician. This extra time gave me an242 opportunity to save additional money for my retirement. I felt happy to know that I was able to care for myself. As is usual with L-dopa therapy, the drug -became ineffective. The so-called \"L-dopa honeymoon\" was over, and I had to look for other drugs to control the .symptoms .which had returned. I tried many anticholinergic drugs a and. dopamine agonists, but none worked. In June 1989, the Food and Drug Administration approved Elde- pryl for marketing as an adjunct therapy for those-mwho had had the Sinemet failure. They said that Eldepryl was for use in con- junction with Sinemet. One month ago, my neurologist started me on Eldepryl. I started to improve, and I continue to improve, but at what cost? I thought I had-a-good retirement plan, but how long can I pay the druggist's bill? Before I started taking Parlodel and Eldepryl, my drug bill was 54 cents a day. It has risen to almost $3 a day. That is with the Seal Beach Health Plan which pays 70 percent for prescription drugs, but which I cannot take advantage of if I have to leave the community. But if I do not have the -prescription drug benefit insurance, the cost will go to $9.62 a day. With other prescription drugs, which I must use and need daily, the cost of drugs will go to $3,800 a year. I have friends who have bought their drugs on the black market (from Italy and Hungary). I have two sons who are police officers, and I've taught them to live by the law. I prefer to live by the law, and I prefer to have the protection of the FDA, so that I know that the drugs are safe and efficacious. I am not sure what they would be if I were to buy them from some other place. With the- recent scandals in the generic drug industry, I am afraid to take generic drugs. However, the Eldepryl and Sinemet do not fall in this category. I am frightened now, because I am getting to the place where I should not live alone. My son has urged me to live with him. But if I go to live with him, I won't have my prescription drug benefit in- surance, and I don't know what I will do. Every day the cost seems to go up-$2.50 is what is projected as the cost of one 5 mg. Elde- pryl tablet and the recommended dose, which is safe, is two per day. But as I continue to take it, they may find out that we need more medication. How will we be able to pay the increasing costs of the drug? I'm really mad about the price of Eldepryl. Why does Somerset Pharmaceutical Laboratories need to charge such a high price for a drug where to ongoing research is partly subsidized by N.I.H. and where the company gets tax breaks for marketing an \"orphan drug\", and has exclusive distributorship for 7 years? These drugs allow us to be independent and to cut down on the amount of long-term care which we might require. Sometimes I think the worst thing that can happen to you is to grow old and depend on other people for your care. Thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. We need an advocate, and we are counting on you.243 The CHAIRMAN. Mrs. Bivens, thank you very much. We are allvery grateful. We know the trip you made was a long and hard onefor you. Have you ever testified before a committee before?Mrs. BIVENS. No, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. We are very grateful that you would come andmake this your initial performance. Let me say to Mr. Green, so you will know, Mr. Green, when yougo to your pharmacist to buy Mestinon, don't blame that pharma-cist for the cost of that drug going up. That pharmacist there inyour home town in Kentucky has no control over that. What thatpharmacist is doing is merely having to pass those increases on toyou, the consumer, and on to the Government. But just so you will know, since 1980 the price of Mestinon, thedrug that you depend on for your life, has gone up 260 percent,since 1980. I call this immoral. Mr. Derek Hodel is our next witness. 'Mr. Hodel is from NewYork. He wants to visit with us a few moments this morning to tellus about the organization he is involved with in New York, and theprescription drug known as aerosol pentamidine. It sells today for$26 in England; here in the United States it sells for somewherebetween $120 and $150. I think you have an interesting story to tell, and the Committeewould like to hear it. STATEMENT OF DEREK HODEL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PEOPLE WITH AIDS HEALTH GROUP, NEW YORK, NY Mr. HODEL. Thank you, Senator. We brought two display charts. I would like to ask that they bedisplayed at this time. My name is Derek Hodel and I am the executive director of thePeople with AIDS Health Group in New York City. The HealthGroup is what is commonly referred to as a buyer's club. It wasfounded by people with AIDS to help people acquire promisingtreatments that they cannot otherwise obtain. Consider this drug, aerosol pentamidine, which is generally soldin the United States at a retail price of approximately $150. InEngland, the retail price for this version of aerosol pentamidine,while medically the same, is $26. Because of the high U.S. price,many of those in need of this treatment simply do without.Aerosol pentamidine is approved by the FDA as a highly effec-tive preventive of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or PCP, whichremains the leading cause of death among people with AIDS. Pent-amidine is manufactured in the United States by Lyphomed andhas been designated by the FDA as an orphan drug.Because pentamidine is an orphan drug, the FDA must generallywait 7 years after approval of Lyphomed's application to marketpentamidine before it approves any other manufacturer's applica-tion to market the drug. During that period, Lyphomed can sellpentamidine, which is not patented, without any price restrictions.According to House committee reports, this \"market exclusivitywas intended to be an incentive to develop orphan drugs with little244 or no commercial value.\" I The House committee concluded that \"even with the benefits of the Orphan Drug Act, orphan drugs are not expected to be profitable.\" 2 As Chart 1 shows, Lyphomed's wholesale price for the drug in 1984 was $25. Since then, as demand surged, Lyphomed has raised its wholesale price almost 400 percent, to $99.54. Lyphomed has re- fused to reveal the financial basis for its price for pentamidine or its profits on the drug. Public information, however, strongly suggests that those sales are highly profitable.- Analyses project pentamidine sales in the United States of $70 million in 1989 and $100 million in 1990. Thus, profits for Lyphomed. Some people with AIDS, unable to pay the U.S. price, have sought to obtain prescriptions for pentamidine, have them filled abroad, and import the drug. This process is arduous and difficult, whether undertaken indi- vidually,. or with assistance from an organization. Lyphomed has complained that it is unlawful.3 In September 1989, the Federal Centers for Disease Control report 109,167 cases of full-blown AIDS in the United States. Chart 2 shows that 11,163 of these cases, orslightly more than 10 percent, were men and women age 50 and over. The Health Group does not keep detailed records of its clients, but I offer here my recollection of two persons who need pentamidine. The woman I will call Carmen is about 50 years old and is a single mother. She carries HIV, the -virus believed to cause AIDS, and is a patient at a city hospital -clinic. Though Carmen -is em- ployed, she is uninsured. Clinic doctors have advised her that she is at risk for PCP,- but the hospital, is. not yet equipped to administer .pentamidine. They gave her a prescription for the drug, and sug- gested that she. purchase a $200 nebulizer to administer it at home. Social workers often advise persons in Carmen's position that if they cannot afford the prescription, they should leave their jobs so that they will qualify for Medicaid. Carmen remained at work, but for 3 months she simply kept the prescriptions in her handbag. The man I will call Roger is about 63 years old and is employed. Within a few years he will be eligible to retire with a pension. Roger is HIV positive, and while he is well enough to work, his T- -Cell count is slow enough to warrant PCP prophylaxis. Roger fears that if he files a health insurance claim for pentamidine, his em- ployer will suspect that he has AIDS and fire him. Instead, Roger has been using his savings to purchase the drug at.a pharmacy. The problems revealed by the pentamidine situation are system- ic. Pricing problems have also arisen, for example, with AZT, an- -other orphan drug used- to treat people with AIDS. James Mason, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, recently felt compelled to urge publicly that in pricing AIDS drugs, drug manu- facturers should be more socially responsible. 'H. Rep.

So far as we are aware, Ly- phomed has not announced details of the program or distributed any pentamidine under it.245 When drug manufacturers can and do charge exorbitant pricesfor desperately needed drugs, particularly orphan drugs, for whichmanufacturers receive special exclusivity, substantial tax credits,and in certain cases development grants from the Government, wethink the system has gone radically awry.Thank you for your attention.

Senator Pressler. STATEMENT OF SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER Senator PRESSLER. Mr. Chairman, I- will place my statement in the record, but I did want to say thank you for holding this hearing on the pricing of prescription drugs. It is a subject that I believe needs examination because of its potential to adversely affect the health status of the poor and elderly. Now is the time to examine the dramatic affect pricing practices are having on access to pharmaceutical services for the aged and poor. This hearing has brought forth many indications of what I think are abuses in the pricing. There are many-examples from South Dakota. A pharmacist who is an inspector for the Board of Pharmacy in South Dakota writes, \"Pharmacists are Sighting for survival,, especially in the small towns, and more are closing each year.\" He goes on to cite some of the specific examples. An elderly woman has written to me, she is on a fixed income, and notes that her one medication has increased almost $5 in less than 6 months. She questioned the pharmacist thinking he .had made. a mistake, it is the pharmaceutical -companies, not the local pharmacist, that is the problem. Another drug has increased by 42A percent in less than 2 years. The drug is called Ogen. This is oneewample that many constitu- ents and pharmacists tell me about-iftyheir correspondence. Price increases like this can no longer be tolerated. The effect will be un- affordable drugs for the elderly and poor. What could possibly be driving the price-of drugs upward? I un- derstand the pharmaceutical manufacturers give away millions of dollars worth of prescription medications each .year. The cost of promoting a product is passed on, to the consumer. A pharmacist, who worked for a large drug manufacturer, found that the cost of giving one package of -four sample pills away was almost the same as producing a bottle of the-same pills which could be sold to a. pharmacy for $30 or $40. Mr. Chairman, I think we are seeing abuses in the sale .of drugs. I think the price many senior citizens pay are excessive, unexplain- able increases. I think that if the companies do not respond with a better explanation that it is time for Congress to act in the area of pricing legislation or antitrust legislation. It may well be that we need new legislation in this whole area. [The prepared statement of Senator Pressler follows:] Mr. PRESSLER. I want to thank the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee for convening this-hearing on the pricing of prescription drugs. This.is a subject that I believe needs examination because of its potential to adversely affect the health249 status of the poor and elderly. Now is the time to examine the dramatic affect pric- ing practices are having on access to pharmaceutical services for the aged and poor. I am pleased that the earlier hearing in June has led to this second hearing on the pricing of prescription drugs.Pricing practices discriminate against the retail pharmacy, the elderly and the poor. The increasing cost of prescription drugs are a threat to the viability of the small town pharmacy. A pharmacist who is an inspector for the Board of Pharmacyin South Dakota writes \"pharmacists are fighting for survival, especially in the small towns and more are closing each year. I am sure I could not sell my store if I had it today. There are a lot of them out there that aren't going to make it.\" Where will the rural elderly go for medication if the retail pharmacy closes its doors?The closure of retail pharmacies is only one of the problems that could adverselyaffect the health status of the elderly. A second is the dramatic price increases that the elderly, who use prescription drugs, are asked to absorb sometime more than once each year. An elderly woman, on a fixed income, noticed that her one medica-tion had increased almost $5.00 in less than six months. She questioned the pharma- cists, thinking he may have made a mistake. The pharmacist's comment was that \"Abbott Pharmaceutical Company raises their prices twice a year and this cost re- flected the last increase.\" The drug from Abbott is Ogen (OH-jun). The price on Ogen has increased by 42.4 percent in less than two years. This is one example that many constituents and pharmacists tell me about in their correspondence. Price in- creases like this can no longer be tolerated. The affect will be unaffordable drugs for the elderly and poor. What could possibly be driving the price of drugs upward? I understand that pharmaceutical manufacturers give away millions of dollars worth of prescriptionmedications each year. The cost of promoting a product is passed on to the con- sumer. A pharmacist who worked for a large drug manufacturer found that the cost to the manufacturer of giving one package of four sample pills away was almost thesame as for them to produce a bottle of the same pills which they could sell to a pharmacy for $30 to $40 for retail sale. That was due to packaging costs, govern- ment regulation and distribution by salesman. I question whether the benefits war- rant the cost to the public. Could the cost of drugs be reduced by discontinuing this practice? The practice of competitive bidding and volume discounts has allowed hospitals and other health organizations to obtain a discount on the price of drugs. That is a practice which allows those institutions to distribute prescription drugs at a reason-able price. If this practice is not practical for the retail pharmacists, then other means need to be explored in order to reduce the climbing prices and allow the poor and elderly to continue to have access to drugs that benefit their health.I would like to make this statement and letters from constituents' part of the record.250 Western Hills Home Health CAREQUIPMENT & L.V. Therapy 5th Street, Suite ItO, Rapid City, SD 57701 Telephone: 34t-CARE * Tolt Free: 1-800-658-CARE * FAX 605-341-2273 Dear Senator Pressler; In response to your letter of August 17, 1989 concerning prescription drug prices. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of correct information you have gathered. To be honest I did not think anyone had as true a grasp-on the facts as you have. I am a Pharmacist practicing in an independent pharmacy in Rapid City, SD. I have been in practice for 12 years. The large mail order out of state services are taking a lot of business and money out of the state. The most discourging aspect of this is the fact that some employer's insurance companies require their employees to send for their prescription needs to contracted pharmacies out of South Dakota (IE. Federal Govt. Retire Employees). Non-profit hospitals are redirecting inventories to connected businesses to be used to supply outpatient needs. The outpatient use should not be allowed , as I understand the Robinson Patman Act. Since you are aware of the fact that independent pharmacies do not enjoy any of these various discounts you can see the future of the independent pharmacies in rural South Dakota and the potential problems related to health care for all ages. I feel the pharmaceutical manufacturers will have to be regulated before any true discrepancy in pricing will be stopped. They are the one entity that controls the prices. The areas I feel that should be regulated are: 1. Pharmaceutical manufacturers give millons of dollars worth of prescription medication samples each year. These dollars lost must be made up in the prices charged to pharmacies purchasing their products. It is an unnecessary practice that is not only warping the cost of a product but can and has in the past lead to black market drug diversion. 2. Pharmaceutical manufacturers should not be allowed to offer such wide price discounts, period. The fewer exceptions, the fewer loop holes. .- 3. Pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to monitor anysgroup Zeceiving discounts to be sure they are not being used or diverted into areas not qqalified for these price discounts. If the paper work is so complicated perhaps theiy will think twice about offering as many discount accounts. I Thank You for your time and allowing me to share my concerns with you. I Mope this letter will show you the type of support you'll enjoy on these topics.251 924 No. Union Ave. Madison, So.Dak. 57042 Senator Pressler: In response to your letter addressed to So. Dak. Pharmacists-i Yes, prices of some prescrintion drugs are exoriTltar HoweveF7rthe diff erentfiation of acquisition costs to small independent pharmacies relative to urban and large company costs is hardly the reag~n. I have been on both ends of the spectrum. There is a problem, however, with price discrimination between retail pharmacies vs. \"non profit\" organ izations (e.g.almost every hospital in South Dakota qualifies). There you would find acquisition costs varying up to 99%. The retail pharmacy consumer picks up the Slack for the same drugs that are virtually given to these \"non profit\" institutions. Another significant factor is the practice of drug sampling by manufa cturers. Having worked for the USAs largest drug manufacturer at one time, I found that the cost to the manufacturer of giving one package of 4 sample pills away, was almost the same as for them to produce a bottle of the same pills (#100) which they would sell to a pharmacy for $30 to $40 for retail sale. That was due to packaging costs, government regulation, and distribution (salesmen). Does the benefits warrant the cost to the public? I think not. How much could drug costs be pared if this practice was discontinued? A lot. (The practice also contributes to drug diversion.) Yes, the exorbitant costs are due to manufacturers prices. The attitude that seems to prevail is \"why charge 50\u00a2 per capsule when we could just as well charge the pharmacy $1.50. After all, we don\"t have to face the ultimate consumer anyways.\" There is absolutely NO financial competition among manufacurers. Larry, that lack of competition leads to another industry p blem. Wha- a coincidence that at the same time that the US Senate is T4nally hinting that an investigation might ensue, an offensive is beginnift to discredit all generic drugs. I think it is a result of the original-manufacturers scheme \"Lets strike fear into the hearts of consumers that generic drugs' are no good'. I would bet my bottom dollar that the timig is no coin cidence. For once, a little competition for drug manufagturers from generic. firms, and THEY DONT LIKE IT. Of course there are shady people and shady companies in every field, and those in generi CZ anufacturing should be policed and punished. But there are shag people among PMA (Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn.) members also. PMA members simply do not like financial competition and seek to eliminate it.In what other industry besides drug manufacturers, do companies react to competition for their product by raising their prices? DRASTICALLY? When the drug Dyazide went generic, the original manufacturer responded by drastically raising their price. Does that make sense? They must not believe in competing financially. Larry, in my mind, this is the biggest ripoff-in pricing of drugs. I could go on and on about this topic. But, skimming the surface, this is where a cleanup should begin. I writie tbla for yourprivate information not for publication. Thanks.1 252 1505 Edgewood Road Sioux Falls. S. D. August 16, 1989 Dear Sehiato? Pressler, I read with interest the article in last Saturday's Argus Leader concerning your plan to ask for hearings on the pricing of prescri tion drugs. I applaud you for It was just a month ago, after having a prescription refilled, that I was angered and upset to find that the cost of this medication had increased almost $5.00 since I had last had it filled in March. I thought this was terribly out-of-line and questioned the pharmacist about a possible mistake in marking the price.. He had little comment other than to say that Abbott Pharmaceutical Comp- any raises their prices twice a year and this cost reflect- ed the last increase. It seems to me that an up-scaling of this magnitude is gouging the customer and is grossly unfair to the consumer whether a senior citizen or younger person. If the trend continues, the escalating cost of good health and staying well will affect every one of us and will be- come an unaffordable burden to many. What a frustrating and discouraging situation to those who are dependent upon_ a number of daily medications to maintain healthful livingr Enclosed is a record of two prescriptions I take daily as\"health maintenance therapy\". The Ogen(from Abbott) is the drug that has increased so rapidly in price... 42.4%- in less than two years. This is an incredible amount: The Tenormin shows a 11.1% increase in less than two years; but without a recent jump, I expect the next refill will X be more expensive. I hope these figures will be helpful in your investi- gation of drug prices to South Dakota consumers. Thank you for your concern in trying to find a solution to this costly and continuing problem. I hope the hearings will produce positive results. two prescription drug medications Pharmaceutical Company) #100 tablets A~6hI~ Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your study on the highcost of prescription drugs. e- . I have practiced pharmacy in a variety of settings including a smallindependent pharmacy, chain store, clinic pharmacy, and hospitalpharmacies. It has always amazed me as to the pricing structureprovided by the pharmaceutical manufacturers given the type ofpharmacy involved. In the retail pharmacy, I usually dealt withwholesale vendors as opposed to purchasing direct from themanufacturer. In the majority of cases, the wholesaler provided avery competitive pricing structure. I did find though that I couldnever compete with the hospital pricing structure given theiradvantage as you noted with the Nitro-Dur example. I also noted thathospitals did not pass the savings on to their patients but that thepharmacy helped pay for other services within the hospital settingthat did not add to the overall income. An example is patienteducation. This service is usually provided but no charge is made. There-are two issues that always caused me frustration and I wouldlike to share these. The first is that pharmaceutical manufacturerscan always raise their price for whatever reason, but they never haveto face-the patient who relies on their product. When Pfizer orUpjohn raised the price of Diabenese or Orinase, they did not have toface the patient when the prescription price was raised but I did.This is not an easy task. The second is related to chain storepharmacies such as Osco, Walgreen, Shopko and others. Thesepharmacies sell many items at cost or at a very small profit margin.Their profits come from other areas within the store and also the highvolume of.sales. A small independent pharmacy which is a mainstay inmany small South Dakota towns needs to make some profit on all itemssold in order to keep the doors open. It is my opinion that your research will discover a variety oftinconsistencies in the pricing structure related to pharmaceuticals.This is a multi-faceted problem and the better job you can do efdefining it, the better the solution will be. Again, thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion. '? ,_ Dear Senator Pressler, Thank you for your letter of August 17 regarding prescription drugprices,-fhe. copy of testimony to the Senate Aging committee which youenclosed indicates that you have an excellent understanding of theproblem. As an independent pharmacy owner, I was particularly pleasedby your expression of concern for the fate of small independent pharmaci-and tireir customers who are victimized by discriminatory drug pricing.-I urge you to continue to work for absolution to this problem.Discriminatory pharmaceutical pricing attacks the pocketbooks of afar greater number of people in this country than only those who patroni:small independent pharmacies. Indeed, the drug manufacturers treat smallindependent pharmacies such as my own and the nations largest pharmacychains virtually the same. Thus, regular cash paying customers pay thehighest price of anybody, whether they buy their prescriptions from anindependent or chain-owned pharmacy. It is important that any legislatiorthat may evolve to attempt to rectify this problem be presented as beingthe pro-consumer and pro-senior citizen legislation that it truly is,so that it is not doomed by being incorrectly perceived as some kind of\"bail-out, for the nations pharmacies. With regard to my experience in obtaining fair prices from suppliersI am treated the same as all other retail pharmacies by the nation'slarge drug manufacturers: I pay the highest of their several prices.The price is not negotiable.---.I must pay the price they have establishedin order to obtain the product to fill the prescriptions I am receiving.As you already know, that price is often outrageously higher than thatbeing charged to certain others. It seems to me that the Robinson-PatmanAct and Non-Profit Institutions Act need to be re-examined and revisionsto protect the American public from price-gouging considered. Please contact me at any time regarding issues or concerns involvingdrugs, pharmacy, or any other issue even if not pharmacy-related. 31-352 0 -90 -9254 _ el .* t# ~#L- t ---- .t ,256 August 20, 1989 i169 Lookout 14ne Rapid City, SDS_7701 Dear Senator Fressleri - In way of introduction, I would lie to introduce myself. I am a practicil\u00b6 pharmacist and 7irst-4ice iresident of the S.D. Pharmaceutical Association. I am writing to commend you for your efforts concerning the prob2lems writh prescription drug pricing. I know that Earilyn Schwans and C-aler, jordre have been in contact with you and I felt your testimony at the Ser.ate Aging Connittee hearing was accurate and to the point. The alarming part of all of this, was that I heard from a customer that residents of 3outh Dakota pay 3Z more for their prescriptions than any state in the nation. And perhaps if Lou read the lead-in paragraph of the Argus Leader concerning your probe (and did not finish the article!) you would agree that the article is mid-leading. I would hope that our customers will not begin to look elsewhere for their medications (mail-order houses in other states!) etc. Je at Boyd's Drug iNart in Rapid City are a highly competitive drug store. 'Ve compete with chain drug stores such as Shopko, Albertson's, and Safeway. For example, Shopko was selling Tagamet 300mg at $7.21 under costl We attempt to match them, but we lose $5.77 on each prescrIption for #100. Aibertson' Yc-uan thus see the idde disparity of prices in the prescription drug industry.W Perhaps the Association can spearhead an effort to pass a law similar to th9 liquor industry, that no product can be sold below its cost. This would eliminate -unfair competition and prevent pharmacy shopping, which has been proven to be detrimental to a patient's health. Thank you for your attention to the problem, and please continue your efforts Please let the association know if it can be of anv Assistance at any time.257 ,44editrol I Juc. AUTOMATED MEDICATION SYSTEMS Dear Senator, Your concern about the continued rise in the cost of medication to our senIor citlzens.-as-Vell as the rest of the sma1 T- -store-population,i is one shared by me as well. For 25 years I was involved in a clinic pharmacy in Rapid City. Since that time I have developed a-company here that makes an automated drug distribution system for hospitals. In my years in reLtal,pharaacy.,.I decided to do something about the high cost of drugs to our rural population by starting a company that combined a number of small retail drug stores into a buying group. We called it Nedcor. At that time, we bid drugs from major suppliers, We could buy 1000 capsules of an antibiotic, that normally cost individual stores $40.00, sell It to the store for $12.50 and still make 15 profit. Once this process was started the major manufacturers had a meetig here in Rapid City on ways to put us out of business. The stores were -offered free drugs if they would stop supporting our operation and var4Ious other measures which culminated in my suing 7 of the major drug companies. The suit was settled out of court. I only bring this up in that there Is a way to bring prices down, but it requires the small stores to join together to provide the buying power. That- Is the only thing that the drug companies understood. HowecXr we pharmazt9are much like the ranchers who will step in and help any. In trouble, but will never do anything togetheraor our mutual benefit. In thtszrespect, laws that would requIrellke bids, on like quantities, would ba.-b&1lpful. -Currently the law 4divides the buyers into groups (i.e., Lsmall retail stores, Tirger ietail stores, chains, small hospitals, large hospitals, etc.) This division gives the drug companies ways to circumvent the real purpose of the Robinson Patnam Act. To speak in the defense of the drug companies, I feel we must always * continue research and that to encourage this we must3asliov the patent protection that allows-a profit on the new drug.that is developed. It is imposiblezto stateihat a price is too high, but perhaps the length of -the patent-\u00b1is too long. Nov'to speak to the growing number of mail order operations: Hall orders are usually for long term medications, The calls in the mIddle of the night for a pain killer are never filled by these operations. Only the local pharmacist delivers this kind of necessary service and they are being put out of business. Hay I suggest the fol,loving: 1. Encourage pharmacists to band together to provide buying power. 2. Help them finance the project through SBA. 3. Eliminate the 'group' designations in Robinson- Patman and change them to 'quantity' purchased. It will be a long battle, but the purpose is certainly Just. Persevere! If I can be of any assistance, please give me a call.258 Dear Senator Pressler, I am responding to a letter that you sent regarding prescription prices As a pharmacist who has worked in -9Vptalsa= illatores and in mall-order pharmacy, I would like to present some of my views. It Is true that pharmacies with higher volumes of business are sometimes able to buy at better prices, however, the few percentages saved are hardly the reason why the prices they charge are lower. South Dakota has many rural pharmacies who do not have a lot of volume and therefore many times are forced to sell their prescriptions at much higher prices in order to do business. I feel that there are two primary reasons where a difference can be made: (1) If possible, I would like to see a government body appointed to approve how much a manufacturer Is allowed to charge for newly developed products. There should also be some regulation regarding how often and by how much they are to be allowed to raise prices on existing drugs. There is hardly a day that goes by when price increases do not occur. This Is the MANUFACTURER's fault, not the pharmacist or pharmacy who sells the medicine. We have no choice. Some prices are outrageous and I very such empathize with consumers, especially the elderly. (2) The other area where a difference could be made, but would probably be harder to do so, Is In the preferential pricing given to hospitals. This In many ways Increases the retail price in order to support the very Inexpensive prices that hospitals are given. It is definitely not fair, and again It all goes back to the manufacturer. It Is no wonder that stocks In major drug companies are good to be In-- they have no limit to what they can charge for their product, and the customer has no choice many times if there are no generics available. You no doubt have heard many negative things about mail- order pharmacy. I work at Tel-Drug, which Is the only mail-eyder pharmacy in South Dakota and only one of many in the counteW. We feelthat by keeping some mail-order pharmacy in the state help to enhance our state's economy Instead of losing the c business to out-of-state mail order services. I do the majority of ordering of prescription drugs for the operation and I can tell you that we do not buy at prices which are significantly lower than any other pharmacy in the state can get. I would be more than happy to show you our ordering system and operation In general. Many South Dakota pharmacists do not like our business because we take away their business and so you will hear negative things from them. I would probably be the same way if I were in their shoes. However, business Involves competition and that is the way our country runs-- and the ultimate winner is the consumer. The majority of our customers are elderly in South Dakota and they love us for two major reasons-- we save them money and deliver to their door via the mailbox. When you are old and are not able or willing to drive 30 miles to the nearest drug store, you really appreciate the savings of mail-order, as our cutomers do. Ask them. In closing, I would Invite you to call me at home (361-5405) or arrange a time which would be convenient and I would be more than happy to share more of my views or give you a tour of Tel- Drug. I would love to help you with your effort in these areas, because It is a very timely issue for all of us, but especially the elderly.259 RAPID CITY REGIONAL HOSPITAL Thank you for your recent letter concerning your activities at the Senate Aging. Committee hearing on prescription drug pricing and an invitation to comment. -- My perspective is that of a person who has a graduate degree and 15 years of experience in the hospital pharmacy arena. Drug prices are of critical importance to my department and the hospital. They are collectively the largest budgetary expense item in the department. Expenditures for drugs in today's 300+ bed hospital can amount to several million dollars an- nually. I have several brief comments: 1. The generic drug industry is very important to hospital pharmacy as a method of cost containment. It is important though that both the pub- lic and the medical profession be assured of quality of generic products. 2. The continued ability of hospitals to obtain \"non-profit\" or \"own use\" pricing is critical in holding the line on costs particularly since Medi- care/Medicaid reimbursement is many times inadequate. The difference in price between a competively bid multi-source drug product and the list price of the same product purchased at wholesale is several fold. In a department with a $1,000,000+ drug budget, a return to single-tier priFing could be catastrophic. This is no less of an issue for the small rural? hospital. 3. It appears to me that perhaps the most important single issue relating to recent drug price increases is the maintenance of the current drug patent laws which enable manufacturers to retain exclusivity for the -_ patent period. The health care industry is in a sense held hostage by this market domination of patented products. 4. The issue of substantial price breaks to non-profit entities by manu- facturers in order to build brand prestige, etc.. is a non-issue in my opinion. An interesting example is Tylenol. McNeil Consumer Product Division has for years given very significant price reductions to non- profit hospitals as a means of building brand recognition and prestige for Tylenol products. We at Rapid City Regional Hospital purchase and use the equivalent of 5 bottles of 100 tablets per week. If we were to assume that each drugstore (15 listed in Rapid City Yellow Pages) and grocery/convenience store (25 listed in Yellow Pages) were to sell an equal amount, we see that the closed-market segment of sales amounts to a mere 21 at most -a figure that one would hardly think would drive regular wholesale prices substantially higher. 5. The volume purchase discounts that chain pharmacies utilize are not unique to health care. Tell me that I pay the same price for a new Chevrolet as Avis does. Volume discounting is a part of a capital- istic society.260 / South Dakota Society of 7017 Universny Slatio, Broolings, SD 57007 (635) 688-6197 Dear Senator Pressler: I appreciate receiving a copy of your testimony at the Senate Ago~g Committee hearing. I am the Pharmacy Director of Mobridge Regiona'l Hospital in Mobridge and am the current President of the South Datkta Society of Hospital Pharmacists. From a personal and organizational perspective, I would like to present the community hospital side 6f the prescrspar~igdsai~ty. ._ The advent of DRG reimbursement several years ago has put a cap oni the ability of the rural hospital to generate revenue. At my, hospital - about 75% of patients are Medicare or Title-19 recipients and the hospital is paid a fixed fee for treating these patients. If that fee is not providing an acceptable margin of profit, or possibly not even covering costs in many instances, attempts to reduce costs must be made. For the pharmacy, one of the hospital's major revenue sources, the primary tool we can use is buying group Purchasing power and related bid pricing. Even the effectiveness of this tool has been dampened by inclusion of actual costs of drugs to hospitals in DRG formulas.- The Federal Government was not ignorant of pricing policies when putting together reimbursement figures! If all preferential and bid pricing was suddenly eliminated, our hospital along with most other. rural institutions would not survive. I do not favor exhorbitant pricing to the independant pharmacist, but extreme caution must be exercised in finding a solution to this problem. I feel Congress may be able to legislate better regulations and laws governing 'nonprofit\" status, but legislating across-the- board equivalent pricing (the goal of the Pharmacy Freedom Fund) would be devastating. I have many friends who own independent drug stores. and I know they are fighting some unfair battles. Chains and mail-e- order, along with HMO's, threaten their livelihoods. However, *they- have chosen their situations and must use the- tools they have at their disposal to fight the battle. The local hardware store and corner- grocery are fighting similar battles and use convenience and personal service to establish successful businesses. Please don't interpret my opinions as being anti-independant pharmacy. On the contrary. I feel the local drug store is absolutely essential to the public's health. If.means to provide more fair pricing can be found, I-am all for it. If this is'at the expense of the demise of rural hospitals, all will suffer. The Federal Government's costs of health care will skyrocket to unforseeable levels. Thank you for considering all sides and consequences of this issue before proceeding.261 ent' to' me oirAugust 17, 1989. I do not clajim' t6o have 'answers. However,, I will try to share my views and toin&On6 with you. 0n\u00a7 suestion you, mention involves the value of .he prescription D i 'eri e .AS Pcrip opf health ct6j*e Cosiderin--;thiis,.i,:believe that the cost:. o4preicript-.. ] B 'jUestiion~ yow is that of f- : SC3 son -4I~jwould- *airie~ssti~.the 'pharmacies, I am most concerned aboutithe-extra tVitn&-that will be invo:ved and also the computer expenEes\u008f'which- wilYB'be a part of.-the new Medicare system.. Pharmacies; in order to keep in operation'will need to be reimbursed-for this increased time spent-on required counseling and computer lag time,. and more importantly for the computer system whether on a':vblume basis or possibly on a per prescription basis. I am Worried that the new Medicare system might force most small independent retail pharmacies to close due to the enormous, number of elderly-persons involved and also due to inadequate ieimbursement. Increased numbers of third party.programs se, a D3Z-factor contributing factor for low'profits.- -hope\"to -oz.. a Business onee I 'can assure you tha 'thW average cost of each prescription would be lowered substantiallyI Awould estimate as much as twenty dollars less-per prescriptions Yo'u mention your findings that smaller pharmacies are charged -fiore than larger ones in more-populated areas.' I have not found the community size to be a factor; a single independent pharmacy in'fHudson; for instance, is charged the same as one in Sieur Falls. -The p~rice-discounts I-have seen are given to - pharmacies in which two or.more are owned by the same operation. The more stores owned,. the greater the discount given by the , wholeiaaler. The savings; .however, to these pharmacies is rarely vassed'on to the customer.262 2 r problem, even with the tighter regulations, is abuse of-physician samples. I think that if fewer samples were available, perhaps the manufacturers could reduce the price. charged to the wholesaler. Persons with the greatest need are generally not the ones receiving the samples anyway. To learn why prescriptioh drugs are so expensive, one must not overlook the drug manufacturers. Drug development is a very expensive, time consuming process which cannot promise success. Thousands of chemicals are tested in search of one that is promising. Generally, it takes greater than $90 million and between seven to ten years before the FDA approves a drug. Currently, an investigational new drug must show that it is safe and effective in both test tubes and animals before going through three clinical trial phases in humans. Only about- twenty percent of all new drugs tested pass the three phases and finally are approved by the FDA. Pharmaceutical manufacturers spend an average of 15 percent of their profits on drug research. Perhaps they could better explain to you why the prescription drugs are so expensive. Another area of concern is if Medicare requires generic use as is the case with Medicaid. Federal-law requires that I dispense a brand name product when a physician signs on the. \"dispense as written\" side rather than the \"substitution permitted\" side on the prescription blank. However, Medicaid will only-pay the generic price unless the doctor-writes in his/her ovaijvriting, \"brand medically necessary,\" something I have neverB5Xnce seen. This cohtradicts the legal requirement. 'If I dispense a generic ,for a'd'is-ense as .written\"!

YOU DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF DEFENDING THE INTERESTS OF INDEPENDENT PHARMACISTS IN SOUTH DAKOTA: I CANNOT GIVE YOU ANY NEW INFORMATION, HOWEVER, I CAN SAY THAT INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES ARE HAVING FINCANIAL PROBLEMS IN SOUTH DAKOTA, AND VERY FEW ARE SALABLE OPERATIONS TODAY. MY WIFE AND I OPERATED 5CHWANS DRUG IN HOVEN FOR 13 YEARS AND ARE JUST COMPLETING OUR 6TH YEAR IN BELLE FOURCHE. IN 1983 WE SOLD A VERY PROFIT- ABLE STORE IN HOVEN TO JUDY BROWN. JUST LAST MONTH JUDY BROWN WAS FORCED TO'CLOSE THE PHARMACY IN HOVEN. (THE STORE IS STILL OPEN PS P SUNDRY STOREI. THIS REALLY BOTHERS ME BECAUSE FOR 13 YEARS THAT STORE PROVIDED OUR FAMILY WITH A COMFORTABLE LIVING. JUDY IS AN EXCELLENT BUSINESS PER- SON BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THE MAIL ORDER FIRMS. HER DOCTORS DO NOT ALLOW GENERIC SUBSTITUTION. JUDY HADCTI'.'USE EXPENSIVE BRAND NAME DRUGE AND THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS THAT SHE CDUIfl.NOT GET AN ADEQUATE FEE TO STAY IN BUSINESS IN HOVEN. SIX YEARS AGO WHEN MARILYN AND I PURCHASED CLIFF THOMAS DRUG IN BELLE FOURCHE FROM RETIRING CLIFF THOMAS THE GOAL WAS THAT I WOULD RUN THE STORE AND MARILYN WOULD BE AT HOME WITH THE FAMILY AND JUST RELIEVE ME FOR NOON HOURS, HAIR CUTS, ETC.

Senator Pressler, thank you. Senator Bradley. STATEMENT OF SENATOR BILL BRADLEY Senator BRADLEY. Mr. Chairman, I don't have an opening state- ment. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for being here, Senator Bradley. If you have any questions, we are going to have a short questioning period in a moment. I already mentioned the price escalation of the drug that Mr. Green is taking. I would like, if I might, also tell Mrs. Bivens that in 1964 Elde- pryl was discovered in Hungary and has since been marketed there. Today, a U.S. pharmaceutical firm merely purchases Elde- pryl from the Hungarian company and sells it in the United States. In Italy, one pill of Eldepryl'is 41 cents, per pill. In Canada, it is $1 per pill. In the United States, it is $2.38 per pill. We are shortly going to have some explanations as to why the drug prices in our country are so much higher than they are in almost any other area of the world. Let me if I might just ask a couple of questions, and then I will yield to Senator Heinz. Tell me, if you will, Mr. Hodel, about the so-called \"give-away\" program of aerosol Pentamidine to indigent victims of AIDS. Is this program working? Mr. HODEL. Lyphomed has been talking to the community about creating an indigent patient program for some months, beginning at the point when the drug was approved for aerosol use in June. Since that time, they have not formalized the details of the pro- gram in any significant manner as far as I am aware. They are close to doing so, they say, but we are not yet aware of any distri- bution of the drug. They have indicated that they intend to give drugs away to com- munity-based, not-for-profit clinics, and allow those clinics to decide who is indigent and therefore who is entitled to the drug. We are aware of community-based clinics all over the country who have written to Lyphomed requesting such assistance, but are not yet aware of any receiving such assistance. I admit that we are somewhat dubious about Lyphomed's inten- tions. The announcement of the indigent patient program followed considerable media attention to the importation of a competitive product from England. So we viewed it largely as a media ploy. The CHAIRMAN. How many of the AIDS victims that you know of are ordering their pentamidine from Europe? Mr. HODEL. It is difficult to estimate, although I would guess that it is no more than a few hundred. It is a very difficult process to import a medication from any other country, so most people just aren't aware of it. The CHAIRMAN. I don't think there is any dispute as to the exact sameness or similarity between the pentamidine produced in Eng- land and the American equivalent, manufactured by Lyphomed. Lyphomed, as I understand, protested to the Food and Drug Ad- ministration, and asked the Food and Drug Administration to have267 Customs officers stop and seize all of this English-made drug coming in to our borders. Mr. HODEL. To the best of my knowledge, it is. THE CHAIRMAN. We have cables to that effect, and I am going to place those cables in the record,4because I think it shows the extent a drug manufacturer will go to to basically protect their turf and their monopoly, as given to them by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration, or under the laws of this country. The CHAIRMAN. We appreciate what you have had to say. I am going to yield. We have a large number of Senators here. I wonderif we could invoke the 5-minute rule, and we will yield to Senator Heinz for 5 minutes of questions. Senator HEINZ. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I am going to ask unanimous consent to submit Senator Wilson's statement for the record, if you please. The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Wilson follows:] SgentJ /S>4rCt NOVEMBER 16, 1989 , / SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING LEM I,- 6- W C0-t PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING -S -- . ac MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM PLEASED THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING HAS THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO EXPLORE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS RELATING TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE'S JULY HEARING WAS EFFECTIVE IN OUTLINING THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF ESCALATING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. TODAY WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO EXAMINE PRIVATE SECTOR EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND TO CONSIDER THE APPLICATION OF SUCH STRATEGIES TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AS WE LEARNED IN JULY'S HEARING, THE STEADY AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS. AT THE TIME OF THE HEARING THE ISSUE HAD PARTICULAR REVELANCE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WE PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM FOR ELDERLY AMERICANS UNDER THE MEDICARE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE ACT. WHILE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THE CATASTROPHIC ACT REMAINS UNCERTAIN, IT IS CLEAR THE DRUG BENEFIT WILL BE ELIMINATED. HOWEVER, THE CONTINUED ESCALATION IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES REMAINS COMPELLING AND RELEVANT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS MEDICAID SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IN MY STATE, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS REPRESENT THE FOURTH LARGEST CATEGORY OF SPENDING IN THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM, AS WE CALL MEDICAID IN CALIFORNIA. STRIKINGLY, PRESCRIPTION DRUG EXPENDITURES HAVE DRAMATICALLY OUTPACED OTHER SERVICES OF THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM, JUMPING 150 PERCENT SINCE FISCAL YEAR 1978-79 WHILE ALL OTHER MEDI-CAL SERVICES ROSE 50 PERCENT.269 MR. CHAIRMANAYOU REFERREDATO LEGISLATION OFFERED IN CALIFORNIA, A.B. 2148, BY ASSEMBLYMAN BAKER THAT AUTHORIZED THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES TO NEGOTIATE REBATES FROM MANUFACTURERS OF SINGLE SOURCE DRUGS. I WOULD REQUEST, MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT THE LETTER PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE BY ASSEMBLYMEN BAKER AND ISENBERG REGARDING THIS MEASURE BE MADE PART OF THE RECORD. THE ASSEMBLYMEN'S LETTER NOTES THAT THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM PAYS OVER $130 MILLION EACH YEAR FOR SINGLE SOURCE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, FOR WHICH THE STATE PAYS WHOLESALE OR \"LIST\" PRICE. IN PAYING LIST PRICE FOR THESE DRUGS, MEDI-CAL RECEIVES NO DISCOUNTS, SPENDING BETWEEN 20 AND 80 PERCENT MORE THAN OTHER MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. SIGNIFICANTLY, MR. CHAIRMAN, AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS, BY AUTHORIZING THE NEGOTIATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES, ASSEMBLYMAN BAKER'S LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN SAVINGS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE AREA OF $40 MILLION. WHILE IT IS DISCOURAGING THAT THIS MEASURE WAS ABLE TO MUSTER ONLY FOUR COMMITTEE VOTES IN THE FACE OF INTENSIVE LOBBYING ON THE PART OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, I AM ENCOURAGED BY EFFORTS BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES TO ENTER INTO DISCOUNT CONTRACTS WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS. IN LIGHT OF INCREASINGLY CONSTRAINED MEDICAID BUDGETS AND ESCALATING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, I AM CONVINCED THIS IS THE DIRECTION ALL STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS MUST TARE. AS AN ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN TUESDAY'S NEW YORK TIMES BUSINESS SECTION SUGGESTS, THE TOLERANCE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PRESCRIPTION DRUG BUYERS OF RISING DRUG COSTS IS WANING. THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE IS NEGOTIATED DRUG PRICES BETWEEN STATE AND PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS AND DRUG MANUFACTURERS. I WOULD ASK, MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT THIS ARTICLE ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE RECORD.270 MR. CHAIRMAN, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND TO EXPORE SOME OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO GET A BETTER DEAL FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAS MUCH TO LEARN FROM THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS (HMOs), HOSPITALS AND BUYING GROUPS TO IMPROVE THEIR NEGOTIATING POSTURE AND TO WORK WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO REDUCE PRICES. WHILE I REGRET THAT I WILL.BE UNABLE TO STAY FOR THE DURATION OF THE HEARING, DUE TO OTHER COMMITTEE COMMITTMENTS, I LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE HEARING RECORD. THANK YOU, MR.

I would like to ask Mr. Green a question. Taking a slightly different angle than just the cost angle of the drugs, Mr. Green, your story is a struggle against the odds to remain inde- pendent and you are very nervous about what is going to happen to you in the future. I would like to know whether you have any insurance, other than Medicare, to help you defray the cost of your prescription drugs. Mr. GREEN. If I may refer to one thing, also, concerning your question, you were talking about the prices of Mestinon. I get mine through the Myasthenia Gravis Association, which is one of the best organizations in the country. Without them, I would be really suffering if I could not get my drug through their pill bank. They have really helped me. As you asked about the insurance, they said I could get it free, but they said I would have to sign a paper that I am in very deep poverty and cannot afford to buy the pill, and also that I don't have any insurance. I do carry Blue Cross, which pays for $500 of medicine a year. But the first $100, $400 to $500, you pay yourself. But the premium I pay is $70.80 per month. You can get a premium without the cov- erage for medicine for $40. So in other words, you are paying around $28 or $29 a month for your own medicine. When you get through at the end of the year, with the price of $87 a month for your medicine-I didn't figure it out exactly-they are paying around $125 or $130 for your medicine, you are paying for it yourself. So you are not actually benefiting. Senator HEINZ. So the insurance concept of protections in this case does not work. You are not getting any benefits. Mr. GREEN. It does not. If the medicine keeps on going up, you're -q,-a.deeper. hole -than you were before. -Senator HEINZ. Mr. Chairman, that's my point. Most of the elder- ly have Medigap policies, as I understand it, or private insurance of one kind. or another, that purport to provide some kind of insur- ance on prescription drugs. A lot of them, and Mr. Green's is one example, simply do not. It seems to me that if we are going to have meaningful Medigap in- surance, it ought to make the hole in coverage smaller, not keep it as large, or in some cases, make it larger. That is Medicavern, not Medigap. I know that is not a specific subject of this hearing, but it is a subject we should look at, maybe on another occasion, or at least in the Finance Committee, where a number of us serve. Mr. Green, I thank you very much. I do have other.questions, but don't want to go beyond my time. I do want to ask Mr. Hodel one question. Mr. Hodel, you dis- cussed the fact that social workers sometimes encourage people to quit their jobs in order to qualify for Medicaid. Mr. HODEL. That is certainly correct. Senator HEINZ. Do you know whether that is also true for people who are HIV positive and/or persons who have AIDS? Mr. HODEL. Generally, with people who are simply HIV positive, many of those people are not yet ill. While they begin to incur medical expenses, they do not become extraordinarily high until they do become ill.275 It is generally assumed among social workers that once onebegins to develop serious symptoms, that it is a matter of declineafter that. It is generally assumed that one will quit one's job atsome point. Many people with AIDS, because they are in their thirties or for-ties, are without savings that will carry them for very long, and soit is assumed that they will eventually end up on Medicaid.Senator HEINZ. To the extent that they are advised to quit theirjobs and go on Medicaid, is that in substantial part because of thecost of drugs like pentamidine? Mr. HODEL. Certainly. For people without insurance, medicationcosts for AIDS can amount to thousands and thousands of dollarsper year. I personally know several people who pay well over$1,000 per month for medications, and I should point out that thatincludes people who do not take AZT, which is perhaps the mostexpensive. Senator HEINZ. But one of the reasons they do go on Medicaidand quit their jobs to go on Medicaid is because of the cost ofdrugs? Mr. HODEL. Absolutely. Because Medicaid will cover the costs ofthose drugs. Senator HEINZ. Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I must observethat a policy that encourages people to stop work so they can con-tinue to function is an upside down policy.Mr. HODEL. It would seem so.Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Senator Heinz.Senator Reid. Senator REID. I have no questions at this time.The CHAIRMAN. All right. I believe Senator Cohen was next andthen Senator Bradley. Senator COHEN. Mr. Green, you mentioned the MyastheniaGravis Association of Western Pennsylvania. Do they provide dif-ferent types of medications at a lower cost to you and others whoare afflicted with this disease. Mr. GREEN. The medication they provide for me is Mestinon. It isprovided at quite a bit lower cost than what I can buy it for at thedrug store. Senator COHEN. According to your statement, once Hoffman-LaRoche transferred the distribution rights to ICN Pharmaceuti-cals, they no longer sold at either a wholesale or reduced rate tothe Association of Pennsylvania. Is that correct?Mr. GREEN. According to statement, when I was notified fromthe pill bank in Western Pennsylvania that the distribution rightshad been sold to ICN, I called up the branch in Chicago. They toldme it was going up to $87 because they had refused to honor thecontract in Western Pennsylvania and elsewhere that was for $40.In other words, the contract had expired as of June 1, or whateverit was, and that was it. After that contract expired, ICN refused toextend the contract at that price.I think the representatives of the Myasthenia Gravis Associationcould give you a better idea as to who did what, but the price didgo up to $87. But the Myasthenia Gravis Association in Chicago gotthat for me. I get the pills out of what they call the American DrugRX, out of Salt Lake City, UT. The medicine is sold to them, and worked through the pill bank at that price. Otherwise, today, in our town it is $136 per 500 pills. I heard last night that in New York City and some places, it was $150 to $160 for 500 pills, and that the price is going up again. So where it stops, nobody knows. Senator COHEN. The association that you are getting the pills from now charges you how much, $87 and it is going up to $93? Mr. GREEN. It has gone up 8 percent, yes, just the other day when I was preparing this speech, on November 1. Senator COHEN. And that's still at a discount rate? Mr. GREEN. That is a discount rate, but the Myasthenia Gravis Association, according to what I understand, they are absorbing a lot of the cost. -Senator COHEN. In other words, if you did not have access to this association, the cost to you would be much higher even than $93? v Mr. GREEN. Oh, yes. I was very fortunate in one respect. I heard of this -organization through Muscular Dystrophy, they told me about this organization in Pennsylvania. When I wrote to them and explained my situation, they told me it would cost $10 to join the organization, a final membership fee. Since then I have been very fortunate that I can get the pills from them. The way the cost goes up and up, we never know what it is going to be. Senator COHEN. How many people have this disease that do not have access to the organization? Mr. GREEN. There is an estimated 125,000 to 150,000. I might be a little lower or higher. The thing is, if I may point out, I stated in my speech that it is a rare disease at that point. A lot of people have Myasthenia Gravis but they don'1 know it. It took around 3 or 4 weeks of testing to finally figure out that I have it. After all kinds of blood tests, they finally determined that's what it was. Today, a lot of people have it but they still don't know what it is. The think it's just a muscle deficiency, or-arthritis, or something like. Senator COHEN. And if they do find -out what they have, they cannot afford to take care of it? Mr. GREEN. When it gets to that point, they estimate it will get higher and higher, your medication remains the same, there is no generic drug, either you pay for it or take the consequences. You have to take it to live. It controls the disease, but there is no cure for it. Senator COHEN. Thank you. The CHAIRMAN. Mr; Hodel, the charts that you brought before the committee today in your statement indicate that since 1984, there has been a 400-percent increase in the price of this particular drug that is life-sustaining to many members of the AIDS commu- nity. Have you, or anyone else who might be a spokesman for the com- munity gone to this particular company, Lyphomed and attempted to find out, one, why this price is justified, or two, if they are going to deem that they do or do not have a social responsibility in this field? Has there been any contact with the company? Mr. HODEL. There have been numerous attempts by AIDS advo- cates and by the media to learn from Lyphomed the justification277 for the price increase. Most of those attempts have been unsuccess-ful. There has also been a concerted effort among 20 of the largestAIDS organizations in the country to contact Lyphomed to requesta meeting concerning pentamidine pricing. As of 2 days ago, Ly-phomed has indicated that they would meet.The CHAIRMAN. That they would meet?Mr. HODEL. Yes. That was news I received just Monday of thisweek. That meeting has not yet taken place.The CHAIRMAN. I will say this, and I probably shouldn't, butsome of the companies, the manufacturers, have expressed an in-terest in meeting with some of the members of this committee. Iknow my friend Senator Warner and Senator Heinz and othershave thought it might be constructive to sit down with the manu-facturers and talk about this. Maybe that would be constructive.I have reservations about this because I think that these drugpricing mechanisms should be in the public, not the private,domain. I truly feel that as the Government is probably the No. 1purchaser of many of the drugs we. are talking about we shouldhave public access to the reasons for these price increases.The drug manufacturers may not know it, but they are diggingthemselves into a very deep hole. The Congress is not going tostand around and watch drug prices in the community that yourepresent go up 400 percent, 238 percent for Mr. Green's drugs.We're not going to stand here and watch people in Italy pay 41cents for Mrs. Bivens' pill and $1 in Canada and $2.38 here.This system is not going to permit that. What we do with thisproblem is another question, but there is no doubt that somethingis going to be done. This system is going to respond.Senator Warner. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN WARNER Senator WARNER. Mr. Chairman, I would say that we ought to atleast give the companies an opportunity. They have responded witha willingness to come forward and talk to members of this commit-tee. They do operate in a free-enterprise system. It is the systemwhich has produced these magnificent drugs. They have proprie-tary interests, and I, like you, want to get at the bottom of thisissue. Indeed, all across America we should get at the bottom ofthis issue. Nevertheless, we should do it in fairness and within the frame-work of the free-enterprise system which we have in this Nation.The CHAIRMAN. I feel like, Senator Warner, if these manufactur-ers were sitting there in your office or mine, and we closed thedoor, and they told me some deep, dark secrets that inadvertentlyin a hearing like this, I might just blurt them out. I don't want todo that. Senator WARNER. We had better be prepared to take those risksif we are going to get at the bottom of these issues. These are im-portant issues, and let's get on with it.The CHAIRMAN. Senator Warner, do you have any questions forthese witnesses? Senator WARNER. Not of this panel. I will wait for the nextpanel.278 The CHAIRMAN. Senator Cohen or Senator Heinz. Senator HEINZ. No further questions. The GHAIRMAN.-I have one question for Mr. Green. You had an opportunity there a year or so ago, or months ago, when the prices of these drugs started going up dramatically, to sign a statement that you did not have the ability to pay for these drugs any longer. You would basically have become a Medicaid recipient. You could have signed a letter of impoverishment. I think you had that op- portunity. You refused to do so. Is that correct? Mr. GREEN. Yes, sir: I'm not in poverty, and I don't ask for char- ity. The thing that really bothers me and gets me, is that one com- pany can control the-price of one pill, Mestinon, which has been in existence for a -long time. The product is the same, but they keep raising the price. If you have to have that to control the disease, it's the most effec- tive drug I -can take, it controls what I have, which is called ocular- neuromuscular disease. It started in my. eyes. I am very fortunate in one respect. A lot of people have it in their chest, in their speech, and some people really have it bad. So far, the drug has helped to control mine, and I need it. I cannot say \"I need another pill.\" My doctor himself said, \"Take the pills, I don't want to take you off them because I don't know what the side effects will be.\" So as long as I'm doing well with it, I am taking it. But why should a- company take advantage of me? Not only me, but I am speaking for other people that take Mestinon. The-CHAIRMAN. If we become angry-let's say that Coca-Cola has raised their prices too much, then we have an option. We can drink Pepsi-Cola. You don't have an option like that here. We are dealing with a pretty monopolistic environment, where there are -no op- tions for the consumerne.and xvery -few options, for the Government. But we are going to talk -about some of the options for the Govern- ment in our next panel. Does anybody have- any follow-on questions or statements? Senator Heinz. Senator HEINZ. Just a comment on the discussion you and Sena- tor Warner were having a moment ago on the drug companies. I think we need to find a-way to talk with the drug companies. But we need to understand that there are sensitive proprietary issues involved. I am hopeful-that through meetings, we can understand these proprietary concerns, and decide-to what extent they are le- gitimate concerns. The present situation is kind of a standoff, with concerned mem- bers unable to talk to them and they, unwilling to talk to us. That's clearly unacceptable to all involved. Nonetheless, because it is unacceptable is not to say that they. may not have some legiti- mate concerns. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, that we can find a way to have a dialog. I support you in that goal. Senator WARNER. One thing, Senator Heinz. I think you said they are unwilling to come forward. It's my understanding that they are willing, providing that we can give adequate protection to the laws of this land which provide for proprietary interests. Senator HEINZ. I think it is a semantic issue.279 Senator WARNER. I know, but I don't want people to leave think-ing they are unwilling. Senator HEINZ. The unwillingness is that they don't want tocome up here without our having a clear understanding of whattheir proprietary concerns are. I was not using the term in a pejo-rative sense, I was using it, I thought, descriptively. I think prob-ably now that we understand the semantics, we agree.Senator WARNER. We do. Because I have made an effort to getout and talk with them, and gain this information. I have hadthem, individually and collectively, express to me a willingness tocome in and talk providing we accord them certain rights. If weare to get to the bottom of this issue, we have got to figure out howto solve that problem of receiving that evidence.The CHAIRMAN. I thank my colleagues very much. We are goingto dismiss this panel and call our next panel. We thank all of youvery, very much. This has been very constructive testimony. Thankyou. Ladies and gentlemen, our last panel related to the victims ofhigh prescription drug prices. The second panel will describe whatthe private sector and the State of Virginia are doing-or trying todo-to get a better and fairer deal on the price of prescriptiondrugs. We have three, witnesses. In just a moment I am going to allowSenator Warner to introduce his constituent from South Hill, VA,Mr. Mike Berryman, who is chairman of the board of Medical As-sistance Services. We also have Mr. Tery Baskin, the director andchairman of PACE Alliance, in Little Rock, AR, and Dr. NorrieWilkins, vice president of pharmaceutical management, accompa-nied by Dr. Donna Schmidt, manager for clinical pharmacy pro-grams, Partners National Health Plans, of Minneapolis, MN.We are very grateful for the presence of the three of you. Let meyield at this time to my good friend, Senator Warner from Virgin-ia. Senator WARNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We welcome thepanel, particularly the distinguished Virginian, Mike Berryman.Mike if I may say, you represent the all-American pharmacist. Youare out there fighting. You are out there trying to achieve the re-sults that this committee is striving to achieve.The difference is that you have had some success, and you havenegotiated on behalf of your group in Virginia with the pharma-ceutical associations, and you have been able to produce results forthose who come into your store every day, to get your advice andyour assistance, your compassion and understanding.Good luck. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Mr. Berryman, as a personal note,about once a year, and only once a year, your distinguished Sena-tor and friend, Senator Warner, takes off a little time from his Sen-atorial responsibilities to play golf. About 3 weekends ago, I sharedthe rare opportunity of playing golf with Senator Warner. I mighttell you that his drive on the first tee, we measured it, was 283yards. I won't tell you in which direction it was.Senator WARNER. I tell you, I took an aspirin that night after Iwas finished.280 The CHAIRMAN. We will hear from Mr. Berryman first, I think, and once again, the basic thrust of this panel is how we might get drug manufacturers to the bargaining table, what is happening out in the private sector and the States and how we can negotiate a fairer deal for-the American consumer and taxpayer. Mr. Berryman. STATEMENT OF R. MICHAEL BERRYMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES, SOUTH HILL, VA Mr. BERRYMAN. Thank you, Senator Pryor, and-members of the committee. The CHAIRMAN. Can I ask you this? Can each of you perhaps hold your statement to 5 minutes each? Then we will have ques- tions, because I think.other Senators are coming. I think there also will be a vote on the Senate floor before too long, and I hate to have you just sitting here. So if we could proceed under the 5- minute rule, we will put the full body of your statements into the record. Mr. BERRYMAN. I am Mike Berryman, and I have been a practic- ing pharmacist for 25 years in Kenbridge, VA, and South Hill. I am also the current chairman of the board of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees Virginia's Medicaid program. From 1984 to 1985 I was president of the State pharmaceutical association. I also sit on the Virginia Joint Subcommittee on Health Care for All Virginians,. which is wrestling with- the growing problem of provid- ing affordable health care to- 880,000 citizens in Virginia that have no insurance. I appreciate the opportunity to share my views with you today on discriminatory pricing in the prescription drug industry, and the ever-increasing costs in that industry. The Commonwealth is very concerned with-theincreasing costs of prescription drugs, par- ticularly -in its Medicaid -program. Something is seriously wrong when an incredible disparity in the cost of drugs is realized. For example, the Medical College of Virginia, which is located -within six -blocks of the-lediraid office, and the Medical College is a State agency,- of icourse; purchases transdermal nitroglycerin patches for a penny for a box of 100 patches, fwhile the Department of Medical Assistance Services, a sister State agency, must pay in excess of $1 per patch for the same product. Unfortunately, this example is completely indicative of the dis- criminatory pricing strategies that drug manufacturers pursue in their quest for unconscionable profits. Another example of which I am personally aware involved an el- derly lady who lived in my community on a fixed income of $168 a month. She requires several medications per month, which she pur- chases at our pharmacy-at a cost of $120. Yet, if she could purchase those same -drugs at discriminatory preferential prices, she would spend only about $30 per month. I submit to you that something is wrong. I have been asked specifically within the context of Virginia's Medicaid -program, why Virginia is searching for ways to reduce the costs of prescription drugs, given- the fact that drugs are a rela- tively modest percentage of Virginia's Medicaid budget. They do281 represent only 7 to 8 percent of the budget, nevertheless, it is a $67million cost. In Virginia, we have had some very traumatic issues that wehave had to confront in the past year. One had to do with thetransplant issue. We had to vote to deny transplant coverage forliver and bone marrow transplants because of a lack of funding inthe State. So if we can save money on the drug program, and reduce someof the money that we are spending in that effort, we will be able toexpand our services to other recipients.To that end, Virginia has imposed restrictions on the use of newdrug products that are not necessarily of any new therapeuticvalue. Virginia has eliminated coverage for nitroglycerin patchesbecause their cost cannot be justified when cheaper and equally ef-ficacious drugs are available. In addition to these steps, Virginia's General Assembly has es-tablished a legislative study commission to study the issue of Med-icaid reimbursement of drugs. That committee is seriously consid-ering two options. One; a rebate program, and two, a restricteddrug formulary. If enacted, these initiatives should put the drug manufacturerson notice that Government cannot continue to tolerate the rapidand unreasonable escalation of drug costs. If these do not work,then perhaps, as you have suggested, Senator Pryor, it is time forthe Congress to take steps to control the unreasonable pricing poli-cies of prescription drug manufacturers. I want to add that we in Virginia, and I know your committee aswell, want a viable, healthy drug industry in this Nation. Theyhave made significant contributions to society, and we need that.We also need the industry to come to the table.All providers in the Medicaid program, hospitals, physicians,pharmacists, everybody, has shared the cost burden and many pro-vide services at cost or below, or just a smidgen above. Today, ourproblem in Virginia is that we have been unable to get the manu-facturers to share any of that burden. They will talk to us, but wedon't seem to get any substantive results.It appears that the Congress and Medicaid agencies need a jointeffort to try to bring these costs in line, at least for agencies likeMedicaid and Medicare. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today, and I would bevery happy to answer any questions you have.[The prepared statement of Mr. Berryman follows:]! 282 ADDITIONAL STATEMENT OF MR. R. MICHAEL BERRYMAN to the Senate special Committee on Aging Concerning Prescription Drug Manufacturer Pricing Policies and Practices November 16, 1989 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am Michael Berryman, a practicing pharmacist in the commonwealth of Virginia. I am also the Chairman of the Virginia Board of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, Virginia's Medicaid agency. I am a past president of the Virginia Pharmaceutical Association, and I also sit as a member of the Joint Subcommittee on Health Care for All Virginians, which is dealing with how to finance health care for the indigent and the uninsured. Virginia elected to participate in Medicaid in 1969. Since that time, the Medicaid budget of the Commonwealth of Virginia has grown from fifty-five million dollars per biennium to almost two billion dollars per biennium today. Remarkably, a substantial portion of this growth in the Medicaid budget has occurred'between 1985 and 1989. In that time frame, the Medicaid budget expanded by 103%. I am sure that it comes as no surprise to any of you that Virginia, like every other state, is facing a fiscal crisis insofar as controlling increasing health care costs, financing those increased costs, and insuring the delivery of needed medical care services to the entire population, but particularvlynto those individuals who are indigent. Cost containment in Virginia's Medicaid program has been an ongoing concern since at least 1975 when the Commonwealth first felt the need to constrain a budget that appeared to grow without any control whatsoever. The 1975 cost containment efforts were directed primarily at the hospital industry. Between 1975 and 1982, there were other minor cost containment efforts but they were principally technical in nature. It was not until 1982 when the Commonwealth, again, pursued significant cost containment efforts. At that time, the Administration was so concerned about the Medicaid budget that it gave'serious consideration to eliminating coverage for the medically needy in Virginia which, as you know, is an optional coverage group for Medicaid./ 283 Since 1982, every session of the General Assembly has wrestled with the problem of containing cost in Medicaid. As a result, Virginia has examined and re-examined and examined again every conceivable aspect of the Virginia Medicaid program to identify areas in which cost savings can be effected. Pharmacy costs are no exception. virginia was one of the first states to develop an effective means for providing and reimbursing prescription drug costs in a Medicaid program. Virginia elected to provide prescription drugs as part of its program, even though it was an optional service, because of its belief that the availability of drugs would prevent more serious illnesses, requiring expensive hospitalizations. Simply put, prescription drugs can and do contain Medicaid costs because they are essential to preventive medicine. Accordingly, Virginia is a strong supporter of an effective pharmacy program in state Medicaid programs. Prescription drugs are \"cost-necessary.\" Nonetheless, Virginia's program could not ignore the fact that the pharmacy budget increased 71% from 1984 to 1988. That increase was attributable to the increased costs of the drug products themselves, principally sole source drugs where prescription drug manufacturers enjoy carte blanche in setting prices. Accordingly, in 1988, the General Assembly directed the program to reduce pharmacy expenditures by $5.5 million and gave the Department the responsibility of identifying the means for achieving such a reduction. After several months of working with the Virginia Pharmaceutical Association, the Virginia Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the 1989 session of the General Assembly put in place four cost containment measures for pharmacy. Those cost containment measures were as follows: (1) one professional dispensing fee per drug per month; (2) an increased recipient co- pay; (3) discontinuance of coverage of transdermal delivery systems; and (4) limitation on coverage of new drug products. In addition, the General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution No. 403, which authorized a legislative subcommittee to study the issue of rising pharmacy costs in particular. Accordingly, the General Assembly recognized that pharmacy costs were sufficiently unique and important to require its own, separate study.284 The HJR No. 403 subcommittee has been meeting throughout the past several months, acquiring information and trying to identify appropriate solutions for cost containment in the Medicaid pharmacy budget. Although Medicaid pharmacy costs are only 7-8% of the total Virginia Medicaid budget, the Commonwealth is concerned that that part of its budget is growing without reason; normal inflationary factors are not the source of the pharmacy increases. The Commonwealth will undoubtedly consider a number of options for trying to reduce drug costs. First, the Commonwealth is looking seriously at the adoption of a restricted drug formulary for use in the Medicaid program. The Virginia Pharmaceutical Association and the Virginia Association of Chain Drug Stores actively support this alternative. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, on the other hand, opposes the adoption of such a formulary and, indeed, that organization has even advocated the elimination of the restriction on newadrug products, which the 1989 General Assembly mandated. ~Secondlyr the Commonwealth has discussed the option of some f\u00a3em of rebate program or a most-favored nations program whereby each drug manufacturer, depending on the volume of its drugs dispensed to Medicaid recipients, would rebate a particular amount of money to the Department of Medical Assistance Services. When this possibility-was specifically discussed with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association by Virginia's Medicaid Director, he was quickly reminded by PMA that he had no legal authority and that that was not an option PMA would support. The underlying theory for such a rebate program is the fact that other agencies of the Commonwealth which directly purchase pharmaceutical products, such as the Medical College of Virginia and-the various health agencies in Virginia, are able to obtain those drug products at costs that are significantly below the cost that retail drug stores are able to acquire them. For example, it has been reported that the Medical College of Virginia is able to buy a box of transdermal nitroglycerin patches at a price of a-penny for 100 patches,twhereas, the Department of Medical Assistance Services must pay in excess of $1.00 per patch. It makes little sense for a welfare program to pay premium prices for drug products when sister agencies may purchase those same products at a greatly reduced cost.285 Thirdly, the Commonwealth will also pursue a reinvigorated and more thorough drug utilization review program to ensure that physicians and Medicaid recipients are using drugs under appropriate conditions of medical necessity, as well as ensuring efficiencies and economy. Obviously, the real difficulty in attempting, within the context of a Medicaid program, to control the rising costs of drugs is the fact that the Commonwealth does not have a Medicaid provider contract with any drug manufacturer. Instead, the Commonwealth has a contract only with the retail pharmacy. Accordingly, to effect a rebate program or a most-favored nation clause raises some serious legal questions as to the authority of the state to enact cost containment measures that directly affect the drug manufacturers. Accordingly, to the extent that this Committee may be considering amendments to federal law, I certainly hope that it will give very serious consideration to mechanisms that will allow either the Federal Government or individual state governments to impose appropriate cost containment measures upon drug manufacturers. The Congress must appreciate that for the past 30 years it has effectively set health care policy. Therefore, Congress should act to establish a clear legal basis for cost containment measures in which drug manufacturers participate. Your staff also asked me to address briefly whether the states ought to be allowed to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with some kind of rebate program such as I have discussed. obviously, I believe that is a viable alternative, and one which would be made more legally defensible if the Congress took appropriate legislative action. Nevertheless, I point out to the Committee that, if such authority is not provided the states, then the only other realistic possibility for addressing this problcm is to impose a system upon the drug manufacturers which restricts them in setting their own pricing policies. Obviously, this is an extreme alternative, but, if drug manufacturers are not going to be reasonable in their charges, then government must act. I appreciate the opportunity to address the Committee today Mr. Chairman, and would be more than happy to answer any questions the Committee may have concerning the situation in Virginia. In the event that I do not have specific facts and figures that may be of interest to the Committee, I shall make every attempt to provide them to the Committee at some later time. 31-352 0 -90 -10286 The CHAIRMAN. We are very grateful for your statement this morning. I am sure we will have a question or two momentarily. We now have Tery Baskin, from Little Rock. Tery, we welcome you today. You operate a multi-State buying group called PACE Al- liance, an organization that buys drugs less expensively and passes those savings on to the general public. Tery, we would like to hear your statement today. STATEMENT OF TERY BASKIN, DIRECTOR, CHAIRMAN, PACE ALLIANCE, LITTLE ROCK, AR Mr. BASKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com- mittee. I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today, and make these comments. My name is Tery Baskin, I am a practicing pharmacist. I have been a pharmacist for about 12 years. I was also president of our State pharmacy association in 1985 and 1986. This morning, I would like to address three areas. I would like to talk to you about a workable chargeback system for prescription drugs, I would like to discuss the feasibility of a State Medicaid program using a chargeback system, and also to talk about the use of a formulary to be used in order to lower costs by obtaining bid prices on brand name prescription drugs. The PACE Alliance is a retail pharmacy buying group which contracts with companies in order to achieve lower prices for goods and services used by pharmacies. The buying group currently has about 1,600 drug products on bid. We use a system or series of prime vendor wholesalers to distribute all of our contract items to member pharmacies. We employ a chargeback system to ensure that only members of the PACE Alliance can purchase our contract items at the bid prices. Our prime vendor wholesalers pay their regular price for a product, and if they sell one of these products to a member of our group, they bill the pharmacy, get the contract price, then charge the manufacturer the difference. The PACE Alliance supplies the manufacturer with a list of members, so that when they receive a chargeback from the whole- saler, they will know the item was sold to a member of our group. PACE has been using this chargeback system for the past 4 years. Many hospital buying groups have saved millions of dollars by employing this system for many years. I believe this system would work very well for State Medicaid programs in reducing the cost of brand-name prescription drugs. I think it would be a very simple system to employ. There are three necessary steps. First of all, the State would have to award a contract to a particular company for a certain prescription drug. Second, the pharmacy would pay their regular price for the drug, dispense the drug to a Medicaid recipient and then be paid their normal price by the State. Third, the State would then submit a chargeback to the manufacturer for however many units of that drug that had been dispensed, and there would be a chargeback based on whatever the bid price was. This system has two benefits for the manufacturers. First of all, pharmaceutical companies are familiar with chargeback systems,287 because they currently use it for their contract sales. Second, thecompany would know-it would have an assurance-that the pre-scription had been dispensed to a Medicaid recipient, because theywould only be billed for prescriptions for which the State had al-ready paid the pharmacy. In order for the State to be able to obtain bid prices on brand-name prescription drugs, there will need to be more than just largevolume, there will also need to be a formulary in place. A formu-lary quite simply states which drugs will be paid for and whichdrugs will not be paid for. The decisions regarding which drugs to place on the formularyneeds to be made by a committee of physicians and pharmacists.Patient care must be uppermost in our minds, but enormous sav-ings can be achieved without sacrificing any patient care at all.Normally, obtaining contract prices is dependent upon volume,but that is not the case with prescription drugs. Let me give you anexample of this point. PACE Alliance has over 2,200 pharmaciesbuying from our prime vendors. This represents better than one inevery 30 pharmacies in the United States. However, of our 1,600 pharmacy bid items, less than 10 percentof them are for brand-name prescription drugs. Even though wehave been requesting bids from brand-name manufacturers for 4years now, and we represent far more volume than many smallHMO's and hospitals that have received bids and have contract prices. The difference is that these entities all have a formulary whichgives the manufacturer an economic incentive to bid, because ifthey don't, their products won't be sold or used for these patients.The use of a formulary is not a new idea. It has been used foryears by many hospitals, HMO's, the VA medical system, and evensome State governments for their health departments and Statehospitals. In conclusion, let me state that in order for a State Medicaid pro-gram to be fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars, they should be obtaining bid prices on brand-name drugs. Medicaid programswould not be creating new prices for these drugs, only asking forthe best price that already exists in the marketplace. Thank you very much. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Tery. Dr. Norrie Wilkins is from Minnesota. You are the chief pharma-cist, I understand, Dr. Wilkins for a large Minnesota HMO calledPARTNERS. You have developed some strategies for dealing with,and bringing the manufacturers to, the bargaining table.You have also developed a formulary, I understand. I have it inmy hand and was just thumbing through it to look at your particu-lar formulary you have developed for use in that HMO. We look forward to your statement.288 STATEMENT OF DR. NORRIE WILKINS, VICE PRESIDENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANAGEMENT, PARTNERS NATIONAL HEALTH PLANS, MINNEAPOLIS, MN, ACCOMPANIED BY DR. DONNA SCHMIDT, MANAGER FOR CLINICAL PHARMACY PRO- GRAMS, PARTNERS NATIONAL HEALTH PLANS, MINNEAPOLIS, MN Dr. WILKINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the Com- mittee on Aging, both Dr. Schmidt and myself thank you very much for this opportunity to share with you the business model used by PARTNERS National Health Plans to manage pharmacy costs for managed care members. The PARTNERS program has been both financially successful and instrumental in increasing the quality of drug prescribing for members by focusing management expertise on four critical fac- tors. The first is establishing cooperative relationships. Senator Pryor, I would recommend that you do pursue ongoing discussions with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Second, building a clinical management program that evaluates the cost and effectiveness of medications. Third, we have built a volume pricing program which links clini- cal decisionmaking-and the comments by Mr. Baskin are certain- ly true here-we have linked clinical decisionmaking to the formu- lary process and price negotiations. Fourth, we have built a better managed care model through re- search and development. The mission of the PARTNERS pharmacy program is to be the industry leader in managed care pharmacy, providing quality drug therapy to our members while containing member clients' costs, and producing a profit for PARTNERS. PARTNERS in Pharmacy Management has identified key factors which have contributed to the escalating cost of pharmaceuticals. The first is inflation. In our managed care system, we see drug inflation increasing 1 to 1Y2 percent each month. The second is new drug technology, new drugs in 1988 were 48.8 percent more than their replacement therapy. The third is patient demand-we have seen advertising for new medications to our members which has increased the demand for expensive new products. In a managed care model, since most pa- tients pay on a co-payment level, the members and the physician have been insulated from prescription prices. The fourth reason is physician prescribing. The drug industry spends millions of dollars yearly to influence physician prescribing. The business model that we adopted at PARTNERS is to control and manage the pharmacy benefit at those four key points. Phar- maceutical managed care systems must be able to control drug costs by establishing management programs that address each of those influencing points and associated costs. Therefore, the PART- NERS model was built to support and maintain strong, balanced relationships between the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the phy- sician, the patient, and the pharmacist. The success of this program is founded on the establishment of a clinical pharmacy program which is directed by Dr. Donna289 Schmidt. The goal of the clinical services division of PARTNERS in Pharmacy Management is to provide a method for defining, assess- ing, and improving the efficacy, safety, and costs of drug usage in the members that we serve. The objectives of the clinical staff are first of all to establish ra- tional prescribing guidelines, to minimize needless expenditure of resources, to increase physician awareness of efficacy and safety, to serve as a research team to oversee and prevent prescribing prob- lems, and to redefine and develop reporting systems. The products of our clinical pharmacy division are first of all the formulary. The formulary is the list of drugs that we find to be re- imbursable in our managed care model. As part of the formulary, we have what is called a drug update, which is a monthly newslet- ter to our physicians. That newsletter explains the policies and pro- cedures of the formulary process. We have linked the clinical part of our program with the price negotiation part. PARTNERS has negotiated directly with over 30 pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain discounts on the volume of medications used by our nationwide network of HMOs. These discounts were obtained by integrating clinical information concerning the value of medications with cost information. Because PARTNERS has been successful in driving prescription volume by influencing physician prescribing behavior, by establish- ing ourselves as credible drug experts, by establishing ourselves as reputable pharmacy researchers, and by building an information system which guarantees data integrity, manufacturers have been persuaded to participate in our volume purchasing program. I might add that when we began the program 4 years ago, only two manufacturers were participating in the program. But through building a relationship of mutual trust and respect between the pharmaceutical industry and managed care, we have grown the volume pricing program to over 30 manufacturers. In conclusion, I would like to say that PARTNERS feels that we have a responsibility to manage health care and deliver high qual-ity pharmaceutical benefits at an acceptable cost. To formulate this strategy, we have balanced the internal and external forces affect- ing drug decisions. This has not been a trivial task and I think the work before this committee is certainly immense. What you will need is a creative management effort that has been guided by the business model that we have presented today. To summarize, we at PARTNERS believe that the managed care models and principles that we have tested and proven, building co- operative relationships, establishing a clinical management func- tion, establishing a good relationship with the pharmaceutical in- dustry and pursuing volume purchasing, and by funding efforts on research and development-I really believe that this committee can pull from the ashes the Medicare catastrophic bill and estab- lish a drug program that is affordable and is of high quality for elder Americans. Thank you, and we look forward to helping you in this effort. [The prepared statement of Dr. Wilkins and Dr. Schmidt follows:]290 WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF NORRIE WILKINS AND DONNA SCHMIDT PARTNERS NATIONAL HEALTH PLANS In response to the committee's request, we are submitting background information on the business model used by PARTNERS National Health Plans to manage pharmaceutical expenses within a managed care environment. The information presented is based on our experience in managing the pharmacy benefit for our 2,000,000 HMO and PPO members in 33 states. I. BACKGROUND PARTNERS is the unique and exclusive joint venture between AEtna Life Insurance Company and VRA Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Voluntary Hospitals of America, Inc. (VHA). PARTNERS started in 1985 with 35 employees, one client and 3,381 members. Four years later, it has more than 2,500 employees, 10,800 clients and 2.2 million members in 33 states. PARTNERS major goal is to work with providers to manage employer's health care costs for their employees. In order to meet this goal, PARTNERS markets two primary products: Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). In 1985, PARTNERS PPOs served one metropolitan area; as of today, we serve over 100 areas with more than 980,000 members. PARTNERS entered the HMO market in 1986. Through a combination of acquisitions and development, we currently manage 33 HMOs with an enrollment of more than 1,125,000 member. The pharmacy program that we will describe today was first developed and implemented at MedCenters Health Plan in Minneapolis, Minnesota in October 1986 and is currently operational in over 20 of the PARTNERS HMOs. Historically, managed care has not devoted substantial resources for the management and control of drug costs. The primary reason for this lack of attention is that pharmacy expense usually accounts for 5-7% of the health care premium and hospital expense contributes 35-40% of the premium. Therefore, management resources have been devoted to the area of greatest liability (i.e. hospital). In the last five years, some IPAs, Networks and most staff model HMOs have developed managed care systems which have taken advantage of the cost containment practices in attempting to control drug expense. These cost containment practices include: Formularies (list of reimbursed medications) Mandatory generic substitution (or Maximum Allowable Cost: MAC) Drug utilization review (DUR) Volume purchasing with drug manufacturers291 Managed care systems which have implemented some or all of the above steps have begun to influence prescribing behavior so that physicians, pharmacists, patients, pharmaceutical manufacturers and insurers now have the incentive and responsibility to work together in a cohesive manner. The goal of managing drug costs and improving the quality of overall drug use constitutes a true managed care system. II. PARTNERS PHARMACY MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MODEL PARTNERS pharmacy program's mission is to be the industry leader in managed care pharmacy, providing quality drug therapy for our members while containing member health plan's costs and producing a profit to PARTNERS. _ PARTNERS in Pharmacy Management (PPM) has identified these key factors which have contributed to the increasing spiral of drug costs and the problem facing the American public today of the wasteful use of medications: Inflation -we have consistently seen average prescription cost increases of 1.0% to 1.5% per month. .New drug technologv -pharmaceutical manufacturers introduce new drugs which are considerably more expensive than replacement therapy: 1987 -New drugs cost an average of 32.54% more than replacement therapy. 1988 -New drugs'cost an average of 48.87% more than replacement therapy. Patient demand -advertising of new medications has created a perceived demand for expensive new drugs -Seldane, Tavist-D, Voltaren, etc. when iess expensive and equally effective medications are available. The copayment structure of the drug benefit has insulated patients and physicians from prescription prices. Physician orescribing -the drug industry spends millions of dollars yearly to influence physician prescribing. The business model adopted by PARTNERS to control and manage the pharmacy benefit was to implement a strategy which controls cost at the key areas described above, maximizes provider contacting nationally, allows flexible employer benefit options, balances the effects of pharmaceutical industry detailing and improves the standards of prescription drug use throughout the PARTNERS network. Pharmaceutical managed care systems must be able to control drug costs by establishing a management program that addresses each influencing point of drug use and associated costs; therefore, the PARTNERS model was built to support and maintain strong balanced relationships between these influencing factors:292 .Pharmaceutical manufacturer.Physician/Prescriber .Patient .Pharmacist III. CLAIMS PROCESSING To better manage, PARTNERS has developed a one-of-a-kind, technologically advanced information processing system, using a relational database structure. By monitoring factors such as member eligibility, quantity of a particular drug dispensed, diagnosis and ingredient costs for each claim, PARTNERS can further help maintain tight control over pharmacy claims costs. Perhaps the system's most valuable feature is its flexibility. We realize that each HMO, each employer group and each pharmacist operates within a different set of parameters, each plan has different benefits levels. Furthermore, to detect problems and establish plans of action, the system features fraud and abuse monitoring. IV. CLINICAL PROGRAMS A. Goal The goal of the clinical services division of PARTNERS in Pharmacy Management is to provide a method for defining, assessing and improving the efficacy, safety and cost of drug usage in the members we serve. Objectives of the clinical staff include the following: To establish rational prescribing (correct drug, patient dose, etc.) To minimize needless expenditure of resources by eliminating care which does not increase quality or improve outcome. To increase physician awareness of efficacy, safety and cost issues of drug therapy. To serve as a research team to oversee and prevent aberrant prescribing and intervene if an incident of undesirable outcome becomes apparent. To redefine and/or develop reporting systems. B. Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee PARTNERS in Pharmacy Management utilizes a National Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee to administer the pharmacy benefit in a managed care setting. The committee consists of at least three plan physicians, a medical director, two registered pharmacists and an administrator. Issues that the P&T committee address and serve include:293 .Serving in an advisory capacity to the plan physicians and theplan itself in all matters pertaining to the use of drugs. * To develop a formulary of drugs accepted for use in the plan and to provide for its constant review. .To establish procedures and programs that help ensure cost effective drug therapy. To participate in quality assurance activities related to the distribution, administration and use of medications. * To review adverse drug reactions occurring throughout the plan. To initiate and/or direct drug use review programs and studies and review the results. To advise pharmacies and providers in the implementation ofeffective drug distribution and control procedures. C. Formulary PARTNERS in Pharmacy Management implements a formulary management process for its plans as a measure to help restrain pharmaceutical costs. The proliferation of drugs with similar indications but large variations in cost has caused a disproportionate increase in drug expenditures. The formulary is designed to promote rational drug therapy through inclusion of drug products which have been selected based upon therapeutic efficacy, relative freedom from side effects and cost. The formulary represents a list of drug products that are reimbursed by the health plan. All new drug entities will not be reimbursable until they are reviewed by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. A negative formulary, which lists drugs not reimbursed by the health plan, is also distributed to plan providers. Alternate choices to negative formulary items are listed as a convenience to the physician. A formulary program enhances the quality of patient care while containing costs. D. Generic Substitution Through its formulary management process, PARTNERS mandates the use of generic substitution by enforcing a maximum allowable cost (MAC) program. in order for a drug to be placed on the MAC program, these criteria must be meet: 1. Contain the same active ingredients as the brand name drug. That is, it must have the same chemical in it, but the non- active ingredients like \"fillers\" or color may differ. 2. Be identical in dose, form and method. That is, it must have the same amount of drug, in the same form, such as a tablet, to be taken by mouth. 3. Have the same uses, cautions and other instructions. That is, it must be labeled in the same way and be used for the same reasons as the brand name drug.294 4. The time to absorb and the amount absorbed must be nearly the same. Also, the total amount of drug that enters the bloodstream must be the same for both the generic and the brand name drug. 5. Meet the same batch consistency requirements for identity, strength, purity and quality. That is, each batch of drug mixed up by the generic drug company must meet the same requirements to ensure that you-are getting the same product each time. 6. Must be manufactured under the same strict standards of the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practice regulations as required for brand name drugs. E. Therapeutic Substitution Therapeutic substitution is the use of different chemical entity prescribed for the same disease process to effect the same outcome. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have made \"therapeutic equivalent\" drugs for years and supported studies comparing two different drugs for the same diagnosis. Physicians have always practiced therapeutic substitution when writing a prescription. The controversy now is whether pharmacists can practice therapeutic substitution with or without a physician's approval. Only one state, Washington, allows therapeutic substitution by law. PARTNERS National Health plans does not mandate therapeutic substitution by the pharmacist. However, in certain instances PARTNERS requires the pharmacist to call the physician to request an order change. The physician can then decide whether to prescribe a therapeutic equivalent which would be reimbursable by PARTNERS. If, however, the physician does not agree that the therapeutically equivalent drug will not result in the same outcome, (s)he has two options: 1. The physician can maintain that the patient needs the first drug and the patient must pay full price, or 2. The physician can write a letter of exception for medical reasons to PARTNERS. If there is a true medical necessity, PARTNERS will pay the cost of the first drug minus the copay. Examples of therapeutic substitution would be the anti-ulcer drugs Tagamet, Zantac, Pepcid and Axid. All these drugs are equally effective for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, and side effects are rare. Therefore, cost should be the major factor in the physician's decision. Another example are beta blockers for hypertension. For some patients who do not experience side effects, any beta blocker would be as effective as another. F. Drug Update The Drug Update is a monthly one-page newsletter to provider physicians as an educational tool to promote better prescribing. This newsletter is an extension of the formulary and is written by295 pharmacists and physicians. Many decisions by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee on drug coverage and use are communicated officially to provider physicians in this manner. Important therapeutic issues such as hypertension, heart disease and lowering cholesterol are researched, condensed and edited by physicians in that specialty. Results of drug use evaluations are reported. The majority of physicians are already looking for methods to improve their practice and this newsletter can help them learn to use drugs more efficiently. G. Drug Utilization Review PARTNERS in Pharmacy management has the capacity to access multiple databases to produce standard and specialized reports. This function enables Medical Directors, Executive Directors and their staff to track pharmacy utilization in a variety of ways. These reports and the information system are used to support clinical decision making by this iterative process: Analyze prescribing trends Predict impact of prescribing change State objective of the UR effort Develop criteria to support rational prescribing Collect and analyze data Evaluate the impact Report results V. VOLUME PRICING PARTNERS has negotiated directly with over 30 pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain discounts on the volume of medications used by our nationwide network of HMOs. These discounts are obtained by integrating clinical information concerning the value of medications with cost information. Because PARTNERS has been successful in driving prescription volume, influencing physician prescribing behavior through counter detailing efforts, establishing ourselves as credible drug experts, reputable pharmacy researchers, and by building an information system which guarantees data integrity, manufacturers have been persuaded to participate in our volume pricing program. Building a relationship of mutual trust and respect between managed care and the drug industry has been an important objective of the PARTNERS pharmacy program over the last four years. Managed care practices clearly represent fundamental change for the drug industry from past historical practice. Our strategy in building new working relationships between our two industries has been to foster open discussion and understanding. There have been several drug companies that have been outstanding in their efforts to learn the managed care industry and to adapt their business strategies to participate in a manner where both industries (managed care296 and pharmaceutical) take responsibility for providing quality drug therapy at an affordable cost. VI. RESEARCH AND DEVEWoPNENT PARTNERS goal is to he a ground-breaking loader with -soi sld.solutions to the-_ health care questions of this century, and to influence the directtonrnf managed care into the next century. With this goal in mind, PARTNERS is -ommitted to the ongoing tudy of improved pharmacy managed care model. Four research efforts currently in process at PARTNERS are helping us achieve this goal: The Hartford Grant -to study the effects of drug information to HMO providers on high-risk, elderly patients. This grant was awarded by the Hartford Foundation to the University of Minnesota and American MedCenters (now PARTNERS National Health Plans) in the fall of 1986. It is a three year study with the final report due in December 1989. The objectives of the study are to look at the drug problems in a senior population, establish if/how physician prescribing contributes to those problems and how we can change physician behavior and what effect this will have on the overall health care. H2 Blocker Study -The objective of the study is to understand whether, through a formulary decision making process, we could identify only one of the antihistamine antagonists to be on our formulary (Zantac, Tagamet, Pepcide). The study compares the usage of these drugs in terms of cost savings of drug and hospital stay. Community Pharmacist Project -A feasibility study is in place to examine how we can use the community pharmacist to promote more active patient accountability for proper medication use. Analytical Rating Tool (ART) -ART is a tool used; by PARTNERS to identify the various steps in the formulary decision making process. This tool allows us to justify formulary decisions in a consistent and clinical fashion, and it promotes discussion between pharmacists and physicians as to the relative worth of similar medications.297 VII. PROGRAM EVALUATION PARTNERS has a responsibility to manage a health care system that delivers a high quality pharmacy benefit at an acceptable cost to patients and payors. To formulate a pharmacy managed care strategy, we have balanced the internal and external forces affecting drug decisions. Balancing these concerns is not a trivial task, but a creative management effort that has been guided by the business model presented today at this hearing. PARTNERS has been successful in documenting not only improved financial management but also, and more importantly, we have documented that the quality of pharmaceutical care has improved for our patients. At MedCenters Health Plan alone the program has saved over 5 million dollars in less than four years in drug costs and administrative costs. These savings were achieved by bringing together professionals and industries, that traditionally have not been able to work together, in a managed care environment which fostered and supported cooperative working relationships. In other HMOs around the United States, we have documented financial and quality of care differences in prescribing practices that are at times staggering. We at PARTNERS are hopeful what we can assist this Committee in molding the architecture we have proven to be successful into a national health care system that will provide improved quality of drug use at an affordable cost for all Americans. We sincerely thank you for the opportunity to present the PARTNERS business model to this important committee.298 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Wilkins. I see Senator Kohl entered during your statement. Senator Kohl, would you like to make a statement or ask a question at this time? STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERBERT KOHL Senator KOHL. Senator Pryor, I did want to stop by and say a word. The CHAIRMAN. I understand you are in a Judiciary hearing at this time. Senator KOHL. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be able to stop by and express my admiration for all you have done and the efforts you have put forth on behalf of the poor and the elderly of our Nation. Those efforts have already made a significant difference in the lives of many Americans. I and many other people are deeply grateful to you for your years of service. A solution to the skyrocketing problem of prescription drug costs is critical to our effort to provide universal access to health care in this country. I am particularly concerned that with changes in the catastrophic health care law that millions of low income elderly and disabled now are going to have it socked to them, and socked to them good. It is an embarrassment that many of those who are in desperate need of therapeutic treatment may even have to go outside the bor- ders of our own country to get reasonably priced prescription drugs. I am struck by the absence of the prescription drug manufactur- ers. I am appalled by the apparent lack of desire on their part to be a part of the solution. For those of you sitting in this room who are part of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, I think you need to take back the message that there is an open invitation to work out these problems in a civil and cooperative manner. But you need to know also that our patience is not infinite. We all hope that we will see a bit more cooperation in the very near future on your part. This Senator fully supports the committee's efforts to turn a bad deal into a fair deal. Senator Pryor, my deepest respect and appre- ciation goes to you for all you have done. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kohl, thank you very much. Senator Cohen. Senator COHEN. Mr. Berryman, can you tell us what the ration- ale is for such discrimination in pricing that occurs in Virginia? You indicated, I believe, that it was 1 cent per 100-packet for one State agency, and that rose to as much as $1 at a sister agency? How do you, as a pharmacist, account for that kind of price dis- crimination? Mr. BERRYMAN. Senator Cohen, I can't account for it. The indus- try has to account for it. In Virginia, the Medicaid department ends up paying retail price for the product. The industry has many classes of trade which you as the Congress have permitted under the Robinson-Patman Act.299 There are numerous classes of trade out there, managed healthcare happens to be one of them. It is now becoming one of themajor ones. For-profit nursing homes, not-for-profit nursing homes, for-profithospitals, not-for-profit hospitals-they are all treated the samewithin their particular class of trade. The industry does not recog- nize a retail class of trade, and that happens to be Mr. Baskin'sand my problem at the retail drugstores. I can't answer that question for you, other than to say that theretail class of trade is not recognized. I think one of the possiblesolutions is that you use your influence to at least require the in-dustry to recognize the Medicaid Program across the country as amanaged care program. IL so, my interpretation of what is going on would qualify Medicaid for the pricing. There is nothing muchmore managed in this country than Medicaid. It certainly is thatway in Virginia. We have a very efficient program. Senator COHEN. Can you give any kind of rationale in your ownmind as to why there might be such a differential between what ischarged to a hospital and what is charged to a consumer who is outof the hospital, at a local pharmacy? Mr. BERRYMAN. Again, that is a question that the industry oughtto respond to. -My opinion is that it started out a long time ago,with Veterans hospitals and nonprofit facilities, during World War II, possibly. It has now been expanded into what the industry per- ceives, I believe, as a very effective marketing tool. If they can give their product away and get it on a managed careformulary or a hospital formulary, then those products are writtenfor as they go out into the marketplace at the higher inflated cost of that product., You and I know that it costs them more than apenny to make a nitroglycerin patch. That's pretty obvious. But Ithink that is the strategy behind it, sir. Senator COHEN. Mr. Baskin, your program only applies to Medic-aid, is that correct? Mr. BASKIN. No, sir. Our program is for retail pharmacies. WhatI was describing was our chargeback system which can be used by Medicaid patients. Senator COHEN. Does that mean, for example, that Mr. Green, who is not on Medicaid, could be a beneficiary under your system? Mr. BASKIN. He could very well be a beneficiary of it if the man-ufacturers were within our buying group, which has 2,200 retailpharmacies out there. He would be a beneficiary of it, yes. I wasjust asked to describe how our system could be used for Medicaid.Senator COHEN. I got the impression, reading your testimonythat a list of the Medicaid recipients had to be submitted to themanufacturer, so they would know whether the drug was actually going out to those who could not afford it. Mr. BASKIN. What would happen would be that the Medicaid de-partment, once they had paid a local pharmacy for that prescrip-tion, would bill the manufacturer for the appropriate number ofunits. If you dispensed 100 tablets and there was a $4.00 charge-back, that would give them some assurance that it was used justfor Medicaid patients. The pharmacist would not be involved inthat.300 Senator COHEN. I would like to ask both you and Dr. Wilkins- how does the formulary work if you have only one effective drug? Dr. WILKINS. If there is only one effective drug for the treatment of a specific disease? Senator COHEN. We have heard some testimony that there is only one effective drug for Mrs. Bivens. What do you do in that sit- uation, where you have in effect a monopoly, where the drug man- ufacturer does not have to deal with you? Dr. WILKINS. In that case, we would use part of our clinical drug program utilization review to see if this drug, which is very expen- sive, is the only drug to treat a particular disease. Then we try to establish rules and systems to make sure that the drug is only being used for that particular disease. If there is only one drug, then you are correct, the drug company has a monopoly, however, there is much one can do and should do on an ongoing basis to ensure proper and appropriate use of that medication, especially since there may be nondrug alternatives for treatment. Senator COHEN. Mr. Berryman, you talked about the State taking some action. I was curious as to why the State has not acted sooner, if you have that kind of differential between one State agency that is purchasing drugs at a higher price level than the other. You talked about the proposal of a rebate program. Is that similar to Mr. Baskin's program? Mr. BERRYMAN. No, sir.. During the last session of the General Assembly, the Medicaid department was mandated to come up with, by the Appropriations Act, $5,500,000 in cost savings. One of the proposals that was submitted by that department was to re- quest manufacturers to rebate 5 percent, I believe, of the sole source products that Medicaid currently pays for. We have had a 71-percent price increase on drugs in the last 4 years. Sole source products make up 87 percent of the dollars spent in our Medicaid program and only about 57 percent of the prescrip- tions written for, but 87 percent of the dollars. It just seems that it was really a takeoff on the chargeback mechanism. It was simply saying \"How about sharing in the burden?\" We were quickly re- minded that there was not statutory authority for such a rebate program in Virginia, and we could not require it. Senator COHEN. Has your legislature been advised that if there is any question as to the authority to have a State-by-State charge- back program, you can run under the Commerce Clause, for exam- ple? Mr. BERRYMAN. In my written testimony, Senator Cohen, I think there is reference to the Virginia State House Committee Bill 403, which is studying the Medicaid Program. They are now looking at, I believe, ways to come up and develop that and have an attorney study that to see if it is possible to initiate that kind of program. Then if we need some statutory legislation passed in Virginia, then we would like to do that. It is possible that this Congress needs to countenance that idea- I am not an attorney-because it may be that it is not just a State problem. It may be a State and a Federal problem. Perhaps some- thing together needs to be done to make sure that something like that can be instituted.301 The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cohen. Those are very good questions. Senator Cohen, in our last hearing on this issue some months ago on prescription drug prices, we singled out and saluted oneFederal agency the Department of Veterans Affairs, for having gone to the pharmaceutical manufacturers directly and said \"All right, we buy a lot of prescription drugs, and we are going to buy them at a fair price.\" As a result, they do. In some cases, we see Medicare paying forthe same drug, the same number of capsules or tablets, and quanti- ty, from the same manufacturer, but at a price that is four to five or even six times higher than the Department of Veterans Affairs. Why does the Department pay less? Because they negotiate. They have brought the pharmaceutical manufacturers to the bargaining table, and as a result, they have seen tremendous savings. I have even suggested off hand and informally that we turn all ofthe drug buying for the Federal Government over to the Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs. Everybody laughs, but I don't see why they should. It would probably save us multi-millions of dollars. But outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs right now weare not exercising the leverage we have. I want to quote some material about doctors from a New York Times article in the Magazine section of November 5, 1989, that isrelated to some of the problems we have talked about today. \"'I can get any drug on the university hospital formulary,' says a territorial sales manager for one pharmaceutical company. 'I justfind some fertile soil, the right person who is hungry for research money, doesn't matter what the side effects are or if it four timesthe price of an equally good drug. I know the researcher will help me get it on the formulary in exchange for research money.' I think what we have here is a cycle of dependency where drugmanufacturers do anything to get their products on a formulary in- cluding taking advantage of university hospitals need for research money. Dr. Wilkins, is it that easy for a drug manufacturer to get his drug in your formulary? Dr. WILKINS. It would be appropriate for Dr. Schmidt to answerthat question. The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Schmidt. Dr. SCHMIDT. I want to reiterate about the formulary. It is notjust for drug manufacturers to get their drug on the formulary. It is also for the physicians to choose the drug. So the physicians arequite involved in our pharmacy and therapeutics committee, saying which drugs we shall use. To me a formulary is not a list of drugsthat prohibits physicians from prescribing what they want, it is a guideline for good drug therapy and quality drug therapy for pa- tients. So we use the medical authority of a large group of physicians to say if it is a valuable drug to put on the formulary. Senator COHEN. Can I ask if there is any system to check wheth-er the physicians get free drugs? Dr. SCHMIDT. Yes, enclosed in our packet, we do have an ethics policy for our pharmacy and therapeutics committee. At least inour national and some local P&T committees, they have to disclose302 what research they have, and what moneys they have received and what trips they have taken. Senator COHEN. So the physicians are not just receiving free drugs to dispense to their patients, and then also promoting those for the listing on the formulary? Dr. SCHMIDT. Well, I can't say that they don't take free drugs. The drug company representative can give them samples that they can give to their patients. We allow that. But we do take into con- sideration who should be voting on a particular drug issue. Senator COHEN. Thank you. The CHAIRMAN. On that point, Dr. Schmidt, let me ask you this. I'm still back in the New York Times magazine section, of Novem- ber 5. The article is called \"Pitching Doctors.\" I am quoting-\"One company, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, requires sales representatives to tote'-I thought that was a Southern word, tote-\"laptop comput- ers into which they enter data on each doctor visited, including notes on his personality, his nurses' and receptionists' names, birthdays and hobbies of key people in the office.\" \"This information is relayed to the company's central computer for use in future efforts to shape an individual doctor's prescribing habits.\" Further in the article, \"As one detail man explains, 'where there are eight drugs that are equally good, the doctor makes a choice based on nonscience. If I drop off samples, pens, other devices, the doctor will write for my product and not the other guy's.'\" Is this still going on? Dr. SCHMIDT. I would have to say yes. I hope that doctors, at least as a large committee on the pharmacy and therapeutics committee, will look at whatever drug is effective, whether it has less side ef- fects, and if those two things are equal, less costs. So when you say equally effective, to me that is only part of the picture. Side effects, availability and cost go in there. We try to say that if there are eight drugs that are equally effective, then what about side effects? What about long-term outcomes? Are we going to use all the resources or more resources with one drug than an- other? Those are the questions that are looked at by pharmacy and therapeutics committees, and those decisions are communicated by the newsletter to individual physicians. They are really taking those decisions as leadership from their peers, for example, nephrol- ogists, for hypertension, to say what therapy should guide their practice. Dr. WILKINS. I would like to comment that yes, indeed, the de- tailing efforts that the pharmaceutical manufacturers have on the physicians is real and is effective in having physicians select cer- tain products. A term we use in managed care to balance those ef- forts is called \"counter-detailing.\" We prepare the drug update, or the drug information that we send to our physicians, in an effort to balance what we know the pharmaceutical industry might be saying related to a certain product. In our HMO environment, it is not unusual for a drug. represent- ative to give a message to a physician that their product is better in some way. Our physicians carry their PARTNERS formulary in their pocket. It is not unusual for the physician to pull out the for-303 mulary and say \"Well, I hear what you are saying, representative from the drug company, but according to the policies and recom-mendations of the PARTNERS Health Plan, that is not true.\" What we are trying to say here is that PARTNERS has devel- oped a very good working relationship and a trusting relationship with our physicians so that our information and policies are supported by the physicians. The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Wilkins, while you are speaking let me ask this. You supplied the committee with some very interesting tables.5I would urge my colleagues Senator Kohl and Senator Cohen to look at this table. It says that in 1987, new drugs cost 33 percent more than the old drugs they replaced. By 1988, they cost 49 percent more than the old drugs they replaced. I would like to know your source for the data. I am not question- ing it, I just think it's fascinating. In your opinion, are these new drugs worth that much more than the old drugs they replaced? Dr. WILUiNs. Mr. Chairman, that information was compiled bythe Dharmacv claims information of the PARTNERS NationalHealth Plans has. Those were on actual paid claims. Those increases really are phenomenal especially in a managed care environment, when you can't raise your premiums that highwithout losing a significant membership. We view this as a signifi-cant problem. When a new drug is announced, we go through a very sophisti- cated, clinically justifiable process to evaluate the worth of that medication. In many cases the increased cost of that drug is not worth the value. In those cases we make a policy decision to eithernot cover the drug, or to restrict the drug for a very narrow market. The CHAIRMAN. The Food and Drug Administration-are theyright or wrong when they say, in their assessment of 84 percent ofthe new drugs, that they have little or no therapeutic potential to improve on existing drug therapies? Is that right or wrong, or nearright, or do you have any way to judge? Dr. WILKINS. I am a pharmacist, so I will put that hat on. I amnot sure that I agree with 84 percent, but I agree that the number is quite high. Dr. SCHMIDr. What we usually do is take a look at what the FDAhas classified as 1C or little or no therapeutic gain over existing drugs. We will put that on our excluded drug list unless physicians come to us and say \"This is something that we really need, eventhough it is classified 1C.\" It is rare that the physicians come to the pharmacy and therapeutics committee and say that. So I would say, yes, it is very high. The CHAIRMAN. Let's go back a moment to Mr. Baskin's testimo- ny. I think from your testimony, Tery, you said drug manufacturers seem to be a little more willing to negotiate the price of multiple source drugs-those drugs without a patent-with retail pharma- cies who buy in groups. What do they do about the patented drugs, do they negotiate those? 5 See p. 758.304 Mr. BASKIN. Basically, they do not. Less than 10 percent of our 1,600 items are brand name drugs. Very few of those-we have 137 exactly-and very few of those are true single source drugs. Those were obtained by getting a bid from a company of all their product line. We had something they wanted, and we said to get that they would have to bid their entire line. But for the most part they do not. That brings up an interesting question Senator Cohen asked a while ago, about why we feel that this is not happening. It is inter- esting to me that Congress created some classes of trade, and it is allowing all this discriminatory pricing to go on, yet the largest purchaser out there, the Medicaid program, can't seem to access it. That is an interesting dichotomy to me. Dr. Wilkins talked about the fact that they are getting these prices. In my testimony I stated that it is not just a volume issue. In our program we are purchasing in excess of $300 million worth of prescription drugs. That ought to be enough volume-I'm not sure what her volume is-but I know in a number of cases, for in- stance in a small HMO in north central Arkansas, I doubt if they have 5,000 people covered entirely. So it is not just a volume issue. There is something I wanted to elaborate on. This was something that was said to me by a government affairs representative of a company. This person was very new on the job, as a matter of fact this was the first call this person had made. We were discussing a variety of things and I asked through what I thought was a stimu- lating question and asked why companies like hers did riot bid the Medicaid Program. She said that they would be blackballed imme- diately. They could not do that. If they were the first company to do that, there would be no way of telling where it would stop. I thought that was an interesting twist. The CHAIRMAN. What did she mean by \"blackballed\"? Mr. BASKIN. Well, I guess that's subject to interpretation, but ob- viously she was saying to us that her company could not afford the heat from the sister companies if they happened to open this dam, if you will. You talked about the situation in California in your opening remarks, that if it started in California, there is no telling where it would end up. There are some real market issues there. Dr. WILKINS. Senator Pryor, may I respond? I would not call the volume program we have discriminatory, but differential. It is not only based on volume, it is based on the fact that our clinical pro- grams are actually affecting the kinds of medications that are se- lected and dispensed to our patients. It is differential. The man- aged care environment has something to give to the pharmaceuti- cal industry, and that is market share. I think in defense of the pharmaceutical industry, having worked with them for over 4 years, it-is -true that there are one or two that started, and then it took a lot of my time and a lot of time of the staff people at PARTNERS to represent our industry to them, so that they could understand our objective and develop that trust and design win-win strategies. All I am saying is that once you develop that trust, there is the opportunity to build programs like this for Medicaid programs. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Berryman, you have testified very eloquent- ly on what is happening in your State, and how you have had to305 cut back on programs because the legislature mandated cuts. Youhave had to take a $5,500,000 out of Medicaid, is that correct? Mr. BERRYMAN. That's right. The CHAIRMAN. Let's go through this list and find out who is par-ticipating in the burden sharing of cuts. The pharmacists? Mr. BERRYMAN. In Virginia, pharmacists have had to accept one fee per month on their prescriptions, so they took their hit.The CHAIRMAN. Hospitals? Mr. BERRYMAN. Hospitals -are already reimbursed at cost. And some of them would contend less than cost. The CHAIRMAN. Nursing homes? Mr. BERRYMAN. They are impacted somewhat on the drug pro-gram. The CHAIRMAN. What about doctors? Mr. BERRYMAN. In our Medicaid program, we have had to goback to the last two sessions of the General Assembly to get appro-priations to get their fees raised. They are now at the 15th percent- ile, and in the next year they will go the 21st percentile.The CHAIRMAN. What does that mean? Mr. BERRYMAN. Reimbursement of their usual and customary fees. That's a major problem in Virginia. Because of our inabilityto pay them properly, we have had physicians drop out of the pro-gram. In southwestern Virginia, which is very rural, in Abingdon, VA, we have no OB people to deliver babies now. At one time wehad a problem in Danville, VA, which is a fairly good sized commu-nity, with no pediatric care. The CHAIRMAN. Let's go to the Medicaid recipients, Mr. Berry-man. Are they are part of this? Mr. BERRYMAN. Medicaid recipients had their co-pays increasedthis time. The CHAIRMAN. So they are participating in the cuts. Mr. BERRYMAN. Yes, sir. The CHAIRMAN. What about the drug manufacturers? Mr. BERRYMAN. To date, the only thing I can say about the drugmanufacturers is that the transdermal nitroglycerin patches, andall transdermal delivery systems were taken off the program be-cause we did not feel like the technology was worth the price of theproduct. I think that's basically the way the legislature felt aboutit. That was a legislative action. So if there has been a hit, that has been the only one.The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Berryman, at this moment, I am going toyield to Senator Cohen and Senator Kohl, and let them ask anyquestions, and I will return in about 3 minutes. Senator Kohl. Senator KOHL. On the one hand, you have, Mr. Berryman, themanufacturers. They distribute the product, they have their enor-mous influence and leverage, and they have their ways of commu-nicating with each other, at functions and trade associations, it isobviously a very vast and powerful manufacturing and distribution system that has as its goal making as much profit as they can,which is what they are supposed to be doing. On the other hand, you have these powerful consumer organiza-tions. Don't you think what we are missing in the country, and Ithink that's what we are discussing today, is the amalgamation of306 these powerful organizations, to see that we get a price that is a fair price, and that we are not simply doing a job at that level of working with each other and using our enormous power and influ- ence to get the job done? Mr. BERRYMAN. I agree with you, Senator Kohl. To a degree the strategy has been to divide and conquer. The pharmacists are on their own and don't have the ability to fight the manufacturers in this country, or in the State of Virginia. Although when we start talking about a restricted formulary, it does not take long for their industry to have all their representatives in Virginia talking to the doctors that they call on, and saying \"Guess what they are trying to do to you at the legislature and at the Medicaid department, they want to restrict the formulary, and you can't prescribe just anything you want anymore.\" Although many of those physicians are working under a formu- lary in a hospital where they have privileges. But they, the indus- try, have the ability to quickly respond and to use their representa- tives in the field to market against whatever Medicaid wants, or the legislature, or whatever they might do to lobby against it. It is a very difficult force. When you can't communicate substantively, it is difficult to re- solve problems. Senator KOHL. I don't think sometimes we are as aware or as sensitive to the enormous power that we have as users to influence the price, if we just use our enormity intelligently. If we don't of course, you could make an argument that we have no cause to blame the manufacturer, he operates in a free market economy and he has a right, within law, to make as much as he can and should. But if we don't organize ourselves to see that we get the best price on the other end, that is not his fault, that is our fault. What do you think, Dr. Wilkins? Dr. WILKINS. I would agree there. Especially in a managed care environment, we do have the opportunity to evaluate drugs and to make decisions as to their worth. It was our responsibility to do that, and once we have done it, we now have the ability to negoti- ate. On the other hand, I believe manufacturers have the responsi- bility to be socially responsible especially for a national problem like making health care affordable. Mr. BASKIN. As far as the ability to use a formulary in my phar- macy in North Little Rock, AR, we have a formulary in my phar- macy. The physicians that I work and practice with, there are cer- tain drugs that we use, and that we don't use. We decide those things. We go through a much more informal process than Dr. Wil- kins is describing, but it is the same type of thing. You are absolutely right, if the purchasers would use their lever- age, it's amazing what they could do. I think that is what you are all looking into, your being the Federal Government and using our money, you are one of the biggest if not the biggest purchasers in the country. I am trying to figure out why the Arkansas State Health Department, that I work as a consultant for in North Little Rock, is paying 42 cents for their birth control pills, and my same State government, through the Medicaid Program, they are paying $15 and up for the same pills.307 Somewhere someone is not carrying their own weight. What Iwould like to see is for the prices to be levelized. If you are going touse a product, if there are costs incurred in that, then you shouldbear those costs. Senator KOHL. Then I guess you could make an argument, and Iam not, but you could, not to blame the manufacturer if one personis willing to pay 42 cents and the other person pays $15-that's theway the market works, right? Mr. BERRYMAN. I would like to interject, that it seems to be thatpractically, because of the class of trade, any managed care groupcan get rebates or whatever. But I think the record of your staffcommittee will show that in Maryland and Kansas, that they didask the manufacturers to bid the Medicaid Program and they didnot. So everybody doesn't have equal access to the bids. Dr. WILKINS. I would argue that unless you have linked yourclinical program with your price negotiations that you really don'thave the power to obtain volume pricing. I don't know the Medic-aid Program, in the two States you mentioned, but if they are miss-ing that part, they are not the same kind of buyer as a managedcare entity. Mr. BERRYMAN. We just had approved in the Virginia Medicaidbudget $500,000 to implement such a program, and we shall soonsee if your statement is correct. Dr. WILKINS. The other point, Senator Kohl, is does the pharma-ceutical manufacturer have the right to charge whatever theywant, and whoever pays for it, that's just free business? I guess myresponse there would be that we all have such a tremendous re-sponsibility to get a handle on the costs of health care in theUnited States that I don't believe anyone can take that sort ofaction lightly any more. Senator KOHL. I don't want you to think that is necessarily myposition-it isn't my position-but when you live in a free marketeconomy you always have to recognize that the person who manu-factures a good just tries to do as well as he can. That's not un-American. It may not be what we want. It seems to me that ourpower, at the other side, is not being used successfully to hold downthe costs of drug increases. We can't just blame the manufacturer.That isn't going to get us anywhere. Dr. WILKINS. That's true. Senator KOHL. I am not suggesting we are. That kind of attitudewould not get us anywhere, if we had that attitude. Dr. WILKINS. I think that's true, also in managed care, where thepurchasers of managed care, the employers and patients, are de-manding that managed care document and justify its prices. Thatkind of balance is good. The more we can create that balance, all ofus would benefit. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Cohen. Senator COHEN. Mr. Berryman, first of all you indicated that once the legislature started to consider various proposals, the drugmanufacturers contacted the physicians and said \"Look what theyare trying to do to your medical practice. You are not going to beable to prescribe this type of drug and get reimbursement for it.\"Mr. BERRYMAN. That s correct.308 Senator COHEN. The consequence is a lobbying effort being made by the local doctors or the AMA, is that what takes place? Mr. BERRYMAN. It is fair to say that physicians don't like re- stricted formularies under any circumstances. They live with them in hospitals. They do fine. I run a hospital pharmacy and the for- mulary is not a problem. It is inconvenient for them to have a re- stricted formulary in their outpatient practices. Senator COHEN. Why is that? Mr. BERRYMAN. Basically because they have to remember that they can't use certain products for certain insurance programs, and it's a very difficult situation because various programs would pay for different products, and they are not the same. It is not univer- sal. That is true in the Medicaid Program. Senator COHEN. Don't most physicians' offices now have those little computers? I think Senator Pryor was talking about laptop computers-- The CHAIRMAN. I was quoting the New York Times. Senator COHEN. Don't most physicians' offices have a computer into which everything is logged? If you have such and such a drug, you will get reimbursed under the following-you punch a key and it prints it out? Mr. BERRYMAN. That's not generally available in a physician's office. Senator COHEN. You don't think that's available in a physician's office? Mr. BERRYMAN. No. I think the technology is there to deliver it, but I do not think that that is generally available in a physician's office. Senator COHEN. They sure have a computer for their billing prac- tices, I can tell you that. Mr. BERRYMAN. That's correct. Senator COHEN. Dr. Wilkins, I would like to come back to the point raised by Senator Pryor in this context. All States are not created equal. They do not have the same distribution of popula- tion. They do not have the same capability that other States might have in putting together private groups or PACE's, or whatever such group may be called. All States do not have the organizational talent, or whatever it might be. They are not all created equal. What would be the major objection to having a central purchasing agency, at the Federal level? Dr. WILKINS. From my perspective, I don't see a major drawback. I think that kind of strategy certainly has some real.merits tocon- trolling pharmaceutical costs. However, having managed the phar- macy benefit in 33 States, I can say that each State is also different in terms of their expectations and in getting them to agree on some sort of standard would certainly be a difficult task. Senator COHEN. Dr. Schmidt. Dr. ScHMIDr. The only obstacle I can see are physicians' local standards of practice are completely different from one State or region to another. So if you were to set up a formulary, that would be bit difficult, to get all the physicians, to agree on what is a good standard of practice nationally for a particular diagnosis.309 Dr. WILKINS. However, it can be done. I think a classic examplethat we have in Minnesota is that in the four major HMO's, thereare four different formularies. So our physicians carry four of thoselittle books around, and they don't have computers in their office to keep track of things. But I do think that any system can account for State variabilityin terms of the standard of practice. It is definitely true that in thePARTNER system, there are standards of practice that are different,and although we have a national drug formulary, we also have theability and flexibility to offer differences at the State level.Senator COHEN. Do you think such a national central purchasingsystem could be set up with the kind of flexibility that is built inby your organization? Dr. WILKINS. Yes. Definitely. Senator COHEN. That's all I have. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cohen. I have one finalquestion, then I fear we are going to have to dismiss this panel. Wewill leave this record of the hearing open for 10 days, if there areany follow-on questions submitted in writing to any of the panelists we would appreciate your response. In a follow-on to SenatorCohen's question, I will throw this idea out. What would happen if Dr. Louis Sullivan, the Secretary of HHS,the members of this committee, the members of the Senate Fi-nance Committee, the Ways and Means Committee and the HouseCommittee on Aging, invited the pharmaceutical manufacturers tothis room, closed the door, and said \"Okay; enough is enough. Weare going to buy these drugs from you but we are going to negoti-ate a fair price.\" What would the response of the drug manufacturers be, giventhe degree of leverage the Federal Government could impose uponthem? What would their response be? Tery. Mr. BASKIN. Well, you are asking an opinion question, so I will give you mine. I think the net result of that would be that you would havesomething that, resembled one price for everybody. I think we havea situation now where- The CHAIRMAN. Do you think that's good? Mr. BASKIN. I think it's wonderful. You have a situation whereyou have a balloon, if you squeeze it on one end, it has to getbigger on the other end, and that is just the simple dynamics ofpressing it hard. The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Berryman. Mr. BERRYMAN. That might solve your problem at the moment,sir, but if there is nothing, no controls put into place after that,then we just go for another round of filing price increases. I am afree enterprise guy. I own my own business. I don't want to see thepharmaceutical industry controlled to the point that the Govern-ment has to set all the prices. But I do think the manufacturersneed to be responsible. I will give you an example. There is a product called Seldanethat came on the market. It is an antihistamine that sells foraround $60 for 100. It came out 3 or 4 years ago. It has a very low310 side effect profile, and does not cause drowsiness and Seldane hap- pened to be a drug that is given every 12 hours. A new product came out on the market called Hismanal. His- manal can be given once a day and it has the same side effect pro- file as Seldane. It is priced almost double of what Seldane was. Now you don't have to be a financial expert to see that that is pric- ing at what the market will bear, rather than what it cost to bring that drug to market, to produce it and develop and market it. I think you have got to do something to make the industry more responsible in that area. A one-time deal does not give you any sav- ings later on. The CHAIRMAN. Speaking of that economic theory, pricing at what the market will bear, do you agree or disagree that the market is at that level right now? Are we reaching that point keep- ing in mind that we are seeing drugs being ordered today from overseas to keep AIDS patients alive, we are seeing a 280 percent increase in the price of Mr. Green's drugs, and we are seeing all of these huge price increases in those instances. Have we reached that level? Mr. BERRYMAN. I think we are approaching that level. I would say to you that we would already have approached it, had not the third parties been paying for the products all along. The consuming public would have refused to pay for the \"me-too\" products, be- cause prices would have been too great. The CHAIRMAN. Ultimately, does not the consuming public pretty well pay for everything? Mr. BERRYMAN. Yes, sir, but it is hidden. The CHAIRMAN. All right. Dr. Wilkins, I wonder if you or Dr. Schmidt would have a quick response to my basic question there about getting all the manufac- turers together in this room? Dr. WILKINS. My comment would be that before you can negoti- ate with the drug companies, you have to build a system first. To my knowledge, that has not been built. You need a system where you have a clinical program, a policy structure and so forth that would allow you to be a negotiator. I certainly would recommend that you sit down with those drug companies, but I-don't know that you are really in a position at this point to bargain. The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Schmidt. Dr. SCHMIDT. I would agree. The CHAIRMAN. You would agree that we ought to sit down with them? Dr. SCHMIDT. Yes, definitely sit down. But they need a structure on how you are going to work and manage through the whole prob- lem, so you won t just solve it in one meeting. It's a long-term rela- tionship. The CHAIRMAN. I thank you, and I thank all of you. Yes, Senator Cohen. Senator COHEN. Mr. Berryman, I was intrigued by your answer to Senator Pryor. I think you said that we would have reached the critical mass as far as market absorption was concerned much ear- lier if there had not been the presence of third-party payors. Is that right? Mr. BERRYMAN. Yes, sir.311 Senator COHEN. So if you take that argument to its conclusion,then, it has been the intervention of the third-party paymentsystem that has prevented a reduction in the price structure muchearlier. In other words, if people had to pay their own bills, theynever would have paid it, and we would not see those kinds ofprices. By virtue of the third-party payment system, we havehidden the costs so that it is always somebody else paying, eitherthrough cost shifting or higher taxes spread among the people, soprescription drug consumers don't feel the immediate impact di-rectly upon themselves. So by the third-party payment system, we have actually in-creased the price escalation over the years, because everybodythought somebody else was paying for it? Mr. BERRYMAN. I believe that. As an example, whether you are aMedicaid recipient or a Blue Cross subscriber, if it costs you $1, $3,or $5 deductible to get a prescription filled, you will have a higherutilization than if you have to pay the entire bill. Dr. WILKINS. Senator Cohen, can I respond to that? I think third-party programs started because people could notafford medication. We have to remember that. An important pointfor all of us, especially in managed care, it is true, we have insulat-ed the patient, the physician, and the payor from true health carecosts and that's why we have to build programs like PARTNERS toensure that awareness and- responsibility for health care costs canbe shared. But I don't think we should say that third-party pro-grams cause the problem. Senator COHEN. Whether or not they caused the problem, theyhave hidden the costs, allowing the costs to continue to escalate,because there is the assumption that somebody else is paying thebill. I would say it applies to many of our insurance programs.In the personal injury field, for example, we have seen and wit-nessed the socialization of injury. We have accidents that the insur-ance company takes care of, and the prices continue to escalate be-cause there is a notion that the company is paying for it. Theyspread the premiums out well beyond your personal risk.You might have an excellent record, and still you are payingvery high premiums, because the risk is being spread-it is beingsocialized such that somebody else is always paying the bill.I am not suggesting that we do away with insurance, but thewhole notion that, under these third-party payment systems, some-body else is paying when in fact we are all paying higher andhigher costs-that's being taken advantage of by those who aresupplying the product. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cohen. Over there is Sena-tor Grassley from Iowa. Do you have a comment or questions? STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY Senator GRAssLEY. Senator, at this point I should not take timefrom the committee except to explain that I was in a markup inJudiciary, and that is my reason for not being here when you com-menced the hearing. I do have a very lengthy statement I want to put into the record.[The prepared statement of Senator Grassley follows:]312 STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. GRASSLEY FOR A HEARING OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING ON PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG PRICING, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1989 MR. CHAIRMAN, AS I NOTED IN YOUR FIRST HEARING ON THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING POLICIES OF THE BRAND NAME DRUG MANUFACTURERS, IT IS CLEAR THAT A NUMBER OF CONFLICTING GOALS ARE AT ISSUE IN THIS MATTER. I SEE NO REASON TO CHANGE MY MIND AS WE START THIS SECOND HEARING. IN MY VIEW, IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS RISKY AND EXPENSIVE TO DEVELOP NEW DRUG ENTITIES. RELATIVELY FEW TRULY NEW PRODUCTS, OF THE GREAT MANY IN WHICH INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, MAKE IT TO THE MARKET. AFTER NEW DRUG ENTITIES DO MAKE IT TO THE MARKET THEY THEN HAVE PATENT PROTECTION FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE CHEAPER GENERIC VERSIONS APPEAR IN THE MARKET. IT ALSO SEEMS CLEAR, TO THIS SENATOR AT LEAST, THAT EFFECTIVE PHARMACEUTICALS RAISE THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE HIGH LEVELS OF INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN PHARMACEUTICALS HAS LEAD, IN RECENT YEARS, ONLY TO A FLOOD OF ME-TOO' PRODUCTS OF NO THERAPEUTIC VALUE SEEMS TO ME OVERDRAWN AND NOT CONVINCING, OR AT LEAST NOT YET CONVINCING. THUS, SO FAR, IT SEEMS TO THIS SENATOR THAT THE CONGRESS NEEDS TO EXERCISE SOME CARE IN ANY LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES IT UNDERTAKES THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO DEVELOP NEW CHEMICAL ENTITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THERE IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN. PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES HAVE RISEN MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE GENERAL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. AND THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE NO QUESTION THAT MANY DRUG MANUFACTURERS FOLLOW A MULTI-TIERED OR SEGMENTED PRICING POLICY THAT GOES BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF WHAT COULD BE JUSTIFIED BY REASONABLE VOLUME DISCOUNTS. SUCH MULTI-TIERED POLICIES CAN HAVE VERY ADVERSE EFFECTS ON PURCHASERS WHO DO NOT HAVE GREAT MARKET POWER: -SUCH AS RETAIL PHARMACISTS, FROM WHOM WE HEAR A GREAT DEAL ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. -SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS DEPENDENT ON PARTICULAR LIFE MAINTAINING SOLE SOURCE MEDICATIONS. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IOWA MYASTHENIA GRAVIS ASSOCIATION, MR. JOHN CARLSTEN, CALLED MY OFFICE YESTERDAY TO SAY HOW PLEASED HE WAS THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS HAVING THIS HEARING, AND TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION NOW FACED BY THOSE WHO HAVE THIS DISEASE AND WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON A SMALL NUMBER OF DRUGS, PARTICULARLY, IN THIS CASE, MESTINON. THE SUBSTANTIAL AND REGULAR PRICE INCREASES IN THESE PRODUCTS, WHICH I JUST MENTIONED, AGGRAVATES THE DIFFICULTIES FOR SUCH PARTIES. AT LEAST ONE MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER HAS TOLD MY STAFF THAT THEY HAVE AN 'EQUAL ACCESS' POLICY FOR ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, FOR ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS. THE V.A. EXCEPTION, THEY ARGUE, IS JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE GREATER VOLUME THE V.A. IS ABLE TO PURCHASE.313 THE QUESTION WHICH ARISES, OF COURSE, IS THAT IF ONE WELL- KNOWN, INNOVATIVE MANUFACTURER CAN FOLLOW AN -EQUAL ACCESS- PRICING POLICY, WHY CANNOT OTHER MANUFACTURERS? I THINK WE ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE A MORE INTELLIGENT PURCHASER OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THIS IS A QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE ASKED, MR. CHAIRMAN, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, AND IT IS A QUESTION WHICH I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ASK. IN FACT, IT IS A QUESTION THAT WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBLITY TO ASK. AND I THINK WE ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO MARE SURE THAT FEDERAL MONEY IS BETTER SPENT IN THIS AREA. AS YOU KNOW, FOR SOME YEARS I HAVE BEEN VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PURCHASES WEAPONS SYSTEMS. CLEARLY, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAKING DRUGS AND PURCHASING WEAPONS. NEVERTHELESS, IT SEEMS TO ME PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO INSIST THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USE THE FEDERAL TAXPAYERS' MONEY TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE PRODUCT FOR THE LEAST MONEY, AND WE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DOING THAT AT PRESENT. I THINK I HAVE TAKEN ENOUGH TIME FOR THE MOMENT, MR. CHAIRMAN. I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE FROM OUR WITNESSES.314 The CHAIRMAN. It looks very lengthy from here. We are going to keep the record open for a few days, Senator Grassley. You have been a long and faithful member of this com- mittee, and we appreciate your joining us at this time. We have had some very constructive witnesses, and some very telling testi- mony. Let me advise Senator Grassley and those of you who may have gotten in later. At 1:30 this afternoon we will reassemble, as many of us who desire to in this room. We are not through. We have another fascinating panel here. This afternoon's session will be an informal discussion where we will all sit together and talk about some of these problems and see if we can come together with a mutuality of understanding and in- terests that hopefully can be implemented into a positive action later. That will be at 1:30 p.m. We will now excuse the panel, and we thank you very, very much. We will call our next panel. We have never had any internation- al witnesses before the Committee in the past that I am aware of. Mr. Guido Adriaenssens, and Mr. Guido Sermeus, I would like to say that we extend on behalf of this committee a very, very warm welcome to each of you. You are from Brussels, Belgium, and are highly respected for your research on international drug price com- parisons. In our earlier hearing, we talked about the U.S. consumer paying the highest drug prices of anyone in the world, and the cost of prescription drugs. I think it would a safe bet to say that whatever you say is going to probably be disputed by the pharmaceutical manufacturers. What you have done is to compare the actual price the American consumer is paying with the actual price of the consumer in Europe. For example, on U.S. prices, you have done away with the sales tax, because in many of our States, probably 40 of our States, there is no sales tax. Similarly, with respect to the European community, you have eliminated the value-added tax on the drugs under ques- tion. So, you have developed and are about to present an interna- tional drug pricing comparison that is as fair as possible, and we look forward to your statement. STATEMENT OF GUIDO ADRIAENSSENS, BELGIAN CONSUMER ASSOCIATION, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to give this interesting comparison between U.S. and European prices for prescription drugs. The comparison took us a long time, but the flights to New York took even longer. It only took 25 hours. I will not get into the methodological details at this moment. I will go straight to the results. We have made a comparison of 25 products, considered to be a representative for consumption as well in the United States as for Europe. Of course, if we could add more data, it would be useful, but we don't think it would change anything essential to this point.315 You told me that perhaps we will have discussions with industryon this comparison. But from the other side, I think there will benot so much discussions because the method we used is in fact onewhich favors the U.S. industry.If we look at those 25 products we compared, a number of times,the United States has the highest prices compared to those inEurope. I will give you one example. A common tranquilizer,Valium, which is 10 times the price in Greece, for example.The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. Do you mean a U.S. citizen pays tentimes the price for Valium that you would pay in Greece?Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Indeed. The average U.S. price is ten timesthe price a consumer would pay in Greece. The highest U.S. pricesare 15 times the prices in Greece.Let me go back to the graph, if you can see this. That graphgives the price index for the total basket of 25 products in eachcountry, when compared to the cheapest country, which we havegiven index 100, that is Greece. Or if you want to have anothercomparison which gives in fact the same details, but perhaps in an-other way, we have compared the total price for these basket of 25products with the European Economic Community average. Wewill see that the average prices in the United States are 54 percentmore expensive than the average prices in the European EconomicCommunity. You can also see from this graph that the prices in the UnitedStates on average are close to those in Germany and the Nether-lands. But I will come back to that point later. The next table givesyou a comparison between prices in those countries who have astrict price control system, and those countries who have no pricecontrol system. The third group consists of Ireland and the United Kingdom,which has a little bit different system. We can come back to thatlater also. I told you that the prices in the United Kingdom seems to be likethose available in Germany or in the Netherlands, but one shouldalso take into account some other elements.First of all, are patients paying for the drugs they have been pre-scribed or is there a reimbursement system and how favorable isthis reimbursement system? We have made a comparison for theEEC. Patients in the EEC normally pay between 12 percent, inGermany, and 56 percent, in Denmark.The elderly pay in general less or nothing at all.A second point of interest is, is the consumption of drugs high?We would like to present two indicators in this respect. First of all,the per capita consumption, and second the percentage of the GNPspent on pharmaceutical products.In both comparisons the United States scores very high and com-parable with Germany. Germany indeed combines, as does theUnited States, high prices with high consumption. Recently, Ger-many has taken measures to reduce this high consumption patternand also to reduce prices of drugs, because the situation becomesunbearable for the national health insurance.As a general conclusion based on these preliminary data, we cansay that the prices for prescription drugs in the United States arevery high. They are comparable to the most expensive countries in316 Europe (the Netherlands and Germany), but in the Netherlands the consumption of drugs is very low, not even half the consump- tion of the United States, and in Germany the patients, as in the Netherlands, pay only a very small contribution per prescription. To give you an idea, in Germany, a patient would pay $1 per pre- scription, whatever the price of it would be. The CHAIRMAN. Let me stop you there. The patient would pay $1 per prescription in Germany. Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes, indeed. The CHAIRMAN. But the price of the drug itself is still according to the charts, much lower than the cost of the drug in the United States, is that correct? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. It will depend on the number and kind of the drug, but in general, the price in the United States is higher. The CHAIRMAN. It is higher in the United States? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes. The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. So in fact, a system in which pharmaceutical companies can set prices as they wish and in which the consumer, which is the patient, or the State, or the insurance company, cannot tackle these prices with normal market mechanisms, as shopping around for the best dealer quality price comparison. It seems to us very unfair. [The prepared statement of Mr. Adriaenssens follows:]317 Association ' , -Belge desConsommateurs Associton Sans But it STATEMENT PREPARED FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING. ORAL TESTIMONY -WASHINGTON DC -NOVEMBER 16, 1989. PART I INTERNATIONAL PRICE COMPARISON BY C. ADRIAENSSENS The Belgian Consumers' Association, which is an independent insti- tute for comparative testing and surveys, has been carrying out several price comparisons on pharmaceutical products for the Direc- torare-General for Consumer Affairs of the European Commission. We have now been asked by this Special- Commtittee on Aging whether it was possible to compare prices of drugs between Europe and the U.S.A. The best way to make such a comparison is to compare all the pro- ducts which are as well available in all countries of Europe and which are also in the a'S.A. available. One should also compare all package sizes, forms-and strengths available. Such a study would take several years of work and enormous amounts of work. As this is not possible we have tried to make samples which are good indicators for the general price level of pharmaceutical products. The sample of products we-used in the EEC-studies is composed of 125 products. This list is composed of the Xtop selling products in each of the 'EEC-Memberstates and represents at least 20 X of sales by value in each country. From tabulations of the PDS Senior Scripts Data provided by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, we have been able to abstract 25 perfect matches. So, we have made a-price comparison for those 25 products. If more data become available (prices for other strengths,package sizes, etc.) we will be glad to incorporate them if the Committee thinks this would be useful. ,this would of course strengthen the comparison but based on our experience we can say that it will not change the results we found until know in a dramatic way. Let's have a look at our preliminary results. Table 1 is a listing of the 25 products with each time the country with the lowest and the country with the highest price. The U.S.A. is never the cheapest and 4 times the most expensive, when we take in account the average US~prices. It would be many times the most expensive if we take the highest prices charged is the U.S.A. for each particular drug. 31-352 0 -90 -11318 Indeed the 1 1 most expensive prices charged for each of the 25 drugs are in average 35 1 more expensive than the average retail prices. If we would not take into account the VAT, which is appli- cable on drugs in most European countries, then the U.S.A. would be the most expensive in at least 7 cases. Table 2 (and the graph) gives the price index for the total basket of 25 products in each country (without VAT) when compared with the cheapest country (- index 100) and compared with the EEC average (- index 100). Average prices in the U.S.A. are 54 % more expensive than average prices in the EEC. The US average prices are comparable to the extreme high prices which are found in Germany and the Netherlands. In table 3 we have brought together some countries those with a strict price control system for pharmaceutical products, those with no price control at all on pharmaceutical products, and the UK and Ireland as a third group because they have a different system which is in between the 2 previous groups. We have now looked at general price levels for drugs but when comparing prices one should also take in account some other ele- ments -Are patients paying the drugs they have been prescribed or is there a reimbursement system and how favourable is this for the patient ? Table 4 gives the results we found in our 125 product comparison for the EEC. Patients pay normally between 12 x (Germany) and 56 2 (Denmark). The elderly pay in general less or nothing at all. -Is there a high consumption in drugs ? We would like to present two indicators in this respect first of all the pro capita consump- tion and secondly the percentage of the GNP spent on pharmaceutical products (table 5). In both comparisons the U.S.A. scores very high and comparable with Germany. Germany combines (and we think the U.S.A. also) high prices with high consumption. Recently Germany has taken measures to reduce this consumption pattern and also to reduce prices of drugs, because the situation becomes unbearable for the national health insurances. As a general conclusion based on these preliminary data we can say that the prices for prescription drugs in the U.S.A. are very high. They are comparable to the most expensive countries in Europe the Netherlands and Germany, but in the Netherlands the consumption of drugs is very low (not even half the U.S.A. pro capita consumption) and in Germany the patients pay only a very small contribution per prescription (2 DM) or less than 1 US dollar).319 iS NOV '89 09:11 TEST-RCHATSAPAKOOP 322535i620 TAbLE I LIST OP PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN IHE COMPARISON AND THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PRICES IN US DOLLARSP.

Thank you very much. We used a chart in our last hearing,6the one in green, to our far left here. This was done by an Italian pharmaceutical manufacturer organization. Do you see any discrepancy in that chart and the chart that the two of you drew up, or the conclusions that you reached here? Are we running about the same? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. I don't think there is any difference between the two charts. Perhaps the figures are different, but that is only due to the methodology. Affecting the first comparison, one com- pares all packages in whatever country they are available. While in our comparison, we only compared the same packages, packages which are available in the United States as well as in European countries. In this comparison for example, the Italian comparison, a normal package in Italy would only have 20 tablets in it, while in the United States a normal package can be 100 tablets. So I think there is a difference in methodology, but as you will, the ranking of countries is almost the same. The CHAIRMAN. In your methodology, you used 100 tablets for 100 tablets in your comparison. Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes. I think our comparison is more favorable for the U.S. industry. The CHAIRMAN. I see. We appreciate you being factual with us. We are trying to get to the bottom of the facts. I failed to mention in my introduction of my two distinguished guests that they both represent the Belgian Consumer Association and biographical in- formation on both of these witnesses this morning will be available upon request. They are highly respected throughout Europe for their published studies on international drug price comparisons, and I know this is a very unique and difficult area to work in. I doubt there are very many people like you in the world who do this, who compare drug prices. Let me ask this about the European manufacturer. Does the gov- ernment or does the individual citizen have access to what you might say proprietary interests of the manufacturer? Does the gov- ernment know about some of the proprietary interests the manu- facturer might own? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. I am not sure I understand your question. The CHAIRMAN. Does the government, in dealing with or in pur- chasing prescription drugs, does the government use facts that per- haps we do not use in the Congress in determining the ultimate price to pay the manufacturer for the drugs? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes, indeed. In many countries in the EEC, the governments decide on the price which seems fair to them, and not the reverse. So in fact, government in all those countries, like Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, also, the government is setting the price of the pharmaceutical products. The industry can make a suggestion, and explain how they come to the price they propose, but in fact, the government fixes the 6 See appendix 1, p. 339.325 price for that drug which seems comparable with other drugs which have about the same ingredients or the same effect.The CHAIRMAN. Does the government in the European countriesthat we see here on your chart, do they negotiate or set a limit onthe profits the manufacturer may make? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes. The group of countries, the U.K. and Ire-land, for example, have a system in which they do not fix the price of one particular drug, but they fix the profit of a company. Thenthe industry can choose themselves which drugs they are going toraise in price, or not. The CHAIRMAN. In this regard, does the government in establish- ing this price, is there any sort of an incentive paid by the govern-ment to the pharmaceutical manufacturers, for research and devel- opment? Do you have any sort of an incentive for research and de- velopment for the manufacturer? Mr. AAIENSSENsss I. think that every government takes into ac-count the insurance of whatever company, not only for pharmaceu- tical companies. They allow reasonable profits, so that they can besure that the companies can introduce new research and pay forthe new research. Because one of the issues in these discussion is often that there should be a strong pharmaceutical industry to counter the Ameri- can industry on pharmaceuticals. The CHAIRMAN. Are American drugs being manufactured in America by American manufacturers being sold today in these Eu-ropean countries at a lower, price than the American consumer is buying that drug? I am not talking about products from Europeandrug manufacturers, I am talking about products made in America. Are they sold in Europe cheaper? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes, in most cases, I think. Over 50 percentcheaper than in the United States. The average price in Europe is 50 percent cheaper. The CHAIRMAN. I assume, and I hope that you had the opportuni-ty to listen to some of the previous witnesses sitting at the witness table. Did you happen to hear the gentleman from New York when he was talking about members of that community that he represents having to get drugs from Europe to sustain their lives? Was that asurprise to you, or was that a revelation? Or is this something ac- cepted and acknowledged in the European market? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. I think it is known in general that U.S. pricesare high, and the inverse, that drugs are cheaper in Europe. So it is always a good deal if someone can buy a drug in Europe ratherthan in the United States. The CHAIRMAN. We have about 20 to 25 major manufacturers. I would call those the major ones, there may be many more, and Ihope I am not misstating that. But they are the larger manufactur- ers. How. would you compare the profits of the American pharma- ceutical to the manufacturer of pharmaceutical products in Europe? Are our profits to the companies higher, or lower? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. It's a problem which is hard to discuss, be-cause it is not always clear what the profits are on pharmaceutical products. There is a lot of transfer pricing. To give you an example, a drug can be produced in the United States, exported to Belgium,326 and from Belgium exported to France. Then it can be re-imported to the United States. In each step the price can become higher. The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask this question. We talked about one particular drug. This is the drug Eldepryl. This is the drug used by Mrs. Bivens, discovered in 1964 in Hungary. An American fund may buy this drug, this pill is sold in Italy for 41 cents a capsule, $1 in Canada and $2:38 in the United States. Mrs., Bivens pays five times the amount they would pay in Italy. Why the great disparity of price differential? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. The most important explanation is that in the U.S. prices can be set as wished by the pharmaceutical indus- try, and we can perhaps talk about how they do that. In Italy, on the other side, the price is decided on objective facts which have to be submitted by the pharmaceutical industry to the government. The government decides on whether the figures they have are fair or not. The CHAIRMAN. Does the average American consumer spend more or less than the European for prescription drugs. Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. He spends clearly more. The CHAIRMAN. Do we use more or less than the average Europe- an? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. The consumption is higher, yes. U.S. patients have a higher consumption as well in price as in number of tablets. The CHAIRMAN. Are we the highest in the world in consumption that you know of? Do you have a figure on that? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes. I don't think your prices are the highest. As you have been several times in the past, you are beaten by the Japanese. The CHAIRMAN. By the Japanese? Okay. Let's look for a moment at the Netherlands. They are the only ones on the chart that seem to be paying a higher price than Americans. Why is that? What has happened in the Netherlands? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. In the Netherlands, the prices are very high, they have a very free system. The patient doesn't bother because they are all reimbursed. They all pay something around $1 for each prescription. And the consumption in the Netherlands is very low. So if you look at the expenditure per person, or patient, in the Netherlands, the total expenditure is only half of the expenditure of an average U.S. citizen. The CHAIRMAN. If you came over-I know you did not cross the Atlantic, and I hate that the flight took so long, 25 hours-if you came over to give us advice, although I know you are here to state facts, would you advise us if it might be time for us to negotiate as a government with the manufacturers of our prescription drugs and try to get a better price? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes. I think in every free market there is a purchaser and someone who produces the products. The negotia- tion also comes from both sides. It seems unfair to have a system in which only the producer can fix prices, and the patient or purchas- er cannot negotiate. The purchaser can be the patients or the gov- ernment or the insurance company. The CHAIRMAN. You are stating-once again, I want to get this figure right-we have excluded the sales-taxes, value added taxes, there is about a 54-percent increase in drug prices over that or327 higher cost paid by the consumer than the average European coun-try, is this correct? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Yes. The CHAIRMAN. The price controls in the European companies,have they helped? What has been the effect of price controls in theEuropean countries? Mr. ADRIAENSSENS. Perhaps my colleague can explain this.The CHAIRMAN. Certainly. Mr. Sermeus. STATEMENT OF GUIDO SERMEUS, BELGIAN CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION Mr. SERMEUS. Perhaps I can give you four different ways whichare used in Europe to try to control expenses for drugs. I have tosay first, that in general the main argument from the pharmaceu-tical industry is that by using those mechanisms the government isdestroying free market competition which is, as has already beendiscussed here, complete nonsense. Because the basic conditions for a free market mechanism arenot fulfilled. Doctors are prescribing those drugs, but they don'thave-to pay for it. Patients are consuming them but they only haveto pay a small part of it. Several studies in Europe show that thedoctors or practitioners are not even aware of the price of thedrugs. The only thing they know, and that's very important, since inEurope, which is different from the United States, almost all of thecitizens, not only lower income groups, but almost all of them, arecovered by social insurance systems which pay for medical careand alsoJlor drug reimbursement, is whether a drug is reimbursedby the sciarl security system or not.In general, a doctor will try to prescribe drugs for his patientswhich are reimbursed. That's very important. Because that's thefirst way to try to control drug prices. There are different categories of drugs-being reimbursed in oursocial security systems, and most all of the countries have differentcategories. One of them is called vital drugs. For that kind of drug,there is not even a negotiation between the pharmaceutical indus-tries and government, because those drugs are being reimbursedand the government, or the social security system, who pays forthose drugs, will accept a certain price or even determines theprice. Another possibility for less vital drugs is that the government orthe State gives the choice to the pharmaceutical companies wheth-er they can lower their prices and put it in the reimbursementsystem or whether they can increase the prices resulting that thesocial system will not pay for those drugs. Then it is up to the industry to make the balance, whether theycan ask high prices and have a small volume, or whether it is moreequitable that they have lower prices with high volume. In thatcase doctors will prescribe more of those drugs.That's one very, important thing, because setting the prices ofdrugs and reimbursing the drugs were two different topics. Moreand more in all the 12 member States of the community at the328 moment, there is an interference because the reimbursement system seems to be a very effective controlling system for putting the prices down. The pharmaceutical industry knows that very well. A second mechanism that becomes used is trying to control the prescription behavior of the doctors, by informing them in different ways, and also by making profiles of their prescription behavior. If a certain group of doctors who have basically the same kind of pa- tients with the same kind of diseases are on the top level of eco- nomic aspects as far as direct reimbursement is concerned, they have to justify it. It goes even so far in certain countries that they can be sanc- tioned. The sanction can be that they are put out of the social re- imbursement system, and that's very effective, because a patient knows if a doctor does not belong to the system, since the patient will then have to pay 100 percent for the prescription. That's very important. A third way to control prices is giving the pharmacists the right of making a substitution on the prescribed drugs. Of course, that is very controversial, because -here the pharmaceutical industries and the doctors are aware that they are not free to use their therapeu- tical freedom as they want to do. Of course, in our opinion, it is just a question of information, be- cause if there are equivalent drugs which are as safe and effective as more expensive ones, there is no reason to try to use that method to control drug prices. For instance in Germany this is im- portant, since in Germany as well as in the Netherlands, the prices are very high. Our comparison is based on prices from January this year, but by that time, everything evolved very quickly. By control- ling the prescription behavior of the doctors, also in Germany now, and by giving more and more rights to the pharmacists to substi- tute the prescriptions, they are trying to put the prices down also. So it is very possible that at this moment, if we were to redo the comparison, the prices for Germany and the Netherlands would be lower, so that-the difference between the United States and those most expensive European countries is much higher. That might be very possible. The CHAIRMAN. I do apologize. I have reached a point that in about 1 or 2 minutes I will have to leave. If you would conclude your statement, I would appreciate it. Any other follow-on you would like to have placed in the record, this certainly will be placed in the record at the appropriate place. -Mr. SERMEUS. I will conclude with the fourth way of trying to control prices. That's what has been called here the use of formu- laries, what we call positive and negative lists. Positive lists may have the effect of stimulating doctors to prescribe those drugs. Neg- ative lists are really drugs which are not becoming reimbursed anymore. Those lists are sent to all practitioners. I think those are the four most important ways to control pricing mechanisms in Europe.

Part II: Some general trends related to drug prices and drug reimbursement in Europe -by G. Sermeus 1. The pricing of drugs The pricing of drugs as practised within the E.E.C. member countries is very characteristic for each individual country. This means that the pricing structure of no one country is identical to that of another country. There is no doubt that this is related to the fact thatsa great many variables as wellas a wide range of specific conditions must be taken into consideration for the determination of prices. It would therefore not be possible to discuss and compare the complete pricing mechanism for each country on an idividual basis. Even a limited compa- rison based on global trends would be inappropriate since one same country can be subject to different trends according to a wide possible range of specific conditions. The following may be interpreted as a theoretical framework of pricing mechanisms. 1.1. manufacturer's price 1;1.1. determination of manufacturer's price 1.1.1.1. price controlled by law 1.1.1.2. government approves price proposed by private intiative 1.1.1.3. no governmental control 1.1.2. future increases in manufacturer's price 1.1.2.1. with basic governmental interference 1.1.2.1.1. no governmental control 1.1.2.1.2. governmental control 1.1.2.2. without basic governmental interference 1.1.2.2.1. no governmental control 1.1.2.2.2. governmental control _ I de Sq 210408531 .f: n SM71330 tR 089 15 TEST-ACHATS/WWOOP |1. 2. wholesaes 1.2.1. governmental control of no obligatory distribution 1.2.3. levelP.12/20 control of margin 1.3.1.1. yes 1.3.1.2. no 1.3.2. type of margin 1.3.2.1. percentage (fixed or variable) 1.3.2.2. other approach 1.3.3. margin level 1.4.1. uniform rate applicable 1.4.2. more than one rate applicable 1.4.3.

Each country has its own system which has been developed historicallyand which has undergone changes over the years, due principally to sociallymotivated considerations and configurations. Such an often fundamental diversityof principles and regulations does not facilitate the drawing up of an inter-national comparison. In order not to become lost in a maze of individual charac-teristics, it is necessary to restrict the comparison to some fundamental prin-ciples, and in doing so to remain aware that this may only be considered ageneral framework, and sometimes scarcely even that. There are currently still differences in the systems of direct and indirectreimbursement of the cost of drugs to the patient. The ter \"direct\" implies thatthe cost is borne by a third party. This means that the pharmacist will onlycharge his or her customer the relevant personal contribution and that for theremaining amount of the cost incurred he or she will apply directly either to thegovernment health insurance institution or to the private health insurancecompany. Sometimes, the method of reimbursement depends on the type of insurance. E.g.health insurance fund patients benefit from the system in which the third partypays the balance of the cost, whereas private health insurance beneficiaries mustfirst pay the full price to their pharmacist and recover part of the cost incur-red thereafter. Sometimes, the patient will only receive the reimbursable proportion of the costat the end of each calendar month on production of proof of the expenses he orshe has actually incurred. Returning to the prime motivation for reimbursement, i.e. the development of ahealth care system which is accessible to all strata of the population, it may benoted that such a system will vary according to the level of the material infirmi-ty of the beneficiaries. This results in a range of subsystems within an overallsystem. Many regulations may today be classified according to whether they haveremained as such or have been further developed and updated. These variables cantherefore be used as a second discriminating factor. Such provision for sub-groups within the system implies different proportional reimbursement levels ofthe costs incurred, ranging from a contribution which increases according to thegroup concerned to the completely free supply of drugs.334 15 NOV '89 09:18 TEST, PTS 323P 6 P. 17/2 Another discriminating factor must be described from a historical perspective. Originally, the supply of drugs was equivalent to the supply of extemporaneous preparations by the pharmacist. Over the last few decades this concept has changed completely. Extemporaneous preparations have been completely superceded by proprietary medicinal products. These are the product of industrial research and development. Industrial activity on this front has diversified into a large number of specialist groups, with the result that a very wide range of drugs are now available. This in turn has resulted in the fact that, in most of the coun- tries concerned, restrictions have been imposed on the reimbursement of the cost of proprietary medicinal products. Thus a limited number of drugs were selected which would be eligible for reimbursement. The most frequently recurring criteria for the selection of these drugs are prescription only drugs exclusively, quali- tative improvements and improvements in terms of cost effectiveness. The fourth and fifth factors are to be found in the way the reimbursement system hes been structured and in the level of reimbursement relating to a group or category of drugs. There are actually two main systems as far as the reimburse- ment structure is concerned. Certain countries determine their reimbursement according to a percentage of the retail price. This means that the patient's personal contribution will increase as the price of the drug increases. Other countries determine that a fixed amount must be paid for each item sup- plied. The fifth factor has already been mentioned as the reimbursement level relating to a specific category of drugs. This system is based on a structure of qualita- tive interpretation used with respect to the reimbursement of the cost of drugs. The government and/or the health insurance systems divide the drugs into several categories, mainly according to criteria based on the sociomedical usefulness of the various product groups. For example, essential drugs, socially and therapeu- tically useful drugs, etc. As the category declines in importance, the personal contribution of the patient increases. These five factors may be considered as the most significant determinants for the reimbursement schemes ultimately implemented. It is worthy of note that there is never any question in any of the countries concerned of a completely generalized system of free drug supplies, i.e. full reimbursement. It should also be added that, in addition to having a cost saving effect, these measures are also inten- ded to increase awareness and promote more rational prescribing habits on the part of doctors. The modified reimbursement system does not need to be in con- flict with the interests of the patient in terms of the quality and quantity of drugs prescribed. at least not if the system is to be used by those providing the health care in the moet satisfactory and efficient manner. The following table locates nine of the twelve member states on their position within the above discussed five-parameter scheme (situation between 1984 and 1987).335 15 NOV 'E9 6: 19 TEST-ff4TSraoop 32256620 P. 1/20 Schematic summary of the drug reimbursement systems .w 0 - direct reimbursement system X X X X X X 84 m-- ----- --_ .-.-- __no> :' mixed (direct + indirect) X X X tE _ (1) _ (2) (3) 8 U .system of subcategories 4 X X X w uniform application of system X _ x _ selection of products X X X X X X X X (reimbursement lists, (4) '40 -- S ----_________. -- - -- ___. ____ ____ _____ _____ ____ ____-_____no selection of products |.

This applies in particular to the more expensive drugs. The major obstacle to this is the resistance, on grounds of prin- ciple, on the part of the pharmaciscs to agree to comply whole- heartedly with this. (2) The groups of persons who are reimbursed accordlrag to a system of acaesses may be classified under the system of indirect reimburse- mrent. Thus, this applies to reimbursements made ithin the Drug Refuod Scheme and the Voluntary Health Insurance. In contrast to this, the persons who are reimbursed within the Geoeral Medical Service and the Long-Tern Illness Scheme must be classified under the system of direct reimbursement. (3) Health insurance fund patients are included in the system of direcL reimbursement. Private health insurance beneficiaries are included under the system of indirect reimbursement. (4) The selection which cakes place in Ireland means only in fact that all OTC drugs are excluded from reimbursement. Thus no rescrictions are imposed on ethical drugs, except that the cost of drugs which are assumed to be administered only under strict and constant expert supervision, i.e. in hospital, will not be reimbursed for out- patient use. (5) Allndrugs which are not advertised directly to the general public are eligible for reimbursemeut through the N.H.S. (6) A genrial-conditiounfor reimbursement which applies in all countries is thatcthe costwf drugs will only be reimbursed if they are supplied on grescrlption.

(8) Should the fixed annual total for drugs supplied reach a specific amount, which was fixed at 125 Guilders for 1984, then no additional personal contribution is payable. (9) The application of forms of personal contribution are found within the D.R..5 and the V.H.I. An excess is applicable within the D.R.S. which results in a contribution of a percentage of the total retail price paid by the patient per month, insofar as this monthly amount exceeds 28 Punt, and also in a fixed amount of 50 pence to be paid by the patient per prescription, irrespective of the numbar of \u00b1temm on each prescription. The V.H.1. is exclusively characterized by a reimbursenent which is again a percentage of the total retail price paid by the patient during the month, applicable once the monthly total exceeds 23 Punt. (10) Within drug category B, the patient pays a fixed amount of I 000 lire per prescription, irrespective of the number of items up to a maximum of three items, in addition to a personal contribution of 15% of the retail price, up to a maximum of 20 000 lire per drug. In the theoretical drug category C, the patient only pays a contri- bution of I 000 lire per prescription, similarly with a limit of three items per prescription.

DC 20510-8400 June 2, 1989 Mr. Dennis M. Styroky (904 E) ChJef, Pharmaceutical Products Division Department of Veterans' Affairs Marketing Center P.O. Box 76 Hines, IL 60141 Dear Mr. Styrsky: On Thursday, June 22, 1989, the Senate Special Committec on Aging will convene a hearing on the subject of prescription drug manufacturer pricing policies and practices. I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to appear before the Committee to testify on this subject. I also request that you provide the Committee with materials, described below, which will assist us in our examination of this important issue. This hearing will examine factors contributing to prescription drug cost increases in recent years, and explore opportunities in the current marketplace for third party payors, -service providers and others to negotiate prescription drug purchase prices with manufacturers. .Examples of negotiated prices of interest to the Committee include price discounts afforded by manufacturers to government agencies, such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and Department of Defense, and to health care providers and buying groups, including hospitals, Health Maintenance Organizations, and retail pharmacies. Committee Members would appreciate hearing your views on a number of issues related to prescription drug pricing, based upon your experience in managing the DVA's prescription drug procurements for many years. In particular, your testimony should address the following questions: 1. Please provide the most recent price paid by OVA for each of the prescription drugs listed on the enclosed schedule (please note that this list is identical to the list provided to you by Committee staff on May 30). To facilitate our analysis of this data, please provide this information-toCommittee staff by close of business on June' 9, 1989. 2. In general, what is magnitude of discounts realized by VA (expressed as a percentage of the Average Wholesale Price published in the U.S. at the time of DVA's purchase) as a result of its negotiations with manufacturers for procurement of (a) multiple source and (b) single source prescription drugs? 3. During the period 1981 -1988, what has been the approximate annual rate of increase in prices paid by OVA for those prescription drugs purchased through negotiations with drug manufacturers? 4. Does DVA sometimes find it necessary to purchase prescription drugs at prices which are not negotiated with the drug manufacturer? If so, please indicate the reasons and/or circumstances under which DVA would purchase a prescription drug at a non-negotiated price, and the price paid (or basis for establishing the price paid) by DVA for prescription drugs under these circumstances. 5. What problems has the OVA encountered in attempting to negotiate favorable prices with manufacturers of multiple source and single source drugs? How has OVA attempted to resolve these problems? 6. In preparing for or conducting negotiations with prescription drug manufacturers, does OVA utilize information on prices paid by other governmental purchasers of prescription drug products (a) in the United States and (b) by foreign governments? Would such information be useful to DVA in its negotiations? 31-352 0 -90 -12350 The Committee's hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. in room SD-562 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. I would very much appreciate your providing the Committee with ten copies of your written testimony by close of business on June 19, and an additional 100 copies on the morning of June 21, 1989. Your testimony for submission into the record may be of whatever length you deem appropriate. The Committee would, however, appreciate your limiting oral remarks to no more than five minutes. Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in this inquiry by the Committee.

ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 2! Generally the Department of Veterans Affairs obtains discounts averaging 41% for single source prescription drugs and 67% for multiple source drugs when measured against Average Wholesale Price. These prices represent the cost to a federal customer through commercial distribution channels and not drugs owned and distributed by the Government. For the drugs identified as depot stocked, the single source pharmaceutical products vary in discount from Average Wholesale Pricewith a low discount of 22% and the best discount of 90%. The variance is based on the manufacturer's pricing policies and willingness to negotiate for a market they possess. For multiple source drugs discounts range from 39% to 93%, but most multiple source drugs are currently being purchased with discounts of greater than 80% from Average Wholesale Price. QUESTION NUMBER 3: During the period 1981 -1988, what has been the approximate annual rate of increase in prices paid by DVA for those prescription drugs purchased through negotiations with drug manufacturers? ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 3: The cost of drugs from 1981 to the present can only be tracked for items in our depot distribution system. It is difficult to generalizethe trend in cost as a firm increase or decrease because variables such as competition have a dramatic effect. It is relatively safe toidentify single source drugs as increasing annually. Multiple source drugs have declined in the depot system an average of 51.7% below prices that were paid in 1981. QUESTION NUMBER 4: Does DVA sometimes find it necessary to purchase prescription drugs at prices which are not negotiated with the drug manufacturer? If so, please indicate the reasons and/or cicumstances under which DVA would purchase a prescription drug at a non-negotiated price, and the pricepaid (or basis for establishing the price paid) by DVA for prescription drugs under these circumstances. ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 4: The individual VA Medical Centers do on occasion purchase drugs andpharmaceuticals at non contract prices. Most often this is the resultof an emergency requiring a local purchase from the nearest wholesalerto satisfy the critical need that has generated the action. Pricingunder these conditions may result in a cost to the pharmacy as high as 300-400% greater than depot or Federal Supply Schedule cost for the same drug.370 QUESTION NUMBER 5: What problems has the DVA encountered in attempting to negotiate favorable prices with manufacturers of multiple source and single' source drugs? How has DVA attempted to resolve these problems? ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 5: The single problem encountered in negotiating with -manufacturers generally relates to the market share Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers represent. A decade ago, VA was 1 of the 5 largest customers to the pharmaceutical industry. Today, due to the consortia, buying groups and Health Maintenance Organizations, it is not even among the .10 largest buying organizations in the United States for drugs and pharmaceutical products. The most adverse situation we face is the select group of manufacturers choosing not to enter into either a Federal Supply Schedule or provide their proprietary items to the Department for depot stock. QUESTION NUMBER 6: In preparing for or conducting negotiations with prescription drug manufactures, does OVA utilize information on prices paid by other governmental purchasers of prescription drugs products (a) in the United States and (b) by foreign governments? Would such information be useful to DVA in its negotiations? ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 6: In preparation for single source drug negotiations, we obtain as much information as possible concerning the current pricing of the drugs for which we are contracting. This is accomplished by reviewing commercial publications such as the \"Drug Topics Redbook\" and a monthly publication which provides updates on brand name prices from \"Medispan\". We also review the current Producer Price Index and prior year pricing as a minimum to prepare ourselves for negotiation. -Generic drugs are reviewed the same way, but there is no question that the existence of competition is the driving force in negotiating the best prices for generics. Market awareness and price analysis confirm the reasonableness of the contract award, but, if the offerors were not in direct price competition, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be in a less advantageous position. The Waxman'Hatch Act has had a positive .influence in stimulating the introduction of generic drugs and the effect is very noticeable. Competition and large volume are the keys to favorable prices. Our negotiations are always carried out with the best interest of the Government in mind while recognizing the need for a \"win/win\" end result. The Department of Veterans Affairs negotiates and manages its Federal Supply Schedules for drugs and Pharmaceuticals under the format prescribed by the General Services Administration. Obtaining a Federal Supply Schedule contract for a proprietary product line on a multiple award schedule requires the disclosure of discounting practices for all classes of. trade. Bidders complete a Discount Schedule and Marketing Data section of the solicitation with this information. We have developed a computer program which performs a price analysis of the drugs and compares the .Government's position to the \"most favored customer\" supplied by the. offeror. It also determines a negotiation objective for Government based on the analysis and prices offered other customers. The use of this program has enhanced our ability to negotiate under the Federal Supply Schedule and obtain better pricing for the Federal customer. Our generic drug Federal Supply Schedule identifies the specific items we intend to have under contract. Offerors provide a price only. Since no disclosure data exists, we determine an average commercial price from all suppliers identified through the \"Redbook\". This represents the maximum price determined reasonable for Government, and negotiations are conducted with suppliers to obtain an.equal to or better price. If this is attained, the item is awardable. If not, no award is made to that supplier. our Federal Supply Schedule assignments -are of the multiple award type because there are subtle differences even in therapeutic equivalent drugs. Buffering agents and _ablet compression can beg variables that are not addressed by the compendia.371 b AoMi f. ,1_ Sw ice a o tOwe Oto a.nited States $mate SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING WASHINGTON. DC 20510-6400 June 6, 1989 Mr. Gordon Binder Chief Executive Officer Amgen, Inc. 1900 Oak TerraceNewberry Park, CA 91320 Dear Mr. Binder: On Thursday, June 22, 1989, the Senate Special Committee on Aging will convene a hearing on the subject of prescription drug manufacturer pricing policies and practices. I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to appear before the Committee to testify on this subject. I also request that you provide theCommittee with materials, described below, which will assist us in our examination of this important issue. -This hearing will examine factors contributing to prescriptiondrug cost increases in recent years, and explore opportunities in the current marketplace for third party payors, service providersand others to negotiate prescription drug purchase prices with manufacturers. Examples of negotiated prices of interest to the Committee include price discounts afforded by manufacturers to government agencies, such as the Veterans' Administration and Department of Defense, and to health care providers and buyinggroups, including hospitals, Health Maintenance Organizations, and retail pharmacies. You or your representative's testimony should provide answers, accompanied by relevant data and information requested below, to the following specific questions: 1. What potential benefits does your new drug, Epogen, offer for Medicare beneficiaries? What health care costs might be reduced or eliminated for beneficiaries with specific ailments or disabilities, if they were to begin using Epogen as part of their treatment regimen? 2. Recent news reports (e.g., Washington Post, June 2, 1989, p.1) indicate that it costs approximately $140 to manufacture a typical patient's one year supply of your firm's new productEpogen, while the retail price of such a supply will range from$4,000 to $8,000 per year. Reports also note that your firmspent $100 million developing Epogen and that Medicare willannually incur $200-500 million insuring kidney dialysispatients who use the product. Please confirm or correct this information in your testimony. 3. In the course of its clinical testing, was Epogen tested in a substantial number of elderly subjects? What specialconsiderations pertaining to the elderly user, if any, werefound to be appropriate in the course of these trials? Does Epogen's product labeling contain a special section advising the physician on use in the elderly population? 4. What is the amount of money spent by your firm on prescriptiondrug research and development in each year from 1981 through1988? 5. For each year from 1981 through 1988, what is the amount of tax savings received by your firm for prescription drug research and development pursuant to Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code, pertaining to qualified research expenses?372 6. Has your firm sold its prescription drug products to foreign or U.S. government agencies which involve price discounts below the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) published in the U.S. at the time of sale? Which foreign and U.S. government agencies have been involved in such sales, and what have been the specific discounts (expressed as a percentage of the AWP) involved in each such sale during calendar years 1988 and 1989? 7. Has your firm entered into agreements to sell its prescription drug products to domestic or foreign third party payors (other than government agencies) involving price discounts below the AWP published in the U.S. at the time of sale? If so, what was the range of discounts (expressed as a percentage of the AWP) agreed to pursuant to such agreements during the calendar years 1988 and 1989? (Your firm will not be asked to publicly name other parties to these agreements.) 8. Has your firm sold its prescription drug products to foreign or domestic health care providers, including buying groups representing providers, at price discounts below the AWP published in the U.S. at the time of sale? If so, please furnish a description of the type(s) of providers or groups which have purchased prescription drug products from your firm at a discount below the published U.S. AWP, as well as the range of discounts (expressed as a percentage of the AWP) associated with such sales to each identified type of provider or group during calendar years 1988 and 1989. (Your firm will not be asked to publicly name other parties to such sales.) In addition, please provide copies of all materials concerning identification and price data of patented medicines, if any, that were submitted by your firm to the Canadian Patented Medicines Review Board in 1988 and 1989 pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 of the Regulations promulgated under Section 4(l)(i) of the Canadian Patent Act. Please be certain that these materials, if any, include (a) your firm's price lists for the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada, and (b) data regarding actual transactions in Canada. It would be greatly appreciated if these materials, previously compiled for and submitted to the Canadian government, are delivered to the Committee office no later than close of business on June 12, 1989. The Committee's hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. in room SD-562 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. I would very much appreciate your providing the Committee with ten copies of your-written testimony by close of business on June 19, and an additional 100 copies on the morning of June 21, 1989. Your testimony for submission into the record may be of whatever length you deem appropriate. The Committee would, however, appreciate your limiting oral remarks to no more than five minutes. Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in this inquiry by the Committee. Should you have questions relating to this invitation and request for information, please-have your staff contact David Schulke of the Special Committee on Aging staff at 202-224-5364. Sincerely DavidaPryor Chairman DP:dgs373 0 Ad a-ma smUnited States 1989 Mr. Gerald J. Mossin~ghoff President Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association 1100 Fifteenth Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20005 Dear Mr. Mossinghoff: Thank you for your letters of May 25 and June 5, 1989, inwhich you requested an opportunity for the PharmaceuticalManufacturers' Association (PMA) to present testimony to theSpecial Committee on Aging regarding prescription drug pricingpolicies of drug manufacturers. We appreciate your willingnessto assist the Committee in its inquiry, and would like to thankthe Association for the cooperation its staff has alreadyextended. We have thought carefully about your request to present oraltestimony at the Committee's hearing. As Members of theCommittees on Aging, Finance, and Governmental Affairs, we haveoften appreciated the value of association testimony on behalfof an industry affected by governmental policy. Associationtestimony is particularly effective in conveying points ofagreement between and among the varied interests and factionsthat inevitably exist in any industry. The Special Committee onAging, however, has a special role in that our investigativehearings are designed to develop and establish facts based onoriginal sources and evidence. For this Committee, identifyingthe priorities and common concerns hammered out within aparticular industry or trade group -- of critical importance toauthorizing committees' allocation of resources through thebudgetary process -- is secondary to our fact-finding function.In evaluating your request, therefore, we viewed the followingconsiderations as being of paramount importance. Pricing strategies are not determined on an industry-widebasis but are highly specific to individual firms. Indeed,firms' strategies are frequently quite divergent. Accordingly,the Committee has requested data directly from manufacturers,and has called this hearing so Members can ask relevantquestions of those responsible for determining company policiesand procedures pertaining to pricing of prescription drugcompounds.374 -Mr. Gerald J. Mossinghoff June 14, 1989 Page 2 The Association, in contrast with its member firms, lacks specific knowledge of firms' pricing policies, or the reas ns behind these decisions, and is prohibited by anti-trust statutes from participating in price-setting. Inasmuch as the Association is neither responsible nor accountable for manufacturers' decisions with respect to pricing of prescription drugs, we believe the Committee's limited hearing time will be most fruitfully employed in.frank -dialogue with company decision-makers, based on actual pricing data. We are mindful that several firms.have expressed their desire for the Association to be represented at the hearing. With the aim of providing invited firms every incentive to -participate-in this hearing, we are..prepared to accept PMA's oral testimony. We are not prepared, however, to accept PMA's -testimony in lieu of the participation of the invited manufacturers themselves. Accordingly, we would appreciate the 'Association making every effort to encourage its members to cooperate fully with the Committee,.both by providing requested data and by testifying before the Committee. Your oral'remarks will be limited to no more than five minutes, but the Association's written statement may be of whatever length you deem appropriate. If 150 copies of written testimony are received in the Committee office by June 19, it will be distributed in the Committee's press.packets on the day of the hearing. Thank you.for your interest in the Committee's examination of prescription drug manufacturer,.pricing practices. We hope that we can count on your continued assistance, particularly in encouraging member -firms-to cooperate fully with the Committee in its inquiry.

As Committee staff indicated to the PharmaceuticalManufacturers Association yesterday, in recognition of thesefirms' scheduling difficulties I have elected to reschedule thehearing to mid-July 1989. Shortly you will receive aninvitation for a new hearing date that I hope executives willfind more convenient. I also have received from several firms the suggestion thatthe Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association (PMA) be invitedto testify at the Committee's hearing. My view has been thatbecause the PMA is legally prohibited from becoming involved inits members' price setting decisions, the Association can offerlittle specific factual information to the Committee. However,in the interest of providing invited firms every incentive tocooperate with the Committee's inquiry, Senator Heinz and I havesent PMA the enclosed letter of invitation. Please note that wedo not view the Association's testimony as in any way replacingor lessening the need for manufacturers' participation in thehearing. In addition, several firms' representatives have stated theyare reluctant to participate because questions may be asked thatwould elicit confidential information. Please be advised thatmany of the questions Members may ask at the hearing will not bedesigned to elicit responses based on trade secrets or otherconfidential information. It is my hope and expectation thatinvited firms will decide to attend in order to assist theCommittee by answering as many questions as possible. I have instructed Committee staff to record each invitedfirm's final answer regarding requested data and testimony by nolater than close of business June 30, 1989.

This letter will confirm the Committee's interest in receiving oral and written testimony from you on the morning of the 18th, as discussed previously in conversations between Committee staff and Mr. Alquest, Commissioner of Income Maintenance and Medical Services. This hearing will examine factors contributing to prescription drug cost increases in recent years, and explore opportunities in the current marketplace for third party payors, service providers and others to negotiate prescription drug purchase prices with manufacturers. Examples of negotiated prices of interest to the Committee include price discounts afforded by manufacturers to government agencies, such as your Medicaid program, the federal government's Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defense, and to health care providers and buying groups, including hospitals,Health Maintenance Organizations, and retail pharmacies. Committee Members would appreciate hearing your views on a number of issues related to prescription drug pricing, based upon your experience in managing the Kansas State Medical Assistance program's prescription drug procurements for many years. It will be most helpful if your testimony addresses the followingquestions: 1. What is the Kansas Medicaid Pharmaceutical Bidding Program?Why did your State undertake such a program? 2. In general, what is the magnitude of discounts realized by the Kansas Medicaid Pharmaceutical Bidding Program (both whenexpressed as a percentage of the published Average Wholesale Price at the time of purchase and as total estimated dollar savings) as a result of its negotiations with manufacturers for procurement of .(a) multiple source and 4b). single source . prescription drugs?378 June 27, 1989 Page 2 3. What problems has the State encountered in. attempting to negotiate prices with manufacturers? How successful has the State been in its efforts to resolve.these problems? 4. What are the relative advantages of the Pharmaceutical Bidding Program as a means of containing-prescription drug costs, compared to (a) reduced reimbursement to pharmacists, (b) limitations on the extent of coverage, such as a.mazimum number of.prescriptions reimburseable per month or exclusion of new brand name products from coverage?

The Committee would like toknow the extent of price competition which may be associated withdrug patent expiration, and whether competition has had the effectof moderating price increases in brand products once they losepatent protection. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for yourwillingness to employ Medi-Span's unique historical database toidentify prescription drug price trends, and to specify the data ofgreatest utility to the Committee.

In summarizing your findings in testimony, it will be mosthelpful to the Committee if you will address these questions: 1. Is there a point in an innovator product's 'lifespan\" as it nears patent expiration when its manufacturer appears to reevaluateand significantly revise the product's pricing? If and when this takes place, in what way does the typical product's pricing change? 2. How often is the expiration of an innovator product's patentassociated with either a decline or a slowed rate of increase in the innovator product's published 'Average Wholesale Price'? 3. How often is the entry into the marketplace of one or more competing generic products associated with either a decline or a slowed rate of increase in the innovator product' s published ,Average Wholesale Price\"? 4. Based upon this study of brand prescription drugs facing generic competition, what conclusions do you reach regarding the marketplace 'price sensitivity, of manufacturers' published 'Average Wholesale Prices'?

Gibbons387 and BRIGITTE DUFFYOFFICE OF TECHNOLOGYVASSESMENT, U.S CONGRESSFOR THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITEE ON AGING Drug Price Inflation and Cost Containment July IS, 1989 In response to the Committe's request, we are submitting background information on recent trends in prescription drug pending and prices and a discussion of prospects for controlling expenditures for prescription drugs. The information that follows is based upon research we conducted in 1988 for an international conference on health care cost containment and not on any specific OTA'mrojet.- A-cepy- othat-pepep4 appended.tothis testimony for the record. OTA has recently begun two studies related to the subject of this hearing. One will ass alternative methods for paying for prescription drugs under Medicare and the other will study trends in pharmaceutical R&D costs and returns. The testimony presented here is unrelated to either of these projects. In 1987, $34 billion was spent in the United States for outpatient prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies;' that is about g percent of this country's total spending for personal health care services. Seventy-three percent of that spending, or S25 billion, was for prescription drugs. Since 1980, national spending on drugs and sundries has increased at a slightly lower rate than personal health care expenditures as a whole (wee chart 1). Between 1980 and 1987, spending on drugs and medical sundries rose by 81 percent, while personal health care spending rose by 101 percent Since 1983, however, national spending for drugs and sundries rose at a rate very close to the increase in total personal health care spending--about 8.5 percent per year. Despite the similarity in overall spending trends, the sources of the spending increases for drugs are very different from those for other components of health care. Virtually all of the increase in drug spending from 1980 to 1987 can be accounted for by increases in the prices that consumers must pay for thes items.5Unlike other components of health spending, utilization factors such as increasing volume or a more expensive mix of drugs played a minuscule role in driving up drug spending. Chart 2 compares the sources of spending increases -I-388 in drugs and sundries with those for total personal health care services and physician services. Forty-one percent of the increase in spending for physician services over the period is attributable to changes in utilization factors. whereas only 3 percent of spending on drugs and sundries is due to these factors. Price inflation is the key to drug spending increases in the 1980s. What is behind the increase in drug prices? Chart 3 compares changes in prescription drug prices with the consumer price index for non-medical goods and services. Prescription drug prices rose much more rapidly than general price inflation in the- 1980s. The purchasing power of a dollar for prescription drugs dropped by 48-percent-between 1980 and 1987. compared to a 26 percent decline in the purchasing power of a dollar for non-medical items. We estimate that almost 60 percent of the increase in spending for drugs and sundries between 1980 and 1987 was due to increases in drug prices in excess of general price inflation. To summarize the lessons from these trends, spending on drugs in the 1980s has generally tracked with overall inflation in health expenditures. With the Federal government about to take on new commitments for prescription drugs under the Medicare catastrophic health benefit, this component of health care expenditures will become increasingly important as la public policy issue. The data from the 1980s suggest that rising prices are the main drivers of increases in spending for prescription drugs; the success of efforts to contain expenditures for prescription drugs will depend in large measure on the ability to moderate the rate of prescription drug price inflation. How can prescription drug prices be controlled? Two general approaches are available: making the market for prescription drugs more price competitive and imposition of direct payment limits by third-party payers. Generic substitution, and the price competition it encourages for drugs available from more than one company, is a powerful vehicle for moderating increases in drug prices. In 1980. almost 70 percent of all prescriptions were written for drugs available from multiple sources.S and the proportion is expected to increase further by 1990 when more drugs lose their market exclusivity. The new Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit incorporates many features that -2-389 stimulate price competition for multiple source drugs. For example, after the deductible has been reached, Medicare's payment level is set.at the median average wholesale price' unless the physician specifically writes on the prescription that 'brand is medically necessary. This requirement for explicit physician override of generic substitution is, in our view, the strongest stimulus to generic substitution in the law. The law could have encouraged generic prescribing and dispensing even further by capping expenses that count toward the deductible at the median wholesale price of each multiple-source drug product. Doing so would have made Medicare recipients aware of the difference between the price they actually pay and the price at which the prescription could have been filled had they searched out low cost pharmacies and generic dispensing. Despite the potential for more price competition with multiple-source drugs, the prices of the remaining 20 to 30 percent of prescriptions--those for drugs available from only one firm--are largely uncontrolled. The development of new 'blockbuster drugs in future years could raise prescription drug expenditures dramatically. There is little experience to draw on for successful models of cost control for these products. Most of the alternatives for controlling prices of these drugs, such as restrictive formularies or direct price setting, have both strengths and limitations. One promising approach may be to build into physicians' ordering practices, through changes in the organization and financing of health care, a sensitivity to the cost of one therapy versus another. Thus, the future course of prescription drug expenditures could be as closely tied to broad changes in the health care system as it is to specific strategies for drug price control. I S.W.

Health Care Financing Ad-ministration in the preparation of this report394 INTRODUCTION This is an opportune time for a discussion of ways to contain the costs of prescription drugs in the United States and other countries. The U.S. government has just embarked on a major expansion of insurance coverage for prescription drugs for the 33 million Americans cov- ered by the Federal Medicare program (the health insurance program for the elderly and dis- abled). The implementation of that new Medicare catastrophic prescription drug benefit may have a big impact on the ways that drugs are marketed, priced, prescribed and dispensed in the United States. Legislators and program administrators.are understandably concerned about the effect the benefit will have on national expenditures and Medicare outlays for prescription drugs. The future path of US. prescription drug expenditures may be already largely charted by the cost-control measures that have been adopted by State legislatures regarding prescription drug prescribing and dispensing practices, by Federal and State administrators of the Medicaid program (the health insurance program for the poor), and by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 19S4. The Medicare catastrophic drug coverage provisions will be implemented in the context of these other measures, enhancing some and counteracting the effects of others. This paper describes and summarizes the evidence on the impact of the main approaches to cost containment aimed specifically at prescription drugs and examines how they are likely to act together in the future. More general cost-containment measures, such as adoption of pros- pective payment for hospitals or the development of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other at-risk health plans as an alternative to fee-for-service medicine, may in the long-run have important implications for prescription drug expenditures, but they are not discussed here. I395 The paper begins with a review of recent trends in spending for prescription drugs in the United States. These trends explain why cost-control efforts targeted specifically toward drugs have not been a main priority of health policy makers. Spending for prescription drugs has actually declined as a proportion of total health care spending since 1980. Whether that trend will continue, however, depends on a number of factors, including the quantity and therapeutic importance of future drug innovations and the speed with which cost-control measures are implemented in the future. The secondvpart of th\" paperfocuses-on t-entro -itselfrdescribing the major cost control mechanisms adopted to date. The paper concludes with observations about how these approaches can be expected to change prescription drug expenditures in the future. TRENDS IN PRESCRIPTON DRUG SPENDING National Expenditures for Prescription Drugs 1986 There is no single estimate of total US. spending on prescription drugs. The National Health Expenditures Series, maintained by the Office of the Actuary at the Health Care Financ- ing Admini tration (HCFA), tracks the value of expenditures for drugs and medical sundries.' The estimate for 1986 is $30.6 billion, which is approximately 7.6 percent of total personal health care expenditures (HCFA, 1987). This estimate is inaccurate for several reasons. First, the category includes over-the- counter (OTC) drugs and related items as well as prescription drugs. Second, it excludes all ex- penditures for patients who are hospitalized and some expenditures for patients in nursing homes.' In 1981, approximately 20 percent of drug purchases by pharmacies were made by non-Federal hospital pharmacies (IMS America, 1981). Third, it excludes purchases of drugs from retail establishments that are not primarily pharmacies and mail-order suppliers. Fourth, I Expenditures for drugs dispensed by a hospital or nursing home and included in the institu-tion's bill to the patient would be shown as a hospital or nursing home service. 2396 it excludes prescriptions dispensed directly by Health Maintenance Organizations (i.e., not filled at community pharmacies). In 1987, approximately 12 percent of all Americans were enrolled in HMOs (Interstudy, Inc., 1987). but the extent of direct dispensing by these organizations is unknown. HCFA is currently in the process of reestimating the National Health Expenditure Series back to 1960, and analysts predict that the largest adjustments will be in the 'drugs and medical sundries' category (Waldo, 1988). After taking account of mail-order purchases and purchases in retail establishments that are not pharmacies (e.g., supermarkets with a pharmacy), HCFA ac- tuaries expect 1986 spending in the category to be adjusted upward by roughly 10 percent (Waldo, 1988). After the adjustments are made, about two-thirds of these expenditures will be for prescription drugs; the rest will be for OTC drugs and related items (Waldo, 1988). Taking into account all of these adjustments, we estimate that expenditures for prescrip- tion drugs in the US. in 1986 are approximately S26.7 billion, or about 6.5 percent of personal health care expenditures in the United States. This still modestly underestimates total drug ex- penditures, for it does not include expenditures by Federal hospitals' and unbilled expenditures for nursing homes and HMOsC' Trends in Snendint: 1980-1986 Chart I shows the trends in spending for drugs and sundries bought in pharmacies and for total personal health care services since 1980. Between 1980 and 1986 spending on drugs and medical sundries (as currently estimated by HCFA) increased by 66 percent in current dol- 2 These consist mainly of the 172 Veterans Administration Hospitals. 3 The total estimated value of manufacturer shipments (net of foreign trade) of pharmaceutical preparations for human use in 1986 was S24 billion (US. Department of Commerce, 1987). This estimate does not include biologicals such as vaccines or transportation and distribution costs, which should be included in the expenditure calculation. Nevertheless, this estimate is roughly in line with those from the National Health Expenditures series. 3397 tars, compared to an 83 percent increase in personal health care spending. The percentage of personal health care expenditures accounted for by drugs and sundries dropped from 9 in 1980 to 7.8 percent in 1986. This ddine is in part an artifact of the inadequate estimate of pres- cription drugs described above, since purchases outside of community-based pharmacies in- creased during the period and may account for as much as 10 percent of all drugs and sundries purchases today. Even if we were to assume that the entire extra 10 percent reflects new pur- chases since 1980, the total percentage increase in spending on drugs would be about 80 percent in the period, still a bit less than the overall increase in health care spending. Of course, price inflation plays a major role in increasing expenditures for health care (Feder et aL, 1987). Since 1980, the medical care component of the consumer price index (CPI) has been increasing much more rapidly than has the CPI for other goods and services, and prescription drug prices have increased faster than general medical care prices in that period. (See Table 1.) Chart 2 shows changes in spending for drugs and sundries after accounting for price changes.4In constant dollars, spending for drugs and sundries has remained virtually flat over the period. Roughly 50 percent of the increase in pending for drugs and sundries can be attributed to the general increase in the CPI; the remainder is largely due to the excess increase in drug prices over general price inflation. Only 3 percent is due to increases in the volume of drug purchases or in the complexity of the mix of drugs dispensed. 4 The currently available HCFA estimates of spending for drugs and sundries was converted to constant dollars based on the assumption that 63 percent of drugs and sundries expenditures reported in HCFA's current National Health Expenditures Series were for prescription drugs; the rest were assumed to be for OTC drugs and medical sundries. This esimate of the prescrip- tion drug share is consistent with information on expected changes in the expenditure estimates provided by HCFA analysts (D. Waldo, 1988). The prescription drug share was deflated by the prescription drug component of the Consumer Price Index for urban areas (CPI-U); the other component was deflated by the non-medical component of the CPI-U. 4Annual Change In U.S. Personal Health Care Expenditures Current.

General consumer prices rose by approximately 176 per- cent during the period. The number of prescriptions per enrollee increased by only 16 percent over the eight years. Thus, if the elderly are any guide, over the longer period, since 1977, the major part of the increase in spending on drugs could be explained by general inflation.' Sources of Funds for Drue Expenditures: 1986 According to data published.for. 1996, about .75 percent ~aaU, drugs and medical sundries are paid for directly by the consumer without the help of insurers or government sub- sidies (HCFA, 1987). Even taking into account expected changes in estimates of total expenses in this category, it appears that the consumer was directly responsible for about 73 percent of total expenditures for drugs and medical sundries and 60 percent of expenditures for prescrip- tion drugs. (See Table 2.) The share of third parties has grown steadily since 1980 as private insurance plans, lHMOs, and State governments have added prescription drugs as benefits. The anticipated enactment of the Medicare Catastrophic Care Act of 1988 will, of course, further change the distribution of payment sources. Implications for Cost Control Despite the imprecision in the estimates of spending on prescription drugs in the United States, three conclusions are obvious o drugs and medical sundries account for a small proportion of total personal health care expenditures --between 6 and 7 percent; prescription drugs ac- count for only about 4 percent of personal health care expenditures. o spending for drugs and sundries is increasing more slowly than total spending for personal health care services; 5 Many clinicians would find a 16 percent increase over 8 years in the number of prescriptions per elderly Medicare beneficiary alarming for its potential implications for the quality of patient care. The point here is that, from the standpoint of health expenditures, a 2 percent per year increase in prescription drug use in the absense of price increases would look quite small com- pared to increases in other categories. 5402 Table 2.--Source of Funds for Expenditures on Drugs and Sundries United States, 1986 Total drugs Prescription Other Source and sundries drugs items All sources 1OOO. 100.0l 60.21 Government 11.01. - 16.51 0.0 SOURCE: Calculated from HCFA, 1987 data, adjusting for anticipated changes in spending estimates.

It is not surprising, then, that cost control for prescription drugs has been a lower priority in the US. than has control of expenditures in other segments of the health care system. However, focussing only on general trends can mask serious problems of cost control, and policy makers have been actively. addressing-4h. problano fsin&,drug pric-The chief question has been whether prescription prices are rising for reasons that reflect changes in the costs of re- search and development (R&D), production and distribution, or whether the increases in drug prices are a reflection of monopoly power in the pharmaceutical industry (US. Congress, House of Representatives, 1987; Comanor, 1986). Because the consumer must pay for a large portion of prescription drug costs out-of-pocket, third party payers have taken only limited steps to control expenditures. Nevertheless, with the increasing coverage of prescription drugs by third- party payers, other approaches to cost control are now gaining widespread interest. m11 STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THE COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Cost control strategies for prescription drugs fall into two distinct but interdependent categories. One category comprises policies intended to make the market for drugs more price competitive. These general market competition policies arose from assessments of barriers to price competition in wholesale and retail drug markets. They represent efforts to eliminate or reduce barriers that insufficiently contribute to conflicting national objectives such as consumer protection and product innovation. The second kind of cost control consists of strategies undertaken by public and private third party payers as part of their more general attempts to control program expenditures. Third party payer cost-control strategies fall into four sub-categories 6404 o raising beneficiary cost-sharing (e.g., increased deductibles, copayments); o controlling the price paid by the third-party payer for a service or item; o directly controlling the utilization of services or products; and o bundling or packaging groups of services together for payment purposes. The two kinds of cost control -- general enhancement of price competition and third- party payer strategies -- are interdependent, because actions taken in one area can alter the ef- fectiveness of strategies in another. The ultimate in beneficiary cost sharing. for example, is the exclusion of prescription drugs as a benefit altogether. Such a policy would make con- sumers more price sensitive and- would probably increase the potential-effectiveness of strategies designed to reduce consumers' cost of search for retail price information. (It also puts the bur- den of expenditure for prescription drugs wholly on the patient.) For purposes of discussion, we will describe the approach to each kind of cost-containment strategy separately, emphasizing the important linkages among the-approaches as appropriate. Strateaies Designed to Enhance Price Comoetition in the US. Market for Prescription DrUEs Federal and State efforts to enhance price competition in the wholesale and retail drug markets evolved from the realization that prescription drug prices were higher than they needed to be to assure both an adequate level of public safety and an adequate level of product innova- tion in the pharmaceutical industry. These artificially high prices were thought to arise from barriers to price competition, some of which-are inherent in the structure of the industry and others which ensue from Federal and State health and safety regulations. Reform of such regulations has been the cornerstone of policies geared toward making the prescription drug market more price competitive. Recently, doubts have been raised about whether the reforms to date have been sufficiently effective in stimulating price competition (US. Congress. April 21, 1987) and whether the benefits of the price competition that does exist are passed on to the consumer by the pharmacist (Bloom et al., 1988). 7405 Several features of the prescription drug market potentially give firms power to charge higher prices than would be sustainable in a competitive marketL First, patent protection, though available to all industries, is extremely imposunt to the pharmaceutical industry (Com- anor. 1986). Patent protection is a policy intended to stimulate innocation by conferring monopoly power to the developer of a new product or process for a limited tme. During the period of protection for a specific drug product, the patent bolder may choose to be the single source of supply for that product Patent protection is limited to the specific product and therefore does not fully protect the from rOrcenompetitionWitbother drug products with similar therapeutic effects (Dao, 1984). but in general, the greater the real or perceived therapeutic benefits of a new drug over preexisting alternatives, the more effective is the patent in protecting the firm's market power. Second, the introduction of new drug products is subject to rigorous regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which requires extensive animal and human testing be- fore a new chemical entity is approved for marketing These requirements substantially add to the costs of development and delaythe introduction of new drugs. The ultimate impact of FDA regulation of new drug development on the rate and quality of innovation has been the subject of vigorous debate (Comanor, 1986). but it is safe to say that when the potenta market for a new drug is not large enough to justify the costs of meeting regulatory requirements, its intro- duction will be inhibited. Until 1984, FDA subjected all applications for marketing to the same evidentiary standards regardless of whether they were for a new chemical entity or for a new maker of a drug product whose patent has expired. Because manufacturers of 'generic equi- 6 For a review of the literature on the economics of the pharm ceutical industry, see Comanor,1986. a406 valents' of brand-name drugs that had lost patent protection had to invest substantial resources in clinical testing with the promise of capturing a small share of the maarket, many opportunities were foregone for increased price competition after patent expiration. Third. and perhaps most important, virtually all prescriptions are written by physicians on behalf of consumers who are in large measure ignorant of generic or therapeutic alternatives. The prescription is an order for a specific drug entity, either by its chemical name (ie., gener- ic) or brand name. When a drug entity is manufactured by only one firm, the distindtion be- tween generic or brand-name prescribing -is-trivial; but lhe a specific drug-entity is available from multiple sources, the physician has the therapeutic prerogative to insist that a specific brand be dispensed. Even when the physician holds no strong therapeutic rationale for pres- cribing the brand name, he or she may still write a prescription using the brand name out of habit or brand loyalty (Statman, 1981; Bond and LeAn, 1977). In 1980, 79 percent of all prs- criptions written for multi-source drugs in the United States were written for a brand (Masson and Steiner, 1985). Procedures governing prescription dispensing determine how prescriptions for multi- source drugs are filled. State laws and traditional pharmacist practices have influenced these dispensing conventions. Because generic drugs are generally less expensive than their brand- name equivalents, policies to increase the frequency with which generics are either specified on the prescription or are substituted for brand-name prescriptions by the pharmacist offer the potential for saving hundreds of millions of dollars per year in expenditures for prescription drugs (Federal Trade Commission, 1979). The two major initiatives intended to increase drug price competition have both focused on encouraging the use of generic equivalents for drugs whose patent protection has expired. The first initiatives were implemented at the State level throughout the 1970s,. with the enact- ment of State laws repealing restrictions on the freedom of the pharmacist to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name prescriptions. The second was a 1984 Federal law, the Drug Price407 Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 98-417), which permitted FDA to expedite the approval process for generic versions of brand-name drugs already found to be safe and effective by the FDA. Each is discussed below. State-Level Generic Substitution Laws -Before 1970, most States had laws restricting the pharmacist's ability to substitute a lower-cost generic drug for a brand-name drug when the brand name was specified on the prescription form. By 1980, all 50 States had enacted drug product selection laws either requiring or permitting pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for the prescribed brand name.drugsa-long-as-it.wnotexprealy prohibited by the ordering physician. Despite the full diffusion of these laws throughout the States, generic substitution achieved only a toe-hold in dispensing practices. By 1984. only about 4 to 5 percent of all prescriptions written for a brand were subject to generic substitution (Masson and Steiner, 1985; Carroll et al., 1987). Masson and Steiner (1985) estimated that by 1984 consumer expenditures were reduced by about 5130 to S240 million as a result of generic substitution. The specific attributes of generic substitution laws have varied, however, and two recent studies have shown that some of these features have a major effect on substitution rates (Masson and Steiner, 1985; Carroll et al.. 1987). Table 3 summarizes the findings of the two studies with respect to particular features of State law. Both studies support the conclusion that generic sub- stitution laws are more effective when all three participants in the transaction -- the patient, the physician and the pharmacist -- are given incentives and information that encourages sub- stitution. Patients appear to encourage substitution when they are informed of the alternatives, as the positive effects of the age of the law and requirements for patient consent demonstrate. Substitution is impeded if the pharmacist is required to pass on all savings from substitution to the consumer. Finally, the format of the prescription pad, and the inconvenience the physician is put through in order to insist on brand name dispensing, was found in both studies to be a strong predictor of the extent of generic substitution. 10408 Table 3.-- Results of Studies of State Generic Substitution Laws stua Variable on z U2 of lI Number of years the drug product selection law was in effect Patient consalnt: Pharmacist must receive patients' consent to substitute a generic drug Additional record keenins: If substituting generics, pharmacist must keep additional records Savingg transfer: pharmacist is required to pass savings on to the consumer Prescription fort: Two-lina prescription pads (requiring positive action on physicisn's part to specify a generic) Degree to which pa makes it easy or difficult to substitute: -RXPRO (easy) -RZANA1 (difficult) Fruary liaitatiMI: Lists of drugs that either may (positive formulary) or may not (negative formulary) -positive formulary substitution: Pharmacist must substitute lover-priced drugiasAlong as the prescriber has not prohibited substitution Pharmacist hassle factor: Index of the extent to which the pharmacist must inform other parties involved, obtain consent of the consumer, and keep detailed recordsdy tdirection Differences in State Drug Product Selection Laws on Pharmacists' Substitution Behavior,' Medical fare 25(11):1069-1077, 1987. 2 -A.

One problem stemmed from' the erosion of effective patent terms due to the delay in new drug approval after a firm had received a patent Brand-name producers argued that the delay effectively reduced their returns fron innovation in new drugs and therefore reduced research and development outlays and rates of innovation (US. Congress, 1983). On the other hand, the costly requirements for clinical testing for market approval of any new drug, including generic equivalents, appeared to impede the introduction of-generics to-the market-end-tolgive- te-brand-name. producers con- tinued market power even after patent terms had'expired. The 1984 law struck a compromise between the two problems by extending patent terms to cover the period of drug lag while aubstantially reducing the testing requirements for ap- proval of new generic drugs. Thus, while giving away more market power on the one hand, the law took away market power on the other. By the end of 1986, FDA had approved over 1,000 new generic drug products under the provisions of the new law, and generic prescribing has increased rapidly since that time, al- though the trends are influenced by other factors in addition to the 1984 law (Nightingale and Morrison. 1987). These early gains in competition will be paid for later as new patented drugs re approved for marketing with longer patent lives. It is unclear whether the gains are worth the costs, because the costs of the law will depend on the rate of new drug development in the coming year, the therapeutic importance of the new drugs, and the speed with which competi- ng therapeutic alternatives are developed to limit effective patent protection. Effects of Comnetdgo-based Cost Control -The purpose of both initiatives described above was to introduce more price competition in the market for prescription drugs. The in- creasing share that generic drugs have of the total prescription drug market suggests that such competition is working. However, recent evidence collected by the US. House of Representa- tives Subcommittee on Health and the Environment suggests that, contrary to expectations, the IIBrand Name Aldomet 250mg tab INC.

(See Table 4.) The reasons for these anomalous results are unclear, but several ex- planations are possible. The American Association of Retired Persons claims that drug companies are charging more because they discovered they can' (Guildroy, 1987). This would imply, of course, that before brand-name drug prices began their sharp ascent in 1980, the companies were ignorant of and failed to act on their substantial market power,. an unlikely scenario. Companies may have exercised pricing restraint for strategic reasons --to avoid calling public attention to their substantial market power. Since the pharmaceutical industry was among the most profitable, companies were not under pressure to maximize short run profits by raising prices. As the in- dustry came to grips with increasing competition from generics and loss of market share, drug companies may have changed tactics to emphasize product competition in market segments that would remain insensitive to price differentials. Second, pharmaceutical companies may have been more successful in maintaining physician brand loyalty than was anticipated by those who crafted the generic reforms. Some have claimed that the companies have waged a campaign to discredit the true therapeutic equi- valence of generic drugs7 (Guildroy, 1987; Hutton, 1987). Perhaps firms have learned that brand-name products are luxury goods whose perceived value to the consumer.or physician is a positive function of price. High price differentials between brand name drugs and their generic equivalents may call attention to the potential differences in product quality that major pharmaceutical companies wish to emphasize. 7 The Food and Drug Administration has made efforts to reassure the medical community about the safety of generic prescribing by clarifying its procedures governing the introduction and production of generic products (Nightengale and Morrison, 1987). 12413 Another possibility is that the increase in private insurance coverage of prescription drugs in recent years may have reduced the cross-price elasticity of demand, thus enabling brand name manufacturers to increase prices. That such a trend could account for all of the price increase is unlikely, however. The drug companies claim that prices are increasing because costs, particularly research and development costs, are increasing (Watson, 1987), but this would not make sense for pro- ducts facing vigorous price competition from generics if by raising prices firms stood to lose substantial market share. - The wholesale drug prices listed in Table 4 do not reflect the manufacturers' total market. The prices shown reflect wholesale prices to a large community-based chain of pharmacies. The market for prescription drup may be increasingly segmented, allowing sup- pierss to charge more competitive prices to volume purchased such as hospitals, HMOs, or mail- order suppliers while raising prices to the segment with the lowest price elasticity of demand. But this is simply conjecture, data on actual prices to various customers has not been compiled to date. If this is indeed the case, we must ask why the community pharmacy segment of the market would be so price inelastic when consumers purchasing in this setting probably pay for a high proportion of drug costs out-of-pocket. Only insufficient knowledge of the alternatives and inadequate incentives to the pharmacist to inform consumers about the options would ex- plain how the market could become segmented in this way. Third-Party Paver Drug Cost Containment Proerams Third-party payers (public and private health insurers consisting mainly of Medicare, Medicaid and employer-sponsored group health plan) have substantially increased prescription drug benefits in recent years. Medicaid, the Federally-aided State-administered health plan for the poor, includes drugs as an optional benefit. Al but three of the 51 Medicaid jurisdictions have a prescription drug plan. At present, Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs except for immunosuppressive drugs in the year after transplantation, but beginning in 13 31-352 0 -90 -14414 1991, a general catastrophic prescription drug benefit will be put into place. Despite the lack of coverage by Medicare, almostd t e-quarters of dl elderly people have private supplementary insurance ('Medigap') policies which sometimes iclude prescription drug benefits (Gordon, 1986; Rice and McCall, 1985). As of 1987, eight Stae provided financial uasance to ap- proximately 1.3 million eigibe low-ino elderly people for the purchase of prescription drugs through State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (US. Congress, OTA, 1987). More- over, at present about 3 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in capitated health care plans under a Medicare risk-sharing ugroement, ad many-of these plans-include prescription drugs as a benefit Private health insurance coverage of prescription drop has grown rapidly, from 12 per- cent of all outpatient prescription expee in 1977 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser- vices, 1982) to an estimated 23 percent in 1986. (See Table 2 above.) This growth in benefits has been accompanied by an increasing interest in controlling program expenditures, but to date few programs have been developed that are targeted specificaily at drugs.$ This section reviews the experience of public third-party payers with strategies aimed directly at controlling prescription drug tue or expenditures The experience of the State Medicaid programs'provides the richest source of iaformation, not only because Medicaid has offered a more generous drug benefit than other third-party payers, but also because the States provide a natural laboratory in which the effectiveness of alternative cost control strategies can be assessed. Many features of Medicare's new catastrophic drug benefit are based on that expe- rience. The review wiU therefore begin with a discussion of cost control under the Medicaid 8 Most private-sector drug coat-coatainment programs have focpssed on efficient claims pro- ceasing and mail-order drug dispensing. Recently, pharmcy organizations and private firms have marketed capitated drug benefits to group health plans (Ptuicelli, 1988). These at-risk drug benefit plans have an incentive to purchase and dispense drugs at the lowest possible price and to review and control utilization as much as possible. Thes specialty preferred-provider organizations are rel- atively new, with a small market to date, but their importance is growing. 14415 drug reimbursement programs. Then, we describe the outpatient prescription drug provisions of the recently enacted Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 and review its principal cost-control features. Medic id Dru Remr m mt Proaus Although prescription drugs are an optional benefit under Medicaid, 48 of the 51 Medicaid jurisdictions in the United States currently have such a program. The specific designs , of the programs differ, reflecting different approaches to expenditure control Table 5 sum- marizes the main cost-control provisions in .placea.4 1987. Cost.control strategies used by State Medicaid programs have included the following o Reaniremend t for ents by enrollees -Twenty States require the enrollee to pay a part of the drug charge, but in half of the States with this provision the copayment is quite low. Federal law prohibits the States from requiring children or pregnant women to share in the cost of Medicaid services, in- cluding drugs o Bill f=Wuiz -Thee are lists of drugs that are approved for pay- ment by Medicaid. Claims for prescription drugs that are not on the for- mulary are denied payment by the State Medicaid program. About 20 states had restricted formularies in 1987. o Maximumn ayment lmia for al drues disnensed -Virtually all States pay a fixed dispensing fee and an amount to cover the ingredient costs. The median dispensing fee in 1987 was 53.50. Payments for the cost of in- gredients were typically limited to the average wholesale price of the drug, with a few przgrams having limits somewhat less than the average wholesale price (National Pharmaceutical Council, 1987). o Seiel limit caled Maximum Allowable Costs (MAC) on payments for multi-source drusm with at least 3 suppliers -The Federal Medicaid program issued regulations for a universal MAC program in 1976, which by 1983 in- cluded price imits on 57 separate drug entities9(Gagnon and Grabowski, 1983), but many States went further than required by the regulations in limiting reimbursement for other drugs that had generic equivalents. MAC programs set ingredient price limits based on a review of wholesale prices of all competing manufacturers of a given generic drug. An important feature of the MAC programs is the requirement that the prescriber certify in his or 159 In some cases these include different dosages of the same drug.416 Table 5 --Cost Containment Provisions of 48 Medicaid Drug Reimbursement Systems 1987 Cost containment Number of provision states Comments 48 Ran $2.60-$5.12 Abbreviation: MAC -maximm allowable charge. -SOURCE: National Pharmaceutical Council, September 1987.417 her own handwriting that a specific brand is medically necessary in order for the MAC price not to apply. This 'physician override' requirement pro- vides a powerful impetus to generic dispensing for Medicaid patients. The Federal MAC regulations were revised in 1987 to allow the States greater flexibility in implementing MAC program,, but the States must doc- ument that their expenditures for the drugs covered by Federal regulations do not in the aggregate exceed 150 percent of the least costly generic equi- valent that can be purchased by pharmacists in reasonable quantities (FederalRegister. July 31, 1987). o Diin R ib -Some States have established restrictions on the amount of a drug that can be dispensed at one time or on the number of prescriptions that can be reimbursed in any month. Limits on prescription size are intended to prevent hoarding or inappropriate drug sharing by en- roilees, -whereslimitsoa-the.totalnaumbeL of. prescriptions are intended todiscourage indiscriminate prescribing by physicians and drug use by Medicaid recipients. o Pharmacy Caoition Programs -For 8 months in 1981, the State of Iowa ex- perimented with a program which paid pharmacists prospectively for the ex- pected drug expenditures based on the types of Medicaid eligibles who chose them as their providers (Yesatis, et aL, 1984). Pharmacists stood to gainfiancially from active involvement in the drug utihization review aspects of their profession. The program was ended after 8 months, when it became evident that it was not having its intended effects (Yesalis et al., 1984). o Drug Utilization Review -Eleven States have adopted a sophisticated program for reviewing patient use of drugs for their medical appropriateness and therapeutic implications. Underlying the program is the assumption that in- appropriate prescribing is not only bad medicine, but it also has implicationsfor the use of expensive health care services such as hospitals or physicians. A proprietary therapeutic drug-use review program called DURbase identifies patients whose patterns of prescription drug use place them at risk of drug-induced illness (Health Information Designs, Inc.). Patient profiles built from claims data (including medical services and filled prescriptions) are monitored by computer on a monthly basis using therapeutic criteria to flag high-risk cases. Physicians and pharmacists review flagged profiles, and if a problem is stili unresolved, letters are sent to physicians alerting them to the potential for drug-induced ilness in their patients (Groves, 1985). Numerous studies have been conducted examining the effects of particular strategies on Medicaid drug expenditures. They all suffer fronmsresarch design flaws, so conclusions must be tentative. The MAC program was evaluated in two government-sponsored studies (HCFA, 1980; U.S. General Accounting Office, 1980), both of which concluded that the MAC program pro- duced major savings for the Medicaid program. However, Gagnon and Grabowski have criti- cized both studies (Gagnon and Grabowski, 1983). First, they may have been-based on un- 16418 representative samples of States and drug products. Second, the studies tend to underestimate the administrative costs of the program. Third, and most important, the studies did not ade- quately address the extent to which program savings to Medicaid were achieved at the expense of higher costs to other payers. Despite these criticisms, the impact of the MAC program on Medicaid drug expenditures has probably increased over time, and particularly after 1984, as more and more generic drugs came onto the market The use of copayment requirements has consistently reduced drug program expenditures (Smith, et al.; 19g2i Nelson, 1984, Sdmerai et al., I1977.M However, none of the studies of copayment examined the impact on overall use of Medicaid services or total program expendi- tures. Since copayment discourages consumers from filing prescriptions, negative impacts on health outcomes may also ensue. Possible effects in that area have not been examined. Findings on the impact of restrictive formularies on Medicaid drug program costs are equivocal, but in general this approach has not been found to yield substantial savings in drug program or total Medicaid costs (Hefner, 1979; Smith et al., 1982). These findings have also been criticized for inadequate research design (Rucker and Morse, 1981). Restrictive for- mularies do pose bureaucratic obstacles for the addition of new drugs and may delay the availability of new drugs to Medicaid recipients. Limiting the quantity dispensed at any one time has been found to save program ex- penditures (Smith et al., 1982), but restricting the number of prescriptions dispensed per time period, though cost-reducing in terms of Medicaid drug expenditures, may increase overall pro- gram expenditures and compromise the health status of the group that most frequently uses multiple prescriptions -- the elderly and disabled (Soumerai, 1987). Drug utilization review programs have not been adequately evaluated. An anecdotal report on the State of Florida's experience with the DURBase program suggests that it has been favorably received by physicians and has saved medical care associated with preventable drug-419 induced illness (Groves. 1985). Considering that almost 200 million Medicaid prescriptions are processed each year, the admini trative costs of drug utilization review, even with automated data processing and review systems, must be carefully considered. In summary, the experience from Medicaid is that program expenditures can be curtailed by prudent pricing policies and copayment, but each of these approaches has implications that have not been adequately studied. The cost-shifting potential of Medicaid price stringency has not been assessed; and the implications for quality of care of copayment provisions have not been adequately investigated.- - Catastrophic Outpatient Drut Coverage under Medicare The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-360) contains a new benefit under which Medicare beneficiaries with high annual expenditures for prescription drugs will receive some financial relief. The Catastrophic Coverage law represents a major departure for the Medicare program. because for the rfitm time premiums are partially linked to incomes. The catastrophic drug benefit will be fully financed from special premiums paid by the elderly. The drug coverage provisions are to be phased-in over a four-year period, with changes in the drugs covered. the deductibles required before the beneficiary is eligible for coverage, and the coinsurance rate. Table 6 contains a summary of the major features of the catastrophic drug coverage provision. The drug payment provisions of the bill are summarized in Table 7. The bill is similar to the payment structure under most Medicaid programs, except that the Medicare bill sets up a 'participating pharmacy' program which offers incentives to pharmacists to substitute generic 18Table 6. --DRUG COVERAGE PROVISIONS: The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 Year Drug Classes Covered Deductible\"\"\"(2) Coinsurance Other Restrictions cy 1990 a) Home Intravenous IV Therapy $550 a) 20X b) Imunosuppresaive drugs b) 50O beyond first year post- transplantation cy 1991 All Prescription Drugs $600 50 --Medicare will pay its full share (1001 minus cy 1992 Same as Above $652 401 coinsurance) of the cost of th. drug up to the payment limit; (See Table 7 for calculation o payment limit) cy 1993, etc. Sase as Above Index based on 16.86 202 --dispensed quantity may be no of Medicare beneficiaries more than 30 days supply exceeding deductible unless authorized by DHHS limit Notes: I Expenses counting toward deductible based on actual expenses, not limited to payment limit amounts; Deductible waived for home IV drug therapy initiated during hospital stay and for fimunosuppressive drugs in first year aftei transplantation. Abbreviation: cy -calender year.0421 drugs for brand-anme drugs in exchange for a higher dispensing fee.10In addition, the Medicare bill requires only two manufacturers to offer a given drug product with generic equi- valents for it to be considered a multiple source drug. Table 8 summariz the features of the bill that are intended to control program ex- penditures. Many of the cost-containment features in Medicaid that have been found to be most effective have been adopted by the Medicare program. Of particular importance is the adoption by Medicare of the Medicaid MAC provision requiring physicians to write that a brand is medically necessary for the- drug to be considered a-singlo-source product. The program is designed to be fiscally solvent, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will have the authority to control outlays by varying the deductible or keeping the coinsurance rate at 40 percent. The Department will also be able to change the method of cal- culating payment limits. Since Medicare will pay its share of the cost only up to the drug pay- ment limitS, changing the method of calculating payment Linits can increase effective coinsurance rates for beneficiaries, who might then have to pay the balance between the pay- ment limit and the actual charge. Since only non-participating pharmacists will be able to bill for the balance, reducing payment levels may discourage pharmacy participation in the program. No one knows, of course, how the Medicare drug provisions will affect the prices of drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and other consumers. It is possible that the payment limits will become payment floors instead of ceilings, thus giving windfall profits to pharmacists at the cost to both Medicare patients and the program. The fact that the vast majority (84 percent) of Medicare beneficiaries will not become eligible for any benefits under these provisions may protect against this outcome, but consumers may be inefficient at searching out low-cost retail drug outlets (Bloom et aL, 1986). 10 A participating pharmacist must accept the price Medicare sets as a limit for all drugs dispensed to a beneficiary after the deductible has been met. Since the payment limit for multi-source drugs is tobe calculated as the median price across all available sources, the pharmacist will have an incentive todispense the Ci O) _t to ise to dipm mY Hedieow bmetieissISee C.) _C\"C to imeelesias mess w me-aL P*Iu; Mp PotLi CONCLUSIONS Cost control strategies aimed specifically at prescription drugs have yet to demonstrate a significant impact on drug prices, at least as measured by published wholesale prices, but the structure to effect real changes in prescribing and dispensing practices in favor of lower cost drugs may be largely in place. Generic substitution laws, MAC-like third-party payment pro- grams, and requirements governing dispensing conventions have increased the rate of generic substitution, and the advent of Medicare catastrophic drug coverage will strengthen these incen- tives. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Law could have gone even further to encourage generic prescribing and dispensing had expenses counting toward the deductible been capped at the median wholesale price of each multi-source drug product. Medicare recipients would have been made aware of the difference in the price they actually pay and the price at which the prescription might be obtained by actively searching out low cost pharmacies and generic dis- pensing. The key to containment of prescription drug expenditures appears to rest with the physician. Physicians can be given positive incentives to prescribe generic drugs and to consid- er less expensive therapeutic alternatives to expensive drugs, but they can also be made to pay for their brand loyalty with inconvenient and time-consuming prescription format requirements. The 'physician override' requirement of the Medicaid MAC regulations and the Medicare Catastrophic benefits, if vigorously enforced, will further encourage moderation of drug ex- penditures.11 I I Enforcement of this requirement is important not only in its own right, but as a spur to Statelegislatures to revise the prescription pad formats so as to be in conformance with Medicaid andMedicare regulations. 20424 Table 8.--Drug Cost Control Provisions of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 Direct Controls: o Puts limits on payment levels for aUl drugs -average wholesale price for single source drugs -median of average wholesale price for multiple-source drugs. o Requires Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to establish program to identify pattrns of unnecessary or inappropriate prescribing; may deny coverage for *medically un- necessary' services. o Requires physician to specify that brand is *medically necessary' on prescription for drug to be considered *single source' product O Limits number of doses dispensed at one time to 30 days or less. o Gives DHHS authority in 1993 and 1994 to impose outlay controls (such as increasing de- ductible amount, halting reductdon in coisurance rate) to keep system solvent, except that it CANNOTI I) estsblish restrictive formulary, 2) change method for calculating expenses for deductible, or 3) increase coinsurance rate fromn preexisting rate.

O Requires DHHS study of methods of Drug Utilization Review.425 Although generic substitution is an important vehicle for moderating drug costs, it is not entirely sufficient. In 1980, 31 percent of all prescriptions were written for drugs available only from a single source (Masson and Steiner, 1985). It has also been estimated that by 1990, less than 20 of the top 100 prescribed drugs in the United States will have patent protection (Nomura Research, 1988). The prices of these single-source drugs -- those with current patent protection -- are largely unregulated.'2 When these drugs are perceived as therapeutically im- portant by physicians and patients, there may be very little price elasticity of demand. Expan- sions of drug benefits under private and publio-health-insurance-further.reduce the price elasticity of demand for these products. New 'blockbuster' drugs for prevalent diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, and AIDS could potentially raise the share of prescription drugs in health care expenditures. How will we control these expenditures in the future? By building into physicians' practices a sensitivity to the cost of one therapy versus another, the demand for single-source drugs can in some instances be made more price elastic. This paper has not discussed the im- plications for prescription drug expenditures of general trends in health care cost-containment, namely the introduction of capitated health care systems and other forms of payment bundling. Today, almost 13 percent of all Americans are enrolled in health maintenance organizations, and most of these plans include drugs in their benefit plans. To the extent that prescription drup- are included in the payment bundle, providers have the financial incentive to prescribe in a fashion that will reduce the total costs of the bundle and to prescribe the least expensive drug available. HMOs also use restrictive formularies, volume purchasing, and selective contracting with pharmacies to achieve savings in drug costs (Patricelli, 1988).

Pryor Chairman Senate Special Committee on Aging Room G-31 Dirksen Senate Office Building US Senate Washington, D.C. 20510-6400 Dear Senator Pryor: On behalf of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), I would like to thank you for holding your hearing on prescription drug prices. NACDS represents more than 170 chain drug corporations operating in excess of 21,000 retail drug stores. Last year, the chain drug industry filled 37% of all prescriptions in this country. Therefore, the issue of prescription drug pricing is of paramount concern to us. Creation of the new drug benefit program as part of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act will have a profound impact on the chain drug store industry. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that over 721 million prescriptions annually will be processed on behalf of 33 million beneficiaries under the new drug benefit program. In his comments before your Committee, Louis B. Hays, Acting Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) told the Committee that Medicare will pay the average wholesale price (AWP) for drugs covered under MCCA. He went on to say that AWP is significantly higher than actual costs of drugs. He compared AWP to the manufacturer's \"sticker price\" on a new car implying that it is rarely the price paid for the car or prescription drugs. Later, during the question and answer session, Mr. Hays claimed that Medicare payments of AWP for prescription drugs would provide significant financial rewards for retail pharmacies from the implementation of the drug benefit program. It is misleading to claim that under the MCCA drug reimbursement provisions that pharmacists will receive payments of AWP for prescription drugs. The MCCA statute states that pharmacies shall receive reimbursement for multi-source drugs at a level that is the lower of the actual charge for the drug, or AWP plus a $4.50 administrative fee, or beginning in 1992, 90% of the actual charge of the drug. As a result, payments under the new law will never be more than the pharmacy's actual charge or usual and customary prescription charge. This amount is a price set by competitive market forces. CBO's analysis of drug expenditures by the elderly shows that the retail pharmacy market is indeed competitive. The level of reimbursement of drugs will also be affected by lags in AWP price updates. The MCCA statute calls for a biannual survey to determine the AWP price for multi-source drugs. Once the survey is completed, the surveyed AWP price of the drug is not implemented until another six months later. Therefore, price updates may be delayed as long as up to 18 months and will in no way represent current AWP prices. The combined effect of the \"lower of\" clause and the delayed updating of AWP effectively limits reimbursement under the MCCA to approximately AWP minus 10 percent plus an administrative fee of $3.85 (based on 1987 constant dollars.) In addition, payment updates historically have not kept pace with inflation. In the last decade, we have seen this payment lag with physician fees, hospital payments, and Medicaid dispensing fees.429 Thus, statements by Mr. Hays perpetuates a fundamentalmisunderstanding of the issue of prescription drug reimbursementunder the MCCA and prescription drug reimbursement in general.This continued misinterpretation has also permeated HCFA'sreimbursement practices in the Medicaid program. NACDS believesthe MCCA statute clearly defines the parameters for prescriptiondrug reimbursement, and Mr. Hays' remarks only serve to furtherconfuse the issue of prescription drug reimbursement. In addition, NACDS strongly opposes implementation of an actualacquisition cost (AAC) reimbursement policy by public and privatethird party payers. Such action would be totally unacceptable tothe retail pharmacy industry and does not represent the operationof the retail pharmacy marketplace and reimbursement policy. NACDS believes any proposal to implement actual acquisition costmust be linked to payment of an adequate professional fee separateand distinct from the fixed administrative allowance fee containedin the MCCA. Fixed fees do not equitably compensate pharmacies for the differences in inventory and carrying costs for high-costprescription drugs. An actual acquisition cost reimbursement policy would removeincentives for retail pharmacy to be a product buyer and for amanufacturer to price drugs competitively. Such a proposal would substantially increase the cost of drugs to private and publicthird party payers and would be economically and politicallyunfeasible. Finally, the retail pharmacy industry is highly competitive.Therefore, in order to keep their customers, most pharmacies cannotraise their prices on drugs when the manufacturer increases itsprices. NACDS recognizes that the MCCA drug benefit program presents a major challenge to the retail drug industry. The volatility ofprescription drug prices in recent years adds another criticaldimension to the retail pharmacy industry as they struggle toremain competitive. As we move toward implementation of the drug benefit program we askyou to take our comments on drug pricing into consideration. NACDS looks forward to working with this Committee and others toensure that the drug program is financially sound and that itserves Medicare beneficiaries well. We would appreciate thisletter being made part of the official hearing record. R dL. gler430 .F. MARK L BRAUNSTEIN PMSkdent and Chief Operating Office, August 3, 1989 The Honorable David Pryor Chairman Special Cemmittee on Aging U. S. Senate, Room SD-G31 Washington, DC 20510 Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to commend you for having conducted the hearing on 'Prescription Drug Prices: Are We Getting Our Money's Worth?' As a physician and as an advocate of rational pre- scribing, I share completely your concern over rising drugcosts. I was also pleased to learn that you will be introducinglegislation to mandate a comprehensive electronic drug utili-zation review system for Medicare's forthcoming outpatientprescription drug benefit. Enclosed for your consideration is an information paper, 'Medicare Drug Utilization Review:Quality Assurance and Economy,' which addresses the very sameissue. The paper provides an overview of how and why a com-prehensive electronic DUR system will vastly improve qualityof care and substantially reduce health care costs borne by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers, and the beneficiariesthemselves. Should you deem it appropriate, I would very much appreciate your appending the information paper to yourJuly 18, 1989, hearing record. More than 15 years of commercial experience has placed NDC onthe 'cutting edge' of research and development technology in comprehensive, quick-response computer database-driven health care systems and programs. NDC's long tested and proven DURsystem, DATASTAT, is in use in thousands of hospitals,clinics and pharmacies across the nation. It has been suggested, however, that a comprehensive DUR system would be impractical and too costly for Medicare. NDC's experience is to the contrary, with a properly designed and implemented system. My contention, Mr. Chairman, is that Medicare and this nation's elderly cannot afford not to have a comprehensive DUR system. Thank you for your interest in this important matter. Sincerely, MARK L. BRAUNSTEIN, M.D. Enclosure431 MEDICARE DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW: QUALITY ASSURANCE AND ECONOMY AN INFORMATION PAPER By Mark L. Braunstein, M.D. President and Chief Operating Officer National Data Corporation Atlanta, Georgia July 1989 N Foreword Both the Congress and the Administration are to be highly commended for enacting the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. The Act includes an outpatient prescription drug benefit for the nation's 34 million Medicare beneficiaries, which will be phased in over a three-year period, beginning in January 1991. Equally, if not more, important to Medicare coverage of outpatient drugs is a provision in the Act for quality assurance through a computerized drug utilization review (DUR) system. If designed and operated properly, this electronic DUR system will greatly improve quality of care and save the Medicare program and its beneficiaries billions of dollars each year. Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers, and the beneficiaries themselves will spend less on drugs, which cost $18.00 on average for each prescription. More importantly, prevention of inappropriate and excessive prescribing through electronic DUR can substantially reduce the number of serious and life-threatening adverse drug reactions and interactions. Untold thousands fall victim every year to these preventable adverse reactions, which all too often lead to costly hospitalization and sometimes even death. National Data Corporation has developed, through advanced computer technology in health care systems, a highly sophisticated and proven electronic DUR system for ensuring safe, appropriate, and cost effective drug dispensing. Mark L. Braunstein, M.D.432 Medicare DUR: A Solution To The \"Other Drug Problem\" Inappropriate and excessive prescribing for the elderly has come to be known as our nation's \"other drug problem.\" Government-sponsored and university-based studies show all too clearly that the elderly often are victims of unnecessary, and sometimes dangerous, drug prescriptions. Older adults are more likely to be taking multiple medications for multiple illnesses, requiring the specialized care of two or more physicians. Consequently, the elderly are more likely to experience adverse drug reactions and interactions; and, as sensitivity to many medications increases with age, adverse reactions suffered by the elderly often are more serious. A 1986 Harvard Medical School Health Letter stated that \"research shows over- medication and adverse reactions to drugs are prevalent and have probably become epidemic among the elderly.' While individuals 60 and older represent only 17 percent of the nation's population, half of the deaths and over a third of the hospitalizations caused by adverse drug reactions reported to the FDA occur in this older population. The Public Citizen Health Research Group's (PCHRG) recently published study, \"Worst Pills Best Pills,\" estimates that in 1985 \"243,000 older American adults (60 and older) were hospitalized because of adverse reactions to drugs they were taking before their hospitalization.\" PCHRG further estimates that each year: * \"More than 9 million adverse drug reactions occur in older Americans; * \"32,000 older adults suffer from hip fractures attributable to drug-induced falling; * \"163,000 older Americans suffer from serious mental impairment [memory loss, dementia] either caused or worsened by drugs; * \"2 million older Americans are addicted or at risk of addiction to minor tranquilizers or sleeping pills because of using them daily for at least one year; and * \"73,000 older adults have developed drug-induced tardive dyskinesia [uncontrollable and involuntary-movements and shaking], the most common, and often irreversible adverse reaction to antipsychotic drugs.\" A study conducted by Vanderbilt University researchers in 1986 revealed highly inappropriate and excessive prescribing of powerful and potentially dangerous antipsychotic drugs for elderly nursing home residents in Tennessee. Almost 40 percent of the 20,500 dually eligible Medicaid/Medicare nursing home residents between the ages of 65 and 84 were prescribed these incapacitating medications which are normally used for treating schizophrenia in younger individuals. Harvard researchers reported in late 1988 on the use of psychoactive medications in a representative.sample of intermediate care nursing homes in Massachusetts. They found that over half of the 850 residents in these nursing homes were taking a prescribed psychoactive drug, including antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics, and powerful antispychotics.433 In 1988, a report by the Special Committee on Aging of the U.S. Senate stated that in 1986, \"as many as 120 million prescriptions (for elders) costing more than $2 billion\" may have been 'inappropriate.\" The report emphasized the need for a computerized electronic DUR system to reduce prescribing of addictive and powerful tranquilizers and antipsychotic drugs for the elderly Medicare beneficiaries, especially those residing in nursing homes. A recent study by the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that \"Nearly every prescription written in 1988 by physicians who graduated from medical school in 1960 is for drugs about which those physicians have received no formal education.\" The Inspector General also cited an earlier study conducted by researchers at Temple University Medical School, which showed that more than 70 percent of a group of physicians surveyed failed a test on knowledge of prescribing for the elderly. The Need for Electronic DUR In Medicare Pharmacists have long practiced drug utilization review as an integral part of quality assurance and prevention of drug-induced adverse reactions. DUR, however. has become increasingly important because of dramatic increase in the number of drug therapies over the last half century. Physicians now have more than 10,000 prescription drugs from which to choose in treating their patients. Consequently, most physicians find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to keep abreast of the latest information on the thousands of potential adverse drug reactions and interactions associated with this huge and growing assortment of drugs. The role of the pharmacist, therefore, has taken on increasing importance in detecting potential adverse reactions. Fully cognizant of this responsibility, pharmacists for years have kept close at hand such comprehensive compendia as the U.S. Pharmacopoeia \"Drug Information for The Health Care Provider\" and the \"Hospital Formulary.\" These voluminous reference compendia contain information on appropriate prescribing of medications, and precautions and warnings concerning potential adverse effects ofcertain drugs taken by themselves or in combination with other drugs. Potentially severe drug interactions alone number in the thousands, not to mention allergic and cross-sensitivity reactions, harmful drug-to-illness/condition effects, and reactions to incorrect dosage. As the number of new drugs continued to grow, day by day, so did the amount of time spent by the pharmacist to insure safe and appropriate drug dispensing. Pharmacists needed a quick, efficient and accurate way of retrieving this information which is so crucial to their patients' welfare, especially the elderly. Computer technology provided the solution. Electronic DUR Is Already In Use Today, at least 70 percent of the nation's 65,000 independent and chain pharmacies rely on some form of computerized electronic DUR. The Department of Defense (DoD) began a decade ago to install National Data Corporation's electronic DUR systems in its vast network of military hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.434 While these pharmacists continue to keep on hand their voluminous drug information reference compendia, the electronic DUR can almost instantaneously place at their fingertips the same vital information on their patients' prescriptions. The need for electronic DUR was recognized over a decade ago by forward- thinking pharmacists in both the private and government sectors. The worth and necessity of this time-tested mechanism was proven and established years ago. This nation's 34 million Medicare beneficiaries surely are deserving of no less. Electronic DUR Has Wide Support Electronic DUR for Medicare outpatients is supported by many professional and public interest groups, including: the American Medical Association (AMA); the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA), representing the nation's pharmacists; the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP); and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), a strong advocate of quality assurance and economy in Medicare. AARP represents 24 million members 50 years and older. Moreover, the Drug Utilization Review Act of 1989 was introduced recently in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to clarify and specify the intent of both bodies for a comprehensive Medicare DUR system. The Act also provides strict legal safeguards for protecting the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries and the confidentiality of patient-specific drug information. Senators Pete Wilson and John Heinz, original drafters of the bill, recognized that although less than 17 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will receive reimbursements because of Medicare deductibles, all beneficiaries will enjoy the benefit of drug utilization review. In addition to vastly improved quality assurance in drug utilization, the elderly will spend less on out-of- pocket drug costs. NDC's Electronic DU R System, And How It Works National Data Corporation launched its intensive ongoing effort to address the critical information needs of pharmacists 15 years ago, and continues to be in the forefront--on the \"cutting edge\"--of electronic DUR technology. In addition to providing its systems to more than 200 DoD medical facilities, including Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Medical Centers, NDC's electronic DUR is being used in thousands of pharmacies serving the general public, nursing home residents, and public and private health care institutions across the nation. The pharmacy in the U.S. Capitol, which serves the 535 members of the Senate and Congress, has relied on NDC's electronic DUR for the past eight years. DATASTAT*: NDC's Electronic DUR System DATASTATO is especially effective in that it provides the pharmacist with essential information on potential problems before the drug is dispensed. DATASTATO is a comprehensive, quick-response system which records on computer all pertinent information on each of the drugs prescribed for an individual patient. DATASTATO can, in a matter of a few seconds, alert the pharmacist of the following potential adverse effects: * Severe to mild reactions due to interaction of two or more drugs being taken concurrently;435 * Severe to mild reactions caused by two or more drugs from within the sametherapeutic class; * Potentially dangerous allergic reactions to drugs; * Harmful effects caused by noncompliance in taking medications, and by drug overdosing and abuse; and The newest DATASTATO alerts recently completed by NDC include: * Serious reactions caused by excessive drug dosage and duration; * Drug-induced problems caused by an interaction between a drug and an existing disease state. DATASTAT's utilization review for drug-to-drug interactions alone contains alerts for more than 8,000 potentially severe adverse reactions. In addition toidentifying the \"problem drga.' DATASTAW displays on the computer terminal a eaeription of the potential reaction or interaction. For purposes of consultation regarding a potential problem with the prescription(s), the pharmacist may also retrieve from DATASTAT the identities of the prescribing physician(s) and other pharmacists who may be serving the patient. DATASTATS Addresses Causes Of Inappropriate Prescribine DATASTATO is sensitive and responsive to the needs of the prescribing physician and dispensing pharmacist, as well as to the Medicare beneficiary. DATASTATO provides safeguards against the pitfalls of misinformation and the lack of information which may work against the conscientious efforts of dedicated physicians and pharmacists. The report published by the Senate Special Committee on Aging in late 1988 correctly states that The reasons [for inappropriate prescribing] can be attributed to the physician, the patient or both,' and cited the following examples: * \"The patient may intentionally or unintentionally fail to inform one physician that he or she is receiving prescriptions from one or more other physicians; * \"The physician may fail to question the patient about whether he or she is receiving prescriptions from other physicians; * \"The physician may not obtain complete information on the patient's medical condition which could affect the patients response to the drug prescribed; * \"The patient may fail to inform the physician of allergic reactions to certain medications; * \"The physician may neglect to question the patient about allergic reactions to medications; * \"The physician may prescribe the wrong dosage; and * \"The physician is fully aware of the patients condition, allergies and all of the patient's prescriptions but mistakenly orders an unnecessary or potentially harmful prescription.'436 The Senate report makes clear that, in addition to protecting the patient from adverse reactions, a comprehensive, quick-response DUR system also safeguards both the prescribing physician and dispensing pharmacist from the potentially disastrous consequences of misinformation as well as the lack of information. HCFA's Requirements for Medicare's Electronic DUR The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is the federal agency charged with developing and implementing by January 1, 1991 Medicare's computerized electronic point-of-sale (POS) system which includes Medicare's electronic DUR system. The POS will receive from the pharmacist via computer terminal all information on a prescription necessary for the Medicare claims processing and DUR functions. The claims processing portion of the electronic POS will process Medicare outpatient drug bills to determine if a beneficiary claimant is eligible and when the beneficiary meets and satisfies the deductible prior to Medicare reimbursement for outpatient prescription drugs. The task of setting up such a nationwide system for processing 720 million or more drug prescriptions yearly is by no means an easy one. HCFA is deserving of high praise and commendation for what has already been accomplished in development and planning of the POS overall. HCFA issued its request for proposal (RFP) on July 18, 1989, inviting private contractors to submit bids for developing, operating, and maintaining the POS according to HCFA specifications defined in the RFP. <-,> HCFA officials have consulted over the past year with individuals and organizations in the government and private sectors and in academia. NDC presented its DATASTATO electronic DUR system tr HCFA several months ago; and, following HCFA's issuance of the draft RFP this past May, NDC submitted its comments to HCFA regarding draft RFP specifications. NDC very much appreciated having had the opportunity to present its thoughts and views to HCFA and the public regarding the claims processing and DUR functions of the POS& As the nation's largest independent processor of point-of-sale (POS) transactions and a leading provider of electronic DUR to pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, and health care maintenance organizations (HMOs), NDC fully supports the concept of HCFA's program. But NDC reiterates its finding to HCFA in NDC's earlier comments on the draft RFP: \".. .HCQFA's innovative DUR program... falls short in a number of critical, clinically significant areas.\" NDC continues tosrecommend that HCFA broaden and strengthen its requirements and provisions for the electronic DUR system. As noted earlier in this report, DATASTATO's surveillance of drug-to-drug interactions alone contains more than 8,000 pairs of interacting drugs capable of causing potentially severe adverse reactions. HCFA's draft RFP lists only 231 such pairs; and, while this list of drug pairs does not appear in the final RFP, HCFA states that, at the time of contract award, it will provide an\"initial list of 225 to250severedrug-druginteractions.\" An analysis of the draft RFP's list of 231 interacting drug pairs shows that NDC's DATASTATO contains an additional 930 (75 percent more) severe interacting combinations associated with the draft RFP's list of 231.437 The American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA), American Society of HospitalPharmacists (ASHP), and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) haverecommended to HCFA in their comments on the draft RFP that the DUR component of the POS be expanded to include more interactions. AARP stated that it \"believesthat the DUR specifications as described in the draft RFP fall far short of Congress' mark.\" Regarding the draft RFP's DUR coverage for detecting problems withtherapeutic duplicates, severe potential drug interactions, and adverse effects fromexcessive dosage, the ASHP stated, \". .ASHP is extremely concerned about theincomplete and inaccurate information included in these three items\" (emphasis not added). More recently, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report,\"HCFA's Proposed Drug Utilization Review System Ignores Quality of Care Issues,\"requested by the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging. The GAO report, issuedless than a week after issuance of HCFA's RFP, states in part: [D]rug utilization review systems exist with capabilities far beyond those of the system being proposed by HCFA... [Tihe minimal DUR system proposed by HCFA is unlikely to be able to provide adequate information on safety... [lit is unclear why HCFA is developing its own DUR system when more comprehensive and well-tested systems already exist... HCFA's emphasis has been on financial considerations (specifically, bill paying procedures) rather than on the health and safety aspects of [DUR]... [Bloth the Congress and HCFA's top managers should understand the severe limitations of the system's capabilities. Analysis of the \"top 25\" prescription drugs used by the elderly in 19861 revealslarge gaps in the list of 231 drug interactions provided in the draft RFP for screeningin the Medicare DUR. HCFA, however, did not include in its final RFP a list of the225 to 250 which the agency plans to provide at the time of contract award.Therefore, it is not known at this time whether there will be changes in the drugs chosen for screening. Nonetheless, HCFA's anticipated list of 225 to 250 interactingdrugs for DUR screening will represent less than half of the potentially severeadverse interactions for the \"top 25\" drugs contained in NDC's DATASTAT40. Should HCFA provide to its contractors at the time of award the same list of 231interacting drug pairs contained in the draft RFP, this very limited list will fail toconsider and address potentially severe adverse interactions involving 13 of the V'Drug Utilization in the Us. 1986, Eighth Annual Reviee,\" Dec 1987, by the Food and DrugAdministration's IFDA) Office of Epidemiology and Binstatistics, p. 18. Table 7, which contains the heading -Prescribing or Drugs in 1986 for the Elderly (65 and Older),\" lists the 'top 25 Drugs asSpecified This table presents the latest such data published by the FDA. It is generally assumed that most of these medications have remained among those drugsheavily prescribed for the elderly since 1986.438 \"top 25.\" NDC's DATASTATO can screen for 597 pairs of potentially severe adverse interactions to the FDA's \"top 25\" drugs prescribed for the elderly. The draft RFPs list of 231 drug interactions includes only 63, or 10.5 percent, of DATASTATO's 597 interacting pairs associated with the \"top 25.\" Other weaknesses in draft RFP coverage of potentially serious problems associated with the FDA's \"top 25\" included: * Lack of coverage for therapeutic duplicates; * Dangers of exceeding maximum daily dosage; * Potentially severe adverse reactions to allergies and cross sensitivities; and * Precautions concerning drug-induced problems caused by drug interaction with specific diseases. The chart on the following page provides a detailed graphic display of what is covered by NDC's DATASTATO, and what was not covered by the draft RFP, concerning the \"top 25\" drugs prescribed for the elderly in 1986. THE JOB AHEAD NDC welcomes the opportunity and privilege to compete for Federal government contracts in the development and maintenance of Medicare's electronic point-of-sale and drug utilization review systems. NDC's 4,000 employees and corporate officers are confident that our 15 years of experience in electronic drug utilization review will serve exceptionally well toward establishing and maintaining optimal quality assurance and economy in Medicare's forthcoming outpatient prescription drug benefit.MEDICARE PROSPECTIVE DUR ANANALYS9IOFTHE TOP25 DRUGSPRESCRIBED FORTHE ELDERLY IN1986 POTENTIALLY SEVERE ADVERSE INTERACTION THERAPEUTIC ALLERGY CROSS.

Styrsky (904 E) Chief, Pharmaceutical Products Division Department of Veterans' Affairs Marketing Center P.O. Box 76 Hines, IL 60141 Dear Mr. Styrsky: On behalf of the Members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am writing to express my appreciation for your participation in the Committee's July 18 hearing, 'Prescr ption Drug Prices: Are We Getting Our Money's Worth?\". It was evident to all in attendance that you are a skilled manager who has much to teach the Congress regarding efficient governmental procurement of pharmaceutical products. As you could no doubt discern from the high level of interest of several Members of the Committee, your testimony was effective in establishing the potential for a wider role for the Department of Veterans Affairs in procuring prescription drugs for government agencies. I was particularly int-rested in the portion of your statement devoted to explaining the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and differentiating it from the bulk-purchasing associated with the Depot system. In an attempt to clarify several issues regarding the FSS, I would like to request your answers to questions that have arisen since the hearing. 1. You said at one point in your statement that DVA recognizes the need for a \"win/win\" end result. Would you please elaborate on that statement for the record? 2. It is my understanding that through the FSS, DVA is procuring pharmaceuticals for several agencies of government, acting under a delegation of procurement responsibility from the General Services Administration. Your testimony states that the 'Public Health Service was added-to the agreement in 1984\". Please explain the nature of this agreement, and supply the Committee with a copy of the agreement referred to in your testimony. If there is a specific statutory authorization for this agreement, please cite the appropriate section(s) for the Committee. 3. What is the approximate average volume of prescriptions' annually filled by DVA's outpatient pharmacies? What is the range of annual volume at DVA's outpatient pharmacies (please supply figures representing the highest and the lowest prescription volumes)? 4. What is the approximate average volume of prescriptions -annually filled by DVA's hospital inpatient pharmacies? What is tl.- range of voltme at DVA's hospital inpatient pharmacies (please supply figures representing the highest and the lowest prescription volumes)? 5. Given that under the FSS prescription drug products are delivered to individual DVA outpatient pharmacies and inpatient pharmacies \"through commercial distribution channels\", is DVA paying a higher price for prescription drug products that are delivered to (a) smaller (e.g. lower volume) pharmacy facilities, or (b) to pharmacies that are not associated with a hospital facility? 6. -When asked during the hearing whether Medicare could achieve discounts like those DVA has achieved if it negotiated with manufacturers, you declined to speculate, stating that Medicare is la different system\". I have a different question for you. If DVA were to negotiate purchase prices on behalf of Medicare for an additional several hundred _441 million dollars worth of prescription drug products annuallythrough the Federal Supply Schedule, do you believe DVAwould continue to realize at least its present level ofsavings? Is it possible that this increased buying powerwould result in DVA realizing deeper discounts? 7. For each of the prescription drugs listed on the attachedschedule, has DVA determined that another chemical entity(including those not listed on the attached schedule) istherapeutically equivalent? For example, are any of theanti-ulcer agents classified as \"H2 antagonists' regarded byDVA as therapeutically equivalent? If no suchdeterminations have been made, please explain why. S. Has DVA ever employed the designation of therapeuticequivalence to obtain more favorable bids frommanufacturers?

Yourextensive knowledge of the problems and opportunities faced bypharmacists who seek favorable wholesale prices from drugmanufacturers provided Members of the Committee with a rare glimpse of actual conditions in the market today. Further evidence of the Committee's interest in capitalizing on your expertise is embodied in the following questions,suggested by Members after the hearing. If you would be so kindas to submit written replies to these questions, your answerswill be incorporated into the official hearing record. 1. To what extent do volume purchases by pharmacies or theirbuying groups affect price? How effective, as measured bymanufacturers' willingness to discount their drug prices, are volume discounts in relation to other market strategies employed by various buyers of prescription drugs? 2. What effect, if any, is the Robinson-Patman Act having onretail pharmacists? 3. What effect, if any, has theeRobinson-Patman Act had on theability of \"non-profit\" entities to.'purchase drugs frommanufacturers (either directly or through wholesalers) at adiscount? 4. To what extent are pharmacy buying groups involved inbrokering of price discounts, relative to the entire retailmarket for prescription drugs? 5. In your opinion, would it be feasible for Medicare and/orMedicaid to employ strategies similar to those used by major buying groups, for example, by paying the Average WholesalePrice to pharmacists while obtaining a previously negotiatedrebate from manufacturers? 6. In your experience, relative to the published Average Wholesale Price, what is the difference between prescription drug prices charged by manufacturers to retail pharmacy chains(e.g., Peoples Drug) and independent retail pharmacists (e.g., Wall Drug, in Wall, South Dakota)?

ROBERT SALDIVAR Deputy Assistant Secretary forAcquisition and Materiel Management Enclosures 1. You said at one Point in Your statement that DVA recognizes the need for a \"win/win\" end result. Would you please elaborate on that statement for the record? A. All successful negotiators believe that both parties to the process must be satisfied with the outcome. Recognizing the magnitude of the drug procurement program and the costs associated with it make us fully aware of the need to be forceful negotiators. We also realize the importance of having the manufacturer agree upon a price they also consider to be \"fair and reasonable\" for the way we are buying relative totheir other customers. A negotiation that is so one sided as to have one party gaining everything at the expense of the other party will only occur one time. A \"loser\" in negotiations willeither be the big winner in the next contract or will not come back to the bargaining table. Negotiations require compromise by both parties to the agreement. This is what we strive for in our contracting efforts. 2. It is my understanding that through the FSS. DVA is Procuring Pharmaceuticals for several agencies of government.acting under a delegation of Procurement responsibility from the General Services Administration. Your testimony states that the \"Public Health Service was added to the agreement in.1984\".Please explain the nature of this agreement, and supply the Committee with a copy of the agreement referred to in Your testimony.

To formalize an agreement between the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) -Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Veterans Administration (VA), whereby DOD and VA will include PHS requirements for medical items approved for purchase under respective shared procurement consolidated contracts. Under this agreement, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), acting for the Public Health Service as the lead agency, will be authorized to process delivery orders against these contracts for shipment of their requirements to designated supply depots. II. BACKGROUND. A. In January 1978, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget, issued a memorandum to DOD, VA, DHHS (then DHEW) and GSA which assigned the lead role to DoD and VA for developing a program for improving the purchase and management of medical items. This assignment established the requirement for an equitable division of medical items between DOD and VA to eliminate duplication of procurement effort by the federal government at the central level for the same items. B. In June 1978, an interagency agreement between the DoD and VA established requirements for dividing purchasing responsibility, developing a joint item entry control system, and establishing procedures to review, simplify and eliminate the multiplicity ofspecifications. C_ Undet thp shared procurement concept, the purchasing roles of DoD and tp rVA involve preparation of product descriptions, determinaetonz.of contractor responsibility, and timely award and administration of contracts for products covered by this agreement in accordance with the laws and regulations governing Federal purchasing. Accordingly, the DoD and VA contracting officers are the only officials empowered by law to make interpretations and resolve disputes concerning the performance of their respective contracts. III.- RESPONSIBILITIES. A. DoD and VA agree: (1) To include PHS estimated annual requirements for medical items in their respective shared procurement contracts with a provision authorizing HRSA to process delivery orders for shipment to designated supply depots. (2) To provide PHS a copy of their respective solicitations when PHS requirements are included. (3) \"To notify HRSA within twenty four (24) hours of contract awards which include-PBS requirements. (4) To send HRSA one completed copy of the contract after contract award when PHS requirements are included. B. PHS agrees: (1) To provide a complete listing of the medical items it currently procures and stocks to the DoD and VA for evaluation and assignment to the appropriate agency for procurement. (2) To furnish required.data to DoD and VA upon request by the appropriate procuring activity. (3) To furnish the requirements of paragraph III, B. (1) and (2), within the time frames as established jointly with the DoD and VA contracting officials. 31-352 0 -90 -15446 (4) To provide an appropriate representative to serve on the Interagency Medical Procurement Management Committee. This committee is established to oversee shared procurement activities. (5) To provide a representative to serve as PHS coordinator for the shared procurement program. This representative will be required to maintain close liaison with the VA Coordinator and the DoD Program Manager regarding shared procurement activities. (6) To provide appropriate representatives to serve on established committees of the Shared Procurement Program Task Group. These committees provide an interface between participating agencies for procurement, review, coordination and market research of medical products. C. All parties agree; Not to take unilateral action without prior coordination on any data, e.g., exceptions, deviations, waivers, FDA certifications, etc. IV. SHARED PROCUREMENT COORDINATORS. A.

What is the range of annual vol0ume at OVA'S outpatient pharmacies (please supply figures representing the highest and the lowest prescription volumes)? A. The approximate yearly outpatient prescription volume for Veterans Health Services and Research Administration (VHS&RA) is 57,000,000 according to FY 1988 data. The volume range for VHS&RA outpatient pharmacies using FY 1989 data will be 8500 prescriptions per year for the lowest to 1,100,000 per year for the highest. -figures based on projections made using second quarter data 4. What is the approximate average volume of prescriptions annually filled by DVA's hospital inpatient Pharmacies? What is the range of volume at DVA's hospital inpatient pharmacies (please supply the figures representing the highest and the lowest prescription volumes)? A. This question asks for data on inpatient prescriptions. VA pharmacies dispensed 993,801 inpatient prescriptions in FY 1988. However, the number of inpatient prescriptions filled by the VA are insignificant and do not represent the major workload indicator for VA inpatient pharmacies. Inpatient workload is traditionally measured by doses. The VA dispensed over 168 million oral unit doses, 73 million ward stock doses, and 10 million intravenous piggyback doses in FY 1988. Additionally, 375 thousand hyperalimentation solutions, 2 million admixtures, and nearly 12 million fluids and administration sets were dispensed in FY 1988. As a key indicator variable, the volume range for inpatient unit dose are 4 million doses at the highest range and 100 thousand at the lowest range. 5. Given that under the FSS prescription drug products are delivered to individual UVA outpatient pharmacies and iquatient pharmacies roug commercial distrIbution channels\", is OVA paying a higher price for prescription drug products that are delivered to (a) smaller (e.g., lower volume) pharmacy facilities, or (b) to pharmacies that are not associated with a hospital facility? A. The primary objective of the Federal Supply Schedule program is to negotiate the contract for all of the government's requirements (i.e., total dollars) as a single customer. Under this premise there is one price for all ordering offices, regardless of size or the volume they purchase as an individual entity. To provide benefits for the larger ordering offices we are constantly attempting to negotiate quantity or tiered pricing which affords greater discount for quantity purchases. 6.- When asked during the hearing whether Medicare could achieve discounts like those DVA has achieved if it negotiated with manufacturers. you declined to speculate, stating that Medicare is \"a different system\". I have a different question for you. If OVA were to negotiate purchase prices on behalf of Medicare for an additional several hundred million dollars worth of prescription drug products annually through the Federal Supply Schedule. do you believe OVA would continue to realize at least its Present level of savings? Is it possible that this increased buying power would result in OVA realizing deeper discounts? A. While at first blush it might appear the obvious answer to this question is greater discounts should be realized, it is not that simple. This question is quite complex and subject to many variables beyond increased purchasing or contracting volume. It is difficult to put into perspective the inherent problem associated with Federal Supply Schedule contracting. One of the greatest obstacles is related to the issue of treating government as a single customer when there are more than 3,000 ordering offices and hundreds of paying activities. To deal449 with the question of adding dollar volume to the schedule is only half of the negotiation. If we were asked to add Medicare in a very broad sense that would make virtually every pharmacy in the nation an authorized user of the Federal Supply Schedule, I seriously doubt it would increase negotiating leverage and would more than likely reduce our effectiveness. Conversely, should Medicare have centralized ordering activities established that were under government control and possibly regionalized there could be a significant benefit in the added volume to FSS. The nature of the industry and its relation with the federal market would almost mandate government operation of Medicare ordering. The open-endedness of this question makes it most difficult to answer because of all the possible variables that could impact either in a positive or negative way. 7. For each of the prescription drugs listed on the attached schedule, has DVA determined that another chemical entity (including those not listed on the attached schedule) is therapeutically equivalent? For example, are any of the antic-ulcer agents classified as \"H2 antagonists\" regarded by DVA as therapeutically equivalent? If no such determinations have been made. please explain why. A. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has made no national determinations of therapeutic equivalence. Decisions regarding therapeutic equivalency are made at the local medical center based on a decision by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee as a part of the formulary management process. Historically, activities to control pharmaceutical expenditures in the VA have been based on locally-managed formulary actions such as strict formulary enforcement, restriction of the prescribing of high cost pharmaceuticals to clinical experts, prospective review of medication orders against appropriateness protocols approved by the P&T Committee, and increased vigilance on the part of the P&T Committee in controlling the numbers of therapeutically equivalent items on the local formulary. The cost of newer, more expensive pharmaceuticals and increased workload place increasing fiscal demands on the medical care budget. This has resulted in the VA exploring other options to control pharmaceutical expenditures. One option which is currently being explored is drug standardization (a National Core Formulary). Five medications have been selected for the initial test phase. This initiative has the potential to lead to a true national formulary which incorporates the concepts of therapeutic equivalency. The mechanism for implementation of a true national formulary system utilizing therapeutic equivalency concepts must include enough flexibility to allow variations indlocal medical practice based on patient needs. 8. Ha% DVA ever employed the designation of therapeutic equivalence to obtain more favorable bids from manufacturers? A. As the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not made any national determinations of therapeutic equivalents, there has been no national action by VA to obtain more favorable bids from manufacturers. The-VA-is currently testing the concept of standardization through a National Core Formulary. Five medications have been selected for the initial test phase. Additionally, another 50-100 pharmaceuticals are in the process of being identified for incorporation into the standardization process. This initiative has the potential to lead to a true national formulary system which may utilize the concept of therapeutic equivalency.450 Jerry L. Schwartz, Dr.P.B. 746 Hawthorn Lane Davis, CA 95616 November 3, 1989 Senator David Pryor, Chairman U.S. Senate Special Committe on Aging Rm. G-31, Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: This information addresses the issue of drug pricing and, specifically, the outrageous profiteering by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in their pricing of deprenyl (Selegiline) sold under the brand name ELDEPRYL. The information is supplied at the request of David Schulke, the Chief of Oversight for the Committee. Eldepryl was approved by the FDA in June for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. I wouldn't be surprised if the production cost is around 10 cents per tablet. Eldepryl is being sold for between $2.00 and $2.50 per tablet. Description and Action of Deprenyl Deprenyl was discovered in Budapest, Hungary, in 1964,by J. Knoll. It is produced by CHINOIN CHemical & Pharmaceutical Works, BudAat, Hungary. It has been usedin Europe for Parkinson patients for about 15 years. Sale of deprenyl began in Hungary in 1981 as JUMEX, in Great Britain in 1982 as ELDEPRYL, and in Austria in 1983 as JUMEX. It is called JUMEXAL in Switzerland and MOVERGAN in Germany. (Deprenyl, Eldepryl, and Jumax will refer to the same 5 mg tablet.) Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are related to the depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. The most widely used and accepted basic treatment of PD is the use of levodopa together with carbidopa, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. The combined pill is called Sinemet. However, the effectiveness of Sinemet declines after long term use. As a result, dosages of levodopa are increased and side effects increase in severity. The concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the monoamineoxydase (MAO) enzyme that normally inactivates dopamine, appears to be a logical strategy to maintain the desirable levels of dopamine product in the brain. However, the use of nonselective MAO inhibitors with levodopa could produce clinically dangerous hypertensive crisis. There are two forms of MAO, type A and B, which differ in their substrate specificity. MAO-A preferentially oxidizes serotonin and noradrenaline, phenylethylamine and Selegeline (deprenyl) is a highly potent selective MAO- B-inhibitor which preserves dopamine, and enables levodopa to supply dopamine more effectively and at a lower dose. This in turn decreases the dose-related side effects known to accompany levodopa therapy.451 In summary, conserves dopamine by inhibition enzyme monoamine oxidase (Type B) which rapidly inactivates dopamine in the brain. Eldepryl also inhibits the.dopamine reuptake storage mechanism and thus permits the available dopamine-to be used more efficiently. The addition of Eldepryl to .a levodopa regimen can reduce the amount of levodopa required by as much as 25 percent. -Eldepryl, used in combination with levodopa, also-helps to reduce the frequency and severity of hypokinetic/akinetic disabilities such as \"wearing-off\" or \"end of dose\" deterioration and early morning akinesia. No serious or irreversible side-effects have been observed, nor do tolerance or dependence occur with the use of deprenyl. It is a MAO inhibitor without the \"cheese effect\" in therapeutic dose of 10 mg. daily. Thus, it can be safely taken without dietary restrictions. Cost of Deprenyl I have Parkinson's disease and began taking Sinemet (levodopa * carbidopa) and deprenyl in 1986. I have been purchasing Jumex by mail from a pharmacy in Vienna, Austria. I was paying 458 Austrian shillings for a bottle of 50 tablets which, at the July 1989 dollar exchange, was $68.88 for 100 tablets or 69 cents per pill. The price was increased in 1989 by the Austrian pharmacy to 511.50 AS, which cost $76.93 per 100 pills or 77 cents per pill. I also paid postage. A friend purchased Jumex (5 mg) for me in Rome two different times for a cost of around $44 for 100 pills. Chiesi Farmaceutici markets Jumex in Italy. The price is printed on the package as 28,595 lira for 50 tablets for \"assisted patients\" plus 3,000 lira for nonassisted patients. According to the dollar exchange rate, the price would be $40-42 for assisted patients and around $45 for nonassisted patients. (A man in Davis, told me that his brother bought 1,000 Jumex tablets at a pharmacy in Vatican City for $333 or 33 cents per pill.) &T FOR DEPRIh PER 5 mg TABLET AT U.S. AND FOREIGN .PERMACIES (All prices are in U.S. dollars and cents at current exchange rate) Cost per tablet when purchasing Location of pharmacy 60 tablets 100 tablets 120 tablets Rome, 1Jaly A1.to .46 Vienna, bastria 49- Toronto, Cma 1.00 to 1.12. Davis, CiWitOrnia Davis Med. Center 2.38 .4.38. 2452 Some people were purchasing Eldepryl from Deprenyl Research Limited, Toronto, Canada, for around $1.00 to $1.12 per pill. Deprenyl Research Limited has informed its U.S. customers that they can no longer sell to U.S. customers due to an agreement with Somerset Pharmaceuticals to restrict sales to Canada. I telephoned Davis pharmacies to find out their prices for Eldepryl. Two of the pharmacies were regular and two were chains that discount their prices. The table on page 2 summarizes the cost of deprenyl in Davis (CA), Rome, Vienna, Toronto, and two mail order pharmacies located in Chicago and Champlain, NY. If Eldepryl (per 5 mg tablet) costs 45 cents in Italy, 79 cents in Austria, and $1.00 in Canada, why should it cost up to $2.43 in the United States? The reason is profiteering. The S.C. Johnson Company had the rights to Eldepryl. In 1986, senior management formed Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and purchased the Johnson ethical pharmaceutical assets in order to market Eldepryl. Somerset is located in Denville, NJ. Donald A. Buyske is Chairman and Taylor H. Maxwell is President. Patients will be taking two 5 mg pills per day. The cost will be around $1,700 per year or $142 per month at a regular pharmacy, and $1,460 per year or $122 per month at a chain pharmacy. Mail order costs would be $1,234 per year or $103 per month. Austrian prices are about one-third: $576 per year or $48 per month. In Italy, the cost would be around $321 per year or $27 per month. Somerset's Pricing of Eldepryl is Outrageous Eldepryl is a valuable drug for Parkinson's Disease;, it will be widely prescribed. There are indications that if Eldepryl is started early in the disease, it can slow the progression of the disease. Many patients will not be able to pay the price charged for the drug. The price that Somerset is charging is an outrage! I believe the only costs Somerset had were getting it through the FDA, the expenses of forming a new company, and purchasing the pharmaceutical assets. The pills are produced in Hungary and the cost after all these years should be minimal. Why should health plans and insurers, Medicare, Medicaid, and Parkinson patients get roasted? These high prices will raise the cost of health care. Somerset officers should reveal their costs and pricing policy. I compliment the Committee for looking into drug pricing. High costs of essential drugs create a burden for consumers, government, and health plans. If the Committee wishes to contact me for further information, I would be pleased to oblige. My telephone number is (916) 756-5196. Sincerely, Jerry L.

I am writing to invite you to testify at this hearing. This hearing will explore opportunities in the currentmarketplace for Medicaid programs, service providers and others to negotiate lower prescription drug purchase prices withmanufacturers. The Committee is interested in learning about possible models for bringing manufacturers to the bargaining table, and in identifying actions of manufacturers which may have thwarted previous attempts at such negotiations. Specifically, the Committee would like-you to address the following issues and questions in your testimony: 1. Please describe your role as Chairman of the Virginia State Medicaid Board, and the problems facing the State Medicaid program. 2. Given that pharmaceutical costs generally amount to less than 10% of medical expenditures, why is the State of Virginia seeking reductions in expenditures for prescription drugs? 3. What options is the State considering in its bid to lowerprescription drug costs, and what have been the responses of pharmacists and pharmaceutical manufacturers to these proposals? 4. Because of your unusual dual role as a community pharmacist and as a hospital pharmacist, you may have observed differences in wholesale prices available in each setting. If so, have youattempted to secure lower wholesale prices for your communitypharmacy, and what has been the response of the manufacturers you have sought to negotiate with? 5. Some have suggested that State Medicaid programs shouldnegotiate .prescription drug prices with manufacturers, pay each pharmacist the usual 'Average Wholesale Price, and dispensing fee, and then invoice manufacturers for a 'rebate\" or \"chargeback\" to account for the negotiated discount. Do you recommend that Congress work with States to negotiate lower prescription drug prices through such a \"chargeback\" or 'rebate' program? Please provide the Committee with 150 copies of your written statement on Tuesday November 14, 1989. The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on November 16, 1989, in Room SD-628 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. On the morning of the hearing, please check in at the Committee office in Room G-31 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building between 8:45 and 9:15 a.m. If you should have any questions regarding this invitation, please contact David Schulke of the Special Committee on Aging staff at 224-5364. O cereryeA vi ryor Chairman Enclosure 0413 November 15, 1989 Senator David H. Pryor Chairman U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging- 267 Senate Russell Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510-0402 Dear Sen. Pryor: ICN Pharmaceuticals is a small, California-based pharmaceutical company that makes, markets and sells 300 pharmaceutical products in the United States and internationally. The company has been in business for 30 years ant over this period has developed and gained commercial authorization to market a number of useful therapeutic compounds. The company is research-based and over the past decade has invested over $150 million in research and development for new pharmaceuticals, principally antivirals. ICN is a socially responsive company whose main mission is to improve the health of mankind through the development and distribution of useful pharmaceutical therapies. This is embodied in the company's motto: \"He who has health has hope and he who has hope has everything.\" As the founder of the company and an immigrant who fled from communism, I have a profound belief and respect for the American political system, and welcome the opportunity to respond to any and all questions that have been asked of us by the committee staff on our marketing practices for the drug Mestinon. My only regret is that due to the distance involved and the short notice of the hearing we received, I am unable to appear in person. In line with the company's philosophy, let me say immediately at the outset that it is the company's policy that no patient will ever be denied a drug marketed by ICN because of his or her inability to pay. This policy applies to Mestinon, which is used in the chronic treatment of Myasthenia Gravis. ICN maintains an indigent patient program whereby patients can obtain Mestinon free of charge. Any patient who is not able to afford their medication, who does not have health insurance, or who has had Mestinon purchases rejected for coverage by their health insurance can rec' ive their drug free of charge. Currently, 285 patients, repre.ear.ting approximately five percent of all Mestinon-treated patients, receive their drug at no charge through this program. Our indigent program is very simple. All a patient has to do is give us a request signed by the patient and his or her physician. In some instances, a copy of the patient's health plan indicating it doesn't cover prescriptions is needed. We don't check further. No questions asked. The committee staff has expressed interest about Mestinon, its price and the way the drug is marketed. The most useful way -to respond to these areas of inquiry is to recount ICN's history with the drug to date. At the time, ICN's hospital sales force had only one product to sell, an antiviral agent used in the treatment of hospitalized infants with severe respiratory disease. As part of a strategy to increase the number of products marketed by the company's hospital sales force, ICN acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Mestinon from F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. in June of 1988. The addition of products like Roche's line of anticholinesterase products, of which Mestinon is a part, makes the sales force more cost-efficient by spreading overhead over more products. This makes it more economical to maintain a hospital sales force. ICN's licensing strategy is-based on licensing products with smaller sales volumes. Simply put, we believe it makes more sense for small companies to handle smaller products and bigger companies to handle larger products. Big companies are better equiped to maintain large national and international dis- tribution systems for products with large patient bases. Small products often get lost in larger companies. Big companies often do not pay much attention to smaller products. Small companies can.455 Mestinon is a case in point. It is a drug of longstanding that is used to currently treat a total population of only approxi- mately 7,500 patients in the U.S. The average cost of Mestinon approximates $600 a year. In November of this year, a price increase of 8 percent was announced by the company. While we cannot address the pricing history of this drug before we obtained our licensing rights, this will be the first price increase in the 16 months since ICN assumed U.S. marketing rights. Although the 8 percent increase approximates inflation, it was really intended to offset the cost of capital improvements necessary for ICN to produce Mestinon. It also allows us to initiate research into new uses for Mestinon. Through this effort, myasthenia gravis patients, as well as patients in an entirely different disease category, may ultimately benefit from the fruits of this research. Moreover, the price increase allows the company to produce and distribute an educational videotape to physicians, such as opthomologists, most likely to encounter undiagnosed patients early in their disease. We believe that half the actual number of myasthenia gravis cases in the U.S. are currently undiagnosed. The committee staff has asked why the drug bank contracts were allowed to expire. In essence, the drug banks involve a two-tier pricing system. Following a review of the drug bank system in July of 1988, we determined that this pricing strategy was not conducive to the way ICN believes it should conduct its business. Our policy is to have one price for each of our products to the same class of customers. Under the two-tiered pricing system in effect under the drug banks, local drug stores are at a competitive disadvantage-to larger institutions receiving price breaks under the \"drug bank\" system. This is not consistent with the American economic system and it is against our general business policy as a company. Ninety percent of patients in the drug banks are covered by private and public health care plans. Because we recognized that the expiration of the drug bank contracts could possibly provide hardship to some, we provided a grant to Myasthenia Gravis Foundation, part of which was to be used to subsidize patients using the drug banks. Most important, the indigent program is open to all patients, including former drug bank users. Since acquiring the licensing rights, we have attempted to work closely with the Myasthenia Gravis .oundation. We have repeatedly asked the foundation for suggestions as to what contribu- tions the company can make toward helping for-the care and treatment of Myasthenia Gravis patients. Consequently, a $50,000 grant was awarded to the foundation in 1989 to support patient services, public and medical education and research. This grant is intended to be ongoing and themamount of future installments is currently under review. In summary, since the company obtained licensing rights to Mestinon, ICN has had concern that some patients, particularly those on fixed incomes without health insurance, may find it difficult to afford the drug. In order to avoid placing undue burden on these patients and any other patients who, for whatever reason, may feel a financial strain in obtaining their medication, ICN has made and will continue to make Mestinon available at absolutely no charge. We believe this action meets the needs of all Myasthenia Gravis patients, and is in line with our general corporate philosophy and the country's health care objectives. We would be more than happy to answer any questions raised by the contents of this letter as well as to continue further dialogue with the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in the interest of MG patients. Sincerely, Milan Panic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer MP:sab456 E6izabdL R. PrNckard 510 E. 86 Street, Box 44 N.w Yo0l, New YorA 10028 Senator David Pryor, Chairman U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Dear Senator Pryor, There is urgent need for federal legislation to regulate the amount of increase in cost of medications, especially main- tenance drugs for the chronically ill. Children,adults and the aged are all affected. Excessive increases in the cost of Mestinon, the most widely Prescribed medication for treatment of ?Ayasthenia Gravis, an auto-immune neuromuscular chronic disease is an illustration. Myasthenia Gravis can affect persons from infancy to old age, many are older men. It affects persons of all races and in all parts of the world. In-1988 the cost of a bottle of 500 Mestinon 60mg rose here in Qiw York City from $90 to $148.75 and in one supposedly cut rate store, $170 with a discount of 10% for seniors. Now, innraPsEa of 8 has been announced. Many Myasthenics must take 18-20 pills a day on a 24 hour basis, with some 30 pills a day. In addition many must also take Mestinon Timespan which costs around $75 for 100 pills. Some Myasthenics must also take Im- uran, Prednisone and others. Some now in their old age have beet taking Mestinon since they were young and thus able to work, raise families. It is an expensive disease. A member of my family has Myasthenia Gravis. Mestinon produced by Hoffman LaRoche is distributed solely in this country by ICN, a California concern. Thus the patient has no selection in purchasing this life sustaining drug. As the result of excessive increases and which may continue- 1'. Many will not be able to afford the medication which enables them to function, or take less thus limiting their ability to function, and become invalids aFurther financial drain on a family, resulting o'n serious deprivations on other family members. ,b Hospitalization will be necessary for many, often periodi- cally when unable to breathe. c.Nursing home placement for some often at public expense. 2. Increased health'care costs. Without federal regulations there will be no stoppage in fur- ther increases. Sincerely, November 12,1989 2 Q a s457 November 15, 1989 The Honorable David Pryor Chairman Select Committee on Aging United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 .Dear Mr. Chairman: At the July la hearing of the Special Committee on Agingrelating to prescription drugs, you released a staff briefing paperthat regrettably, and erroneously, asserts that most of the researchdone by America's pharmaceutical industry is of little value and thatmost of the new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration areof \"little or no' significance. As I said at the hearing, thatconclusion cannot be sustained by the facts. The enclosed report, AMERICA'S PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCHCOMPANIES -- A COST-EFFECTIvE SOURCE OF IMPORTANT NEW MEDICINES, showsthat contrary to the 'findings' of the staff, industry research and development produces significant new medicines and reduces the overallcost of medical care. For example, the U.S. leads in the discovery of\"world class\" drugs, originating nearly half of the new medicines thatachieved worldwide acceptance between 1975 and 1986. The staff calls its analysis of research and developmentoutput the me-too factor.\" If one were to accept the staff's view,nearly half of the drugs which the World Health Organization says areessential for health in every country in the world would be consideredof little or no value. I am also enclosing a recently publishedarticle by the Center for the Study of Drug Development at TuftsUniversity that concludes: \"Nearly one-half of the drugs present on the WHO essential druglist are available as a result of me-too research, and nearly one-quarter of the therapeutic indications described by the WHOessential drug list-are treated by drugs originally indicated totreat some other disease or condition.\" As the Special Committee on Aging continues its inquiryconcerning prescription drugs, I urge you to consider the facts ratherthan the flawed conclusions of the Committee majority staff.

Massachusetts ABSTRACT: Third-world health-advocacy organizations have criticized the pharmaceutical industry for expending excess effort in patenting modifications and new uses of already existing drugs rather than focusing their resources on developing innovator drugs. These groups contend that such \"me-too' and \"follow-on\" research yields drugs with little or no therapeutic value over innovator drugs and that underdeveloped nations suffer from this insignificant research. In order to examine this charge, we reviewed the 1987 World Health Organization's (WH.O) Essential Drug List to determine the extent to which innovator drug use is advocated. Analysis of 195 listed drugs representing 236 therapeutic indications reveals that nearly 50% of the drugs recommended by the WHO are not the innovator drugs of their respective classes. Additionally. nearly 25% of drugs on this list are included for therapeutic uses approved 'subsequent to the initially approved indicationts. These findings suggest that research dedicated to improving efficacy and safety profiles of innovator drugs. as well as discovering new therapeutic uses, is of medical importance to both developed and underdeveloped nations.

INTRODUCTION In the pharmaceutical industry, as in most health-related businesses, there is a conflict between the altruism expected of the industry and the industry's desire to maximize profits. Observers have,.from time to time, criticized the number and types of drugs marketed, the associated costs, and the research motives and methods employed to develop drugs [1-31. One of the most contentious of these criticisms is the driving force that profit motivation plays in a drug firm's decision to undertake a particular direction in research and development.

NY Wtin t5109-SXt3/89,/3.to459 In 1967, President Johnson charged the newly established Task Force on Prescription Drugs to undertake a comprehensive study of the problems associ- ated with the inclusion of prescription drugs as a Medicare benefit. In its Final Report. published in 1969, one of the major concerns expressed by the committee was the overabundance of \"duplicative. noncontributory\" drugs produced by pharmaceutical firms [41. For the most part, these drugs were characterized as molecular modifications. or \"me-toos.' of older drugs available on the market. Although concern about molecular modification research was noted first in 1961 Senate hearings. it was the Fi;tatl Rx port' that popularized the term \"me-too\" [51. Five years later. in their book Pills. Profits otid Politics, former Task Force members Silverman and Lee further emphasized their concern about me-too research [I]: Most molecular modifications have yielded only me-too products. The impact of the drug deluge on physicians-and therefore their patients-has long been a matter of senous concern. It is difficult to comprehend how any physician can cope with some 200 sulfa drugs. alone or in combination. or with 270 different antihistamines. or perhaps 100 major and minor tranquilizers. Would-be reformers of medicine and the pharmaceutical industry have continued to decry the proliferation of me-too research [6. 7]. Most recently, Health Action International IHAI), the umbrella organization for most third world health and consumer advocacy groups, has forced the issue into the international arena. One of their chief concerns is the proliferation of dangerous and noninno- vative drug products on the international market [8-11 !. HAI contends that profit incentives motivate the multinational pharmaceutical industry to spend too much time. effort, and money on me-too research, as well as on research directed towards finding new 'follow-on\" uses for already marketed drugs. These critics state that while such research yields great profits for the industry, it ignores the therapeutic needs of developing nations. and they advocate the adoption of such concepts as restricted drug lists. formularies. and other means of limiting the types and numbers of drugs available for global consumption [It1. Pharmaceutical firms and other industry proponents claim. however. that few of the major pharmaceutical advances of the past 50 years would have been possible were it not for me-too and follow-on research 112. 13]. Industry supporters hold that \"molecular modification is the essence of effective pharma- cology\" and that without it. most original advances would be unavailable ( 131. In addition. these proponents hold that newer drug products often offer significant therapeutic and economic advantages over originator drugs, including increased efficacy. patient compliance. and safety, as well as decreased total treatment cost 112. 131. Yet, despite contrary opinion, industry critics continue to contend that me-too and follow-on research is tnvial. insignificant, and inconsequential to the overall goal of improved health care. In order to investigate the validity of these contentions, we have examined the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Drugs for the inclusion of molecularly modified drugs, as well as drugs listed for therapeutic indications discovered subsequent to the originally approved uses. We chose this document as the basis for our analysis because of its global acceptance as a standard of essential therapy. The BIrtb of the Essential Drug Concept In a report to the Twenty-eigth World Health Assembly in 1975, the WHO addressed the concern of rational drug use in developing nations [14]. It was at this meeting, after reviewing the successful implementation of basic drug schemes by several countries, that the idea of an essential drug list was born. In 1977, after considerable consultation with experts in public health, medicine. pharmacy, and drug management, the Expert Committee on the Selection of Essential Drugs proposed an initial list. This document contained those drugs deemed by the WHO to be essential and necessary to address minimally the health and medical needs of any developing nation. The essential drug list recommends the formula- tions, administration regimens, and therapeutic indications for each drug. The WHO also established criteria for selecting essential drugs (15, 16]. An important criterion is that selected drugs be available within a country at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms. Additional selection criteria, based on local circumstances, include the epidemiology of prevalent diseases and conditions, the availability and location of treatment facilities, the expertise of health personnel, financial resources, and genetic, demographic, and environmental factors. All essential drugs must be proven safe and effective in clinical use and have adequate and documented stability and bioavailability data. When more than one drug is available to treat the same indication. the drug and formulation chosen should possess the best benefit/nsk ratio. In determining this ratio. policymakers must consider efficacy, safety, quality, total treatment cost. and availability.460 The essential drug list is revised when the Expert Committee feels that \"definite advantages are considered to accrue\" to the therapeutics of the indication(s) in question [16]. The Expert Committee reviews and updates the list approximately every 2 years to account for changes in global health priorities. as well as progress made in pharmaceutical research. This list is intended to serve as a universal model. which each developing country adapts to its particular medical and drug needs. The list is not to be considered the definitive tool in framing national formularies: rather. it is meant to help developing nations identify a \"common core' of basic drug needs [ 151. Much of the opposition and controversy surrounding the essential drug list. however, is concerned with its potential use as the basis for restricted drug lists. formularies, or as a policy for reimbursement purposes [12. 17). METHODS We reviewed all substances listed in each of the five versions of the WHO Model List of Essential Drugs 115. 16. 18-201. Because we were interested in drug entities. we omitted all devices. blood substitutes. immunologicals and vaccines, vitamins and minerals. diagnostic agents. solutions used to correct fluid and electrolyte disturbances. fixed combination products. and oxygen. Through the use of these selection criteria. less than 30% of all drugs listed in each essential drug list were dropped from analysis: in 1987. 26.7% of all drugs were excluded from analysis. The remaining drugs represent 21 major therapeutic categories listed by the WHO in its essential drug lists. The WHO further broke down these categories into specific subcategories. For example, the therapeutic category, cardiovascular drugs, is comprised of five subcategories: antianginal drugs, antidysrhythmic drugs. antihypertensive drugs, cardiac glycosides, and drugs used in shock or anaphylaxis. For analysis. we retained the major therapeutic categories, using the subcategories to ascertain the therapeutic indications advocated by the WHO for the listed drugs. We used several sources' to trace the international clinical and regulatory histories of each of the remaining drugs in all versions of the essential drug list. Because it represents the most current list. we emphasized the 1987 version in our analysis. We then determined whether: I) the drug was a molecular modification of an already existing compound. and 2) whether each drug's listed indications were follow-on indications subsequent to the originally approved indication(s). For the purposes of this study, a me-too drug was defined as a substance in the same chemical class and used for the same therapeutic indication as the innovator drug. Me-too drugs were counted once per therapeutic category, although. in some instances. a single drug was listed more than once within a therapeutic category because it was listed under multiple subcategortes. Drugs listed in more than one therapeutic category and that were me-too drugs in each category were counted once for each applicable category. For example, codeine was counted as a me-too in the analgesia category, as an antidiarrheal in the gastrointestinal category. and as an antitussive in the respiratory tract category. A drug with indications approved subsequent to the first approved indica- tionis) was considered a follow-on drug.' As with me-toos. drugs with follow-on indications were counted once per therapeutic category. An example of a drug with multiple follow-on indications is propranolol. originally indicated for use in cardiac arrhythmias and subsequently approved for angina. hypertension. and migraine headache. We assigned me-too and follow-on status for each drug and its indication(s) listed in all versions of the essential drug list. We examined the drugs included on the five essential drug lists by tabulating the number of total drugs. total indications. and the indications per drug for each list. We then determined the proportion of me-too drugs to all analyzed drugs by essential drug list version and by the WHO designated therapeutic category. A similar analysis was performed for the inclusion of drugs with follow-on indications. RESULTS The net number of essential drugs has grown with each essential drug list revision (Table I). The total number of drugs listed in 1977 was 208: by 1987. the number was 266. an increase of 27.9%.

The indications per drug also rose steadily over the 10-year period. Me-too Analysis. Overall, nearly one-half (48.7%) of all drugs analyzed in the 1987 essential drug list are me-too drugs. While the absolute number of me-too drugs has risen steadily, it has been accompanied by increases in the number of total new drugs added (Table 2). Thus, the proportion of me-too drugs to total drugs has, remained fairly constant. In 1987, a total of 21 new drugs was added to the essential drug list: of these. 17 met the criteria established for inclusion in our analysis. Twelve (57. 1 %) of the analyzed drugs represent molecularly modified compounds. The majority (64.7%) of these-new me-too drugs are antiinfective agents, with six indicated for use against tropical diseases such as malaria and trypanosomiasis. Figure I illustrates me-too drugs as a percentage of total drugs listed in 12 selected therapeutic categories. The therapeutic categories included in Figure I represent those categories with either a sufficient total number of drugs or adequate percentages of me-too drugs to warrant graphic presentation. Drugs in these categories represent nearly 94% of all analyzed drugs. Eight therapeutic categories included 50% or more and respiratory tract drugs. The hormone category has the greatest proportion of me-too drugs, due most likely to the fine-tuning required of the original adrenal corticosteroids and contraceptive hormones in order to lessen their side effects. Of interest is the fact that neither the beta-blockers nor cephalosporins. two drug classes traditionally maligned for their me-too spin-offs, are included as me-too drugs; indeed, cephalosporins are not even listed as essential drugs.

For example, two of the diuretics. hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide, are derived from chlorothiazide, and six penicillin denvatives arise from the original benzylpenicillin.Penicillin G. Follow-on Indications Analysis. A total of 46 drugs (23.6%). representing 58 indications. were listed in the 1987 essential drug list for therapeutic uses approved subsequent to the initially approved indication(s) (Table 3). Of these drugs, 19 141.3%) are also listed for their onginally approved indications. The number of drugs with follow-on indications included in the essential drug lists has steadily increased for each revision. with the largest jump seen in the 1987 version. Unlike the situation noted with the me-too drugs, in 1987 only one new drug, di-Methionine. first used as a nutritional supplement, was listed with a follow-on indication for use as an antidote. Six previously listed drugs, however. were listed for new therapeutic indications. It is these new indications for already listed drugs Table 3 Analysis of Drugs on the Essential Drug List with Follow-on Indications Analyzed Analyzed Follow-on Follow-on Year Drugs' Indications' Drugs (%) Indications 1%) 1977 159 171 30418.9M 32(18.7) 1979 171 188 35 420.5) 37 (19.7) 983 178 201 37 (20.7) 42 (20.9) 1985 187 214 39 )20.9) 48 )22.4) 1987 195 236 46 )23.6) 58 (24.6) -tnP and -aly iclusion. 20 40 00 s0 100 i OF TOTAL DRUGS Figure 2. Drugs with follow-on indications as percentage of total drugs for selected therapeutic categories. that count for the increasing presence of drugs with follow-on indications on the WHO essential drug list. This fact is most dramatically evident in the 1987 list, where nearly one-quarter (24.6%) of all listed indications (236) are follow-on indications. In that same list, the percentage of drugs with follow-on indications increased 17.9% from the 1985 list. Figure 2 illustrates the percentages of drugs with follow-on indications in II selected therapeutic categories. These categories. representing 86% of all ana- lyzed drugs. were graphically depicted because they had either a sufficient total number of drugs or adequate percentages of drugs with follow-on indications. Five therapeutic categories are notable for their high proportions of drugs with follow-on indications: antiallergics. antidotes. gastrointestinals. ophthalmologi- cals, and respiratory tract drugs. The antiallergics category has the greatest percentage of drugs with follow- on indications. The four drugs in this category-dexamethasone, epinephrine. prednisolone. and hydrocortisone-are hormones whose predecessors were all first used in adrenal insufficiency. In particular. hydrocortisone and epinephrine are each listed in 1987 for three separate follow-on indications. Of note is the fact that both have long been a part of the standard drug armamentarium; epinephrine was first used as a vasopressor and adrenal supplement in the early 1900s, and hydrocortisone was originally used in Addison's disease in 1952.463 DISCUSSION Because our definition of me-too drugs is based on similanties in chemical structure. rather than the physiologic effect or mechanism of action. determina- tion of a drug's me-too status is conservative. For example. indomethacin. an indole compound, and ibuprofen, a propionic acid derivative, are both considered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. They both have analgesic properties made possible through their inhibitory actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis and. with a less conservative definition. could be considered me-too drugs of the analgesic progenitor. salicylic acid. We did not consider indomethacin and ibuprofen to be me-toos of salicylic acid. however, because of their distinctly different chemical structures. We also did not include as me-toos those drug categories derived from an innovator drug that was originally a member of a different therapeutic class. For example, we did not consider the thiazide diuretics to be me-too derivatives of the sulfonamide antibiotics. although thiazide diuretics were discovered as an off- shoot of sulfonamide side-effect research. Given that it is discoveries of entirely new therapeutic classes that often constitute medical breakthroughs, our analysis thus underestimates true me-too research and development. Medical history is replete with examples of new therapeutic classes that have arisen from methodical tinkering with already-existing compounds. Figure 3 illustrates this concept as it applies to the 1987 essential drug list. Four important therapeutic classes of drugs included on that list-sulfornamide antibiotics. diuretics. uricosurics. and oral antidiabetic agents-are ultimately derived from the drug prontosil. discovered by Domagk more than 50 years ago. Underlined in this figure are those drugs currently listed in the 1987 essential drug list. Other. less dramatic examples exist in the essential drug lists. Molecular changes in mercaptopurine. and azathioprine. an immunosuppressant. Cocaine, an analgesic, eventually gave rise to the cardiovascular and anesthetic drugs procainamide. lidocaine. bupivicaine. and tetracaine. Research antihypertensive. Pheny- toin. a congener of the barbiturates originally used as sedatives. proved useful in treating epilepsy. Finally. another barbituate congener. thiopental. is widely used in general anesthesia. To analyze the contributions made by me-too and follow-on research. we chose the WHO essential drug list because it represents. on an international level. a pared-down model of the most basic drugs needed to alleviate the health and medical problems facing developing nations. Much of the current criticism aimed at the pharmaceutical industry regarding me-too and follow-on research comes from the international arena. The WHO essential drug list, however, is not the only vehicle for analysis. Other possibilities for further research include state Medicaid formularies. Health Maintenance and Preferred Provider Organization formularies, and national formularies, such as those used in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Finally, while we present a quantitative picture of me-too and follow-on research, we have not tried to judge whether the inclusion of such drugs and indications represents an improvement over the innovator drugs. Nor have we examined the omission of drugs often regarded as the \"gold standards\" in most Western countries. We address this problem indirectly. however. by illustrating the importance of me-too research, as well as citing specific examples. Other investigators have also examined the therapeutic improvements made possible by me-too and follow-on research [13. 21-231. CONCLUSION Third world health advocacy groups, led primarily by Health Action Interna- tional. have been prominent voices attacking the pharmaceutical industry's research motives and actions. We refute the contention that the industry's research leads only to useless and redundant drugs that harm less affluent nations. Our study demonstrates that me-too and follow-on research play a vital role in producing drugs that benefit underdeveloped countries. Nearly one-half of the drugs present on the WHO essential drug list are available as a result of me-too research, and nearly one-quarter of the therapeutic indications described by the WHO essential drug list are treated by drugs originally indicated to treat some other disease or condition. The global acceptance of the essential drug list testifies to its medical and public health significance. As of 1987, more than 100 developing countries have prepared essential drug lists. another 24 are presently in the planning stages of essential drug list adoption. and another 19 nations are seriously considering the concept [241. If. as promoted by the WHO, the essential drug list in fact is composed of drugs that are truly essential. then our findings illustrate the importance of me-too and follow-on research.PRONTOSIL-SULFANILAMIDE-DIURIETICS Example of how me-too research within a therapeutic drug class results in the discovery of other Iherapcutic classes and indications.

HAI News April:3-5. 1988466 AMERICA'S PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH COMPANIES A COSTEFFECTIVE SOURCE OF IMPORTANT NEW MEDICINES November 15, 1989 Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association AMERICA'S PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH COMPANIES -- A COST-EFPECTIVE SOURCE OF IMPORTANT NEW MEDICINES EXECUTIVE SUMM4ARY Contrary-to the recent findings\" of the staff of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, the research and development undertaken by prescription drug manufacturers produces significant-new compounds that improve existing therapies and drive down the overall cost of medical care. The staff's July 18, 1989 briefing paper, entitled Prescription Drug Prices: Are We Getting Our Money's Worth?, contains fundamental errors of data interpretation that lead to erroneous conclusions. The U.S. leads in the discovery of \"world class\" drugs. Nearly half of the new medicines that achieved worldwide acceptance between 1975 and 1986 originated in the United States. And over 80% of the most prescribed drugs in the United States were patented by private companies. These include dozens of breakthrough medicines for common and rare diseases. In the last decade, private companies have developed and received marketing approval for pioneering drugs that dissolve gallstones, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, break up blood clots, prevent anemia, fight cancer, and prolong the lives of AIDS victims. The industry's research investment grows every year. The portion of sales revenues reinvested into R&D by pharmaceutical research companies surged by 43% in the last 10 years, topping 16% of -i -467 sales in 1988, the highest for any established U.S. industry. This year, PMA member companies will spend $7.3 billion on R&D, exceeding total funding for biomedical research by the National Institutes of Health. Indeed, the unparalleled success of these efforts has enabled striking improvements in patient care; and it has allowed the U.S. industry to maintain a positive trade balance in the face of heightened competition from abroad. Unfortunately, these achievements and expenditures of resources are not reflected in the staff's briefing paper. Instead, the staff misconstrued available data in ways that lead it to the erroneous conclusion that the 'bulk of the research and development by prescription drug manufacturers produces insignificant new compounds that add little or nothing to drug therapies already marketed.' The opposite is true. There are five fundamental flaws in the staff's analysis: o An Inappropriate Measure of Pharmaceutical Innovation was Used in the Analysis: New Molecular Entities (NMEs) reflect the industry's contribution to the development of innovative new therapies and account for approximately 80% of all industry research expenditures. In fact, nearly half (47%) of the 182 NMEs were considered by the Food and Drug Administration to represent a significant or moderate therapeutic gain. The staff greatly diluted these achievements by also counting as \"new drugs\" hundreds of minor improvements to existing products (e.g., chemical derivatives, new formulations, Iv bags, and even generic drugs). o The Cost of Research and Development was Improperly Applied to all New Products: Between 1981 and 1988, PMA member firms spent approximately $26.2 billion on the development of NMEs and $6.5 billion on improvements to existing products. By incorrectly assuming that an average of $125 million is spent to develop each new product rather than only NMEs, the committee staff overestimated the sums spent to develop IC, rated drugs, concluding that \"as much as $37 billion' was spent. Studies by noted economists have468 indeed concluded that developing an NME costs over $125 million on average. Modifications to existing products obviously cost far less. o The FDA Drug Rating System is Not a Fair Measure of Pharmaceutical Innovation: FDA's rating system does not measure the ultimate or even current value of medicines on the market. Designed only to serve as an FDA administrative tool to allocate reviewing resources, the rating does not take into account that a drug's actual value to patient care evolves with widespread use. Such experience often reveals new uses, or added value to physicians who-need a broad selection of drugs in order to accommodate variation in patient response to medications. o The-Top 25 Firms were Improperly Chosen and Do Not Represent the Performance of Major Pharmaceutical Companies: The top 25 companies -- ranked according to prescription drug sales ---accounted for 61% of all \"A\" rated drugs and 69% of all NMEs approved between 1981 and 1988. The Committee staff incorrectly used a ranking of firms based or. sales that also included nutritional and over-the-counter products. Using this different group of firms, the staff concluded that the major firms developed only 39% of the \"A\" rated or \"important' new drugs between 1981 and 1988. o The Pharmaceutical R&D Process is Lengthy and a High Risk Enterprise: Drug development generally spans 7- 10 years from discovery to FDA approval. Only 1 out of 5 products tested in the clinic makes it to market. Many products are developed in parallel by different firms, and incremental discoveries during this process can lead to important therapeutic advances. In fact, a recent study of the World Health Organization's Essential Drugs List concludes that nearly 50% of the469 drugs recommended by the WHO are not the pioneer drugs of their respective classest For example, two of the recommended diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide, are derived from chlorothiazide, and six penicillin derivatives arise from the original benzylpenicillin, Penicillin C. Following the Committee staff's reasoning, one might conclude that these essential medicines are \"me-too\" drugs of little therapeutic gain. Considering the conclusions the staff reached from the data available, it is obvious that it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of pharmaceutical research and development and the high risks involved in the new drug discovery process. If analyzed objectively, the data contained in the staff briefing paper clearly shows that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is successfully developing new products that represent therapeutic advances, both by FDA'S standards and by current standards of physician care. We urge the Committee to consider the data itself, rather that adopt the staff's opinions about the data. INTRODUCTION The report prepared by the staff of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Prescription Drug Prices: Are We Getting Our Money's Worth? (July 18, 1989) (\"staff report\") attempts to examine the pharmaceutical industry's performance in discovering and developing innovative new therapies. The pharmaceutical industry invests billions of dollars a year in its efforts to develop new and useful products; this year alone, PMA member firms will spend over $7 billion in private funds on research and development. This investment has led to several successes, most notably that of the 50 most prescribed drugs in the United States, private industry was the source of 84% of these new drugs. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical industry welcomes all reasoned efforts to measure the efficacy of its research expenditures.470 The staff report, however, suffers from several fundamental flaws that cause it to present a distorted perspective on the value of recent pharmaceutical research. Indeed, rather than describing an industry that is a world-leader in product innovation and that is one of the most research intensive industries in the United States, the staff report paints a picture of an industry that has lost its creative edge and that -spends its resources mimicking each others' products. A careful reading of the staff report reveals several fundamental errors in assumptions and-analyses that have caused the staff to reach unwarranted conclusions. The analysis of pharmaceutical innovation and performance is based on a therapeutic rating system used internally within FDA. This system was neither designed to reflect industry's research performance nor to reflect a drug's ultimate medical contribution to patient care, a value that evolves with widespread clinical experience. In addition, a careful analysis of the data, founded in a more thorough understanding of the research and regulatory process, reveals that the staff's-conclusions present a biased description of the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry contributes to innovations in health care. I. AN INAPPROPRIATE ANALYSIS OF 1981-1988 DRUG APPROVALS HAS RESULTED IN FLAWED CONCLUSIONS A. All New Drug Products v. New Molecular Entities FDA's classification system involves rating a drug based upon its therapeutic potential as well as its chemical type. The system distinguishes between those drug products that are new molecular entities and those that are derivatives of already marketed products. Between 1981 and 1988, six different chemical types of drugs were approved that account for the 7811 \"drug approvals,: 1 According to FDA's records, a total of 781 \"new drugproducts\" were approved between 1981 and 1988, rather than the 776 analyzed in the Staff report. Other minor inconsistencies inthe exact numbers presented in Appendix A of the Staff reportwere also discovered, but do not warrant discussion. -2 -471 Type 1 New Molecular Entity: The active moiety has not beenpreviously markete in the U.S. Type 2 New Salt: The active moiety is marketed in the U.S. byMte same or another manufacturer, but the particularsalt, ester, or derivative is not yet marketed in theU.S. Type 3 New Formulation: The compound is marketed in the U.S.by the same or another manufacturer, but the particulardosage form or formulation is not. Type 4 New Combination: The product contains two or morecompounds which have not previously been marketedtogether in a drug product in the U.S. by anymanufacturer. Type S Already Marketed Drug Product: The product duplicatesa rug product already marketed in the U.S. by anotherfirm. Type 6 Already Marketed Drug Product by the Same Firm: Thepro uc adds a new indication for a drug product already marketed in the U.S. by the same firm. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is defined by efforts to discover new therapeutic agents to treat diseases not currently treatable or in a more effective manner. Such advances may appear modest, but be clinically significant to patients, or they may be dramatic breakthroughs based on a single major - advance in understanding a particular disease process or how the body's basic biological mechanisms can be influenced. Although all of the 781 \"new drug products\" approved between 1981 and 1988 offer some potential for more effective treatment, New Molecular Entities (NMEs) are the true measure of industry's innovative performance. By definition, NMEs are those products representing new chemical structures never previously available in the U.S. to treat a particular disease. The research and development underlying the discovery of a novel NME generally relies upon breakthrough discoveries that demonstrate the industry's commitment to the high risk process of drug discovery. Several studies of pharmaceutical innovation have been published, all of which rely upon the well-considered conclusion that NMEs are the best measures of innovative success.2 2 See Trends and Changes in Drug Research and Development,edited by Bryan C. walker and Stuart .walker, Kluwer AcademicPublishers, UK: 1988; 1980.472 The staff report contends that \"the bulk of research and development by prescription drug manufacturers produces insignificant new compounds that add little or nothing to drug therapies already marketed., However, the staff has improperly focused on all 781 new drug applications approved between 1981 and 1988. Instead, the analysis should focus on the 182 NMEs that account for approximately 80% of all research and development expenditures (PMA Annual Survey Reports, 1981 through 1989). Only about 20% is spent on the other 599 drug products representing chemical derivatives of marketed products, new formulations, new combinations, as well as duplicates of already marketed drugs. These non-NME approvals are new products that, by definition, should be evaluated on a different basis. PHA conducts an annual survey of sales and research and development activities applicable to ethical pharmaceuticals which represents the authoritative source of data on the industry. In this survey, firms are requested to provide data on how their R&D is allocated to the discovery of new ethical pharmaceuticals. Based upon responses over the 1981-1988 time frame, our data indicate that approximately 80% of R&D is allocated to research on new products and approximately 20% to significant improvements and/or modifications of existing products.

In fact, the data show that 47% of the UMEs approved were considered by FDA to represent a significant or moderate -therapeutic gain. This is a dramatic shift in emphasis from the staff's finding473 that 84% of the 348 new drugs brought to market by the 25 largest U.S. drug manufacturers offer little or no therapeutic advantage over existing drug therapies. TABLE 2 NEW DRUG APPROVALS BY THERAPEUTIC RATING 1981-1988 Therapeutic Rating NMEs A 23 \\ B 62/a C 97 TOTAL 182 B. Non-NME Drug Products Although NMEs are clearly the true measure of industry's innovative performance, an explanation of the 599 other drugs helps one to understand why these products should not be included in an analysis of innovation. As described earlier, the non-NME products generally represent modifications to marketed products -- new formulations, new combinations of drugs, new chemical derivatives of the active ingredient, or duplicates of an already marketed product. New formulations, or line extensions, account for 203 of the 599 drug approvals between 1981 and 1988. Although 175 of these were considered IC' products by FDA, they play an important role in health care delivery. Such modifications frequently address patient preferences, ease of administration, or other factors that influence patient compliance. For example, an oral product may be reformulated for intravenous use to facilitate hospital administration or may be formulated as a suppository to facilitate administration to elderly patients who have difficulty taking oral medications. Significantly, long-acting injectable forms of phenothiazines, for example, have improved chronic treatment of psychotic patients who often fail to take their medicines as prescribed. By limiting non-compliance problems, physicians can frequently avoid institutionalization (Wardell and DiRaddo, J. Clin. Pharmacol Vol. 20, No. 1, January 1980).474 Thirty-two products approved between 1981 and 1988 were new combinations of already marketed products. Although 28 of these products were considered \"C\" drugs, this category represents an effort on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to facilitate and improve drug therapy. Often patients take multiple medications, some of which are frequently prescribed simultaneously. Beta blockers and diuretics.are a good example of such a combination. By formulating two drugs into a single product, compliance is improved and confusion reduced for patients on complicated therapeutic regimens. The largest category of non-NME approvals (349) represent duplicates of already marketed drugs, including generics. Before 1985 when the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 went into effect and an alternative approval process was implemented, firms interested in marketing generic versions of brand-name products were required to submit a new drug application which was rated \"SC\" by FDA. These products, by definition, are not a measure of the industry's innovative performance. The \"duplicate product\" category also includes 168 (48%) Large Volume Parenterals (LVPs) or products that are primarily solutions administered in the hospital through intravenous administration kits. LVPs, although an essential part of inpatient hospital care, represent an insignificant percentage of the total amount spent on research and development by the pharmaceutical industry. In 1987, less than 0.2% of all R&D expenditures were committed to the development of large volume parenteral products (PtA Annual Survey Report, 1987-1989). Further, LVPs are largely considered a commodity market in which a manufacturer, in order to capture a hospital market, must offer a full line of products. Each of these products necessitates a separate New Drug Application, even if it merely represents a different percentage of a dextrose solution. In the 1980's, many of the 'new\" LVP products approved by FDA represented changes made to the plastic containers for these solutions, not to the solutions themselves. Because any solution475 in a plastic container is considered a drug, when the industry introduced new generation plastics that eliminate the use of polyvinyl chloride or that exhibit improved moisture/gas barrier properties, each product whose container was modified required a new drug application. FDA classified such products as IC, drugs. By analyzing the 599 non-NME drug products, one quickly realizes the impropriety of including these products in an analysis of pharmaceutical industry innovation. Although a large number of these products were considered IC' drugs, modifications that affect performance or patient compliance represent significant improvements to the delivery of medical care. Further, by not recognizing that this category includes generic drugs and LVPs due to regulatory requirements, the staff has dramatically masked industry's contribution to pharmaceutical innovation and improved health care. C. Cost of Research and Development The Committee staff concluded that the industry has been spending many billions of dollars on research and development for new drugs offering little therapeutic value. This conclusion, however, resulted from an inappropriate application of PMA's study which concludes that it costs $125 million to develop a New Molecular Entity. By assuming that the R&D cost for every approved product, NME and non-NME, is $125 million, the staff calculated that the top 25 U.S. drug makers spent $37 billion on R&D to produce 292 -C- drugs.3 A more accurate reflection of R&D expenditures dedicated to new drug development may be calculated from PKA's Annual Survey of worldwide R&D expenditures. From 1981 to 1988, a total of $32.7 billion was spent by PMA member companies on worldwide research and development. 3 The Staff has not only inappropriately applied theestimate from PHA's study to non-NME drug products, but has alsonot recognized that the average of $125 million includes the costof pursuing 'dry holes' as well as opportunity costs, i.e.,revenues foregone by investing in research and development ratherthan in opportunities with more immediate returns.476 Based on our data that approximately 80% of R&D expenditures during this time period was devoted to the development of NMEs, a more accurate estimate is that $26.2 billion was dedicated to the advancement of scientific knowledge and the development of novel products, while only $6.5 billion was spent on research oriented to significant improvements or modifications of existing products. However, it is inappropriate to view these R&D expenditures as directly related to the development of the drugs approved between 1981 and 1988. Because the drug development process spans seven to ten years, current research is targeted at developing future therapies to meet current and anticipated medical needs. In order to ensure a healthy and internationally competitive industry, U.S. pharmaceutical firms must be able to maintain state-of-the-art research programs. Current sales are, from a practical standpoint, funding research programs designed to develop drugs to treat many of the significant unsolved medical problems that still face Americans. TABLE 3 R&D SPENDING BY PMA MEMBER FIRMS Year Worldwide Expenditures 1981 52.3 Billion 1982 2.8 1983 3.2 1984 3.6 1985 4.1 1986 4.7 1987 5.5 *1988 6.5 TOTAL $32.7 Billion * Estimated figure D. 25 Largest U.S. Drug Manufacturers The staff also focused heavily on an analysis of products made by the \"top twenty-five manufacturers (by sales) in the United States.\" It appears that these 25 firms were chosen based upon a listing that separately identified subsidiaries of the parent corporation and that included U.S. sales for not only prescription drugs, but also nutritional and over-the-counter products. Neither nutritional nor OTC products are germane to the staff's attempt to assess the industry's success in bringing innovative new therapies to market.477 PMA's Annual Survey, which measures U.S. sales for ethical pharmaceuticals4only and which takes into account corporate structure, identifies a different group of firms that we believe more accurately reflects the contributions of major drug manufacturers dedicated to the development of significant new prescription pharmaceuticals.5 The staff report claims that the top 25 companies accounted for only 44% of all new drugs and only 39% of the \"A\" rated drugs. When the data are analyzed using PMA's redefinition of the top 25 companies, a distinct shift in emphasis is observed. Rather than accounting for only 39% of all \"A\" rated drugs, our analysis demonstrates that the major firms were responsible for 61% of these important therapeutic advances. When the success of these firms in developing innovative new therapies is measured, the data are even more revealing. Statistics show that the major firms are responsible for 69% of the NMEs approved between 1981 and 1988. In fact, the top 25 firms accounted for 62% of the 85 NMEs considered significant or moderate therapeutic advances. TABLE 4 NEW DRUGS INTRODUCED BY 25 LARGEST FIRMS Committee staff PMA PMATop 25 Co.

(PMAAnnual Survey, 1987-1989) 5 Based upon 1987 U.S. sales, the top 25 companies shouldinclude: Abbott, American Home, Beecham, Boehringer Ingelheim,Bristol-Myers, Burroughs Wellcome, Ciba-Geigy, Glaxo, HoffmannLa-Roche, ICI, Johnson & Johnson, Lederle (American Cyanamid),Eli Lilly, Marion, Merck, Merrell Dow (Dow), Pfizer, Rorer,Sandoz, Schering, Smith Kline and French, Squibb, Syntex, Upjohn,and Warner Lambert. This ranking of the top 25 firms was notmodified to reflect recent mergers. 31-352 0 -90 -16478 Thus, by analyzing the drug approvals using a list of companies rated by sales that includes nutritional and OTC products while also failing to recognize corporate structure, the staff has presented a biased description of the extent to which large firms contribute to innovation in the prescription-based pharmaceutical industry. Further, by not focusing on the true measures of pharmaceutical innovation -- NMEs -- the staff has painted a biased picture of the industry's success in bringing innovative new therapies to market. II. FDA CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AS THE BASIS FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION As demonstrated by a careful analysis of the data on drug approvals between 1981 and 1988, a different picture of the pharmaceutical industry's performance is painted than that presented in the staff report. However, to comprehend fully the fallacy of the staff's conclusions, it is important to consider both the intent of FDA's drug rating system and how that system is influenced by the nature of drug research and development. The Committee staff incorrectly assumed that the rating system is a fair measure of pharmaceutical innovation. A. Intent of FDA System and What It Represents In an effort to accord the highest priority for review to drugs deemed to have the greatest potential for contributing to improved medical care, FDA instituted, in 1979, an IND/NDA classification system. That system is intended to provide a convenient administrative mechanism for categorizing drug applications based upon the drug's chemical type and therapeutic potential. The stated objective of the system is: \"For those New Drug Applications (NDAs) received after October 1, 1978, [to] decrease the total FDA processing time for approval of those judged to be promising therapeutic advances, while also decreasing to a lesser extent approval time for other new drug' applications., (New Drug Evaluation Project Briefing Book, FDA, March 1981). Those products deemed to be a major (A) or modest (-B-) therapeutic gain are to receive expedited action.479 The rating system is intended to provide a \"convenient way of describing drug applications upon initial receipt' and throughout the review process\" (FDA Staff Manual Guide BD4820.3, Feb. Ig, 1982) in order to provide FDA with an internal system for prioritizing activities. Because the clinical significance of a product may not be obvious immediately, some drugs that may have appeared to be \"C\" drugs during review may ultimately prove to have greater or unexpected therapeutic importance after widespread use. Despite such a finding, the therapeutic rating of the drug does not change following FDA approval. Indeed, as an internal FDA administrative tool, one would not expect the rating to change. Thus, the classification, finalized at approval, does not necessarily reflect a drug's current, or ultimate, contribution to patient care based upon long-term clinical experience. In fact, some of the more important advances in medical therapy have occurred during the post-marketing phase, while observing patients taking a drug for an entirely different indication. Drs. William Wardell and Lorraine Sheck highlighted examples of such discoveries, noting that some of the more important therapeutic advances of the past three decades were discovered in this~manner: ...all the main classes of psychotropic drugs (the majortranquilizers and both types of antidepressants); thethiazide for diabetes insipidus; the anti-parkinsonian action of steroids and phenylbutazone; anti-goutaction status epilepticus; the protective effects ofbeta blockers (and the probable protective effects ofplatelet modulators, including aspirin) against myocardialinfarction and coronary death; the use of aspirin andsulfinpyrazone in preventing stroke; and the'nonsurgicalclosure, by indomethacin, of patent ductus arteriosus inpremature babies. (Rational Drug Therapy, Vol. 17, No. 1,January 1983) The FDA itself has conceded that it is conservative in its allocation of \"A\" classifications. In 1980, Marion Finkel, M.D., then Associate Director for New Drug Evaluation at FDA, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, that FDA reserves the \"A\" rating for \"drugs that represent truly major advances from the therapeutic standpoint ...Because of our conservative definition, the rating of 1B has been applied to some drugs that other physicians might designate as 1A.- Dr. Finkel further emphasizes that:480 Because the final ratings are made at the time of approval and are often based on relatively limited data, and sometimes on narrowly defined indications for-use, it is certainly possible that with more widespread use, a drug would be found to be much more valuable (or, conversely, less valuable) than had been supposed. A rating of 1C (little or no therapeutic gain) does not mean that a drug does not possess certain advantages over other drugs. There are always patients who fail to respond adequately to older drugs or cannot tolerate them and will obtain benefit from a 1C drug; again, certain advantages may emerge after widespread use of a drug that were not apparent in the studies performed before marketing ...The FDA agrees that the final judge of the usefulness of a drug is the practicing physician. (New Eng. J. Med. 302(3):181-183, Jan. 17, 1980) As noted by Dr. Finkel, physicians are acutely aware of the variation in responsiveness among patients. Certain patients may not respond adequately, or cannot tolerate, certain drugs in a therapeutic class or they may represent a special situation based upon a compromised physiologic state. A broad selection of drugs with diverse characteristics and mechanisms of action gives the clinician the necessary tools to individualize a patient's therapy. Evidently, the FDA classification does not accurately reflect sound medical evidence generated through long-term clinical use. Further, FDA classifications are based on decisions made by individual reviewers and Division Directors, not on defined criteria in an open and systematic process. As a result, even as an administrative tool, the system is applied inconsistently and does not necessarily accurately reflect a drug's true potential. The staff report also implies that FDA's classification includes an assessment regarding whether the drug has the potential for large cost reduction, noting that a IC' rating means that \"the compound fails to provide significant economic advantages to the patient, compared to already marketed drugs used for the same ailment.\" This characterization of a IC\" drug is not, however, consistent with FDA's own definition and signifies an overreaching interpretation of that definition. The definition of a modest therapeutic gain (\"B\" drug) includes the potential for large cost reduction, but does so only by way of example of criteria to be used in the decision-making process. The rating does not imply that cost reduction must be a factor, as other improvements in medical care are also481 identified, such as elimination of certain adverse effects, less frequent dosing, and greater patient compliance. The staff appears to have concluded, by implication, that a IC' rating therefore fails to provide economic advantages. Such a conclusion is flawed and, indeed, prior to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, generic duplicates of off-patent drugs were classified as IC\" drugs -- proof that cost savings have been and can be associated with I\"C drugs. B. How Therapeutic Ratings are Influenced by the ResearchDevelopment Process The drug development process generally spans seven to ten years. It is therefore inevitable that innovative drugs capitalizing upon an advance in medical knowledge are often developed in parallel by several different firms. When this occurs, FDA will often assign all promising products with a high rating of therapeutic significance, but classify only the first drug to be approved in a class as an 'A.' All other products, by default, receive a 'C\" classification, without consideration of the possible advantages that they ultimately may offer. The system also does not recognize the importance to prescribing physicians of parallel development of multiple therapies. If, after widespread use, an 'Al drug is discovered to cause alarming adverse side effects, it is important for the physician to have alternative therapies available. By suggesting that the later-approved IC, drugs do not reflect innovative state-of-the-art research, the staff report displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the research and development process and the risks involved. Companies investing hundreds of millions of dollars in developing new substances have no guarantee that they will be first to market. Neither the FDA nor the pharmaceutical industry can a priori determine which avenue of research will be most fruitful. Thus, to suggest that companies that have invested years of effort and millions of dollars in an attempt to bring an innovative product to market are instead trying to mimic a product that may not have been approved or even existed during the-development process, represents an unfair exercise in hindsight that displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the R&D process.482 Major advances can also result from the cumulative effects of smaller discoveries relating to the biochemical basis for certain diseases or to additional indications not foreseen at the outset. Such advances have been seen in therapies for hypertension, asthma, and cancer. Perhaps one of the most dramatic examples is the finding that beta blockers, originally approved only for the treatment of dysrhythmia and hypertension, can also treat glaucoma, anxiety, thyroid disease, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, prevent migraines, and reduce mortality and the rate of reinfarction in patients who had already suffered a heart attack (Wardell and Shack, Rational Drug Therapy, Vol. 17, No. 1, January 1983). Despite these important discoveries, only one of the numerous beta blockers approved during 1981 and 1988 was rated as an 'A\" drug. Drs. Wardell and DiRaddo, in a study of pharmaceutical innovation, further caution against the intervention into, and misinterpretation of, outcomes from the complex research and development process: Since the medical value of a pharmaceutical innovation can only be fully evaluated after it has reached the market, the earlier in the process a compound is dropped the less will be known about its ultimate therapeutic potential. Thus, the full impact of a censoring process such as regulation that deletes products from ultimate evaluation can never be known. The clinical discovery of new uses for marketed drugs -- by either systematic or serendipitous means -is exquisitely sensitive to a reduction in the number of new compounds appearing on the market. (J. Clin. Pharmacol. Vol. 20, No. 1, January 1980) In fact, a recent study by the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University analyzed the World Health Organization's Essential Drug List, a list of products that has been globally accepted as a standard of essential therapy. The authors concluded that almost half of the drugs were \"me-too\"483 drugs, or substances in the same chemical class and used for the same therapeutic indication as the original drug in that class. Further, nearly one-quarter of the drugs were listed to treat indications that represent discoveries made subsequent to the first approved indication. Based upon these findings, the authors concluded that \"research dedicated to improving efficacy and safety profiles of innovator drugs, as well as discovering new therapeutic uses, Is of medical importance to both developed and underdeveloped nations.' (Wastila, L., Ulcickas, M., Lasagna, L., J. Clin. Res. Drug Devel. (1989) 3:105-115) SUMMARY In order to interpret correctly any analysis of the clinical significance of new drugs approved since 1981, it is important to understand that the therapeutic rating system is an inconsis- tently applied, vaguely defined, internal FDA administrative system. This classification, finalized at approval, merely reflects an individual's prediction about a drug's potential contribution to improved medical care based upon limited clinical trial data. A drug's actual contribution to patient care evolves during the post-marketing period when widespread clinical experience reveals new uses, adverse effects, and other new information. The accuracy of any assessment of a drugs contribution to medical care not only increases with time, clinical use, and the amount of research performed on the drug, but is also determined by the practicing physician who is faced with the need to individualize patient therapy. Even if the basis for the staff's analysis were valid, a careful analysis of the data clearly shows that the pharmaceutical industry is successfully developing new products considered to represent therapeutic advances, both by the FDA as well as by current standards of physician care. A review of the data, founded in a more thorough understanding of the research and regulatory process, can only conclude that the large research expenditures made by the pharmaceutical industry have resulted in, and will continue to result in, important new drugs for the treatment of the fatal and disabling diseases that plague Americans.484 MYASTHENIA GRAVISV NATIONAL OFFICE A.

Over the last two years, our patients have been victimized by enormous price increases. These increases resulted from the sale of the U.S. and Canadian distribution rights to the medications Mestinon and Prostigmine. Originally, our patients received low cost medications -through our drug banks as a result of special contracts granted by Hoffman-LaRoche Pharmaceuticals. In 1988, ICN Pharmaceuticals purchased the exclusive distribution rights from Hoffman-LaRoche. Within 10 months of that purchase, ICN discontinued all special contracts. Our patients suffered dramatically from a price increase of more than 150 percent. Patients like Kr. Jake Green had been spending nearly $400 each year on medications available through our drug banks. Suddenly, as the contracts expired, they had to spend approx- imately $1,000 a year for their life-sustaining medication. Last week we were informed that the price of this expensive, but essential, medication will be increased a minimum of an additional 8 percent. Myasthenia Gravis is a serious, potentially life-threatening autoismune neuromuscular disease. There is no cure. The prevalent treatment is control of symptoms with medication such as Mestinon. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation applauds your efforts to find ways to reduce these prescription drug costs and to make pharmaceutical companies accountable for price increases. We welcome the opportunity for Mr. Green to present his case on behalf of all myasthenic patients. And, we appreciate your invitation for the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation to participate in your November 16 Senate Hearing on this urgent problem. Sincerely, /1 A24t Roger D.

Jake has Myasthenia Gravis and is the victin of the profiteering attitude of the pharmaceutical companies that Inake and distribute his only life-sustaining medication. La Roche and ICN Pharmaceuticals have been increasing the cost of Mestinon by nearly 200% since 1987. In May of 1989 ICN denied any continuation of special pricing that allowed for Mr. Green to gmt his medi- cation at a reduced cost through an MGF drug bank. Mr. Green had paid $40 for this essential medication through the drug bank and after May he was forced to pay $87. Today Mr. Green was told that he would be pay 8% more as of December 1, an increase of 150% in seven months. If Mr. Green had not used the MGF drug bank and had gone to his local pharm~acy he would have paid $66 in September of 1988 and $130 today, and a higher price after December 1, 1989. Mestinon is the only medication that relieves his MG syp- tans; there is no generic substitute and La Roche and ICN are the only companies that make and distribute Mestinon in the United States. Jake's life will always be dictated by the disease and the pharmaceutical industry which can increase the cost of his medication without any regulation. 53 W. Jacdsnn Butevard, Suite 1352, Chiags, Patent (312) 427-847486 The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation has rzently taken a posi- tion to reject a sustaining grant from IICN Pharmaceuticals in light of of their appalling disregard for the plight of their patients. In their communication the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation has requested the elimination of the 8% increase and the reinstatement of the special contract. Myasthenia Gravis is a potentially life-threatening autoi-une disease that affects approximately 100,000 Americans. This disease affects the voluntary muscles that control one's breathing, walking, talking, or eating because of a decrease in message received by the muscles from the nerves. There is no cure. The US Senate Special Committee on Aging subconmittee, chaired by Senator David Pryor, will be hearing testimonies by Mr. Jake Green and others affected by the reckless profiteering of pharmaceutical companies. The hearings will be held at 9 a.m. on November 16, in Room SD-628 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C.

Estimated number of people with Myasthenia Gravis - 100,000.491 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (916) 322-5824 November 14, 1989 The Honorable David Pryor United States Senate Attn: David Schulke Senate C ittee on Aging Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senator Pryor: I wish to thank you very much for the opportunity to tell you about a program that has the potential of saving California taxpayers millions of dollars as well as improving the availability of pharmaceuticals to those Californiacitizens most in need, the Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The following comments and information addresses what the California Medicaid Program (Medi-Cal) pays for prescription drugs, and what steps are being considered in order to bring what this program pays in line with other third party payors. Currently, the Medi-Cal program spends over 150 million dollars per year on providing single source prescription drugs manufactured by approximately 50 companies to our beneficiaries. In paying average wholesale or 'list\" price for these single source drugs, Medi-Cal pays 20 percent to 80 percent more than -other publicly funded health programs. The reason for thisdisparity is that Medi-Cal does not receive any of the rebates or discountsthat are available to other publicly funded programs such as the State Department of General Services, the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense. and Los Angeles County. Under the Medi-Cal Drug Manufacturer Discount Program, we will be able to benefit in a similar manner from some of the types ot cost saving agreements enjoyed by these agencies. The discount-program will be implemented.in two phases. 'First,-using currentauthority found in program regulations, the Medi-Cal program will negotiate with drug manufacturers-who~have petitioned toihave their drugs added to the Medi-Cal Formulary. At the present time, petitions to add.drugs which have apositive fiscal impact on the Medi-Cal program to the formulary are being denied. The Department will seek ,to -mitigate the fiscal impact of any formulary additions through discount contracts. The discount contract would provide that the pharmaceutical manufacturer \"discount\" to the State a percentage of total expenditures.for the- specific drug once the drug is added to the Formulary. .Te second phase will be directed at those-,pharmaceutical manufacturers who currently have-drugs on the Medi-Cal Formulary. These manufacturers will be.invited to-enter into discount contracts with the State. If this approach is unsuccessful, then strategies to encourage ompetitive pricing between both Formulary -and non-Formulary drug. manufacturers will be implemented..Subsequently, if necessary, .Formulary regulations will be amended to add and/or delete drugs, based upon the resultant savings.492 The Honorable David Pryor Page 2 During the last legislative season, the Department of Health Services (DHS) sponsored legislation (AB 2148) which would have resulted in a minimum of $40 million in savings to the Medi-Cal program. Unfortunately this progressive legislation was defeated in the Assembly Health Committee following intense lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry. The Drug Manufacturer Discount Program we are currently implementing will be a longer and slower process that will not generate the type of immediate savings envisioned in AB 2148; however, it is a program that still possesses great benefits. It is not the goal of the drug discount program to \"get drugs off\" or reduce the size of the Medi-Cal Formulary. The Department recognizes the distribution and other associated industry costs that make up the price Medi-Cal pays. These factors, however, will be considered during negotiations. The Department also recognizes that California's tax-funded Medi-Cal program for the poor is paying considerably more for pharmaceuticals than any other governmental program. With drug discount contracts in place, the Department will be able to utilize tax dollar savings to offset the higher cost of newer generation pharmaceuticals or utilize the savings in other areas of critical program need. The beneficiaries of this program will be both Medi-Cal recipients, who will have access to the latest and most improved medications, and the California taxpayers, who will see more effective use of their tax dollar. I have enclosed additional background information on the Drug Manufacturers Discount Program which provides more detail. I hope this information has been of assistance to you. My staff and I will be very happy to discuss this issue with you and we remain available to provide you with any necessary information or support. Sincerely, .- John Rodriguez Deputy Director Medical Care Services Enclosures493 MEDI-CAL DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM BACKGROUND Medi-Cal program expenditures have risen dramatically the past decade. Even more alarming is the rate at which drug program expenditures have risen compared to all other services of the Medi-Cal program. Chart 01 illustrates the problem that has been occurring with respect to California Medi-Cal. It is interesting to note that since FY 78-79, drug program expenditures have increased 150%, while all other services have only climbed 50%! A significant reason for this rise in drug expenditures is the fact that we are paying top dollar for single manufacturer type drugs; whereas, many othcr major governmental health programs negotiate discount prices considerably less than what Nedi-Cal pays for the same drugs. The Department of General Services, the Veterans Administration, and Los Angeles County, for example, ha've long-standing negotiated drug price discounts for single manufacturer drugs as well as drugs that are available generically. Chart 02 illustrates the extremely high prices that Medi-Cal pays compared to other governmental program. While this chart only lists six drugs as examples, there are many other drugs which also have significant price differentials. As shown in Chart *3, these differentials, at least as reflected in the list of the top 50 drugs in dollar volume, can be very drastic. The state is now actively taking steps to implement a new cost effective approach to how it purchases these drugs so that the California taxpayer is not forced to pay such excessive prices in the future. The Medi-Cal program is a very large purchaser of drugs, although overall it comprises a small percentage of the manufacturers national or even state market share. Our total expenditures are over $600 million/year of which over $150 million is devoted to single source pharmaceuticals. The intention of the Drug Manufacturers Discount Program is to receive the most favorable prices for single manufacturer drugs on the Medi-Cai Drug Formulary. These prices should be comparable to prices offered by manufacturers to other governmental health programs. This discount concept would have no effect on the normal distribution of drugs to pharmacies by drug manufacturers and wholesalers. The mechanism for this discount program is very simple. Based upon the negotiated contract amount, (which would be a set percentage of reimbursement), and Medi-Cal drug utilization data, the Department would merely bill manufacturers on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual frequency for the discount amount due to the Department. This would be after the dispensing of the medication to the494 beneficiary and reimbursement to the pharmacy provider of the prescribed single source drug. There are several questions and concerns about the Drug Discount Program that have been raised which should be-addressed. One important question is, how will the discount program benefit Medi-Cal patients. The answer is that savings generated through discounts will allow us to expand the number of single manufacturer drug products on the Medi-Cal Drug Formulary. Decisions to not include drugs on the formulary are usually made on the basis that the drug in question is no better or worse than similar drugs on the Formulary but is more expensive. hanufacturer-discount contracts would allow for such drug additions to the Formulary by providing fiscal savings instead of cost to the Medi-Cal program. Another question is, what~is the likelihood of drug manufacturers -entering into these discount contracts? The answer is: that there is high potential for such contracts to occur. Due to the fierce competition among drug manufacturers and the large volume of drugs used under the Medi-Cal program, it is of great importance to manufacturers-to have their products listed on the Formulary. Furthermore, contracting with government health programs is commonplace for drug manufacturers (e.g., contracts with the U.S. Veterans Administration, the State Department of General Services, Los Angeles County, etc.) One additional concern, which has often been presented by drug manufacturer .representatives, is that because this discount proposal doesn't involve the Department taking possession of the drugs, as is the case with manufacturer contracts with other governmental programs, the overhead costs associated with distribution would not allow for large discounts. First of all, this assertion is not accurate because not all government contracts involve taking poanession of drugs. The State Department of General Services, for example, contracts with manufacturers for large discounts, but the drugs are distributed to the State hospitals through a wholesaler. Secondly, the cost of distribution is an. element that the contract negotiator would take into consideration. It is maintained-that a significant discount is appropriate for a payer like Medi-Cal that has a drug budget of over 1/2 billion dollars.495 In saminary, it is time for California and other Medicaid programs to move forward with this concept of discount pricing. The period when tax supported health programs for the poor and elderly are forced to pay \"top dollar\" for pharmaceuticals should end, and such programrshould be allowed to enter into the discount market as have other third party payers. Such efforts should be supported by the Federal Medicaid system even to the point of legislatively mandating that state Medicaid programs participate in such discount efforts. The task of implementing such a program will be difficult, but it is one that the California Medi-Cal program is committed to. It is strongly felt that such a program will result in significant program savings and provide a wider range of pharmaceuticals for Medi-Cal's 3 million beneficiaries. Support on the national level is needed and appreciated.

Pryor Chairmen U. .Senate Special Committee on Aging Washington, D.C. Dear Sen. Pryori ICN Pharmaceuticals is a small, California-based pharmaceutical company that makes, markets and sells 300 pharmaceutical products in the United States and internationally. The company has been in business for 30 years and over this period has developed and gained commercial authorization to market a number of useful therapeutic compounds. The company is research-based and over the past decade has invested over $150 million in research and development for new pharmaceuticals, principally antiviral. ICN is a socially responsive company whose main mission is to improve the health of mankind through the development anddistribution of useful pharmaceutical therapies. This is embodied in the company's motto, 'He who has health has hope and hs who has hope has everything.' As the founder of the company and an immigrant who fled from communism, I have a profound belief and respect for the American political system, and welcome the opportunity to respond to any and all questions that have been asked of us by the committee staff on our marketing practices for the drug Mestinon. My only regret is that due to the distance involved and the short notice of the hearing we received, I am unable to appear in person. In line with the company's philosophy, let me say immediately at the outset that it is the company's policy that no tientwill ever be denied a drug marketed by ICN because of his or her inabilit to a This policy applies to estinon, whlch is used n t conc treatment of Kyasthenia Gravis. -ICN maintains an indigent patient program whereby patients can obtain Mestinon free of charge. Any patient who is not able to afford their medication, who does not have health insurance, or who has had Mestinon purchases rejected for coverage by their health insurance can receive their drug free of charge. Currently, 285 patients, representing approximately five percent of all Mestinon-treated patients, receive their drug at no charge through this program. Our indigent program is very simple. All a patient has to do is give us a request signed by the patient and his or her physician. In some instances, a copy of the patient's health plan indicating it doesn't cover prescriptions is needed. We don't check further. No questions asked. The committee staff has expressed interest about Mestinon, its price and the way the drug is marketed. The most useful way to respond to these areas of inquiry is to recount ICN's history with the drug to date. At the time, ICN's hospital sales force had only one product to sell, an antiviral agent used in the treatment of hospitalized infants with severe respiratory disease. As part of a strategy to increase the number of products marketed by the company's hospital sales force, ICN acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Mestinon from F. Hoffmann-La Roche a Co. in June of 1988. The addition of products like Roche's line of anticholinesterass products, of which Mestinon is a part, makes the sales force more cost-efficient by spreading overhead over more products. This makes it more economical to maintain a hospital sales force.501 ICN's licensing strategy is based on licensing productswith smaller sales volumes. Simply put, we believe it makesmore sense for small companies to handle smaller products andbigger companies to handle larger products Big companies arebetter equiped to maintain large national and international die-tribution systems for products with large patient bases. Smallproducts often get lost in larger companies. Big companies oftendo not pay-much attention to year. n November of this year, a priceincresae of 8 percent was announced by the company. While wecannot address the pricing history of this drug before we obtainedour licensing rights, this will be the first price increase inthe 16 months since ICN assumed U.S. marketing rights. Although the 8 percent increase approximates inflation,it was really intsnded to offset the cost of capital improvementsnecessary for ICN to produce Mestinon. It also allows us toinitiate research into a new uses for Mhstinon. Through thiseffort, myasthenia gravis patients, as well as patients in anentirely different disease category, may ultimately benefit fromthe fruits of this research. Moreover, the price increase allowsthe company to produc-e nd distribute an educational videotapeto physicians, such as opthomologists, most likely to encounterundiagnosed patients early in their disease. We believe thathalf the actual number of myasthenia gravis cames in the U.S.are currently undiagnosed. The committee staff has asked why the drug bank contractswere allowed to expire. In essence, the drug banks involve atwo-tier pricing system. Following a review of the drug banksystem in July of 19S8, we determined that this pricing strategywas not conducive to the way ICU believes it should conduct itsbusiness. Our policy is to have one price for each of our productsto the same class of customers* Under the two-tiered pricingsystem in effect under the drug banks, local drug stores areat a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions receivingprice breaks under the 'drug bank' system. This is not consiatentwith the American economic system and it is against our generalbusiness policy as a company. Ninety percent of patients in the drug banks are coveredby private and public health care plane. Because we recognizedthat the expiration of the drug bank contracts could possiblyprovide hardship to some, we provided a grant to Kyasthenia GravisFoundation, part of which was to be used to subsidize patientsusing the drug banks. Most important, the indigent program isopen to all patients, including former drug bank users. since acquiring the licensing rights, we have attemptedto work closely with the Myasthania Gravis Foundation. We haverepeatedly asked the foundation for suggestions as to what contribu-tions the company can make toward helping for the cars and treatmentof Hyamthania Gravis patients. Consequently, a $50,000 grantwas awarded to the foundation in 1989 to support patient services,public and medical education and research. This grant is intendedto be ongoing and the amount of future installments is currentlyunder review.502 November 1S, 1969 Senator Davie R. Pryor Page four In *u ry, rince the company obtained licensing rights to Xeatinon, ICU haa had concern that some patients, particularly those on fixed income without health insurance, may find it difficult to afford the drug. In order to avoid placing undue burden on these patient. and any other patients who, for whatever reason,, may feol a financial strain in obtaining their medication, ICN ha mad end will continue to makc testinon *vailable at b u v noC caras We believe thi action mee the neede of Myastbhna Gravis patients, and in in line with our general corporate philosophy and the country's health care objectives. No would be more than happy to answer any questions raised by the contents of this letter as well as to continue further galogue with the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in the interest of NG patient.

The coverage by the trade publication FDC Reports \"The Pink Sheet\" attracted my attention and prompted my writing of this letter to you. As the President of a small pharmaceutical company I can advise you of drug products other that those you have targeted in your hearings which equally put financial strain on the health care delivery system in the United States. -My company markets a brand of levothyroxine at one third of the price as the market leader Synthroid (Boots-Flint) brand of levothyroxine. This drug is considered a \"grandfathered\" product because it has been on the market since before 1938 which as you know is when the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was enacted. Since such drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective they are marketed without -premarket approval. Therefore the development costs are not anywhere as burdensome or costly as a true innovator product. Boots-Flint has marketed this product for over 30 years as its previous corporate entity. In 1988 Synthroid was the thirteenth most actively prescribed drug according to American Druggist, February 1989 (Exhibit 1). It is the market leader for the treatment of hypothyroidism, showing a sales volume of approximately 90 million dollars as compiled by IMS America (Exhibit 2). Boots-Flint has continually raised the prices of the various potencies by approximately 20% per year according to Medi-Span (Exhibit 3). In fact they are such an attractive investment based on this highly profitable branded generic drug that the Flint Labs prescription division of Baxter Travenol was acquired by Boots in August of 1986 for the unheard of price of $550 million dollars. Please refer to Exhibits 4 and 5 which describe this deal. According to the above cited articles \"in 1985 Flint had pretax earnings of $33.1 mil., which was 61.6% of sales totalling $53.7 mil.\" and `83% of Flint's sales come from a drug, no longer under patent, to treat thyroid deficiency.\" This drug is a maintenance drug which must be used daily for-life from the time the disease is diagnosed. It is quite evident that many elderly patients now take this drug with many more to be added to the Medicare program as the population ages.

HOOTS IS NO SKAII-FLIfi WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING FIRM's U.S. Rx SALES PRESENCE; U.K. FIRM OFFERS 9 TIMES 1985 SALES FOR BAXTER's FLINT LABS Boots is paying a top premium of about nine times sales for Flint Labs to protect its abil- ity in the future to \"derive full benefit from the sales of its products rather than ceding a large partof the profit from products to licensees.\" The British company candidly explained its willingness to bid way above the going rates to purchase Baxter Travenol's retail drug business. Without directly mentioning the ibuprofen experi- ence, the company indicated its view of the sales it lost by letting Upjohn develop the U.S. tradename for the chemical. An expanded self-marketing effort In the U.S., Boots said, will create trademarks to lengthen product life-cycles. \"By launching and marketing products In Its own name.\" Boots said, the company \"will enjoy the ben- efit of the goodwill associated with Its products after the expiry of their patent lives.\" Boots has been forced to participate as a contract manufacturer and compete with gener- ics on a price basis in the U.S. ibuprofen market. Upjohn, by contrast, did S120 mil. in sales with its Motrin brand in the face of generic competition in 1985. Indicative of Boots' relegation to the ibupro- fen generic market, the company received two ANDA approvals.in late July for the 800 mg. dosage of ibuprofen, one under its Ru/en tradename and one without a tradename -presumably to supply other generic marketers. Flint las Wrung Big Profits Out Of Off-Patent Product Synthmid, Over 11% Pretax Margin In 1985 > The Flint acquisition will build Boots' U.S. sales force from.about 190 to 240-250, Boots said. In an Aug. 6 release announcing the purchase, Boots said Flint \"will provide a substantial increase.in-EBoots U.S. pharmaceutical sales and its-prospects.\" The British furm says it plans no reduc- tions in Flint staff. The acquisition, appears primarily as a long-term move to build on Boots' eight-year experience In the U.S. market..However, Boots declared that it expects short-term results. \"Rationalization in the overheads and sales-forces of the two businesses and wider market- ing will be achieved at an early stage, so that the combined operation will produce significantly greater overall sales and increase the profit .potential of existing products,\" the company said. Boots added BOTSIFUT CiOMBlINED 1955 SALES that \"this will partly be achieved because sales representativesof both businesses concentrate on visiting family doctors, andseezo U-.S. .................... tu the combined sales force will be able to handle each other's FUN LA$ * 4. F-D-C REPORTS August 11, 1986 According to the figures released on Flint, the Baxter subsidiary has an outstanding profit evel. In 1983 Flint had pretax earnings of 533.1 ril., which was 61.6% of sales totaling S53.7 mil. Boots noted that \"the combined sales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. of the Boots Group and Flint would have totalled S136 mil.\" in calendar 1985. Boots had 1985 U.S. sales of approximately S82 mil. Flint has maintained its profits while basing its business on in off-patent product, .S- 4trod (Oevothyroxine) for the treatment of thyroid deficiency. The product aocounted for 83% of Flint's 1985 sales (not including the chymopapain products), or 544.3 nill. Boots noted that alsthoatu Synthroid has been off patent for several years, it held 74% of the U.S. synthetic thyroid replacement market in 1985 and 57% of the total U.S. thyroid replacement market. I evothyroxine is viewed as one of the most difficult drug products to replicate with the same levels. Flint also markets Choloxin (dextrothyroxine) for reduction of cholesterol and two prod- ucts for treatment of burns and wounds, Flint SSD (silver sulfadiazine) and 7ravase (sutilains oint- ment). Boots is also getting the herniated disc product, chymopapain fChymodiactin/Discasel. The way was paved for the inclusion of chymopapain in the deal when Baxter acquired rights to Smith Labs' Chymodiactin brand in July (\"The Pink Sheet\" July 28, T&G-6). At that time, Baxter estimated that the world market for chymopapain is SIO-13 mil. annually. Boots noted that the active ingredients In Synthrold and Choloxin are manufactured by Flint in Kingstree. South Carolina, and Cleveland, Missi- asippi and tableted in Jayuya, Puerto Rico, in facilities leased with various parties and shared with other divisions of Baxter Travenol. Flint's other products are manufactured under contract by third parties. Flint's lack of facilities is not a negative for Boots. The British firm recently opened a $36 mil. production, warehousing and laboratory facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The company also has facilities in Palisades Park, N.J. Prior to the Flint purchase, but with the new facility, Boots was in the position of having a pipeline of products from overseas, the necessary manufacturing facilities, but a weak marketing structure. Boots was rumored to have offered Revlon more than the $700 mil. that Rorer paid to purchase USV and Armour. When Boots purchased its first toehold in the U.S. market through the acquisition of Rucker Pharmacal in 1977, it inherited a manufacturing facility with a number of production prob- lems. During a 1983 inspection by FDA, the company received a report from the FDA investigator with 30 alleged deficiencies. The new plant was recently inspected for production of an ibuprofen line extension and showed only one deficiency relating to the misrecording of a tablet punch die process. Boots said it believes the \"combined enterprise\" of its existing operations with Flint \"will have the cash flow and sales force upon which to build the scale of operation required to market new products in the U.S.\" The British firm said Its U.S. subsidiary \"is not yet big enough to handle the launch of major new products on Its own.\" With Flint, Boots plans to launch the antidepressant Prothiaden (dothiepin). That drug had been under license to Marion, which had been developing it for U.S. marketing until earlier this summer. When Boots repurchased rights to the product (\"The Pink Sheet\" June 9, In Brief). Boots also recently traded for rights to the erythromycin brand E-Mycin giving Upjohn exclusive marketing rights on the NSAID, flurbiprofen (Upjohn's Ansaid). Boots kept topical ophthal- mic rights to the drug.515 August 11, 1936 F-D-C REPORTS -5- Other products in pipeline include flosequinan (BTS 49465), an arteriovenous vaso- dilator that Boots said is in Phase II clinicals for hypertension in the U.S., U.K. and other European countries. Boots noted that the drug has demonstrated \"potential in the treatment of heart failure.\" The firm also has an antidepressant, BTS 54524, in clinicals. Another product, Furamide (diloxamide fuorate), is under investigation for the orphan indication of asymptomatic intestinal amebiasis. liquid; the topical corticosteroid F-E-P Creme; and the potassium agents Twin-K and Twin-K-Cl. In June, the firm also licensed the bulk laxative Konsyl from LaFayette with the option to buy. Boots is purchasing Flint for S555. mil. in cash \"plus a royalty based on future sales lof Flint products] once these are in excess of current expectations,\" Boots stated. To finance the acquisi- tion, Boots is selling 184 mil. common shares \"conditionally placed through the market at \u00a32.05 per share.\" Under an agreement with Boots, investment banker Morgan Grenfell & Co. is purchasing.or procuring purchasers for all the new common Boots shares. The acquisition is expected to be completed on Sept. 3. By comparison, Boots paid $25 mil. In 1977 for Rucker Pharmacal. The figure repreaented 16 times Rucker's 1976 net earnings of $1.5 miS. Rucker, a regional branded generic firm, had 80 detaflmen at the time of the purchase. U The Flint deal is a boon for Baxter Travenol. The company has gained almost SI bil. from the divestitures of Flint and American Critical Care. DuPont paid 5425 mil. for American Critical Care, approximately eight times 1985 sales of approximately $50-55 mil. and in the range of 30 times earnings (\"The Pink Sheet\" July 14, p. 3).

AKZO PURCHASES TWO U.S. GENERIC DRUG FIRMS, PHARMACEUTICAL BASICS AND COLMED LABS; DUTCH FIRM WILL BEGIN MARKETING GENERICS IN U.S. Akzo is entering the U.S. generic drug business with three \"exclusive\" generic products: amantadine, clofibrate, and carbamazepine. Akzo obtained the three products through the July I acquisitions of Colmed Labs and Pharmaceutical Basics. Akzo is combining the two Colorado generic companies into a new company, operating under the name VPF. Colmed received approval for carbamazepine 200 mg tabs (Ciba-Geigy's Tegretoi) on May 15. Approval for clofibrate (Ayerst's Atromid-S) was obtained by Colmed's Formutec division on June 16. The Formutec division subsequently received approval for amantadine (Du Pont's Symmetrel) August 5. Formutec was a division of Colmed established to handle soft elastic gelatin formulations. Pharmaceutical Basics will manufacture carbamazepine and market all three of the new generics for Akzo. Clofibrate and amantadine. however, will be manufactured and co-marketed by Chase Labs under an agreement with Colmed (\"The Pink Sheet\" Aug. 4, T&G-2). Pharmaceutical Basics produces only tablet and hard capsule dosage forms. Mo1rel516 IB1IST r. INTERNATIONAL Boots Co. Agrees to Acquire Drug Unit Of Baxter Travenol to Boost U.S. Sales By PAUL HEMP Stff Retr of ToT Wan Srr.Jo.u.te LONDON-Boots Co. said It agreed to acquire the Flint prescription-drug unit of Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc. for at least SIS million with the aim of boosting Its direct sales in the U.S. prescription- drug market. The British pharmaceutical concern conceded It was paying Baxter Travenol. a Deerfield. tIl.. medical-products concern. a high price for Flint, which reported 1985 pre-tax profit of $33.1 million on sales of S53.7 million and which has tangible assets of only about $13 million. But the company said the price was jus- tified by Flint's high profit margins and the difficulty in finding suitable drug com- panies to use as a base for a major assault on the U.S. market. Available U.S. pharmaceutical busi- nesses are scarce and the competition for them Is fierce.\" said Robert Gunn, Boots's chairman. Paying a Premium However, some analysts said Boots was paying a premium price for an essentially one-product business In a mature market: U3% of Flint's sales come from a drug no Monger under patent, to treat thyroid dell- *-tlency that Boots officials say has little sales potential outside the U.S. \"They're certainly not buying Flint for Its prod- ucts,' said Peter Woods. an analyst at De Zoete & Bevan. a London stockbrokerage. \"There's little market potential there.\" Boots's businesses include a chain of re- tail drugstores and the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and con- sumer products. A U.S. pharmaceutical division manu- factures and sells Boots products. But In the U.S., Boots mainly has operated by li- censing other companies to make and mar- ket its prescription drugs. For example. Upjohn Co. sells Boots's Motrin, one of the best-selling drugs in the U.S. for the treat- ment of rheumatism. Boots said it plans to finance the acquisi- Uion by selling about 184 million new shares, valued at $3.04 each, to raise $559 million. The company currently has about 735 million shares outstanding. Flint's sale completes Baxter Tra- venol's plan to withdraw from pharmaceu- ticals to concentrate on its hospital-supply and remaining businesses. last month the company announced an agreement to sellIts cntical-care drug unit to Du Pont Co. for S425 million. In May the company com- pleted the $165 million sale of its American Medical Optics unit to a SmithKline Beck- man Corp. unit. Market Expectations On the London Stock Exchange yester- day, Boots fell 13 cents, to $3.16. Its stock has been weak recently because of market expectations that the company would issue a large number of new shares. Company officials noted that Boots has several drugs under development that It hopes to bring to market in the next few years. A U.S. sales force wilt help the com- pany realize a greater share of the profits from new products, contrasted with its cur- rent licensing approach. For example, Boots said Upjohn real- IZed profits of $38.2 million on 1961 Motrin sales of S191 million, while Boots only made $13.2 million in royalties and other Income from Motrin. Boots says It needs a stronger base in the U.S.. which accounts for 28'l of the world drug market, to launch and market new products there. The company posted US. sales of $81 million in 1985. Boots, which reported net income of 201.4 million on sales of $3.15 billion for the year ended March 31. has recently been the subject of takeover rumors. But company officials said the Flint acquisition wasn't meant to thwart a takeover and had been contemplated for some time. Boots said the sale of new shares is the largest so-called vendor placing ever In London. Under the placing. Boots plans to Issue to Baxter Travenol new shares that Boots's merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell & Co:. will then purchase and sell to Institu- tional investors. Those sales are condi- tional. though, as Boots shareholders have the nght to buy all the shares back from the investors at the S3.04-a-share sale price.WSA517 fit 20510-2702. C..... 'E BRIRE December 26, 1989 The Honorable David Pryor Chairman Special Committee on Aging United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear David: I was extremely pleased to see that you have begun a series of hearings focusing on the pharmaceutical industry. I have long been concerned with many of the questions you are raising in your hearings. I am forwarding to you a letter from one of my constituents, Don Arnold, R. P., President-elect of the Nebraska Pharmacists Association. He makes some valid points and I want to ensure that his concerns were made a part of the official record of your hearings. Again, David, thank you for holding these very important hearings. I will look forward to reading the findings and suggestions you have at the end of the process. With warm personal regards. ,21e* X y, ..ited States Senator Enclosure519 Dec. 9. 1989 Dear Sen. lxon, I wish to express to you my views on two subjects that concern pharmacy and that concern my patients equally as well. The first is discriminatory pricing by the drug manufacturers. I have read where Sen. Kerry does not feel that this is a problem. I beg to differ with him: A company such as tSith. Kline, & French makes a product called Dyazide at a cost of approximately $9.00! They sell it to ae through the wholesalers at a cost of $304.67. They sell it to the hospital buying groups for $50 to $25. I believe it is highly unfair for me to have to charge my patients excessive prices when we should beable to purchase this for the same price that they extend to \"non-profit\" hospitals. This would be a tremedous savings for the elderly and others that have to take a medication such as Dyazide. The second point I would like to make, is the excessive price increases that the br-nd-name manufacturer's have been passing down to the wholesalers and to the pharmacies. The national inflation rate is between 6 lo 7% and yet the inflation rate on brand drug products has been running around 14% per year. This is excessive pricing and it is taking advantage of the elderly who take the greatest share of the medications. We all understand that the costs of materials goes up each year,but not at this rate: I am asking you to consider these points because too many people have turned their faces and looked the other way while our drug manufacturer's have been getting richer & richer! It is not fair to the American people I thank you for your attention to this matter: Respectfully yours. Don C. Arnold R.P. President-tlect Nebraska Pharmacists Association Arnold's Pharmacy 918 First St. Sutherland.

Mr. Tambi wrote to reply to my testimony at the Senate Special Committee on Aging hearings on prescription drug pricing that you chaired in November 1989. I understand that Lyphomed officials declined an invitation to appear at these hearings. Mr. Tambi erroneously characterizes the People With AIDS Health Group's project to assist PWAS (people with AIDS) in importing personal use quantities of pentamidine from England as illegal.\" The Food and Drug Administration has a longstanding policy of permitting medications to be imported by individuals under certain circumstances. Specifically, individuals are permitted to import medication provided that 1) the medicine is for personal use, 2) the quantity does not exceed a three month supply, and 3) the individual is under the care of a licensed physician in the United States. The PWA Health Group goes to considerable lengths to help individuals comply with these guidelines and I have gone on record many, many times to reiterate our agency's intention to do so. Although Lyphomed has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration repeatedly to issue a directive curtailing personal use imports of pentamidine, the agency has wisely declined to do so. Mr. Tambi also contends that the pentamidine imported by individuals may be unsterile, or may in fact be an unfinished product. Neither of these allegations is true of the pentamidine imported by individuals with the assistance of the PWA Health Group. Rather, the pentamidine imported with the assistance of the Health Group is precisely the same pharmaceutical product that had been imported by the. Centers for Disease Control for many years, and complies fully with the standards outlined in the FDA's personal use importation guidelines.521 On a technical note, I should like to point out that PWAs often refer colloquially to the device used for the administration of aerosol pentamidine as a \"nebulizer.\" In fact, the entire assembly consists of an air compressor and a disposable plastic nebulizer system, consisting of a connecting tube, plastic mouthpiece and filter. The Respirgard II nebulizer system, which must be completely replaced after each use, is the only one FDA approved for the administration of aerosolized pentamidine, but there are other models in use. While the retail price of the Respirgard II is around $8, as Mr. Tambi states, he neglects tomention that the device will' not operate without the air compressor. Compressors vary considerably in price, but often run hundreds of dollars. Finally, Mr. Tambi evades the very issue that drives ourclients to import pentamidine, a drug that is recognized as safe and effective in this country: the price. Certainly, he cannot deny that the price of pentamidine in this country is markedly higher than it is in England, nor has he been able to adequately explain the differential. Mr. Tambi may know AIDS activists who have received a satisfactory explanation of Lyphomed's pricing strategies for pentamidine. We do not. The anomaly of U.S. citizens importing life-sustaining medications because they cannot afford them here has drawn substantial attention to the issue of drug pricing in the United States. We agree with Mr. Tambi's suggestion that laws regulating such a vital component of our healthcare system deserve carefulconsideration by Congress and we fully support congressional efforts to prevent the sort of profiteering that has driven up theprice of pentamidine by nearly four hundred percent. We applaudefforts like those of your committee to better understand these issues and to help devise more equitable means of providing healthcare for all those in need. Again, thank you for your attention to these matters. If we may be of any further assistance, or if you would care to discuss these issues in greater detail, please do not hesitate to contact me at any time. Sincerely yours, /dh522 January 19, 1990 The Honorable David H. Pryor Chairman Senate Special Committee on Aging United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Mr. Chairman: The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association takesstrong exception to the November 16, 1989 briefing paper preparedby the majority staff of the Senate Aging Committee, whichrecommended the creation of a restrictive formulary for Medicaidbeneficiaries. Such a restrictive formulary would be costly andcounterproductive, and would relegate Medicaid beneficiaries to asystem of second-class medicine. I am enclosing, for your use and information, ourresponse to the Aging Committee staff report, entitledProtecting Medicaid Beneficiaries from Restrictive Formularies.,Our paper makes three critical points: o The indiscriminate exchange of one drug foranother can produce adverse effects or inferior therapeutic results. o There is a growing body of evidence thatpatients who are denied a full array of drug therapiesoften require more expensive alternative medical treatment, such as physician services, hospitalization,and surgery. o The U.S. patent system encourages innovation byrewarding it economically. Without the economic incentives, U.S. pharmaceutical companies could losetheir preeminent position in the world marketplace. We hope you will have an opportunity to review theenclosure, which responds to the very serious misconceptions which served as the basis for the majority staff's recommenda-tions.

Formularies typically exclude certain drugs and categories of drugs from reimbursement, thus greatly restricting their use in preventing and treating illnesses. The majority staff would restrict Medicaid patients to the lowest priced prescription drugs. The prices of these products would be established through negotiations between program administrators and pharmaceutical manufacturers. A drug still on patent would not be included on formularies if the patentholder declined to reduce his price. Patients instead would be switched by pharmacists to drugs deemed therapeutically equivalent, by program administrators.524 A number of states have used restrictive Medicaid formularies. Other states in recent years have moved to abolish or greatly expand their formularies. based on evidence that formularies do not save money and do more harm than good. The majority staff's endorsement of formularies was based on three false assumptions: 1. That there are no important differences between drugs in the same therapeutic class. In fact, there is no such consensus on therapeutic equivalence. Leading physicians and pharmacists reject this notion because of individual differences among patients. 2. That restrictive drug formularies which exclude certain drugs will save the Medicaid program money. In fact, there is increasing evidence that restrictive formularies cause total Medicaid expenditures to rise rather than fall. This is because patients who are denied drug therapies often require more physician services, hospitalization and surgery. 3. That forcing companies to lower prices in order to gain access to a formulary will have no harmful effect on U.S. pharmaceutical innovation. In fact, formularies undermine patent protection, and patent protection clearly affects the rate of pharmaceutical innovation. But the worst effect of formularies is on Medicaid patients themselves. By denying these patients the newest and often most effective therapies, formularies create a second-class system of medicine. ii525 PROTECTING MEDICAID PATIENTS FROM RESTRICTIVE FORMULARIES INTRODUCTION The second briefing paper prepared by the Majority Staff of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Skyrocketing Prescription Drug Prices: Turning a Bad Deal into a Fair Deal (November 16, 1989) (\"second staff report\"), continues the majority staff's attempt to evaluate the appropriateness of prescription drug pricing levels. PMA responded to the majority staff's first briefing paper, Prescription Drug Prices: Are We Getting Our Money's Worth? (July 18, 1989), with its own analysis of the facts in America's Pharmaceutical Research Companies: A Cost- Effective Source of Important New Medicines (November 15, 1989). Like the first briefing paper, the second staff report makes preliminary 'findings' based on its survey of pharmacy directors and physicians at a number of hospitals, Medicaid programs and health maintenance organizations (HMOsy. Originally, the staff was concerned about the federal budget impact of forthcoming drug reimbursement by Medicare, a program of special interest to the Senate Special Committee on Aging. With Congress's recent repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, Medicare no longer is scheduled to reimburse for outpatient drug purchases. Conse- quently, the staff's focus has shifted to Medicaid. Taken together, the staff's \"findings, suggest that pharmaceutical companies can be forced to negotiate lower prices for drugs if state Medicaid programs threaten to deny uncooperative companies the opportunity to have their products listed on Medicaid formularies. The staff asserts that even for drugs that are still on patent, Medicaid officials can stimulate price competition because there are different drugs in the same therapeutic class that can be substituted by the Medicaid program for the patented product. To deflect criticism that such a forced-negotiation policy could deny Medicaid patients needed drugs, the staff assumes that: I. There are no important differences between drugs in the same therapeutic class;526 II. Restrictive drug formularies which exclude certain drugs will save the Medicaid program money; and III. Forcing companies to lower prices in this manner will have no harmful effect on U.S. pharmaceutical innovation. As this paper will show, these assumptions are false. I. ASSUMPTION: There are no important differences between drugs in the same therapeutic class. FACT: DRUGS IN THE SAME THERAPEUTIC CLASS ARE NOT NECESSARILY -INTERCHANGEABLE. A. Consensus Does Not Exist on Therapeutic Equivalence. The majority staff contends that 1(p)hysicians and pharmacists in over 90% of the nation's hospitals and at least 42% of U.S. health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have independently concluded that many prescription drugs are therapeutically interchangeable when used to treat patients suffering from the same ailment.' (Finding 3) But. in fact, there is no such consensus on therapeutic interchangeability. As John Ballin, PhD, of the American Medical Association recently wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Despite the efforts of segments of organized pharmacy to bring about therapeutic substitution legislation, not all pharmacists embrace such practices. Many pharmacists oppose therapeutic substitution because of liability concerns. Others think that they are not competent to make the clinical judgments involved in autonomous drug selection. Still other pharmacists are concerned about alienating physicians and fear that, if there is sufficient encroachment on the physicians' prerogative, doctors will begin dispensing drugs as well as prescribing them. Thus, within the ranks of the pharmacy profession, there is wide disagreement over the desirability of this practice. There appears to be more of a consensus within the medical profession about the merits of therapeutic substitution. Not surprisingly, physicians as a group are opposed. The American Medical Association has adopted a policy of vigorous opposition to 'any concept of pharmaceutical or therapeutic substitution by pharmacists.\" Similarly, the American Academy of Family Physicians has taken a strong position against the practice. Physicians are very concerned about potential serious consequences of therapeutic substitution on patient care, both in terms of lack of efficacy and adverse reactions. The hazards are particularly great for the elderly who may have multiple diseases, take multiple drugs, and possess very fragile biological systems.\" (1) The fact that therapeutic substitutions are practiced in some hospitals and HMOs does not mean, as the staff concludes, that the physicians in those institutions favor the practice.527 For example, the legislative committee of the Iowa Academy of Family Physicians has strongly recommended that Iowa physicians not sign an HMO or other managed-health-care contract that includes a therapeutic substitution clause (2). Many pharmacists, as Dr. Ballin noted, are also uncomfortable with therapeutic substitution, particularly outside the institutional setting as would be the case with Medicaid patients' filling their prescriptions at community pharmacies. According to William A. Zellmer, editor of the American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy: Pharmacy must recognize, when it advocates therapeuticinterchange, that the concept developed as a component ofthe hospital formulary system, which has long functioned effectively under voluntary practice guidelines. It would be a mistake to attempt to write therapeutic interchangeinto state laws for broad application in ambulatory care before there is substantial experience with the practice inthat area. (3) Indeed, state laws commonly prescribe therapeutic substitution in an outpatient setting. B. Therapeutic Inequivalence Can Result in Adverse or Subtherapeutic Effects and Toxicity. Different salts, esters, or dosage forms of the same active drug may differ substantially in efficacy, required dose, bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile, or incidence of adverse effects. Substituting one drug for another may sometimes alter therapeutic effects. For example, substitution may alter plasma levels and potentially toxic clinical effects; interchange among formulations with different particle or crystal size may cause variations in absorption, leading to discrepancies in bioavailability. Substitution between different salts and esters of the same chemical could make significant differences in the proportion of active drug released into the blood stream or major differences in the effect of food on the medication's absorption (4). Many case studies published in the medical literature describe important clinical differences between individual drugs in the same therapeutic class.\" For example, William H. Frishman, M.D., of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New528 York says interchange among the nine systemic beta-blockers now marketed in the United States may result in untoward results because of differences in potency (requiring different dosages to achieve the same effect), selectivity (regarding their relative abilities to block different beta adrenergic receptors on heart muscle cells), pharmadokinetic properties (affecting their appropriateness for patients with impaired hepatic or kidney function), application to various age groups, and adverse effects (5).- Another therapeutic class that has important clinical differences among individual medicines is nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which the majority staff identifies as anti-arthritis pain medication. According to one review article, there are 'up to 100 molecules now developed or in research\" in the nonsalicylate NSAIDs alone (6). The committees majority staff asserted NSAIDs have 'many interchangeable drug products\" (Finding 3). But highly individualistic clinical responses to different NSAIDs may occur in some arthritis patients, which may explain why chemically similar NSAIDs are not similarly effective in all patients. The same point is made in an article in DICP, The Annals of Pharmacotherapy, by Richard A. Levy, PhD, of the National Pharmaceutical Council and Dorothy L. Smith, Pharm.D., of Consumer Health Information Corporation: 'Patients are highly individualistic and the final prescribing decision must be based on therapeutic efficacy, safety, adverse reaction profile, concurrent therapy, simplicity of dosage regimen, patient acceptance and compliance, and overall cost of treatment.\" (7) II. ASSUMPTION: Restrictive drug formularies, which exclude certain drugs, will save the Medicaid program money. FACT: RESTRICTIVE FORMULARIES MAY DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. A. Restrictive Formularies Deny Medicaid Patients Needed Drugs or Force Them to Pay for Needed Drugs Out-of-Poaket.529 Many state Medicaid formularies deny patients the best drug. therapy on the market for several years after it becomes available. Between 1970 and 1980, Medicaid programs in California and Kentucky, the states with the most stringent formularies, averaged at least five years of additional delay before accepting new drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (8). Another study of six states between 1974 and 1982 showed average approval delays ranging from 11.6 months in Washington to 48.4 months for Kentucky. (9) Medicaid patients are sometimes denied \"breakthrough\" drugs that could save or prolong their lives. According to the first report of the National Commission on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome: The belief that Medicaid will pay for the health care needs of the growing number of low income people with HIVinfection and AIDS is, as one expert witness told the Commission, a 'Medicaid fantasy.'... ... One obstacle is the wide variation among states inMedicaid eligibility and scope of benefits. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under considerable public pressure, has struggled with mechanisms to speed new drugs to the market. Yet there is no requirement that Medicaid make even life-prolonging drugs such as zidovudine (AZT) available. (10) In Michigan, when 640 prescription drugs were removed from the Medicaid formulary in 1982, the program reported a 15% reduction in prescription claims. But a study by David M. Smith, a Michigan clinical pharmacist, and Patrick L. McKercher, PhD, an associate professor at Wayne State University, concluded that nearly half of the Medicaid recipients on continuous therapy had actually stopped being treated while another 30% of the recipients continued therapy at their own expense. \"The out-of- pocket payment category is under-represented due to the inability of documenting costs associated with alternate OTC (over-the- counter, nonprescription] drug therapy,\" the authors point out. (11) B. Evidence Suggests That Restrictive Formularies Cause Total Medicaid Expenditures To Rise Rather Than Fall. Medicaid programs in 19 states have restricted or closed formularies, where the state will reimburse only for drug products on the approved list. Most states have a prior-530 authorization mechanism to allow exceptions, although few physicians seem to take advantage of it because of the \"hassle factor.\" William J. Moore, Ph.D., and Robert J. Newman, Ph.D., of Louisiana State University's Department of Economics, conducted a PMA-supported statistical analysis of the experience of Medicaid programs in 47 states. They conclude: In this study we have examined the effects of state restricted formularies on the Medicaid program. While proponents argue that adoption of such regulations will reduce the drug budget and total program expenditures, our evidence suggest otherwise. Because of service substitution effects, we find that restricted formularies, by removing the method of preferred treatment, tend to increase rather than decrease the level of total Medicaid expenditures. We find no evidence to support the hypothesis that restricted formularies reduce drug expenditures. In fact, our evidence directly contradicts (in a statistical sense) claims that restrictive formularies reduce Medicaid expenditures. As an example, Moore and Newman noted that.several drug products were removed from the Louisiana state Medicaid formulary in 1976: Medicaid officials, at that time, estimated that the _ removal of these drugs would decrease the drug budget by 15.68 percent and provide a savings (reduced expenditures) to the total Medicaid program of $5.6 million... (A]ctual drug budget expenditures fell by about $3.6 million, or roughly 10.9 percent, but at the same time, total Medicaid expenditures rose by $27.1 million or approximately 14.1 percent. (12) Other investigators haveabeen reaching similar conclusions since the earliest studies.of the impact of Medicaid formularies. In the-early 19.70s, Robert W. Hammel, Ph.D., of the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy compared Medicaid expenditures in states without a drug formulary or with an open or unrestrictive formulary with expenditures in states maintaining a closed formulary. He concluded that states with a closed formulary spent more on Medicaid on a state per capita basis than did those without a restrictive formulary. (13) In 1982, the National Pharmaceutical Council, in cooperation with the Project HOPE Center for Health Information, sponsored a symposium and workshop on the effectiveness of medicines in containing health care costs. One of the papers presented at that conference, by Mickey C. Smith, Ph.D., of the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy and Susan Simmons, Ph.D., of the University of Iowa College of Pharmacy explored the relationships between a variety of Medicaid cost control mechanisms, including531 formulary restrictions, and three dependent variables: expenditures per eligible recipient, expenditures per actual recipient, and participation rate (number of recipients compared to number of eligibles). Between 1973 and 1980, they concluded that 'it would appear that formulary restrictions had little relationship to the dependent variables. Indeed, when such relationships were found, formulary limitations were often associated with higher overall drug expenditures.\" (14) [emphasis in original] Most recently, Frank A. Sloan, Centennial Professor of Economics at Vanderbilt University, examined the now-extensive literature on Medicaid formulary cost savings and concluded: Overall, there is no evidence from the single state or the multistate studies that a restrictive Medicaid drug formulary results in savings to the Medicaid program... In Michigan, such restrictions may have placed an additional cost burden on the needy. (15) III. ASSUMPTION: Forcing companies to lower prices of patented drugs by threatening to keep them out of state formularies if they decline to negotiate prices will have no harmful effect on U.S. pharmaceutical innovation. FACT: DILUTING PATENT RIGHTS UNDERMINES INNOVATION. A. The Patent System Creates A Period of Marketing Exclusivity for valid Reasons. Historically, the patent system in the United States has granted the innovator a limited monopoly for two reasons: 1) it encourages innovation by rewarding it economically and 2) it assures competition when the patent expires by requiring disclosure of information in the patent filing that otherwise would remain a trade secret. During the Kefauver hearings in the early 1960s, the patent protection afforded pharmaceuticals was challenged as being of less social value than the lower prices that could be expected from increased competition. The Aging Committee's majority staff is essentially making the same argument. As described by William S. Comanor of the University of California, Santa Barbara:532 What is at issue here is the appropriate level ofreturn from pharmaceutical innovation. This single questionis the unifying theme for much of the policy debate that hasensnarled the pharmaceutical industry in the postwar period.The essential question is the extent to which competitiveforces should be promoted or retarded so that the mostdesirable rate and pattern of innovation are induced. Somerestrictions on competition may well promote innovationwhile others may not. What is therefore at issue is notmerely the nature of any trade-off between competitiveresults and rapid innovation, but also whether one in factexists. In the early years of this debate, the Kefauvercommittee suggested that these rewards were excessive, sothat patent protection accorded to new pharmaceuticalsshould be more limited. In recent years, as effective patentprotection declined, many have taken the opposite position,and recent legislation has extended the period of patentprotection. (16) B. In Countries Where Patent Rights Are Abridged or Ignored, Innovation Suffers; Where Rights Are Expanded, Innovation Prospers. In Canada, legislation providing for pharmaceutical compulsory licensing was enacted in 1923, although it was not until 1969 that the Canadian Parliament applied the law to drugs imported into the country as well as for those manufactured domestically. The main reason for the change was Parliament's conclusion that prices were too high and that patents were the prime reason. But the actual result was that the robust Canadian pharmaceutical R&D enterprise quickly atrophied. In 1983, the Canadian government noted that the ratio of imports to exports in the pharmaceutical field had increased several fold since 1969. Subsequent legislation, approved in November 1987, provided for a 10-year period of marketing exclusivity for pharmaceutical patentholders. The government also persuaded the pharmaceutical industry to greatly increase its R&D spending, which was a major inducement for the policy turnabout. This was an important first step, but the Canadian system of patent protection still falls short of the standards of other developed countries. (17) In Italy, the government abolished drug patents-before World War II and full patent protection for pharmaceutical inventions was not restored until 1978. During this period, the Italian pharmaceutical industry was concerned more with improving533 processes for.molecules discovered outside Italy rather than with original research. Since 1978, the Italian pharmaceutical industry has grown significantly. Compared to a decade ago, when only one Italian company was among the world's top 100 pharmaceutical firms, now seven Italian-owned companies are among the top 100. Also, R&D investments have increased from 123.1 billion lire in 1978 to 949 billion lire in 1987, and a number of international groups have announced their decisions to establish or expand research centers in Italy. Italy now ranks fifth in the world in discovering new chemical entities used in pharmaceuticals. (18) (19) (20) SUM=AY The major thrust of the majority staff's second report is that pharmaceutical companies can and should be forced to negotiate the prices of their patented products with Medicaid programs to reduce the drug component of Medicaid expenditures. Companies that decline to participate in such negotiations would be denied the opportunity to have their drug products included in the Medicaid formularies. The majority staff argues that this will not hurt Medicaid patients, because therapeutically equivalent drugs can be substituted for any drugs stricken from the formulary. However, there is no consensus that drugs in therapeutic classes such as nonsteroidal antiinflamatory drugs are equivalent. There is, in fact, widespread opposition to \"therapeutic substitution, by the medical profession and also by some hospital pharmacists. And there are many examples of therapeutically inequivalent drugs in the same therapeutic classes that, if exchanged indiscriminately, can produce adverse side effects or suboptimal therapeutic results. Evidence is accumulating that restrictive formularies themselves cause total Medicaid expenditures to rise rather than fall. When patients are denied drug therapies they often end up hospitalized or requiring surgery. Even when formularies cut program costs, they may deny patients needed therapies or require patients to pay for non-fomulary drugs out-of-pocket.534 If companies do agree to negotiate lower prices for drugs that are still on patent,-the patent system itself will be undermined because -the economic advantages of new drug discovery -will be diluted. In countries where patent protection is weakened, drug innovation suffers; where drug patents are protected, innovation prospers. REFERENCES 1. Ballin, J.C. \"Therapeutic substitution 485. 3.

Office of the COMMITTEE ON AGING WASHINGTON, DC 20510-0400 January 23, 1990 Mr. Gerald J. Mossinghoff President Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association 1100 15th Street, NW Washington D.C. 20005 Dear Mr. Mossinghoff: On behalf of the Members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I would like to thank you for sharing with the Committee the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association's (PMA) frank and provocative report, \"America's Pharmaceutical Research Companies: A Cost-Effective Source of Important New Medicines.' It is clear from my review of this document that PMA has labored long and hardto put a favorable \"spin\" on harsh realities. After evaluating the Association's contentions, however, I have concluded that the data in PMA's report serve only to confirm three facts. 1. Most new drugs marketed by manufacturers between 1981 and 1988 had \"little or no potential\" at the time of their introduction to improve on treatment options already available to America's physicians. This fact emerges from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists' review of manufacturers' ownclinical data, and finds support in the judgement of thousands of clinicians participating in hospital and health maintenance organization pharmacy and therapeutics committees across the nation. 2. Marketing of therapeutically duplicative drugs is the norm among drug companies, whether one examines firms selected by PMA as \"major\" firms -- that is, those having an unusually strong commitment to research and development -- or those firmsidentified by the Committee staff. Specifically, Committeestaff found FDA rated 84% of new drugs as offering \"little or no\" potential advantage over current therapies while PMA showed the same is true for 82% of the new drugs marketed by the 25 \"top\" manufacturers most dedicated to research and development. 3. Therapeutically duplicative drug products also account for a majority of the subgroup of new drugs known as \"New MolecularEntities\" (NMEs), regardless of whether one examines PMA's list of \"top\" companies, or the firms identified by Committee staff. Specifically, Committee staff found FDA rated 61% of NMEs asoffering \"little or no potential for therapeutic-gain,\" while the same designation applies tos581 of KENs marketed by PYA'sselected group of-\"top\" companies. Irrespective oftmse-data in PMA's response to the COitteestaff report, PMA has argued that it is \"unfair\" to use Fthlinternal\u00b6 drug evaluations to assess the level of innovation in the industry. I agree that it would be wrong to uncritically accept every one of FDA's judgements in this area. We examined FDA's evaluations at our July hearing because they represent arare objective source of scientific and clinical judgement regarding the therapeutic potential of new drugs. But FDA is not alonedUnfits assessment. In the Committee's November hearing, Ilearned-that similar findings result from the independent deliberati-ons of thousands of physicians and pharmacists who serve on hospital pharmacy and therapeutics (\"P&T\") committees across the nation. ,These \"P&T\" committees shave been established by nearly all of the nation's university teaching hospitals and communityhospitals, and over 40% of-the nation's largest Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Because these committees meet frequently, they are in an excellent position to incorporate in theirdeliberations recent discoveries about new uses for old drugs. After study and debate regarding information submitted by manufacturers, review of the medical literature, and consideration of their members' own clinical experience, these committees too have found that hundreds of drug products -- including many under patent -- are safe and effective alternatives for one another.537 However, it isn't just American physicians, pharmacists, hospitals and HMOs that have found so many new drugs make so little therapeutic contribution. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a list of 'essential drugs., This WHO list is in fact one of the world's most (if not the most) conservative therapeutic formularies. This formulary of \"essential drugs' is so rigorous that only ten new products have been added since 1977, with a similar number deleted. More to the point, only a handful of the several hundred new drugs introduced to the U.S. market during the 1980s even appear on WHO's 'essential drug' list. WHO is yet another informed group that agrees most new drugs add little or nothing to physicians' medical treatment options. Moreover, like the World Health Organization, U.S. hospitals and HMOs use this information to make more informed purchasingdecisions. They do this by offering manufacturers an opportunityto have their product(s) listed on a therapeutic formulary, a list of preferred drug products.- A therapeutic formulary allows theseproviders to throw the bulk of their purchasing power to the lowest bidder among several manufacturers of therapeutically equivalent products. Under this arrangement, preferred products are purchased at tremendous discounts below the manufacturer's published \"Average Wholesale Price.' I have learned from this that a clear-headed market valuation of \"me-too\" drugs is vital to a successful cost-control strategy. I raise these issues not to embarrass the industry but to laythe groundwork for a fundamental reappraisal of the Government'scost-containment strategy for prescription drugs. These facts provide a conceptual yardstick for evaluating the claim that research and development costs justify skyrocketing drug prices. I want policymakers to be aware that while new drug prices are pegged an average of 49% above the price of drugs they replace, the FDA finds 60 to 00 percent of them offer little or no therapeutic advantage over existing products. I want my colleagues in the Congress and in the States to see what first rate health care providers have been able to do to reduce drug prices once they took off their blinders. When these facts are known, Ibelieve Congress will authorize more Government agencies to negotiate fair prices -- instead of accepting industry's askingprice -- for the high-priced \"me-too\" drugs on the market today. As you can see, I am not opposed to the production of \"me-too\" drugs. I am simply opposed to the idea that American citizens must pay high prices for them. As a result of the Committee'shearings, and after reviewing PMA's independent confirmation ofthese data, I am more convinced than ever that now is the time forfinancially-strapped State Medicaid programs to use our knowledge of therapeutic duplication to achieve drug price discounts, the way hospitals-and HMOs do. I will be introducing legislation to accomplish this goal in the second session of the 101st Congress, and invite the Association's comments on this proposal as itdevelops. This proposal is identified as 'Option 2- in the attached pre-publication version of the second Committee staffreport. Please let me know PMA's reaction to this proposal, and to the staff report itself. Just yesterday, I received PMA's response to our second draft staff report and have not had a chance to thoroughly review it. I would say, however, that while the concerns you raise may well apply to formulary systems currently in place in some State Medicaid programs, these issues do not apply to legislation that I am considering. More thorough review of your response is underway. Once again, thank you for your interest in the Committee's study of prescription drug prices. I look forward to working with you as discussions proceed on my legislative proposal.

Sections 202 and 203 of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-360 (\"MCCA\"), establishes an outpatient drug program covering catastrophic expenses for prescription drugs and insulin incurred by those persons electing Part B coverage under Medicare. Beginning on January 2, 1990, coverage includes home intravenous drug-, and extends coverage of immunosuppressive drug therapy. The program expands on January 1, 1991, to include all legend drugs, biologicals, and insulin, as now described in Section 1861(t) of the Social Security Act. Purnose Or this report Section 1834(c)(8) of the Social Security Act, as enacted by Section 202(b)(4) of MCCA, requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services report to Congress on changes in manufacturers, prices and pharmacists' charges for covered outpatient drugs and on the use of covered outpatient drugs by individuals entitled to the benefit. The report is to include: \"... a co parison of the increases in prices and charges for covered outpatient drugs during each 6 month period (beginning with January 1987) with the semi-annual average increase in such prices and charges during the 6 years beginning with 1981.\" Although program data will provide much of the information needed to prepare subsequent reports in this series, at present there are no such data. Consequently, this initial report is based primarily upon the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BIS). The PPI and CPI are readily available sources of information on changes in prices at both the manufacturer and the retailer levels. These indices were chosen as the basis for assessing change in manufacturers' prices and pharmacists' charges over tine because they provide a consistent and reasonably reliable indication of price changes in similar market baskets of goods and services at regular intervals. OVZRVIZW OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY Health and druc exnenditures Although spending for prescription drugs has increased over time, it has done so only at the pace of the economy in general, and sore slowly than has total National health expenditures. An estimated $34 billion was spent in the United States during 1987 for prescription and nonprescription drugs and medical sundries, an increase averaging 8.9 percent per year from the $5 billion spent in 1965. In terms of the overall economy, this amount is relatively unchanged: spending for drugs and sundries ranged between 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent of the gross national product (GNP) from 1965 through 1987. However, growth in expenditure for drugs and sundries has been much slower than that for other kinds of health care, and that expenditure has fallen as a proportion of total national health expenditures, from 12.4 percent in 1965 to 6 8 percent in 1987. In particular, national expenditures for hospital care and physician services have increased much more rapidly during the past two decades than expenditures for drugs and sundries have. Develogment and manufacture of prescription druZs Manufacturers of prescription drugs in the United States accounted for $37.1 billion in pharmaceutical shipments in 1988, an amount that is projected to grow by 2.8 percent in 1989 before inflation (International Trade Administration, 1989). Of the 1988 amount, $3.8 billion was exported; an additional $3.6 .billion was imported. Thus, shipments destined for domestic consumption amounted to about $36.9 billion.545 The process by which a prescription drug is brought tomarket is lengthy. The drug may be discovered, isolated, orsynthesized through research and development efforts ofresearchers at pharmaceutical companies or in government anduniversity settings. Once -an-active compound has been found, thedrug must be formulated into a stable and usable dosage form.Clinical trials in animals and humans are then required by theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) as a condition for approval ofa New Drug Application (NDA). In 1987, an estimated $5.4 billion was spent by U.S.pharmaceutical companies on research and development, an annualinvestment that has doubled every 5 years since 1970(Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, 1988). This year,pharmaceutical companies are expected to spend more on researchand development than the National Institutes of Health spends onall biomedical research. Single source and multiple source drue products For thepurposes of the MCCA, it is useful to consider two types ofprescription products. Single source drugs are those for which there is nocompetitor. To manufacture and market a prescription drug product a company must obtain a New Drug Application (NDA). Thedrug discovery and development process is quite expensive,requiring investment of substantial resources in basic research,manufacturing process engineering, and clinical trials to obtainNDA approval .To encourage innovation, the Federal Governmentgrants exclusive marketing rights (i.e., patents) for a limitedperiod of time to companies successful in discovering andobtaining NDA's for new chemical entities. During this period ofexclusivity, when the drug is available only from one company,the drug is called a single source drug. After the patent on a drug entity has expired, othermanufacturers may apply for and receive FDA approval to marketthe drug. Once these manufacturers bring additional products tothe market, the drug is generally referred to as a multiplesource drug. Section 1834(c) (9) of the Social Security Actdefines a multiple source drug as -an outpatient drug for whichthere are 2 or more drug products which are rated astherapeutically equivalent according to the Food and DrugAdministration's most recent publication of 'Approved DrugProducts with Therapeutic Equiva v dvaluations,' \"commonlyreferred to as the FDA -Orange Book.\" The original single sourceproduct is usually referred to-assther-\"originator\" product, todistinguish it from all other products-for the drug entity. Many of the companies marketing generic .-multiple sourcedrug products are merely-distributors-or labulers and not-theactual manufacturer of the. drug product. The distributor orlabeler of a drug product does not-have to hawe an NDA to-marketthe product as long as the actual manufacturer-of the company'sproduct holds such an NDA. There are far more distributors orlabelers marketing some drugs than there are NDA holders listedin the Orange Book. For example, doxepin 25g. capsules have 5NDA holders listed in the Orange Book whileLone drug pricedatabase, NDA holders actively mmret- a drug-product under theirown name. For example, 6 of the 15 NDA holders for furosemide40mg. tablets listed in the Orange Book fild not have a marketeddrug product listed in GBRG (Appendix B) I The Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association has estimatedthe cost of bringing a new chemical entity (NCE) to market to be$125 million dollars (Wiggins, 1987). 2 Although the Orange Book serves-as a useful reference as towhich holders of NDAs produce products considered by the FDA to-betherapeutically equivalent, it does not indicate which marketeddrug products of drug labelers and distributors are considered bythe FDA to be therapeutically equivalent.546 Whether a drug is a multiple source or single source drug tends to influence the price at which the drug is marketed. Since marketers of \"non-originator\" or 'generic\" products do not incur all the research and development and marketing approval costs associated with bringing a new drug to market, their costs for entry into the market are lower than those incurred by the marketer of the originator product. Also, competition between companies marketing a drug entity tends to affect prices at which the drug can be bought and sold. As a result of these factors, many multiple source drugs undergo price decreases in the first year or two after they go off patent. Number of arescrintion drugs marketed The precise number of prescription drug products on the market in the United States is not easily determined. Computerized databases (Nedi-Span, Red Book, and Blue Book) use an item's national drug code (NDC) number (pr other unique identifier) to index and sort drug products .Although these drug databases claim to contain between 100,000 and 120,000 items, they typically include over-the-counter products, diagnostics, chemicals, pharmaceutical adjuvants, antiseptics and disinfectants, veterinary products, and soaps and sunscreens. After removal of all of the above mentioned items, the remaining database consists of legend (prescription only) pharmaceuticals for oral, topical, or injectable use in humans. An estimate of the total number of prescription products on the market, made during January 1989 using the Naster Drug Database (NDDB) maintained by Medi-Span, Inc., shows the differences that can occur when one uses various definitions of drug products. When considering the number of prescription products (as defined above) with unique NDC numbers (i.e., drug entity, dosage form, strength, manufacturer or labeler, and package size) more than 48,500 items were found. Elimination of package size in counting the number of prescription products reduced the count to a number in excess of 30,000. When only drug entity, dosage form, and strength were considered (irrespective of the number of manufacturers or labelers), there are only about 7,200 different types of prescription products on the market. Elimination of product strength from consideration when counting the number of prescription products further reduced that number to just over 4,200 drug entities in various dosage forms. Finally, there were 2,594 prescription drug entities when counted based only upon the drug for chemical) ingredients contained in the product (Figure A). Acoutiition of ur-scrintion drug. hv retail uharsaCis There are several alternative channels by which precription drug products reach the retail market. o A majority of the large pharmaceutical companies sell their drug products to pharmacies through drug wholesalers. Drug wholesalers provide efficient distribution of, and access. to, prescription drugs for many of the nation's retail pharmacies. o A number of larger chain pharmacy operations have established their own warehousing and distribution channels. These chains usually purchase drug products in large quantities on contract. The product is then shipped from the manufacturer or distributor directly to the chain's warehouse and is, in turn, sent to the retail chain pharmacy by the chain's own distribution system. o A few of the major pharmaceutical companies and many generic pharmaceutical companies sell drug products direct to retail pharmacies. This process is not devoid of pitfalls, however. Purchases of drug products direct from the manufacturer may require more administrative and handling costs. In addition, delivery of direct orders for drug products usually take longer than delivery from wholesalers. Also, the pharmacy is often forced to place larger orders when purchasing direct, which may result in increased inventory carrying costs. A single NDC represents a specific drug entity, domage form, strength, package size, and product manufacturer or labeler.547 a Several retail cooperative or buying groups exist in thecurrent retail prescription marketjto assist independent andsmall chain pharmacies in competing with the purchasingpower of large chain, hospital, HMO, and mail order pharmacyoperations. These retail buying groups often work withexisting wholesalers to administer their group purchasingprograms. However, in many cases the independent buyinggroups have not been given the same drug product prices asthe other large purchasers mentioned above. Although the acquisition price of a pharmaceutical productsis very important when choosing among the distribution channelsmentioned above, the pharmacy also considers a number ofnon-price factors that may significantly affect the quality ofboth the pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical servicesprovided to beneficiaries. Among these factors are: o product availability (in stock/out-of-stock track record;ability of the supplier to meet product demand); o product acceptability (consistentcolor size, and shape;inclusion in the FDA Orange Book as. an 4A\" rated item; and a low rate of product recalls); o return goods policies of both the wholesaler and the productmanufacturer or distributor; o breadth of product line from the same source (both in termsof a drug entity's strengths and dosage forms and in termsof the number of drug entities in the line); o product liability coverage by the manufacturer ordistributor when the product is properly dispensed; and o the manufacturers's cooperation with preferred channels ofdistribution such as prime vendor wholesalers, retail orhospital buying groups, or direct sales to a warehousing chain. The retail orescriotion dollar By one count, outpatientcommunity pharmacy prescriptions in 1986 accounted for $18.9billion in sales, averaging $14.36 each (American Druggist, 1987). By this same count, more than 1.5 billion prescriptions were dispensed to the population as a whole, an average of 6.5per capita. The prescription sales dollar is typically divided among thethree components of the drug distribution system: the pharmacy,the wholesaler, and the manufacturer. In 1986, for example, onereport allocated 32.2 percent of the 1986 prescription dollar tothe pharmacy, SB. percent to the wholesaler, and 62.8 percent tothe manufacturer (Figure B) (Eli Lilly and Company, 1988). The retail pharmacy share of prescription sales coverssalaries, rent, and other expenses. Almost half of that sharegoes into salaries; another third went for other types ofexpenses (Table 1 and Figure C). The remainder was split fairlyevenly between rent and profit. The average retail pharmacy'snet before-tax profit in 1986 was 2.7 percent of gross sales. Production and research account for nearly half of themanufacturer's share of the retail dollar. The cost of makingthe drug product accounts for about 36 percent of the revenuemanufacturers receive or about 24 percent of the total retailprescription charge (Table 1 and Figure 0). Manufacturers'research and development costs consume 11 percent of their totalrevenue and about 7 percent of the retail prescription charge.Marketing expenses account for about 20 percent of themanufacturers' revenue and about 13 percent of the totalprescription charge. Profit (retained earnings and dividendsafter taxes) accounts for 15 percent of manufacturers' revenuesand 9-to-10 percent of the total prescription charge. Retailer and manufacturer profit combined consumes 12percent of the total retail prescription charge. Based on the average prescription charge Of $14.36 in 1986, retail profitamounted to about $0.39 per prescription, and manufacturers'profit was approximately $1.35 per prescription. Thus, about$1.74 of the $14.36 average prescription charge for 1986represented profit.548 PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION, 1981-1987 The producer price index The producer price index (PPI), first published in 1902, is one of the oldest statistical series published by the U.S. Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics; 1984). The PPI is designed to measure the change over time in the prices received in commercial transactions by manufacturers or producers of various goods. The Bureau of Labor Statistics attempts to base the PPI on actual transaction prices. Companies are requested to report prices less all discounts, allowances, rebates, free deals, etc., so that the resulting net price is the actual selling price of the product being surveyed. The validity of the PPI, then, is dependent largely upon the accuracy with which manufacturers in a given industry report true transaction prices for their products. One limitation of the PPI particularly relevant to the pharmaceutical industry is the difficulty in accounting for the rapid introduction of new products and any improved quality they may deliver (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989). New chemical entities or improved dosage forms introduced into the retail prescription market may provide a significant therapeutic advance over existing products. Usually, new patent-protected products cost more than existing products on the market, partly reflecting that advance. However, the addition of these new products to the PPI will result in a measured price increase, rather than a reflection of the improved quality or technological advance represented by the new products, resulting in an upward bias of unknown magnitude to price inflation as measured 1by the PPI. Any price index incorporates some level of aggregation, and the PPI is no exception. The PPI series includes separate price measures for some three dozen therapeutic categories of drug products, as well as a composite index for all prescription drugs. Producer price inflation General trends in manufacturers' prices for drug products can be observed by reviewing changes over time in the PPI for prescription drugs. A summary of these changes for several therapeutic categories of prescription drugs are summarized in Table 2. The PPI for all prescription products grew 78.3 percent between 1981 and 1986, averaging 10.1 percent per year. In recent years, growth has fallen below the longer-term average (Figure E): the 1986-87 phange was 9.6 percent and that between 1987 and 1988 was 7.9 percent. Considerable differences exist among price inflation for specific therapeutic categories. Prices of broad spectrum penicillins and anticoagulants increased only 14.5% and 16.6%, respectively, between 1981 and 1986 (Figure F). This rate of change was lower than the 28-percent general rate of inflation (measured by the consumer price index for all consumer items), and considerably below the 78-percent growth in the aggregate PPI for prescription drugs. The price of antiarthritics also increased at a rate (30.8 percent) similar to the overall rate ofinflation. In contrast, prices in five of the therapeutic categories increased between 1981 and 1986 more than four times the general price increase in the economy (Figure G). Cancer therapy drug prices grew 159.3 percent at the producer level, dermatologicals experienced inflation of 155.4 percent, sedative prices rose 132.8 percent, central nervous system (0s) stimulant prices rose 129.6 percent, and psychotherapeutic prices grew 113.2 percent. In addition, price levels for analgesics grew at a 6-year rate of 105.3 percent, almost four times the general level of price inflation. Reasons for producer price arowth The influence of single source and multiple source drugs and new chemical entities may provide a partial explanation of the difference in observed inflation rates across the various therapeutic categories. Those categories experiencing relatively low inflation (broad spectrum penicillins, for example, or anticoagulants) contain a large number of off-patent or multiple source drugs. Similarly, ibuprofen, a major antiarthritic drug, went off-patent during the period under consideration, potentially lowering the growth of prices in that category. Other therapeutic categories may have experienced more rapid price growth because of the introduction of new chemical entities carrying higher price tags due to embodied improvements in quality or effectiveness.549 Not all producer price inflation can be attributed todevelopment costs, however. Testimony before the HouseSubcommittee on Health and the Environment resulted in a staffreport in which the following major findings appeared: o Twenty-two of the 24 companies responding to the Housesurvey had increases in revenues from price changes thatwere greater than increases in expenditures for research anddevelopment (R&D) for the period 1982-1986. o Marketing and detail staff expenditures were greater thanR&D expenditures during the same period. o Prices charged in the United States arecconsistently higherthan those charged in foreign countries for the sam drug. CONSUMER PRICES FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS The consumer price index The consumer price index (CPI), ameasure of the average change in retail prices paid by consumersfor a fixed market basket of goods and services, is widely usedas a measure of inflation in the consumer economy. The all urbanindex (CPI-U) is a market basket weighted to represent the buyinghabits of about 80 percent of the non-institutional population ofthe United States (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1984). Unlessotherwise noted, all CPI values used in this report are data fromthe CPI-U, unadjusted for seasonal variation. The CPI for all items is based on a sample of prices forfood, clothing, shelter and fuels, transportation, medicalservices, and the other goods and services that people buy fordaily living. Price change is measured by gathering prices onessentially the same market basket of goods and services atregular intervals and comparing such prices with an earlier baseperiod. In this way, the CPI is not an exact measure of pricechange; as with the PPI, non-price escalation of the CPI mayoccur due to changes in technology or significant increases inproduct or service quality. Even though the CPI is an indicator of retail prices, itdoes not reflect retailer actions alone. In the pharmaceuticalmarket, for example, the pharmacy's acquisition cost frommanufacturers and wholesalers typically represents 67% to 75* ofthe total retail prescription price. Therefore, to isolate thechange in retail prices contributed by the retailer requiresfirst that one subtract any increase in the cost of goods sold. As with the PPI, there are subcategories for the CPI as wellas aggregate indexes. At the most aggregate level, the CPI forall items (housing, food, clothing, medical care, etc.) is ameasure of economy-wide price change. A CPI series for allmedical care items is routinely reported by 3Sls and is furtherdivided into two major subdivisions: -medical \"non-prescription end of 1986, the BLS alsomaintained a CPI series for each of six specific therapeuticcategory groupings of prescription products. It should be noted that the CPI for prescription drugs(CPI-Rx) reflects retail prices for prescriptions sold through.community pharmacies. Although the PPI for prescription drugsreflects manufacturers' prices to such retailers, the PPI alsoencompasses manufacturers' prices to other classes of trade suchas hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and mail servicepharmacies, none of which are included in thd CPI. consumer once ir'fl for orangs in retail prices for prescription drugs over tie Mare refletetd inthe CPI-Rx. This component increased 79 4 percent increasebetween 1981 and 1986 (Table 3), an average annual rate of 10.2percent. As was the case for the PPI, the CPI-Rx grew moreslowly than that average during 1987 and 1988 (Figure H): theinflation rates posted were 8.0 percent and 7.8 percent,respectively.550 Prescription drug prices at the retail level have grown more rapidly than the general rate of inflation, but at about the same rate as drug prices at the producer level (Figures I and J). In contrast to the 10.2 percent average growth of drug prices between 1981 and 1986, the CPI for all items experienced a rate of 4.2 percent; annual growth in 1987 and-in 1988 was 4.4 percent. Indeed, the CPI-Rx has risen more rapidly since 1980 than any other component of the CPI for medical care (Figure K). On the other hand, the nearly parallel increase in theprescription drug components of the PPI and the CPI is an indication that manufacturers' drug product prices are a major factor affecting growth retail prescription prices. The current situation, in which prescription drug priceinflation outpaces that of consumer goods and services in general, has not always been the case; between 1970 and 1980, theopposite was true. In fact, the CPI-Rx actually fell in 1972 and again in 1973 (Figure L). Other measures of retail costs The CPI-Rx is not the only measure of retail prices. For example, Eli Lilly and Company have surveyed retail pharmacies for many years; between 1981 and 1986, their average prescription price grew from $8.80 to $14.36, an aggregate increase of 63.2 percent (Eli Lilly and Company, 1988), compared to the 79.4 percent increase posted for the CPI-Rx. The Lilly price increased 7.0 percent between 1986 and 1987, compared to 8.0 percent for the CPI-Rx. Some of the difference between the two rates of inflation can be attributed to the composition of the index: the CPI-Rx holds fixed the mix of drugs to be priced, while the Lilly index reflects the average of all drugs sold, incorporating changes in price and mix. It is also instructive to compare the growth in the retail portion of prescription prices with the manufacturers' share ofthat price. The gross margin per prescription in independent pharmacies grew from $3.02 in 1981 to $4.62 in 1986, an increase of 53.0 percent over the 6-year period. Thus, the rate of increase in pharmacists' charges was about one-third less than the rate of increase in manufacturers' prices. -The 1987 averagegross margin was $4.93, 6.7 percent higher than in 1986, compared to an increase of 7.9 percent in the PPI. Over the last thirty yeare, there has been a slight but steady decline in net pre-tax profit as a percent of sales, beginning at about 5.5 percent in 1960 end reaching 3.3 percent in 1987. USE OF OUTPATIENT DRUGS BY THE AGED-POPULATION Hard data on use of drugs by the Medicare population are notcurrently available. Fragmentary evidence on use by subgroups of the population was being compiled at the time this report was. prepared, and will be submitted to Congress under separate cover. Data on -drug mentions\" may shed some light on use patterns by the aged population, however. The National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI) provides an estimate of the types and number of drugs mentioned during office-based physician visits (INS Amsrica, 1989); a \"drug mention' can be a prescription, provision of a free sample, a hospital order, and so on, making it difficult to isolate prescription activity alone. However, the patterns of drug mentions can provide clues to use of drugs by the aged population. The first piece of useful information provided by the drug mention data is that use of prescription drugs is confined principally to relatively few entities (Table 4 and Figure N). Drug mentions for the elderly in 1988 included almost 2,500different drug entities and about 30,000 unique drug products(i.e., drug entity, dosage form, strength, and labeler or manufacturer). However, the top 25 drug entities accounted for 28.8 percent of all drug mentions and the top 100 drug entities included 56.2 percent of all drug mentions. The top 250 drug entities were responsible for 75.9 percent of all drug mentions and the top 500 were responsible for 88.5 percent of all drug mentions. The drug therapy categories most commonly mentioned for the elderly during physician office visits were cardiovasculars (21.8 percent of all mentions), systemic anti-infectives (9.7 percent), diuretics (8.6 percent), analgesics (6.6 percent), and hormones (5.7 percent) (Table 5).551 SUMMARY Between 1981 and 1986, both producer and retail prescriptiondrug prices increased more than twice as fast as consumer pricesin general. However, since 1987, the gap between drug inflation and general inflation has narrowed. More than two thirds of the retail price of prescription drugs goes to pay for the prices of the drug products obtained from manufacturers or wholesalers. This may explain the close relationship seen in the level of increase in prescription drug prices at the manufacturer level and pharmacists' charges for prescription drug at the retail level.,., REFERENCES American Druggist: Annual Rx study.

Kotzan, Ph.D. Professor & Head Department of Pharmacy Care Administration College of Pharmacy University of Georgia Matthew Perri 111, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Department of Pharmacy Care Administration College of Pharmacy University of Georgia Alan P. Wolfgang, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Department of Pharmacy Care Administration College of Pharmacy University of Georgia 31-352 0 -90 -19574 INTRODUCTION Examination of various strategies designed to contain health care costs, including those for ethical pharmaceutical products, is an area of much interest to providers, fiscal intermediaries and other third party payors, and consumers alike. Interest in the evaluation of those strategies will undoubtedly grow in the future with rapidly escalating costs for medical services. Expenditures for personal health care topped 435 billion dollars in 1987 and are projected to increase to almost 1.4 trillion dollars in the year 20001. As ethical pharmaceuticals play an ever increasing role in patient care, personal expenditures for pharmaceuticals and devices are projected to increase from 33 billion dollars in 1987 to 103 billion dollars in 20001. Estimating pharmaceutical expenditures accurately may be difficult due to the influence of, for example, new product introductions, biotechnology research and development, and innovations in pharmaceutical marketing such as direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising. These and other factors will likely have unpredictable effects on drug use2 It is predictable, however, that new drug therapies will command premium prices and that the cost of drug therapies will continue to increase. One of the available strategies to contain future expenditures for pharmaceuticals is to persuade physicians to prescribe the most cost effective product(s) for a given condition by providing physicians with accurate drug cost information. An 'information' strategy such as this has appeal but may not be auccesmful since it is generally accepted that physicians are poorly informed about the cost of the pharmaceuticals they prescribe. In general physicians have demonstrated poor overall accuracy for predicting prices for prescriptions3.They tend to greatly overestimate the prices of the less expensive legend drugs and greatly underestimate the more expensive products. This study also provided evidence that physicians who claim they are confident about prescription costs are generally no better estimators of prices than those physicians who are lese confident. Further, medical residents who indicated that they relied on price information from pharmacists were more accurate estimators of prescription prices than were practicing physicians who relied on information from manufacturers' representatives. This implies that the source of price information may also be a factor relating to the accuracy of price predictions by physicians. If an information strategy for reducing prescription expenditures is to be effective, physicians should perceive significant need for price575 iniormation and be willing to alter their prescription writing habits in response to drug cost information. Physicians appear to be increasingly more receptive to the idea of incorporating price information into the decision process. In a study reported in 1954, physicians expressed little interest in considering price in the prescription decision process4 4. oever, more recent evidence suggests that physicians will accept and use price information in a managed health care environment. In one study, providing drug price information to physicians in a managed care setting in a bulletin or newsletter format has been shown to reduce overall costs by aS much as 30t.5 The primary objective of'this investigation was to develop an understanding of how an 'information' strategy would be accepted by physicians. To accomplish this objective we examined several basic questions. First, do physicians believe there is a need for accurate drug cost information and are they willing to use this information in prescribing decisions if it is provided? Next, what sources do physicians 9 currently use for drug cost information and how satisfied are they with these sources? Lastly, are physicians willing-to pay for drug cost information? MIETHlODOLCY A preliminary questionnaire was developed from an initial pool of items developed by the investigators. This was informally pretested on a small group of physicians resulting in some minor changes in phraseology. The final version of the instrument (Appendix A) contained three -sections, The first section was a cover letter identifying the sponsor, voluntary nature and purpose of the study, The second section displayed a graph and tabular data of actual average prescription prices for the most frequently prescribed quantities of the top seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, The drug products included in the graph were selected based on dollar volume, The prices and quantities presented to the physicians ware derived from a Medicaid database containing over 700,000 prescription charges for a one month period, The final section of the questionnaire contained the attitudinal items and several questions designed to assess physician's sources of and satisfaction with drug price information and to assess physician demographics, The three page questionnaire was printed, individually signed by one investigator and folded to fit into a first class business envelope. The instrument was designed so that after completion it could be easily re-folded exposing a business reply mail return address,' 576 Two copies of a current mailing list composed of a random sample of 1,344 Georgia physicians were purchased commercially, facilitating an initial mailing and one follow-up ten days later. Surveys that vere coopleted and returned were reduced into machine readable form, verified, uploaded to a central computer system and analyzed with the Statistical Analysis System6 RESULTS The overall response rate to the survey was 22.6% with a total of 304 usable questionnaires being received. Two-thirds of the responding physicians reported that they practiced in A group practice setting. About one half (56.3%) had been in practice less than fifteen years and 43.8% were in practice for fifteen years or greater. The responding physicians were almost evenly divided between primary care (53.1%) and specialty (46.9%) practice. Perceived Need for Drug Price Information Physicians' responses to individual survey items indicated that there was significant need for drug cost information in medical practice. This is evidenced by the 82% of the physicians that indicated they needed more drug cost information than they currently received. Host of the responding physicias agreed that patients are concerned sbout drug costs (85%) and expect physicians to know about drug cost information (57%). Further, 59% of the respondents agreed that cost was a factor in patient compl iance. Use of Drug Price Information Eighty-two percent of the physicians agreed that if they did know more about drug cost they, could save their patients money on prescription drugs and 68t agreed that they would use drug cost information if it were more accessible. A total of 82% of the physicians agreed that health care administrators are concerned about drug prices. Eighty-seven percent of responding physicians indicated that they frequently use drug cost information in making prescribing decisions, however, 62% indicated that they believed cost should not be a consideration when choosing a drug therapy. Drug Price Bulletin A large majority of the respondents (90%) agreed that the newsletter concept was a good idea for providing physicians with drug cost577 information. However, only 46% indicated they would be willing to pay for information in this format. Physicians ' willingness to pay for the service on an annual basis vas categoried .into $0, $0-S30. $31-$50, $51-$70, and aore than $70. Only a few respondents indicated that they were willing to pay sore than $30 per year for the service and, therefore, the item was dichotomized into those who expressed a willingness to pay something (46%) versus those who expressed no interest -in paying for the service (54%). Sources of Information and Satisfaction Figures 1 and 2 show that physicians reported that they seek price information most frequently from patients, followed by pharmacists, pharmaceutical representatives, and lastly fellow medical practitioners. The survey results also indicated that physicians were most satisfied with the information received from patients and pharmaciata and less satisfied with the information received from fellow practitioners and pharmaceutical representatives. Physician Characteristics and Willingnesa to Pay The results of the categorical analysis are represented in Table 1. This analysis produces a table similar to analysis of variance procedures with reported Chi Square values in place of the customary F ratios. The results indicated a significant relationship between the willingness to pay for the price information and the two variables years in practice and patient expectations. The interaction between the years in practice variable and the patient expectation.variable proved not to be significant. No-relationship was noted between willingness to pay for the prescription pricealnformation and physician specialty. The individual effects of years in practice and patient expectations are reported in Figures 3 and 4. Those physicians who believed patients expect them to be knowledgeable about prescription prices were acre willing to pay for the service. Also, those younger physicians who had bean in practice for less than 15 years were more willing to pay. DISCUSSION Perceived Need for Drug Price Information The results of this survey supported previous findings which indicated that physicians are poorly informed regarding prescription price information.. Few medical practitioners stated that accurate drug price information was readily svailable to the. in their practices. Physicians reported that they tend to rely upon and are satisfied with drug price _-_ I -- ------ --- -------578 information gathered from patients. However, drug price information received from patients should be interpreted cautiously. The information received from patient sources may be anecdotal, imprecise, or simply incorrect. Further, drug price information provided by patients cannot easily be organized in a manner which would allow the practitioner to compare similar products within a single therapeutic category. The results of the survey also provided evidence to support a relationship between patients expecting their physician to be aware of drug price information and physicians willingness to pay for drug price information. Younger physicians also were found to be significantly more willing to pay something for a drug price information bulletin. This could be due to heightened sensitivity to patient expectations, since younger physicians would be at a stage in their career when they would be building a practice. Or, perhaps this is simply an artifact of society's recent movement toward cost containment in health care. Feasibility of a Drug Price Bulletin Based on the results of this study, an informational cost containment strategy for pharmaceuticals which relies upon voluntary subscriptions by physicians for drug price information should presently be approached cautiously. Physicians indicate they need accurate drug price information and that they will incorporate this into their decision process and prescription writing habits, providing an incentive to pursue this concept further. However, it was noted that many physicians were simply not willing to pay for this type of an information service. If it is assumed that willingness to pay for a service such as this is an indicator of perceived worth, these results indicate a general reluctance to support a drug price information service. However, as was noted above, physicians who are more sensitive to patient expectations, for example, younger physicians, are willing to pay for a drug price bulletin. Considering recent trends in health care consumerism, and innovative patient behaviors such as 'doctor shopping' where patients actively seek out a practitioner that will accommodate their needs and desires in a physician, the perceived worth of a drug price information should increase. The question still remains as to whether providing this information to physicians will have any impact on their prescription writing habits. A drug price information bulletin may be very effective in containing costs in managed care settings where savings can result in economic incentive for the physician. But what about fee-for-service physicians in private practice? The incentive for these professionals may be minimized because patient complaints may be deferred (for example, topharmacists) and probably will not be directly assigned to the responsibility of the prescriber. It seems that a drug price information service will most effectively impact on physician prescribing habits in situations which contain incentives for cost containment For example risk ahariog contracts between physician and managed health care provider groups might provide such an incentive. Arrangements such as these could limit prescription expense by passing a portion of the savings back to the physician which, in turn, would make price information necessary to attain financial objectives. Physicians do perceive the need for drug price information, and realize that many patients may want them to be knowledgeable about prescription prices. However, is a general knowledge acceptable or do patients want physicians to be able to asks specific price comparisons? Managed care and other cost containment strategies are on the rise. This certainly seems. to provide an incentive for physicians to learn about drug prices. Fee for service physicians may currently have less incentive to be well informed about drug prices, however, as the increasingly cost conscious consumer begins to demand prescription price sensitivity from the physician, this too may change. 'LIMITATIONS This study was limited byi the self reported nature of the data and the limited exposure physicians have to drug price information. Further the response rate was only approximately 23%, indicating that non-response bias could be a significant factor in this investigation. The results obtained could be biased since physicians which are more concerned about drug prices might be more likely to respond to a survey such as this. The low response rate and potential for bias are of great concern, however, this response rate should be sufficient to provide insight into this issue.580 Table 1.

PMA recognizes the difficult situation you presently confront in seeking to deal with the state's current budgetary shortfall, while providing quality health care to the state's Medicaid patients. However, we wish to raise a number of concerns about recent cost-containment actions and proposals affecting Medicaid pharmacy services which are being implemented by Dr. Harder, Secretary of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. These proposalo include (1) the establishment of a very restricted drug formularg, (2) the adoption of state MACs on various drug products, and (3) the implementation of competitive bidding to limit drug coverage to selected products within a drug class. PMA believes that these proposals represent unsound cost- containment policies that will have adverse consequences on patient care and on the overall operation of an extremely cost- effective pharmacy program. We have notified Secretary Harder of our concerns regarding these measures and have received an unsatisfactory response to date (see enclosed correspondence). In addition to the adverse medical and economic consequences of these proposals, we believe there are serious legal issues specifically associated with the competitive bid/rebate program. Our analysis points to a number of important questions regarding the legal basis of this program: 1. What is the state's statutory authority for instituting the competitive bid/rebate program? 2. What is the state's statutory authority for applying the competitive bid/rebate program to sole-source pharmaceutical products?617 -2- 3. What is the state's position on the applicability of the federal Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Act to payments made under the competitive bid/rebate program? This Act makes it a crime to give or receive rebates for Medicaid-reimbursable items, 42 U.S.C.A. Section 1395nn(b). This question is currently being reviewed by the federal Health Care Financing Administration. 4. Does the state's acceptance of rebates violate the Robinson-Patman Act's prohibition against knowingly inducing or receiving discriminatory prices, 15 U.S.C. 13(f)? s. Was the Kansas Medical Care Advisory Committee consulted on formulary changes and implementation of the competitive bid/rebate program as required by 42 C.F.R. Section 431.12? 6. Would individual recipients be given prior notice and opportunity for a hearing before their benefits were reduced through implementation of the competitive bid/rebate program? Given the major importance of these questions to both Medicaid patients and providers, we respectfully request that you direct the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services-to cease a.implementation of the competitive bid/rebate program until the State addresses these significant legal issues.

Kansas 66601 MAR 988 OFFICE OF IHEFebruary 29, 1988 SECRETARY Governor Mike Hayden State Capitol Topeka, Kansas 66612 Dear Governor: On behalf of my client, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, I wish to share with you that Association's viewon a problem with a proposed action by the Department of Socialand Rehabilitation Services. Member companies of PMA and myself have already discussedthis issue with Winston Barton. We appreciate the time andattention he gave us. We also appreciate the forthright manner of Mr. Barton in expressing his intentions and plan of action.The Secretary was kind enough to tell us he would be discussingthis issue with you this week and I would like to share myclient's position. The Secretary has told us he plans to utilize a bid/rebateprogram that he would utilize in the future on selectedsingle-source prescription drugs. Mr. Barton told me that his department intends in thefuture to ask pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit 'bids\" onselected prescription products. The medical services staff of SRS believes that by bidding for a single prescription drug, the department would save thestate Medicaid funds. Single-source pharmaceuticals are drugs for whichpharmaceutical manufacturers hold patents. On an industry average only about one of every ten thousand chemical compounds is actually ever introduced as a new product. It generally takes from seven to ten years after discovery of new compounds for a company to gain approval by the Federal Food and DrugAdministration to market the new products and this research anddevelopment time averages in cost from $91-100 million.619 Secondly, each of these pharmaceutical drugs is unique and is designed for different treatment regimens. It is extremely difficult to find drugs that are so similar in nature and treatment regimens as to be able to substitute these drugs appropriately. Last year the medical services division of SRS attempted to try this procedure with a group of anti-ulcer drugs, commonly referred to as H-2 antagonists. The Department sought bids from the manufacturers of these prescription drugs but received none. The Department then arbitrarily picked a single anti-ulcer drug and delisted other H-2 antagonists from the formula list. The cost savings from this move never occurred. In fact, the Department is now paying more for the single anti-ulcer drug than it was paying previously when three different anti-ulcer drugs were available. In addition, the Department's Drug Utilization Review Committee (which is made up of Kansas physicians, pharmacists, and nurses) has recommended that these anti-ulcer drugs be reinstated to the formula list of Medicaid. The Department's Special Consultant in Pharmacology also recommended that this action be reversed and the drugs restored to the formula list. Despite these recomendations and other comments from well-known Kansas physicians, the medical staff has refused to do so. During the past year, representatives of the manufacturers pharmaceutical association companies have been meeting with the staff of SRS and have offered to work in establishing treatment regimens and procedures to see that certain overdosages and overprescribing could be eliminated. Despite offers of help from the companies, the Department has refused to cooperate to help in these cost-cutting areas. I cannot speak of course for every individual member of the 120 pharmaceutical research manufacturing firms that compose the membership of PMA, but I suspect if Secretary Barton does seek bids for these types of pharmaceutical products in the future he will probably receive none. The reason for this lack of response is that each company has a tremendous amount of research and development costs wrapped up in these particular drugs. The active life of a prescription pharmaceutical usually only lasts patent wise for seven years. When the patent goes off any generic facsimile can be produced by anyone at that time. As a result each company has a narrow window in which they can recover their research and development costs with a given product. Other states have made attempts to set up a similar system in the past, including the state of California. However, the difficulty in comparing each pharmaceutical product to another is extremely complicated. In addition, the administrative costs in arriving at the 'best' common treatment drug are high.620 There is a legal problem as well in this area. Any so called 'refund or rebate' returned to the state would have to be shared with the Federal Medicaid Program. Frankly, since there may well be no bids offered in this situation this problem may not occur because the state will have no savings to share with the federal government and Medicaid. More serious, however, is the effect that the competive bidding proposal at issue could have on the quality of health care services provided to recipients under the Medicaid program. If it is not economically feasible for pharmaceutical manufacturers to supply drug products at a reduced price, these products will probably be eliminated from Medicaid coverage. What occurs in this instance is that the Kansas Medicaid Pharmacy Program would be structured on the basis of marketing decisions of individual manufacturers rather than on the basis of- rational considerations regarding the necessary and appropriate drug therapy for the clients of SRS. The final irony in this particular situation is that for more than a year now, members of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have been meeting with the medical assistance staff of SRS.attempting to cooperate and establish new techniques and regimens to reduce costs incurred by Medicaid in the disposition of certain medical products. Despite the efforts of the industry, members of the staff of SRS have refused to go forward with these possible cost saving measures and have instead chosen the bid-rebate program which has proven to not produce any savings and in effect limits physicians in Kansas from utilizing all possible pharmaceutical treatments that could reduce hospitalizations and other treatments that are far more expensive. I, or representatives of any of our member companies, would be most willing to meet with you to discuss in detail this issue at your convenience. Thank you for your consideration of this issue and we are at your call for any further information in this area. Very Trtily Yours, William M.

ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINION NO. 89- 74 Winston Barton, Secretary Social and Rehabilitation Services Docking State Office Bldg., 6th Floor Topeka, Kansas 66612 RE: Commerce and Trade -- Monopolies and Combinations in Restraint of Trade -- Discrimination in Price; Discrimination; State Drug Bidding Program; Participation by Other States Monopolies and Unfair Trade -- Restraint of Trade; General Provisions -- Unfair Trade Synopsis: Although the proposed drug bid program raises serious antitrust questions, it is our opinion that it does not represent a per se violation of antitrust laws. Under a rule of reason analysis the proposed bid program may survive an antitrust challenge. The proposed program should be -conducted in a manner that renders the market more, rather than less, competitive and does not allow one manufacturer to unlawfully possess market power to the exclusion of its competitors. Cited herein: 15 U.S.C. 5 1-27. * * * Dear Secretary Barton: You request our opinion concerning a proposed pharmaceutical bid program and extension of that bid program to other states wishing to participate. You specifically ask whether the bid process and the extension of the process to other states violates antitrust laws. Pursuant to conversations with and correspondence from the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) and its legal staff, we understand that the bid process works as follows: SRS solicits and accepts separate bids on each of certain specific drugs from any and all manufacturers of that drug; each drug is separately bid; bids will be accepted on the generic equivalent as well as the therapeutic version of each drug; the manufacturer who submits the winning bid on each drug will become the only manufacturer of that drug that SRS will reimburse (when that manufacturer's brand of the drug is used by Medicaid/ MediKan recipients); only one manufacturer for each type of drug will be so'designated and SRS will not reimburse for brands of the same drug manufactured by unsuccessful bidders; when a participating provider-pharmacist dispenses the designated drug to a Medicaid/Medixan recipient, that Medicaid/MediKan recipient must pay a flat co-payment fee to the pharmacist;623 the provider-pharmacist then submits a claim to SRS; SRSreimburses the participating provider-pharmacist for the costsof the designated drug that the co-payment fee did notcover; SRS then takes all the claims it has received fromparticipating provider-pharmacists and submits those claimsand amounts to the bid winner for each drug; the winning drugmanufacturer then gives a rebate to SRS for the differencebetween the amount SRS paid to the provider-pharmacist andthe amount of the winning bid price. For example: (1) the winning bid is accepted from amanufacturer at $1.00 per unit for drug Z; (2) drug Z is soldby the manufacturer to a participating provider-pharmacist for$2.50 per unit; (3) a Medicaid/MediKan recipient buys drug Zfrom that participating provider-pharmacist, who charges aretail price for the drug of $5.00 per unit; (4) theMedicaid/MediKan patient pays the required flat feeco-payment of .50 cents per unit; (5) the participatingprovider-pharmacist submits a claim for the unpaid cost of thedrug, $4.50 or $2.00 (dependent upon whether SRS reimburseswholesale or retail costs); (6) SRS submits a claim to thewinning manufacturer for the difference between the -provider-pharmacist claim ($4.50 or $2.00) and the winning bid($1.00), $3.50 or $1.00. The amount paid from the winningmanufacturer to the state is characterized as a rebate. Therebate paid to SRS from the winning bid manufacturer will be.paid to-the state general fund. SRS believes this bid program will result in costcontainment for the state and has used this drug bid procedurefor almost two years. Approximately 95% of all Kansaspharmacies participate in supplying drugs toMedicaid/MediKan recipients. Certain unavailable information may have a significant impactupon the permissibility of the proposed bid program: detailsconcerning geographic market; the relevant market share andmarket power; the intentions of the participating states orother entities; the exact nature of the interstate cooperationagreement; each participating state's enabling legislation;and the length of time the bid and the interstate agreementwill be in effect. As we do not have specific informationconcerning these and other possible fact issues, this opinionis general in nature and is limited to a discussion ofantitrust principles as they apply to the facts currentlybefore us. It is hoped that the discussion contained hereinwill provide guidance and allow SRS to conduct the bidprogram procedure in accordance with and mindful of antitrustprinciples. You state that the details and terms of a multi-stateprogram have not been established. Because many states areinterested in participating and because the successful bidwinner's brand could become the only brand that states willreimburse Medicaid recipients for, the successful bid winnercould significantly increase or assure itself of a largemarket for each drug. The geographic market, market share andrelevant market for each successful bidder cannot beascertained at this point. Nevertheless, it is obvious thatshould a significant number of states participatenonsuccessful bidders could potentially lose or be precludedfrom obtaining a significant amount of business.Nonsuccessful bidders would be able to sell their product topharmacies wishing to stock their brands and pharmacistsremain able to sell any brand of drug to the general public orto state and federal aid recipients, but any Medicaidrecipient wishing to have the state pay drug costs will haveto purchase the approved brand. Thus, pharmacists have astrong incentive to stock adequate quantities of that brand.and Medicaid recipients are extremely likely to request thatbrand. The general purpose of antitrust laws is the subject of muchdiscussion between legal authority and economists. Broadlyand generally stated, antitrust laws seek to promote,encourage and maintain competition and to prevent harmfulmonopolies. See generally City of Chanute Kansas v.Williams Natural Gas Company, 678 F.Supp. The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, forbids monopolizing trade in broad and general terms. Violation requires the possession of monopoly power i3 a relevant market and the knowing intentional acquisition of that power by two or more conspirators. McKenzie v. Mercy Hospital of Independence, Kansas, 854 F.2d 365, 367 (I0th Cir. 1988). The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. S5 12-27, prohibits specific anticompetitive behavior outside the broad scope of the Sherman Act. See generally 54 Am.Jur.2d Monopolies S 111 )1971). The Clayton Act seeks to promote competition through protection of viable, small and locally owned businesses. Ford Motor Company v. United States, 405 U.S. 562, 92 S.Ct. 1142, 31 L.Ed.2d 492 (1972). The Robinson-Patman Act was enacted to strengthen sections of the Clayton Act and seeks to protect small businesses unable to purchase in quantity. See FTC v. Morton Salt, 334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (1948). State antitrust laws vary in scope and application and each participating state must examine its own antitrust laws. In order to determine whether a particular action violates antitrust laws it becomes necessary to characterize the questioned or challenged activity. Antitrust principles look at two types of anticompetitive relationships, horizontal and vertical. Horizontal restraints are arrangements between entities operating on the same level; manufacturers, suppliers or buyers. The proposed interstate drug bidding arrangement could be characterized as a horizontal arrangement between two entities operating on the same level, i.e. states as buyers or insurers. Practices that may result in a prohibited horizontal restraint include price fixing, boycotts of a product, manufacturer or customer, and mergers resulting in a monopoly. See Vakerics \"Antitrust Basics\", pp. 6-1 through 6-4911988). Vertical restraints are conditions or restrictions agreed to, imposed or directed at entities operating at different levels. Vertical relationships which may exist in the proposed drug bidding program include the relationship between the states' and the drug manufacturers, the states and the provider-pharmacists, the states and the general public, and the states and the benefit recipients. Vertical restraints include dictating resale prices, Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 102 S.Ct. 2466 73 L.Ed.2d 48 (1982), or non-price restraints such as territorial or customer restrictions, price discrimination, exclusive dealing or requirement contracts, and tie-ins. Antitrust restraints that may be implicated by the proposed bid program include price fixing, boycott, price discrimination, and requirement contract considerations. Price fixing restraints are traditionally considered per se illegal.,while non-price restraints are more.often subject to the rulecotfreason. Courts currently evidencea reluctance to impose atper se rule unless there is clear evidence of intent to monopolize or otherwise hinder helpful competition. Rather, courts now frequently use a rule of reason analysis to determine antitrust violations. Under the \"rule of reason' the legality of restraints on trade is determined by weighing all the factors in a case, such as the history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy and the purpose or ends thought to be attained. Blacks Law Dictionary 1196 (5th ed. 1979). Generally, price fixing is any combination formed for the purpose and effect of raising, depressing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity. United States v Socony Vacuum Oil Company, 310 U.S. 150, 223, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940). Sharing information on prices may also result in-improper price fixing. See United States v. Container Corporation of America, 393 U.S. 333, 89 S.Ct. 510, 21 L.Ed.2d 526 (1969). However, where third parties are not affected by the price fixing scheme, a rule of reason will usually be applied. Medical Arts Pharmacy v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 675 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1982). See generally Hjelmfelt, \"Antitrust and Regulated Industries', pp. 42-45 (1985).625 The proposed bid program does not appear to be a vertical orhorizontal price fixing scheme. The states are a large buyeror buyers seeking the lowest price on a commodity. If thestates were considered competitors there could be a possiblehorizontal price fixing charge against them. However, theproposed drug bid program does not dictate and will notautomatically affect the price charged to and paid byparticipating provider-pharmacists to the drug manufacturer.Moreover, the resale price to the general public or benefitrecipients is not dictated by the drug bidding program.- Thebid reflects the price at which each manufacturer independently agrees to ultimately provide the drugs to thestate or states. The states ask that each manufacturer fixits own individual price, and the states remain free to eitheraccept or reject each bid. Thus, the price is fixed by themanufacturer not by the states, and it is therefore unlikelythat a price fixing claim would succeed. Another possible antitrust principle that may be involvedconcerns boycotts. A boycott is \"a method of pressuring aparty ...by withholding or enlisting others to withholdpatronage or services.\" St. Paul Fire and Marine InsuranceCompany v. Barry, 431 U.S. 531, 541, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 57L.Ed.zo 932 (1978). X boycott may be illegal if itimpermissibly increas s market strength through concertedefforts. The Fifth Circuit held what a per se rule would be appliedto boycotts only when there was evidence of an anticompetitive motive, a commercial purpose rather anindustry self-regulation, and coercive economic pressure.St. Bernard General Hospital v. Hospital ServiceAssociation, 712 F.2d 978 (5th Cir. 1983). When there isno evidence of exclusionary anticompetitive purpose, intentor conduct, a rule of reason generally applies. AmericanMedical Association v. United States, 130 F.2d 233 (D.C.Cir. 1942), affd. 317 U.S. 519, 63 S.Ct. 326, 89 L.Ed. 434 (1943) In the proposed drug bid program there is no obvious evidencethat the states or the provider-pharmacists are gettingtogether and refusing to deal with certain drug manufacturersfor an anticompetitive purpose. The articulated reason forencouraging use of the successful bidder's brand by the statesis to keep costs paid for these drugs at a minimum. Theintent to contain costs is not a refusal to deal but rather anintent to obtain the most competitive price and thus topromote and encourage competition among suppliers. Using the rule of reason analysis, cost containment representsa valid competitive purpose. Reasonable contract terms andfree and open access to the bidding process will lessen thepossibility of a successful boycott claim against the states.However, the fact that only one manufacturer will be approvedfor each drug, even if more than one drug manufacturer submitsthe same low bid, undermines this cost containment argumentand purpose. Rather, the purpose of accepting only onemanufacturer appears to be either administrative ease or aneffort to increase the bargaining power of the states. Westrongly suggest that price containment purposes remain therationale and primary focus of the drug bidding program. Eachand every manufacturer of a required drug should be given anequal opportunity and be encouraged to compete for thisbusiness. No intent to exercise exclusionary anticompetitive pressure should be evidenced orcontemplated by participating states. If the states aresatisfied that the bid price of more than one brand is thelowest price they can expect or get, it may be advisable toaward the business to more than one manufacturer. The proposed drug bid program also resembles a requirementcontract, which is defined as \"[a contract in which] oneagrees to buy, for sufficient consideration, all themerchandise of a designated type which the buyer may requirefor use ...one in which a party agrees to supply a specificgood which another party may need during a certain period foran agreed price.\" Blacks Law Dictionary 1172 (9th ed.1979). In the proposed bid program, the state agrees to626 ultimately pay the price of any drug ushed bya benefit recipient if that recipient uses the brand of a successful bidder. Thus, the insurer-state agrees to purchase all drugs of a particular type that it requires from one manufacturer. Requirement contracts are examples of non-price vertical restraints. The risk of antitrust problems increase in relation to the relative market power created by a requirements contract. Vakerics, Antitrust Principles\" S 7.1 (1988). A requirement contract may violate antitrust law if an arrangement substantially lessens interbrand competition and competitors are seriously hindered or foreclosed from an available market for a significant period of time. See Tampa Electric Company v. Nashville Coal Company, 365 U.S.320, 81 S.Ct. 623, 5 L.Ed.2d 580 (1961); Standard Oil Company of California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 69 S.Ct. 1051, 93 L.Ed. 1371 (1949). Several federal courts have examined the concept of exclusive dealing or requirement contracts in the health care field. These cases evidence a willingness to permit these arrangements if competition is not substantially lessened or a relevant market monopolized. See DosSantosv. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Center, 684 F.2d 1346 (7th Cir. 1982); White and White, Inc. v. American Hospital Supply Corp., 540 F.Supp. 951 (Mich. 1982)revd on other grnds, 723 F.2d 495 (6th Cir. 1983). In Medical Arts Pharmacy of Stanford, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Conn., Inc., 518 F.Supp. 1100 (D. Conn. 1981), affd per curiai, 675 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1982), the district court found that the defendant insurer was the purchaser even though the insureds actually used and obtained the drug. The second circuit court seems to imply that if market share is large enough there may be sufficient monopsony power exercised by one large buyer to sustain a competitive seller's claim that a pharmaceutical purchasing agreement obtained without collusion could be anticompetitive and a violation of the Sherman Act. See also Sutliff, Inc. v. Donovan Cos., 727 F.2d 648, 655 (7th Cir. 1984); Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 547 (5th Cir. 1980); Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 660 F.2d 1195 (7th Cir. 1981) cert. den. 455 U.S. 1020 (1982). (Monopsony; 'a condition of the market in which there is but one buyer for a particular commodity.\" Blacks Law Dictionary 908 (5th ed. 1979).) Most joint buying arrangements have potential efficiencies which remove them from per se violation of antitrust laws. Under the rule of reason, agreements or combinations may be prohibited if they prejudice the public interest by unduly restricting competition or obstructing the course of trade. Reazin v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., 635 F.Supp. 1287 (Kan. 1986). In a 1987 paper presented to the National Health Lawyers Association Conference on Antitrust Law in the Health Care Field, Michael L. Denger stated that the Federal Trade Commission considers government insurance programs to be purchasers of health care services, thus making such programs part of a relevant market. However, Mr. Denger noted that membership in a prepaid prescription drug organization making up less than 30 percent of the retail pharmaceutical sales in a geographic market will probably not be challenged by the Justice Department. Other authorities believe obtaining more than 17 to 20 percent of a relevant or geographic market will result in an antitrust law violation. It therefore becomes necessary to determine the geographic market for each drug and of each manufacturer in the bid program and what percentage of the relevant market will be given to the winning manufacturer as a result of the proposed bid program. This requires detailed factual information concerning the amount of a particular type of drug sold nationally, and in each participating state or area, and what percentage of those sales could, pursuant to this bid program, be given exclusively to the winning manufacturer. When the market share does not confer market power, anticompetitive claims become less plausible. However, antitrust laws may prohibit the proposed bid program if it allows one manufacturer to obtain an unusually large share of a relevant market, thus essentially reducing or precluding all helpful competition. The length of time that the agreement will allow the winning manufacturer to obtain this market share will alsobe relevant.627 Unless a substantial share of a relevant market is foreclosedfor a significant period of time, or unless there is ananticompetitive purpose or intent, an exclusive dealing orrequirements contract will generally not present antitrust problems under a rule of reason analysis. Vakerics at\u00a7 7.09. We therefore suggest that any agreement entered intobetween the states or between an individual state and apharmaceutical manufacturer be for a limited time period andinitially allow every manufacturer equal access to thisparticular market. Once the proposed bid program and thedegree of state participation is determined, an analysis ofthe pertinent market data can be made. It is our opinion that, under the rule of reason, unless there is ananticompetitive intent or a large percentage of the entiremarket for each particular drug will be foreclosed to othermanufacturers for a significant period of time, the proposeddrug bid program does not represent impermissible large scalebuying or a prohibited requirement contract. 15 U.S.C. S 13(a) discusses price discrimination. Most recentprice discrimination cases do not involve governmental prosecution, but rather, are brought by parties allegedly harmed by the behavior. Illegal price discrimination may bealleged by nonparticipating states, pharmaceutical companieswho lose business, or members of the public orprovider-pharmacists who do not receive the same price.Without specific information we cannot discuss the merits orstanding of such challenges. Generally, any unwarranted pricefavoritism shown by suppliers to larger purchases not based onpermissible justifications or defenses may be a violation ofantitrust laws. See Gianelli Distributing Company v.Beck and Company, 172 Cal.App. 3rd 120, 219 Cal . Rptr. 230 (1985); Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association Inc. v. Abbbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150, 103S.Ct. 1011, 74 L.Ed.2d 882 (1983); Portland Foundation Health Plan, 662 F.2d 641 (9th Cir. 1981). The price paid by the pharmacist and the patient-purchaser foreach particular drug is not necessarily altered by the drugbid program. Rather, the drug bid program establishes theultimate price that the state insurer will pay for the drug.The same drug (with the same shipping, manufacturing and otherassociated costs) will ultimately be made available to thestate at a potentially different and lower price than theprice paid by others. The provider-pharmacist will notnecessarily be charged less for the drugs used by Medicaid/MediKan recipients. Ultimately, however, othersmay pay more for the same drug. 15 U.S.C. 5 13b permits rebates from a cooperative associationto its members, producers, or consumers, but rebates may notbe used to violate price discrimination laws. See BargainCar Wash, Inc. v. Standard Oil Company, 466 F.2d 1163 (7thCir. 1972). The fact that the states are paying a potentially lower price for the same drugs may not representprice discrimination if a valid defense can be claimed. Thedefendant (often the supplier) in an antitrust case can rebuta claim of illegal price discrimination by showing that thereare lower costs in serving this particular purchaser, changingconditions allow a change in price, or competition is met andjustifies the lower price. See Hansen, \"Robinson-Patman Law\", LI Fordham L. Rev. 113T(1983). Prices set or obtained by governmental entities may notrepresent price discrimination if the activity is of agovernmental nature. Generally, the Robinson-Patman Actdoes not apply to sales made to the government. SeeGasliqht Company of Columbus v. Georgia Power Company, 313P.Supp. 860, 440 F.2d 1135, cert. den., 404 U.S. 1062, 92S.Ct. 732, 30 L.Ed.2d 750 reh. den., 405 U.S. 969, 92S.Ct. 1162, 31 L.Ed.2d 244 (1970). However, governmentalimmunity is not extended to every act or every price set by agovernmental entity. See Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150, 103S.Ct. 1011, 74 L.Ed.2d 882 (1993). Immunity from antitrust laws exists for a governmental entity if (1) the challengedrestraint is one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed by state policy and (2) the policy itself isactively supervised by the state. See Russell v. City ofKansas City, Kansas, 690 F.Supp. 947 (Ken. 1988).628 Using the analysis articulated in Russell, SRS and other state agencies may be able to make a legitimate argument that involvement in drug bidding programs is immune from antitrust laws. Most social welfare agencies are given authority to administer the state's medical programs and thus the argument can be made that the legislature's authorization of that administration either contemplated the resulting anticompetitive effects or such activities were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the authorization. However, those challenging this activity may argue that the legislature allows SRS (and other equivalent agencies) to provide medical care, not to set prices in violation of antitrust laws. Jefferson County, 460 U.S. 150, 103 S.Ct. 1011, 74 L.Ed.2d 882 (1983), involved the sale of pharmaceutical products to state and local government hospitals in competition with private pharmacies. The Court, in a five to four decision, held that these actions were not exempt from the Robinson-Patman Act. However, the opinion noted that \"we are not concerned with ...state purchases for use in traditional governmental functions ...[nevertheless) we conclude that the exemption does not apply where a state has, chosen to compete in the private retail market.\" Id. at . 153-154. In footnote seven the court acknowledged that it was not addressing whether sales by the state to indigents were in competition with private enterprises. Thus, this remains an unresolved issue. Kansas legislators have given SRS broad authority in the area of medical care benefits for qualified persons. This delegation has allowed SRS much regulatory and discretionary authority concerning implementation of the benefits program. If SRS authorities exercise this delegated authority by participating in the drug bid program and the legislature does not act to limit this authority, it is our opinion that, even if an antitrust law would otherwise be violated, governmental immunity may allow SRS to take part in this program. Agencies from other states who wish to participate in the r proposed drug bid program must individually examine whether their state's policies and enabling acts authorize participating in such a program and whether the state actively supervises its implementation. In conclusion, although the proposed bid program raises serious antitrust questions, we believe it does not represent -a per se violation of antitrust laws. Under a rule of reason analysis, the proposed drug bid program may survive an antitrust challenge. The drug bid program should be conducted so as to provide that (1) each manufacturer is given an equal -and meaningful opportunity to compete for this business, with no voice in determining which manufacturer is selected, (2) the participant states should not be competing purchasers who conspire to fix a buying price, (3) objective bidding criteria should be maintained, (4) each participant pharmacist, benefit recipient and purchaser should remain free to select any and all pharmaceutical providers with which they wish to contract, (5) the winning manufacturer should not be allowed to possess a market power that unreasonably excludes or eliminates all competition, -and (6) the terms-of the agreement should be for a reasonable and limited time period. If, under the rule of reason analysis, a potential antitrust violation remains a possibility, governmental immunity may nevertheless allow the activity-if: (1) each pariEcipatiig state agency has authority-to enter into such an-arrangement; (2) the state actively supervises the program; and (3) the anticompetitive results are expected or foreseeable. Specific legislative enactment allowing each aspect of the program could effectively negate most claims that the participating states violated antitrust laws. Very truly yours, ROBER T.

Some of these products are snid over-the-counter in the coiuntry of origin while others are available fromn clinics where the purchaser was treated. Such products are often shipped to the purchaser by mail. Even though such products are subject to refusal, we may use our discretion to examine the background, risk, slid purpose of these products before making a final decision. To assure that the districts are operating in a uniform manner, the following guidance is provided for dealing with personal use shipments. 1. Except as modified by these instructions, established guidance found in RPM-9-71, exhibits X9-71-1 and X9-71-2 should be followed. 2. A product entered for personal use, which meets the criteria in item 4 below, may proceed without sampling or detention. 3. Products that are not identified, or are not accompanied by documentation of intended use, should be detained. Other reasons for detention may includel size of the shipment (amount inconsistent with personal use), fraudulent promotion or misrepresentation, or an unreasonable health risk due to either toxicity or possible contamination. In such cases, the approppriate center should be contacted for guidance concerning release of the product. 4. Following detention, shipments may be released to an individual if the following criteria can be satisfied and there is no safety risk or evidence of fraud: o the product was purchased for personal use o the product is not for commercial distribution and the amount of product is not excessive (i.e., 3 months supply of a drug) o the intended use of the product is appropriately identified o the patient seeking to import the product affirms in writing that it is for the patient's own use and provides the name and address of the doctor licensed in the U.S. responsible for his or her treatment with the product 5.

Young, M.D., Ph.D. Commissioner of food and Drugs Food and Drug Administration 5600 Fishers Lane HF-1, RM. 1471 Rockville, Maryland 20857 Dear Dr. Young: I eu writing on behalf of Lyphomed, Inc. concerning amatter of-serious concern to this company, i.e., recentevidence of sales in the United States of unapprovedpentamidine. Of particular concern is a recent NewYork Times news report and Health News Dailv ofTiember 27, 1989 that suggest aoir.ndliliuals, groups, and organisations believe they can, consistentwith FDA's policy and in compliance with applicablelaw, import unapproved pentamidine from other countriesto compete with the approved Lyphomed product. Certainly, the law does not allow such imports and, aswe understand it, FDA policy would not permit suchimports to avoid enforcement action. we are writing toyou only becasee of our growing concern that the FDA'spolicy might change with respect to pentamidine and other pharmaceutical drugs marketed in the UnitedStates which have a similar status. If the FDA wereconsidering changing its policy to allow importation ofunapproved drugs to compete with legitimately approvedand available drugs in this country, Lyphomed wouldlike an opportunity to meet with you to explain thegrave consequences such a change in policy wouldentail, its implications to the entire U.S. pharmaceutical industry, and other reasons why such achange in policy should not be adopted. If, on theother hand, present policy will not be changed, I amsure that the U.S .pharmaceutical industry will begreatly relieved if the FDA would take action that isappropriate to stop the illegal importation of drugsand discourage those who circumvent the law. As you know, federal law strictly prohibits theimportation of a new drug that has not been approved bythe food and Drug Administration, 21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a). Also, by well-established precedent, it isillegal to sell an unapproved new drug after it hascrossed state or national boundaries, 21 U.S.C. &331(k) se e, X, United States v. Articles of Drug,625 r.2d m (C\u00a7thi Cii7TV10T'YSat law is clearlyunderstood by all involved, and pharmaceuticalcompanies make business plans based on the legitimateexpectation that that law will be enforced. The FDA's \"personal use' policy, by its terms and byFDA's public interpretation, applies only to drugs thatare not approved in the United States. The policy was,as we understand it, intended to permit, in verylimited circumstances, the noncommercial importation for personal use of drugs not yet legally available inthe United States.648 it is true that there are many pharmaceutical drugs sold at a lower price in other countries. There a*re anny reasons for such price differentials. One major reason is that the price of drugs in the United States reflects the tremendous costs associated with the research and development of drugs, not only the costs of research necessary to convince FDA that it is appropriate to approve such drugs for U.S. marketing but also the costs of Phase 4 and other follow-up research, all of which demand major financial investment and human resources. Pantasidine is a classic example of a drug that has made its way through a tremendously expensive R&D and regulatory process. Lyphomed cannot support the viewpoint of a few who sight argue that pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of AIDS should be provided at en artificially low price. As some AIDS patients and activists have asserted, that argument is shortsighted. It is undeniable that AIDS patienta at risk of or suffering from PCP are also at great risk from other AIDS-related opportunistic infections and diseases -- all of which are life-threatening. Thus, each such patient has a very personal stake in encouraging, rather than discouraging, pharmaceutical companies to invest in AIDS and AIDS-related therapies. Limiting the return on such investments in, accordingly, not good public policy or in the best interest of the national AIDS community. As you know, a drug company takes a very large risk whenever it pursues development of any drug. In many cases, a drug company will work hard and expand millions of dollars in testing of drugs that fail the testing phases or falter to the extent that they are ultimately not *pprovable. ThuS, in those very few cases in which the company is successful in bringing an important drug to market, there must be a return to the company that is sufficiently great to cover not only the costs attributable to that particular drug but also expected losses on those drugs that are not successful. Only such a system may be expected to motivate public investors to take the risk aesociated with drug development. Lyphomed is in fact actively pursuing improvements of pentamidine in new formulation development, molecular modification in search of safer and more effective analogues, and in the technological development of superior delivery systems. Lyphomed also has other compounds under development for life-threatening and devastating diseases such as bone metastases, taget's Disease, osteoporoeis, cancer pain, etc. Lyphomed has absolutely no assurance that any of those products will ever be marketed. All of the expenditures on them could be lost. We need hardly *mphasise that Lyphomed'S AIDS and other research programs have substantial costs of clear relevance to the AIDS community that go beyond the costs directly associated with pentaxidine. There are, however, in this case very significant costs directly associated with pentamidine itself. The studies on the basis of which the NDA for aerosol pentamidine was approved cost approximately S20 million. As a condition of approval, Lyphomed was asked to perform, and has agreed to perform, phase 4 studies that Lyphomed estimates will cost approximately another $15 million. In addition, Lypho-ed has been working with AIDS support groups nationwide to provide an interim patient assistance program for AIDS patients who need penta-idine with $2 million worth of this drug. (Note that the Lyphomed contribution is not conditioned in any sense on government matching funds.) Lyphomed has not received any funding from the government or government agencies. In fact, Lyphomed has been generous in providing funding and free drugs for a number of studies being conducted by the NIAID.649 Moreover, Lyphomed must take into account the fact that the Orphan Drug Act exclusivity through June, 1996 granted to the aerosol product will be, Os a practical matter, nearly illusory in slightly over two yeara when the Orphan Drug Act exclusivity on the injectable version of pentanidine runs out on October 29, 1991. Thereafter, generic companies can be expected to sall pentamidine, labeled as an injectable product. There is little doubt that some patients and physicians will simply use that product for the aerosol Indication, despite the lack of labelijg for that use. in other words, Lyphom d'a WebuPent (aerosol form) will lose exclusivity nearly five years before the legal tern of exclusivity granted ends in 19961 in addition, Lyphomed is seriously concerned that, to date, Lyphomad has been given no confirmation that FDA will reject the attempts of a compotitor, Fisone, to convince the FDA to approve a Fiont pentamidine product despite what we believe are the clear terms of the Orphan Drug Act's exclusivity provisions barring such an approval. Pentamidine is, in any case, not the sole (or even the most commonly used) therapy available for its indicated uses. The current PCr prophylaxis market is divided among TNP/SMX (which is the drug used mait often), Lyphomed's pentamidine product (Nobuient ), and Dapsone. Moreover, investigational protocols looking at new agents (i.e., Fanaedar, Trimetrexate, PriMaquine plus Clindamyci., DiNA, etc.). Lyphosed was a pioneer in working with, and la continuing to work with AIDS support groups and with AIDS patients, to develop pentamidinevs potential andto assure that it is used properly to save lives. inorder to accomplish this important goal, however, Lyphomed has had to be -- and must continue to be -- a well-run business attractive to investors. Lyphomed, like other drug companies, in ordetr to plan on developing AIDS drugs in the future, must have some arsurance hat it will not face the clearly illegal importation of foreign products purchased from suppliers that have not had to undergo the expense of obtaining FDA approval. Again, we are confident that FDA will, consistent with current policy, enforce the law vigorously with reepeot to illegal importation and sales of unapproved pentasidine and other pharmaceutical drugs. Should the Agency seriously contemplate another course. however, we would like an opportunity to Meet with you to explain in more detail the effects of such a decision on, and the serious threat that such a decision would pose to, the U.S. research and development process, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, and Lyphosed in particular.

COLORADO 8003 NEW 728-4901 November 15, 1989 HAND DELIVERY Mr. David Schulke Special Committee on Aging United States Senate SD-G31 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg. Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear David: Enclosed, per our discussion yesterday evening, is the letter we sent to Terry Beirn. The letter provides a background on Lyphomed and pentamidine, answers some questions that Terry had raised, and includes a chronology. Also enclosed are reports that Lyphomed has received from its consultant concerning theavailability of government reimbursement for pentamidine for indigent patients in various states. We understand that those reports are based on telephone conversations with State officials and that the consulting group is still in the process of getting hard copies of the applicable state regulations-and guidelines. The Lyphomed indigent program is based, as were the community clinical trials that it sponsored, on a partnership with local groups treating people with AIDS. Not-for-profit clinics or groups from around the country have contacted Lyphomed to be included in the program. Each was sent a questionnaire designed to elicit information concerning its status and the needs of the people it serves. When the questionnaires are returned, Lyphomed has begun shipping the drugs. The program, obviously, depends on the cooperation of those involved in clinics serving people with AIDS. On the broader issue of the price of the drug, there appears to me to be a potential for working out a solution to that problem that would not deprive the company of funding necessary for additional research on pentamidine and related drugs. We would like, at this point, simply to avoid polarizing those concerned with the issue to the extent possible until the company can, in discussions with leaders of the AIDS support community, reach a consensus on how to proceed. (I enclose a copy of a request by a coalition of groups concerned with the AIDS crisis for a meeting with Lyphomed. Lyphomed is eager to have that meeting, which we expect will be scheduled fairly soon.) Thank you for calling us about the hearing. I am sure we will be talking further as this matter progresses Sincerely, Donald 0. Beers Enclosures653 ARNOLD & PORTER 2200 NEW HA.PSMIRE AVENUE. N. W bornE .0(001 TR 10-WASHINGTON. 0.

We have prepared the answers in accord with what we understand to be your intent in asking thea, that is, to gather as much information as possible to give you abackground on the issues. In some situations in which we have not been able to obtain documentation, we aresimply providing Lyphomed's best recollection andunderstanding of events. Of some points we are verycertain, since we have supporting documents. As vs view it, the development of pentamidine hasbeen a resarkable Orphan Drug Act success story forwhich Congress frankly deserves a great deal of credit. In this letter, I explain why we think that is the case.That narrative description of events is followed by thequestions and ansvers. Finally, in response to yourrequest at out mneting on October 25, 1989, we have alsoincluded a chronology of Lyphomed'* involvement withpentaxidins. PENTA111DIRUo AN ORPHAN DRUG ACT SUCCESS STORY Lyphoed became involved with pentamidine in 1983. At that tine, Lyphanmd was a small company specLaliLang in generic drugs. The company had, hovever, en expertise in the technique calledElyophilization,' a process critical in the manufacture of pentauidine. In that year the Federal Centers forDisease Control ('CDC') was seeking a U.S. source Ofpentanidine. The original manufacturer of the drug, May a Baker, a Rhone-Poulenc subsidiary located in GreatBritain, stopped supplying pentamidine to the CDC. CDCthen began a search for a U.S. pharmaceuticalmanufacturer of pentanidine because it was important inthe treatment of pnmmDeymaifti carinil pneumonia (\"PCP1), at that timn a relatively rare infection that attackspatients with impaired immune systes. In 1983, the number of AIDS patients suffering from PCP wassmall -reported by the National Organization for Rare Diseases (ENORD') to be between 300-600 patients -- and no U.S. drug manufacturer was interested in producing the drug. In early 1984, according to NORD, a medicale*ergency had developed as available supplies had run out. (US enclosed copy of NORD 1988 Corporate Award statement.)654 As a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services News Release (October 24, 1984) (copy enclosed) makes clear, CDC and FDA -recruitsed]l Lyphomed to make the drug commercially available in the U.S. Thus, Lyphomed was the only company that responded to the request from CDC, agreeing to produce 3,000 vials of the drug for CDC. Subsequently, at CDC's suggestion, Lyphomed took on the responsibility of becoming a cammercial supplier of pentamidine. The company filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for pentamidine which was approved by the FDA. Pentamidine was designated as an orphan drug and seven years of exclusivity was granted to Lyphomed. Lyphomed could not have taken on the costs associated with commercial production and marketing of what was essentially an \"innovator' drugl without the exclusivity provided by the Orphan Drug Act. Certainly Lyphomed would not have been able to support research on the development on the aerosol version of pentamidine in the absence of Orphan Drug Act exclusivity. Soon after it began marketing pentasidine in 1984, Lyphomed became aware that a few physicians were investigating the possibility that pentamidine could be used, in an aerosol form, to prevent PCP. Theinjectable use of pentamidine carries a high risk of serious side effects, making it inappropriate for prophylaxis. The use of the drug through the aerosol mechanism targeted directly to the lungs, however, showed a promise of avoiding those serious side effects and thus making pentamidine a reasonable choice for use in preventing PCP. While some independent research was being done onthis potential use of pentamidine, it became apparentthat significant funding and human resources would have to be provided to determine whether or not this was a safe and effective use of the drug and, ultimately, tofile an NDA with FDA and obtain approval of the new use. It is considerably more difficult and takes much longer to prove efficacy and safety for prophylaxis as opposed to treatment of a diease. Were ther no Orphan Drug Act, no commercial enterprise could rationally make the 1 Marketing a generic drug (Lyphomed's business at that time) is considerably cheaper than marketing an innovator product. For one thing, the manufacturer ofthe generic drug does not need to bear the expense of educating physicians on how to ue the drug. Theinnovator company has already done that. In fact, when Lyphomed first sold pentamidine, it initiallydistributed it in the way it distributed generic drugs. It became apparent, however, that simply making pentamidine available to pharmacists and hospitals did not ensure usage by physicians. As long as physicians did not know about the drug and did not know how to use it, it would not be used by physicians in treating patients who needed it. Lyphomed, therefore, took on the costs of educating physicians about the drug by hiring a detail force that was assigned to perform that function. Lyphomed was required to raise the price of pentamidine on two occasions, from approximately $23 pervial in 1984 to approximately $54 per vial, in 1986 -- a period of two years -- to pay for the necessary detail force and initial research efforts on aerosol pentamidine which commenced in 1984.655 enormous investment necessary to determine whether ornot this proposed use and other innovative uses of thedrug were appropriate. The testing and efforts appliedto pentamidine between 1987-1989 cost more than $20 million and the costs are continuing to mount. No one could expect to recover that cost in a market inwhich prices were met by generic competitors whose costsdo not include research and other costs associated withan innovator product. Because it had Orphan Drug Act exclusivity, Lyphomed was able to initiate and fund a series ofsophisticated clinical trials and to fund a number ofcommunity based trials by raising the price at whichinjectable pentamidin- sold to provide the necessaryincome to pay for these studies.2The rise in the priceallowed Lyphomed, which did not have excess profits from its other operations to invest, to pay for the costsassociated with the development of aerosol pentamidins. From a number of studies with various protocol designs,ultimately it van the carefully conducted and auditedcommunity research trials that shoved that pentanidine was safe and effective for prophylaxis of PCY.Moreover, these trials produced a result that wasunexpected. Statistical analysis determined that theuse of one 300 3g. dose of pentamid'nc per month wasmore effective than the use of 150 mg. dosages ofpentamidine twice per month. Thus, because thisresearch, at thirteen centers involving seventy-threephysicians, was directed and funded by Lyphomed, a moreeffective regimen was discovered to prevent thgdisastrous occurrence of PCP in AlDd patients. Because there was no patent for pentamidine, in aworld without the Orphan Drug Act it is highly unlikelythat anyone would have funded the necessary studies toshow the effectiveness of aerosol pentanidine in preventing PCP. Because this statute vas available, Lyphomed was able to pursue that research and to produce a potentially lifesaving and life extending therapy. OUESTIONS AND ANB2SmW QUESTION 1. Where did the \"push\" to develop Pontamidinm for PCY comefrom? [CDC clearly played trestment of oaute funded agency -- *ob n _ - take the lead in its dgvalogMt * a pCeOP\"lcSiST 2 Lyphomed ultimately raised the puice eR twv additional occasions so that the final price was slightly under $100 per vial or roughly four times the initial, generic drug, price. Lyphomed did not chargethat higher price initially end did not charge it until it became necessary to offset research end other costs. Lyphomed has not increased the price since August 1987. 3 That sinvle dose per onth t msm Is n 1 _ WY 1esa expensive than the bi- y x tb t qphysicians had-initially predict vl be eff tiv.This is because a single dose regimen elULnaUtS thecost of a second physician administration, the nebulizerexpense, and other attendant health care costa duringthe month. In addition, a once-a-month dosage regimen is more convenient for patients end, therefore, enhances their compliance with this prophylaxis regimen.656 It has boen known mince the 1950's thatinjectable pentamidine in effective in the treatment of PCP. In 1983, Rhone-Poulenc's British subsidiary, May & Baker, stopped the U.S. mupply of pentamidine to the CDC. Lyphomed stepped in at the urging of the Federal government to manufacture pentamidine when no other company vas willing to, in order to resolve a medical emergency for what vas then a relatively saall number of AIDS patients. Am a result of this action and because of the company's continued efforts to improve pentamidins and-develop other orphan drugs, Lyphomed has been publicly cited by NORD as \"an outstanding model for the pharmaeeutical .industry as a developer of orphan drugs.e (5A enclosed 12/1/87 letter from NORD to Lyphomed.) There is an alternative drug, trimethoprim/ mulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), for the treatment of PCP that had proven to be safer than pentamidine in non-AIDS pediatric populations. In 1983, however, TMP/SMX was found to be more toxic than p-ntamidine in many AIDS patients. Injection of pentamidine also produced severe side effects in many patients. The need to develop and research new compounds was, therefore, compelling and obvious. Thus, the -push' began to develop alternative drugs, including other formulations of pentamidine, not only to treat PCP in AIDS patients but also to prevent it. In 1984, Lyphomed began support of preclinical research by Drs. Bruce Montgomery and Robert Dabs on aerosolized pentamidine targeted to the lung ( ., aerosol use). Lyphomed committed to grants of drug and any other forms of support as required to support Drs. Montgomery and Dabs in this research. Lyphomed has also supported the work of numerous other researchers in studies of aerosol pentamidine for treatment and for prophylaxis. To our knowledge, Kemorial Sloan Kettering cancer Center reported preclinical work on aerosol delivery of pentamidine in abstract form, but has never published a peer reviewed article on this work. We are not aware of any one institution (public or private) that can fairly be described as having taken the \"lead\" in this research. QUESTION 2. Where was the basic research done that establishod pentaeidine to be effective against the PCP \"parasit-\"? Who funded it? In 1957-1958, an injectable pentamidina trial in humans to treat PCP was carried out in Eastern Europe. Use Of the drug vas found to be effective. We have no information as to who may have funded this initial reeaareh. To our knowledge, no animal research was doneprior to this human experiment. QUESTION 2. Did the idea for inhaling pentamidine to prevent PCP come from academia, government researchers, the developer of the nmbulizer(s), or one of the companies? [Is there a clear first elaim to the idea in the published literature?]657 The idea of inhaled pentamidine to prevent PCPclearly came from academia. In 1972-1973, Dr. Robert Waldman from the University of Florida did initialtoxicity testing of the aerosolized approach using therodent model. He attempted to test the aerosolizedprotocol in the non-PCP-infected rat model. He was,however, unable to induce the PCP successfully andultimately moved on to other areas of research. As Dr. Waldman explains, there was very little intereat intreatment of PCP in 1973 and other matters vere morepressing. Dr. Waldman's work appears in the American Review of Respiratory Disease, Volume 108, pp. 1004-6,October 1973. We understand that there was no fundingfrom any source to support this work. To our knowledge,government researchers, developers of nebulizers, andother companies were totally uninvolved. our inquiries indicate that Dr. Waldman's work isthe first claim to the idea in the published literature. QUESTION 4. When did each of the companies begin active clinicaldevelopment of the product for prophylaxis? When dideach begin development as an acute treat-e-t? CC When was a u.S. IND filed, when was it okayed? CC When was the Canadian \"IND- filed end okayed? CC Were there other significant clinical studiesperformed in other countries -- UK, Prance? To our knowledge, at least four companies havefiled for the orphan drug \"designation' for aerosolpentamidine used for PCP. Of these four, Rhone-Poulencand Zenith did not pursue any clinical research orproduct development in the U.S. We do not have completeinformation on Fisons Corp. 's activities. To our knowledge, Fisons has, however, done no research on the acute treatment of PCP. Fisons had conducted no research on PCP prophylaxis prior to their agreementwith Memorial Sloan Kettering in mid-1987. Preclinical studies on inhaled pentamidinesupported by Lyphomed were started in 1984 by Drs. BruceMontgomery and Robert Debs. Ac a result of encouragingdata, Lyphoned supported Phase 1 trials applicable toboth prophylaxis and treatment in 1986. These studiesprovided further encouraging results. Also in 1986, Lyphomed funded two separate treatment trials using theaerosol mechanism by Dr. John Conte and Dr. Bruce Montgomery. In 1987, Lyphomed supported the San FranciscoCommunity Consortium study for prophylaxis conducted bythirteen centers involving seventy-three physicians. At this time, Lyphomed also supported a pilot treatmentstudy of inhaled pentamidine by Dr. Bruce Montgomery. In March, 1988, Lyphomed commenced, along aparallel track to the community-based studies, twodouble blind, randomized and vell-controlled studies.These were two major nationwide multi-center trials -- one for prophylaxis and one for treatment. Drs. Leoungand Montgomery, respectively, were the principalinvestigators. Finally, data from the San Francisco CommunityConsortium study was gathered and analyzed to form thebasis of Lyphomed's NDA submission along with a numberof other independent supportive studies funded andsupported by Lyphomed. The NDA was initially submitted in July, 1988, resubmitted in September, October andNovember, 1988. The NDA was considered by FDA to havebeen officially filed on November 14, 1988. FDArequested, however, that Lyphomed submit 18-monthefficacy and safety data before the Agency wouldconsider approval of the NDA. A Treatment IND wasgranted in February, 1989. A final filing was made inaccordance with FDA instructions in April, 1989. NDAapproval was given by FDA on June 15, 1989.658 Initially, since injectable pentamLine lus ae FDA-approved drug marketed by Lypbmeed, Dr. Montgomery assumed that an IND for inhalation therapy we net required However, the FDA informed Dr. Montgomery in 1986 that an IND should be filed. Consequently, an IND was filed and approved immediately. Lyphomed has not filed a Canadian INDW\". Fisons must have done so, as it conducted a clinical trial in Canada. We do not have information concerning the dates of any Canadian IND obtained by Fisons. Rhone-Poulenc has been licensed to utilize data obtained by Lyphomed and has used those data to seek approval of pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis in Canada and Europe. To our knowledge, no significant clinical studies have been done in the United Kingdom or in France. Small scale studies have recently been done outside the U.S. using Lyphomed's study design (\u00b11k., using the Lyphomed recommended nebulizer (Respirgard II), dose, and dosage regimen) with excellent results. as to acute treatment, Lyphomed has just completed the largest double-blind, randomized well- controlled multi-center trial for acute treatment of PCP performed to date, utilizing the aerosol delivery system. In addition, Lyphom-d is paying 51% of the cost of a number of NIH trials with pentamidine. To our knowledge, no other company or organization is investigating treatment of PCP with aerosol pentamidine. QUESTION 5. Nov many companies applied for em Orphan Drug designation for prophylactic usage of pentamidine? When did they apply? When was such designation granted? As noted above, vs understand that four companies -- Lyphomed, Fisons, Rhone-Poulenc, and Zenith -- at various times sought and were granted Orphan Drug Act \"designation. We do not know whether others may have sought such designation unsuccessfully. When Lyphomed was granted orphan drug states for pentamidine in October, 1984, the ccuganebelLer d the exclusivity granted by the law covered the pentaldine molecule and all potential uses for treatment and prevention of PCP. Fisons Corporation nevertheless applied for designation for use of aerosol pentamidins for prevention of PCP, apparently in a June 15, 1987 letter to FDA. That application was granted on October 5, 1987. A a consequence, Lyphomed made a similar application on November 2, 1987. Designation was granted to Lyphomed on January 12, 1988. We do not have information on orphan drug designation dates for the other two designees. The grant of designation does-not, of course, suggest that the designee will ever obtain approval, nor does it confer exclusivity. It is the approval of the drug, combined with the designation, that confers orphan drug exclusivity. QUESTION 6. What guidance did each compaDy receive from the FA on criteria to be met in order to have a reasonable expectation of getting an MDR? he Was this guidance consistent between 1985 mnd 19897 55 Was it consistent between the companies? se Did FDA actively encourage a dose cosparison trial design versus placebo control?659 Th* guidance Lyphomed received from the FDA did not vary and yes basically to provide scientificallyvalid evidence of efficacy and safety of inhaled pentamidine irr the prevention of PCP. The FDA did not encourage, or discourage, any particular study design. We have heard that representatives of Fisons have claimed that FM told that company to do a placebo-controlled trial. We have no knowledge of the truth of those allegations, though in our experience FDA doos notdirect the type of trials to be conducted. Fisons may, however, have concluded that, for its specific nebulizer and dosage regimen, a placebo controlled trial would beneceesary to establish safety and effectiveness. In contrast, Lyphomed had already proved safety and efficacy of inhaled pentamidine with the use of the Respirgard II delivery system in the treatment trialsthat were performed in early 1987. What remained was to determine the optimal dose and dosage regimen for prevention of PCP. Since efficacy had already beenestablished, Lyphomed, after consultation withscientists and medical advisors, decided that a placebo controlled study was neither needed nor appropriate. The optimal study design was determined, after careful assessment, to be a dose response trial in aerosol prophylaxis of PCP, even though Lyphomed's type of trial would require a year longer to complete than a placebocontrolled trial. QUISTION 7. What evidence exists aoone-ring nebuliser technology (and other delivery wrame)? In one nebulizersignifiocntly better than another -- sad how oompelling is the evidenoe? A problem with aerosol administration of pentamidine is that pentemidine is en airway irritant. If a medium used particle nebulizer is used, some drug deposits in the alveoli (where PCP orgenisms are believed to be located). However, a substantial amount of drug deposits in the upper airways, resulting in serious airway irritation causing cough or bronchospasm (an asthma-like condition). Therefore, the higher the dose used with a medium sized particle nebulizer, the greater the chance of side effects. If the bronchospasm is severe, the bronchospasm may actually interfere with the delivery of drug to the alveoli and result inineffective treatment. Some experts believe that the use of a large particle nebuliser in the treatment context can be lifethreatening as it might result in ineffective treatment. The published scientific evidence is compellingthat, for treatment, a small particle nebulizer is needed for both optimal efficacy and safety. The beatclinical resulte, both in treatment end in prophylaxis,to eto have been reported with a mll perticle nebulizer -- the Respirgard II. Thus in both treatment end prophylaxis a small particle nebulizer (that minimizes bronchospass while maximizing delivery to the alveoli wher PCP is found) is the optimal device, based on clinical evidence in humane. Kontgomery AB: \"Pneuuoevstis carinii Pneumonia in Patients With the Care.. 1988: (33); 676-685 provided). The state of the art in smallperticle nebulizers is the Respirgard II which is why the Respirgard II was used in all Lyphomed trials after careful evaluation.660 QUZSTION 8. - when did the respective companies become involved inPentemidine's development as a PC? prophylaxis Bydoing what? And spending how such? *a These costs need to be broken out for developmentassociated with the injectable drug as an acutetherapy versus prophylazis,-basa R&D versusclinical studies, manufacturing zpaenst,distribution and promotion expenditures. -- Lyphomed commenced its support of development ofpentamidine for PCP prophylaxis in 1984. The initialfunding was in support of preclinical research byDrs. Montgomery and Dabs. Throughout 1985-1988 andcontinuing into 1989, Lyphomed has provided a stream offunds to other investigators, in addition to thecontinued support of Drs. Montgomery and Debs. Thefunds have been used to support both PCP prophylaxis andtreatment trials with the aerosol formulation, as wellas the technological development of new deliverysystems, safer and more effective analogues, andimproved drug formulations. The entire pentamidine re,:earch and developmentprogram is continuing. Additional research to be fundedby Lyphomed includes post-marketing studiee required by the FDA such as additional large-scale primary andsecondary prophylaxis trials, long-term animal aerosoltoxicity studies, animal teratology studies, two-yearcarcinogenicity studies, and other studies. Theexpenses to date for all pentamidine studies areestimated at $23 million. The FDA required post-marketing studies are estimated to cost at least anadditional $15-S20 million over a period of at least3 years. Also, the company is supporting a pediatrictrial of inhaled pentamidine and supporting 51% of anumber of NIH aerosol trials in AIDS patients. The total cost to be borne by Lyphomed isenormous and will be ongoing over the next 3-5 years.This expense extends beyond the period of marketprotection provided by the Orphan Drug Act exclusivity,which for all practical purposes expires in October 1991-- XA., in less than two years. Although Lyphomed hasseven years of exclusivity for aerosol prophylaxis(June 15, 1989 thru June 15, 1996), once injectablepentamidine becomes available for generic marketing inOctober 1991, the company in effect loses nearly fiveyears of this orphan drug \"exclusivity.\" QUUSTION 9. What messagas and/or commitments were transmitted toaeach or all-of the companies by the \"communities\" mostinterested in the rapid development of an effective PCPprophylaxis * AIDS Researchers and clinicians? 5 Regulatory officials?* Community leaders and activists? Soa were these messages sent and received -- is there apaper trail? Many AfDS researchers and clinicians, regulatoryofficials, community leaders, and AIDS activists, cameto know of Lyphomed as a result of the company's earlyleadership and involvement in the AIDS crisis. Lyphomedwas the first company to fund community based researchnationwide, particularly in the key health are centerstreating AIDS patients in New York and San Francisco. Astudy funded by Lyphomed and performed by a SanFrancisco based community research group and othercommunity physicians formed the basis of Lyphomed's NewDrug Application for the use of aerosol pentamidine inPCP prevention.661 The message and commitment from each group noted above was implicit -- all would work together to obtainthe final goal, evidence of the optimum use ofpentamidins for PCP prophylaxis and FDA approval of thatuse. The paper trail that exists is the product of that commitment -- the completed clinical studies, andultimately, the full approval by the FDA of Lyphomed's New Drug Application for aerosol prophylaxis. CHRONOLOGY OF LYPHOED WITH PENTAfIDINE 1983 Rhone-Poulenc stops supply of injectable pentamidine to U.S. market. CDC seeks domestic manufacturer for the drug.

Plase feel free to call with anyadditional questions you may have. Sincerely, Donald 0. Beers Enclosures664 PLyph=We Bran Tamb November 17, 1989 Frank S. Young, M.D., Ph.D. Comlissioner of rood & Drugs Food and Drug Unapproved Pentasidine Dear Dr. Young: It has now been over a month since I wrote to you on October 5, 1989, expressing Lyphomed's grave concern about reports of imports of illegal pentanidine. In an October 16, 1989 issue of F-D-C Reports, a PWA Health Group spokesman is quoted as saying that the group will continue providing the drug until the need disappears. In addition, this spokesman is reported to have said that representatives of the Health Group 'have spoken to FDA officials 'on a regular basis' and they have reeaived 'no indication as yet Ifrom the Agencyl that there is a problem' regarding the Group's importation practices. , Z tur knowledge, the FDA has made no public statement to conflict with that confident assurance that the law against illegal importation will not be enforced. In my October 5 letter, I asked for an opportunity to mast with you if FDA were going to change its policy with respect to the importation of unapproved versions of approved drugs. The Agency's inaction has had the de facto effect of changing its policy. we are beinglnformad by our sales representatives that pentamidine from unapproved foreign sources is widespread and is becoming increasingly available in the market and that'customers are being openly solicited for purchases of unapproved imported pentamidine. There will, in time, Isw'Itably be a substantial \"black -market' Ir pentamidinsa and other important U.S. drugs that can We bought abroad at prices lower than those charged in this country. Extension of a black market to include unsafe and inefficacious versions of drugs is also inevitable. The safeguards inherent in FDA review of manufacturing and labeling of approved products obvieusly do not apply to black market drugs. The risks to VAtueste ftm an FDA abdication of its responsibilities ta this *eao age, we believe, substantial. We are requesting an immediate meeting to discuss the serious issues involving the policy of allowing import into the United States of unapproved foreign version of drugs approved by the United States FDA. These foreign drugs are marketed at lower prices by foreign companies that do not conduct or bear the expense of research and regulatory coasts associated with obtaining approval in this country. As you know, .many millions of dollars were requiredto be expended by LyphoMed to obtain United States approval of aerosolised pentamidine for prophylaxis of PCP. In addition, the FDA required major post-approval trials that will cost many more millions of dollars. That Money must, of course, com from somewhere. It must be provided from sales of the drug. Lyphomed is now feeling the impact of illicit pentamidine in lost sales revenue.665 It is apparently being argued by some that the importation of unapproved versions for FDA-approved products should be permitted because it will have the effect of lowering the price of the American product. More recently, it is argued that enforcement of the law prohibiting such imports should be deferred so that1some AIDS activists can threaten to increase (or resume ) imports if they are not satisfied with the indigent program funded by Lyphomed. This concept, that the law and law-enforcement is a bargaining chip to be utilized or withheld in this type of economic negotiation by activists is very troubling and is one that, we are certain, you would not endorse. The FDA has, of course, traditionally not involved itself in such economic bargaining at all. In any case, if, by doing nothing, the FDA is perceived as signaling its strong support for the importation of unapproved foreign versions of FDA-approved drugs, either in 'personal ue' amounts or in larger amounts, the Agency will have made an important change in policy that will continue to have disastrous widespread effects. As you know, some promising AIDS drugs are not being developed by pharmaceutical companies because of, among other factors,the very unpleasant and intimidating political climate surrounding any AIDS pharmaceutical product. A policy oftolerating illegal imports that compete with approved U.S. AIDS drugs adds to the disincentive to AIDS research. The practical effects of inaction are, in any case, already extending beyond AIDS drugs. We have been informed by AIDS activists themselves that FDAa non-enforcement of the law in the face of pressure by some activists has already led to the importation of a variety of drugs that may be purchased more cheaply abroad. We have always been impressed by the fairness and judgment with which FDA has dealt with the scientific and medical decisions that are a pert of the drug approval process. The rood and Drug Administration has, of course, a second related role -the enforcement of the laws that Congress has assigned it to enforce. The Agency has always earned the respect of those it regulates for its willingness to enforce those laws vigorously, without fear or favoritism. we must now ask that the FDA exercise its traditional leadership in law enforcement with respect to illegal imports of pentamidine. If the Agency is not prepared to do so, I renew my request for an opportunity to meet with you to discuss the seriousness of the effects of the Agency's continued inaction not only on our company but on the U.S. pharmaceutical industry in general and, in perticular, on the hopes we all have for the research and development of pharmaceuticals that will respond to the AIDS crisis. If you believe it would be appropriate, we would also be pleased to mat with Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason. Sincerely, DriPa~n Ta bi Senior Vice President & General manager Ethical Pharmaceutical Division eel Dr. Louis W. Sullivan Dr. Jams 0. Mason I We understand that representatives of some individual involved with this issue have promised to suspend their illegal imports while they decide whether they are satisfied with the Lyphomed indigent program. It is unclear whether any spokesperson could expect to represent all of those involved in illegal imports on this issue. In any case, the reports we receive do not reflect any such suspension.666 Brian Tambi Senir, Vice President & General ManagerEthil Phta cuticcl DMsiin November 29, 1989 Senator David Pryor Chairman, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Russell Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510-0402 Dear Senator Pryor: In a hearing before the Senate Special Committee on Aging on November 16, 1989 concerning prescription drug prices, statements and allegations were made about Lyphomed and its drug product pentamidine to which Lyphomed would like to respond in this letter. At the hearing, you stated that the hearing record would remain open for submissions during a ten-day period following the close of the hearing. In a discussion with the Committee staff, we were told that, in light of the intervening holiday, a submission received by December 1 would be timely. Accordingly, we respectfully request that this letter and its attachments be included in the hearing record. Lyphomed would like to respond to the following seven issues that were raised at the November 16, 1989 hearing: 1. the illegal importation into the United States of unapproved pentamidine; 2. the profitability of orphan drugs; 3. the justification for price increases for pentamidine; 4. the Lyphomed indigent program; 5. the cost of nebulizers and of pentamidine administration; 6. European sources of pentamidine and their prices; and 7. Lyphomed's upcoming meeting with representatives of AIDS activist groups. I. ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF UNAPPROVED PENTAMIDINE At the hearing on November 16, Derek Nodel testified concerning the illegal importation of unapproved pentamidine. (Section 301(d) and 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a), prohibit the import of unapproved drugs.) It is well known that Mr. Hodel is a major proponent of such illegal imports. Lyphomed has indeed requested that FDA stop the illegal import of unapproved pentamidine. It is clear that the law does not permit such imports and Lyphomed is merely insisting on the proper enforcement of existing law in this area. We are enclosing herein copies of two letters that Lyphomed has sent to FDA Commissioner Young which address this problem (see Attachments 1 and 2).,OF Lyphoffied667 If FDA does not enforce the law to prohibit these illegal imports of unapproved new drugs, it is predictable that a substantial commercial black market will develop in this country. Such a black market can present the kind of health risks discussed below (see issue 6). Moreover, the basis for pharmaceutical innovation in the United States will be severely undercut if unapproved foreign versions of U.S. drugs approved by FDA are permitted to enter the country. Pentasidine presents an excellent example of the relationship between a country's policy toward drug costs and research. In 1984, Rhone- Poulenc's British subsidiary May a Baker refused to continue to supply the pentamidine needed to treat AIDS patients in the United States, apparently because the market was considered to be too small. We understand that many U.S. pharmaceutical companies also declined requests by the CDC to formulate, manufacture and supply the drug. According to authentic sources, a real medical emergency' had developed at the time. At the urging of the Centers for Disease Control, Lyphomed agreed to formulate and manufacture pentamidine for government distribtution and later accepted responsibility to seek FDA approval and supply pentamidine commercially. At that time pentamidine was used only as an injectable product to treat Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia (IPCP). Subsequently, there was a great need to fund very expensive research to determine whether pentamidine might have an important new use -- as an aerosol product to prevent PCP. United States law had given Lyph m arket exclusivity for the injectable version of the product and the right to set the price of its drug in the market. Lyphomed established the price of pentamidine in this country in order to pay for the need to establish a special physician sales force, a special marketing group and, since 1984, the escalating high costs of needed research. Ultimately, based on the results of five years of testing followed by nationwide clintcal research, FDA concluded that aerosol pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis was safe and effective. It approved this new indication on June 15, 1989, after obtaining an agreement from Lyphomed to fund another estimated $15-20 million in post-approval trials over the next three to four years. may & Baker, in the meantime, had funded no meaningful clinical trials (and may not have funded any trials at all) of aerosol pentasidine for prophylaxis. Its price remained low in Great Britain, where prices are controlled by the government, and its research effort was marginal to none. Thus, its research cost was also marginal. If Lyphosed had adopted (or had been required by government price regulation to adopt) the passive role in drug development adopted by gay & Baker -- i.e., if Lyphosed had refused to fund research and had declined to pay the cost of educating physicians about the safe use of the drug -- Lyphomed's price could be as low as may & Baker's price is today. But no one would have produced the significant evidence that aerosol penta idine, if used properly, can prevet PCP The life-extending benefits of aerosol pentamidine and the substantial cost savings to the U.S. Federal and State Governments, third party insurance institutions and the public from avoiding PCP would have been lost.668 If the FDA does not enforce the law against import of cheaper unapproved foreign drugs from abroad, those importations may eventually have the effect of imposing European price controls on the American market. The ability of pharmaceutical companies to pay for needed research will be profoundly affected by that development. Moreover, that effect will not be the result of a considered decision by the Congress that the laws should be changed. It will, rather, be the product of the willingness of some to ignore the law and the unwillingness of the Executive Branch to take effective action to assure that the law is obeyed. We believe that the FDA must take appropriate action under the current statutory regime to stop the illegal importation of drugs and to discourage those who circumvent the law. II. THE PROFITABILITY OF ORPHAN DRUGS In his testimony on November 16, Mr. Hodel stated that Congress, while enacting exclusivity for orphan drugs, intended that orphan drugs not be profitable. Mr. Hodel neglected to mention, however, that Ccngress well understood that seven years of marketing exclusivity meant potentially higher prices for the drugs approved under the Orphan Drug Act as well as greater and more predictable returns on investment to the company obtaining orphan drug approval. H.R. Rep. 153, 99 Cong., 1st Sess. at 6-7, reprinted in 1985 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 306. That was exactly the.point of exclusivity -- providing the benefit of these market forces to encourage the pursuit of an important social goal such as orphan drug research and development. Exclusivity would, of course, be unnecessary if Congress did not contemplate that there would be potential profit in the sale of the drug. If there were no potential profit, no competitor would wish to share the market for the orphan drug. If no competitor wished to share the market, exclusivity would be unnecessary. In this way, the exclusivity of the Orphan Drug Act is analogous to the patent laws, which limit competition and present a potential for higher prices for a period of time for certain products. Patents and periods of exclusivity have proven to be sound national policy in that they encourage research concerning, and the development of, new products and new indications for existing products. III. EXPLANATION OF LYPHOMED'S PENTAMIDINE PRICE In colloquy, Mr. Hodel stated that Lyphomed has not provided a justification to AIDS groups for the price increase of pentamidine. This statement by Mr. Hodel is not accurate. In recent months, Lyphomed has met with a number of persons concerned with the AIDS crisis to discuss the costs that necessitated the rise in pentamidine's price, costs of educational programs for physicians in the use of pentamidine and research and development costs for aerosol pentamidine. In addition, Lyphomed publicly testified before Congress in 1988, providing a complete explanation of the development of the pentamidine price. Note that the price of pentamidine has remained constant since August 1987. We have also enclosed a letter that was recently sent to Terry Beirn of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources which discusses, among 31i- 5 ' aiO 1 other issues, the price of pentamidine (seeAttachment 3).669 IV. THE LYPHOMED INDIGENT PROGRAM Mr. Hodel referred to the Lyphomed indigent program as a 'media ploy.' His characterization is completely inaccurate. For many years, Lyphomed has been supplying pentamidine at no charge to a large number of patients under various non-regulatory physician protocols, as well as for regulatory clinical testing of the drug for use in prophylaxis and in PCP treatment. Upon FDA approval of the drug, Lyphomed announced a post-approval indigent program. As a-result of discussions with many advisors, Lyphomed devised an innovative indigent program, the first of its kind in that it was designed to work with local nonprofit clinics at the community level in administering a program to distribute free pentamidine. Mr. Hodel also stated at the November 16 hearing that his group was not aware of any distribution of pentamidine to non-profit community health centers under the Lyphomed indigent program. In fact, since the program was implemented-.on October 15, 1989, close to three hundredletters introducing the program have been sent to not-for-profit~community based groups. Of these, approximately 50 have responded and 27 have qualified and received a total of over 2,500 free vials of pentamidine. Distribution has been nationwide. Furthermore, additional agreements with other community-based units nationwide are being processed. We wish to emphasize that this program was conceived, designed and implemented at the sole initiative of Lyphomed and not as a response to criticism. V. THE COST OF NEBULIZERS AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION At the November '6lhaaring,\"Mr. Hodel discussed an HIV positive patientk who was advised by medical professionals to purchase \"a two hundred dollar\" nebulizer in order to administer aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis to herself in her home. The nebulizer that is recommended in the -labeling of Lyphomed's aerosol pentamidine product, the Respirgard II, in fact costs approximately $8. We enclose for inclusion in the record (see Attachment 4) a copy of a survey performed by a group called \"Patient Advocates for Necessary Treatment\" relating to the physician and health ..care provider costs associated with administration of pentamidine for prophylaxis in San Francisco. The drug is sold at the same price to each provider and the Respirgard nebulizer cost is, as stated, relatively low. We do not know why the additional costs for -administration of the drug are, in some cases, so high. VI. EUROPEAN SOURCES OF PENTAMIDINE AND THEIR PRICES At the November 16 hearing it was suggested that the pentamidine product from overseas is equivalent to Lyphomed's approved pentamidine product. There is really no proof to support that assertion. The Lyphomed&pentamidine product, in order to be approved by FDA,. has been required to meet * strict manufacturing and controls standards to ensure its safety, efficacy, purity, potency and 31-352 0 -90 -22670 e, Lyphomed Senator David Pryor November 29, 1989 Page 8 stability. Every vial of pentamidine thatLyphomed produces must meet those exacting standards. The foreign product has not beenrequired to meet those same FDA standards andhas not been submitted for evaluation andapproval of the FDA. As you know, each drug manufacturer is required by U.S. law to satisfy applicable requirements to obtain FDA approval for its product, eventhough another company's version of the drug mayhave been approved previously. When drugs areimported without any FDA review, one cannot simply assume that the foreign manufacturer's product will be as safe or effective for itsintended use as the FDA-approved drug. FDAreview requirements are not mere technicalities. They serve a very important function -- toensure each drug's safety and efficacy. Moreover, Lyphomed has evidence that some of theillegally imported pentamidine is in bulk powderform to be compounded by local pharmacists andothers, under potentially unsterile conditions, into a finished drug product. Such unsterilecompounding can result in an unsafe and sub-therapeutic drug product reaching patients and thereby posing a significant health risk.Lyphomed has been able to obtain an injunctionfrom a U.S. District Court in Texas to prohibit one such company from selling unapproved bulkpentamidine. (We enclose, as Attachment 5, acopy of an affidavit filed in that case addressing the health risk associated with compounding of bulk pentamidine.) However, Lyphomed cannot, as a practical matter, initiateseparate court actions against all illegalimporters; Rather, the law must be enforced byFDA to prevent the illegal imports in the firstinstance. With respect to European drug prices, you heardat the November 16 hearing from two representatives of a Belgian consumer group thatthe reasons for lower pharmaceutical prices in671 e, Lyphomed Senator David Pryor -November 29, 1989 Page 9 Europe are that European governments fix theprices of pharmaceuticals and attempt torestrict the prescribing practices of physiciansto those drugs that are approved forreimbursement by the government. In contrast,we in the United States have traditionally operated in a free enterprise system which.discourages such governmental price controls. VII. LYPHOMED MEETING WITH AIDS ACTIVISTS As Mr. Hodel mentioned at the November 16hearing, Lyphomed has agreed to meet withrepresentatives of the AIDS activist communityin order to continue to discuss issues relatedto pentamidine. Lyphomed has spent much timeand human resources in the last several monthsmeeting with people concerned about AIDS in NewYork City and San Francisco and will continue,in the upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. tobe receptive to engaging in a dialogue aboutpentamidine. We trust that these responses will help to clarify theinformation that was presented by Mr. Hodel at theNovember 16 hearing. It was suggested at the hearingthat Lyphomed, which has devoted so much of its humanresources and which has expended and is continuing toexpend so much of its limited capital to work with-community and other institutional researchers todevelop aerosol pentamidine, pentamidine technologies for AIDS, has \"sense of socialresponsibility.\" That suggestion was, we believe youwill agree, uninformed and unfair.

I have been the principal investigator or co- investigator in many of the clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of aerosolized pentamidine. In addition, I am the principal investigator in clinical research sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (\"NIAID\") and LyphoMed, Incorporated (\"LyphoMed\") to study the safety and effectiveness of aerosolized pentanidine. 3. I have two investigational now drug applications under my name at the Food and Drug Administration, both concerning pentamidine salts. 4. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington in 1975 and an M;D. from the University of Washington in 1979. 5. I completed my internship and residency in Internal Medicine at the University of Washington from 1979-1982. From 1982-83, I was a Pulmonary Research Fellow at the University of Washington and from 1983-85 I was a Chest Fellow at the University of California in San Francisco.673 6. I am Board Certified in Internal Medicine and Pulmonary Diseases and am a Diplomate of the National Board of Medical Examiners. I hold active licenses for the practice of medicine in the State of Washington, California, and New York. 7. From 1985 through November 1988, I served on the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco and the Cardiovascular Research Institute, Chest Service, San Francisco General Hospital. 8. I serve as a reviewer for the Journal of the Am rican Medical Association, The European Respiratorv JoIurnaj, the journal entitled Chest, the journal AIDS, and the Journal of Clinical Investigation. 9. I am a member of the Pneumocvstis carinii Subcommittee of the Opportunistic Infections Committee of the AIDS evaluation and treatment evaluation units of the NIAID. I am a member of the Public Health Service Task Force on Anti-Pneumocystis Prophylaxis for Patients Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus. 10. I have presented papers and lectures to various professional organizations including the American Thoracic Society, American College of Chest Physicians, Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, and the 1988 International Conference on AIDS. 1.1. I am the author or co-author of more than 25 *t published articles and more than 20 published abstracts relating to pulmonary medicine, particularly the treatment of AIDS patients and the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (\"PCP\"). A more detailed description of-my professional qualifications and a list of my publications is contained in my Curriculum Vitae, which is attached. 12. Because of my education, training and experience, I amcknowledgeable about the treatment of AIDS patients, particularly those suffering from puluonary diseases such as PCP, and treatment of those patients with pentamidine isethionate. 13. PCP is a severely debilitating pneumonia in which lung tissue is destroyed, at a particularly rapid pace in immunocompromised patients such as those with674 AIDS, producing an inability to breathe and supply oxygen to the body tissues, and, if not appropriately treated, finally death. 14. I have been asked to address the potential problems that may be associated with the administration of pentamidine that has been compounded by pharmacists from bulk pentamidine. Ethical drug manufacturing requires multiple steps to ensure quality, purity, and sterility. Compounding in a pharmacy, not subject to those safeguards, may result in administration of drugs that contain impurities, degradation products, or microbial contaminants. 15. One must be particularly concerned about the possibility of microbial contamination in products compounded by pharmacists. open air measurement of bulk drug on scales allows a strong probability of microbial contamination. The subsequent dissolving of the drug in a water solution for later use increases the danger. Bacteria can grow creating a concentrated solution of bacteria in the drug in a matter of hours. 16. Heat sterilization of pentamidine water solution is not possible because heat would destroy the drug and the remains of dead bacteria can still cause severe asthma-like reactions when inhaled or shock when injected. Other methods of sterilization, such as filtering, are not foolproof when performed by small scale operations. They require laminar flow hoods and large sterile laboratories. 17. There are two areas of concern using bulk drug pentamidine isethionate because there are two routes of administration of the drug, intravenously and by aerosol. In either case, the drug will be administered most often to patients with AIDS or with pre-AIDS conditions. These patients are particularly vulnerable to the risks from contaminated drug because their immune systems are compromised by their disease. 18. Administration of pentamidine by injection to treat PCP exposes the patient to the risk of sometimes severe side effects associated with systemic circulation of the drug. That is a risk that is justified by the benefit, i._.. clearing of the infection, which can be fatal if left untreated. If the675 pentanidine injected into the patient contains impurities, the patient is placed at.additional risk from the unknown effects of the impurities, with no corresponding benefits. There is no justification for exposing these often very sick patients to that additional risk. 19. If the pentamidine is not sterile, if it carries with it some infectious agent, its administration to AIDS patients suffering a bout of PCP could well be fatal. Because an AIDS patient has a severely debilitated immune system, the patient lacks the ability to fight off any infection that might be introduced by the non-sterile product. 20. The effect on humans of unpure pentamidine given by the aerosol route is just not known. No deliberate testing has been done. However, it is quite conceivable that impurities could cause asthma-like symptoms or progressive lung scarring. 21. The effect of bacterial contamination on aerosol preparations is well known. Aerosol-borne lung infection has been well described. -In the early 1970s, many-deaths were attributedrto contaminated respiratory care eqmipment-that led to the direct innoculation of bacteria into the lungs of patients. 22. Although Pneumocystis carinii is the most common pneumonia in AIDS patients, typical bacterial pneumonia. also occur frequently if the immune system is severely damaged. These bacterial pneumonias can cause great suffering and can in fact be fatal to AIDS patients. 23. One of the common bacterial pneumonias caused by contaminated equipment in the past is caused by pseudomonas, a bacteria that can grow easily in watery alone, the substance used to dissolve pentamidine. Furthermore, pentamidine does not have any ability to kill pseudomonas. 24. The use of impure compounded pentamidine isethionate is a true menace to AIDS patients. To turn -a breakthrough AIDS drug into a potential threat to the health of the user is a perverse act.676 25. From my experience in treating AIDS patients, I understand that information is communicated very rapidly in that patient group by an extensive network of informal and formal communications. Information received by patients through this network can often influence the beliefs of AIDS patients, irrespective of information received from physicians. If one patient suffers an adverse event from compounded pentamidine, and other patients, upon hearing through this network that this drug may be harmful, refuse to use pentauidine, thousands will die needlessly and painfully, choking to death from pneumonia. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. A.

In fact, I was persuaded byyour testimony to write the attached letter to the Federal Foodand Drug Administration (FDA), seeking their analysis of aspecific proposal that would help to make a lower priced-aerosolized pentamidine product available in the U.S. market. Iwould also like to know your feelings about the proposal I madeto the FDA. For your information, I have also enclosed copies of the Committee staff reports from both the July 18, 1989 hearing on this subject, and the November 16 hearing just concluded. I hope you find this information as helpful and interesting as yours was for the Committee and its staff.

Sincerely, David Pryor Chairman Enclosures DP:dgs685 n -met,, SASOOLASS. SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING WASHINGTON, DC 205104400 December 8, 1989 The Honorable Frank E. Young, M.D. Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration Room 14-71 Parklawn Building Rockville, MD 20857 Dear Dr. Young: I am writing to request your analysis and advice regarding a legislative proposal that would facilitate the approval of lowerpriced prescription drug products for orphan, diseases. As you know, the Federal Food and Drug Administration maydesignate a prescription drug as an orphan' drug, and, concomitant with approval of the drug for U.S. marketing, grantexclusive marketing rights to the manufacturer of that productfor a period of seven years. Observers of the prescription drug industry have given Congress high marks for granting FDA thisauthority, which is credited with spurring the development of badly-needed new drugs for small populations of Americans who would otherwise receive less safe or less efficacious treatment. During the course of hearings by this Committee aimed atfinding solutions to the rapidly escalating cost of prescription drugs, I learned that the FDA has granted 'orphan, drugstatus for pentamidine, manufactured by Lyphomed, for marketing in an aerosolized form if it is used in a specific nebulizer device. Another firm, Fisons, Inc., has reportedly developed adifferent nebulizer technology for the identical use. I furtherunderstand that the aerosolized Fisons drug product, under the terms of the Orphan Drug Act, cannot be marketed for the same use in the United States until the period of exclusivity granted Lyphomed has expired. It is also my understanding that FDA, even after manyclinical trials involving both products, has received no data demonstrating that either drug product is superior to the other in terms of safety or efficacy for the approved aerosolized use. However, the 'FisoNeb' nebulizer achieves this apparentlyequivalent effect while using only about 40% as much pentamidineper month of treatment as the nebulizer approved foradministration of the Lyphomed product. In view of the highcost of pentamidine treatment, Fisons' technology represents avery significant cost saving for HIV-infected people. I am concerned that Congress has inadvertently created asituation in which a badly needed product, associated with a more efficient, cost-saving delivery system, may be prevented from competing in the U.S. market. At the same time, it seemsclear that Lyphomed has abused its protection from competition686 The Honorable Frank E. Young, M.D. Page 2 under the law, exploiting the opportunities presented by the Orphan Drug Act to raise its price for pentamidine by almost 400% since 1984. It appears this situation cannot be resolved under the narrow terms of current law. FDA is not authorized by the Act to approve a second firm's request to market an \"orphan\" drug for an identical medical purpose, even when presented with evidence of advantages resulting from a substantially different drug delivery system. Therefore, I would be grateful to receive FDA's perspective on a technical change to the Orphan Drug Act which would authorize FDA to approve a second manufacturer's orphan drug for a period of \"shared\" (possibly coterminous) exclusivity with the first approved orphan product, when it is approved for the same use in conjunction with a delivery system of substantially superior safety, efficacy, or lower cost to the patient/user. A firm which-violated the terms of their grant of shared' exclusivity under this provision -- for example, by-raising the price of their product so the substantial cost advantage which earned them shared' exclusivity disappeared -- could have their -shared, exclusivity privilege revoked by FDA. This approach is intended to preserve the incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, while balancing them with the virtues of competition under circumstances where another firm has taken a risk and has developed a clearly superior technology. Moreover, this incremental approach to documented abuses of the Orphan Drug Act is consistent with this February 1989 recommendation of the National Commission on Orphan Diseases: \"...the Commission is very concerned that the potential for abuse of the incentives in the Orphan Drug Act will threaten its future. The Commission therefore urges that if abuses are clearly documented, Congress consider limited corrective legislation.\" I would appreciate receiving the Agency's response by the end of January, 1990. Please have your staff contact David Schulke at 224-5364 to discuss this proposal. Sincerely, David Pryor Chairman DP:dgs687 Bruce Montgomery, M.D. 921 Arlington Road Redwood City, CA 94062 January 15, 1990 Senator David Pryor chairman, U.S. Senate Special Committee on AgingRussell Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510-0402 Dear Senator Pryor: I am writing to you to discuss the drugpentamidine and to comment on the inaccurate data whichsupporters of the Fisons Corporation (\"Fisons\") haveapparently presented to you and your staff concerningtheir method of administering aerosol pentamidine. Ihave been involved in the research and development ofpentamidine for 6 years. I was one of the principalinvestigators in the pentamidine clinical trial thatresulted in FDA aerosolized pentamidine forprophylaxis against Pneumocvstis carinii pneumonia (\"PCP') on June 15, 1989. In addition, I have lectured on the research and development of aerosolizedpentamidine to diverse audiences in both the UnitedStates and Canada. I have had an opportunity to review two charts(copies enclosed) apparently provided by supporters of -Fisons to your staff, the presentation by Fisons to the FDA Antiviral Drug Products Advisory Committee on May 1, 1989, the written submission by Fisons to the PublicHealth Service task force, and presentations of Fisonsdata at scientific meetings and in the medicalliterature. From this review, I have discoveredmischaracterizations in the charts presented to you thatmisrepresent the Fisons dosage regimen and its nebulizer (FISONeb) as therapeutically superior to the dosageregimen approved for Lyphomed which uses the Marquestnebulizer (Respirgard II). In reality, the Fisonsregimen and nebulizer are not therapeutically superiorto the Lyphomed regimen and nebulizer in any way and are in fact very unlikely to be as effective in preventing PCP. As a clinical investigator wbo is very close tothe development of pentamidine and very interested inthe treatment of AIDS patients, I felt an obligation towrite to you to correct the record with respect to theFisons data. All of the Fisons and Lyphomed pentamidine data were reviewed and evaluated in the spring of 1989 by aselect committee of the U.S. Public Health Service convened by Dr. Anthony Fauci of NIH and chaired by Dr. Henry Masur of NIH. That committee includedclinical investigators involved in the Fisons trials,experts from the FDA, and other experts in the field. In a report published in the June 16, 1989 Morbidity andMortality Weekly Report (copy enclosed), this committeeconcluded that the only pentamidine regimen withestablished efficacy is 300 mg every 4 weeks deliveredby the Respirgard II (i.e., the Lyphomed regimen). In aconsensus statement by the committee, undisputed by theFisons clinical investigators, it was stated that therewas insufficient data to recommend any other nebulizer regimen. No new clinical data supporting the Fisons regimen have been presented to change that evaluationsince the committee's report was issued.688 Fisons has presented no data from human beings to establish the efficiency of pentamidine delivery to the lungs by the FISONeb nebulizer. The data Fisons has presented to you on the deposition of pentamidine in the lungs through the FISONeb is based on in vitro laboratory tests of their nebulizer. Such in vitro data cannot, of course, be extrapolated legitimately to human beings. Fisons simply does not know whether the FISONeb produces acceptable levels of pentamidine in the lungs of AIDS patients. In contrast, the.nebulizer used with the Lyphomed product has been tested in a human clinical trial which measured the levels of pentamidine in the lung after aerosolization by the Respirgard II. In this clinical study, the Respirgard II nebulizer produced extremely high pentamidine levels in the alveoli (air sacs within the lung) when measured directly. Montgomery, A.B. et al., \"Selective Delivery of Pentamidine to the Lung by Aerosol\", Am. Rev. Resoir. Dis., Vol. 137, pp. 477-478 (1988) (copy enclosed). The Fisons nebulizer produces a large particle size.whichdis more likely to irritate the respiratory passages (leading to bronchospasm) and thereby to reduce the amount of pentamidine available to the lung tissue. Although Fisons has presented data to you that the MMAD (mass-median aerodynamic diameter) (i.e., the size relative to which half of the particles are larger and half are smaller) of its nebulizer particles ranges from 2.3 to 4.6 microns, in reality the particle size MMAD for the FISONeb nebulizer, as reported in several articles from the medical literature and in the Fisons package insert, is in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 microns.1 In contrast, the Respirgard II has an MMAD of 1 to 1.5 microns. Montgomery, A.B. et al., \"Selective Delivery of Pentamidine to the Lung by Aerosol\", AM. Rev. Resoir. Diff., Vol. 137, pp. 477-478 (1988) The smaller size of the particles associated with aerosolization of the Lyphomed pentamidine product is important because it permits more drug to reach the site of action in the lung without irritation to the lung tissue.2 1 For example, see Corkery, K.J., Luce, J.M., and R-espirator Care, Vol. 33, No. 8, pp. 676-685 (August 1988) and Smith, D. et-al.; Comparison of Nebulizer Efficiency for Aerosolizing -Pentamidine\", Abstract T.B.P. 64, V International .Conference on AIDS, Montreal, Canada, June 4-9, 1989 .(copies enclosed). There is one article in the medical literature which suggests the MMAD of the FISONeb to be 2.5 microns. Smaldone, G.C. et al., \"Characteristics of AIDS-Related Aerosol Medicine, Vol. 1, No:.52, pp. 113-26, (1988) (copy enclosed). This assessment of particle size has been widely recognized as flawed because of an error in the technique of measurement used by Smaldone. In brief, the measuring device used by Smaldone eliminated larger particles from the measurement, as a result of a design defect, and left only the smaller size particles to be measured. This.skewed the MMAD measurement to a low value, one which has never been replicated by other investigators who have measured the particle size (MMAD) of the FISONeb. In fact, using a standard method, in the same paper, Smaldone presented a particle size measurement (MMAD) of greater than 5.0 microns for the FISONeb. 2 It should also be noted that the pentamidine drugparticles become larger once they reach the lung tissue because pentezidine molecules expand in a humid environment such as the lung (termed a 'hygroscopic\" effect). The FISONeb particles, which are already approximetely tour times larger then the Respirgard IIparticles, will thus become even larger in the lung, resulting in additional airway irritation and reduced _ effectiveness. __ ___689 The chart submitted to your staff on nebulizerefficiency is inaccurate. Data from the Lyphomed NDAfor aerosolized pentamidine showed the Respirgard IInebulizer to 10-11%, not 3% assuggested by Fisons. The Smaldone article, cited abovein footnote 1, purports to establish an efficiency forthe FISONeb nebulizer of 16% and an efficiency for theRespirgard II of 4.6%. These efficiency figures in theSmaldone article are not accurate as a direct-comparisonbecause of a failure to consider and correct for thetime of administration which differs between the twonebulizers. The FISONeb delivers all its drug productin a period of 20 minutes whereas the Respirgard IIdelivers its complete dosage in approximately 40minutes3.Smaldone measured the efficiency of theRespirgard II in 20 minutes as 4.6%; in 40 minutes, thatefficiency would be doubled to 9.2%. And, although theFISONeb has an efficiency of 16% in the 20 minutes thatit takes to finish its delivery, one can see from thegraph submitted by Fisons (enclosure) that at least halfof the particles generated by the FISONeb do not fall inthe range of alveolar deposition. Correcting for thisreduces the FISONeb efficiency by half, to a figure of8%. In contrast, the Respirgard II, by virtue of itssuperior design, produces almost all of its particles inthe range of alveolar deposition so the 9.2% efficiencyfigure need not be corrected in this way. In summary, when one compares the efficiency of the Respirgard IIwith the FISONeb, correcting for the time it takes foreach to deliver its full dose of drug and the amountthat reaches the lung, FISONeb has an efficiency ofapproximately 8% and Respirgard II an efficiency ofapproximately 9.2%. A nebulizer that delivers its product in a lesseramount of time does not necessarily result in a clinicaladvantage. What counts is the amount of drug thatreaches the site of action. More drug reaches the lungwith the Respirgard II in 40 minutes, as a result of itssmaller particle size, than the amount that reaches thelung in 20 minutes with the FISONeb. In fact, a longeradministration time for nebulized particles into thelung may be preferable because it results in lessirritation as the lung tissue has a longer period oftime to react to the bombardment of nebulized particles. Ultimately, this type of comparison of nebulizerefficiency only provides a theoretical basis forpredicting what might occur. Only clinical trials, inwhich human beings utilize the drug, can provide hardevidence of effectiveness. Those trials have, ofcourse, been done on the Lyphomed regimen and have shownits effectiveness. 3The period of approximately 40 minutes for thenebulizer chamber of the Respirgard II to be emptied wasdetermined in clinical trial use for the prophylaxis ofpatients and is referenced in the approved labeling forLyphomed's product NebuPent. Smaldone's suggestion thatthe use of the Respirgard II is limited to 20 minutes bypatient fatigue is apparently based on its use bypatients in a study for the treatment of acutepneumonia, patients who were weakened by the presence ofan acute respiratory disease. Accordingly, to validlycompare the efficiency of nebulizer emptying between theRespirgard II and FISONeb, the standard emptying times --40 minutes for the Respirgard II and 20 minutes forthe FISONeb -- must be used..690 A report in The Pink Sheet (F-D-C Reports,September 25, 1989), which discussed the Fisons dose- ranging study at Northwestern University, stated that\"(e]stimates for 24-week PCP-free survival were 100% inthe 60 mg group, 90% in the 120 mg group, and 79% in the5 mg group.\". While the fact that the 120 mg group(higher dose regimen) seems to have less effectiveness than the 60 mg group (lower dose regimen) is probablyattributable to the fact that a study of such a short duration could not provide meaningful results (seediscussion below), another real possibility is that theultrasonic nebulizer produces too much bronchospasm atthe higher dose to be effective. Bronchospasm actuallyinterferes with delivery of the drug to the air sacs of the lung. Ultimately, all of the reported Fisons data from controlled trials suffer from the same fatal deficiency-its studies as reported were too short, with no,results reported after six months. Lyphomed also sawencouraging trends at lower doses in the first six months of its own clinical trials. In fact, in ananalysis of our six-month data, we drew the erroneous conclusion that 150 mg twice a month would be superior to 300 mg once a month. Ultimately, by continuing the study over an 18-month period, we learned that the 300mg once a month dose is superior. By continuing the study through a period of 18 months, Lyphomed learnedthat most of the pneumonia relapses suffered by thesepatients in fact occurred after the point atwhichFisons terminated its study -- ji_., between the 6 to 12month periods. Fisons has not reported controlledstudies past the six-month period and therefore theFisons data are likely to be artificially positive andclinically meaningless. Any claim that the Fisons regimen and nebulizeris equivalent to the FDA-approved regimen using theRespirgard II nebulizer would have to be substantiatedby head-to-head clinical trials (i.e., clinical trials in which the two regimens are compared under equivalentcircumstances.) If, however, one seeks to compare existing clinical data, that comparison does not support the Fisons claim. One could look at participants in Lyphomed's trial who would have met the criteria forinclusion in the Fisons protocol to obtain some information about the difference in effectiveness of thetwo regimens. At the end of six months (the end of theFisons controlled trial), the equivalent participants inthe Lyphomed trial who received 300 mg once per month had approximately one half as many PCP relapses as those in the Fisons trial who received 60 mg twice a month.* Fisons' open trial also shows a much higher one year attack rate than the Lyphomed study or its open trials. Thus, the evidence that Fisons provides suggests thatFisons' dose is too low or that its nebulizer hasproblems delivering drug to the appropriate areas of thelung. I am concerned that Fisons may try to suggestthat its regimen would be cheaper by assuming unsupervised home use of its nebulizer. There aresignificant health problems associated with unsupervised home use of a nebulizer for PCP prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine treatments have shown the need for scrupulous infection control to prevent transmission of other pulmonary infections. The Fisons nebulizer lacks disposable components or an expiratory filter, thepresence of which helps to prevent the risk of transmission of infection and environmental (secondhand) exposure to exhaled pentamidine. In any case, supervision would be necessary to prevent transmission of tuberculosis and other infections to household691 Senator David Pryor January 15, 1990 Page 7 members. Patients are not likely to buy devices for one use only and, given the major expense of a single Fisons nebulizer ($350 each compared to $6 for the disposable Respirgard II), AIDS patients will undoubtedly share these Fisons nebulizers -- a grim prospect consideringthe likelihood of transmission of respiratory infections from person to person from such sharing. Further, since aerosol treatments are prolonged and time consuming, it is unlikely that compliance with treatment will be as good with any unsupervised hometreatment. Because the Fisons clinical trials are supervised in a hospital or clinic setting, it is not clear that their results would be generalizable to treatments performed at home by patients who areunsupervised. In fact, many AIDS patients are not physically able to coordinate breathing with triggeringthe nebulizer, as required by the FISONeb nebulizer. I am quite distressed that the Fisons data, aspresented to you, falsely imply that the Fisonspentamidine regimen and nebulizer could be considered as equivalent or superior in efficacy to the Lyphomed regimen which has been proven safe and effective inclinical trials. The simple truth, as demonstrated by an objective look at the data which exist to date, isthat the Fisons regimen and nebulizer are not equivalentor superior to the currently approved pentamidine formulation. The lives of AIDS patients are at stake,compelling us to take a fair look at the available data. I hope that the discussion above will assist you in that process.

The change in question would be designed specifically to benefit a British pharmaceutical company, the Fisons Corporation, by'authorizing FDA to-approve a Fisons NDA for pentamidine, despite the exclusivity granted to' Lypbomed for that drug. This request is based on theSenator!s understanding that Fisons has allegedly developed a \"clearly superiortn\u00a3echnology,\" that would allow pentamidine to Pneumomavtis carinii pneumonia (-'PCP\") -at -lower doses and thus lower cost than the dosage andnebulizer currently approved by FDA. Our submission herein will establish that the premise for Senator Pryor's proposal is unsupported by factual- data and without clinical or scientific merit. Fisons' proposed prophylaxis regimen has not been shown to be therapeutically equivalent, much less superior, to that covered by -Lyphomed's approved new drug application. Moreover, the alleged reduction of patient cost of the Fisons' drug and Fisons' nebulizer is without basis as well. A second argument by Senator Pryor for the proposed amendment tothe statute -- that Lyphomed has abused the Orphan Drug Act -- is simply false. Finally, any change to decrease or dilute marketing exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act would be, we believe, poor public policy. Any action to alter the.law to favor individual companies,. and in particular a foreign company such as Fisons, would be detrimental to the entire United States system of intellectual property rights and will have serious implications throughout'the whole U.S. pharmaceutical industry. In this letter we address each of these points. Safety and Effectiveness We have reviewed the Fisons claims with experts familiar with pentamidine prophylaxis who were present at the Fisons'presentationat the FDA Antiviral Drug Products Advisory Committee meeting on May 1, 1989. These experts have also reviewed Fisons' written submission to the Public Health Service Task Force. We feel compelled to share with you the following observations by our expert consultants concerning the Fisons data. Fisons relies, in part, on a placebo-controlled trial. In general, a placebo trial can quickly establish whether an experimental drug has activity, but unless there is complete suppression at a low, well tolerated dose, it does not answer the question of optimal dose. Indeed, Fisons has recognized and acknowledged this by conducting a dose ranging study concurrently (the results of which will be discussed in a following section). Experts whom we have consulted believe there are several shortcomings with data from even a dramatic placebo trial, shortcomings that are evident in Fisons' data:695 a. If the drug is very active, then a placebo trial will beof very short duration, which does not allow long-tarmassessment of continued efficacy and safety. Both innatural history studies before prophylaxis and in our own trials, the majority of PCP events seen do not occur until after the first six months of prophylactic therapy. Indeed, at a comparable period (at six months follow- up) in our trial we could barely discern whether the 30 mg dose was as effective as the 300 mg dose. In fact,based on those early trends, the incorrect extrapolation was made by us that 150 mg bi-weekly would be the optimaldose, in recommendations to the NIH about study designs. After 6 months prophylaxis, however, dose separationstarted to show and long-term (18 months) follow-upclearly established that 300 mg every four weeks was theoptimal dosage regimen. The Lyphomed NDA submission in November 1988 was based on a 12-month follow-up analysibof the dose-response prophylaxis study. The FDA requiredfrom Lyphomed an 18-month follow-up analysis to ensure that the superiority of 300 mg doe was establilad_ with a full year of data following the first appeerem_ of a dose response. There is no public evience tWet PLume has lI-months of patient follow-up in any study. b. If the drug is very active, even small doses noteffective in the long run will be better than the placebo in the short-term. This is the erroneous trend that Fisons' 6 month study showed. c. The strategy for testing drugs for acute treatment is very different from that for testing for prophylaxis. For acute treatment of a life-threatening condition, the maximally tolerated dose is given, and if that is ineffective it can be abandoned. If it works, then follow-up studies can elicit whether lower doses are as effective, With prophylaxis, however, there is no logic at all to giving a maximal dose (in this case that would be daily IV pentamidine dose of 4 mg/kg). Only a doseresponse study can show the optimal dose for prophylactic therapy. Although it is difficult to compare Fisons' dose-response study to Lyphomed's, some scenarios can be offered to provide perspective. If one takes a cohort of Lyphomed study participants who would have been eligible for Fisons' study, and compares our results to those of Fisons, the Fisons results at six months show a two fold greater PCP rate for their 120 mg per month in two doses then that observed in the group receiving our 300 mg single dose per month. The Fisons' open trials also shows a much higher one year attack rate than our pivotal study or our open trials. Thus; the evidence that Fisons provides suggests that its dose is too low and consequently less effective than Lyphomed's dosage regimen and/or that its nebulizer has problems delivering drug to the appropriate area of the lung. These data lead us to conclude that Fisons has Dgt shownequivalency, let alone the company's' claimed \"superiority,\" in terms of relative efficacy and safety of aerosolized pentamidinedelivered via Fisons' nebulizer as compared to Lyphomod's FDA-approved d6se and device. We note that our view on this issue was shared by the panel ofexperts convened by the National Institutes of Health to draftguidelines for PCP prophylaxis. Incidentally, that panel included Dr. Donald Armstrong, a Fisons collaborator and principel prepn t of the Fisons technology. The Fisone data were preeeated to the panel for its consideration. The penal concluded that the 300 mg dose of pentamidine, administered every 4 weeks gifag the Respirgard II jet nebulizer, which was not yet approved by the FDAas of that date, should be used for prophylaxis. As you know, atthe time of that analysis, Fisons had stopped its trials and the results were known to the panel. The panel concluded that:'Because other doses and aerosol delivery systems [,.. , other thanthose developed by Lyphomed] have not been adequately studied andanalyzed, no recommendations regarding such systems can be made.\"MKWR, Vol. 38, No. S-5, pg. 6.696 It is, we believe, particularly noteworthy that in Europe, where Fisons is based, where its nebulizer is freely available, and where there is- no restriction on its use, Europe's standard medical practice is the use of the 300 mg pentamidine dose and the Respirgard II nebulizer. Thus, with their patients' welfare at stake, European physicians have made the independent determination that Fisons' dose and nebulizer have not been shown to be equivalent in efficacy to that developed by Lyphomed. Our experts in fact think, based on their own practice and understanding of the drug and its aerosol administration, that Fisons' regimen and nebulizer is considerably less effective. A major problem lies with Fisons' nebulizer. A particular difficulty with aerosol administration of pentamidine is that pentamidine is an airway irritant. If a medium sized particle nebulizer like the FISONeb is used, because of the larger size of the aerosol particles a substantial amount of drug deposits in the upper airways, resulting in serious airway irritation causing cough or bronchospasm. Therefore, the higher the dose used with a medium sized particle nebulizer (such as Fisons' nebulizer), the greater the chance of serious side effects. The bronchospasm actually interferes with the delivery of drug to the alveoli resulting in ineffective treatment. Thus, a trade press report stated that, in the Fisons' dose-ranging study at the Northwestern University site \"estimates. for 24-week PCP-free survival were 100% in the 60 mg group, 90%-in the 120 mg group, and 79% in the 5 mg group.\" It is likely this association of higher dose with lower efficacy is because the study was too short in duration to obtain accurate estimates of efficacy. Another and also plausible possibility is that Pmimons' ultrasonic nebulizer produces too much bronchospasm at therag her-dose to sufficiently deliver drug to the alveoli and thus vewasnot effective in some patients. w also invite your attention to the fact that, unlike Lyphomed, Fisons has, to our knowledge, never seriously investigated the use .of its nebulizer in treatment (as opposed to prophylaxis) of PCP. That is probably fortunate. Some experts believe that the use of a nebulizer producing larger particles in the treatment context could be life threatening as it might result in ineffective treatment. The best clinical results, both in treatment and in prophylaxis, to date have been reported with a small particle nebulizer such as the Respirgard II used by Lyphomed (manufactured and sold by Marquest). Thus4 based on clinical evidence in humans in both treatment and Mrophylaxis, a small. particle nebulizer (that minimizes brondianpasm while maximizing to the in the and Prevention.\" 676-685 (copy provided). The current state of the art in small particle nebulizers is the Respirgard II- which is why the Respirgard II was used in all Lyphomed trials after careful evaluation. The Respirgard II has proved to be very successful -over the past three years of widespread prophylactic use throughout the United States. Ultimately, in the absence of a head-to-head trial, the question whether Fisons! dose and nebulizer are equivalent to-those shown -to be effective.in Lyphomed's trialsiand in widespread-practice will never be conclusively answered. certainly, in light of the evidence to the contrary, it would be very imprudent to assume equivalence. Cost of Therapv Fisons' claim to lower cost to the patient/user has no basis in fact. -I, As we will demonstrate, -an analysis of the cost of s bch t st~on of pentamidine according to Fisons' regimen shows that Ftmonm' regimen will ultimately cost more than the cost of the currently approved Lyphosed regimen. Typically, the cost of drug has been-a relatively minor component of the total cost of697 administration. If one compares the cost of Lyphomed's oncemonthly therapy with that of Fisons' low-dose, bi-monthlyadministration, the benefit of reduced drug cost is more thanoffset by increases in labor and equipment costs which directlyincreases the cost to the patient. It is important to note that,unlike Lyphomed, Fisons owns and markets the nebulizer (FISONeb)used in their regimen. Thus, their claim is an illusory costreduction that trades off lower drug price with a high nebulizerprice. Fisons strategy is to make money on its nebulizer. The costs comparisons we provide are based on the following factsand assumption: o Lyphomed's regimen uses the Respirgard II nebulizer,which costs $6 and is disposable. o In hospital clinics, the Respirgard II is attached towall air outlets. Thus, the air supply involves noadditional costs. o In physician offices and home care settings theRespirgard II requires a compressor, which can be reusedby many patients. We assume for purposes of this costcomparison a very conservative estimate of five patientsper month per physician office. o Compressor prices range from $200 for a unit that may beattached to one nebulizer at a time to 5450 for a unitto be used by four patients at once. Thus, we assume a$240 compressor cost. o Fisons' regimen used the FISONeb nebulizer, which costs$350. o The FISONeb is reusable, but it would be unsafe, withoutextraordinary precautions, to use it on more than one HIVpositive patient because of the risk of transmission ofpulmonary infections. We assume that FDA would not allowsharing of a FISONeb by multiple HIV positive patients. o For comparative purposes, we amortize both the compressorand the FISONeb over 12 months.o We assume, as does Senator Pryor, that if allowed tomarket pentamidine Fisons would sell the drug at $20 fora 60 mg dose (J.&., the same cost per mg as Lyphomed's300 sg dose). o Finally, as discussed in the preceding section onefficacy, if the Fisons 60 mg dose is not as effectiveas the approved Lyphomed regimen, the cost ofhospitalizing a patient with acute PCP ranges from$12,000 to more than $30,000. In considering the comparisons, the following should be kept inmind: o The administration costs used are very conservative. - We compute a hospital clinic cost for NebuPentadministration of $160.45. Actual clinic costs fromSan Francisco range from $175 to $280 peradministration, which would be double for theFisons regimen of twice monthly administration. -Home care may cost much more than the estimates weuse. o Doubling the number of administrations (required by theFisons' regimen) would: -Increase the burden on HIV positive individuals inscheduling appointments, thus decreasing compliance. -overload public and private clinics facingincreasing demands for PCP prophylaxis. With that introduction, the following calculations demonstrate thatthe Fisons claim to being more economical is simply baseless. Infact, Fisons regimen is more costly particularly in the home caresetting:698 MONTHLY COST OF PENTAMIDINE PROPHYLAXIS HOSPITAL CLINIC Lvphomed Regimen Fisons2Regimen 300 mg. a 4 weeks 60 mag a 2 weeks $99.45 $20.00 $50 x 2 -$100 $5 Lvnhomed' Reaimen 300 ma a 4 weeks $ 6 00 $ 4.00' $50 $ 5 $164.45 MONTHLY COST OF.

Charges for home administration of NebuPent have been reportedas high as $400 per treatment in some areas. Thus, Fisons bi-veekly regimen will be prohibitive for home care in someareas.DRUG:699 The solution to the problem of administration costs cannot,moreover, be solved by administration of pantamidine throughunsupervised use of the Fisons device. Aerosolized pentamidinetreatments have underscored the need for scrupulous infectioncontrol to prevent transmission of other pulmonary infections.Fisons' device lacks disposable components to prevent transmissionof TB and other infections (such as pseudomonas infections) tohousehold members or patients themselves. Use of the Fisons'device without supervision would only increase the risk of suchtransmission. It is, moreover, questionable whether unsupervisedpatients would buy Fisons' device for single use: given theexpense of the unit it is predictable that many would share thesedevices, further increasing the potential for spread of othercommunicable diseases. Since aerosol treatments are also very timeconsuming, unpleasant and disruptive to normal routine, it isunlikely that compliance with treatment would be as good withunsupervised home treatment. Because Fisons' trials were centersupervised, it is not at all clear that their results would begeneralizable to home treatment. Lyphom d's Develooment of Pentamidine Senator Pryor's letter suggests that Lyphomed has abused the OrphanDrug Act by its pricing of pentamidine. That assertion is unfairand may reflect an incomplete understanding of the historical factsconcerning the development of pentamidine. LyphoMed has taken itsresponsibilities to develop pentamidine under the Orphan Drug Actvery seriously. As the FDA is well aware, injectable pentamidine has serioustoxicity. If used inappropriately, patients can be harmed, or thedrug can be ineffective in the treatment of a fatal disease. In1984, when Lyphomed was asked to market this drug, many physicianswere just beginning to learn to manage AIDS cases. If thosephysicians were not properly informed about pentasidine's profileand its correct medical use, the drug's life saving capabilitieswould be lost to those physicians' patients. It thus becam apparent that Lyphomed would have to develop aphysician marketing and educational capability. Lyphomed, at thatpoint, was of course faced with a choice. It could have turnedaway from its responsibility to educate the medical community aboutpeatauidine and kept its price as originally set. Patients sincesaved by pentamidine would have died if Lyphomed had chosen thatcourse. But Lyphomed would not have been criticized for itspricing. Instead, Lyphomed decided that the responsible course ofaction was to develop a physician education capability. Thus, theprice of pentamidine had to be raised to pay for that program. Also in 1984, researchers approached Lyphomed seeking support forpotentially important research with the drug. If the drug couldbe administered by the aerosol route, they theorized, the seriousside effects might be avoided and use for prophylaxis could beconsidered. It soon became apparent that the costs of testingaerosol inhalation in both prophylaxis and acute treatment wouldbe very great. Again, Lyphomed could have turned its back on this research. Likethe manufacturers of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, it could havedeclined to provide more than token support for research concerningits drug. Had it done so, Lyphomed could have kept the price ofthe drug lower and avoided much of the present controversy.Lyphomed could not, however, refuse to support potentially life-saving research. Consequently, the price was raised in incrementsto. pay for what turned out to be, ultimately, a very expensiveresearch progran. The last price rise was in August of 1987. Tamrim=hem ntb n incresd since that time, despite escalatingcosts of current and future research. In an April 1988 hearing that addressed this issue,Congressman Weiss suggested that Lyphomed might haveaccomplished this purpose by licensing the drug out to anothercompany with an existing physician education capability. Butno other company was interested in pentamidine at that time.7urthdr,' even if LyphoMed had licensed the drug to a major cop any, there would be no guarantee that the price would nothave risen, as Congressman Weiss agreed. Certainly no companywould use a detail force without recovering the cost. Thus, a Price increase would be inevitable.700 Then, in October 1987, the day LyphoMed revealed its research results as of that date in a Lyphoaed-sponsored national seminar chaired by Dr. Donald Armstrong at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Fisons announced in London, England to Lyphomed's shock and surprise, that Dr. Armstrong was working with Fisons. This British company was now prepared to reap the rewards of early research supported by Lyphomed. Lyphomed was subsequently informed that Dr. Armstrong had entered into the agreement with Fisons as far back as June 1987, but did not reveal this association until after the Lyphomed research seminar in -October 1987, which he chaired. To our knowledge, Fisons had conducted no research on PCP prophylaxis prior to its agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering in mid-1987. FDA granted Fisons.Orphan Drug Act designation. That meant that, if Fisons had been able to show that its dosage and nebulizer worked before Lyphomed's own NDA for prophylaxis was approved, Lyphomed would have been barred from the market. Lyphomed's investment in aerosol pentamidine research was now very much a business risk. Lyphomed shouldered that risk because of its concern for the people that would be helped by the research and because of the return on investment guaranteed by the Orphan Drug Act if Lyphomed succeeded.. It is, of course, that guarantee that some are apparently now considering abridging. In summary, Lyphomed commenced its support of development of pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis as far back as 1984 with the initial funding of preclinical research 'by Drs. Montgomery and Dabs. Throughout 1985-1988 and continuing into-1989, Lyphomed has provided a stream of funds to other-investigators, in addition to the continued support of Drs. Montgomery and Debs. Lyphomed-could not have done this without the exclusivity provided by the Orphan Drug Act. The funds attributable to that exclusivity have been used to support both PCP prophylaxis and treatment trials with the aerosol formulation, as well as the technological development of new delivery systems, safer and more effective- pentamidine analogues, and improved drug formulations. (As to acute treatment, Lyphomed has just completed the -largest double-blind, randomized well-control-led multi-center trial for acute treatment of PCP performed to date, utilizing the aerosol delivery system. To our knowledge, no other company or organization is investigating treatment of PCP with aerosol pentamidine.) The entire pentamidine research and development program is continuing. As you know, additional research to be funded by Lyphomed includes post-marketing studies required by the FDA such as additional large-scale primary and secondary prophylaxis trials, long-term animal aerosol toxicity studies, animal teratology studies, two-year carcinogenicity studies, and other studies. The expenses to date for all pentamidine studies are estimated at $23 million. The FDA-required post-marketing studies are preliminarily estimated to cost at least an additional $15-$20 million over a period of at least 3 years. Also, the company is supporting a pediatric trial of inhaled pentamidine and supporting 51% of a number of NIH aerosol trials in AIDS patients. Lyphomed is, in addition, supporting research into improved delivery systems for pentamidine and pentamidine analogues that may be essential if PCP should become resistant to pentamidine in its present form. One variant of pentamidine currently being researched may be amenable to an oral dosage form -- allowing pentamidine prophylaxis for children who cannot use the nebulizer and decreasing administration costs significantly. This research is all extremely expensive, and Lyphomed is the only company engaged in such research and development. The total cost to be borne by Lyphomed is enormous and will be ongoing over the next 3-5 years. This expense extends beyond the period of market protection provided by the Orphan Drug Act, which for all practical purposes expires in October 1991 -- J.1_., in less than two years. Although Lyphomed has seven years of exclusivity for aerosol prophylaxis (June 15, 1989 through June 15, 1996), once injectable pentamidine becomes available for generic marketing-in October 1991, the company in effect loses nearly five years of this orphan drug \"exclusivity.\"701 Effect of Orphan Drug Act Amendment on Ormhan Drua Develooment The amendment to the Orphan Drug Act suggested in Senator Pryor's letter is represented to be no more than a 'technical change\" inthe statute that would nevertheless preserve the incentives of thestatute. As we believe you will agree, the signal that would besent by adoption of such an amendment would have far-reachingeffects on decisions by pharmaceutical companies considering investment in orphan drug research. If the statute's grant ofexclusivity can be abrogated simply because a second company's nebulizer ellegedly provides cheaper treatment and the banefits ofexclusivity can be withdrawn, exclusivity will be meaningless,especially when it is needed, J.i., whenever more than one company is 'racing\" for approval. If exclusivity is to be abridged whenever a second company can claim that it 'has developed aclearly superior technology,\" even though it has not perfm aIdhead-to-head tasting to show equivalence, much less superiority, the risk would be ever-present that exclusivity, once earned, would be taken away by subsequent Congressional action. The National Commission oh Orphan Diseases reported sponsors of orphan drugs as concluding that -if they had known what was in store for them, they would probably not have undertaken the sponsorship of their respective orphan drugs,\" NCRD Report, page 99. one thing that is surely in store for any company that produces an important orphan drug is a lobbying effort by a competitor to change the law so as to take away the drug's exclusivity. The arguments made for change are plainly self- serving -- the loser in the race for approval lost its investment and, if allowed onto the market, would offer the drug at a lower price. The National Commission on Orphan Diseases ultimately recommended that the incentives for development of new orphan products be increased, not decreased or made more uncertain. Id. at 100. The Commission based that recommendation in part on a concern that the 'incentives offered by the Orphan Drug Act are not compelling enough to warrant the diversion of corporate resources towards discovery and development of products for the rare diseases.\" Id. at 99. Those incentives would, of course, be seriously undercut if the exclusivity the statute now offers could-be devalued by the type of \"technical change\" which Senator Pryor has asked FDA's advice on. The development of aerosol pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis is truly an Orphan Drug Act success story. It is literally true that lives are being extended and saved by pentamidine prophylaxis today because of the efforts not only of Lyphomed but also, and especially, of those legislators with the wisdom and foresight to pass an Orphan Drug Act that provided meaningful market protection for orphan drugs. We believe, frankly, that Lyphomed deserves credit for this achievement. The record demonstrates that Lyphomed has done an outstanding job in fulfilling its responsibilities, as a holder of Orphan Drug Act exclusivity, to develop pentamidine to its full potential. We hope that you will agree that the circumstances concerning this drug do not warrant an amendment of the statute that would adversely affect both Lyphomed, and by making Orphan Drug Act incentives more uncertain, the future of all oilb\"n drug development. Concluaaion Senator Pryor's letter to the FDA reflects some one-sided and non- factual assertions by representatives of Fisons Corporation. We are encouraged that the Senator has sought further information from the Agency before proceeding with a proposed amendment that would be, we believe, unjustified, not in the public interest and particularly against the best interest of people with AIDS. We trust that you will consider each of these points as you prepare your response to Senator Pryor.

Rockville, MD 20850; telephone 800-458-5231.704 Vol. SS MMWR\" Guidelines for Prophylaxis Against Pneumocystis carinfi Pneumonia for Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCPL the most common presenting manifestation of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a major and recurring cause of morbidity and mortality for persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In recent years, important advances have been made in understanding which patient subpopulations are at.highest risk for developing PCP and in the design of chemotherapeutic regimens that can reduce the frequency of this illness. Recently, a number of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health independently reviewed data on prophylaxis against PCP among persons infected with HIV, and then provided recommendations to the U.S. Public Health Service concerning which persons should receive prophylaxis and what specific prophylactic regimens should be used. The resulting guidelines are detailed below. BACKGROUND Since the early 1980's, management of PCP has become increasingly successful, and several effective chemotherapeutic regimens are available (1). However, such conventional therapy as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or parenteral pentamidine is often complicated by adverse reactions that may require termination of the therapy (2), and the mortality for first episodes of PCP is still 5%*20%. Thus, prevention of PCP is a preferred alternative to treating patients for successive episodes of this disease. Prophylaxis against PCP is categorized as primary if the goal is to prevent an initial episode for a person who has never had PCP. Prophylaxis is categorized as secondary if the goal is to prevent subsequent episodes for a person who has already had at least one episode of PCP. *Henry Masur, M.D..

In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). an ongoing prospective epidemiologic investigation of the transmission and natural history of HIV infection among homosexual men (3). there was a strong association (p<0.001) between the baseline numbers of T-helper lymphocytes (CD4 + cells) and the incidence of PCP (Table 1 .Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier estimate for 323 participants whose counts of C04+ cells were <200/mm3during the study showed that the proportions who had PCP by 6. 12. and 36 months were 13%. 24%. and 390. respectively. Similar results were seen when MACS data were analyzed by fraction of CD4- cells expressed as a percentage of total lymphocytes rather than by absolute number of such cells. In a multivariate analysis of the prospective MACS data, thrush and persistent fever (temperature of >100 F) were additional independent predictors of the development of PCP among patients with CD4 + counts of <200'mm'at their most recent evaluation (Panel of experts, Phair and Muhoz). A retrospective study to investigate the levels of CD4+ at which adult patients develop PCP confirms the MACS data (4). For the 49 episodes of PCP studied, the CD4 + counts were 1-365!mm3(median 26/mm3), and the percentage of circulating lymphocytes that were CD4 + positive was 0.25% (median 4%) within 60 days before the episode (Figure 1). Risk of Recurrent PCP For HIV-infected persons who have had one episode of PCP, there is a high probability that a second episode will occur if no prophylactic measures are taken. Although zidovudine will reduce the frequency of second episodes (5), some persons who receive zidovudine have been reported to have subsequent episodes. In an ongoing study of HIV-infected patients who have had a recently documented episode of PCP (AIDS Clinical Trial Group Study 002), zidovudine therapy was started using two different dosing regimens (6). The study has not yet been unblinded so that TABLE 1.

A preliminary analysis was done on the risk of recurrent PCP for 318 patients followed for up to 6 months and for 122 patients followed up to 12 months on zidovudine (Figure 2) (Panel of experts,- Fischl). These results indicate a need for PCP prophy. laxis in addition to antiretroviral therapy. FIGURE 1.

The only reportedrandomized controlled trial of this drug combination for HIV-infected persons was aprimary-prophylaxis study of 60 adult AIDS patients with Kaposi sarcoma, andcompared !he effect of no treatment with that of a regimen of 160 mg trimethoprimplus 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily plus 5 mg leucovorin calcium oncedaily (9). Compared with untreated patients, those who received prophylaxis hadfewer episodes of PCP and lived longer Adverse reactions were common (50%) andincluded nausea, vomiting, pruritus. and rash, although these reactions also occurredcommonly among patients who were not receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazoleOnly five patients (17%) had to discontinue prophylaxis. There are no results fromcontrolled trials currently available for analysis to indicate whether trimethoprim.sulfamethoxazo;e would be effective or tolerated in other populations of HIV-infectedpatients. Aerosol Pentamidine Clinical studies of aerosol pentamidine for prophylaxis against PCP have beencompleted by two pharmaceutical sponsors. These studies have used differentnebulizing devices and different dosing regimens. In July 1987, a randomized, nonblinded dose-comparison study of aerosol penta-midine was begun in 14 community treatment centers (70). The trial was open to adultpatients who had already had PCP (secondary prophylaxis) as well as patients withKaposi sarcoma and other symptomatic HIV-associated conditions who had neverhad PCP (primary prophylaxis). Patients were randomly assigned to three doseschedules: 30 mg every 2 weeks, 150 mg every 2 weeks, or 300 mg every 4 weeks ofpentamidine delivered by the Respirgard II jet nebulizer (Marquest, Englewood, CO).An interim analysis 1 year after the start of randomization (mean follow-up of 10months) showed that 76 PCP episodes (13 first episodes and 63 recurrent episodes)had occurred: 33/135 (24%) 18/139 the 300-mg group. For patients receiving secondary prophylaxis,the regimen of 300 mg every 4 weeks was associated with substantially fewerepisodes.,of.PCP than the regimen of 30 mg every 2 weeks. There are insufficient datacurrently available from patients receiving primary prophylaxis to demonstratestatistically significant treatment efects among the regimens. The most common adverse effects during treatment were cough and, lessfrequently, wheezing-particularly among smokers and patients with a history ofasthma. These effects could be reduced or prevented by pretreatment with inhaledbronchodilators. No systemic toxicity of the type associated with parenteral penta-midine (e.g., renal insufficiency, hypoglycemia, or neutropenia) was detected, al-though other reports suggest that systemic adverse effects can occur. Patientstolerated the therapy well with supervision, and only two had withdrawn beceuse ofside effects at the time the interim analysis was done.708 Vol. 383 No. S-S MMWR On the basis of these interim results and existing epidemiologic data from natural-history studies, the Food and Drug Administration approved a treatment IND for aerosol pentamidine as both primary-and secondary prophylaxis. recommending the 300-mg dose every 4 weeks and recommending delivery via the Respirgard 11 jetnebulizer. The indication for primary prophylaxis in the treatment IND is a CD4+ count of <200/mm3. Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for anyone who completes therapy for an episode of PCP. Other nebulizers have been used in prophylaxis. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized multicenter trial has recently been conducted in Canada which assessed the safety and efficacy of aerosol pentamidine administered by a Fisons ultrasonic nebulizer (five 60-mg loading doses followed by biweekly doses of 60 mg). These findings have been submitted to the FDA. A study using the Fisons nebulizer and three different doses of aerosol pentamidine has also been completed in the United States and is currently being evaluated. RECOMMENDATIONS On the basis of the data summarized above and the opinions of individual members of the panel of experts, the Public Health Service recommends that-unless contraindications exist-physicians should initiate prophylaxis against PCP for any HIV-infected adult patient who has already had an episode of PCP. even if the patient has been receiving zidovudine. Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis should also be initiated for HIV-infected patients who have never had an episode of PCP if their CD4 -cell count is <200'mm' or if their CD4 + cells are <20% of total lymphocytes. Patients with CD4+ cell counts of <100!mm3 or CD4 + cells <10% and patients with oral thrush or persistent fever (temperature of >100 F) are at particularly high risk for PCP. Patient Evaluation For HIV-infected persons, CD4+ lymphocyte percentages or counts should be monitored at least every 6 months. Some experts prefer to obtain a second count within a few months of the first count to assess the rate of decline. Subsequent CD4 - enumerations may be desirable at intervals of <6 months in certain situations such as: a) the presence of fever or thrush, b) a recent rapid decline in CD4 + cell count. c) a CD4+ percentage in the 20-30 range, or d) a CD4+ absolute number in the 200-300/mm' range. If a decision to start prophylaxis is to be made on the basis of a low CD4+ cell count or percentage, the C041-enumeration should probably be repeated' unless previous determinations indicate the low count or percentage is consistent with an established trend. Some patients may have discordant CD4+ percentages and absolute counts. i.e.. the percentage may be >20% while the CD4 + count may be <200/mm', or vice versa. In such cases, it is probably prudent -after reconfirming the CD4 + enumerations -to assume that the patient is at high risk for PCP if either of these two parameters is in the high-risk range. Clinicians should be aware that in certain unusual circumstances, either the absolute CD4 + count or the CD4 + percentage may not be an accurate reflection of susceptibility to PCP. For example, after splenectomy. HIV-infected patients may be709 u - MMWR June IS, 19m9 susceptible despite normal CD4 + counts. Conversely, some laboratory reagents may not detect CD4+ markers on the T-helper cells of all persons (11), so that such persons may speciously appear to be in the susceptible range. In situations in whichthis phenomenon is suspected (e.g.. when the sum of the number of CD4 + cells and CD8 + cells does not approximately equal the number of CD3 + cells), the lymphocyte sample should be retested with other CD4 + -reagents. Before prophylaxis against PCP is administered, patients must be evaluated to exclude certain active pulmonary diseases. If symptoms, signs, or radiologic abnor- malities suggest that active disease is present, a thorough evaluation for community. acquired pathogens (e g., Pneumococcus). opportunistic pathogens communicable pathogens (e g.. Mycobacterium tuberculosis), tumors, or other processes is indicated. As with other HIV-infected persons, these patients should be given a Mantoux skin test with 5-TU tuberculin. PPD (12). Choice of Prophylactic Agent Scientific studies available to date suggest the following two approaches are effective and safe, although neither has been approved as labelling indications by the Food and Drug Administration. 1) Although it has been studied less extensively among HIV-infected persons than aerosol pentamindine. oral- trimethopniro-sulfamethoxazole (160 mg tri- methoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole).can be given twice daily with 5 mg leucovorin once daily. This form of prophylaxis should not be given to patients with,-a history of type-I hypersensitivity (angioedema or anaphylaxis) or of Stevens-Johnson-syndrome with sulfonamides or tri- methoprim. The efficacy of leucovorin in prevention of toxicity is unknown. 2) Aerosol pentamidine can be given as 300 mg every 4 weeks via the Respirgard 11 jet nebulizer. The dose should be diluted in 6 ml of sterile water and delivered at 6 literstmiriute from a 50-PSI compressed air-source until the reservoir is dry. (Further information -can be obtained by telephoning the Treatment IND number: 1-800-727-7003.) Because other doses and aerosol delivery systems have not- yet been adequately studied and analyzed, no recommendations regarding such systems can be made. For patients who develop cough or wheezing while receiving aerosol pentamidine, pretreatment with a bronchod- ilator can be tried before the aerosol therapy is given-again. Patients with asthma or an extensive history of smoking may not tolerate this form of therapy, and it may not be prudent treatment for a patient with a prior life-threatening reaction to parenteral pentamidine. Since neither aerosol pentamidine nor oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis is known to be safe in association with pregnancy, it is inadvisable to give either agent to HIV infected pregnant women. Rather, such women should be monitored carefully for symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of PCP. Prophylaxis can then be considered for use in the postpar-tum period. Careful monitoring is also indicated for patients intolerant ofaerosol pentamidine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. or for those unwill-ing to receive prophylaxis.710 Vol. 31 No. S-5 MMWR 7 Alternative regimens that are of unproven efficacy and safety for humans, but that might be considered for prophylax;s, include dapsone (daily or weekly), dapsone plus trimethoprim (daily or weekly), or dapsone plus pyrimethamine (daily or weekly) and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (weekly). Follow-Up of Patients Receiving Prophylaxis Since none of the regimens has been shown to be completely protective against PCP for HIV-infected persons, patients who receive prophylaxis should be monitored closely for evidence of PCP, as well as other pulmonary infections. If prophylaxis is discontinued, the patient will again be at increased risk for developing PCP. Prophylaxis failures have been reported in which persons given aerosol pentami- dine, especially at low doses, later had PCP in the upper lobes of the lung (13). In addition. prophylaxis using aerosol pentamidine does not offer protection against extrapulmonary pneumocystosis (14). Prophylaxis for Infants and Children Prieumocystis carini pneumonia is a common manifestation of pediatric AIDS. Most experts agree that some form of prophylaxis is warranted for HIV infected pediatric patients who are at high risk for PCP on the basis of criteria that are analogous to those described above for adults. However, there are insufficient data about the efficacy or toxicity of prophylactic regimens for pediatric patients, so that no scientifically validated guidelines can be provided as yet. There are no data concerning the appropriate dose or delivery system of aerosol pentamidine for infants or children. The appropriate dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophy- laxis might be estimated from trials involving pediatric cancer patients (e. g, tri-methoprim 75 mg!M2plus sulfamethoxazole 375 mgIM2 given orally every 12 hours) (7,8). Further Information Several studies are under way to gain additional information about prophylaxis against PCP. Information about these studies can be obtained from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Information Office (1 800-TRIALS.A) or the American Foundation for AIDS Research (212-333-3118). EDITORIAL COMMENTARY These' guidelines for prophylaxis against PCP indicate a medical benefit from the careful clinical and immunologic monitoring of persons infected with HIV and have several important implications. First, the guidelines are likely to increase the demand for HIV antibody testing by persons who believe they may be at risk for infection. The Public Health Service has estimated that between 945,000 and 1.4 million persons in the United States are infected with HIV (15). Of these persons, CDC estimates that approximately 120,000 have been informed of their infection status as a result ofvoluntary antibody testing carried out in public (primarily Federally funded) HIV counseling and testing centers. The number of persons found through other sourcesof testing to be infected is unknown, but it is likely that many persons who are infecA nt are of thrinfacti Prsons at risk who have not had HIV711 * MMWR June is, 17Fe .antibody testing should now consider such testing because they may be candidates for prophylaxis against PCP if they are found to be infected. Second, the guidelines are likely to increase the demand for medical services by asymptomatic HIlV-infected persons. Such persons will need medical evaluation to determine whether they are candidates for prophylaxis against PCP, and-if prophy. laxis is given-these persons will need medical follow-up. All persons found to be infected at HIV counseling and testing centers should be referred for further medical evaluation, including a measurement of their CD4+ cells. Facilities offering HIV counseling and testing should develop referral networks of medical-care providers sufficient to evaluate and care for the infected persons they identify. These networks should include services related to family planning and treatment for intravenous drug addiction, sexually transmitted disease, and tuberculosis. Third, the guidelines are likely to increase the demand for flow-cytometry ser vices to quantify CD4 + cells from HIlV-infected persons. Laboratories to which samples are referred for flow cytometry should have prior experience, since methodology can greatly influence the quality of test results. Although there are no true reference standards for evaluating blood cells, quality can be assured by adhering to criteria that address sample collection, preparation, instrument calibration and standardiza- tion, flow cytometric analysis, and adequate training of operators (76). Either absolute CD4 -counts or percentage CD4+ cells can be used in monitoring HIV-infected persons. There appears to be less day-to-day fluctuation in percentage of CD4- cells compared with absolute.number, suggesting that the former measure may be more reliable (4.17). This finding is not unexpected since the percentage of CD4- cells is directly measured by flow cytometry, whereas the absolute number is calculated from the absolute and differential white-blood-cell count and the percentage of C04- cells. Fourth, health-care providers who-administer aerosol pentamidine as prophylaxis against PCP should be aware of several occupational safety issues. In particular, they should note the recommendation to exclude active pulmonary disease before starting prophylaxis. A recent investigation of M. tuberculosis infections among the staff members of a health clinic in Florida suggested that one source of infection may have related to the use of aerosol pentamidine treatment for two patients who had positive sputum cultures for M. tuberculosis during the time they received aerosol pentami- dine. One of these two patients coughed profusely both during and after therapy (18). Providers administering aerosol pentamidine should also review the manufacturer's instructions for the use of the nebulizer system, The Respirgard II nebulizer contains a filter designed to remove- most of the pentamidine from exhaled gases. If the nebulizer is improperly used, substantial amounts of pentamidine can be released into the environment, and health-care workers or others in the vicinity may be at risk for the'same adverse events as the patients who received the therapy (19).

Benson Acting Commissioner Food and Drug Administration 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville, MD Dear Mr. Benson: In-our letter of January 17, 1990 regarding the differences between the Lyphomed pentamidine protocol and that of Fisons plc, there was a major omission. As this omission greatly impacts cost of therapy, the basis of Senator Pryor's proposal, we thought it important to bring it to your attention. The calculations on cost of therapy for the Fisons regimen in the hospital, physician clinic, and homecare setting did not take into consideration the fact that a \"loading dose\" is required as indicated by the Fisons' protocol to initiate therapy. This loading dose requires that five (5) doses of 60 mg. nebulized pentamidine be given during the first two weeks of therapy. The bi-weekly doses begin seven (7) days following administration of the last loading dose. In effect, this translates into thirty (30) individual treatments over a one year period (52 weeks), as opposed to thirteen (13) under Lyphomed's approved regimen. The economic impact of this loading dose requirement on the Fisons regimen is as follows (please refer to pages 8 and 9 of the January 17 correspondence): * As reported in the-Fisons presentation to the FDA Antiviral Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting on May 1, 1989. 10401 WeelTouhyAve Rosemont. weeks 60 ma.a 2 weeks $99.45 1 -S 50.00b $300.00' $ 5 $ 5.00 X 5 = $ 25.00 $ 5.00 x 1 -SI LvDhomed1Regimen Fisons2Reaimen 300 mg a 4 weeks 60 ma a 2 weeks $20.00 x 5 = $100.008 $20.00 x hr x 1 = S 50.00b $300.00. $ 5 $ 5.00 x 5 = $ 25.00 $ 5.00 x 1 = S 5.00b $ Recimen 2 weeks $20.00 x 5 = $100.00' $20.00 $269.00 -$326.00 (month 2-12) * first 2 weeks b second and subsequent 2 week periods ' total for first 4 weeks * For references 1-6, please see documentation in correspondence dated January 17, 1990.

SMALDONE, R.J. PERRY, and D.G. DEUTSCH Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Disease Division, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8172 ABSTRACT To characterize aerosolized pentamidine delivery systems, we measured efficiency (drug inspired as percent of dose in nebulizer) and particle size distribution from several nebulizers under simulated clinical conditions. With a piston ventilator, radioactive tracers, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the Cadema AeroTech II, Fisoneb were tested. Each nebulizer was studied with the specific concentration of pentamidine and breathing pattern usually prescribed with the device. We found that each system delivered a significant fraction of respirable particles but there were important differences among nebulizers. With a tidal volume of 750 cc and frequency of 20 breaths/min, the AeroTech II produced a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.0 pim, a = 1.9, efficiency -21%; the Respigard II MMAD = 0.76 pm, a = 1.9, efficiency = 4.6%; and the Fisoneb MMAD = 2.5 pm, as = 2.0, efficiency = 16%. The Fisoneb was also tested at a frequency of 12 breaths/ min with an end-inspiratory breath-hold of 3.5 sec without significant changes in MMAD or a. The size distribution of delivered aerosol was dependent on the type of nebulizer, tubing and attachments, breathing pattern, and presence of medication in the nebulizer. In clinical studies, these factors must be defined before efficacy of a drug can be assessed. Prescribing information should consider the delivery system and its efficiency to prevent inappropriately high or low levels of drug delivery. INTRODUCTION A recent clinical study demonstrating the effectiveness of aerosolized pentamidine as treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (Montgomery et al, 1987) has rekindled interest in aerosol therapy of lung infections. Patient awareness of pentamidine aerosol therapy coupled with the seriousness of PCP has led to widespread anecdotal use of the drug. However, variability between nebulizers has not been assessed. Furthermore, laboratory experiments to measure mass output and particle distribution of aerosol generators often utilize experimental conditions different from the clinical setting under which medical aerosol generators are used. Therefore, the purpose of the present EY_ S AI,_____nuna pentamidine. study was to determine operating characteristics of various nebulizing systems commonly used to treat patients with PCP under conditions similar to those used in clinical practice. It should be recognized that the delivery system itself is not the only variable to consider in aerosol therapy. For example, inpatients with cystic fibrosis, we found that the actual dose of aerosolized medication deposited in the lung was dependent on several factors of equal importance including pulmonary function, breathing pattern and the performance of the nebulizer (Ilowite et al, 1987). Presently, there are no similar dataavailable in patients with PCP and studies are underway. In the meantime, recognition of the differences in presently available nebulizing systems will help in evaluating clinical efficacy. METHODS Principles Polydisperse nebulizing systems are often characterized by measuring the particle size distribution of the 'standing cloud', that is, the aerosol expressed from the nebulizer via the jet used to drive the nebulizer or, in the case of ultrasonic systems, a small internal fan or the suction flow from a cascade impactor. The 'output' can be defined gravimetrically as the loss in weight of the nebulizer or the change in volume of the nebulizer solution over time (Phipps et al, 1987; DahlbAck et al, 1986; Brain and Valberg, 1979). These techniques assume negligible effects on aerosol distribution and output from attachments between the nebulizer and patient, changes in fluid properties from dissolved medications, and changes in the breathing pattern of the patient, Preliminary studies in our laboratory suggested that the above assumptions may not be correct. Many nebulizers depend on baffles and other attachments to regulate size distribution. Surface tension in ultrasonic generators is important. Therefore, it may be necessary to measure the performance of the nebulizer during actual use conditions with tubing in place and medication present in proper dose. Efficiency The experimental configuration for each nebulizer is illustrated in Fig.l (A-C). Each nebulizer and its specific attachments required for clinical use was connected to the Harvard piston ventilator at the site of the patient mouthpiece. Interposed between the nebulizer tubing and the ventilator was an absolute filter of low resistance defined as the linspiratory filter'. Duringinspiration, this filter is presented with the aerosol that would ordinarily beinhaled by the patient. With a radioactive tracer (Technetium pertechnetate (99MTc)) originally mixed in the nebulizer with a solution of pentamidine orsaline, the nebulizer efficiency can be defined as the fraction of the initial activity in the nebulizer deposited on. the inspiratory filter. If the radioactivity in the aerosol accurately reflects aerosolized pentamidine, thisefficiency represents the fraction of pentamidine originally placed in thenebulizer that would be inhaled by a patient breathing at the same frequency and tidal volume, set on the ventilator.\" Efficiency of the Respigard II was also measured using 99mTc-human serumalbumin Lake Success, N.Y.,O.lcc) as the radioactive labels.These were tested because the 99mTc pertechnetate which was used for thelaboratory testing of nebulizers is freely permeable to the lung and notsuitable for deposition studies. The other compounds do not readily enter theblood when deposited in the lung and are frequently used in clinical studies. However, they have different physical properties than pertechnetate and they may not reflect the delivery of aerosolized drug if they behave differently inthe nebulizer. a 1i4718 Particle distribution To assess the distribution of particle sizes in the aerosol, a ten stage cascade impactor (Delron Research, Powell, Ohio) was connected in line just upstream to the inspiratory-filter. In a series of experiments separate from the efficiency measurements, the radiolabelled aerosol was sampled at 1.0 1/min * with the ventilator on or off (standing cloud). During ventilated nebulization, the inspiratory filter caught all the particles in the inspiratory stream that are not sampled by the cascade and there were no particles in the exhaled air from the ventilator.

This ultrasonic nebulizer has a small internal fan that moves the aerosol from an inner chamber to the tubing containing the patient's ventilatory stream. For all experiments the rheostat governing this flow was set on min-, its lowest setting. The nebulizer is actuated manually only during inspiration. Patients are instructed to exhale through their nose or to disconnect from the mouthpiece after each inhalation. To duplicate thispattern we installed the Rudolph valve which separates the inspiratory and expiratory streams from the ventilator and prevents exhalation into the nebulizer. No expiratory filter is supplied. sample represents only the inhaled aerosol distribution. With the ventilator disconnected, the aerosol passes out of the nebulizer carried by the jet (AeroTech II and Respigard II) or the internal fan (Fisoneb) for measurement ofthe standing cloud. For each nebulizer, serial cascades were performed atintervals during nebulization to evaluate aerosol distribution throughout theperiod of aerosol delivery. - Experimental protocol Breathing pattern: To compare different nebulizers, and measure the effects of other variables, it is necessary to standardize the breathing pattern. In clinical studies, during aerosol inhalation, patients are usuallyinstructed to breathe in a relaxed 'tidal' manner. Therefore, we used a tidal volume of 750 cc and a frequency at 20 breaths per min. These values were chosen based on the optimum pattern observed in our previous study in patients with cystic fibrosis (Ilowite et al, 1987). Patients with PCP may breathe differently but data on their behavior is presently unavailable. All three nebulizers were tested using this pattern. Because the Flsoneb has been reported to be used at a frequency of approximately 12 breaths per minute followed by a 3.5 sec breath-hold (NIH protocol ACTG 069), that nebulizer wastested with both patterns. The following conditions were fixed for each system (sources are listed): AeroTech II: 4cc distilled water, 10 I/min flow, 50 PSI, 300mg pentamidine (LyphoMed, Rosemont, Ill.), running time (to dryness) 15 min. (Cadema Medical Products Inc.). Respigard II: 6cc distilled water, 6 1/min flow, 50 PSI, 300mg or 600mg pentamidine (LyphoMed), running time of 20 min (NIH protocol ACTG 040), this leaves 2-3 cc of the original solution in the nebulizer). 116720 3cc (1 ampule) solution of 60 Bedford, MA.), flow setting on 'min' nebulizer actuated manually only on inspiration, running time (to dryness) 6 min. (Fisons Corporation and NIH protocol ACTG 069). In addition to the conditions described above the following experiments were performed to further investigate the peculiarities of each system. \"Standing cloud' aerosol distribution; i.e. the distribution without the Harvard pump ventilating the system. Each nebulizer was run completely assembled as in Fig. 1 but the aerosol sampled was delivered to the cascade by the gas running the nebulizer (or the internal fan in the case of the Fisoneb). All nebulizers were filled with 0.9% saline for these experiments. Respigard TT without tubing and valve attachments; of ail the tested systems, the Respigard IT has the most complicated inline attachments (Y piece and one-way valve between nebulizer and patient). The nebulizer was studied alone, with the one-way valve, and with all attachments to determine possible effects on aerosol distribution. Aerosol distrihution and efficiency with and without nentamidine added to the solutionn These experiments illustrate the tendency of a given nebulizer to be affected by the active drug. HPLC analysis When aqueous solutions are nebulized, the solutes nften are concentrated due to evaporation and, in addition, some may be adsorbed:=nto surfaces of the nebulizer walls. To insure that the radiolabel behaved in-a manner similar to the drug, we analyzed the nebulizer solution serially for pentamidine and radioactivity during typical experimental runs. Each specimen was analyzed by scintillation counting for radioactivity and pentamidine by HPLC. HPLC was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Model MPF-44B using methods described by Lin et al, 1986. 10 Il samples were taken of the nebulizer fluid at periodic intervals and related on a percentage basis to time = 0 (100 %). The results were averaged and converted to percentages of the initial values at time = 0. The mean percents of the radioactivity measurements were compared to the mean percents of the HPLC pentamidine determinations by paired t test. Significance was-assigned a p value of S 0.05. - RESWLTS Nebulizer efficiency The relationship between inspired aerosol and running time for each nebulizer is shown in Fig. 2. Activity on the inspiratory filter was serially sampled at fixed intervals over the prescribed running time. Each nebulizer produced particles at aconstent rate over most .of the running time. The Fisoneb-and AeroTech IT are actually nebulized to dryness and their production tends to plateau towards the end of the run. The Respigard II has a relatively low production rate and because of patient fatigue its use is limited to 20 min (NIH protocol ACTG 040). Therefore the Respigard II aerosol generated is linear over the entire running period and when shut off the nebulizer chamber still aontains approximately 2-3 cc of fluid. The total aerosol captured on -the inspiratory filter as a percent of the initial activity placed in the nebulizer defines each unit's efficiency. Efficiency data for all experiments are shown in Table 1. Each run represents data from a separate nebulizer except for the Fisaneb data, which were obtained from a single ultrasonicpebultzer. 4., 117 ';721 I .5 10 15 20 Ttmn (mit) 10 15 Time (min)AeroTech II .Respigard II 20 25 Fisoneb 0 2 4 6 a Time (min) FIGURE 2: Inspired Aerosol vs Running Time.

Under the conditions described above, with pentamidine in solution, the AeroTech II and Fisoneb deliver approximately 21 and 16 %, respectively, of theoriginal activity to the inspiratory filter. The Respigard II, however, is much less efficient delivering on the average 4.6 % for solutions containing pentamidine. Efficiency does not appear to be affected by the presence of the drug. When the Fisoneb is operated at a lower respiratory frequency, the efficiency is still in the same range as the \"standard\" breathing pattern. Also listed on Table 1 are the efficiencies measured when the 99mTc-HSA and 99mTc-SC were substituted for 99-Tc-pertechnetate. Efficiency measured by 99mTc-HSA (3.6%) was similiar to the routine pertechnetate value. For the sulphur colloid experiments, however, efficiency as assessed by radioactivity was greatly diminished and averaged 0.56 % (see DISCUSSION). 11919 '22 22 21AERLYICH II 1 2 3 4 RESPIGARD II 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 FISOIEB 1 2 3 4 5 6723 Particle distribution Particle distributions for each nebulizer under simulated clinical conditions are shown in Fig. 3.

Without pentamidine, the aerosols were somewhat smaller (between 0.60 & 0.90 pm; runs 4-7) than those obtained with pentamidine in solution (1.0-1.1 pm, runs 1 & 2) indicating the addition of the drug increased the size of the aerosol. The standing cloud (runs 3a & 3b) is larger than the saline aerosol produced during ventilation with the Harvard pump (runs 4-7). Serial cascade determinations performed on the same nebulizer over different periods during the prescribed total nebulization run demonstratedthat the aerosol distribution did not significantly change during the standarddelivery time period. RESPIGARD II The presence of pentamidine had a greater effect on the Respigard II. Runs 1-5 indicate pentamidine aerosols in the range of 0.72-0.78 pm. Salineaerosols were significantly smaller at 0.25 pm (runs 6-8). In addition, the distribution of the saline aerosols cannot be approximated by a single value of a because their distributions were more bimodal (Fig. 5). Like the AeroTech II, the Respigard II is supplied with one-way valves to separate theinspiratory and expiratory streams of airflow but, for the Respigard II, theexpiratory valve is inline between the nebulizer and the patient. These appear to effect the final aerosol distribution. As pictured in Fig. 1B, theRespigard II attachments between the nebulizer and the patient include a T piece, a one-way valve and the final Y connection. In run lOa, the standing cloud from the nebulizer and the T piece was measured at 1.2 pm. With the one way valve added, the MMAD decreased to 0.68 pm (lOb). The Y piece had little added effect (MMAD = 0.62, lOc). With the Harvard pump ventilating the assembled system the particle size was reduced from 0.52 pm (standing cloud) to 0.25 pm (runs 9a-b). The aerosol distribution did not change during the period of nebulization as mesured by serial cascades (runs 5a-b & 8a-b). Finally, theaddition of HSA to the solution (2.1 mg) did not affect the distribution (runs 2 & 3). E 10, 3.2 M 0 so 1 00 Ciumulatlve \u00b0 FIGURE 5: Respigard II distributions: with circles). FISQNIESBf .:With pentamidine in solution, the breathing pattern did not appear to affect the final aerosol distribution (run I compared to runs 5-7). However, saline aerosols were more sensitive to ventilation, with a bimodal aerosol of 0.80-0.88 pm produced at a frequency of 12, breath hold 3.5 sec (runs 8 & 9) 122726 which contrasted with the same solution ventilated at 20/min (MMAD 2.1-2.3, runs 2 & 3). The standing cloud was much larger with the MMAD equal to 5.3 pm (run 4). Timed cascades did not show any changes in aerosol distribution during the treatment period (runs 2 & 3). The effect of pentamidine on the ,final aerosol distribution for the slower breathing frequency is shown in detail in Fig. 6. Under these conditions, the Fisoneb is more sensitive to breathing pattern and the presence of pentamidine. However, under clinical delivery conditions, all the Fisoneb aerosols with pentamidine present are similar. 10 E 5-.1E E E 0 50 100 Cumulative % FIGURE 6: Fisoneb distributions, frequency = 12; with pentamidine (60 mg, open rectangles), without pentamidine (saline, filled rectangles). The saline aerosol appears bimodal. HPLC measurements Fig. 7 demonstrates the changes in concentration of 99mTc-pertechnetate and pentamidine during nebulization. For each nebulizer, three separate runs were performed with duplicate samples for each time indicated in Fig. 7 (6 pairs for statistical analysis). The level of precision for the radioactive and pentamidine assays is indicated by the narrow standard deviation bars at time = 0. The AeroTech II and Respigard II, both jet nebulizers, concentrated both radioactivity and pentamidine. For the AeroTech II, no significant differences were found between pentamidine and the pertechnetate label. However, at 10 min, near the end of the run, the experimental variation increased, probably due to unstable operation as the solution ran out. The Respigard II, however, is not run to dryness and operation appears more stable. Under these conditions, small but statistically significant differences between the radiolabel and pentamidine were seen with pentamidine more concentrated than pertechnetate. Correction of the efficiencies listed in Table 1 for these differences would not be more than 5-10% of the listed values. The Fisoneb does not concentrate its solution with time and no differences were measured between pentamidine and pertechnetate. 123727 AeroTech 11 I- U 0 2 10' Ttle Cmun) Respigard II - pp.045 15 Tim* (min)I. 20 Fisoneb ; ......--*0 i 2 3 4 Time (mbin) FIGURE 7: Simultaneous measurement of radioactivity (99mTc) and pentamidineconcentration as percents of initial values. 124150- a 0 Avg 99mTc---728 DISCUSSION The present paper demonstrates that the type of nebulzer, its attachments, and the mode of aerosol delivery can result in important differences in the quantity of inhaled drug and the size distribution of inhaled particles. Standard laboratory techniques to measure aerosol distribution and nebulizer output may not be adaquate to predict drug delivery in clinical use. For example, the Fisoneb produced a MMAD of 5.3 pm when aerosolized saline was presented to the cascade impactor by its internal fan. When the same system was ventilated using patterns mimicking actual clinical conditions the observed MMAD decreased to 2.5 pm. The dependency of particle size on nebulizer attachments, illustrated with the Respiqard II data, precludes the substitution of different tubing and valves in clinical use. Otherwise, the aerosol distribution cannot be guaranteed. Of equal importance was the effect of added medication. In every case, the addition of pentamidine increased particle sizes and often changed the overall distribution. This effect was most pronounced for the Fisoneb and may be related to the dependence of ultrasonically produced aerosols on surface tension (Brain and Valberg, 1979). Efficiency can vary by several fold among nebulizers. This fact may be clinically important. For example, using Montgomery's treatment regimen, 600 mg of pentamidine nebulized for 20 min via the Respigard II would deliver approximately 27.6 mg of pentamidine to the patient (600 x 0.046). To deliver an equivalent amount of pentamidine using the AeroTech II, the dose in the nebulizer should be reduced to 135 mg, reflecting the differences in nebulizer efficiency. The differences between the 99mTc pertechnetate, HSA and SC radiolabels shown in Table 1 demonstrate the importance of confirming the parallel behavior of a label and the active drug. All the data used to assess nebulizers in the present paper were determined with 99MTc-pertechnetate. If we had used s9mTc-SC, a compound commonly used in human aerosol studies, Respigard II efficiencies would have been grossly underestimated. Well-counter determinations of residual radioactivity in the nebulizer indicated that a. large proportion of the colloid remained in the nebulizer and may have been adsorbed onto plastic surfaces. 99mTc-HSA, however, appeared to behave similarly to the pertechnetate and is probably suitable for patient studies with the Respigard II. These experiments were preliminary and were performed to illustrate that even isotopic labels need to be characterized for each system. Before using the albumin label, the activity-pentamidine concentration curves must be determined as they were done for pertechnetate in Fig 7. The points mentioned above provide a framework for clinical evaluation of aerosolized medication, but, laboratory testing is only a first approximation towards a thorough-understanding of the behavior of an aerosol delivery system. For aerosolized antibiotics,-a satisfactory clinical result may be dependent on the amount of local deposition and--ites of infection and these needs will vary with different diseases. Clearly, the amount of drug actually delivered is important, and yet it is rarely considered in clinical protocols. Further, patient factors that influence lung deposition are of equal significance. Even with-adaquate delivery, the aerosol may fail to deposit because of patient related factors. Presently, only a single quantitative study measuring these factors in a clinical population is .available. In patients with cystic fibrosis, Ilowite et al (1987-).:measured total and regional deposition of aerosolized gentamic-in, withiia7.fixed MMAD and a, and found that sites of deposition were strongly dependent on the underlying mechanical state of the patient's lung. Further, the total deposition in a given patient was a complex function of the breathing pattern. An optimum breathing pattern was found that was a function of changing nebulizer output combined with changing breath by breath lung deposition. These observations could not be predicted from laboratory tests of the-nebulizer alone or from physiological studies of aerosol deposition. We should emphasize that Ilowite's study, as well as the present paper, do not set standards for clinical aerosol use. They provide a better understanding of drug delivery and lung deposition. The clinical 125729 importance of the factors discussed above remains to be demonstrated. Quantitative pilot studies in patients should be performed for a given clinical situation to determine the range of lung dose, sites of deposition, acute toxicities and other factors that could be important in interpreting the results of large scale clinical trials.

HOPEWELL Because of high frequency of advers re ac- tions to current standard therapy for Pneu- mocysris cariaii pneumonia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), development of new approaches to treatment is of considerable importance (14). Recentdy, it has been shown that in normal mice, high pulmonary cooceotrations of pen- tamidine are present 48 h after aerosol ministration aerosolized pen- tamidine he tine as treatment or prophylaxis in the rat pneumocystosis model and effective therapy for P cttinii pneumonia in patients with AIDS (6-8). We describe here a device to generate and deliver pentamidine aerosol to humans. Using this device, we have shown that high alveolar concettrations of the drug are produced with little systemic uptake in pa- tients with suspected P carioii pneumonia. Administration of pentamidine in the form of an aerosol directly into the lungs has the potential of being both effective and well tolerated becase of the intra-alveolar Inc- tion of the organism and becase systemic absorption is minimal. The system (Itspigard 11; Marqisat, aomprod So prodmtceohe aerosol, and ont-wy solves in patients whie min- atr Mhlt. act as haffitle to decrease portide simre and direct espired air to figre 1).

Little or no systemic absorption w detectable. In contrast, meat peak serum pentamidine conceteions uswing an identical assay in patients with AIDS and P carinii receiving a single 4-mg/kg done of intravenous pentanidine are 612 og/ml (12). Although adverse reactions to pentamidioe have not behn correlated with its concentra- don in blood, very low concentrations of the drug in blood may greatly reduce ius effects on organs other than the lungs. In an open trial of merosolized pentaraidine for P crinii pneumonia in patientn with AIDS. systemic adverse reactionitdid not Occur. The only ad- verse reaction was cough. presumably from airway irritation (8). It is not known whether pentanddine, the sulfite in isethionate. pH. or other factors are responsible for this air- way irritation. Howver, other sulfite-con- taining compounds cause significant airway constriction in asthmatics at doses 100-fold lens than the concentration of sulfite used in these tudies (13). Alarer particle-sired amn- sml would lead to increased airway deposition and might increase nirway toricity (14). Exactly where in the lung the pentamidine was deposited could not be determined by ourstudy. Performing HAL 18 to 24 h after ad- ministration of the srosol should have al- lowed enoughr time for the drug to have been cleared by the mucociliary system, thereby suggesting predominantly alveolar deposition as would be predicted from the siae of the particles generated (14). It is possible. how- ever, that in the presence of lung inflarun- don and edema, mucociliary clearance was slowed and that some of the material obtainsed by Invge wus derived from the airways. The finding thau concentrations of pentanidine ae much greater in HAL sediment than in superoatant is consistent with the drug being taken up by celis within the air spaces In pa- dents with P conroii pncumonia, HAL redi- ment is predominantly alveolar macrophages, although other cela may have contained pen- tamidine (1). The variability of HAL pentanddine ovels after aerosolization is not surptising. We did not control for breathing patterns or severity of disease, and both may affect acrtool depo- sition (14). In addition. interpatient differ- occur marked variability penutamidine serum lev- eLs has been reported after intravenous ad- ministration (12). In conclusion, wing this aerosol device.

In recent years, important advances have been made in understanding which patient subpopulations are at highest risk for developing PCP and in the design of chemotherapeutic regimens that can reduce the frequency of this illness. Recently, a number of experts' convened by the National Institutes of Health independently reviewed data onprophylaxis against PCP among persons infected with HIV, and then provided recommendations to the U.S. Public Health Service.concerning which personsshould receive prophylaxis and what specific prophylactic regimens should beused The resulting guidelines are detailed below. BACKGROUND Since the early 1980's, management of PCP has become increasingly successful, and several effective chemotherapeutic regimens are available (1). However, such conventional therapy as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or parenteral pentamidine is often complicated by adverse reactions that may require termination of the therapy (21, and the mortality for first episodes of PCP is still 5%-20%. Thus, prevention of PCP is a preferred alternative to treating patients for successive episodes of this disease. Prophylaxis against PCP is categorized as primary if the goal is to prevent an initial episode for a person who has never had PCP. Prophylaxis is categorized as secondary if the goal is to prevent subsequent episodes for a person who has already had at least one episode of PCP.

In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study(MACS), an ongoing prospective epidemiologic investigation of the transmission andnatural history of HIV infection among homosexual men (3), there was a strongassociation (p<0.001) between the baseline numbers of T-helper lymphocytes (CD4 +cells) and the incidence of PCP (Table 1). Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier estimate for 323participants whore counts of CD4+ cells were <200/mm3during the study showedthat the proportions who had PCP by 6, 12, and 36 months were 13%, 24%, and 39%,respectively. Similar results were seen wvhen MACS data were analyzed by fraction of CD4+cells expressed as a percentage of total lymphocytes rather than.byabsolute numberof such cells. In a multivariate analysis of the prospective MACS data, thrush andpersistent fever (temperature of >100'F) were additional independent predictors ofthe development of PCPamong patients with CD4 + counts of <200/mm3at their mostrecent evaluation (Panel of experts,* Phair and Mufioz). A retrospective study to investigate the levels of CD4 + at which adult patientsdevelop PCP confirms the MACS data (4). For the 49 episodes of PCP studied, theCD4+ counts were 1-365/mm3(median 26/mm3), and the percentage of circulatinglymphocytes that were CD4 + positive was 0-25% (median 4%) within 60 days beforethe episode (Figure 1). Risk of Recurrent PCP For HIV-infected persons who have had one episode of PCP, there is a highprobability that a second episode;will occur if no prophylactic measures are taken.Although zidovudine will reduce the frequency of second episodes (5), some personswho receive zidovudine have been reported to have subsequent episodes. In anongoing studywvf-HIV-infected patients who have hadcamentlJy different dosing regimens (6). The study has not yet been unblinded so that TABLE 1.

A preliminary analysis was done on the risk of recurrent PCP for 318 patients followed for up to 6 months and for 122 patients followed up to 12 months on zidovudine (Figure 2) (Panel of experts, Fischl). These results indicate a need for PCP prophy. laxis in addition to antiretroviral therapy. FIGURE 1.

The only reporrandomized controlled trial of this drug combination for HIV-infected persons waprimary-prophylaxis study of 60 adult AIDS patients with Kaposi sarcoma, acompared the effect of no treatment with that of a regimen of 160 mg trimethopiplus 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily plus 5 mg leucovorin calcium ordaily (9). Compared with untreated patients, those who received prophylaxis tfewer episodes of PCP and lived longer. Adverse reactions were common (50%) aincluded nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash, although these reactions also occurrcommonly among patients who were not receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazcOnly five patients (17%) had to discontinue prophylaxis. There are no results frccontrolled trials currently available for analybis to indicate whether trimethoprisulfamethoxazole would be effective or tolerated in other populations of HIV-infectpatients. Aerosol Pentamidine Clinical studies of aerosol pentamidine for prophylaxis against PCP have becompleted by two pharmaceutical sponsors. These studies have used differenebulizing devices and different dosing regimens. In July 1987, a randomized, nonblinded dose-comparison study of aerosol pen:midine was begun in 14 community treatment centers (10). The trial was open to ad'patients who had already had PCP (secondary prophylaxis) as well as patients witnKaposi sarcoma and other symptomatic HIV-associated conditions who had neverhad PCP (primary prophylaxis). Patients were randomly assigned to three doseschedules: 30 mg every 2 weeks, 150 mg every 2 weeks, or 300 mg every 4 weeks ofpentamidine delivered by the Respirgard II jet nebulizer (Marquest, Englewood, CC'An interim analysis 1 year after the start of randomization (mean follow-up ofmonths) showed that 76 PCP episodes (13 first episodes and 63 recurrent episodehad occurred: 33/135 (24%) 18/139 the 300-mg group. For patients receiving secondary prophylax;the' regimen of 300 mg every 4 weeks was associated with substantially fewepisodes of PCP than the regimen of 30 mg every 2 weeks. There are insufficient dacurrently available from patients receiving primary prophylaxis to demonstrastatistically significant treatment effects among the regimens. The most common adverse effects during treatment were cough and, le:frequently, wheezing-particularly among smokers and patients with a.history -asthma' These effects could be reduced or prevented by pretreatment with inhalebronchodilators. No systemic toxicity of the type associated with parenteral pentmidine (e.g., renal insufficiency, hypoglycemia, or neutropenia) was detected, ethough other reports suggest that systemic adverse effects can occur. Patientolerated the therapy well-with supervision, and only two had withdrawn becauseside effects at the time the interim snalv.;e w-e 4-746 Vol. 3/1 No. S- MMWR I On the basis of these interim results and existing epidemiologic data from natural-history studies, the Food and Drug Administration approved a treatment IND for aerosol pentamidine as both primary and secondary prophylaxis, recommending the 300-mg dose every 4 weeks and recommending delivery via the Respirgard II jet nebulizer. The indication for primary prophylaxis in the treatment IND is a CD4+ count of <200/mm3. Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for anyone who completes therapy for an episode of PCP. Other nebulizers have been used in prophylaxis. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized multicenter trial has recently been conducted in Canada which assessed the safety and efficacy of aerosol pentamidine administered by a Fisons ultrasonic nebulizer (five 60-mg loading doses followed by biweekly doses of 60 mg). These findings have been submitted to the FDA. A study using the Fisons nebulizer and three different doses of aerosol pentamidine has also been completed in the United States and is currently being evaluated. RECOMMENDATIONS On the basis of the data summarized above and the opinions of individual members of the panel of experts, the Public Health Service recommendsthat-unless contraindications exist-physicians should initiate prophylaxis against PCP for any HIV-infected adult patient who has already had an episode of PCP, even if the patient has been receiving zidovudine. Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis should also beinitiated for HIV-infected patients who have never had an episode of PCP if their CD4 + cell count is <200/mm3 or if their CD4 + cells are <20% of total lymphocytes. Patients with CD4+ cell counts of <100/mm3 or CD4+ cells <10% and patients with oral thrush or persistent fever (temperature of >100'F) are at particularly high risk for PCP. Patient Evaluation For HIV-infected persons, CD4+ lymphocyte percentages or counts should be monitored at least every 6 months. Some experts prefer to obtain a second count within a few months of the first count to assess the rate of decline. Subsequent C04 + enumerations may be desirable at intervals of <6 months in certain situations such as: a) the presence of fever or thrush, b) a recent rapid decline in CD4+ cell count. c) a CD4+ percentage in the 20-30 range, or d) a CD4+ absolute number in the 200-300/mm3 range. If a decision to start prophylaxis is to be made on the basis of a low CD4+ cell count or percentage, the CD4+ enumeration should probably be repeated, unless previous determinations indicate the low count or percentage is consistent with an established trend. Some patients may have discordant CD4+ percentages and absolute counts, i.e.,the percentage may be >20% while the CD4 + count may be <200/mm3, or vice versa. In such cases, it is probably prudent-after reconfirming the CD4+ enumerations-to assume thatzhe patient is at high risk for PCP if either of these two parameters is in the high-risk range. Clinicians should be aware that in certain unusual circumstances, either the absolute CD4+ count or the CD4+ percentage may not be an accurate reflection of --- --'e tomv. HIV-infected patients may be747 6 MMWR June 16, 1985 susceptible despite normal CD4+ counts. Conversely. some laboratory reagents maynot detect CD4+ markers on the T-helper cells of all persons (11), so that suchpersons may speciously appear to be in the susceptible range. In situations in whichthis phenomenon is suspected (e.g., when the sum of the number of CD4 + cells andCD8 + cells does not approximately equal the number of CD3 + cells), the lymphocytesample should be retested with other CD4+ reagents. Before prophylaxis against PCP is administered, patients must be evaluated toexclude certain active pulmonary diseases. If symptoms, signs, or radiologic abnor-malities suggest that active disease is present, a thorough evaluation for community-acquired pathogens (e.g., (e.g., Mycobacreriumtuberculosis), tumors, or other processes is indicated. As with other HIV-infectedpersons, these patients should be given a Mantoux skin test with 5-TU tuberculin,PPD (12). Choice of Prophylactic Agent Scientific studies available to date suggest the following two approaches areeffective and safe, although neither has been approved as labelling indications by theFood and Drug Administration. 1) Although it has been studied less extensively among HIV-infected persons thanaerosol pentamindine, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 mg tri-methoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole) can be given twice daily with 5 mgleucovorin once daily. This form of prophylaxis should not be given to patientswith a history of type-I hypersensitivity (angioedema or anaphylaxis) of Stevens-Johnson with sulfonamides or tri-methoprim. The efficacy of leucovorin in prevention of toxicity is unknown. 2) Aerosol pentamidine can be given as 300 mg every 4 weeks via the Respirgard11 jet nebulizer. The dose should be diluted in 6 ml of sterile water and deliveredat 6 liters/miriute from a 50-PSI compressed air source until the reservoir is dry.(Further information can be obtained by telephoning the Treatment INDnumber: 1-800-727-7003.) Because other doses and aerosol delivery systemshave not yet been adequately studied and analyzed, no recommendationsregarding such systems can be made. For patients who develop cough orwheezing while receiving aerosol pentamidine, pretreatment with a bronchod-ilator can be tried before the aerosol therapy is given again. Patients withasthma or an extensive history of smoking may not tolerate this form oftherapy, and it may not be prudent treatment for a patient with a priorlife-threatening reaction to parenteral pentamidine. Since neither aerosol pentamidine nor oral trimethoprim-sulfarrethoxazole prophylaxis is known to be safe in association with pregnancy, it is inadvisableto give either agent to HIV-infected pregnant women. Rather, such womenshould be monitored carefully for symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalitiessuggestive of PCP. Prophylaxis can then be considered for use in the postpar-tum period. Careful monitoring is also indicated for patients intolerant ofaerosol pentamidine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or for those unwill-ing to receive prophylaxis.748 Vol. 38 I No. S-5 MMWR 7 Alternative regimens that are of unproven efficacy and safety for humans, butthat might be considered for prophylaxis, include dapsone (daily or weekly),dapsone plus trimethoprim (daily or weekly), or dapsone plus pyrimethamine(daily or weekly) and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (weekly). Follow-Up of Patients Receiving Prophylaxis Since none of the regimens has been shown to be completely protective against PCP for HIV-infected persons, patients who receive prophylaxis should be monitoredclosely for evidence of PCP, as well as other pulmonary infections. If prophylaxis isdiscontinued, the patient will again be at increased risk for developing PCP.Prophylaxis failures have been reported in which persons given aerosol pentami-dine, especially at low doses, later had PCP in the upper lobes of the lung (13). Inaddition, prophylaxis using aerosol pentamidine does not offer protection (14). Prophylaxis for Infants and Children Pneumocystis carindi pneumonia is a common manifestation of pediatric AIDS.Most experts agree that some form of prophylaxis is warranted for HIV-infectedpediatric patients who are at high risk for PCP on the basis of criteria that areanalagous to those described above for adults. However, there are insufficient dataabout the efficacy or toxicity of prophylactic regimens for pediatric patients, so thatno scientifically validated guidelines can be provided as yet. There are no dataconcerning the appropriate dose or delivery system of aerosol pentamidine forinfants or children. The appropriate dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophy-laxis might be estimated from trials involving pediatric cancer patients (e.g., tri-methoprim 75 mg/M2plus sulfamethoxazole 375 mg/M2given orally every 12hours) (7,8). Further Information Several studies are under way to.gain additional information about prophylaxisagainst PCP. Information about these studies can be obtained from the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Information Office (1 -800-TRIALS-A) or theAmerican Foundation for AIDS Research (212-333-3118). EDITORIAL COMMENTARY These guidelines for.prophylaxis against PCP indicate a medical benefit from thecareful clinical and immunologic monitoring of persons infected with HIV and haveseveral important implications. First, the guidelines are likely to-increase the demandfor HIV antibody testing by persons who believe they may be at risk for infection. ThePublic Health Service has estimated that between 945,000 and 1.4 million persons inthe United States are infected with HIV (15). Of these persons, CDC estimates thatappToxirnately 120,000 have been informed of their infection status as a result ofvoluntary antibody testing carried out in public (primarily Federally funded) HIVcounseling and testing centers. The number of persons found through other sourcesof testing to be infected is unknown, but it is likely -that many persons who areinfected are not aware of their infection. Persons at risk who have not had HIV749 e 8 . MMWR June le, 1989 antibody testing should now consider such testing because they may be candidates for prophylaxis against PCP if they are found to be infected. Second, the guidelines are likely to increase the demand for medical services by asymptomatic HIV-infected persons. Such persons will need medical evaluation to determine whether they are candidates for prophylaxis against PCP, and-if prophy- laxis is given-these persons will need medical follow-up. All persons found to be infected at HIV counseling and testing centers should be referred for further medical evaluation, including a measurement of their C04+ cells. Facilities offering HIV counseling and testing should develop referral networks of medical-care providers sufficient to evaluate and care for the infected persons they identify. These networks should include services related to family planning and treatment for intravenous drug addiction, sexually transmitted disease, and tuberculosis. Third, the guidelines are likely to increase the demand for flow-cytometry services to quantify CD4+ cells from HIlV-infected persons. Laboratories to which samples are referred for flow cytometry should have prior experience, since methodology can greatly influence the quality of test results. Although there are no true reference standards for evaluating blood cells, quality can be assured by adhering to criteria that address sample collection, preparation, instrument calibration and standardiza- tion, flow cytometric analysis, and adequate training of operators (76). Either absolute CD4+ counts or percentage CD4+ cells can be used in monitoring HIV-infected persons. There appears to be less day-to-day fluctuation in percentage of CD4+ cells compared with absolute number, suggesting that the former measure may be more reliable (4,17). This finding is not unexpected since the percentage of CD4+ cells is directly measured by flow cytometry, whereas the absolute number is calculated from the absolute and differential white-blood-cell count and the percentage of CD4 4 cells. Fourth, health-care providers who administer aerosol pentamidine as prophylaxis against PCP should be aware of several occupational safety issues. In particular, they should note the recommendation to exclude active pulmonary disease before starting prophylaxis. A recent investigation of M. tuberculosis infections among the staff members of a health clinic in Florida suggested that one source of infection may have related to the use of aerosol pentamidine treatment for two patients who had positive sputum cultures for M. tuberculosis during the time they received aerosol pentami- dine. One of these two patients coughed profusely both during and after therapy (18). Providers administering aerosol pentamidine should also review the manufacturer's instructions for the use of the nebulizer system. The Respirgard II nebulizer contains a filter designed to remove most of the pentamidine from exhaled gases. If the nebulizer is improperly used, substantial amounts of pentamidine can be released into the environment, and health-care workers or others in the vicinity may be at risk for the same adverse events as the patients who received the therapy (19).

In the United States alone, over 35,000 AIDS patients with PCP were treated in 1988. In spite of this plethora of clinical material, the paucity of completed, well-designed clinical trials has led to considerable controversy in optimal therapy and prophylaxis. In this chapter I intend to clarify the pathophysiological basis of PCP, and to review treatment and prophylaxis, including investiga- tional therapies. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PCP P carinii, although currently classified as a protozoan may well be a fastidious fungus.' No environmental saprophytic form has been de- scribed. Asymptomatic primary infection from P carinui presumably occurs in childhood, while pneumonia occurs from reactivation of dormant organisms in the setting of immunosuppreasion.

The degree of immuno- suppression in AIDS patients may be quantified by the CD4 (or T-helper) lymphocyte count, which normally is >1,000 cells/mm3.PCP usu- ally occurs in patients with absolute CD4 counts of <200 cells/mm', although the disease can occur in patients with CD4 counts of >500 cells/mm', especially if they have received con- comitant chemotherapy.23 P carinii parasitizes the surface of the alveolar epithelial cells. The small trophozoites develop into cysts and produce daughter trophozoites that are then released when the cysts burst.' Progressive infection, occurring over days to weeks, usually results in a diffuse alveolar filling process that causes progressive dyspnea, hypox- emia. and an reticulonodular pattern on the chest radiograph.' The degree of severity of altered gas exchange is roughly correlated with survival: a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) of less than 50 torr on admission in patients' breathing room air is associated with 30% to 40% mortality, whereas the mortality is 5% to 10% among patients whose PaO2is greater than 70 torr on ambient air on presentation' 4 Large numbers of P carin i increase the perme- ability of the alveolar The physiologic consequence of increased alveolar capillary permeability is a form of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with luss of surfactant, leading to noncompliant, stiff lungs, and high mortality in the face of therapy with S1i.Rewpto'ykhskra.

This is a severe form of ARDS and antimicrobial therapy may not be the major determinant of outcome in the presence of such severe parenchymal lung injury. Extrapulmonary infection with P carinii is rare; the incidence appears to be less than one case report for every three thousand AIDS pa- tients with PCP. The mechanism of extrapulmo- nary spread is not known. Local spread may occur via the lymphatic system, whereas disease in the ear canals and gastrointestinal (GI) tract implies passage through the airways or gut. On the other hand, infection in the retina and adre- nals suggest blood-borne spread. extrapulmonary pneumocystosis are of- ten occult, and the significance of this condition in terms of patient survival is unclear. STANDARD THERAPY The only therapies currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of PCP are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP- SMX) and purine synthesis inhibition folate metabolism at least affinity than mammalian dihydrofolate reductase.\" SMX interferes with dihydrofolic synthetase, enzyme found in microbes that convert para- aminobenzoic acid to dihydrofolic acid. TMP and SMX are well suited for combina- tion therapy because they also have a broad range of antimicrobial activity, are well absorbed after oral administration, and have similar peak concentrations and half lives. Peak serum levels of both agents occur within one to three hours; the serum saif-life is 12 to are chemically incompat- and therefore require Tdilution:.Even if TMP-SMX solutions are double concentrated, at least I L of free water is administered daily to the average patient, which may cause fluid overload and hyponatremia. The standard dose of TMP/SMX used for PCP is 15 to 20 mg/kg/d TMP with 75 to 100 mg/kg/d SMX given either intravenously (IV) or orally at six-hour intervals.'0'\" Although the upper range dose has been recommended in103 patients with AIDS,7' recent studies have demon- strated that AIDS patients may be treated at the lower range with equal efficacy. In addition, adverse reactions such as neutropenia can be ameliorated by TMP dose adjustment.\" Al- though the optimal duration of treatment for PCP in AIDS patients in not known, TMP-SMX is usually.given for 14 to 21 days. TMP-SMX was used extensively in children and adults with PCP before the AIDS epidemic, with low re- ported rates of toxicity. However, a wide spec- trum and severity of adverse reactions has been reported in AIDS patients.''5-\"3 Forty to 60 percent of AIDS patients with PCP are unable to complete a therapeutic course with TMP-SMX because of adverse reactions, and most other patients experience milder degrees of toxicity.'aIS Common adverse reactions mandating a change of therapy include a rash with exfoliation or mucositis, severe neutropenia, thrombocytope- nia, and chemical hepatitis.\"' Common adverse reactions that mandate close observation and daily laboratory evaluation include lesser degrees of the above reactions as well as nausea, vomit- ing, and hyponatremia. Pentamidine is an aromatic diamidine that was initially synthesized in the 1930s in a search for hypoglycemic agents. Because of its antipro- tozoal activity, pentamidine has been used exten- sively for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of African trypanosomiasis. The exact mechanism of action of pentamidine is not known; in vitro it interferes pentami- dine occur within one hour after parenteral administration; elimination half-life occurs be- tween six and ten hours. Pentamidine has a large apparent volume of distributiondue to avid tissue _uptake.'3The tissue.half-life of pentamidine is moe -than 30 days in the lungs and other tissues.'3\"J Pentamidine usually is given parenterally in a dose of 4 mg/kg/d as. the isethionate salt, the only preparation available in the United States.\" Parenteral administration is necessary because G1 absorption is poor. The drug is best adminis- tered IV over a period of 60 to 90 minutes in 250 mL of 5% dextrose to minimize dose-related hypotension. Intramuscular (IM) administration is not favored due to a high- incidence of sterileA. BRUCE MYONTOMERY abscesses at the injection sites. As with TMP- SMX, the optimal duration of PCP therapy for PCP in AIDS patients is not known. Neverthe- less, 14 to 21 day courses are standard and longer courses may be needed in patients with a slow clinical response. Unfortunately, as occurs with TMP-SMX at standard doses, many patients given pentamidine for more than I week experience adverse reac- tions, 40% to 50% of which are severe enough to require change of therapy.\"\"'l\" Adverse reac- tions to pentamidine appear to be dependent in part on the cumulative dose. A 3-g total dose, which is usually reached in the second week of parenteral therapy, is likely to cause toxicity.'7 The most common adverse reactions are azotemia, hypoglycemia, and neutropenia, the last of which is rarely seen in non-AIDS patients. Other reported reactions include chemical hepa- titis, nausea with vomiting, hypocalemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.'0\"'7Hypoglycemia may result from pentamidine-induced damage to beta cells in the pancreas and has been followed by the development of diabetes mellitus.'7Cardiac ar- rhythmias are rare but are difficult to manage due to the long tissue half-life of pentamidine. The management of adverse reactions requires both anticipation and response. Complete blood counts, and tests of hepatic and renal function are needed at initiation of therapy, and every three days thereafter. Adverse reactions requir- ing change of therapy commonly include exfolia- tive rash or mucositis, neutropenia, thrombocy- topenia, and altered renal or liver function. However, clinicians vary on the acceptable de- gree of severity.0-\"'s\"'7If parenteral pentami- dine is used, blood glucose and blood pressure should be monitored, usually in a supervised clinical setting.7 If a significant adverse reaction develops toeither TMP-SMX or parenteral pentamidine, patients can be switched to the other agent. There are several possible options for patients intolerant to both TMP-SMX and parenteral pentamidine. Rechallenge with TMP-SMX may be worthwhile, especially in situations in which other drugs may have caused or contributed to the adverse reaction. Rechallenge may be helpful if neutropenia occurred during initial treatment because the neutropenia as noted with TMP probably is dose-related.\" However, this ap- proach would not be advisable in patients with a past history of severe exfoliative rash with mucosi- tis: Treatment with the experimental antimicro- bials noted later is another option, although the comparative efficacy of these approaches in pa- tients who are severely ill is not known. Another alternative is to discontinue all drugs if 14 days of therapy has been administered and an adequate clinical response obtained. The frequent need to change therapy has made it difficult to determine the true efficacy of TMP-SMX and pentamidine or both in AIDS patients with PCP (Table I). Of particular interest are the discordant findings in the studies by Wharton et al'0and Sattler et al.\" The former study showed 75% survival in patients random- ized to receive TMP-SMX and 95% survival in those randomized to pentamidine, whereas the latter trial had 86% survival in the patients receiving TMP-SMX and 61% in the patients receiving pentamidine. Neither trial was blinded, which probably is of little consequence when an endpoint such as death is used. Random chance may have favored pentamidine in the Wharton et al trial, which included only 40 patients; Sattler et al entered a greater number of patients, who had second episodes of PCP, in the pentamidine arm. The variability of mortality data in these studies also suggests that severity of respiratory To. I. TP/8IMX mod Pa tWdw for PP h. AIN Wh 012. Rd~s..

This is under- scored by the fact that salvage after initial treatment failure is usually unsuccessful regard- less of antimicrobial agent (Table 1).lI 5 ls Response to therapy, judged by degree of respiratory failure, fever, and chest radiographs is often slow, and many patients continue to deteriorate clinically for several days after treat- ment is started regardless of which antimicrobial agents are administered.'\"' A period of at least four to six days is therefore required before determination of drug failure. Fever, hypoxemia, and dyspnea should be resolved and radiographic improvement should be apparent within 14 to 21 days of treatment. The use of bronchoscopy to assess response is not useful because many pa- tients have persistent organisms in respiratory secretions despite clinical improvement.\" The viability of these persistent organisms is not known because no clinically available stain can distinguish live from dead organisms. It is worth- while to obtain chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests I month after therapy to provide a new baseline should questions of recrudescence occur. ,EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY Pentamidine can be delivered directly to the lungs by aerosolization.?023Because P carini organisms-are almost exclusively intra-alveolar, aerosolized pentamidine with alveolar targeting and binding and low systemic absorption should be as effective and less toxic than parenteral pentamidine.023 The most important factor in giving aerosolized pentamidine probably is the choice of nebulizer. The optimal particle size for alveolar deposition is between I to 2 mm with I Jim achieving more peripheral and less central airway distribution. Therefore, a nebulizer gener- ating I to 2 .im particles with a high output105 would appear to be ideal.20Devices with a reser- voir may increase delivery as the drug concentra- tion on the first part of inspiration is more important than the average concentration; this is because the initial volume inspired will be more peripherally distributed. Many patient factors also affect aerosol deposition, including the rate of inspiratory flow, tidal volume, variations of airway geometry, and presence of other patholog- ical processes.0 Four pilot studies using aerosolized pentami- been conducted (Table 2)..2.4 Mont- gomery et al' studied one group of AIDS pa- tients with PCP who had received no prior therapy22and a second group that was intolerant to standard therapy.23Of the 25 patients treated, 23 recovered. Relapses occurred in only three patients during a mean follow-up period of over I year. No adverse systemic reactions were ob- served during aerosolized pentamidine in either group; coughing was noted in patients with a history of bronchospasm or smoking. This was treated successfully with an aerosolized bronchodilator.22Conte et al23also studied the effects of inhaled or reduced-dose pentamidine treatment of PCP in AIDS patients. Nine of the 13 patients with mild PCP had a satisfactory response to inhaled aerosolized pentamidine; three patients could not be evaluated due to early withdrawal and one patient had treatment fail- ure. Two of the nine evaluable patients had neutropenia, but those patients had been receiv- ing zidovudine (AZT) (Burroughs Wellcome Co, Research Triangle Park, NC) and had low pre- treatment leukocyte counts. Other mild adverse reactions included cough, bronchospasm, rash, and-elevated temperatures. The fourth study was done by Miller and Semple2' who initially re- ported little success with aerosolized pentami- dine using one type of nebulizer, but had better T.ble 2.

These results highlight the importance of aerosol particle size and the need for large. randomized trials before aerosolized pentami- dine can be accepted as standard therapy. Trimethoprim-dapsone (TMP-DAP), another antifolate combination that inhibits purine syn- thesis, has been shown to be effective therapy for PCP in animal models, in an open pilot study, and in a double-blind comparison to TMP- SMX. The pharmacokinetics of this combina- tion appear to be unique in that each drug interferes with the other's metabolism so the optimal dosage regimen is not known. In both clinical studies, only patients with mild to moder- ate PCP were studied, in part because there is no IV preparation of dapsone.\"1 In the open study, 13 of 15 patients responded to TMP-DAP; in the double-blind study, 28 of 30 patients responded compared with 27 of 30 taking oral TMP-SMX (20 mg/kg/d TMP and 100 mg/kg/d SMX). All patients failing to respond to oral TMP-DAP or TMP-SMX responded to standard IV therapy with pentamidine or TMP-SMX. Severe adverse reactions occurred in two of 15 patients in the open pilot study. In the blinded study, nine of 30 patients taking TMP-DAP had severe reactions compared with 16 of 30 taking TMP-SMX. Regardless'of therapy, almost all patients had mild to severe nausea, vomiting, or both. In the open study, TMP dosage was often decreased because of mild rashes, a factor that may have ameliorated some of the toxicity seen in the blinded study. Other adverse reactions reported with TMP-DAP, some severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy, included by- perkalemia, methemoglobinemia (unique to dap- thrombocytopenia. Trimetrexate, unlike trimethoprim, is a and protozoal dihy- drofolate reductase.'2 This agent easily enters both the pneumocyst and mammalian cells due to its lipid solubility. Folinic acid (leukovorin) must be administered as a specific antidote to protect host tissues from toxic antifolate effects. Folinic acid, which is not lipid soluble, is actively trans- ported into mammalian but not into P carinu ceHS. Preliminary studies with trimetrexate, leuko- vorin, and sulfadiazine reveal responses and ad-A. BRUCE MONrGOMERY verse reactions similar to those with TMP- SMX.2' Particularly promising results were seen in patients receiving salvage therapy after failing to respond to standard therapy. Eleven of 16 patients survived, a considerable improvement compared with what has been reported in similar patients in other studies.' Trimetrexate with leukovorin alone appears to be as effective as TMP-SMX and to have fewer adverse reactions. Therefore, this formulation is under active study because it would have a definite advantage over standard therapy. However, a significant relapse rate of PCP occurs within 6 weeks of ending therapy, and current studies are adding a second- ary prophylaxis arm.\" Dimethylluoronithine (DFMO) inhibits orthi- nine decarboxylase and therefore interfere with protein synthesis. This agent has been shown to be\u00b6variably effective in treating rats with PCP. In humans, McLees et al\" reported on salvage therapy with DFMO in 234 patients after treat- ment failure with standard agents. Short-term mortality was high, but 84 of 234 (36%) patients survived. The most common adverse reaction noted was thrombocytopenia. To date, DFMO has not been specifically tested in a large trial without the prior administration of other antimi- crobials; a synergistic or residual effect from tissue-bound pentamidine possible. ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY Three forms of adjunctive therapy-corticoster- oids, positive pressure breathing, and nutrition- are currently advocated for use in AIDS patients with PCP. Putative mechanisms for a beneficial action of corticosteroids include suppression of inflammatory cell influx into the lung, decreasing interstitial edema, respiratory failure with high-dose corticosteroids in ten patients. Despite this response, however, it should be noted that corticosteroids do not improve the outcome of ARDS due to causes other than PCP and may be harmful.'5Possible side effects include second- ary viral pneumonias, especially due to cytomeg- alovirua, or the development of other nonpulmo- nary opportunistic infections from increased immunosuppression. Furthermore, the increased survival in corticosteroid-treated patients may756 PCP IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS reflect other improvements in patient care or early diagnosis. In a prospective double-blind, placebo-con- trolled trial in which 60 mg IV methylpred- nisolone was given every four hours for 48 hours with subsequent taper no statistically increased survival in AIDS patients with severe PCP was seen.3' Duc to the moderate sample size, corticos- teroids cannot be said to be without any possible benefit. Nevertheless, this study established that placebo-controled trials are ethical and should prompt larger trials. Good nutrition is often difficult to provide consistently in AIDS patients. In both animal models and in pediatric patients, starvation ap- pears to be a major cofactor in the onset and outcome of PCP. Indeed, serum albumin concen- trations of <2.0 g/dL are common in patients with severe PCP. Considering the long time required to recover from a severe episode of PCP, early consideration of enteral hyperalimentation may be appropriate. However, AIDS patients often selectively malabsorb fat emulsions that are the major components of many tube feedings and supplemental diets. Therefore, a high carbo- hydrate diet is probably superior in such patients. Alternatively, parenteral hyperalimentation is sometimes needed. Oxygen is an important adjunctive therapy in PCP. Unfortunately, the high concentrations of oxygen required for some patients cannot be provided with standard tightly fitting reservoir face masks. One option is continuous positive airway pressure that provides not only a high oxygen concentration but also positive airway .pressure that additionally improves oxygenation. The drawback to this approach is that the masks are uncomfortable to wear and may cause nasal bridge pressure necrosis. Another, easily toler- ated approach is giving a high flow of oxygen at 50 L/min and using rebreathing whiskers with a standard face mask. Patients who cannot be oxygenated by these methods usually require intubation and mechanical ventilation. PROPHYLAXIS Continued exponential growth in the incidence of PCP is expected, unless effective prophylaxis for this disease is developed and implemented. In 1990 alone, 40,000 to 60,000 cases of first- episode PCP are expected in the United States asnoted earlier. Furthermore, the annual number of repeat PCP episodes from AIDS patients surviving from prior years will increase this total by 30%. The mortality for each occurrence is 10% to 30% in patients ill enough to be hospitalized.32 The risks of recurrent PCP have been assessed by historical studies and in ongoing clinical trials of zidovudine. Analysis of 201 consecutive pa- tients with first-episode PCP at San Francisco General Hospital has shown that 61 (30%) re- lapsed with PCP. The cumulative of incidence relapse in survivors was 18% at 6 months, 46% at 9 months, and 65% at 18 months.32Most patients with a second episode of PCP are expected to relapse within 18 months. The above data were collected prior to the introduction of zidovudine when competing mortality limited the absolute numbers of second-episode PCP. Although zi- dovudine decreases primary PCP,33comparison of the relapse rates of PCP before and after zidovudine became available suggests that, al- though the risk of PCP may be slightly decreased in individual patients, overall risk is increased because patients live longer with AIDS.' Unblinded or uncontrolled trials of various therapeutic regimens including TMP-SMX, oral pyrimethamine sulfadoxine, oral dapsone, and parenteral pentamidine in AIDS patients have been reported to decrease the recurrence of PCP compared with historical or concurrent controls.3\"' A common finding in all studies is that primary prevention trial require larger num- ber of patients due to the lower incidence of PCP in this group compared with that observed during prophylaxis following an episode of PCP. TMP-SMX provides effective prophylaxis when given twice daily every day and three days per week in children with hematological malig- nancies who were receiving chemotherapy.'40' The children on the three-times-a-week regimen had a lower incidence of systemic fungal infec- tions but other. toxicity was similar. Previous investigators have had difficulty in administering chronic TMP-SMX to patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) because of dose- limiting toxicity including nausea, vomiting, rash, fever, or marrow suppression.3' Nevertheless, a regimen consisting of twice daily TMP-SMX double-strength tablets with 5 mg folinic acid was recently shown to provide effective primary107A. BRUce MONTHLRY prophylaxis for Kaposi's pa- tients suffered minor toxicity and 17% suffered dose-limiting toxicity. The investigators contin- ued treatment despite the development of skin rash, a condition that prompts most physicians to discontinue the drug. Whether this regimen would be beneficial to AIDS patients receiving zidovu- dine is difficult to assess, given the possibility of bone marrow suppression from both agents.'\u00b0\"42 Furthermore patients requiring secondary pro- phylaxis may have been sensitized to sulfa agents during their treatment for PCP and may there- fore manifest greater toxicity.'0 Another antifolate combination, 25mg py- rimethamine plus 500 mg sulfadoxine has been administered once a week to a group of patients.' After a mean follow-up time of II months (range: 3 to 27 months) only five of the 60 patients in this study experienced a second epi- sode of PCP. In six patients, pyrimethamine sulfadoxine was discontinued because of rash. Anecdotal reports of lack of clinical efficacy and of the development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in several patients have discouraged prospective trials of this agent.37In addition, as an antifolate, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine could also cause ditive or synergistic marrow suppression with zidovudine. Parenteral pentamidine has also been given prophylactically in 4 mg/kg doses once a month. This approach appears promising, but toxicity should be expected after a cumulative dose of 3 g as noted earlier.\" Another potential prophylactic agent is dapsone, a sulfone.' The efficacy of dapsone as secondary prophylaxis of PCP in a controlled trial has not been reported. Because the incidence of toxicity in AIDS patients receiv- ing high-dose dapsone therapy for PCP are well' known, it must be determined whether low or intermittent dosage can provide effective prophy- laxis with acceptable levels of adverse reactions, especially anemia. Aerosolized pentamidine is also a promising regimen for prevention of PCP in AIDS patients.\"s In the largest study of this agent to date, Leoung et al`3 followed 439 patients with either prior PCP (n -250), Kaposi's Sarcoma (n -59), or ARC (n -129). Patients were randomized to receive either 30, 150, or 300 mgof aerosolized pentamidine using the Respirgard 11 Nebulizer System. The 30 and 150 mg doses were administered every 2 weeks; the 300-mg dose was given evesy 4 weeks. The once monthly 300-mg regimen was superior to the 30-mg regimen (P < .001) in that only 13 episodes of PCP were observed in the patients receiving the former regimen compared with 27 patients receiv- ing the latter over a mean follow-up time ap- proaching I year. The once monthly regimen also tended to be more superior than the 150-mg regimen (Dave Feigal, personal communication). The absolute benefit of aerosolized pentamidine in secondary prophylaxis will never be known because the apparent benefits of the aerosol probably will preclude placebo studies. Neverthe- less, based on a recurrence rate of up to 60% per year in historical controls, the relative protection from aerosolized pentamidine may be as high as tenfold. Aerosolized pentamidine does not provide per- fect prophylaxis; however, most cases of relapse are mild with a case fatality rate of <5%. Lowery et al' reviewed. the; on low-dose aerasolized pent- amidine and found a striking increase of upper lobe relapses, an observation that correlates with the predicted deposition of most of the drug in the better-ventilated lower lobes.\" The best breathing patterns would be those that encour- age apical deposition such as exhalation to resid- ual volume followed by-full inspiration or chang- ing positions. Breath holding at increased lung volumes that decreases apical deposition would not be useful. The use of aerosolized pentamidine in primary prophylaxis is logical based on the above data if a high-risk population can be identified. As noted before, a CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3was present in most patients with PCP 2 months prior to their initial episode.2As CD4 counts have some inherent variability and are expensive to check frequently, institution of prophylaxis is probably appropriate at levels somewhat above 200 cells/mm'. Because the long-term conse- quences of aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis are not known, admiinistering the drug to patients at low risk (CD4 above 500 cells/mm3and no other immunosuppressive therapy) -90 -25108757758 side effects of aerosolized pentami- cause permanent airflow obstruction or a reduc. dine reported to date occur at a frequency of tion in diffusing capacity.

(612-927-2039) 19\u00b09 Michael O'Brien, RPh, MS. Allan Aramson, MD.- ADVERSE DRUG With the increased interest in the medical community about outcomes of care, the ADE reporting EVENT (ADE) system of the FDA has assumed more importance as a possible tooL Collection and analysis of REPORTING ADE reports could 1) provide early warnings of previously undetected, serious drug risks, 2) directly change recommendations for a drug's use, 3) help profile types of reactions occuring for a group of dregs or 4) provide information on patient risk factors. What is a 'serious' ADE? To date, the FDA defines a serious ADE as an event that is associated with one or more of the following death, new or prolonged hospitalizationpermanent or severe disability, congenital anomaly, cancer or overdose. By law, all physicians are required to report serious vaccine or toxoid ADEs directly to the FDA. If voluntary reporting of other drugs inceased, the FDA's information would be more useful and timely. Physicians must recognize that all the effectas of new drugs have not born elucidated at the time of maketing. MedCenters Health Plan encourages physicians to report 'serious adverse drug events directly to the FDA, with FDA form 1639. If the task is deemed inconvenient, other health care professionals such as nurses or pharmacists can assist the physician in the reportung process. Documentation of anl ADE should be made in the patient's medical record to prevent future problems. Please direct questions or requests for ADE reports form 1639 to Donna Schmidt (612) 927-2039. Direct questions to the FDA can be called to (301) 443-4580. COMMUNITY The majority of community-acqunired pnernmonias that occur in healthy ambulatory adults, are ACQUIRED caused by a variety of pathogens sack as mycoplasma, bacteria, viruses, chlamydia, rickettsial-like PNEUMONIAS organisms and even parasites. Of these Mycoplasma paeumonia is considered the most common (ADULT) etiologic pathogen. Recent reports suggest that Legionella and Chlamydial speces may account for a good portion of these pneumonias. However, most CAP hospital admissions consist primarily of patients older than 65 years. The average length of stay for these patients is 11.5 days and the fatality rate was 12.3 per 100 hospital discharges Pneumonia is still ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States with a mortality rate of 30-50%. Because seniors are more prone to influenza associated pncumonias they should be vaccinated each fall. One reason management of CAP is so difficult is the variety of potentially causative pathogens. Streptococcus pnenmonia accounted for 65% of the cases in the 1960's, but now reports show that it accounts for only 36%. The percent of pneumonia caused by L pnermnophilia, H. influenza,P. aeruginosa and others have substantially increased. This change of pathogens is reflected by a change in the usual effective drug therapy. Aher assessing the elinical situation or identifying the pathogen, choices of an oral antibiotic are listed in the table following.761 AvERaGE WHlOLESALE PRICE OF 10D-DAY 7PPTY OF which may increase risk of CAP in the elderly have been raised.

Dean Smith, MD. Newsletter The Drun Updae is a monthly newsletter written to Butterworth HMO Health Plan physicians and Format pharmacies to provide current information regarding rational and economical prescribing, formulary changes and dreg therapy reviews. The newsletter is written in a summary format to minimize demands on the reader's time. Documentation and detailed information supporting condusions is available upon request. Readers may wish to file the Druz Undate in a three ring hinder, for future reference. Formulary A pocket sized copy of Butterworth HMO formulary will be mailed to all physicians and pharmacies. The formulary consists of four major parts the introduction in the first 11 pages, a negative formulary, medication index, and maintenance medication list. The formulasy is basically an open system, meaning that, drugs not listed either on the negative formulary or the medication index are still reimbursed by the Plan. The drugs listed are meant to be used as a gaide in prescribng for this first year. Over the next year, the formulary will gradually change to a dosed system where drugs not listed will not be reimbursed. Within each therapeutic dass is a listng of drugs with a relative cost index preceding the name. The greater the number of 'es, the more expensive is the drug. In addition, dregs with the same number of 'es' are listed from least to most expensive. This cost index was included to facilitate economical choices of therapy. Negative Induded within the formulary is a one-page list of drugs which are not covered by the Plan. When the Formulary physician prescribes a dreg on this list and the iharmacist cannot dispense a covered equivalent, the pharmacist should contact the physician for an alternative. If no alternative exists, the pharmacist will inform the member that the prensciption is not reimbursable by the Health Plan. In that case, the member is responsible for the entire cost of the presription. Items will be added and deleted from this list periodically with notification given to prescribers in the Drng Update. Generic Butterworth HMO maintains a list of dregs for which pharmacists are required to substitute generic Substitution equivalents if they receive a prescription written by brand name. A maximum allowable cost (MAC) has been assigned to each drug on this list (MAC list). The drugs induded on the MAC list are marked with an asterisk (-) in the formulary.763 Manufacturers of generic drugs must document that the product is biocquivulext to the brand name product in order to acquire marketing approval from the FDA. Although the FDA allows a statistical variability of +20% for evaluation of boequivalency in human blood level studies, the average observed differences between generic and brand name products has been about + 3.5%. Most importantly, the FDA is not aware of a tingle documented case of bioiuequivnlerne involving any generic drug product that has bees approved by the FDA as biowquivaletL In addition, the Bioequalence Task Force of the FDA has just recently concluded that there was a remarkable lack of hard evidence aubstantiatiag elaims of bioequivalency problems with generic drugs. Therefore, Butterworth HMO Health Plan is comfortable with requiring generic substitution for those products incuded on our maximum allowable coust (MAC) list Some drugs for which generic equivalents are available have been intentionally excuded from the MAC list. These products include L osxia, Dilantin, Tegretol, Procan SR, sustained release theophyuies, Synthroid, Premarin and Provera. If a physician wants the brand name product to be dispensed for a drug marked with an asterisk in the fomulary, (s)he must write dispense as written (DAW) on the prescriptionu Otherwise a generic product will be dispensed. For evesy DAW prescription, the physician must write a patient specific letter to the Health Plan regarding the medical reason(s) the brand name product is needed. Maintenance The Health Plan's policy states that membets may not receive more than a 30 day supply of any Medication medication. Exceptions to this policy are drugs specifically listed on the maintenance medication list. Items on this list may be dispensed in masimum quantities of a 30 day supply or 1OO units, whichever is greater, but should not enceed a 100 day supply. This list is intentionall restrictive. Drug Use A formalized drug use review program authorized by PARTNERS Pharmacy and Therapeutics Review Committee will be implemented this month. The goal of this system is to assure the quality and efficiency of drug use by increasing physician awareness of efficacy, safety and cost issues. This program's goal is to minimine needlems expenditure of resources by elimining care which does not increase quality or improve outcome and recommendations regarding these issues can be made to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. Efforts will fomas on the top fifty prescription drugs to determine those target drugs which have less expensive, equally safe and eferacious alternatives. Physician who are frequent prescribers of expensive medications, such as terfenadine (Seldane) and cefaclor (Ceclor), can expect letters from PARTNERS which identify alternative drugs which may be appropriate in many instances. PARTNERS will also provide physicians with other reports, such as their non-formulaty and controlled substances prescribing habits. Physicians can use this information as a tool to identify formulary alternatives, evahnate their own prescribing patterns and monitor incidence of undesirable outcomtes.764 JUNE 1989 Editmsm DonnaSchmidt, date Allan A. U MedCustena Phasmacy and Therapeutis Committee has made may formulasg decsions Many drua were not added to the formulary because they did not offer any therapeutic advantage over the current formulary drugl The following chart is a summary of the formulary dedstions KEY: F -formulary R n restricted NF -nonformulary NC -ncovered RA = prior authorization indicated for the treatment of hypereension alone or with other .antihypertensives. It was added to the formulary due to the relative advantages of diltiazem's least negtive inotropic effects and low incidence of constipation when compared to verapamil. Its usage is limited to paticant for whom those aide effects might prove troublesome. Dosing recommendations 90 mg to 180 mg BID. DICLOFENAC Didofteac (Volaren) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory auhrit, osteoartbrit pondylit The Committee recommends prescribing other drugs efore didofenac, but since it does have s possible role for some patients, it has been added to the formulary. The starting dose for osteoarthritis is 50 mg BID which would cost S40.80 for a mont's supply. ASTEMIZOLE Astemizole (Hrismanal) isa long-acting antihistamine. Since the drug would need to be discontinued for 45 days before alleWr visits or attempts at pregnaney due to ih long half life, it was not added to the formulary. Terfenadine (Seldanc) is dan (as are ibupofe & naprozen). It offers no major therapeutic: pi in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or ostcarthritis, so it was not added to the formulay. DESIPRAM E Desipramine has boen removed from our trrent Maximum Allowable Co (MACP) L This allows the physidan to write for a braed name desipramixie (ie.

Cytotec hasbeen approved for prevention of NSAIDrindaced gastric ukers in patients with a high risk ofcomplitioc from a gastric alter. It has no effect compared to placebo on patrointestinal pain or discomfort assodated with nonsteroidal us. It has not been proven to prevent GI bleod with nonsteriodals. Most atudies of miaoprostol have been in with doodenal or pstric ulcers unrelated to nsonserioda!s. 1I hes been about as effective as 'dietidine or ranitidine in promoting the healing of duodenal or gstric ulcers, but less effective in relieving pain. misoprentolalso has a much higher inddence of adverse reactiounsid , abdominal pai, heada , blending in early pregnancy, with partial or complete expulion of uterine contents. Recommended dosage is 200m QID with meals for the duralion of the NSAID therapy. Cost for one months sUPply at this dose is S9 70.

Leonard Nordstrom, M.D. Donald Duncan, M.D. Donna Schmidt, Pharm.D. INTRODUCTION Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are among the most widely prescribed therapeutic agentsavailable today. Owing to the number of available agents and variability of drug properties, bera-blockers demonstrate utility in a variety of disease states. The following introduction to the basicproperties of this drug class is designed to facilitate beller clinical utility of these agents for a givenpatienL CARDIO Cardioseleetive beta-blockers are those agents which preferentially block receptors lowerSELECTilY doses Although atenolol, metoprolol, and acebutolol are cardioselective, they are notcardiospecifie. They have a lower potential to increase airway resistance but are not free of thisside effect. Beta-blockers even those with annarent eardioseleetivitc should not be used in natientswith asthma or a history oF obstrucive airway disease untess no alternative treatment is available. Patients who have a tendency towards obstructive airway disease or asthma must be treated withgreat caution and may require increased doses of their beta-2 agonists to overcome the blockade ofthe bronchial adrenoceptors.HVPOGLYCENIA Beta-blocken may diminish glucose tolerance in diabetics. They also interfere with metabolic and autonomic responses'to hypoglycemia. Though beta-blockers are not contraindicated for diahbeics,their use is best avoided in those who experience frequent episodes of hypoglycemia. Otherdiabetics requiring beta-blocker therapy generally experience fewer side-cffects with thecardioselective agents. ISA Intrinsic sympathomometic activity (ISA) represents the capacity of bela-blockers to stimulate aswell as to block adrenergic receptors. Drugs demonstrating ISA (+) are useful in patientsintolerant of further reductions in heart rate or patients who already have low HDL or hightriglyceride levels. Pindolol and carteolol exhibit greater ISA than penbutolol and acebutolol. ALPRA Labetatol with its alpha blocking properties tends to lower blood pressure without a reflcxBLOCKADE tachycardia or significant reduction in heart rate. In fact, it may have the potential to tosscrperipheral resistance. In spite of these effects, labetalol lacks any major advantages over the otherbeta blockers The following figure illustrates the various properties of beta blockers. Bela-Adrenoceptor Blocking Drugs Non-Selective Selective With Alpha-Blocking Activity ISA ISA ISA ISA (Esmolol) * Primary renal excretion, more water soluble, less sleep disturbance, change dosage intcrvalin renal failure o Primarily hepalic metabolism, more lipid soluble (and more CNS side effects)767 HYPERTIENSION Beta-blocr are effective antehypeteanc drugs but ther mode of acsion is mot completely understood. However, the coflleive c of bet-lock in reducing cardiac output, altering b eepo relae nt ty and blockg peripheral adrenoceptors are unquestionably thir aantyperteasive effectiveas Some bea-bloketrs depress plasma resn t blood pressue can msually be costrolled with relatively fe. side effects. In general the dose of beta-blker does not have to be as high as originally thought Tme masnmum dose of propranolol is probably 32Dmg daily.

ANGINA Beta-blockers ipre eorcin tolerance and relieve symptoms in patiets with agin, this effect caused by their reduction of cardiac work. No single drug is superior to another in this class. though occasionally a patient will respond better to one beta-blocker than to another. There is some evidence that sudden withdrawal may cause macerbation of angina, therefore gradual reduction of dcse is preferable when beta-blockers are to be stopped. There is a risk of precipitating beast failure when beta-blocers and yern amd or diltiazem are used together in patients with established ismic beart d-as. COST As demonstrated in the table below, there is considerable cost variance amongst beta-blockers, since only Inderal is generically available Table 1.

SELECIION Some of the beta-blockers we have beeun discussing are nuot covered by the plan. The two beta-blockers which are most useful are powanljoi and atenold These drugs should be cousidered fist when choosing a beta blocker.

Schousboe M.D. A condensed version from the Bulletin Vol 32 No.1 1988 November 1989 Editors: Cynthia Anderson, Phart.D. (612) 897-2939 Edward J. Smith, M.D. Use Of Nonsteroldal Anti- Inflammatory DrugsA review of the therapeutic use, toxicology and cost of good NSAIDs is timely for many reasons. Fast, despite their widespread use, the mechanisms of action of NSAIDs and their relation to the therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs remains incompletely understood. Second, there is now a bewildering eumber of these agents on the market, but no clear guidelines regarding their selection in specified clinical situations. Third, some data has emerged in the last decade defining the side effects of these drugs, and some potential differences among them. Most authors over the past 15 years have ascribed the therapeutic efficacy of NSAIDs to their ability to inhibit cyclo oxygenase and thereby prostaglandin synthesis. Certain prostaglandins play a ignilicant role in the development of inflammation and pain by increasing vascular permeability and stimulation of pain nerve endings by kinin. However, there is some evidence that prostaglandin synthesis inhibition may not be the only mechamum. Therapentic In both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis no single subgroup of NSAIDs have been Uses shown consistenty more effective than others, but for individual patients certain NSAIDs may be more effective. For anklosinz soondylitii indomethacin and naprocen were more effective than fenoprofen, ibuprofen, tolmetin, with aspirin as the least effective. Large dosages (150.200 mg QD indomethacin or 1500 mg QD naproxen) are needed initially and then after two to three days the dosage is lowered and then tapered off over 5 to 10 days. In acute got salicylates are clearly less effective and should not be used. Cost While there may be a few differences among the NSAIDs in efficacy in arthritis illnesses, and only slight differences in toxicity profiles, there are considerable differences in the cost of these agents. Most of the NSAIDs cost two or more times as much as aspirin products and generic ibuprofen and indomethad. As a therapeutic class, NSAIDs are consistently in the top three classes by cost and volume at PARTNERS Health Plan of the MidAtlantic. Our choice of NSAIDs for our patients should be carefully considered, because many patients remain on NSAIDs for years, generating high drug costs. TABLE I Average Wholesale Price for 30 day supply of NSAIDs Enteric coated ASA 1.95 gm BID Ibuprofen 800 mg TID Indomethactn 50 mg TID Salsalate 1.5 gm BID Naproxen 500 mg BID Fenoprofen 600 mg TID Ketoprofen 75 mg TID Sulindac 200 mg BID Tolmetin 400 mgTID Piro]scam 20 mg QD Diclofenac 75 mg somewhat unpredictable efieacy in any ore individual, a trial of a few or even several is sonets necessary before finding one tsat reasonably reduces the patient's pain and inflammation. These agents generally will exbibit their fuol therapeutic effect within one to two weeks and a trial one of these medicines for chronic pain or arthritis need not exceed this time perixL Table 2 shows PARTNERS Health Plan of the MidAtlantic preferred sequence of NSAIDs to be tried for most patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis. This list emphaises the least expensive agents first, which is reasonable in the absence of compelling differences between them in terms of effacacy, convenience or toxicity.

NSAID is preferable to use in patients with a history of peptic ulceration or symptomatic gastric irritation? It appears ewar that enteric-coated aspirio is preferable to plain or buffered aspirin. Some authors have asserted that NSAIDs with short half-lives may be less ulcerogenic in the elderly, but there is no firm data to conftrm this hypothesis. Perhaps the safest of these drugs, especially in the presence of active peptic ulcer, are the nonacetylated salicylates such as salsalate and choline magnesium trisalicyiate. Another strategy for patients who have had gastric side effects with NSAIDs is to administer them along with an H2 antagonist Unfortunately, to date there has not been much documentation that this is particularly eflicadious. PARTNERS Health Plan of the MidAttic recommends that H2 blokede not be routinely prescribed tor prevention of NSAID pgstropathy, except in selected padents. 31-352 0 -90 -26770 Drg Updte TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS IN ADULTS: SPOTLIGHT ON CECLOR Editors Cynthia A. Anderson, PhantD. (612) 897-2939 John Shevlin, RYIL Paul Berger, MD. CECLOR is a broad spectrum antibiotic finding particular tility in pedintric otitiw media therapies where rotation of drugs is requred to adequately treat the chronically reinfected child and avoid resistant organism development. CECLOR's place in treating adult respiratory infections is less weIl-established, however. In fact, CECLOR fails to appear as drug of choice in the Guide to Antimicrobial Theran. 1989 by Jay P. Sanford, M.D. for treatment of infections at any body site. Despite this, prctcribing of CECLOR capsules significantly outnumbered prescriptions for CECLOR snson at PARTNERS Health PIan of Georgia in second quarter, 1989. What follows is a brief review of the common etiologies, treatments and therapy costs of adult respiratory infections. BRONCHITIS Acute bronchiti in adolescents and adults free of underlying host defects is most commonly caused by Myojtlasm Erythromycin is the agent of choice for creating this microbe. Occasionally, H. innflnz is the causative organism and is successfully treated with amnsoxialin or ampitillin. Chronic bronchitis patients usually demonstrate the dual problem of inadequate host defenses and bss predictable causative organisms. However, the vast majority of insulting microbes are S. pneumonin H. influena or LB.ctatrrhal Amonidian and ampicillin will succesduly these infections, with tetracycline and TMP/Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) listed as alternative therapies. Augmentin (amosicillin/tiavulanate) may occasionally be called upon for treatment of beta-lactamase positive IL influenz or B. cat iil. PROPHYLAXIS The advisability of prophylactic treatment for chronic bronchitis is stilt debatable. If prophylasis is deemed appropriate, rotation of agents is required to discourage developufb t of resisant org PNEUMONIA Commanity-acquired bronchopneumonia in otherwist-healthy adults is with S. &nmrmjoi Mroplasmi Letdia or Erythrom. aythsncyin is the drug of choice for treating these microbes, with tetracycline listed as an alternatv Commmity-acqutied pneuonias in patients having chronic bronchitis should be treated according to the chronic bronchitis regimen listed above. CECLOR CECLOR, while comparable to Augmentin in its ability to eradicate infections due to B. catarrhalis and beta-lactamase positive H. influenza, is not recommended as either drug of choice or alternative choice in treating adult respiratory infections. As Table 1 demonstrates, the Cost of 10-day CECLOR therapy is significantly higher than those associated with other therapies mentioned above and detailed in Table 2.

DRUG: Fluconazole (Diflucan, Pfizer) IAA from some of the other antifungal agents in that it is atriazole containing three nitrogens in its azole ring. V. PRNRMACOLOGYs Triazole agents are pharmacologically similar toimidazole agents. The primary mechanism of action is inhibition ofergosterol biosynthesis resulting in an accumulation of precursorintermediates to ergosterol. The compound may also cause directdamage to membrane phospholipids. Further, fluconazole may inhibitcytochrome C oxidative perioxidative enzymes resulting inincreases in intracellular peroxide generation. Fluconazole has been observed to efficacious vivo after oraladministration reaching peak plasma concentrations 2-6 hours afterdosing. It has a volume of distribution of 0.8 L/kg and is only 11% protein bound. The bioavailability of fluconazole following oraladministration has been measured to be over 90%. Fluconazole penetrates the CNS. The concentration at and 88.7% at 10mg/day regardless of meningial inflammation (1,4). There appears to be a prolonged half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid. Serum half-life is 22 hours,allowing once daily administration. Fluconazole is primarilyrenally eliminated with over 90% of the administered dose unchangedin the urine. The elimination half-life is prolonged in patientswith renal deficiency. VII. INDICATIONS: Fluconazole is approved by the FDA for treatment oforopharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and cryptococcalmeningitis. Fluconazole is also indicated for the treatment ofserious systemic candida infections including urinary tractinfections, peritonitis EFPECTS: In clinical trials, fluconazole has been welltolerated. The most common adverse reactions reported are nausea,abdominal pain, and headache. Reversible elevation in LFTs has beenreported.773 Drug Review Fluconazole Page 2 X. DRUG Fluconazole may increase cyclosporin, Controlled and ketoconazole in treatment of orapharyneal candidiosis in patients with AIDS. Cultures were negative in 87% of the fluconazole group and 69% of the ketoconazole group. A blinded open-label, multicenter study compared fluconazole and clotrimazole and reported 96% cure rate for 89% rate for clotrimazole. XII. DOSING INFORHATION: For systemic candidiasis, the recommended dose is 400mg load followed by 200mg/day for a minimum of 4 weeks. For cryptococcal meningitis, 400mg load followed by 200mg to 400mg/day for 10 to 12 weeks after the CSF becomes culture negative. Dose should be reduced in patients with renal deficiency. For prophylaxis against fungal meningitis and relapse, treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. 2. Add fluconazole to formulary. RESERVED when used for the treatment of oropharyngeal, esophageal, or systemic candidiasis. Adequate trials of clotrimazole and/or ketoconazole must be attempted prior to Mycelex troches and Ketoconazole OR 3.
