A nutritional deficiency means that you have abnormally low levels of one or more nutrients. Because each vitamin, mineral, and nutrient is designed to work hand-in-hand with one another, if you're deficient in one, chances are, another nutrient can't do its job efficiently. You can develop a nutritional deficiency due to: - Malabsorption issues, including Crohn's disease - Poor or imbalanced diet - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) medications - Hormone (estrogen or testosterone) imbalances - Thyroid or pituitary gland disorders It's important to understand the signs and symptoms of a nutritional deficiency, so if you start noticing symptoms, you can get treatment right away before your condition worsens. What are the symptoms of a vitamin or mineral deficiency? Abnormally low vitamin or mineral levels \u2014 or other nutrients \u2014 can lead to a multitude of non-specific symptoms, so you might (initially) be unaware that you have a deficiency. Common signs and symptoms include: - Dry skin or brittle hair - Slow healing wounds - Chronic fatigue - Digestive disorders - Muscle weakness - Sleep problems If any of this sounds familiar, Gordon Hart, PA-C, and the specialized wellness team at Balance Hormone Center can help. They can diagnose you right in the office and determine which nutritional vitamin and mineral supplements you need. Plus, if they discover that you have a hormonal imbalance that could be triggering your nutrient deficiency, they can provide effective hormone replacement therapy (HRT) solutions. Which nutritional vitamins and supplements do I need? It depends on which nutrient you're deficient in and the severity of your symptoms. Your dedicated practitioner at Balance Hormone Center may suggest starting with once-a-week intravenous (IV) therapy sessions to boost your nutrient levels. IV therapy is beneficial because it quickly gets essential vitamins and minerals into your body, without requiring digestion. Since they're quickly absorbed directly in your bloodstream, vitamins and minerals administered through IV therapy can resolve symptoms rather quickly. You may also need over-the-counter clinical-grade dietary supplements. Gordon Hart, PA-C, and the team at Balance Hormone Center can help you select nutritional supplements that are best suited for your specific needs.
