Thanks to Dr. Richards for his being able to convey my EVP report today while I am unable t o attend . I wanted to share some on -going and exciting work happening in UNM Health and specific to UNM Hospitals. \"Listening and Learning Tour\" of my first 90 days: Over the past 90 days I have had the opportunity to continue to meet, listen and learn from many adm inistrative leaders, faculty, students, and staff in our health system and health sciences campus, including recently providing a more comprehensive report to the UNM Regents several weeks ago. Last Friday I initiated a new Health System Executive Lead ership Group that includes the Senior Vice Chancellor of Clinical Affairs, CEOs of the Health System Entities and UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Dean of the School of Medicine. We were able to review the October 2019 UNM Health Systems retreat summ ary, and I was able to share my reflections on what were my observations in the past 90 days and some initial thoughts on our Health System, including planning an updated strategic planning process. At our next meeting I will be able to provide more detai l regarding this effort and also how this will align with the UNM \"One University\" Strategic Planning process. \"LEADing To Excellence\" (LET) half -day event: Since our last UNMH BOT, I was able to meet with about 1000 UNM clinical system leaders from all disciplines and specialties, including faculty, clinicians, staff, and administrative leaders. This was a great opportunity for me to thank everyone for their leadership and impact, answer questions, and share about myself, reflections on the first 60 days, and some initial perspectives on critical issues and opportunities for our health care system. The event was filled with fun, tears of joy, and much learning about our current activities, new programs to support our patients, families, and one an other, and leadership training on ways to be more effective and enhance our communication and impact. There were many points of pride shared at the meeting. Issues coming into focus for the next year include: COVID & Health Care System transformations - New Tower/Primary Care, Patient experience and quality, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - Health Equity, Anti -racism, & Workforce / Learners, Primary Care and Population Health expansion, Wellness and Work Environment, greater collaboration with main cam pus, and increasing career development, academic activities, and Workforce development. Our primary focus on providing compassionate, state -of-the-art, quality patient care that is accessible and improves the lives of all New Mexicans is most vital. Education I wanted to express my gratitude for all those involved in helping the School of Medicine obtain full accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education . This is a major accomplishment and ensures that we continue as the on ly academic health center in the 16/40state. This accreditation covers our 60+ residency and fellowship programs and is essential to our mission. Diversity I want to thank the leadership at UNMH and across campus who put on some excellent Black History Month events . I also wanted to mention that the HSC Inclusive Excellence Council, under the HSC Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, has been formed and will start working on how we can continue to grow, learn from each other and make meaningful change to wards a more inclusive and supportive environment. We look forward to also making sure the IEC is able to listen to all the voices, including those who feel invisible and historically not heard or represented. There will be many opportunities for others not on the council to be actively involved, including through subcommittees and other work groups. Exciting News UNM's stroke program has officially been accredited by the Joint Commission as the First Comprehensive Stroke Center in N ew Mexico. This is a m ajor accomplishment that was years in the making and I want to thank Dr. Michel Torbey, Chair of Neurology, and his entire staff who have been working on this designation. Thank a Resident and Fellow Today is a very big day! Please take a moment to thank a Resident or Fellow as part of national Thank You day! Vaccinations Continue Just also wanted to touch on the work still happening at The Pit. We have administered more than 36,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine as of last week. Just an incredible accomplishment and we are ready to ramp up that effort as soon as more shipments of vaccines come to New Mexico. We are working with the state and other health care partners on how the Johnson and Johnson vaccine could be utilized. More news to come on tha t next month. Thank you again for the work you all do and your commitment to our institution. I am truly grateful for your service , leadership, and support . Best wishes.

Native American Liaison: UNMH is pleased to announce the planned opening of our first permanent UNMH clinic in Gallup, NM! We anticipate opening in mid -March 2021 pending regulatory cleara nce. The UNMH Gallup clinic will extend specialty services to Northwest New Mexico, serving greater Gallup, Zuni Pueblo, and the Navajo area. This helps us to fulfill our mission as a specialty care provider in New Mexico. Outpatient referrals from tribal healthcare entities to UNMH increased over the last quarter, nearing pre -Covid referral patterns. In early February, UNMH met with Albuquerque Area I.H.S. (AAIHS) to review progress on wait -times within certain subspecialty clinics; of note, wait times fo r Native American patients has decreased by 6% during 3rd quarter 2020. Our quarterly report on referrals is due to AAIHS in April 2021. UNMH continues to work with the State of NM HSD Medical Assistance Division to capture and report visits eligible for 100% Federal Match. We recently completed a care coordination agreement with 638 Tribal Facility Fort Defiance Indian Hospital. UNM has reached out to Laguna Healthcare Corporation, a new 638 healthcare entity for Laguna Pueblo, as we directly coordinate care and claims for Laguna pueblo members. The new calendar year brings new leadership and change within tribal governments. Several pueblos have new governors this year: Zia, Cochiti, Isleta, Santa Ana, and Ohkay Owingeh. Our team at Native American Hea lth Services has reached out to offer 1:1 orientation for new pueblo leaders. Additionally, a key person at Albuquerque Area I.H.S. is retiring, so we will work closely with AAIHS as they bring in new leaders. Last, there has been turnover at APCG Inc, the administrative arm of the All Pueblo Council of Governors, with Amber Carrillo assuming the executive director role from interim Pam Mahooty. We formally requested our annual Spring consultative visit with APCG and are awaiting confirmation to appear as an agenda item at the APCG monthly meeting on April 22, 2021. 27/40Page 2 Bernalillo County: A Request for Proposal for architectural services for the proposed Crisis Triage center was issued in late January and closed on February 15, 2021. A selection committee with representatives from UNMH and Bernalillo County will evaluate responses and sel ect an architect during March 2021. In addition UNMH and Bernalillo County have initiated planning for the next phase of Behavioral Health program development which would focus on gaps in the system and expanding capacity. Bernalillo County, IHS and UNM H representatives will meet in early March to review and update the status of deliverables under the UNMH Lease Agreement prioritized in Exhibit C of the MOU. If there are any questions on this or other matters, please feel free to contact me. 28/40Separator Page UNMH Irene Agostini, MD UNMH Chief Medical Officer The CMO Board report for February will highlight the successful Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) survey, COVID -19 demobilization and Vaccines at the Pit.

The number of progressive care COVID patients has decreased dramatically and we are now better able to provide much of the delayed care that happened during the pandemic. We are now down to three units that house COVID -19 patients. The BBRP operating room, previously used for adult intensive care during COVID -19, has returned to treatin g pediatric patients . We are currently utilizing all three operating suites (BBRP, OSIS and Main) at full capacity. Because of the amount of delayed care over the past year, we are working hard to get patients in for the surgeries they need.
