It is important to be aware of drug\u2014drug and drug-supplement interactions with these patients. When treating these patients for acute and chronic illnesses beyond their T2D diagnosis, clinicians should inquire about any dietary supplements and medications they may be taking. It is alarming that fewer than 40% of patients reveal their use of dietary supplements to their health care provider, when an estimated 20% to 30% of people on prescription medicine take some form of botanical supplement.1For that reason, a complete drug and supplement inventory must be part of the patient intake process at each visit. Most clinicians use electronic medical software that will alert when such interactions are present. However, although this software helps to monitor for interactions, it can be fallible. It is important that clinicians be aware of some of the most common interactions with T2D medications and not rely solely on electronic software to flag such interactions. The majority of patients with T2D are on some form of oral antidiabetic agent. Patients are most commonly prescribed biguanides (eg, metformin), followed by glipizide) and meglitinides (eg, repaglinide). Other newer canaglifl ozin), and thiazolidinediones.2,3In addition to these agents, many patients with T2D are also on insulin therapy. The most common co-morbidities in patients with T2D are hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and hypertension.2Current recommendations for standards of care of T2D include a daily aspirin (if not contraindicated), an antihypertensive agent (if needed), and a cholesterol-controlling agent (if needed).2It is important to note that even these baseline T2D treatment medications can have drug\u2014drug interactions. Medications that interact with antidiabetes drugs include, but are not limited to, the following categories: cardiac medications, decongestants, antibiotics, thiazides, steroids, thyroid drugs, estrogens, oral contraceptives, testosterone, seizure medications, psychiatric medications, and cholesterol medications.4Example interactions are listed in Table 1.5In addition to drugs, dietary supplements can also interact with antidiabetic medications. It is preferred that medicines be taken a few hours apart from any supplements, which could help decrease interactions.6 Table 1: Drug-Antidiabetes Drug Interactions3 Drug Antidiabetes Metoprolol succinate (beta blocker) Canagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor) May alter glucose metabolism and prolong hypoglycemia and/or mask a hypoglycemic episode Hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic) Exenatide (GLP-1 Acarbose (alpha glucosidase (sulfonylurea) May increase of effects selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.*Please note: This is not a complete list. A healthy diet containing fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, and unsaturated fat is recommended for all patients with diabetes. However, maintaining this \"perfect\" diet on a daily basis can be a challenge. Dietary supplementation may compensate for some nutrient deficiencies, especially in a typical Western diet,7although, irrational or extreme consumption of these preparations can pose a risk to patients.7It is imperative that clinicians educate themselves on supplements that their patients may be taking. Most programs of study for Western-educated medical providers do not cover dietary supplementation in detail. This means that clinicians need to obtain additional information about dietary supplements and utilize key members of the health care team such as registered dieticians and certified nutritionists, for consult on dietary supplements. Additionally, it is important to note that supplements are regulated by the FDA in a different way than OTC and prescription drugs. For example, the FDA can regulate claims or terms on labels such as \"high potentcy.\"6There are, however, reputable resources to reference when researching supplements and supplement brands. For example, the letters \"USP\" on a supplement label show the supplement has met voluntary standards set by the US Pharmacopeial Convention (www.usp.org) and that they dissolve in lab testing designed to mimic human gut absorption.6Other reputable sources for information on supplements are the Council for Responsible Nutrition (www.crnusa.org), NSF International (www.nsf.org), and Consumer Lab (www.consumerlab.com). Examples of supplement interactions are included in Table 2.5 Table 2: Supplements and Anti-Diabetes Drug Interactions Supplement Anti-Diabetes Drug Possible Interaction Niacin (vitamin B3) Canagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor) May cause hyperglycemia St. John's Wort Repaglinide, nateglinide (meglitinides) May decrease meglitinide citrate hyponatremia, SIADH, and seizures Ginger All antidiabetic medications May increase risk of hypoglycemia SGLT2 = sodium glucose cotransporter 2; SIADH = syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.*Please note: This is not a complete list. These examples are just the tip of the iceberg as far as the vast amount of drug\u2014drug and drug-supplement interactions with antidiabetic drugs. Clinicians must always be mindful of these interactions and the importance of inquiring about any dietary supplements and medications patients with T2D may be taking. A more comprehensive list of drug-drug and drug-supplement interactions is available in Table 3. Table 3: Examples of Common Diabetes Drug\u2014Drug and Drug-Supplement Interactions3 Diabetic Class/Drug Interacting Drug/Supplement Type of Interaction All antidiabetic drugs Thiazide diuretics Combo may increase medication or insulin requirement; thiazides can cause hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose. Fish oil, krill oil (especially large doses) Combo may decrease hypoglycemic agency efficacy; fish oils may cause hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose. Ephedra, pseudoephedrine Combo may decrease hypoglycemic agent efficacy; sympathomimetic may cause hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose. Testosterone May increase risk of hypoglycemia (additive effects). Monitor glucose. Yohimbe Combo may increase risk of hypoglycemia (mechanism unknown; yohimbe has MAOI activity). Caution advised. Monitor glucose. Estrogens Combo may decrease hypoglycemic agent efficacy, cause hyperglycemia (antagonistic effects). Monitor glucose. Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) Combo may alter glucose metabolism, prolong hypoglycemia, or mask hypoglycemia symptoms. Monitor glucose. Flax seed Combo may increase risk of hypoglycemia, alter glycemic control (additive effects). Monitor glucose. Ginger (especially with large doses) Combo may increase risk of hypoglycemia, alter glycemic control (additive effects). Monitor glucose. Gingko Ginkgo may interfere with glycemic control by altering insulin secretion/metabolism. Monitor glucose. Ginseng (American, Asian, or Siberian) May enhance glucose-lowering effects, increase risk of hypoglycemia. Monitor glucose. Niacin Combo may decrease hypoglycemic agent efficacy; niacin may cause hyperglycemia (antagonistic effects). Monitor glucose. Chromium picolinate Combo may increase risk of hypoglycemia (synergistic effect). Monitor glucose. Glucosamine Combo may decrease hypoglycemic agent efficacy (glucosamine may increase insulin resistance and/or decrease insulin production). Monitor glucose.

(eg, glipizide) SSRIs Combo SSRI and sulfonylurea may risk of SIADH, hyponatremia, other adverse side effects. Fluconazole Combo may increase sulfonylurea levels, risk of hypoglycemia (hepatic metabolism can be inhibited). Monitor glucose.
