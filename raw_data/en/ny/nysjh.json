Essential oils have shown various pharmacological activities, such as antiviral activity, and therefore are proposed to have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. Due to their lipophilicity, essential oils can easily penetrate the viral membrane and cause the viral membrane to rupture. In addition, crude essential oils usually have many active constituents that can act on different parts of the virus including its cell entry, translation, transcription, and assembly. They have further beneficial pharmacological effects on the host's respiratory system, including anti-inflammatory, immune regulation, bronchiectasis, and mucolytics. This review reported potential essential oils which could be promising drugs for COVID-19 eradication. Essential oils have many advantages because they are promising volatile antiviral molecules, making them potential drug targets for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, whether used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. The aim of the current review is to shed light on the potential essential oils against enveloped viruses and their proposed activity against SARS-CoV-2 which is also an enveloped virus. The objectives were to present all data reflecting the promising activities of diverse essential oils against enveloped viruses and how they could contribute to the eradication of COVID disease, especially in indoor places. The data collected for the current review were obtained through the SciFinder database, Google scholar, PubMed, and Mendeley database. The data of the current review focused on the most common essential oils which are available in the pharmaceutical market and showed noticeable activities against enveloped viruses such as HSV and influenza.
