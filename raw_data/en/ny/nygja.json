OCHA's mission is to provide the opportunity for all Nevadans to access information regarding patient rights and responsibilities, and to advocate for and educate consumers and injured workers concerning t heir rights and responsibilities under various health care plans and policies. This education and advocacy is provided to those who have insurance through an employer, managed care, individual health policies, ERISA, Worker's Compensation, Medicare, or Med icaid. Assistance is also provided to the uninsured and underinsured. OCHA collaborates routinely with state and federal agencies, and non -profit organizations. OCHA has expanded operations since its inception, and as of July 2011, has been operating throu gh the Director's Office of DHHS. OCHA serves as an umbrella agency for multiple consumer health related programs, including: Bureau for Hospital Patients External Review Organization Small Business Insurance Education Program RxHelp4NV Canadian Prescrip tions Worker's Compensation Consumer Assistance Office of Minority Health Nevada 2 -1-1 Affordable Care Act - Consumer Assistance Program Affordable Care Act - Silver State Exchange Consumer Assistance Service Area: OCHA serves consumers statewide out of our main office in Las Vegas, and one satellite operation in Elko, Nevada to provide additional support to Northern/Rural Nevadans. The Office of Minority Health is also based in the Las Vegas Office for Consumer Health Assistance. Hours: OCHA office hour s are 8am - 5pm Monday through Friday, inquiries are accepted after hours by voicemail and email, and are returned as soon as possible. Workload History: OCHA currently has six full -time Ombudsmen managing caseloads of 125 to 240. OCHA has continued to receive a significant volume of calls related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and now has three temporary full -time Navigators funded by a grant from the Nevada Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, to assist consumers with applying for insurance covera ge. OCHA also continues to respond to an increased number of cases related to Medicaid. In addition to managing cases ranging in context from access to care, billing disputes, hospital bills, provider/insurance grievances and appeals, OCHA has increased i ts level of knowledge to resolve ACA -related cases by having staff members become Certified Application Counselors who are registered with the Nevada Division of Insurance, and can assist consumers with selecting a Qualified Health Plan or apply for Medica id. Comments: Full details of OCHA's programs, notable accomplishments, and history is published annually in our 2013 Executive Report, which is available on our 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 2011 2012 2013 2014INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS COMPLAINTS: case opened and investigated INQUIRIES: information, education, referral information given at time of inquiryNevada Department of Health and Human Services, Director's Office DHHS Fact Book, February 2016 Page 3 1.03 Office of Minority Health Program: The Office of Minority Health (OMH) was established under NRS 232.467. The mission of OMH is to improve the quality of health care services for members of minority groups, to increase access to health care services, to seek ways to provide education, address, treat and prevent diseases and conditions that are prevalent among mino rity populations, increase access to health care services, and disseminate information to and educate the public on matters concerning health care issues of interest to members of minority groups. AB519 placed the Office of Minority Health under the Office of Consumer Health Assistance within the Department of Health and Human Services, Director's Office. AB519 was approved by the Governor in June 2011. OMH provides a central source of information concerning healthcare services and issues for racial and ethnic minorities. The current focus of OMH is providing Education and Outreach about the Affordable Care Act to minority communities within Nevada, and encouraging individuals and families to enroll in Nevada Health Link or Nevada Medicaid. OMH endeavors to engage in outreach activities and fosters partnerships with stakeholder groups including: community and faith- based organizations; schools and universities; medical centers, health care systems, and health departments; tribal, state, and federal governmen t offices; policymakers and community residents; advisory committees and task forces; and corporations, foundations, and the media. OMH continues to provide information regarding minority health care issues and helps ensure that both public and private ent ities have access to culturally competent and linguistically appropriate health information. Funding: As of August 31, 2015, Nevada's State Partnership Grant Program to Improve Minority Health funding through the federal Office of Minority Health ended. T he Nevada OMH did apply for two additionally grant opportunities; however, was not selected as one of the few funded agencies nationwide, as there were only 17 funded states, as opposed to the 42, which had been funded in previous grant cycles. Due to the lack of funding, the Nevada OMH currently has no staff dedicated solely to its activities; however, OCHA administrative staff continues to seek other funding opportunities, while remaining engaged with community partners and statewide minority health coali tions.

Reports of child maltreatment that meet the statutory threshold for a home visit to determine child well -being, where there is not an imminent threat to the child's safety, may be referred to the Differ ential Response staff for assessment and case management. Typically these reports involve such issues as educational neglect, environmental neglect, medical neglect, and improper supervision. Frequently the Differential Response worker is able to assist the family in accessing services that will assist the family in providing positive interactions and a safe environment for their children. Service Areas: Service Areas: Services are provided in the following counties: Clark, Washoe, Elko, Carson City, Dougl as, Storey, Churchill, Lyon, Mineral, Pershing and southern Nye.

Re ports screened for a DR response typically involved families with basic needs, followed by educational neglect, lack of supervision, medical neglect, and various family problems. Currently, DR referrals reflect approximately 9 percent of the child maltreat ment reports in the communities served. If expanded statewide, it is estimated that DR referrals could reach 17 percent of total child maltreatment reports. Nevada is one of 22 states implementing Differential Response. DR program Administration is moving from DHHS Grants Management Unit to DHHS DCFS (Division of Child and Family Services) January 1, 2016. 74 296 765 977 1,093 1,187 1,306 Department of Health and Human Services, Director's Office DHHS Fact Book, February 2016 Page 5 1.05 Grants Management Unit Program: The Grants Management Unit (GMU) is an administrative unit within the Department of Health and Human Services, Director's Office, which administers grants to local, regional, and statewide programs serving Nevadans. The Unit ensures accountability and provides technical assistance for the following programs. Children's Trust Fund (CTF) grants prevent child abuse and neglect. Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) promotes self -sufficiency, family stability, and community revitalization. Family Resource Centers (FRC) provide info rmation and referral services, and various support services to families. Differential Response (DR) addresses child safety through partnerships between child welfare agencies and designated FRCs. Fund for a Healthy Nevada (FHN) grants (1) improve t he health and well -being of Nevada residents including programs that improve health services for children and (2) improve the health and well -being of persons with disabilities. Social Service Block Grant (SSBG -TXX) assists persons in achieving or main taining self -sufficiency and/or prevents or remedies neglect, abuse, or exploitation of children and adults. Revolving Account for Problem Gambling Treatment and Prevention provides funding for problem gambling treatment, prevention, research and relat ed services. The Contingency Account for Victims of Human Trafficking was created by the 2013 Legislature and revised by the 2015 Legislature. Funding may be awarded in a competitive grant process or through an emergency fund to provide direct victim a ssistance in crisis situations. No funds have been utilized to date. Eligibility: Most GMU funding sources target at -risk populations. CTF focuses on primary and secondary prevention of child abuse and neglect . CSBG targets people at 125 percent of the Fe deral Poverty Level. FRC must conduct outreach to at -risk populations. Some FHN funds are targeted to people with disabilities. Comments: Food Security: In FY13, a statewide community needs assessment indicated a need to shift resources to a new servic e category -- Food Security. Projects are intended to provide direct services to reduce hunger, help food insecure individuals and families become more self -sufficient, build capacity within the food safety network, and maximize federal benefits. Funding i s drawn primarily from FHN Wellness wit h a small assist from SSBG -TXX. Information and Referral (I&R): The same needs assessment indicated a need for stable support and development of information and referral (I&R). In FY14, the GMU began supporting Nevada 2-1-1 from a single source rather than piecing together small grants that were then reported across multiple funding streams. Health: In FY16, the amount allocated from FHN Wellness to health projects declined significantly to avoid duplication of benefit s available as a result of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid Expansion.

It e xpanded the role of states in fostering a technical infrastructure to facilitate intra -state, interstate and nationwide health information exchange (HIE). Better health care does not come from the adoption of technology itself. It is accomplished through the electronic exchange and use of health information for effective clinical decisions at the time and point of care. Health Information Technology (HIT) was responsible for administering the 4 -yr. $6,133,426 Nevada ARRA HITECH State HIE Cooperative Agreement awarded to DHHS, of which approximate ly $4.2 million was actually expended. The funding was used to facilitate creating the core infrastructure and capacity enabling the electronic exchange of health information and coordinating related HIE initiatives, including state economic and workforce development. The State HIE Cooperative Agreement performance period was February 8, 2010 through February 7, 2014. Other : As required by the grant, Nevada's State HIT Strategic and Operational Plan (State Health IT Plan) was approved by federal HHS in Ma y 2011, and the most recent required updated version was approved October 2013. The plan's implementation was enabled and supported by NRS 439.581 through 439.595 (Senate Bill 43 passed in 2011). Comments : In September 2009, Governor Jim Gibbons issued a n Executive Order establishing the Nevada Health IT Blue Ribbon Task Force (HIT Task Force), to assist DHHS with the development of the State HIT Plan and to recommend legislative and policy actions. From October 2009 through January 2011, the HIT Task For ce met almost monthly, under Open Meeting Law, and its final recommendations were incorporated into both the State Health IT Plan and SB 43 . By Executive Order, the HIT Task Force sunset on June 30, 2011, after successfully completing its mission. Per NRS 439.588, the Nevada Health Information Exchange (NV -HIE) was established September 2012 as a Nevada domestic non -profit corporation. Due to an unclear path for financial sustainability and the existence of a competing HIE in the marketplace, the NV -HIE Boa rd voted on January 24, 2014 to cease operations on February 7, 2014. On January 31, 2014, the NV- HIE Board voted to dissolve the corporation, which was done by the Nevada Secretary of State on February 28, 2014. At the end of the grant, Nevada was recogni zed by federal HHS for having the 2nd highest number of medical laboratory participants out of all 56 State and territory HIE grantees, and was commended for having 97% of its pharmacies enabled for and actively using e -Prescribing. Also, Nevada took a leadership role in interstate HIE, as a core member of the successful Westerns States Consortium federal grant project, and was a founding member of the National Association for Trusted Exchange (NATE), a non- profit organization made up of state HIE officials seeking to advance interstate HIE through state policy coordination. Currently: Health Information Technology advancement is underway throughout the Department of Health and Human Services.

While Q4 and Q1 numbers often decrease due to \"snowbirds\" heading north for the warmer months, this Q4 dip is greater due to a \"senior center boycott\" at the City of Henderson over an increase in suggested donation price.

In the North, November an d December 2014 census counts were lower due to staff shortages. 2. In the South, the decline in Residential Treatment Services since FY08 is due to the following reasons: As of the December 2015 update, DCFS has closed approximately six agencies with two more pending in the last two years. There had been a net decrease of approximately 50 HLOC (Higher Level of Care) beds over the last two years; the implementation of AB348 greatly increased the standards required for HLOC agencies. Many agencies have been unable to meet the requirements and were forced to close. Others voluntarily closed when their parent companies left Nevada. This led to the following: a. A decrease in the number of agencies providing services. b. Agencies accepting sibling grou ps to fill their beds instead of specialized placements. Agencies universally prefer higher -functioning sibling groups that pay nearly the same as the HLOC rate. c. A change in Medicaid approval of Basic Skills Training / Psychosocial Rehabilitative (BS T/PSR) services. The statewide Specialized Foster Care Pilot may have impacted the decrease as well.

Comment: Recent trends in caseload growth are due to the expansion of Me dicaid enrollment brought on by the implementation of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). All of the significant changes in caseload prior to the implementation of the PPACA, including the FY 2007 \"dip\", arose for macroeconomic reasons . There were no material explanatory changes in other areas (e.g., eligibility criteria or take -up rate) during the period. The principal causal factors are (1) population/demographic change, (2) secular trends in returns -to-skills, (3) the cyclic variatio n in the overall economy, (4) the cyclic variation in the labor market and (5) the complex lags associated with the aforementioned cycles and caseloads for means -tested social programs.

With the slow but steady economic gains of SFY13 continuing to carry forward into the first quarter of SFY14, the recent rise in the NEON caseload is not following its historical correlation to the state's economy. This rise in the caseload is theorized to be a result of the recent implementation of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion and new streamlined eligibility process. New Medicaid applicants are becoming aware of their eligibility for TANF and efficient application business processes are removing barriers and improving program access. If correct, it is anticipated that caseload growth will stabilize by the end of the fiscal year and caseload trends will return to their historical correlation with the economy.

A first screen is collected ideally between 24 and 48 hours of age, and the second screen is ideally collected between the 10th and 15th day of life. As of July 1, 2014, the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, in conjunct ion with the University of Nevada -Reno (UNR) School of Community Health Sciences, is responsible for testing and following Nevada's newborn babies' blood samples shortly after birth and again at two weeks of age, to screen for approximately 46 disorders each year. The Nevada State Public Health Laboratory is contracted to screen specimens, follow -up on positive screens and provide medical consultants who provide guidance to Nevada's primary care physicians until a confirmation of a diagnosis is reached. Families of infants with identified disorders can access follow -up services through Nevada Early Intervention Services or other community providers. The Newborn Screening Program is funded entirely with birth registration fees. Eligibility: There are no eligibility requirements for dried blood screening. Newborn screens are required for all infants born in Nevada. Birthing facility staff are required to collect an acceptable sample before the infant is discharged from the facility and to submit the sam ple for metabolic screening as required in NAC 442.020- 050.

The negative effects of hearing loss can be substantially mitigated through early intervention that may include amplification, speech therapy, cochlear implants, and/or signing. EHDI works with bir thing hospitals statewide, pediatric audiologists and with Nevada Early Intervention Services to ensure infants are screened, identified, and enrolled into services within recommended time frames. The program partners with non -profits, hospitals, and audi ologists to develop and update best practices and provides parents with education, support, and trained mentors.

The Program collaborates with providers, schools, pharmacies, immunization coalition s and other stakeholders to improve immunization practices by enrolling providers into the State Program, ensuring compliance to all regulations, and by educating providers how to record vaccination data and monitor coverage rates in the state's immunizati on registry (NV WebIZ). Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) : Any provider licensed by the State of Nevada to prescribe and administer vaccines may enroll as a participant in the VFC Program, as long as they serve the eligible population(s). The Program pr ovides federally funded vaccines at no cost to these participants, who then administer them to eligible children. VFC -eligible children include those who are uninsured, Medicaid enrolled/eligible, or American Indian/Alaska Native; and, the family is also not charged for the cost of these vaccines. Additionally, children enrolled in the NV Check -Up insurance plan are provided state- funded vaccines through a contract with the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy. Nevada WebIZ: Any provider that admin isters vaccines and any organization with a need to verify immunizations may enroll as users of NV WebIZ. Vaccination data collected in the system can be used to identify populations at risk in the event of a disease outbreak and to locate communities with low coverage to target interventions. On July 1, 2009 NRS 439.265 (and corresponding regulations) went into effect, requiring all persons vaccinating children in Nevada to enter certain data about the vaccination event. On January 28, 2010 the NRS corresp onding regulation was updated requiring all persons vaccinating adults in Nevada to also record specific information. The IIS operates as an \"opt -out\" system.

Program: Leaders from government agencies, non -profit organizatio ns and the private sector have joined forces to establish a strategic plan to increase food security in Nevada using the following core principles: Incorporate economic development opportunities into food security solutions. Use a comprehensive, coordi nated approach to ending hunger and promoting health and nutrition, rather than just providing emergency short -term assistance. Focus on strategic partnerships among all levels of government, communities, non -profit organizations, including foundations, private industries, universities, and research institutions. Use available resources in a more effective and efficient way. Implement research -based strategies to achieve measurable results. Agency Key Accomplishments: DHHS Director's Office In 2015 established the Office of Food Security in the Department of Health and Human Services Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Section. Governor's Office In 2014 established the Statewide Food Policy Advisory Council that links to and leverages regional and local community -based efforts. Governor's Council Researched and developed a menu of model policies/regulation options to promote food security in Nevada. Including breakfast after the bell programs and accountability reports for public s chools. NV Department of Agriculture In cooperation with a stakeholder group, drafted the Nevada School Wellness Policy to reflect current Federal School Wellness Policy Regulations. NV Department of Agriculture In cooperation with a stakeholder grou p, conducted a comprehensive benefit analysis study of the current state and nonprofit commodity/food delivery system that includes cost efficiency, frequency of delivery, and recommendations. NV Department of Agriculture In cooperation with a stakehold er group, developed a comprehensive community food supply assessment to determine what organizations, agencies and groups are providing services as well as the frequency and schedule of deliveries to determine efficiencies and opportunities for streamlinin g food distribution processes.

This recommendation is based on evidence that shows thes e programs increase the number of children who receive sealants at school, and that dental sealants result in a large reduction in tooth decay among school - aged children (5 to 16 years of age). Dental (pit and fissure) sealants are clear or opaque plastic resinous materials applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth to prevent dental caries (tooth decay). School - based dental sealant delivery programs provide dental sealants to students either onsite at schools or offsite in dental clinics. These pro grams often target schools in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods, often identified based on the percentage of children eligible for the federal free or reduced -price meal programs. Community Health Alliance sealant program is a non -profit school -based sealant program that utilizes a mobile van to provide oral health education, sealants and fluoride varnish to 2nd grade children in underserved schools in Nevada (>50 percent Free and Reduced Lunch [FRL]). They operate during the 9 - month academic yea r. Seal Nevada South is a non -profit school -based sealant program, administered through UNLV School of Dental Medicine (SDM). The program serves uninsured children in second through fifth grade in underserved schools (>50 percent FRL) in Southern Nevada. T hey operate during the 9 -month academic year. Future Smiles is a non -profit school -based sealant program that provides two types of delivery models: Set locations in School -Based Health Centers for Education and Prevention of Oral Disease (EPODs) and mobil e school -based locations utilizing portable equipment. Public Health Endorsed Dental Hygienists provide screenings, oral health education, dental cleanings, sealants, fluoride varnish and case management through a referral system to a local dentist or UNLV SDM. They operate 12 -months of the year. Eligibility: Eligibility is determined by the individual programs.

The Division of Public and Behavioral Health's HIV Prevention also provides funding for social marketing campaigns, HIV prevention information dissemination, and data collection. Eligibility: There are no eligibility requirements. It is our mandate to reduce HIV infections in Nevada, and this is accomplished by providing services to everyone. Some community based programs do require that participants meet criteria as outlined in the curriculum, i.e. target population or risk factors. Other: Please note that the HIV Prevention Program is funded on a calendar year basis and therefore, data and expenditures for this report are reported on the calendar year, not fiscal year. The increase in new HIV infections can be directly attributed to new targeted HIV testing strategies, targeting those most at -risk for acquiring HIV.

Reporting delays (an increase in reported cases will likely occur as time progresses), 2. Intra -state deduplication of reported HIV/AIDS cases (in December 2008, Nevada moved to a new HIV/AIDS database - eHARS - which has allowed the state and local jurisdictions to immed iately fix intra -state duplicate case reports), and 3.

It does not provide direct substance abuse prevention or treatment services. The Agency plans and coordinates statewide substance abuse service delivery and provides technical assistance to programs and other state agencies to ensure that resources are used in a manner which best serves the citizens of Nevada. Eligibility: All funded programs must not discriminate based on ability to pay, race/ethnicity, gender or disability. Additionally, programs are required to provide services utilizing a sliding fee scale that must meet minimum standards. Other: SAPTA is the designated Single State Agency for the purpose of applying for and expending the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SAPTBG) issued through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser vices Administration (SAMHSA). Data is accurate as of 7/21/2015, but some changes may occur until official closing.

Since 2014, the numbers of clients admitted to SAPTA programs and funded by SAPTA is declining as provider's transition to Medicaid and other third par ty payers. This primarily impacts outpatient services since these are the services typically reimbursed by Medicaid and the Managed Care Organizations. Residential numbers continue to decrease. In late 2014 and early 2015, two large residential provider s (Vitality and Bristlecone) reduced their beds to 16 thinking that would help them with attracting Medicaid reimbursement. That was not the case and Bristlecone plans to add 10 beds before the end of the calendar year, which will increase bed days provided in the future. Vitality has decided to stay at 16 beds per facility.

The frequency of inspections is determined by NRS, CMS's mission priority document, and by Division budget policy. Complaints investigations have trended downward for several quarters, and then appeared to leveled off and are now starting to show an increase. All complaints are triaged and assigned a priority based on the allegations; i nvestigations are then scheduled based on priority and availability of resources. HCQC has a backlog of lower priority complaints and due to the lack of investigation resources, some of these lower priority complaints are held for investigation during the next scheduled periodic visit at the facility.

Similar statutes and regulations addressing the public health threat posed by tuberculosis are found thr oughout the United States and its territories. Other: The State of Nevada's Tuberculosis (TB) Program continues to address its mission of \"reducing the incidence of TB by the aggressive management of newly diagnosed cases and extensive preventative treat ment of those infected with TB.\" In 2014, Nevada had 74 reported active cases of TB which is down from 92 cases in 2013. The prevention and control of TB in Nevada is also dependent upon (in part) meeting the challenges of controlling TB in the increasing number of foreign -born persons who come to the United States/Nevada infected with M. tuberculosis or who develop TB disease soon after arriving. In 2014, 50 of the 74 cases were foreign -born individuals. To assist with the prevention of active Tuberculosi s in the high -risk populations mentioned above, the State of Nevada TB Program will be performing several outreach activities in 2015.
