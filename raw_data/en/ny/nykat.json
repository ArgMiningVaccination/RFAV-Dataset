Some diseases that once injured or killed thousands of children have been eliminated completely and others are close to extinction - primarily due to safe and effective vaccines. One example of the great impact that vaccines can have is the elimination of polio in the United States. Polio was once America's most-feared disease, causing death and paralysis across the country, but today, thanks to vaccination, there are no reports of polio in the United States. Vaccines are only given to children after a long and careful review by scientists, doctors, and healthcare professionals. Vaccines will involve some discomfort and may cause pain, redness, or tenderness at the site of injection but this is minimal compared to the pain, discomfort, and trauma of the diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reactions, are very rare. The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children. Children in the U.S. still get vaccine-preventable diseases. In fact, we have seen resurgences of measles and whooping cough (pertussis) over the past few years. For example, preliminary data for 2012 show that more than 41,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in the United States. During this time, 18 deaths have been reported\u2014the majority of these deaths were in children younger than 3 months of age. Unfortunately, some babies are too young to be completely vaccinated and some people may not be able to receive certain vaccinations due to severe allergies, weakened immune systems from conditions like leukemia, or other reasons. To help keep them safe, it is important that you and your children who are able to get vaccinated are fully immunized. This not only protects your family but also helps prevent the spread of these diseases to your friends and loved ones. - A child with a vaccine-preventable disease can be denied attendance at schools or daycare facilities. Some vaccine-preventable diseases can result in prolonged disabilities and can take a financial toll because of lost time at work, medical bills, or long-term disability care. In contrast, getting vaccinated against these diseases is a good investment and is usually covered by insurance. The Vaccines for Children program is a federally funded program that provides vaccines at no cost to children from low-income families. To find out more about the VFC program, visit [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html)or ask your child's health care professional. Vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago. For example, the smallpox vaccination eradicated that disease worldwide. Your children don't have to get smallpox shots anymore because the disease no longer exists. By vaccinating children against rubella (German measles), the risk that pregnant women will pass this virus on to their fetus or newborn has been dramatically decreased, and birth defects associated with that virus no longer are seen in the United States. If we continue vaccinating now and vaccinating completely, parents in the future may be able to trust that some diseases of today will no longer be around to harm their children in the future. You can get even more information about the importance of infant immunization from the CDC: Vaccinating your children according to the recommended schedule is one of the best ways you can protect them from 14 harmful and potentially deadly diseases before their second birthday. Children who don't receive recommended vaccines are at risk of, one - getting the disease or illness. And two - having a severe case of the disease or illness. You can't predict or know in advance if an unvaccinated child will get a vaccine-preventable disease, nor can you predict or know how severe the illness will be or become. Vaccines don't just protect your child. Immunization is a shared responsibility. Families, healthcare professionals, and public health officials must work together to help protect the entire community - especially babies who are too young to be vaccinated themselves. Most parents are vaccinating their children. Estimates from a CDC nationally representative childhood vaccine communications poll (April 2012 online poll) suggest that most people are vaccinating according to schedule. In fact, 88.3% of parents reported that they are vaccinating according to schedule or are intending to do so. Most young parents in the U.S. have never seen the devastating effects that diseases like polio, measles, or whooping cough (pertussis) can have on a family or community. It's easy to think of these as diseases of the past. But the truth is they still exist. Diseases like measles and rubella are only a plane ride away. Measles epidemics are occurring in Great Britain, and rubella cases have skyrocketed in Japan. Large outbreaks of pertussis (whooping cough) have occurred in parts of the U.S. over the past few years. - Following the recommended schedule protects as many children as possible before they are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. - Depending on the vaccine, more than one dose is needed to build high enough immunity to prevent disease, boost immunity that fades over time, help to make sure people who did not get immunity from a first dose are protected or protect against germs that change over time, such as the flu. - Every dose of a vaccine is important because they all protect against infectious diseases that are a threat today. These diseases can be especially serious for infants and very young children. - Children do not receive any known benefits from following schedules that delay vaccines. We do know that delaying vaccines puts children at known risk of becoming ill with vaccine-preventable diseases. - Check the CDC's [childhood immunization schedule for all recommended vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf). - Missed a shot? Check the CDC's [vaccine catch-up scheduler](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html)- for parents, caregivers, and health care professionals. - Get answers from a Mayo Clinic physician about [why infants need so many vaccines so quickly](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/vaccination-schedule/faq-20058197). Parents agree that feeding and sleep schedules are important to help keep their children healthy. The same goes for childhood immunizations. Vaccinating children on time is the best way to protect them against 14 serious and potentially deadly diseases before their second birthday. \"The recommended immunization schedule is designed to offer protection early in life,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, Assistant Surgeon General and Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"when babies are vulnerable and before it's likely they will be exposed to diseases.\" Public health and medical experts base their vaccine recommendations on many factors. They study information about diseases and vaccines very carefully to decide which vaccines kids should get and when they should get them for the best protection. Although the number of vaccines a child needs in the first two years may seem like a lot, doctors know a great deal about the human immune system, and they know that a healthy baby's immune system can handle getting all vaccines when they are recommended. Dr. Schuchat cautions against parents delaying vaccination. \"There is no known benefit to delaying vaccination. In fact, it puts babies at risk of getting sick because they are left vulnerable to catch serious diseases during the time they are not protected by vaccines.\" When parents choose not to vaccinate or to follow a delayed schedule, children are left unprotected against diseases that still circulate in this country, like measles and whooping cough. Parents who are concerned about the number of shots given at one time can reduce the number given at a visit by using the flexibility built into the recommended immunization schedule. For example, the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine can be given at 6 through 18 months of age. Parents can work with their child's health care professional to have their child get this dose at any time during that age range. If you have questions about the childhood immunization schedule, talk with your child's doctor or nurse. The CDC has more [information about vaccines for children of all ages](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents). Healthcare professionals are parents' most trusted source of information about vaccines for their children. They play a critical role in supporting parents in understanding and choosing vaccines. Parents are encouraged to talk to their healthcare professionals about their vaccine-related questions and concerns. The CDC's [vaccine website for parents](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/index.html) has additional information about reasons to vaccinate, diseases vaccinations prevent, vaccine schedules, and what to expect at the appointment. Families who need help paying for childhood vaccines should ask their healthcare provider about the Vaccines for Children program, which provides vaccines at no cost to eligible children who do not otherwise have access to immunization. Whooping Cough Is Deadly for Babies Whooping cough can be serious for anyone, but it is life-threatening in newborns and young babies. The younger the baby is when he gets whooping cough, the more likely he will need to be treated in a hospital. Priority: Preventing Infant Deaths through Vaccination There are currently no whooping cough vaccines licensed or recommended for newborns at birth. For this reason, three vaccination strategies are used in combination with each other to provide the best protection possible to newborns and young babies: - Vaccinate pregnant women in their third trimester to give their newborns short-term immunity. - Vaccinate family members and caregivers before they meet the baby. - Vaccinate babies on time, beginning at 2 months of age, so they build their own immunity. Every Pregnancy Vaccination Recommendation CDC recommends that pregnant women receive the whooping cough vaccine called Tdap during each pregnancy. By doing so, the mother's body creates protective antibodies and passes some of them to her baby before birth. These antibodies give babies some short-term protection against whooping cough until they can begin building their own immunity through childhood vaccinations. Antibody levels are highest about two weeks after getting the vaccine. The vaccine is recommended in the third trimester, preferably between the 27th and 36th week of pregnancy, so the mother gives her baby the most protection (antibodies). The amount of whooping cough antibodies in a person decreases over time. This is why women need a whooping cough vaccine during each pregnancy so high levels of protective antibodies are transferred to each baby. Learn more about [vaccinating against whooping cough.](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines.html) Childhood Vaccine Recommendation The whooping cough vaccine for children (2 months through 6 years) is called DTaP. Children need their whooping cough vaccine on time as it is the best way to prevent whooping cough during childhood. DTaP vaccines should be given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to build up high levels of protection. Booster shots are needed at 15 through 18 months and at 4 through 6 years to maintain that protection. Vaccine Safety and Side Effects Vaccines, including whooping cough vaccines, are held to the highest standards of safety. Experts have studied the whooping cough vaccine for adolescents and adults (Tdap), and they have concluded that it is very safe for pregnant women and their babies. Results from many clinical trials showed that DTaP vaccines are very safe for infants and children. CDC continually monitors whooping cough vaccine safety. While whooping cough vaccines (Tdap and DTaP) are safe, side effects can occur. The most common side effects are mild (redness, swelling, tenderness) and serious side effects are extremely rare. Vaccine Effectiveness Getting whooping cough or a whooping cough vaccine (as a child or an adult) does not provide lifetime protection. In general, DTaP vaccination is effective for 89 out of 100 children who receive it, and Tdap vaccination protects 65 out of 100 people who receive it. Protection from both whooping cough vaccines fades over time, but people who are vaccinated and get whooping cough later are typically protected against severe illness.

Even though you are keeping her safe from diseases, it's hard to see your child cry when she gets her shots. But you can take some steps before, during, and after a vaccine visit to ease the pain and stress of getting shots: - Read about the shots your child will get in advance. Bring your child's vaccine record to show the doctor. Pack a favorite toy, book, blanket, or other comfort item. For older children, be honest\u2014shots can pinch or sting, but not for long. Remind them that shots help keep them healthy. - Ask your child's doctor any questions you have about vaccines. You may even want to ask about cooling or numbing the area of your child's arm or leg before the shots. - Distract your child with a toy, a story, a song, or something interesting in the room. Make eye contact with your child and smile, talk softly, or sing. Hold your child tightly on your lap, if you can. Take deep breaths with an older child to help \"blow out\" the pain. - After the shot, hug, cuddle, and praise your child. For babies, swaddling, breastfeeding or a bottle may offer quick relief. Comfort and reassure older children if they cry. - \"Read the Vaccine Information Sheets from your doctor so you know what to expect after the shots,\" said Dr. Melinda Wharton, Deputy Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. - Some children have pain or swelling where a shot was given, a rash, or a fever. These reactions are usually mild and resolve on their own without needing treatment. If you notice redness, soreness, or swelling from the shot, place a clean, cool washcloth on the area. If your child runs a fever, try a cool sponge bath. You can also use a non-aspirin pain reliever if your doctor says it's OK. Some children eat less, sleep more, or act fussy for a day after they get shots. Make sure your child gets plenty to drink. If you're worried about anything, call your doctor.
