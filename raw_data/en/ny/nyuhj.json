Think: [working with crystals](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a26559820/healing-crystals/) and [burning sage](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a26632859/benefits-of-sage-smudging/), for example, along with one you may not have tried yet: palo santo. Palo santo, which translates literally to \"holy wood\" in Spanish, is the harvested wood from palo santo trees which are found primarily in South America and in some regions of Central America. They're part of the citrus family, with a relation to frankincense and myrrh, explains Dr. Amy Chadwick, a naturopath at [Four Moons Spa](https://fourmoonsspa.com/) in California. \"It has a woody scent with hints of pine, lemon, and mint.\" The olfactory delight, he adds, \"has a gentleness to both its smell and its effect on the energy of a room,\" where it's commonly burned in stick form. Which is what you'll see if you do a quick search of #palosanto on social: a ton of highly stylized images and videos of the smudge sticks burning. And the good news is that the social media star has a slew of purported benefits you can supposedly reap, as palo santo can also be found in [essential oil](https://www.oprahdaily.com/beauty/skin-makeup/a25655971/essential-oils-for-stress/), incense, or [brewed into a tea](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a26785615/health-benefits-of-hibiscus-tea/), although the wood itself is what's gained the most Insta-fame. But what exactly does palo santo allegedly do? \"Its healing, medicinal and spiritual traits and abilities have been known and used for thousands of years,\" says [Alyson Charles](https://www.alysoncharles.com/), a shaman, seer, and TV Host. \"It can help with inflammatory reactions such as headaches and stomachaches as well as reduce stress levels, but is perhaps best known and used for its spiritual and energy cleansing and clearing abilities.\" Here, we've broken down other suggested benefits of palo santo. Palo santo sticks can be used to clear negative energy in your home. Thanks to its high resin content, palo santo wood is believed to release its purifying properties when burned. \"In the Shamanic history of South America, palo santo is said to remove negativity and obstacles and attract good fortune,\" says Chadwick. To cleanse any space's energy, simply light a stick and then extinguish the flame, gently waving the stick in the air or waving your hand over the stick. White smoke will be emitted from the smoldering stick, which can disperse around you or your space. Smudging palo santo can create a cathartic ritual. Rituals are great for those who crave routine\u2014or at least a way to decompress. And the act of smudging, or the process of lighting the stick and allowing the smoke to be released into the room, can be helpful in that regard. \"It allows for a mindful and intentional release and shift in energy,\" suggests Charles. \"Having a ritual is also useful for shifting our unhelpful attachments to sticky thoughts or emotions.\" Some believe sniffing palo santo oil can relieve headaches. As a way to give yourself relief, Charles suggests mixing palo santo with a carrier oil and rubbing small amounts into the temples of your head. Or, you can put the oil into heated boiling water and breathe in the steam that emanates. Dr. Isaac Alexis, an internist in West Virginia, explains that sniffing the diffusion or smudging a stick itself will help \"release neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, while stimulating the release of endorphins and enkephalins, the body's natural pain killers.\" Palo santo oil is supposedly a bug repellent too. It has a complex chemical composition that's especially rich in limonene, which is also present in the peels of citrus fruits, says Chadwick. \"Limonene is part of the plant's defense against insects.\" Diffusing palo santo oil purportedly helps to ward off colds. That's because \"when its oils are added to hot water and then inhaled, palo santo oil can relieve congestion and throat pain as well as inflammation, all of which are present in both the cold and the flu,\" says Alexis. ...and it's said to alleviate stomachaches. That same compound responsible for palo santo's bug repellency is also helpful in treating stomach discomfort. \"The d-limonene helps to relieve bloating, nausea, and cramping,\" says Alexis, of the aromatic property of palo santo (that's also found in citrus peels and cannabis, by the way). Palo santo oil can be used to reduce stress levels, too. \"As an essential oil, palo santo oil is purifying of the air and the mind. It has antimicrobial properties, tends to be calming to the nervous system, can reduce feelings of anxiety, and may brighten the mood,\" says Chadwick, who suggests diffusing it to help energetically cleanse your space. FYI, palo santo incense is an easy-to-use way to experience the plant's scent. \"Palo santo is often sold as incense sticks or cones which are made from fine wood shavings, mixed with a natural glue, and dried,\" says Chadwick. \"These burn a little more easily than the sticks.\" However, it's important to do your research before picking up some self-described palo incense and read the packaging. \"Sometimes incense sticks are made using essential oil rather than the actual wood shavings and are rolled or soaked into the combustible substance on the stick,\" Chadwick warns. \"Companies vary in their combustible substances as well as the quality of oils used.\" Drinking palo santo tea might help with inflammation. Keep in mind there's no extensive research here, though, notes Chadwick, but that sipping on a decoction that's been simmered may help reduce body inflammation and pain. And like many other cups of tea do, the ritual of sipping palo santo tea can help calm an anxious mind. And, as mentioned, smudging can help energetically cleanse your home, too. Clearing a space can be a beautiful way to finish a deep house cleaning, transition after you've had company over, or before or after entertaining in our homes, between clients if we are doing healing work, or before starting a project. It can help set a creative intention and can be useful before beginning a meditation, or engaging in any intentional projects or work.
