The practice of holistic health is based on the idea that medical practitioners should not be only medicating the symptoms, but instead finding the root causes of a medical issue. Additionally, the physicians that practice holistic medicine are concerned with their patient's entire system, as opposed to focusing only on the part of the body that is causing their patient pain or that is directly associated with their illness. They recognize that there are multiple factors that contribute to health and disease, and addressing all of them yields superior results. Holistic medicine investigates how each part of the human body functions together and recognizes that if one part is out of balance, it can cause illness and disease. Since every part of the human body relies on a fully functioning system, holistic doctors take a big-picture approach to deciphering what the true cause of the sickness is. Balancing the body's functions is a large part of what holistic practices and naturopathic medicine doctors do, making use of a variety of treatment techniques that can help to address issues like chronic fatigue and more. Integrative medicine is a blend of traditional and holistic practices, with the emphasis on natural healing or non-invasive practices being applied whenever possible. The medical providers at an integrative clinic work closely with their patients to devise a plan for their overall health and wellness. Integrative doctors are supportive of the needs of their patients, and assess their lifestyle, mental health and overall well-being to formulate a treatment plan. Our practice embraces the philosophies of both holistic and integrative medicine, and our medical staff values the principles of putting the patient's health first. We treat chronic illnesses, pain, allergies, cancer treatment, and injuries to help our patients regain the enjoyment of their lives. It's important for us to listen to our patients and hear what they're saying\u2014 for example, an older male patient may require testosterone replacement therapy in order to fully address symptoms that might otherwise be passed off as depression and fatigue from other causes. In some medical practices, the medical diagnosis is made quickly with a series of prescription medications to follow. Our goal is to take sufficient time to solve the problem, so that the patient has options for treatment. We don't immediately reach for our prescription pads to temporarily stop the medical issues of our clients. Instead, we opt for naturopathic medicine whenever viable, and more conventional medications if they are the better option. Where prescription medication makes sense, we will continue to search for an alternative for the patient for the long term. We make it a point to educate our patients about their essential health functions and how to live a more fulfilling and healthy life. We encourage patients to ask questions, be involved in their health, and stay active every day. It's our mission to offer the support and guidance they need to maintain balance and happiness in their lives through holistic and integrative medicine. "}
