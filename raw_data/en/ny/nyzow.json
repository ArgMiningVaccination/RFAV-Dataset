McCullough, M.D., MPH for allegedly spreading COVID-19 misinformation under the Baylor name in media interviews.

In February, McCullough left his position as vice chief of internal medicine for cardiovascular disease at Baylor University Medical Center and agreed \"not to state that he is employed by or affiliated\" with the health system.

Bartlesville Examiner Enterprise, Oct 6, 2021] Fox News criticized for promoting false information about COVID-19 vaccination. A Media Matters analysis has concluded: Fox's efforts to undermine the coronavirus vaccines really kicked into gear following President Joe Biden's inauguration. According to a Media Matters analysis, in the 254 days since Biden took office (from January 20 through September 30), Fox undermined the vaccination efforts at least once on 238 of the days (94%). The network's efforts to undermine inoculations increased as we got further into Biden's presidency; from January 20 through March 31, Fox undermined the vaccine effort at least once on 80% of the days (57 out of 71), but from April 1 through September 30, the network undermined the vaccine efforts at least once on 99% of the days (181 out of 183). The two days from April through September when there wasn't an effort to undermine vaccinations came amid overwhelming coverage of the final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in late August and early September, when discussions of the vaccination efforts were put on the back burner. From March 27 to August 28, Fox undermined the vaccination each day for 155 straight days. [Monroe T, Savillo B.
