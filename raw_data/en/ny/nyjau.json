FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb laid out the rationale in stark terms. \"In recent years, we've seen a large uptick in products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed for a wide array of diseases and conditions, from the common cold to cancer,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"In many cases, people may be placing their trust and money in therapies that may bring little to no benefit in combating serious ailments, or worse\u2014that may cause significant and even irreparable harm because the products are poorly manufactured, or contain active ingredients that aren't adequately tested or disclosed to patients.\" [Click here](https://fortune.com/getbrainstormhealth/) to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations.
