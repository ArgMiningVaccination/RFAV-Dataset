Levy Economics Working Paper 22101 HOOVER INSTITUTION 434 GALVEZ MALL STANFORD UNIVERSITY STANFORD, CA 94305-6010 January 29, 2022 We quantify and study state-level economic policy uncertainty. Tapping digital archives for nearly 3,500 local newspapers, we construct three monthly indexes for each state: one that captures state and local sources of policy uncertainty (EPU-S), one that captures national and international sources (EPU-N), and a composite index that captures both. EPU-S rises around gubernatorial elections and own-state episodes like the California electricity crisis of 2000-01 and the Kansas tax experiment of 2012. EPU-N rises around presidential elections and in response to 9-11, Gulf Wars I and II, the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, the 2012 fiscal cliff episode, and federal government shutdowns. Close elections elevate policy uncertainty much more than the average election. The COVID-19 pandemic drove huge increases in policy uncertainty and unemployment, more so in states with stricter government-mandated lockdowns. VAR models fit to pre-COVID data imply that upward shocks to own-state EPU foreshadow weaker economic activity in the state.

High uncertainty can depress economic activity by causing rms to defer in- vestments that are costly to undo, by raising credit spreads and risk premiums (thereby dampening business investment and hiring), and by prompting consumers to postpone purchases of durable goods.1Several studies provide evidence that uncertainty increases around political elections and that election-related uncertainty has material effects on corporate investment, capital flows, pre- cautionary savings, and stock price volatility.2Baker et al. (2014) document an upward drift in U.S. policy uncertainty since the 1960s that broadly coincides with rising political polarization and growth in government spending, taxes, and regulations. Previous research focuses on national measures of policy uncertainty and national outcomes, as in Alexopoulos and Cohen (2015), Baker et al. (2016), Davis (2016), Ozturk and Sheng (2018), and Ahir et al. (2018). Uncertainty related to sub-national policy also matters for business and household decision-making. State and local governments differ greatly in the design of their tax systems and their choice of tax rates. Their spending amounts to almost 15 percent of U.S. GDP (Nunn et al., 2019). They also determine land-use policies, business and occupational licensing rules, education standards, minimum wages, unemployment benets, eligibility rules for social programs, environmental regulations, health and safety regulations, and more. Indeed, Justice Louis Brandeis famously characterized the states as 'laboratories of democracy.'3 Whether experimentation per se is the intent, the power to set policies and change them is a source of economic uncertainty. States also differ in industry mix, energy sources, population characteristics, and the economic footprint of the federal government. As a consequence, states are differently exposed to federal tax policy, defense spending, energy prices, and other economic 1See, for example, Bernanke (1983) and McDonald and Siegel (1986) on the value of waiting to invest when uncertainty is unusually high; Christiano et al. (2014), Gilchrist et al. (2014) and Arellano et al. (2019) on uncertainty effects that work through credit spreads and risk premiums; and Eberly (1994) on how uncertainty affects consumer expenditures on durable goods. Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde et al. (2015) show how scal policy uncertainty depresses output in a New Keynesian model by intensifying monopoly pricing distortions. Bloom (2014) reviews the larger literature. P\u00e1stor and Veronesi (2013) and Arbatli et al. (2022) consider the two-way interplay between policy uncertainty and economic performance. 2See Canes-Wrone and Park (2012), Julio and Yook (2012, 2016), Giavazzi and McMahon (2012), Kelly et al. (2016), Hassan et al. (2019) and Baker et al. (2020), among others. Many other studies investigate the economic effects of policy uncertainty more generally. See, for example, Baker et al. (2016) and Gulen and Ion (2016). 3New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262 (1932). 1developments influenced by federal policy.4As an example, national policy efforts to promote a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources have profoundly uneven effects across the fty states. As another example, hikes in the federal minimum wage may matter little in high-wage states while materially raising the cost of low-wage labor in other states. In light of these remarks, we utilize the digital archives of nearly 3,500 local newspapers to construct three monthly indexes of economic policy uncertainty for each state: one that captures state and local sources of policy uncertainty ( EPU -S), another that captures national and inter- national sources ( EPU -N), and a composite index ( EPU -C) that captures both state + local and national + international sources. Half the articles that feed into our composite indexes discuss state and local policy, conrming that sub-national matters are important sources of policy uncertainty. Our EPU measures exhibit enormous increases in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with evidence for a wide range of other uncertainty indicators in Altig et al. (2020). Looking over our full sample (which for a dozen states extends as far back as 1985), EPU -Srises around presidential and own-state gubernatorial elections and in response to own-state episodes such as the California electricity crisis of 2000-01 and the Kansas tax experiment of 2012. EPU -Nrises around presidential elections and in response to the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the July 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, federal government shutdowns, and other \"national\" events. Close elections (winning vote margin under 4 percent) elevate policy uncertainty much more than less competitive elections. Using statistical models that include controls for common trends, seasonal effects, and state-level economic conditions, a close presidential election contest raises EPU -Nby 60 percent and a close gubernatorial contest raises EPU -Sby 35 percent. More broadly, the relative importance of state and national sources of policy uncertainty differs greatly across states and over time. As a simple metric, consider the ratio of EPU -StoEPU -N for a given state. The time-averaged value of this ratio ranges from 0.35 in the District of Columbia to 1.51 in Alaska. The cross-state average value rose from 0.65 in the pre-pandemic years to 1.1 in the period from March 2020 to June 2021. Since the timing, stringency, and duration of gathering restrictions, school closure orders, business closure orders, and shelter-in-place orders during the pandemic were largely set by state and local authorities, it makes sense that EPU -S 4For evidence, see Davis et al. (1997), Albuoy (2009), and Nakamura and Steinsson (2014). Mumtaz et al. (2018) provide evidence that national uncertainty shocks have heterogeneous effects across the states. 2saw an especially large increase after February 2020.5 Our state-level measures make it feasible to leverage sub-national variation when studying policy uncertainty and its effects, while also controlling for local institutions and economic con- ditions.6To our knowledge, we provide the rst evidence on the relative importance of state and national sources of state-level policy uncertainty, how these sources differ across states, and how they vary over time within states. By exploiting the richness of state-level data, we strengthen the evidence that closer elections for political leaders bring more policy uncertainty. We also develop the rst evidence on how government-mandated lockdowns during the pandemic affected policy uncertainty. And we provide evidence that state-level policy uncertainty matters for state-level economic performance. Using V AR models that parallel ones widely applied in studies of national policy uncertainty, we nd that upward innovations in EPU -Cforeshadow higher own-state un- employment and lower employment. Similar patterns hold when we focus on upward innovations inEPU -NorEPU -S. Four other studies feature sub-national measures of policy uncertainty. Shoag and Veuger (2016) examine state-level indicators of policy uncertainty in the Great Recession. Their measures lack a time-series dimension. Rauh (2019) develops text-based uncertainty indicators for Cana- dian provinces and territories. In concurrent work, Elkamhi et al. (2021) also use newspapers to construct state-level EPU measures. We differ from their work in building indexes that separately quantify national and state sources of state-level policy uncertainty. Like Elkamhi et al. (2021), we nd a great deal of state-specic time variation in policy uncertainty. And like them, we nd that upward shocks in state-level EPU foreshadow weaker economic performance in the state. Their measures end in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge increases in policy uncer- tainty that came with it. Finally, Ash et al. (2020) consider state-level EPU - as measured by the frequency of \"economic policy uncertainty\" in local newspapers - to test one implication of their incomplete-contracts theory of legislative detail. The next section explains how we construct our state-level indexes and summarizes their be- havior over time. Section 3 explores several drivers of state-level EPU, with particular attention 5See Arnon et al. (2020), Coibion et al. (2020) and Goolsbee et al. (2020) on the prevalence of restrictive orders issued by state and local governments during the pandemic. 6Our data are freely available at www.policyuncertainty.com/state_epu.html. We update our state-level EPU mea- sures on a regular basis, following our customary practice for the national EPU measures featured on the same site. 3to election-related uncertainty and a variety of state, national, and international episodes that in- volve high levels of policy uncertainty. In Section 4, we use pre-COVID data to estimate panel V AR models that relate state-level economic activity to state-level EPU. We apply the models to characterize the dynamic response of state-level activity to EPU shocks, with special attention to California in view of its size, policy-induced electricity crisis in 2000-01, and gubernatorial recall in 2003. Section 5 focuses on developments during the pandemic. We nd that states with stricter lockdowns had bigger rises in policy uncertainty relative to 2019, bigger rises in unemployment, and bigger falls in employment - all conditional on pandemic severity, as measured by COVID deaths per capita. Section 6 offers concluding remarks. 2 State-level Economic Policy Uncertainty Indexes To measure state-level economic policy uncertainty (EPU), we turn to local newspapers in each state and track the fraction of articles that discuss policy-related economic uncertainty. We follow the approach of Baker et al. (2016) in constructing our measures but develop an extensive collection of new term sets to disentangle state and local from national (and international) sources of policy uncertainty. 2.1 Why Newspapers? Newspapers have many attractive attributes for our purposes. They publish frequently, facilitating the creation of monthly, weekly and even daily measures. Their timely character allows for the pro- duction of forward-looking uncertainty indicators in real time, which is especially valuable amidst novel developments like the COVID-19 pandemic (Altig et al., 2020). Digital newspaper archives often extend back for decades, letting us create panel data with a long time-series dimension. Newspaper coverage of a particular topic expands and contracts as concerns and news flow related to the topic wax and wane. Moreover, the richness of newspaper text lets us drill into the forces that drive uncertainty in response to particular state, national and international developments. By using multiple newspapers in a given state and month, we average out much of the idiosyncratic noise present in the coverage of a single newspaper, and we reduce biases that might arise from slanted coverage in particular papers. Finally, newspapers offer one of the few sources for cre- 4ating sub-national uncertainty measures on a frequent and timely basis. In contrast, uncertainty proxies based on option prices or nancial market volatility are difcult to create for sub-national units. And survey data typically lack the combination of spatial granularity, frequency, and topical density that is easily achieved with newspapers. 2.2 Tracking Newspapers To construct our EPU measures, we draw on the digital newspaper archives provided by the Access World News Newsbank service. We include daily and weekly newspapers, ranging from small, local papers to flagship newspapers that circulate throughout the state. We exclude papers with a strong national reach like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Our sample runs from January 1985 to the present, is shorter for many states, and covers all states from 2006 onward. All told, we use about 3,500 newspapers, and the median number of papers per state-month observation is 49. The average coverage duration for the newspapers in our sample is about 14 years. Once included, coverage usually extends through the present day, although about 250 papers disappear from the archives by 2010. Appendix Table A.1 provides additional statistics on newspaper counts, circulation, and sample start dates by state. 2.3 Using Term Sets to Flag Relevant Newspaper Articles We flag newspaper articles that contain at least one of 'economic' or 'economy' ( E); and 'uncertainties', or 'uncertainty' ( U); and at least one term in a policy set that differs between EPU -NandEPU -Sto reflect their different objectives. In devising the policy sets forEPU -NandEPU -S, we avoid terms like 'taxes' and 'tax policy' that refer to shared responsibilities among federal, state, and local governments.7 The policy term set for EPU -Nmainly contains terms for national policy-making institutions and regulatory agencies but also includes 'monetary policy' and terms that refer to the election of federal ofcials. See Table 1. For EPU -S, we tailor the policy sets to cover relevant state and 7We investigated whether the inclusion of tax-related terms improve our EPU -NandEPU -Sindexes. Not sur- prisingly, tax-related terms are unhelpful in distinguishing between articles about national sources of policy uncertainty and articles about state and local sources. Moreover, conditional on our other policy terms, the inclusion of tax-related terms flags few articles about policy uncertainty that we otherwise miss. On the margin, tax-related terms yield a low ratio of true positives to false positives in flagging articles. Baker et al. (2016) reached the same conclusion, based on a large-scale human audit study, regarding the potential use of tax-related terms in their national EPU index. 5local ofcials, policy-making bodies, and regulatory agencies. Thus, our state-specic include terms like 'governor', 'mayor', 'state senate', 'city council', and the like. To assemble these terms, we consulted government websites for the titles of ofcials and names of legislatures and state bodies with authority over regulations pertaining to the environment, labor and unem- ployment, gambling, transportation, energy and utilities, banking, and other nancial services. We include 'zoning' in our EPU -Spolicy sets, because zoning functions as an important policy lever that is exercised mainly by state and local governments. We also include 'referendum' for states that have provisions for putting direct votes on policy matters before their citizens. Table 1 reports our policy set for Michigan. The full collection of state-specic policy term sets is available at the Economic Policy Uncertainty website.8To facilitate comparison to earlier work, Table 1 also reports the \"BBD\" policy term set developed by Baker et al. (2016). 2.4 EPU Index Construction Having flagged a suitable set of articles, we compute the raw state-level indexes by calculating RawEPU -Ns;t=(# of Articles with E,Uand National Policy Terms)s;t (Total # of Articles in Same Newspapers)s;t(1) RawEPU -Ss;t=(# of Articles with E,Uand Own-State Policy Terms)s;t (Total # of Articles in Same Newspapers)s;t, and (2) RawEPU -Cs;t=(# of Articles with E,Uand (Own-State or National Policy Terms) )s;t (Total # of Articles in Same Newspapers)s;t, (3) wheresandtindex the state and monthly time period, respectively. To obtain our nal indexes, we divide each raw index value by the average of Raw EPU -N from 2006 to 2019 for the state in question and multiply by 100. This normalization preserves information about the relative magnitudes of EPU -N,EPU -SandEPU -Cwithin each state, which lets us study how state and local sources of policy uncertainty compare to national sources.9 8https://policyuncertainty.com/state_epu_terms.html 9Our normalization method equalizes the level of EPU -Ns;tacross states over the normalization period. We make this choice deliberately based on our sense that cross-state variation in average levels is heavily influenced by differences in newspaper practices across states, e.g., the share of newspaper articles devoted to sports or weather. 6We take the same approach in calculating the raw and normalized versions of our EPU -BBD measures for each state. 2.5 State-Level EPU Behavior over Time and Across States Figure 1 displays monthly values for the cross-state averages of EPU -NandEPU -S. Gulf Wars I and II, close presidential elections, nancial crises, major political conflicts over scal policy, the June 2016 Brexit referendum, trade policy tensions during the Trump presidency, and the im- peachment of President Trump in December 2019 all leave visible marks on the indexes, especially EPU -N. The pandemic pushed (average) EPU -Nto 2.7 times its pre-COVID peak and pushed EPU -Sto more than four times its previous peak. Even before the pandemic struck, policy uncertainty levels had drifted upward over time: The averageEPU -Nvalue is 114 from 2008 to 2019, as compared to 96 from 1985 to 2007. This pattern broadly aligns with the newspaper-based evidence in Baker et al. (2016), who also nd an upward drift in policy uncertainty measures derived from the periodic Beige Books compiled by economists in the Federal Reserve System and in the narrative discussions of \"Risk Factors\" in the annual 10-K lings of publicly listed corporations. It is also consistent with evidence on the political risks facing listed rms developed by Hassan et al. (2019) from the transcripts of their quarterly earnings conference calls. The times-series correlation between the two measures displayed in Figure 1 is 0.74 from 1985 to 2019 and 0.88 when including data through June 2021. Aside from the COVID episode, the cross-state average EPU -Nmeasure fluctuates with greater amplitude than average EPU -S, because many state-level sources of EPU are idiosyncratic and tend to average out in the cross section. However, as Figure 1 illustrates, common shocks can drive large jumps in state and local sources of EPU across many or all states. Figure 2 displays a quarterly series for the equal-weighted average value of EPU -Cand its three-way decomposition by source of policy uncertainty. Our decomposition reflects the content of articles the feed into the EPU -Cindexes - specically, whether they discuss only national (and international) policy matters, only state and local policy matters, or both. From 1985 to February 2020, articles that discuss only national policy matters account for 50% of the average EPU -C value. Articles that discuss only state and local policy matters account for 30%, and those that 7discuss both account for 20%. From March 2020 to June 2021, the corresponding shares are 38% for national only, 40% for state and local only, and 22% for articles that discuss both. The sources of EPU also vary greatly across states. At the extremes, articles that mention only state and local policy matters account for 45% of EPU -Cin Alaska from 1985 to 2021 but only 18% in South Dakota and 10% in Washington, DC. Articles that mention only national and international policy matters account for 75% of EPU -Cin Washington, DC and 62% in Pennsylvania but only 26% in Wyoming and Alaska. As we remarked above, the cross-state average values of EPU -NandEPU -Sare strongly correlated over time. There is, however, a great deal of state-specic time-series variation. Looking at contemporaneous between-state relationships in the monthly data, the average pairwise time- series correlation is 0.39 (0.55) for EPU -Nand 0.23 (0.59) for EPU -Sfor the period ending in 2019 (2021).10Looking within states over time in the pre-pandemic sample period, the correlation betweenEPU -NandEPU -Sranges from 0.17 to 0.76, with a mean of 0.45. In summary, there is much commonality in measured EPU fluctuations across states and over time within states, but there is also a great deal of separate variation. Separate variation is especially helpful in downstream econometric investigations of policy uncertainty drivers and consequences. 3 Drivers of State-Level Economic Policy Uncertainty 3.1 Election-Related Uncertainty Elections are an obvious source of policy uncertainty. Indeed, Baker et al. (2020) nd that national EPU indices exhibit a clear tendency to rise in the months leading up to national elections in a sample of 23 countries around the world. We now investigate whether and how our state-level EPU measures respond to U.S. presidential and own-state gubernatorial elections. In Table 2, we regress our monthly state-level EPU indexes on election indicators that equal one in an election month and the prior month, zero otherwise. Column (1) reports a least-squares 10Correlations between larger states tend to be higher, as do correlations between states with newspapers that have greater circulation. This pattern suggests that some of the variation in our state-level indexes reflects newspaper-level noise. Thus, we see some scope for improving our indexes by tapping a larger number of newspapers in smaller states, if and when digital archives for additional papers become available. 8regression of log EPU -Ns;ton these indicators.11We control for state xed effects and time- varying economic conditions, as measured by the state's contemporaneous unemployment rate and a summary measure of its coincident economic indicators. On average and conditional on the controls,EPU -Ns;tis 33 log points higher around presidential elections, with a t-statistic of 13. Gubernatorial elections also raise EPU -Ns;t, but the effect is much smaller and only marginally signicant. When we add common year effects (controlling for any drift over time in the under- lying level of EPU) and common month effects (controlling for unobserved seasonal forces that affect EPU in Novembers, for example), the coefcient on the presidential election indicator is nearly unchanged, but the gubernatorial election indicator becomes smaller and statistically in- signicant. We also nd strong statistical evidence that presidential and gubernatorial elections have sizable positive effects on EPU -Ss;tin columns (4) and (5). Notably, we nd substantially higher effects of gubernatorial elections on EPU -Ss;trelative toEPU -Ns;t. Close elections (winning margin less than 4 percent) yield especially large increases in our state-level policy uncertainty measures, as shown in columns (3) and (6). The total estimated effect of a close presidential election on EPU -Ns;tis 47 log points, or 60 percent. The total effect of a close, own-state gubernatorial election on EPU -Ss;tis 30 log points, or 35 percent. The results in Table 2 tell us that elections have powerful effects on state-level policy uncer- tainty, and that they alter the mix between EPU -NandEPU -Sover time. We isolate the mix effect in Figure 3, which plots the average time path of EPU -Srelative toEPU -Nin the months around presidential and gubernatorial elections, conditional on state-level economic conditions and other controls. Gubernatorial elections raise the ratio of EPU -Srelative toEPU -N, with a peak estimated effect of about 18 log points in the election month. Presidential elections pull down the ratio ofEPU -Srelative toEPU -N, with a peak estimated effect of about -31 log points. 3.2 Selected National and International Events We now investigate how our state-level EPU measures respond to several national and interna- tional events that created policy uncertainty directly or that raised profound questions about policy responses: the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon 11In practice, we use the inverse hyperbolic sine of the state-level EPU measures. The inverse hyperbolic sine transformation handles zero values while closely approximating the natural log transformation. See Bellemare and Wichman (2020). 9building on 11 September 2001; the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis in July 2011; the June 2016 Brexit ref- erendum in the United Kingdom, which reverberated through nancial markets around the world; Donald Trump's election victory in November 2016, the biggest U.S. presidential election surprise since Harry Truman defeated Thomas Dewey in the 1948 contest; and partial federal government shutdowns that commenced in October 2013 and December 2018. Figure 4 displays histograms of one-month log changes, ln( EPU -Ns;t\u000e EPU -Ns;t\u00001), where sindexes states as before, and tis the event month. All six events drove increases in EPU -Nin most states, and the increases are often quite large. For example, the November 2016 presidential election outcome triggered EPU -Nincreases in 86 percent of states, with a median jump of 80 log points. Four states (Georgia, Maryland, Maine, and Rhode Island) had EPU -Njumps of 200 log points or more in reaction to Trump's election win. The debt-ceiling crisis and the two government shutdowns drove EPU -Nincreases in 80 percent or more of states, and the 9-11 attack raised EPU -Nin all but three states. The median EPU -Nspike ranges from 45 to 120 log points across these four episodes. Lastly, in reaction to the surprise Brexit referendum outcome, EPU -Nrose in 84 percent of states, with a median jump of 64 log points. As the Brexit example illustrates, major policy developments in other countries can drive large, heterogeneous changes in state-level policy uncertainty. Figure 1 identies other foreign developments that drove large increases in EPU -N. 3.3 The California Electricity Crisis of 2000-01 California experienced a spectacular electricity crisis from May 2000 to June 2001 after a multi- year effort to reform its wholesale and retail markets.12Wholesale prices rose by a factor of six from the second half of 1999 to the second half of 2000. Average spot prices for wholesale power in the rst few months of 2001 were ten times their levels in 1998 and 1999. Regulators froze retail electricity prices in the summer of 2000, before letting them rise in early 2001. Even then, they let retail prices rise much less than wholesale power costs. By January 2001, California's two largest utilities were insolvent and had ceased paying their bills for wholesale power. Governor Gray Davis declared a state of emergency on January 17th, and the state began purchasing power directly at very high costs to head off widespread blackouts. Many Californians had already experienced 12Our summary of what was a multi-faceted and highly contentious regulatory, political, and economic crisis draws on Joskow (2001), Wolak (2003), and Bushnell (2004). See those sources for a fuller discussion of the crisis. 10rolling blackouts and mandatory cutbacks in electricity consumption. The electricity crisis was a principal factor in the ultimately successfully effort to recall Gov- ernor Davis. That effort began in early 2003 and gained momentum in May 2003, when U.S. Representative Darrell Issa announced he would contribute substantial sums to help gather signa- tures to force a recall election. By July 2003 the recall campaign had gathered enough signatures to put the question on the ballot. The recall election on October 7 removed Governor Davis and elected Arnold Schwarzenegger as his successor. This episode remains one of only two successful gubernatorial recall efforts in U.S. history, the other taking place in North Dakota in 1921. California's electricity crisis and gubernatorial recall are clearly visible in Figure 5, which plots the quarterly paths of EPU -SandEPU -Nfor the state from 1996 to 2006. Its EPU -Slevels during the electricity crisis and around the recall campaign and election are more than twice as high as in the preceding and following years. Its EPU -Sindex rose much more during this period than the average of EPU -Sindex values, as seen by comparing to Figure 1. EPU -Nalso rose to high levels from 2000 to 2004, largely because of national and international developments that affected all states. California-centric aspects of federal policy actions also contributed to the state's high EPU -Nvalues in this period. Specically, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) played a signicant role in California's electricity crisis.13 3.4 Other Illustrative Episodes with High State-Level EPU Figure 6 highlights selected episodes with high levels of EPU in three other states. The chart for Kansas shows that EPU -Smore than doubled in late 2010, when Sam Brownback prevailed in the state's gubernatorial election. He ran on a platform that stressed tax reform and, once elected, followed through. The 'Kansas Experiment' to reduce income taxes, enacted in 2012, and the passage of additional tax cuts in early 2013 are both clearly visible in the state's EPU -Sindex. 13FERC initiated a formal investigation into California's wholesale electricity markets in August 2000, identied \"structural reforms that must be addressed\" and placed a ceiling on electricity price bids in California's wholesale markets in November, and waived rules for generating facilities to increase power supplies in December. Later in December, FERC took additional steps to regulate pricing and other aspects of California's wholesale power markets and to create independent \"Governing Boards\" to monitor those markets. In March 2001, FERC issued its \"rst refund order directing sellers to provide refunds of excess amounts charged for certain electric energy sales during the month of January 2001.\" That same month, FERC staff issued a proposal for \"monitoring and mitigating prices prospectively\" in California's wholesale power markets. See the chronology of FERC actions from 2000 to 2002 at https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/les/2020-05/pr-07-26-00.pdf and the links therein. 11The chart for Louisiana illustrates a different example. Hurricane Katrina struck the state in late August 2005, causing widespread destruction of private property and public infrastructure and a near-total exodus from New Orleans. The devastation wrought by the hurricane also brought great uncertainty about how local, state, and federal policymakers and ofcials would respond. Accordingly, Louisiana's EPU -SandEPU -Nseries rose dramatically in the wake of Katrina and, in the case of EPU -S, remained elevated through 2007. As revealed by a glance at Figure 1, nothing similar happened to the cross-state average values of EPU -SandEPU -Nin this period. Indeed, the average EPU series fluctuated around unusually low levels in and around 2005. Finally, the chart for Michigan considers the period before, during, and after the global nancial crisis and Great Recession. National developments gure prominently in the behavior of EPU -S andEPU -Nfor Michigan, partly because the cyclically sensitive auto industry is a major part of Michigan's economy. That makes Michigan unusually exposed to policy uncertainty that causes or responds to national economic fluctuations. For example, the federal government played a major role in rescuing U.S. automobile manufacturers (and their employees) during the Great Recession. The economic uncertainty associated with that rescue effort was accentuated for Michigan by virtue of the state's industrial structure. In summary, the examples highlighted by Figures 5 and 6 illustrate that high state-level EPU can arise in several ways - as a consequence of shocks interacting with bad policy design (Califor- nia's electricity crisis) and the resulting political turmoil (gubernatorial recall), policy reforms designed to lower taxes and promote growth (the Kansas tax experiment), devastating natural disasters that raise policy issues about whether and how a state will rebuild (Katrina), and state economies that are unusually exposed to national developments and sources of policy uncertainty by virtue of their industrial structure (Michigan in the Great Recession). 3.5 The Main Locus of Policy Uncertainty Shifted after the Pandemic Recall from Figures 1 and 2 that our state-level policy uncertainty measures rose enormously in the wake of the pandemic. What's easy to overlook in these gures is the simultaneous shift in the predominant source of policy uncertainty. Figure 7 highlights this shift, showing that the ratio of EPU -StoEPU -Nrose in all but a few states after the pandemic. The ratio rose by a factor of two or more in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, 12Texas and Utah, while falling slightly in Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and South Dakota. The cross-state average value of this ratio rose from 0.65 in the pre- pandemic part of our sample to 1.1 in the period from March 2020 to June 2021. It is perhaps no surprise that the locus of policy uncertainty shifted to state and local policy matters after the pandemic struck. State and local authorities largely determined the parameters of government-mandated restrictions on economic and social activity during the pandemic. The scale of the shift is remarkable nonetheless. It constitutes a major break in the sources of policy-related uncertainty within the federal system of American government. Whether, and how fully, this shift will persist remains to be seen. 4 State-level EPU and Economic Performance This section investigates how economic activity responds to state-level policy uncertainty shocks in vector autoregressive (V AR) models. The results yield clear evidence that upward own-state policy uncertainty shocks foreshadow weaker activity in the state. As we illustrate for California, states sometimes experience a sequence of EPU shocks that drive - or at least foreshadow - material movements in the state-level unemployment rate. 4.1 Panel V AR Analysis We t a panel V AR to monthly, state-level data on ln (EPU -C)and economic activity. We use the composite EPU measure here, because we aim to capture all relevant sources of policy uncertainty for the state - whether due to local, state, national or international developments. Our activity measure is either the state's unemployment rate or the natural log of its employment multiplied by 100. Unless noted otherwise, all specications include state-specic intercept terms and six lags of state-level activity and ln (EPU -C)in each equation. To identify shocks, we use a Cholesky decomposition with ln (EPU -C)placed rst in the recursive causal ordering. We also consider results when placing ln (EPU -C)last in the causal ordering. Appendix A.2 sets forth an explicit statement of our structural V AR and its identication. We estimate the V AR by least squares, using data for 44 states from January 2001 to December 2019. Starting in January 2001 maximizes the number of state-month observations in a balanced 13panel design.14We stop in December 2019 in view of the economy's highly atypical dynamic response to the COVID shock and attendant uncertainty: the lag between the COVID shock and the trough was extraordinarily short, the recession was extremely short-lived, and the early pace of recovery was unusually rapid.15Thus, it makes little sense to include the COVID episode when seeking to characterize the normal dynamic relationship of EPU to economic activity. Figure 8 displays estimated dynamic responses to unit standard deviation ln (EPU -C)shocks, along with 95% condence intervals. Our preferred specication uses the lter proposed by Hamil- ton (2018) with his recommended look-back horizon ( h= 24 ) and one year of lags ( p= 12 ). We also report results using the (HP) lter with \u0015= 129;600, and using unltered data.16Since we lose six observations for lags, our estimation sample runs from July 2001 to De- cember 2019 for V ARs t to raw data or to HP-ltered data. The Hamilton lter uses an extra 35 observations, yielding an estimation sample that runs from June 2004 to December 2019. As the gure shows, own-state policy uncertainty shocks foreshadow lower employment and higher unemployment in the state, with hump-shaped dynamic responses that peak after about one year. The EPU shock responses are modest in size but estimated with good precision, owing to the richness of our state-level data. Using the Hamilton lter, the unemployment rate response to a unit standard deviation upward innovation in ln (EPU -C)peaks 11 to 14 months later at 0.103 percentage points, with a 95% condence interval of 0.05 to 0.15 points. The peak employment response is -0.131 log points after about one year. HP-ltered data yield similar results. Unltered data also yield similar results, except the impulse responses are more persistent. The model- generated forecast errors also imply a modest role for policy uncertainty shocks: They account for 4% of the unemployment rate forecast-error variance at a 12-month forecast horizon and 9% at a 24-month horizon when using the Hamilton lter. 14The omitted states are Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, New Mexico, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. While we have EPU data for New Mexico and West Virginia from 1996, the sample of newspapers (and articles) for these states is thin and variable, resulting in very noisy EPU series. 15U.S. and global stock markets fell about 40% from 17 February to 23 March 2020 in reaction to the esca- lating COVID-19 pandemic, and economic activity underwent a spectacular collapse by mid-April (Davis et al. (2021)). According to the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, the COVID recession lasted only two months, making it the shortest on record back to 1854. See the Committee's announcement on 19 July 2021 at www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating. 16Hamilton (2018) argues that the HP lter produces spurious dynamic relations, and that standard choices of \u0015, which are almost universally drawn from Hodrick and Prescott's original work, are not justied by the data. Despite Hamilton's criticisms, the HP lter remains in widespread use, so we report results for both lters. As it turns out, the two ltering approaches yield similar results in our setting. 14The dynamic response to a ln (EPU -C)shock in Figure 8 is qualitatively similar to what Baker et al. (2016) nd in a 12-country panel V AR but smaller in magnitude. They estimate a peak unemployment rate response of 0.25 percentage points one year after a 90-point shock to the level of EPU, which amounts to 65 log points on an EPU base of 100.17Scaling up to account for the larger EPU shock in their study, our panel V AR yields a peak unemployment response of (0:65=0:45)(0:103) = 0:15percentage points. Thus, our peak unemployment rate response to a same-size EPU shock is only 60 percent as large as theirs. One possible reason is that state-level data are nosier than national data, leading to more attenuation of estimated effects in our setting. Especially for less populous states, monthly activity measures are subject to sampling variability and our EPU measures draw on fewer newspapers. In fact, re-estimating our panel V AR using only the 12 largest states yields a peak unemployment rate response of 0.155 percentage points to a unit standard deviation policy uncertainty shock of size 0.369.18Re-scaling the shock size as before, our 12-state panel V AR yields a peak unemployment response of (0:65=0:369)(0:155) = 0:27 percentage points, slightly larger than Baker et al. (2016) nd. 4.2 Robustness Checks We explored several alternative specications and assumptions as part of our V AR analysis. First, we t analogous V AR models to each state separately. As shown in Appendix Figure A.1, the pattern in Figure 8 holds in the vast majority of states and is not driven by extreme behavior in a few states. Second, we obtained similar results using shorter and longer lags in the V ARs. See Figure A.2, which displays unemployment responses when using the Hamilton lter. Third, plac- ing ln (EPU -C)last in the Cholesky ordering also yields similar results, but peak responses are attenuated. When using the Hamilton lter, placing ln (EPU -C)last reduces the peak unemploy- ment response by about 12% A.3). Fourth, replacing EPU -CwithEPU -N,EPU -S, orEPU -BBD in our V AR models yields qualitatively similar dynamic response functions but smaller peak responses in all cases. For example, when using Hamilton-ltered data, the peak 17Baker et al. (2016) normalize each country's mean EPU level to 100, but the country-specic normalization period does not always coincide with the sample period they use in their V AR estimation. In addition, their multi-country V AR system includes two variables that are unavailable at the state level: a national stock price index, and an industrial production index. For these reasons, our comparison to their EPU shock response magnitude is not exact. 18The 12 largest states are California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia. 15unemployment response to a unit policy uncertainty shock is 23% greater for ln (EPU -C)as com- pared to ln (EPU -N), 18% greater as compared to ln (EPU and 37% greater as compared to ln(EPU -BBD ). This pattern indicates that the broader (and tailored) nature of our ln (EPU -C) measure captures relevant information that the other measures miss. In summary, the estimated dynamic responses to state-level policy uncertainty shocks are of modest size, estimated with good precision, and qualitatively robust to a range of alternative speci- cations and identication assumptions. As we show next, realized EPU shocks can have material effects on state-level unemployment rate movements. 4.3 An Illustration: EPU Shocks and Their Effects in California California is the largest state in the union, and its recent history features a good deal of policy- related economic uncertainty. Motivated by these facts, we now consider the role of EPU shocks as a driver of unemployment rate movements in the state. As a rst step, we re-t our six-lag V AR model using monthly Hamilton-ltered data on the unemployment rate and ln (EPU -C)for California. Here, we exploit the fact that our data for Cal- ifornia extend back to January 1985. After accounting for lags and ltering, our estimation sample runs from June 1988 to December 2019. In identifying the structural V AR, we place ln (EPU -C) last in the recursive causal ordering. This amounts to assuming that policy uncertainty shocks have no same-month impact on the state's unemployment rate, while allowing the unemployment rate shock to contemporaneously affect ln (EPU -C). Figure A.4 displays the estimated dynamic response of California's unemployment rate to the identied ln (EPU -C)shock. The shape is similar to the response function plotted in the upper right panel in Figure 8, but the implied peak effect for a same-size shock is nearly twice as large. To see this, multiply the peak estimated response of California's unemployment rate (0.12) by the ratio of the shock sizes to obtain (0:12)(0:45=:28) = 0:19:Recall that the peak response obtained from the identied panel V AR is only 0.10, even with ln (EPU -C)placed rst in the causal ordering. Thus, the results for California reinforce our earlier conclusion that larger states yield larger estimated effects of policy uncertainty shocks. We now use the structural V AR to examine the contribution of policy uncertainty shocks to movements in California's unemployment rate. Inspecting the time path of structural ln (EPU -C) 16shocks (not shown), we nd large positive values of 59 log points in October 2000 and 42 log points in November, followed by essentially no shock in December (-4 log points) and a sequence of positive shocks from January to May 2001 that average 19 log points. This pattern aligns well with our earlier discussion of the California electricity crisis in 2000-01. Surprisingly though, we nd little trace of California's gubernatorial recall in the path of the structural ln (EPU -C)shocks. Next, we feed the realized shock sequences through a Wold moving-average representation of our structural V AR. This exercise delivers a V AR-based historical decomposition of monthly movements in California's unemployment rate, expressed as deviations from the model-implied equilibrium values. As seen in Figure 9, the electricity crisis produced one of two episodes in which large upward policy uncertainty shocks elevated California's unemployment rate by 50-60 basis points or more for an extended period. The maximal swing in California's unemployment rate due to policy uncertainty shocks is about two percentage points. In short, California's experience shows that policy uncertainty shocks materially affect state-level economic performance. 5 State-Level EPU and Economic Performance during the Pan- demic COVID-19 led to enormous increases in policy uncertainty (Figure 1), more so in some states than others. As an indication of this heterogeneity, the cross-state standard deviation of the change inEPU -Cfrom 2019 to the third quarter of 2020 is 44 log points. We now use this state-level variation to develop evidence on how the pandemic raised policy uncertainty and how, in turn, policy uncertainty relates to state-level economic performance during the pandemic. 5.1 What Drove Policy Uncertainty during the Pandemic? We consider two hypotheses about the drivers of state-level EPU during the pandemic: 1. Policy uncertainty rises with the severity of the pandemic's health consequences. 2. Policy uncertainty rises with the extent of government-mandated restrictions on economic and social activities. 17The rst hypothesis captures the view that greater pandemic severity generates more uncer- tainty about how policy makers will respond and about the economic consequences of their re- sponses. To operationalize this hypothesis, we measure severity as quarterly COVID deaths per capita in the state.19Of course, deaths alone do not capture the full range of health consequences associated with COVID-19. We use data on deaths because they are readily available, of relatively high quality, comparable across states and over time, and correlated with other health outcomes associated with COVID. In short, per capita deaths are a reasonable and practical proxy for the severity of a pandemic's health consequences.20 Our second hypothesis reflects the idea that government restrictions on activity create economic uncertainty, and that more extensive restrictions create greater uncertainty. To operationalize this hypothesis, we consider four types of government orders that were widely deployed during the pandemic: Shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) that conne persons to their residences except when per- forming essential activities. Business closure orders (BCOs) that require \"non-essential\" businesses in multiple industries to halt operations. Restaurant closure orders (RCOs) that cover bars, restaurants, taverns, and other eating fa- cilities while typically allowing take-out and delivery services. School closure orders (SCOs). We combine data on these four types of orders to create a Lockdown Stringency Index for each state from the second quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021. Specically, for a given state and month, we set SIPO = 1when a shelter-in-place order is in effect, 0 otherwise. We assign a fractional value if the SIPO is in effect for a fraction of the month. 19Our data on death rates are from the COVID Data Tracker provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home . We average the daily data to the quarterly level for each state. 20Alternatively, one might consider COVID case rates per capita. However, using case rates to proxy for pandemic severity is highly problematic for two reasons. First, reported case rates depend on testing rates, which vary greatly across states and over time. Second, conditional on contracting COVID, the likelihood of death or serious illness changed greatly as treatments improved, vaccination rates rose, and the demographic mix of infected persons shifted. For both reasons, case rates are an unsuitable measure for our purposes. That said, our results are not materially different when using reported case rates in place of death rates. 18We deneBCO ,RCO , andSCO analogously. In using these state-level indicator variables, we treat RCOs (i.e., restaurant closure orders) as a limited form of the broader BCOs. We treat the combination of a BCO and SCO as equivalent to a SIPO. Thus, we compute the following Lockdown Stringency Index value for each state and month: LSI =MaxfSIPO; 0:75\u0003BCO + 0:25\u0003SCO; 0:25\u0003RCO + 0:25\u0003SCOg; (4) which ranges from 0 to 1. We then average the LSI values over months in the calendar quarter to obtain the state's quarterly Lockdown Stringency Index value. Appendix A.3 describes our data sources for government orders and provides more details about our calculations. To assess hypotheses 1 and 2, we estimate least-squares regressions variable is the log change in EPU -Cfor statesfrom state sduring quarterq;LSI s;qis the Lockdown Stringency Index value for state sinq; and\u000fs;qis an error term. SinceCDR andLSI equal zero in 2019, (5) is effectively a difference-in-difference regression. We t (5) separately for each qin light of frequent references in the popular discourse to \"COVID fatigue,\" \"mounting resistance to government restrictions,\" and the like. These developments may have prompted changes over time in how newspapers reported on pandemic-related policy uncer- tainty. The regulatory approval of anti-COVID vaccines in December 2020 - widely perceived as a watershed development - may also have altered newspaper coverage of uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Table 3 reports the results of estimating (5) for several values of q. To our surprise, we nd no evidence that greater COVID death rates in a state raised its level of policy uncertainty. The marginally signicant coefcient on CDR in column (3) says that states with greater COVID death rates in the fourth quarter of 2020 experienced smaller increases in EPU -Cfrom 2019 to 2020 Q4 - the opposite of the hypothesized effect. None of the other regressions in Table 3 yield a statistically signicant effect of COVID death rates on own-state policy uncertainty. In contrast, we nd strong evidence that states with stricter lockdowns had larger increases in policy uncertainty relative to 2019. This pattern holds for each value of qin Table 3, with some attenuation by the second quarter of 2021. A unit standard deviation between-state LSI 19differential of 0.32 in the third quarter of 2020, for example, implies an increase in state-level policy uncertainty (relative to 2019) of 24 log points. That is more than one-half the standard deviation of the corresponding dependent variable for column (2) in Table 3. Bin scatters displayed in Appendix Figure A.5 indicate that this pattern is not driven by a few outliers among the states. In unreported results, we nd weaker evidence that states with higher values of LSI also experienced an increase in the ratio of EPU -StoEPU -Nafter the onset of the pandemic. In summary, we nd no evidence that the severity of COVID-related health consequences af- fected state-level policy uncertainty during the pandemic. We nd strong evidence that policy uncertainty rose more in states with stricter government-mandated lockdowns on economic and social activity. 5.2 State-Level Economic Performance During the Pandemic We now investigate how state-level economic performance during the pandemic relates to pan- demic severity, lockdown stringency, and policy uncertainty. To do so, we estimate state-level the dependent variable is the change in the unemployment rate for state sfrom 2019 to quarterqforq=2020Q2, 2020Q3, ..., 2021Q2, and s;qis a regression error. Table 4 reports the results. There are three messages. First, we nd no evidence that pandemic severity matters for a state's relative economic performance. Second, states that imposed stricter lockdowns had bigger unemployment rate increases relative to 2019. As an example, consider the regression for q=2020Q2. Multiplying the LSI coefcient by a unit standard deviation differen- tial inLSI values across states in 2020Q2 gives (4:11)(0:24) = 0:99, essentially one percentage point. Analogous calculations for the other values of qyield unemployment responses that range from 0.56 to 0.84 percentage points. Thus, there is clear evidence that stricter lockdowns were as- sociated with sharper state-level unemployment rate increases during the pandemic. Third, there is weaker evidence that state-level unemployment also rose with increases in policy uncertainty dur- ing the pandemic (conditional on lockdown stringency and pandemic severity). Multiplying the coefcient on the log change in EPU -Cin column (2) by its unit standard deviation differential 20across states gives (1:51)(0:244) = 0:66, nearly two-thirds of a percentage point. These results suggest that stricter (and longer) lockdowns and higher policy uncertainty both raised a state's unemployment rate during the pandemic. Still, caution is warranted in drawing causal inferences from these regression results. States may differ in unobserved ways that influ- enced both the vulnerability of their economies to the COVID-19 pandemic and their choices over lockdown policies. In addition, states that imposed stricter lockdowns may also have adopted other policies that raised unemployment. Thus, we see the results in Table 4 as strong motivation for more research into the effects of lockdown mandates and policy uncertainty during the pandemic on unemployment during (and after) the pandemic. 6 Concluding Remarks We tap digital archives for thousands of newspapers to construct three monthly indexes of eco- nomic policy uncertainty (EPU) for each U.S. state: one that captures state and local sources of policy uncertainty ( EPU -S), one that captures national and international sources ( EPU -N), and a composite index that captures both ( EPU -C). Our indexes date to 1985 for some states and are freely available at www.PolicyUncertainty.com with regular updates. Drawing on our indexes and other state-level data, we develop several ndings about the sources of policy uncertainty and its relationship to state-level economic performance: The Importance of State and Local Policy State and local matters are major sources of policy uncertainty. Even before COVID-19, half of all newspaper articles that feed into our composite EPU index discuss state and local policy. That share rose to 62% in the period from March 2020 (when the pandemic struck in force) to June 2021 (the end of our sample period). The Pandemic and Policy Uncertainty The COVID-19 pandemic drove huge increases in policy uncertainty, pushing (average) EPU - Nto 2.7 times its pre-COVID peak and (average) EPU -Sto more than four times its previous peak. Policy uncertainty rose more sharply in states with stricter lockdowns - as measured by the incidence and duration of shelter-in-place orders, business closure orders, restaurant closure orders, 21and school closure orders. This lockdown effect is large relative to between-state variation in pandemic-era jumps in policy uncertainty. Surprisingly, policy uncertainty exhibits no discernible response to pandemic severity, as measured by COVID deaths per capita in the state. Elections and Policy Uncertainty Elections are recurring sources of state-level policy uncertainty. Close elections (vote margin less then four percent) bring especially large increases in policy uncertainty. We estimate that a close presidential election contest raises EPU -Nby 60 percent and a close gubernatorial contest raisesEPU -Sby 35 percent. The richness of our state-level data lets us estimate these election effects with good precision, while controlling for several potential confounders. Other Sources of Policy Uncertainty The cross-state average of our EPU -Nindexes rose in response to 9-11, Gulf Wars I and II, major nancial crises, the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, the 2012 scal cliff episode, the June 2016 Brexit referendum, trade policy tensions during the Trump presidency, and partial federal gov- ernment shutdowns that commenced in October 2013 and December 2018. As we illustrate by example,EPU -Scan rise sharply in reaction to shocks that interact with poor policy design (Cal- ifornia's electricity crisis of 2000-01), political turmoil in the wake of economic mismanagement (California's gubernatorial recall in 2003), major tax reforms that aim to promote economic de- velopment (the Kansas tax experiment of 2012), natural disasters that raise questions about how policymakers will respond (Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina in 2005), and state-specic expo- sures to major national developments and policy actions (Michigan in the Great Recession). Upward Policy Uncertainty Shocks Foreshadow Weaker Economic Activity Upward policy uncertainty innovations in V AR models foreshadow higher state-level unem- ployment rates and lower employment, with peak responses of modest size about one year later. As illustrated by California's experience, realized EPU shocks can generate sizable swings in state- level unemployment rates - about two percentage points in California's case. Lockdowns, Policy Uncertainty, and State-Level Performance during the Pandemic States that imposed stricter lockdowns during the pandemic had bigger jumps in unemploy- ment, conditional on pandemic severity and policy uncertainty. Bigger increases in state-level policy uncertainty during the pandemic also came with bigger increases in unemployment. There 22are sound reasons for caution in drawing causal inferences from these patterns, as we discuss. Nevertheless, they highlight the value of more research into how lockdown stringency and policy uncertainty during the pandemic affected unemployment and other outcomes. The foregoing summary underscores the usefulness of our new state-level EPU indexes. We see several fruitful directions for future research: (1) How does political polarization influence election-related policy uncertainty? It's natural to hypothesize that elections generate more uncertainty when the electorate is more polarized. Baker et al. (2020) nd support for this view in the behavior of national policy uncertainty around U.S. presidential elections. By exploiting state-level data on EPU, polarization and elections, it becomes feasible to scrutinize this hypothesis more carefully and to differentiate among the effects of different types of political polarization. (2) Why has U.S. policy uncertainty drifted upward since the late 1960s? Baker et al. (2014) advance two explanations for this drift. One stresses growth in government spending, taxes, and regulation. Another stresses increased political polarization and its implications for the policy- making process and policy choices. Both explanations nd support in the evidence they amass, but it's hard to develop a convincing evaluation based only on national data. Our work opens the door to a more persuasive assessment that exploits the abundant state-level variation in government growth, polarization, and - now - policy uncertainty. (3) How does uncertainty affect rm-level investment and employment? Much previous re- search tackles this question using panel regression designs and identication strategies that exploit election-related uncertainty and national policy uncertainty measures. Prominent examples include Baker et al. (2016), Gulen and Ion (2016) and Jens (2017). Our state-level EPU indexes greatly expand the measured variation that is available to study how rms respond to policy uncertainty. (4) How does the categorical mix of policy uncertainty vary across states and over time within states? Given the volume and topical density of newspaper articles, it is feasible to construct state- level measures of policy uncertainty for particular policy categories. By adapting the newspaper- based methods in Baker et al. (2016), Husted et al. (2020), and Caldara et al. (2020), one could construct state-level measures of uncertainties related to tax policy, government spending, labor market policy, monetary policy, trade policy, and more. Such measures would provide new tools for studying the drivers of policy uncertainty and effects on rm-level and state-level outcomes. 23References Hites Ahir, Nick Bloom, and Davide Furceri.

We cover all states from January 2006 onward, 38 states from 1996 onward, and 12 states throughout the period from January 1985 to June 2021. 27Figure 2: The Level and Composition of State-Level EPU Index Values, Cross-State Averages, Quarterly Data Notes: The height of each bar is the equal-weighted mean over states of the state-level EPU -Cvalues (composite index) in the indicated quarter. The breakdown within each bar reflects the contribution of articles that contain only national policy terms, those that contain only state and local policy terms, and those that contain both. 28Figure 3: Ratio of EPU -StoEPU -Naround Elections Notes: This chart plots the coefcients from two regressions of state-month values of ( EPU -S/ EPU -N) on a collection of indicator variables for -10, -9, ... 9, 10 months to or from an election of the indicated type. Both regressions include controls for the contemporaneous values of state- level unemployment rates and state-level Coincident Economic Indicators produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The regression for \"Presidential Elections\" also includes controls for common year effects. The regression for \"Gubernatorial Elections\" include controls for both common year effects and common month effects. Observations are weighted by state population. Sample runs from January 1985 to June 2021 (unbalanced across states). Dashed lines show 95% condence intervals with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. 29Figure 4: Histograms of State-Level EPU -NResponses to National and International Events 9-11 Attacks (September 2001) Debt Ceiling Crisis (July 2011) Brexit Referendum (June 2016) Trump Election Win (November 2016) 2013 Government Shutdown (October 2013) 2018 Government Shutdown (December 2018) Notes: Each panel shows the fraction of states with ln( EPU -Ns;t\u000e EPU -Ns;t\u00001) values in the indicated bins (width = 25 log points), where tis the year and month stated in the panel heading. 30Figure 5:EPU -SandEPU -Nin California, 1997 to 2006 Notes: The gure plots quarterly averages of monthly EPU -SandEPU -Nvalues for California in a ten-year period around its 2000-01 electricity crisis and its 2003 gubernatorial recall. 31Figure 6:EPU -SandEPU -Nin Kansas, Louisiana, and Michigan Kansas Louisiana Michigan Notes: This gure plots quarterly averages of monthly EPU -SandEPU -Nvalues for Kansas, Louisiana, and Michigan in selected time periods. 32Figure 7: Average Ratio of EPU -StoEPU -Nby State and Period Notes: Red dots show average monthly ratios of EPU -StoEPU -Nby state in the post-COVID period from March 2020 to June 2021. Blue dots show average ( EPU -S/EPU -N) values in the pre-COVID period before March 2020. Sample start dates in the pre-COVID period vary across states from 1985-2006, as listed in Appendix Table A.1. We order states by the average pre-COVID values of (EPU -S/EPU -N). 33Figure 8: Employment and Unemployment Rate Responses to Unit Standard Deviation ln (EPU -C) Shocks 100*ln(Employment) Unemployment Rate Notes: Each panel shows estimated dynamic responses of the activity measure to a unit standard EPU -Cshock (with 95% condence intervals), the peak response, and standard deviations of the identied shocks. To obtain these results, we lter the data as indicated, t a two-equation panel V AR model by least squares to monthly state-level data for 44 states, and place EPU -Crst in a Cholesky ordering. The V AR system has six lags of each variable and state-specic intercepts. The estimation sample runs from July 2001 to December 2019 when using raw and HP-ltered data, and from June 2004 to December 2019 when using Hamilton-ltered data. 34Figure 9: Historical Decomposition of California's Unemployment Rate Movements from June 1988 to December 2019 Notes: This gure shows the historical decomposition of unemployment rate movements implied by a structural V AR system with six lags t to Hamilton-ltered monthly data on the unemploy- ment rate and ln(EPU-C) for California from June 1988 to December 2019. In ltering the raw data (available from January 1985), we adopt Hamilton's recommendation to look back over a two-year business cycle (h=24) with one year of lags (p=12), which uses 35 observations. Since we lose six additional observations due to lags in the V AR specication, our estimation sample runs from June 1988 to December 2019. We recover structural shocks from the reduced-from V AR by placing ln(EPU-C) last in a recursive causal ordering of the reduced-form V AR innovations. Reversing the causal ordering yields a very similar decomposition. 35Table 1: Term Sets Terms Economy economic, economy Uncertainty uncertainty, uncertainties, uncertain Policy Sets: EPU -N White House, Congress, Congressional, Federal Reserve, The Fed, Monetary Policy, Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, NIH, FTC, Patent and Trademark Ofce, USDA, IRS, Department of Defense, National Security, Depart- ment of Homeland Security, FDA, Federal Housing Administration, SEC, CFPB, Department of Labor, Small Business Administration, NLRB, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Immigration and Naturalization service, EPA, FERC, HUD, Bureau of Land Management, Department of Interior, Department of Education, FCC, Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Transportation, US Treasury, Department of Treasury, DoJ, Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, Presidential election, Congressional election EPU -S Legislature, State House of Representatives, Michigan House of Representatives, State Senate, Michigan Senate, (Michigan) Governor, State Attorney General, Michigan Attorney General, zoning, mayor, city council, town council, initiative, referendum, Department of Labor and Economic Growth, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michigan Department of Public Health, Michigan Charitable Gaming, Michigan Lottery, Michigan Gaming Control Board, Min- nesota DPS Gambling Enforcement, Michigan Public Service Commission, Michigan Insurance Division, Michigan Ofce of Financial and Insurance Regulation, Corporations, Securities and Commercial Licensing Bureau, Michigan Department of Transportation EPU -BBD regulation, decit, white house, legislation, congress, federal reserve, the fed, regulations, regulatory, decits, congres- sional, legislative, legislature Notes: In practice, we include the full names of listed agencies as well as common abbreviations (e.g., both IRS and Internal Revenue Service).

Explanatory variables are state-level values of the COVID Death Rate per 100,000 persons and the Lockdown Stringency Index value in the indicated quarter. The stringency index aggregates information about shelter-in-place orders, business clo- sure orders, restaurant closure orders and school closure orders, as explained in Section 5.1. See Appendix Table A.2 for summary statistics of the variables. Huber-White robust standard errors are in parentheses. 38Table 4: How State-Level Unemployment Rates Relate to Lockdown Stringency, Death Rates, and Policy Uncertainty During the Pandemic Dependent Variable: log change in state-level unemployment rate from 2019 to indicated quarter (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Quarter 2020Q2 0.324 0.383 0.251 Notes: Each column pertains to a separate regression, where the dependent variable is the change in the state-level unemployment rate from 2019 to the indicated calendar quarter. Explanatory variables are state-level values of (a) the COVID Death Rate per 100,000 persons in the indicated quarter, (b) the Lockdown Stringency Index value in the indicated quarter, and (c) the log change in the state-level composite EPU index value from 2019 to the indicated quarter. See Appendix Table A.2 for summary statistics of the variables.

A.2 V AR Models, Identication, and Additional Results This section of the appendix describes our structural V AR models, articulates the assumptions we adopt to identify them, and presents additional results referenced in the main text. Recall that we t panel V AR models by OLS to monthly data on Yst= (ln(EPU -Cst);UN st)0, whereUNstis the unemployment rate for state sin montht, and ln (EPU -Cst)is the natural log of the state's composite EPU index value in month t.21We treat ln (EPU -Cst)andUNstas covariance stationary processes. Our baseline 2x2 common and ~ sis a 2x1 vector of state-specic constants. Our structural V AR embeds two assumptions that warrant brief remarks. First, we neglect spatial interactions, e.g., own-state shocks with spillover effects on other states. While it would be interesting to explore such relationships, they are beyond the scope of our analysis. Second, following standard practice, we assume for each sthat corr (\u000fEPU st;\u000fUN st) = 0 in the time-series di- mension. Although it often passes without mention in the structural V AR literature, the assumption of contemporaneously uncorrelated structural innovations (for a given geographic unit) is a sub- stantive restriction. See Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) for additional discussion and an analysis of identication when relaxing this assumption. 21The main text also considers V ARs with ln (EMP st)in place ofUNst, whereEMP stdenotes employment in statesand montht. We couch the discussion here in terms of the unemployment rate for the sake of concreteness. 40Given (A.1), we consider various assumptions to identify the structural innovations - \"shocks,\" as we call them in the main text. For example, to obtain the impulse response functions in Figure 8, we posit a recursive structure that lets us decompose the reduced-form V AR errors (i.e., the OLS regression residuals) according to est=B\u000fst: et\u00110 \u000fUN st1 A (A.2) That is, we identify shocks by placing ln (EPU -C)rst in a recursive causal ordering. Assumption (A.2) also sufces to identify the elements of the Amatrices in (A.1). Inverting the identied structural V AR yields moving-average representation for state s, Yst= s+1X i=0Ci\u000fs;t\u0000i (A.3) The elements in the rst column and second row of the Cimatrices give the dynamic responses of UNs;t+ito a unit-size \u000fEPU st shock fori= 0;1;2;:::;as plotted in Figure 8. Figures A.1, A.2 and A.3 report additional V AR-based results referenced in Section 4.1. To obtain the response functions displayed in Figure A.1, we t the reduced-form V AR separately for each state and rely on recursive ordering (A.2) to recover structural V ARs with distinct AiandB matrices for each state, which yields the state-specic dynamic response functions plotted in the gure. For Figure A.2, we alter the lag lengths in the baseline V AR model (A.1), as indicated in the gure, and again rely on the recursive ordering (A.2) for identication. For Figure A.3, we place ln (EPU -C)last in the recursive causal ordering to identify (A.1). Figure 9 in Section 4.3 reports a V AR-based historical decomposition of fluctuations in Cal- ifornia's unemployment rate. To obtain this decomposition, we t a V AR to the monthly data for California and place ln (EPU -C)last in the recursive causal ordering to identify structural shocks and obtain the structural V AR. We then use the Wold moving-average representation of the structural V AR to obtain the model-implied contributions of the shocks (i.e., past and current values of\u000fEPU t and\u000fUN t) to the deviation of California's unemployment rate from its equilibrium value at each t. See slides 76 and 77 in Cesa-Bianchi (undated) for an explicit statement of the decomposition. 41A.3 Measuring the Stringency of Government Lockdown Orders We obtain daily state-level data on shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs), non-essential business clo- sure orders (BCOs), restaurant closure orders (RCOs), and school closure orders (SCOs) from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) at https://www.kff.org/report-section/state-covid-19-data-and- policy-actions-policy-actions/ (accessed November 2021). We average the daily state-level values to calendar months. If a given order type was in place during only part of the month, we discount the corresponding indicator value accordingly. For example, if a state had a shelter-in-place order in effect for half the month, we set its SIPO value for that month to one-half. For April and May 2020, we use data with more geographic granularity. In particular, we obtain weekly, county-level data on SCOs from Keystone Strategy at https://www.keystonestrategy.com/coronavirus-covid19-intervention-dataset-model/ (accessed 28 October 2020). We obtain county-level data for SIPOs, BCOs, and RCOs from Goolsbee et al. (2020), who provide the dates on which these orders went into effect and were lifted. We use their dates to determine whether a given order type was in effect for each county by week, regardless of whether the order originated at the state or county level.22We then aggregate county-level indicator values for April and May 2020 to the state level using county-level population shares.23 Armed with our monthly state-level values for SIPO ,BCO ,RCO andSCO; we plug them into equation (4) in the main text to obtain monthly, state-level values for our Lockdown Stringency Index. As a nal step, we average over months in the calendar quarter for each state to obtain the quarterly, state-level index values. A.4 Summary Statistics for Variables Used in Section 5 Analysis Table A.2 reports summary statistics for the variables used in the regression analyses reported in main text Tables 3 and 4. 22In some instances, their observations reflect city-level government orders. We omit city-level orders that do not extend to the entire county. The Goolsbee et al. (2020) data end in May 2020, which precludes us from extending the granular geographic approach beyond that month. 23When aggregating over counties to obtain a state-level SCO value, we restrict attention to counties with SCO data. In effect, we treat missing SCO data as missing at random. In practice, this assumption is unlikely to matter much, because counties with SCO data account for most of the population. 42Figure A.1: Unemployment Rate Responses to Unit Standard Deviation Own-State ln (EPU -C) Shocks, Using a Separate V AR Model for Each State Notes: We t a separate six-lag V AR for each state using the same data as in Figure 8. We identify the structural V ARs by placing ln (EPU -C)rst in a recursive ordering. Each line in one of the charts shows a single state's dynamic unemployment rate response to a unit standard deviation innovation in the state's identied policy uncertainty shock. 43Figure A.2: Unemployment Rate Responses with Alternative Lag-Length Specications Notes: The middle chart is identical to the upper right chart in Figure 8, which uses Hamilton- ltered data. The other two charts report unemployment rate response functions for otherwise identical models that consider shorter or longer lag-length specications, as indicated. See the notes to Figure 8 for additional information. 44Figure A.3: Unemployment Rate Responses with Alternative Recursive Ordering Notes: We place ln (EPU -C)last in the recursive ordering. Otherwise, the V AR models behind the response functions in this gure are identical to the ones used in the right column of Figure 8. 45Figure A.4: Dynamic Response of California's Unemployment Rate to a Unit Standard Deviation Policy Uncertainty Shock Notes: This gure shows the dynamic response of the unemployment rate to a unit standard devia- tion (0.28) policy uncertainty shock obtained from a structural V AR system t to Hamilton-ltered monthly data on the unemployment rate and ln(EPU-C) for California from June 1988 to Decem- ber 2019. Our unltered data are available from January 1985. In ltering the data, we adopt Hamilton's recommendation to look back over a two-year business cycle (h=24) with one year of lags (p=12), which uses 35 observations. Since we use an additional six lags in the V AR, our estimation sample starts in June 1988 and runs through December 2019. We recover structural shocks from the reduced-from V AR by placing ln(EPU-C) last in a recursive causal ordering of the reduced-form V AR innovations. Reversing the causal ordering yields a very similar response function. 46Figure A.5: How Log Changes in EPU -Cfrom 2019 to the Indicated Quarter Vary with Lockdown Stringency Index Values in the Quarter, Bin Scatters of State-Level Observations Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Notes: There are 51 underlying state-level observations for each panel.
