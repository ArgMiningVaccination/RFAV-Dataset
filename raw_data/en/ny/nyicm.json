Everyday Acupuncture Podcast Everyday Acupuncture Podcast - - Health & Fitness - Contrary to popular belief, acupuncture is not just sticking needles into people.

L.Ac Real Mushrooms 25% Off Your First Order! I'm Mary Beth Huwe, my husband Brian, and I run Huwe Acupuncture, an acupuncture and herbal medicine clinic in a super tiny town in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. We are often asked, what does acupuncture treat? And we explain it in this way. Acupuncture treats people not diseases. That means no matter who you are or what you're suffering from, acupuncture is an option for you, not just an alternative or a last ditch. But an actual, serious, thoughtful medicine. We've helped people aged one month to 92 years with conditions such as fatigue, headaches, menstrual problems, joint injuries, and pain, H I V, digestive complaints, back aches, earaches, nose bleeds, nightmares, constipation, anxiety, cancer, insomnia, nausea, brain injury, neuropathy, pregnancy, depression, lupus, diabetes, and smoking. And each of those individuals, Individualized care. That's because effective acupuncture is specifically tailored for an individual at a certain place in time. For example, if five people came to me today for treatment of headaches, they would not all receive the same treatment. , each individual's point prescription would depend upon the very detailed picture of pathology, the location of the headache, the type of pain, the time at which it occurs, the triggers, the pulse picture, the tongue. Each of these components is significant, both in its own right and in relationship to the other components. Furthermore, if those same five people with headaches came again next week, they would not receive the same points they received today. I reevaluate each individual each time, and though I may keep the treatment targeted toward the same general channels, I won't necessarily do so. Of course, we cannot legally guarantee a cure, and we wouldn't want to make such a claim even if we could. What we do put forward is that even if acupuncture doesn't cure your disease, save your life, or remove your symptoms, it will very likely change the way you feel about your disease life and symptoms. And this way, acupuncture greatly and profoundly reduces suffering. Some people wonder is acupuncture for. . The short answer is yes. Acupuncture is for anyone who wants it. Maybe you're in the best shape of your life, or maybe you feel like you're falling through the cracks of modern healthcare. Maybe you don't notice your body unless it's hurting you. Maybe you have a vague sense that something is lacking in your health, or maybe you're very sick. Acupuncture is multidimensional. It has something to offer every one of those maybes because it is a medicine that takes the full constellation of the individual of you into account.

I'm Michael Max from Yong Kang Chinese Medicine Clinic in St Louis, MO. And today I'm here to answer the question.... Will one session of acupuncture fix my problem? this is common question. And it shines a light on our magical thinking about acupuncture. That it's either magic or mumbo jumbo, or a wing and prayer attempt at stepping out of the box of convention and maybe getting lucky. One of the problems with acupuncture is that there are times people indeed do get dramatic relief from a single treatment. And so acupuncture gets a reputation as being magically effective. But for the most part we have to grow into our health, the same way we grew into our illnesses....over time. One of the curious things I noticed from practicing acupuncture that often people have a big change in how they feel after a treatment, and then the next time they come in the request is--- \"whatever you did last time, do that again.\" Which almost never brings a satisfiying result, because it's impossible to do what we did last time. And the reason for that is you're no longer the same as you were last time. Things are already different. There's that phrase about you can't step in the same river twice, because the river is in constant motion and so are we. The trick, if there is a trick, is to see what would be helpful in this moment, and our \"this moment\"....that's always changing. I suppose if we were machines then we could be fixed with a particular acupuncture protocol, like changing out the oxygen sensor or brake pads on a car. But, we are biological beings. it's more complicated. And if you've got any sort of complex issue, you already know what I'm getting at here. Things take time. Baking bread, raising children, growing orchids, developing in your career, or learning a new skill. As you likely already know, our health and wellbeing is the result of what we do over time. It helps to be realistic. So, it's unlikely that acupuncture will be a one and done proposition. Just like eating well for a week is not going to change how your clothes fit. But if acupuncture is something you've been thinking about and want to give a try, then to give it a fair trial... plan on a series of 4-6 treatments. Within that time time, you'll get a sense of how it might be helpful for you. As ever, judge by the results you get. To give acupuncture a try, contact your local licensed Acupuncturist.

This is Dr. Neal Sivula. I'm a veterinarian and owner of Dancing Paws Animal Wellness Center, a holistic veterinary practice located in beautiful Richfield, Ohio. Today I'll answer the question- \"I love acupuncture for myself, can I get it for my pet?\" Of course, you can! The basic acupuncture certification program for Veterinarians in the United States is a post-graduate course, usually around 200 hours in length. We learn Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupuncture point locations, case management, and in some courses, students study herbal medicine as well. Some courses only teach TCM, others teach a combination of TCM and Medical Acupuncture, and some teach Medical Acupuncture exclusively. All courses offer a certification examination upon completion of the course and most require internship hours with a certified doctor and the submission of a few case reports to verify that the candidate can think logically through an acupuncture case. Like our human acupuncture colleagues, the basic training is only the start of our journey in acupuncture. Our certifications require that we participate in approved continuing education courses in acupuncture. These range in topic from refresher courses on basic acupuncture theory all the way to instruction in other techniques like the Balance Method or Scalp Acupuncture, or in other philosophies like Classical Chinese Medicine. Certification is just a jumping off point for every acupuncturist I know, continual education makes us better acupuncturists. Once trained, veterinarians use acupuncture in all sorts of ways in their practice. I am fortunate in that I am able to limit my practice to holistic medicine, while other doctors may offer acupuncture as something that they provide alongside their allopathic services. So how should one find an acupuncturist for their pet? That can be a little complicated, as we don't have a centralized database for all veterinary acupuncturists. Resources that provide practitioner location services include the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, the American Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture, Chi University, Curacore Academy, the Canine Rehabilitation Institute, and the College of Integrative Veterinary Therapies. Of course, doctors that are seeking acupuncture patients will have that service listed on their practice websites as well. If you're interested in hearing more about holistic veterinary medicine, I host \"The Integrative Veterinarian\" podcast where I have conversations with veterinarians and discuss their training and their lives as holistic practitioners. Acupuncture is as powerful in our animal friends as it is in humans, so don't forget to consider acupuncture when thinking about your pet's health!

Can children really have acupuncture? I'm Rebecca Avern, a paediatric acupuncturist at The Panda Clinic and The Little Acupuncture Room in Oxford UK. When I tell people what I do for a living, a common response is - can children really have acupuncture? The simple answer to that question is a resounding 'yes'. And I'm going to explain to you why. Firstly, acupuncture is a lot more than purely needles. It includes many other, non-insertive techniques that are both gentle and effective, and that are often used with children. These involve medical massage (specifically a system called paediatric tui na) and techniques that involve using small tools to gently stroke and tap the acupuncture channels. There are also some really useful modern innovations which are often used with children, such as small seeds which can be stuck on acupuncture points and low-level laser pens which can be used as an alternative to needles. Despite what you might think, when approached in the right way the majority of children are actually OK with having acupuncture needles! The needles we use even finer than those used on adults - they may be just .12mm thick. A skilled paediatric practitioner will have developed a child-friendly needle technique which means that the child will barely feel the needle. Also, and crucially important, when working with children, the needles are never retained so there is no need for an energetic three year old to have to stay still! A good paediatric acupuncturist will make a decision with each individual child as to which of the many tools they have available is most suitable and, crucially, which will be best-tolerated by that child. They will understand the importance of a child feeling good about their acupuncture treatments. Rapport is everything in medicine, but even more so when it comes to children. The acupuncturist will prioritise building a therapeutic relationship with the child, ensuring they feel safe and relaxed. So, hopefully, you can now understand that acupuncture is actually more than possible with children, and that there are many gentle, non-needle techniques that are used. Most kids actually really enjoy their treatments! I would like to add one more point which is not directly answering our original question but which is nevertheless hugely important. Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of many, many childhood conditions, both physical, mental and emotional. There is an ever-increasing body of research which highlight its benefits in a diverse range of conditions, from bedwetting, to ADHD, to colic, to cerebral palsy to name but a few. Finally, when looking for a practitioner, do find one who has some specialist training in paediatrics.

I Already Feel Healthy! with Heidi Markland LAc.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/eap-099-why-try-acupuncture-i-already-feel-healthy/id955298280?i=1000580162772) EAP-099 Why Try Acupuncture? I Already Feel Healthy! with Heidi Markland LAc. Real Mushrooms 25% Off Your First Order! Hi, this is Heidi Markland with Ancient Spring Acupuncture in beautiful Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Today I'm gonna talk about a question that I often get asked when someone first finds out that I'm an acupuncturist. So, while most people are familiar with the idea of acupuncture treating pain, many people ask what if I feel pretty healthy overall, why should I try acupuncture? First, if we look at the historical Chinese texts about acupuncture, we know that it was originally used as a preventative medicine. Dating back to 3 rd century B.C., the Yellow Emperor's Classic speaks of treating disease by preventing illness before it even begins. 1 Chinese medicine is about keeping the body in balance. A good practitioner does this by observing a patient. So, imbalances can be seen in inspecting facial complexion, body type, fingernails, tongue appearance, and feeling the patient's pulse, among other things that we can observe. Let's look at an example of someone with very few to no health complaints. She's an active 56-year-old that seeks acupuncture because she wants to be able to stay as active as possible. In looking at her fingernails, one may notice some dryness and brittleness. Her complexion may show some redness in the cheeks and the tongue may be slightly redder than average. Along with some patient questioning, we may want to start acupuncture treatment focused on nourishing the yin. This will help prevent further imbalance and because the patient wants to stay active, we would also add points that support the sinews and muscles. Furthermore, the patient wants to make sure that her thinking remains sharp so we can add points to actually boost brain and marrow. Maybe the patient mentions that she feels her eyesight is beginning to lose its sharpness. We can add points for that! We can add points to help clear the eyes and strengthen them. If you're looking for more scientific reasoning......well, research shows that the insertion of acupuncture needles can create effects due to modulation of the somato-sensory system and of the autonomic nervous system. Have I lost you? Basically, this means that science proves that acupuncture has a whole-body effect by tapping into the nervous system. Ear acupuncture, specifically, has been shown to stimulate the vagal nerve, which is responsible for the regulation of internal organ functions. And if these reactions weren't enough, it's proven that the body releases feel good endorphins with the insertion of acupuncture needles. So, at the very least, you should leave an acupuncture session with a sense of well-being and stress reduction. [2,3] Do you have more acupuncture related questions?

How Medicinal Mushrooms Help Immune Function? I'm Dr. Mason Bresett Chief Science Advisor and Naturopathic Doctor from Real Mushrooms in British Columbia, Canada. I'm here today to answer the common question I hear about how mushrooms help the immune system? Firstly, mushrooms have been used as medicine for thousands of years and our understanding of them has grown exponentially with modern research and paired with traditional knowledge. Mushrooms have the unique ability to inform our immune system to increase our defence system. Mushrooms have this impact due to their nutritional components, complex sugars called beta-d-glucans and their adaptogenic actions. These immune supporting compounds can even be found in your local market mushrooms, in the produce aisle. Mushrooms can help your immune system by fortifying how the 2 parts of our immune system The first is called the innate immune system. It is our immune systems first response to an invader like a cold virus sort of like first responders, who ever can get there goes.. It is non specific - meaning your immune system sends broad acting immune cells to help neutralize the threat. Mushrooms help up regulate the hard working immune cells working behind the scene here. 2) The second place mushrooms help the immune system is The adaptive immune system. This part of your immune system creates specific immune cells to help defeat or neutralize the cold virus. This system also creates memory to help the system respond better the next time a similar microbe is encountered. 3) Mushrooms are also known as adaptogens, which means they can help the body to develop more resilience to stress, stress has a detrimental effect on the immune system. The adaptogenic properties of mushrooms help fortify the immune system. Mushrooms are also supportive of gut health, the majority of our immune system, resides in our gut. This is why mushrooms have been increasing in popularity to help with immune prevention. Mushrooms paired with acupuncture is a great way to increase your immune system. Chinese medicine practitioners and acupuncturists are trained in nutrition and herbal based formulas which often include medicinal mushrooms. Please visit your local acupuncturist who can tell you more and help you with your immune system.
