The social phenomena of our time str ongly indicate that human beings are evolving spiritually and are entering a new phase. World events evident in the relations between East and West, the growth of terrorism and violence, the increasing sharpness of the intellect and our relation to techno logy all point to this. Rudolf Steiner pointed to the threshold between physical and spiritual experience and the dangers of crossing this unprepared. Modern symptoms now indicate that mankind is crossing this threshold as part of our evolution. A more penetrating understanding of the individual rather than of group affiliations is urgently needed as an antidote. This can open up the positive side of these changes. Nick Thomas will be talking about these issues and will take questions afterwards. Donat ions for Nick's travelling expenses on the door. Nick Thomas was the Chairman of the Anthroposophical Society for many years and recently retired. From Friday Flier 15/01/2009 (Small Ad) Thursday, 22nd January 2009, 7.45pm Beuys was one of the most influ ential artists in the 1970/80's. Today his ideas still have the power to create waves. He was a founder member of the German Green Party, an environmental artist and campaigner. His statement 'Everyone an Artist' encapsulates the importance he gave to art . He wanted to expand the very notion of art. He believed that his teaching was his most important art. From an early age Beuys began to study the works of Rudolf Steiner and was a member of the Anthroposophical Society. Some argue that all his art was in fluenced by Rudolf Steiner. Tickets \u00a34.00 each including light refreshments. Attendance is limited, so booking is advisable. Talks held at Taurus Crafts. Tickets available from: Cliff Gorman, WorthAttention , Taurus Crafts, on Flier 24 /09 2008 To end on a personal note. Greta Rushbrooke with a bit of help from me started this school back in the mists of time. Since then many dozens of parents have given vast amounts of time to make our school into a unique community and a very successful centre for Steiner education. For me the community factor was as important as the educational one. I think it is vital that the community thrives alongside the Academy. Suddenly we are surrounded by suits and regulations and government interventions but at the centre of it all is the College of teachers and Anthroposophy from which the whole brilliant enterprise derives. And encircling the centre are the children and the parents and all those who work for the school: the community. From Friday Flier 1 /10/ 2010 Diary Date: Thursday 14 October School Doctor From Friday Flier 22/05/ 2009 Diary Date: Thursday 18 June School Doctor visit From Friday Flier 26/02/ 2010 Appeal from the Homeopathy Organisation? Many of the families in the Steiner School community choose to use homeopathy for our family's health. As you may have noticed there is currently a campaign (by two cancer doctors) to discredit homeopathy and get it thrown out of the NHS and off the shelves at Boots ... at the very least - who knows if it will then go on to be illegalised along with the vitamin -herbal natural health supplements that have been removed from sale in the pa st 2 years because they did not have a medicine licence which costs \u00a3500,000 per individual product. You can no longer buy Weleda euphrasia eye drops but antibiotic eye drops are available over the counter. Homeopathy is the second biggest form of healthca re in the world, and is recognised by the World Health Organisation. The dilution of homeopathic remedies at 5C and 6C is the same dilution as that of the body's chemistry in the brain and endocrine system (as taught at French medical school). The amount o f rock in the pill is a misleading argument. Many pills we are prescribed contain a small quantity of substance but have a considerable effect on the body's and brain's functions. The Nobel prize winning virologist Professor Luc Montagnier, a French virolo gist who co -discovered HIV and who won the Nobel Prize in 2008, has proved the way homeopathy works on viral replication and demonstrated through thermodynamics the effect at a molecular level of higher dilution and intense shaking to make higher potency r emedies. http://www.homeopathic.com/articles/view,134 The science is there is anyone wants to refer to it, but it is not being mentioned in this campaign. Lazy journalism is not citing the medic al and scientific evidence for homeopathy's effectiveness. How many of us have looked up the biochemical effects of how a headache pill or anti -infl amatory works before taking it? Few. But we read the side eff ects on the liver, heart and kidneys. Even th ose who see a homeopath privately will appreciate the value of homeopathic medicine being recognised by the NHS and remedies being available on the NHS. The homeopathic hospital at Tunbridge Wells was closed down last year by this campaign. The homeopathic hospital in London is under threat and has had referrals from GP banned by local health authorities. Doctors at the homeopathic hospital in Bristol have treated many children at our school eff ectively. It also affects anthroposophical medicine that our s chool doctors use.Make your comments heard, if you want homeopathy to remain a health care choice. There's a letter you can dow nload on the campaign for homeopathy website and send to your GP or to the House of Commons: http://www.hmc21.org/#/campaign/4533514916 and a chance to add your cases of when homeopathy worked for you or someone you know to lend support to the campaign and for what it's worth there's a poll on GMTV (where homeopathy is unlikely to be the predominant health choice) \"Do you believe homeopathy is an effective form of treatment?\" http://www.gm.tv/polls/45561 - homeopathyeffectiveness -online -poll.h tml STEINER BOOK REVIEW The Road to Malaba - A Tale of Destiny and Identity The Road to Malaba takes the reader along on an uncommon journey by a volunteer (a non -teacher) working for a Steiner School. This book is a memoire that reads like a novel and will interest teachers, trustees and. Parents. It is reviewed by Karl Hoff mann in the December issue 2009 of Sphere, the New Zealand anthroposophical journal. From Friday Flier 12/06/2009 School Doctor Visits Many of us have already had the opportunity t o meet Dr Hedda , either through consultations or by attending her talks. Dr Hed da has been visiting our school for the last couple of years once or twice a term. Ideally it would be great if every child could have the opportunity to be seen. The reality, though, is that not only does Dr Hedda have a very busy schedule - she also works in many other institutions - but also the costs for the school would be very high. Therefore, we have been very carefully organizing the list of children according to the spec ific needs of each class, trying also to keep a certain flexibility for cases that appear to be urgent. The procedure for a child to be included on this list is as follows. The kindergarten or class teacher, in consultation with parents, refers a child w ho might be in need of extra support in their general development and health, if that is directly affecting their learning/educational progress. In the case that the parents wish to refer their child to the Doctor Hedda , they must get in touch first with the Class Teacher to explain their concern and come to an agreement that it is a 'School Doctor' situation, and they will then be put on the school's 'Dr's Waiting List'. If a parent would like to book a private appointment to see Dr Hedda , either in Br istol or Stroud , please contact Niki Nakamura in the Admin. Office and she will give you the contact numbers. At present, Dr Hedda' school visits are always full, and her time with us is very tight so there are no spaces for private sessions. We are willin g to put together a list of parents who wish their child to be seen on a private basis here. As soon as we have a good number, we could book Dr Hedda for a 'Private Consultation Day', which would probably be on a Saturday (as Dr Hedda suggested when I rece ntly asked her about that). Costs (given by Dr Hedda): \u00a365 for 1st app of 45 minutes; \u00a330 for a follow -up app of 30 minutes. If you are interested, please leave your name and contact number in Karla's pigeonhole. Nevertheless, this will be most likely to h appen from next term onwards. It has been a fruitful year as so many children and, in consequence, many classes have been supported through this process. We are indeed very 'lucky' to have had such an opportunity to have Dr Hedda with us so far. Her last v isit for this school year will be on 18 June. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of all the teachers and the community, to express our gratitude and thanks to Dr Hedda for travelling all these miles to be with us and our children with such de votion and care for the past year and hopefully, for many more to come. Wishing you all a healthy end of term!

They also wonder if the y are accompanying a school trip, when should they give the remedies that we in school provide. Homeopathy is a wonderful way of treating ourselves and our families in a gentle and effective way and once you know a little bit about it, it is very easy to u se for first aid and minor illnesses. I will be running both day courses, probably at the weekend, and also morning sessions hopefully at school between drop off and pick up that will give you information and enough confidence to use a range of homeopathic remedies for yourself and your family. If you are interested in any of these courses please come and speak to me in reception or phone me on 01981 241 456 . I would like to get an idea of interest before I set up some dates but I hope they will be after half term.
