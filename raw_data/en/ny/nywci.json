The essential oils (EOs) and their chemical constituents are known to be active against a wide range of viruses. Oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes present in EOs contribute to their antiviral effect. Since the new strain of coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), is still not completely understood, it is not yet possible to find which EOs will offer the best level of protection. More is learned about this virus on an almost weekly basis, but it could still be some considerable time before a cure is found. However, it is plausible to assume that some of the EOs and related terpenes are likely to offer a measurable level of defense in the same way that they do with many other known viruses.

INTRODUCTION The 2019 new Coronavirus, now named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has produced an epidemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started on 31 December 2019 in China and spread to different regions and countries. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak a worldwide health emergency. People who get sick from the novel SARS-CoV-2 may have moderate clinical symptoms, such as a fever or cough, or more severe ones, such as pneumonia [1-3]. The WHO held an update conference at their headquarters in Geneva (Switzerland) on February 11, 2020 to inform the public and people on the current extent of SARS-CoV-2, which they have now recognized as 'people enemy number one'. At the conference it was proclaimed that there have now been over 65,000 human cases described around the globe, causing the deaths of more than 1,900 people, almost solely in China. This novel specie of Cioronavirus has not formerly been identified or known in people prior to the epidemic described in the region of Wuhan (China) last year (December 2019) [4,5] (Figure 1). More recently (February 26, 2020), more than 2,700 people in China have died from COVID-19, as well as 52 people in other countries. Medical establishments will check any mortality in other regions or countries. Outdoor of the lockdown within China, coronavirus disease-19 cases are speeding up across the planet. The SARS-CoV-2 has really hopped the protection line. Currently, it's a real pandemic, with countries all over the globe (Figure 2), recording massive percent growth in the cases of infected human [5]. At present, we know it has got an epidemic status in South Korea and Japan. But overnight, novel human cases have been confirmed by the Iran, US, UAE, Italy, USA, Lebanon, Egypt and Algeria, among others [6,7]. WHAT IS CORONAVIRUS? Coronaviruses (CoV), members of the Coronaviridae family, are enveloped viruses that contain non-segmented, positive- stranded genomic RNA (RiboNucleic Acid) [8,9]. Coronaviruses are a great family of viruses found in both humans and animals. Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that possess large viral RNA genomes [5]. Although SARS-CoV-2 is categorized in the beta-Coronaviruses group, it is different from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CentralNadjib genes <80% nucleotide identity and 89.10% nucleotide SARS-CoV genes [9,10]. The analysis of CoV ultrastructure has shown that they form pleomorphic particles that are incompletely spherical but display variations in shape and size (80-120nm in diameter). The whole SARS-CoV replication cycle take places in the cytoplasm. Overall, enveloped viruses are capable to use a diversity of cellular membranes at several steps of the virus life cycles [11-13]. Coronaviruses causes numerous illnesses comprising gastroenteritis, bronchitis and hepatitis systemic diseases on animal and humans. Both viral factors and host affect the illness severity in animals and the Coronavirus virulence. The sickness is usually most severe in babies [14,15]. Some infected people and are known to cause complaint, ranging from the common cold and fever to more severe illnesses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Further, this Coronavirus is not the same as SARS, but it is from the similar family of viruses. Identification of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the cause of SARS in the spring of 2003 stimulated research in this field [16]. HOW CORONAVIRUS SPREADS Scientists and researchers are now investigating the new SARS-CoV to study more about how it contaminates persons. This SARS-CoV is a respiratory virus that extents mainly through direct contact with an infected human through respiratory droplets generated when they sneeze or cough, or through discharge from the nose or droplets of saliva. This is why it is extremely significant that every human should have good body hygiene. For example, the covering the nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing avoid the spread of viruses and microorganisms. Also, it is very imperative for people to wash and rinse their hands frequently with either soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub [17,18]. As of this writing, researchers report that most germs and viruses do not stay active for very long on surfaces. The COVID-19 is most probably diffused and transmitted by droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze, but more data are developing everyday (Figure 3). Understandably, the possibility of a pandemic is enough to cause serious panic. While avoiding exposure to anyone likely affected is an obvious precaution, there are practical ways you can protect yourself and allay your worries. According to the Consumer Health Information Centre (U.K), air travel and public transport give the best atmosphere for this SARS-CoV to spread. An airless atmosphere can cause human mucous membranes to become dry, which depresses the human protection against flu and colds, as does abrupt changes in body fever which reduce the body's immunity [19,20]. We also recognize that Coronaviruses are also spread by contact, transmitted through not only evident ways, such as osculating, but by sharing drink or food utensils, telephones, pens and pencils, computer mice and keyboards, door handles and taxi. Coronaviruses can survive on hands for some hours, so at times like this common hygiene suits extremely imperative. The eyes are similarly as receptive to invading viruses as is the nose. Therefore, people should constantly wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Also, used materials and tissues should be disposed of closely and kitchen benches, Figure 1 Coronavirus spread. Flights from deadly epicenter of Virus, Wuhan, could help byg reach other countries.

Currently, there is no vaccine for the new SARS-CoV-2. Scholars and researchers have already begun investigating on one, but creating and developing a vaccine that is active and nontoxic in human beings will take a long time. Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code. ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS AND ISOLATED COMPOUNDS Nowadays, there are about 37 licensed antiviral drugs on the market [22], but numerous illnesses produced by viruses are not curable; latency, viral resistance, and several frequent problems in treatment are also of concern [23]. The use of EOs in aromatherapy and phytomedicine is mostly due to their antiviral antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant effects which also is mirrored in the number of research articles published when the words \"antiviral\" (99,600 papers), \"antibacterial\" (746,000 articles), \"antifungal\" (160,000 articles), \"anti-Coronaviruses\" (11,800 papers), were used as searching criterion in google scholar website. The exploration and search for new and promising antiviral molecules or drugs should therefore be increased and all potential approaches should be organized and deployed [24,25]. New bio-active molecules can be screened to find novel antiviral agents, as is generally carried out for cancer drug discovery. Over 70% of the post genomically created medications and drugs have a natural origin or were motivated by natural product chemistry. Natural products and medicinal plants have usually delivered 25% to 40% of the present antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral or anticancer molecules for the pharmaceutical industry, but science has studied only a minor fraction of potentially useful herbs and plants in its efforts to design more bio-active molecules extracted from natural products [26]. The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly targeting medicinal plants with the aim of identifying lead compounds, focusing particularly on suitable alternative antiviral agents. In recent years there has been a growing attention in the use of medicinal plants and natural substances, and some queries regarding the security of synthetic molecules have motivated more detailed and comprehensive investigations of natural products and medicinal plants [27]. Aromatic herbs and medicinal plants produce a diversity of secondary metabolites and chemical compounds with the potential to inhibit viral replication and chemical molecules from natural products are of interest as possible and promising sources to inhibit viral replication and infection. These herbs and plants have usually been used to treat a range of non-infectious and infectious illnesses and are considered as a rich source of innovative bioactive secondary metabolites [28,29]. Thus herbs and medicinal plants continue to be a main source of new lead bio-active molecules. Besides minor compounds from medicinal chemistry, medicinal plants are still key sources of inventive beneficial agents for different diseases, comprising human infections [30]. For example, flavonoids, terpenes, polysaccharides, alkaloids, amino acids, phenols and essential oils (EOs) are among the plant-derived antiviral molecules that are being employed in phytomedicine, and these have been shown to prevent the replication of some viruses such as hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex and SARS [24,26,31,32]. EOs, volatile and odors products extracted from medicinal plants and aromatic herbs have extensive use and application in phytomedicine and aromatherapy as well as in pharmaceutical industries. EOs are complex natural mixtures of aromatic secondary metabolites, extracted from herbs and plants using different techniques (hydro- or steam-distillation, microwave or ultrasound extractions, cold pressing or solvent extraction) [33]. The major phytochemical compounds of EOs, for example, oxygenated and ketones, are responsible for the fragrance and pharmacological activities of medicinal plants and aromatic herbs. Different EOs and their characteristic compounds have several biological properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, wound- healing and anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo [34-36]. For many decades, results on the antiviral activities of EOs and their major chemical compounds lagged behind those for other germs and strains with respect to the range of EOs and viruses tested and description of the mechanisms of antiviral effect. This was revealed in the moderate few research articles and scientific publications covering the subject [37-39]. More recently, several investigations and reports have analyzed and described the in vitro activity of an extensive variety of EOs. The in vitro works have been done using the enveloped influenza or herpes simplex viruses 1 or 2 (HSV-1 component cinnamaldehyde [48], have been assessed against influenza viruses. EOs from anise ( Illicium verum have been described against HSV-1 and/or -2. Minami et al. [67], tested (tropical basil), M. piperita Toxicol 8(1): 4 Chemical structures of selected EO compounds [33,34]. Most of these EOs have been tested by measuring and calculating the inhibition of plaque formation in tissue cultures of appropriate host cells in vitro . Overall, the doses of EOs or major constituents that decreased plaque formation by 50% ranged from 0.000 06 to 1%. Often the doses of EOs that inhibit plaque formation are only slightly lower than the quantities that prove cytotoxic to the tissue-culture cells, resulting in a moderately low therapeutic index. However, attention on the potential application of EOs as antiviral drugs still persists, principally for topical use such as skin and hand antisepsis. Apart from the more extensively evaluated influenza virus and HSV, adenovirus and mumps virus [68], dengue virus type virus [69], poliovirus Immune-deficiency Virus (HIV) [70], Newcastle disease virus [43], tobacco mosaic virus [71], yellow fever virus [72], and the viral agent of SARS, a novel Coronavirus [73], have also been evaluated and determined against a range of EOs and chemical compounds. Otherwise, a chemical constituent of EOs that have an antiviral activity work like a disinfectant, and do not need replication to inhibit the virus [53,58]. Thus, resistance to virucidal compounds due to mutations generated in the viral genome during replication is unlikely [50]. The antiviral effect of EOs from botanicals has been published for a number of viruses, including dengue virus, herpes simplex virus, and Junin virus [50, 63, 74]. ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF ESSENTIAL OILS AGAINST CORONAVIRUSES Antiviral effect of a mixture of EOs and oleoresins from medicinal plants and aromatic herbs was evaluated in vivo and in vitro against Coronavir us infectious Treatment of avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), with the mixture decreased the virus titer in two host systems, Vero E6 cells and embryonating eggs. The effect of the mixture on IBV in chickens was also studied and revealed that the administration of EOs to chickens at a 1:20 dilution by spray, 2h before challenge with IBV was the most active cure. Also, current treatment reduced the severity of clinical lesions and signs in the birds, and decreased the quantity of viral RNA in the trachea. This study also revealed that the treatment with EOs protected chickens for up to 4 days post-treatment from clinical signs of disease (but not from infection) and decreased transmission of IBV over a 14-day period. Anti-IBV activity of the mixture was greater prior to virus attachment and entry indicating that the effect is virucidal. The effect appears to be more marked on cell free virus demonstrating that the effect is probably virucidal, which is significant because it may also be actual against other enveloped respiratory viruses, as well as other Coronaviruses in humans. In the study conducted by Wen et al. [76], 221 phytochemical compounds and EOs constituents were tested for antiviral effect against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using a cell-based assay diterpenoids, two sesquiterpenoids and two triterpenoids were potent inhibitors at concentrations between 3.3 and 10M. The concentrations of the 22 compounds to inhibit 50% of Vero E6 cell proliferation (CC50) and viral replication (EC50), were measured. These phytochemical constituents of EOs were revealed for the first time to display specific and significant anti- SARS CoV effect and thus offer a new way for improvement of anti-SARS-CoV drugs. The data are important because these types of compounds might also be useful to control other Coronaviruses like the SARS-CoV as well as other enveloped viruses like avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus. The effects of Nigella sativa , Anthemis hyalina and Citrus sinensis EOs on the replication of Coronavirus and the expression of TRP genes family was reported [77]. To evaluate the effect of extracts of extracts on the replication of coronavirus (CoV) and on the expression of TRP HeLa-CEACAM1a with MHV-A59 (mouse hepatitis virus-A59) was found to be the safe active dose. TCID50/ml (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose that will produce a cytopathic effect in 50 % of the inoculated tissue culture cells) was found for treatments to determine the viral loads. The inflammatory cytokine IL-8 level was found to increase for both 24 and 48 h time points following extract treatment. TRPA1, TRPC4, TRPM6, TRPM7, TRPM8 and TRPV4 were the genes which expression levels changed significantly after extract treatments. The virus load decreased when extracts were added to the CoV infected cells. All the extract treatments had an effect on IL-8 secretion, TRP gene expression and virus load after CoV infection and could be the best candidate in our hands that contains potential treatment molecule(s). MECHANISMS OF ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY With regard to the mechanism of antiviral action, in most cases where antiviral properties have been evaluated before and after host-cell adsorp tion, the antiviral action has happened mainly upon treatment of virus particles with EO prior to their addition or adsorption to cell monolayers. This recommends a direct effect of EO on free virus particles rather than an intracellular virucidal activity [57,58,60,67,74]. The site of action has not been known (Figure 5), but most of the viruses used and tested have been enveloped viruses, with the exception of poliovirus, adenovirus and tobacco mosaic virus. Viral envelopes are classically resulting from the membrane of the host cell and have a phospholipid bilayer structure. Since numerous EOs have the ability to interrupt biological membranes, it follows that viral envelopes may also be dislocated by EOs, an argument reinforced by electron micrographs of HSV- 1 after treatment with clove or oregano EOs presenting envelope interruption [78]. The antiviral effect of EOs, which are lipophilic by nature, likely act to disrupt or interfere with viral membrane proteins involved in host cell attachment [58]. Isoborneol, an oxygenated monoterpene and a chemical constituent of different EOs, displayed a potent antiviral effect against HSV-1 and exactly inhibited glycosylation of viral proteins [66]. Eugenol, a phenylpropane that represents more than 70% in clove EO, delayed the growth of herpesvirus-induced keratitis the mouse model [64], and inactivated HSV directly [65]. In opposition to the rising body of in vitro results, there are very limited studies of in vivo antiviral effect of EOs and their characteristic compounds. Nigella sativa (seed oil), was evaluated cinnamaldehyde [48], were tested against influenza in mouse models. Clinical investigations in humans are also very restricted. Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) EO has been tested for the treatment of herpes labialis in a small pilot research with encouraging findings, signifying a decrease in the time to complete healing with the application of Melaleuca alternifolia EO topical ointment compared to the positive control [240]. Thus different mechanisms of antiviral activity of different essential oils and compounds of essential oils seem to be present. De Logu et al. [60], reported an inhibition of herpesviruses replication and prevention of cell-to-cell spread by using Santolina insularis EO in vitro . However, no antiviral activity was reported throughout the intracellular replication step, which is in agreement to other EOs [46]. In addition, a virus without envelope (adenovirus), was not affected or deactivated by eucalyptus EO due to the nonexistence of a viral envelope [81]. Virucidal activity of essential oils, which are lipophilic by nature, is probably due to disruption of the viral membrane or interference with viral envelope proteins involved in host cell attachment. Although selection of resistant mutants is possible, it has been reported that inactivation of virus by lipophilic EOs is time dependent and that infectious virus remaining after treatment are still sensitive to the EOs making selection of resistant mutants unlikely [74].CentralNadjib (2020) 6/8 Figure 5 Targeting host proteins and several steps of the viral life cycle by current therapeutic and alternative natural products (in red).
