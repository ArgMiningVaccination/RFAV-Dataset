Methods: A descriptive survey design was developed. Fourteen countries participated in the study and data was collected through a descriptive questionnaire from 956 patients. Results: Data suggest that CAM is popular among cancer patients with 35.9% using some form of CAM (range among countries 14.8% to 73.1%). A heterogeneous group of 58 therapies were ident-ied as being used. Herbal medicines and remedies were the most commonly used CAM therapies,together with homeopathy, vitamins/minerals, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies and relaxation tech-niques. Herbal medicine use tripled from use before diagnosis to use since diagnosis with cancer.Multivariate analysis suggested that the prole of the CAM user was that of younger people, female and with higher educational level. The source of information was mainly from friends/family and the media, while physicians and nurses played a small part in providing CAM-related information.The majority used CAM to increase the body's ability to ght cancer or improve physical andemotional well-being, and many seemed to have beneted from using CAM (even though thebenets were not necessarily related to the initial reason for using CAM). Some 4.4% of patients,however, reported side-effects, mostly transient. Conclusions: It is imperative that health professionals explore the use of CAM with their cancer patients, educate them about potentially benecial therapies in light of the limited available evidenceof effectiveness, and work towards an integrated model of health-care provision. Key words: alternative medicine, complementary medicine, Europe, herbs, homeopathy, spiritual healing, vitamins Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been dened as 'any diagnosis, treatment or prevention that comp-lements mainstream medicine by contributing to a commonwhole, by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or bydiversifying the conceptual framework of medicine' [1, 2].The use of CAM has increased steadily over the past 15 years or so, and undoubtedly it has gained medical, economic and sociological importance [3]. However, little is known aboutthe use of CAM in cancer patients specically. This is especially true in the context of Europe, as the bulk of the literature comes from the USA. A survey conducted in 33 countries, yielding a meagre 83 responses mainly from oncologists, indicated the existence of a large and heterogeneous group of CAM therapies or remedies used to treat cancer in both developed and developing countries[4]. A literature review suggested that the use of CAM among *Correspondence to : Dr A. Molassiotis, University of Manchester, School of Nursing, Coupland February 2005 q2005 European Society for Medical Oncology brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by RERO DOC Digital Librarycancer patients is common, with a prevalence rate across studies of 31.4% (range 7% to 64%) [3]. The latter review included 26 surveys from 13 countries carried out from 1977 to January 1998. However, more recent studies suggest that theuse of CAM is considerably higher, with some studies report-ing rates of 70.2% in a sample of 356 colon, breast and prostatecancer patients [5], and 83.3% in an outpatient sample of 453patients [6]. Depending on the instrument used to collect thedata, the particular population under study, the sample size andthe CAM denition used, studies report rates from 37% to 87% [7-11]. In paediatric patients rates are equally high, ranging from 32.7% in the UK [12] to 84% in the USA [13]. The most popular therapies seem to be dietary treatments, herbalism, homeopathy, hypnotherapy and imagery/visualisa-tion [2]. Spiritual therapies, prayer as a therapy, massage, shark cartilage, green tea, support groups and non-traditional diets are also commonly reported in the literature [6, 9, 11,14, 15]. Improvements in physical and psychosocial well-being and increasing hope are the main reasons cancer patientsturn to CAM [11], although dissatisfaction with some aspectsof conventional health care, poor doctor-patient relationship,accessibility, perceived effectiveness and desperation may alsobe key motivating factors [16]. CAM includes a wide range of therapies. The National Cen- ter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the USAclassies CAM therapies into ve categories [17]: (i) alternative medical systems, such as traditional Chinese medicine or Ayurveda; (ii) mind-body interventions, such as meditation, prayer, healing or support groups; (iii) biologically based therapies, such as herbs, dietary sup- plements or vitamins; (iv) manipulation and body-based methods, such as massage, chiropractic or osteopathy; and (v) energy therapies (i.e. bioeld therapies such as Qi Gong and Reiki or bioelectromagnetic-based therapies such as mag-netic elds). The aim of the present study was to assess the use of complementary and alternative therapies across a number ofEuropean countries, using the same measurement tool andsame denition of CAM. Patients and methods Patients and settings A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to collect data through a questionnaire about CAM therapies. Eighteen National Oncol- ogy Nursing Societies, all members of the European Oncology Nursing Society, were approached for possible collaboration. Of the 18 societies,15 agreed to participate, although one withdrew later on. A key person from each society was selected, based on interest and/or experience in CAM. Each person had to translate the questionnaire into their own coun-try's language, apply to the ethics committee in each hospital involved in the study and collect the data. In certain countries the questionnaire had to be altered slightly, as some of the 25 ethics committees where thestudy was assessed requested changes (i.e. in Switzerland collecting data on income levels was not recommended to be included as a variable).Also, in most cases, researchers did not have access to patients' medical records. Data collected from each country were returned to one of the investigators and then data were coded for analysis. On many occasions,data had to be translated back to English, especially qualitative comments patients made on the questionnaire. Data were collected in the outpatient clinics of a number of hospitals over several random days. On the selected days, all patients attending a given clinic were approached for possible inclusion in the study. In mostcountries data were collected from more than one hospital, and in ve countries there were hospitals included from large cities as well as rural units. Both metastatic and non-metastatic cancer patients were includedfrom cancer centres, oncology units of general hospitals, day units, radio- therapy units and hospices. All participating patients received information about the study and in most countries those volunteering to participate signed a consent form. However, in a small number of countries (i.e. England) a written consentform was not necessary, and completing the questionnaire implied that patients volunteered for the study. Patients were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: they were adult patients of either gender witha diagnosis of cancer; aware of their diagnosis; able to understand the questions; free from any condition that would make completing the ques- tionnaire inappropriate or overburdening for the patients; and they werewilling to participate in the study. In several countries, especially the Mediterranean and Eastern European ones, data collection proved to be difcult, as a substantial number of patients did not meet one of the inclusion criteria, namely that of being aware of their diagnosis. Procedures The questionnaire was anonymous and was handed out to the patientsafter they received information about the study, agreed to participate and signed the consent form. Patients completed the questionnaire while they were waiting at the outpatient clinic to be seen by their physician orduring therapy. On completion, patients either put the questionnaire in a box or handed it to the local researcher. Owing to the multinational nature of the study, it was not possible to assess the number or characteristics ofthose declining to participate. The questionnaire The questionnaire used was based on the one developed by Swisher et al. [11]. However, the questionnaire was modied for the purposes of the pre- sent study and some new items were added (for example, personal spend-ing on CAM and frequency of CAM use) and some others were modiedto reflect European culture (for example, items on ethnic background and nancial status). There were 27 items in total. These included demo- graphic data (age, gender, occupation, education, household income, mari-tal status, number of people living in the household and ethnicity), clinical data (site of primary cancer, standard treatments received previously and current standard treatment) and questions about CAM use. If patients reported no past or current use of CAM after completing the sociodemographic and clinical section of the questionnaire, they wereasked to choose an answer from a list of possible reasons for not using CAM. After that, patients were thanked for their contribution and asked to stop completing the questionnaire at that stage. If patients reported past orcurrent use of CAM, they were asked to continue. The rest of the ques- tions asked were: .Which CAM therapy patients used before the diagnosis of cancer, since the diagnosis of cancer or currently. 'Since diagnosis' was dened asany time from the moment a diagnosis of cancer was made until thepresent time, and 'currently' was dened as actually using a CAM656therapy at the present time. This was done from a list of 26 possible therapies, with space to add other therapies if appropriate. Examples of therapies listed were spiritual therapies, herbs, animal extracts, osteopa-thy, chiropractic, mega-vitamins, aromatherapy, Qi Gong, acupuncture and others. .Types of CAM practitioners consulted before the diagnosis of cancer, since the diagnosis of cancer or currently. .Method of use of the reported therapy (i.e. by mouth, injection or enema). .Frequency of use of reported therapy. .Reasons for using CAM therapies. .Benets experienced by the use of CAM. .Ill effects or side-effects from using the reported CAM therapy. .Expenditure on CAM. .Satisfaction and perceived effectiveness (on a 0-7 scale with higher scores indicating higher levels of satisfaction or perceived effective- ness). .Sources of information about CAM therapies. Data analysis Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme. Descriptive statistics were calculated with all vari- ables to summarise the data. Differences in sociodemographic character-istics between CAM users and non-users were assessed using the x 2-test. Spearman correlation coefcients were also calculated between CAM use and other variables of interest. Finally, multivariate analysis was used toassess which variables predicted CAM use. Results Participating countries Fourteen countries completed the study, providing a total of 956 patient-completed questionnaires for evaluation. Table 1shows the countries and the number of questionnaires returned from each country. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample A total of 591 (61.8%) female and 365 (38.2%) male patients participated in the study. Their mean age was 55.68 years[range 17-91; standard deviation (SD) 12.78]. n= 703; 74%) were married. The vast majority (98.5%) were of white ethnic background. Most were earning<20 000 Euros annually (72.5%). Most ( n= 767; 82%) were currently receiving standard treatment. More details are shownin Table 2. Use of CAM Past or current CAM use was reported by 35.9% ( n= 342) of the total patient population. CAM use ranged from 14.8% to73.1% (see Table 1). Use of CAM ranged from 1 month up to18 years in some cases (mean 27 months). In most countries,around one-third of patients were using some form of CAM,with only Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy showinghigh levels of CAM use and Greece showing very low levelsof use (Table 1). It was interesting to see that CAM use was lower before the diagnosis of cancer, increased by at least 30% since diagnosis and current use stabilised at a little higher(8%) than the CAM use before diagnosis. Thirty-eight differ-ent therapies had been used before the diagnosis, 46 sincediagnosis (10 were new types never used before by thepatients) and 39 types of therapies were currently used. Intotal, 58 different CAM therapies were reported. Table 3shows the frequency of use of different CAM therapies before diagnosis, since diagnosis and currently. There were signicant differences in CAM use among the different cancer diagnostic groups of the sample. The highestprevalence rate of CAM use was in pancreatic, liver, bone/ spinal and brain cancer patients, followed by breast, stomach, gynaecological and genitourinary cancers. The lowest rates ofCAM use were observed in lung and head and neck cancerpatients (Table 4). Patients who paid for CAM privately were also asked to report how much, on average, they spent on such therapies or remedies. Patients were spending an average of e123/month, and the maximum reported amount was e4140/month. How- ever, less than half the patients using CAM actually paid forsuch therapies or remedies ( n= 188/342), as most of the reme- dies used were easily available without a charge (i.e. by col-lecting herbs themselves or by relatives collecting herbs fromthe mountain or given by friends). The ve most frequently used broad categories of therapies were similar across most countries. Herbs were the most com-monly used CAM therapy in 13 out of 14 countries and theywere the number one CAM therapy in nine countries (Turkey, Israel, Serbia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland,Table 1.

Homeopathy was the most commonly used CAM therapy in Belgium and in the top ve in six other countries(Turkey, Czech Republic, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Greece). Medicinal teas were also in the list of the ve most frequently used CAM therapies (seven countries), as were vitamins/mine-rals (nine countries). Most herbs were specic to each country(i.e. mistletoe in Switzerland, olive leaf paste in Greece, nettle leaves/tea in Turkey, aloe vera in Serbia and Spain or Ovosan in the Czech Republic). Israel, Denmark, Italy, Spain,Greece and Iceland featured strongly in relation to spiritual therapies. The types of herbs or biological ingestibles used by partici- pants were also assessed, as we asked participants to write down the names of herbs/remedies used. Herbs and other bio- logical ingestibles used included green tea, essiac tincture,Chinese herbs, sage tablets, Echinacea, cod liver oil, fresh juice and vegetables, vitamin E, glucosamine, chamomile, peppermint, selenium, mistletoe/Iscador, yeast extract, multi-vitamins, Ayurveda herbs, vitamin C, dry thyme,dry nettle, nettle tea, nettle or nettle seeds mixed with honey, ginseng, mulberry molasses, shark cartilage, sh oil, gingko biloba, milk thistle, minerals (i.e. Zn, Ca, Mg), aloe vera(orally and externally used), papaya tea, beet and carrot juice, paste from olive leaves, a mixture of aloe-honey-rhaki and wine, and angelica herb. Most herbs were used to treat thecancer, although no participant specied for which speciccondition they were using which method.Table 2.

Themean satisfaction score was 5.27 (SD 1.52), where a score of7 indicated the most satised. Similarly, the mean score for perceived effectiveness was 5.04 (SD 1.52).Frequency of use Thirty-three different types of CAM practitioners were con- sulted. Seven patients (6.3%) received CAM therapy throughtheir general practitioner/family doctor. Most patients who were visiting a CAM practitioner ( n= 111) did so less than once a month (34.2%), once a week (24.3%) or once a month(22.5%). Some 8.1% of patients visited a CAM practitioneronce a month and 8.1% of patients visited a CAM practitioner2-3 times a week. Furthermore, 2.7% visited a practitioneralmost daily. Reasons for using CAM and perceived benets from its use Most patients were using CAM as they wanted to increase their body's ability to ght the disease (50.7%), improve physical well-being (40.6%) or improve emotional well-being(35.2%) (Table 5). However, there were some differences inthe reasons for using CAM therapies and the experiencedbenet from them. In more detail, although the primary reasonstated for using CAM was to increase the ability to ghtthe cancer, only 22.4% found CAM of benet ( P<0.001). Additionally, it is interesting to note that 42.5% found CAM to be helpful in improving emotional well-being, although this was only identied as a reason for use in 35.3% of the sample(P<0.01). Only 31 patients (3.2%) found the CAM thera- py/therapies they used were not of benet at all. Sources of information about CAM Patients were asked to note where they had learnt about theCAM therapy they used/were using. Friends were the mostcommon source of information (56.5%), followed by family (29.1%) and the media (28.4%). Other sources of informationTable 3.

Side-effects Fourteen patients (4.4%) reported side-effects from the CAMtherapy they had used. Most seemed to be transient side-effects and they were all related to ingesting herbs or minerals. Responses were obtained from seven countries.These side-effects included stomach aches (one incident withthyme and nettle tea, one with vitamin C, and one with aloe);gastric upset and nausea from using nettle tea (one report);itching [one incident with nettle leaves, one with seleniumtablets and Iscador (mistletoe)]; herbs); and poor renal status/accumula- tion of body acid (one incident with vitamin C). Multivariate analysis Spearman correlation coefcients showed that the use ofCAM was associated with younger age ( 0.12; P<0.001), although these correlations were weak. These were also the variables that differed signicantly between the usersand non-users of CAM ( x 2-tests). Additionally, occupation was also different between users and non-users ( P= 0.008). A multivariate model of sociodemographic and clinical charac-teristics showed that three variables were the strongest predic-tors of CAM use: younger age, female gender and highereducational level ( P<0.001). However, the model could only explain 26% of the variance in the use of CAM.Why patients do not use CAM Patients who were not using CAM were asked to note why they did not do so. The majority ( n= 236; 43.4%) reported that they were happy with the conventional treatment theyreceived/were receiving. Also, 34.7% ( n= 189) reported that they never thought of CAM and 15.1% ( n= 82) that they did not believe in CAM. Other reasons included discouragementfrom family ( n= 12; 2.2%), lack of information about CAM (n= inability to pay for CAM ( n= 9; 1.7%). Five patients (0.9%) noted that they were interested in CAM butthey had not decided to use any as yet. Discussion The current study constitutes one of the largest surveys to dateon the use of CAM in cancer patients, and is the onlyEuropean-wide survey available. As such, it provides initialevidence of the extent of the use of CAM therapies, types,reasons behind use or non-use, perceived benets, expendi-ture, and commonly observed side-effects. It has shown thatalthough Europe consists of a diverse cultural population,CAM use has more similarities than differences acrossEurope. It is shown that the most popular CAM therapy in cancer patients is the use of medicinal herbs or remedies, although the variety of herbs used differed by country. More than one-third (35.9%) of the cancer patients reported using some form of CAM, with little variation acrosscountries. This is an increase of the average mean CAM usefrom that reported in a review of 29 studies covering 20 years[3]. Similar to the study by Ernst and Cassileth [3], there wasgreat variability in the use of CAM, and this may partly be the result of the patient's understanding of what CAM is. A stan- dardised protocol was used in the current study to minimisesuch biases, and the denition used was as broad and inclusiveas possible. The variability probably also reflects adjunctiveuse of CAM, as the sample was derived exclusively fromhealth-care settings. Nevertheless, CAM use is considerably lower in the present study than surveys reporting results from US samples. US studies demonstrate a much higher use of CAM, which is often well above 40% [6, 8, 9, 15]. This could indicate thatthe concept of a more holistic approach to medicine or the useof an integrated model of health-care provision is lagging inEurope compared with the USA. North Americans may alsobe using CAM more frequently due to the wider influence thatethnic groups may have had on Western (scientic) medicalphilosophy, and the realisation that some of the CAM thera-pies may be benecial to patients and possibly cost-effective.Furthermore, Kessler et al. [18] also suggest that the trend inthe use of CAM in the USA may be a result of a secular trendthat began about half a century ago, which nevertheless high-lights the increasing patient demand for such therapies. How-ever, the limited available data on the effectiveness of variousCAM therapies also highlights the necessity to be selective and careful (but open minded) about CAM therapies.Table 5.

An observation of the study was that par-ticipants from palliative care facilities tended to use CAM more often, but the mixed settings in most of the countries participating in the study did not allow us to validate thisobservation. Furthermore, another observation was that CAMuse was higher in cities, but when samples from rural hospitalswithin the same country were added, it decreased the overall number of users. This was especially true in Greece and Spain, where such data were available. Hence, use of CAMtherapies may also be related to the availability of such thera-pies in a given geographical setting. The lowest frequency ofCAM use was observed in Greece, and this may reflect the lack of availability of many CAM therapies, high compliance with conventional medical treatments, cultural norms or con-cealing use of CAM in order to avoid any conflict of opinionwith the health-care team. Indeed, before completing the studyquestionnaire, many participants from a number of countries in the study did mention that they did not want their health- care team to know about their use of CAM. A large number ( n= 58) of heterogeneous CAM therapies was reported. Conrming earlier reports, herbals and medi- cinal teas, vitamins and minerals, spiritual therapies, homeo- pathy, and relaxation techniques were the CAM therapies usedmore often in this current sample [7-11]. These did not differsubstantially among all the countries involved in the study.Perhaps reflecting cultural preferences, availability and national legislation from country to country, differences were observed in the less frequently used CAM therapies. Based onthe CAM classication by the National Center for Comp-lementary and Alternative Medicine [17], most patients wereusing biologically based therapies. This highlights the attrac- tiveness for patients of 'natural' therapies and remedies, but also suggests that patients may be at risk of side-effects or, asmost patients were currently receiving treatment, interactionswith conventional medicines. Several good reviews of such side-effects have been presented in the literature (e.g. Niggemann and Gruber [19]). The role of CAM in affecting(positively or negatively) the outcomes of pharmaceuticalclinical trials in cancer care is also an issue that needs atten-tion, as many patients involved in trials will also be using CAM therapies. Patients typically used more than one CAM therapy together. This fact alone makes research into the effectivenessof CAM using traditional trial designs complicated. It was also interesting to see that only a small number of patients used support groups. This was 0.3% before the diagnosis ofcancer (reflecting presence of other chronic conditions),increasing to 1.8% at some point since the diagnosis of cancerand only 1.4% using support groups currently. This is con- siderably lower than rates reported in past psychosocial litera- ture [20, 21], perhaps highlighting the lack of availability ofsupport groups in many countries in Europe. However, pastresearch on support groups comes mainly from America, withdata commonly collected from breast cancer patients andspecialist clinics, so the higher rates reported may not be gen- eralisable to all cancer patients. Further, as can be seen inTable 3, the overall use of energy therapies (often used for 'wellness' rather than specic illnesses) and manipulative methods were decreased after the diagnosis of cancer (withthe exception of electromagnetic therapy and massage). Herbal medicines were by far the most commonly used therapy, escalating in use from 5.3% before the diagnosis ofcancer to 13.9% (an almost three-fold increase) after the diag-nosis of cancer. A wide range of herbs were recorded as beingused. These differed from country to country, probably based on specic ethnopharmacological information and tradition, as well as availability. For example, among others, Turkeyreported most commonly the use of nettle leaves/teas, as wellas thyme, often mixed with other compounds; Scotlandreported more often the use of green tea; Switzerland usedmistletoe more often (a particularly popular herb in German-speaking countries); the Czech Republic used Ovosan (alocally produced tablet number of herbs),selenium, ginseng, biloba and Echinacea; Swedenreported of blood salts and ginseng; Serbia and Spainreported more often the use of aloe vera; Greece reported theuse of a paste made from olive leaves; Iceland reported theuse of lupine extracts (angelica) and green tea; and Israel andEngland reported the use of multivitamins. It was interesting to see the wide variation in the prevalence rates of CAM use among different diagnostic groups. Despitesuggestions from the literature that breast cancer patients aremore likely to use CAM compared with other cancer patients[22], the present study showed that pancreatic, liver, bone andbrain cancer patients used CAM therapies signicantly moreoften than any other cancer patient group. All four of these diagnostic categories are characterised by poor prognosis and a rapid physical decline, often with metastasis present, andsuch patients may have little hope from conventional treat-ments, turning to CAM as an additional intervention toimprove their lives. The role of CAM not only in increasinghope and optimism, but also in improving quality of life andmanaging symptoms, especially in terminal illness, may beimportant, but relevant data in cancer patients is almost non-existent to date. However, some of the results in this subgroupanalysis should be viewed with caution, as only a small num-ber of patients participated from some of the diagnostic cat-egories. Also, a longitudinal design could have given moreaccurate information about variation of CAM use along thepatient's disease experience. Patients seem to be satised with the use of CAM, even if they do not see any obvious benet from it. A wide range ofreasons contribute to the use of CAM, and perhaps the conceptof 'hope' is fundamental in each one of these reasons. Morethan two-thirds of the patients used CAM therapies to directlyght the cancer or to increase the body's ability to ght can-cer, but eventually they found little benet for this. However,those who used CAM to improve physical and emotional well-being seemed to have beneted from CAM. These nd- ings coincide with ndings from the USA [11]. It is interesting661to see that <1% of the patients used CAM following the rec- ommendation of their physician, perhaps reflecting the disap-proval of CAM therapies by the medical community or thelack of information to the medical community about available and effective CAM therapies. Examples of such information include the consistently positive results with acupuncture inthe management of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting[23]; the positive effects of self-hypnosis, massage or acu-puncture in pain relief in cancer patients [24]; the relief of dyspnoea with acupuncture, acupressure or relaxation/breath- ing techniques [24]; the positive short-term benets of mas-sage and aromatherapy massage on psychological well-being[25]; and the promising results from the use of mistletoe inrelation to survival, management of side-effects or quality of life in cancer patients [26]. Also, <4% used CAM to directly ght the disease (i.e. as an alternative cancer treatment) andthe overwhelming majority used CAM to complement theircancer treatment or help them cope with the treatment and/orits side-effects. As many of the therapies used are 'comp- lementary' in nature (such as aromatherapy, massage, relax- ation, reflexology and others), we may not need to prove theireffectiveness before using them, as patients are demandingsuch therapies, they are low-risk therapies and patients feelgood after their use. Such therapies may have a great role to play, especially in the palliative care setting, where the goal is not cure but rather improvement in quality of life. Patient sat-isfaction can be an appropriate end point outcome for evalu-ation rather than clinical outcome studies in this setting. A wide variety of sources of information were used before patients selected a given therapy. Friends and family or wordof mouth seemed to be the most important sources of infor-mation. This may be problematic, as what is effective for onepatient may not be for another, even with the same symptoms. Also, the media was shown to be a common source of infor- mation, and this may again be problematic, as the media oftensensationalises patient stories without balancing the infor-mation presented. The role of physicians as sources of infor- mation was quite low, with only 18.6% actually providing information to patients. This number is even lower amongnurses: only 3% of nurses were identied as the main sourceof information for patients. Health professionals need to beable to provide information about CAM to their patients, although the knowledge decit is acknowledged. The Internet is another commonly used source of information, but thecommercial nature of many relevant websites (especially inrelation to herbs) and the lack of quality assessment of theinformation posted on the web may be sources of misinforma- tion [27]. Findings should be evaluated in light of the limitations of the study. The European-wide nature of the study was difcultto conduct, and it was difcult to maintain consistency, because of its international breadth and specic requests from various ethics committees or hospital boards. As we did nothave access to medical records, we could not ascertainwhether there was metastatic disease or not and other, moresensitive clinical data. There is also an overlap between theusers of CAM 'since diagnosis' and 'currently'. Based on the selected design of the study, made simple and anonymous to full recruitment criteria in all the countries involved, it was difcult to track patients who refused participation (albeitrecruitment rates of >90% were achieved in the majority ofthe cases, based on individual researchers' comments).Finally, as the samples were taken from different settings, pat-terns of use may reflect different rates because of the settingrather than the countries concerned. Irrespective of what health professionals believe about CAM and how dismissive of CAM they may be, it is evidentthat patients are using, and will continue to use, CAM thera-pies. Hence, from a professional point of view, health-carestaff need to be aware of such use of CAM and to be able toeducate patients appropriately. This will probably necessitate the rethinking of the provision of medical and health-care edu- cation, broaden our understanding of the concept of medicineand help us work towards integrating into mainstream health-care services those CAM therapies for which evidence ofeffectiveness exists. This debate has already been discussedelsewhere (i.e. Owen et al. [28]). At the same time, there willbe a need for considerable increase in the funding for CAMresearch. Currently only the National Center for Complemen- tary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health in the USA provides substantial funds for such research, andother organisations and countries would need to follow theirexample. In the UK, research funding for CAM has increasedover the years but, until recently, this was still only /C240.31% of all funding available for medical research, suggesting thatfunding is low [29]. The need to increase the evidence base ofCAM therapies, using methodologies that are appropriate and sensitive to CAM, cannot be overemphasised. This is also important from an economic point of view, as the use ofCAM is a multibillion Euro business, and as shown in thisstudy, some patients pay large sums out of their pockets toreceive such interventions. In the USA, where such data areavailable, the use of CAM is conservatively estimated to costpatients US$27 billion (for the year 1997) [30]. In Europe it isthe second biggest growth industry [31]. Finally, appropriate legislation and regulation of CAM therapies in Europe is also necessary. While many countries have developed their ownregulation and legislation [32], there are wide variations insuch laws across Europe. Since it would appear that CAM ishere to stay, the European Community needs to considerbroader policies, common laws and a rationalisation of theavailable legislation.
