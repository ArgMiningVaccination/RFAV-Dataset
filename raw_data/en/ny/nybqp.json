I am an Ayurvedic Naturopath. What that means is that I am a western Naturopath, and an Ayurvedic Practitioner. I incorporated these two similar systems in my practice, to come up with a modern version of an ancient science. It is my lifelong purpose to assist others to realize that they are Spiritual Beings having a human experience. When our \"come from\" changes from the old model of \"being human, having an occasional spiritual experience\".... if we are lucky, it changes everything. Then what seems to be insurmountable, becomes another opportunity to become more of our birthright, as we infuse our potential into the current situation so that the Truth can set us free. Every client's challenge allows me the opportunity to break through the illusion that they may walk in with, and help them restore the memory of perfect health. I use very subtle and very gross matter, and everything in between to achieve this. HAVE YOU ALWAYS KNOWN YOU WOULD BE A HEALER? IS THIS YOUR FIRST CAREER? Ever since I was in my teens I have been attuned to Yoga Philosophy, and meditation. I was always interested in diet, beginning with raw, foods, the Natural Hygiene system, Jethro Kloss's Herbal Book, Adelle Davis, Bernard Jenson, Victorius Kulvinski, and Richard Hittlemans' Yoga on PBS! When I started attending Self-Realization Fellowship at 21 I was pretty sure this was my path. Prior to that, I was interested in child development and education. IN SIMPLE TERMS, WHAT IS AYURVEDA? Ayurveda is the East Indian medical system. It is based on the Five Element principle, and using body typing, it address the vast array of symptoms that occur in each type when a specific element is elevated or reduced. Diet, herbal medicine, Dinacharya, or daily routine, seasonal and time cycles all assist us in finding our way back to our true Self, which we call Prakruti.....which coincidently is the name of the Divine Feminine principle. Once I learned this, I knew I had struck gold! WHY IS THIS ANCIENT MEDICAL SYSTEM STILL RELEVANT TODAY? Ayur=Life / Veda =Knowledge. Life never ends, and knowledge is ever-expanding. Ayurveda is like an umbrella to all healing arts and sciences, yet most technologies and systems don't realize their own heritage. Ayurveda is possibly the oldest health system on the planet, and as it evolved it morphed into other systems such as Chinese Medicine and Allopathy. Plastic surgery actually recognizes their roots in Ayurveda! WHO IS VASANT LAD AND WHY IS HE IMPORTANT? My teacher, Vasant Lad, is the foremost authority in Ayurveda. Although there are many good, qualified Ayurvedic Doctors in India and now the West, he was the first person to bring Ayurveda to the US in the late 70's. Because of this, it created a resurgence of Ayurveda in the East, as with the rise of Western medicine most of the wealthy in India had started to turn to modern Allopathy after the British rule. If you would like more info on Dr Lad, you can check out his website [Ayurveda.com](http://www.ayurveda.com/). There is also a film that came out in 2018 called \"The Doctor from India\", which follows him through India and touches on his beautiful work. ARE THERE ANY NEWCOMERS WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT? There are some amazing new Ayurvedic Doctors on the scene now. Most people know of Deepak Chopra, who started his Ayurvedic career the same year as I did. He has expanded into Mind/Body Medicine, given Ayurveda's emphasis on a more holistic approach to healing. Dr. John Douillard, who is a sports doctor gone Ayurveda, and has a wonderful practice in Colorado, along with the last Vidya Mishra who was in Chatsworth, CA. Many others, such as the brilliant Vamadev Shastri, (David Frawley) who is the first America awarded the title of a Vaidya (scholar) in India. He has written a large number of books on the subject along with Jyotish (Vedic Astrology) and Mahavidya wisdom. HOW DID YOU DISCOVER AYURVEDA AND HOW HAS IT CHANGED YOUR LIFE? In my early adult years, at 22, I had a deeply spiritual experience that changed the course of my entire life. I was pregnant and attending a service at my Yoga Center at the time. They covered many deep topics in the Sunday services, other than asana. So, on that particular Mother's Day event the service was about mothering and motherhood. It dredged up some very painful childhood experiences, around the loss of my own mother at age 11. This lead me to cry out to the Divine Mother, who was recognized at this center, causing a vision of a Hindu Goddess to speak to me in a vision, and I had an immediate transformation of pain into being infused with a deep knowing of unconditional love and grace. Once that occurred, I vowed to find out who and what this Feminine Principled energy was, which lead me to my teacher, Vasant Lad. It was through a dear friend in Santa Cruz, who gave me doctor Lad's first book \"Ayurveda: The Science of Self-Healing\" that opened me up to this system. At the back of the book was a phone number, so when I picked up my landline and called it, Dr Lad picked up his own home phone and graciously gave me about two hours of his time. I was breastfeeding at the time, so when he invited me to study at his new institute in Albuquerque, I said it wasn't possible. He suggested Santa Cruz, where his offered a 6-week summer program. That still wouldn't work with my baby, so I boldly invited him to teach in Laguna Beach, which is eagerly accepted. This began a very intimate 8 years of working with him on events and consultations that I organized here in Laguna. HOW HAS AYURVEDA CHANGED YOUR PATIENT'S LIVES? Ayurveda has assisted my client's (we don't have the luxury of calling them patients! (and they don't need to be patient), since this system corrects the problem swiftly. They just need to employ the science and someone like myself to guide them through their unraveling. YOU LOOK AMAZING. WHAT DO YOU DO TO MAINTAIN YOUR HEALTH AND BEAUTY? WHICH HEALTH & BEAUTY PRODUCTS CAN YOU NOT LIVE WITHOUT? Thank you, Brenda! At 64, I feel amazing. There are so many beauty products on the market, but using something the is totally natural, like ayurvedic abhyanga oil on my body and face, and then taking a warm shower, begins my daily beauty regime. I am a long time promoter of Dr. Hauschka skin care. I start with their facial toner, then follow it with a beautiful non-Hauschka Vit C serum. After that I go back to my Hauschka daily Rejuvenation cream with a bit their earth mineral tint for color. It gives me a beautiful glow and has natural sunscreen protection. At night I cleanse with Hauschka's Cleansing Milk and my latest favorite night serum, NOX. It is a combination of Hemp oil, and Nitric Oxide which has really taken my skin to the next level!! I didn't think at my age I could improve on my already healthy looking skin, but this has blown even me away! Our listeners can email me to find out how to order. WHAT ARE SOME THINGS A PERSON SHOULD DO DAILY TO STAY HEALTHY? Dinacharya, or daily routine is the foundation of an ayurvedic program. If a person can wake up, and immediately scrape their tongue, and then brush their teeth, this will stimulate peristalsis of the bowels. Then a cup of warm water, either plain or with lemon or lime, depending on your dosha, or body type, you begin to stoke the digestive fire. An abhyanga, or self-oil massage, including the ears, and Nasya, oil in the nostrils helps to protect the inside and outside of the body from foreign invasion... which is crucial during this CO-VID 19 pandemic. BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT HEALTH AND AGING? That the older we get the sicker we get. THIS IS NOT TRUE! The skin regenerates itself every 6 days. The stomach lining every 2 months. The bones every 7 years, which is the oldest tissue in our body. We are never older than 7 years inside our body! We believe we age, and so it is. We put our faith in genetics, which may be our pre-dispositions, but Ayurveda says that only a small percentage of our health is affected by them. Lifestyle is the number one cause of good or bad health. RIGHT NOW, MORE THAN EVER (WITH COVID-19), PEOPLE ARE SCARED AND FEARFUL ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHAT CAN WE DO TO STAY SAFE? Again, Nasya oil in the nostrils helps to protect the inside and outside of the body from foreign invasion. A person with a Kapha imbalance or constitution, (high water and/or earth elements), can use a Neti pot to cleanse the sinus cavity. A Neti pot can be a life saver for keeping bacteria, viruses and mold out of the body. Then the Nasya oil can be dropped into each nostril, to protect the mucous membranes, collecting in foreign material from entering the lungs and sinuses. Also taking Triphala, which is a blend of 3 herbs, keeps the digestive system clean, so the body is not storing undigested food in the tissue causing toxicity, which is a breading ground for microbial infestation. Our bodies are a temple and as the pujari (temple priest) we must show our devotion to the Mother (all of Creation, ie Mother Earth, Mother Nature which we are part of) by keeping it Holy (wholy). There is some concern about the over washing of hands. It is important at this time to do with herbal, oil based soap and hot water, but we mustn't over cleanse to the point of disrupting the microbiome on the skin. This is there to protect us, just like gut microbiome protect our insides from disease producing bacteria, viruses, etc. IS THERE A LESSON IN THIS SITUATION THAT WE MAY BE MISSING (QUARANTINE BECAUSE OF COVID-19? The Great Mother is reclaiming dominion over Her realms of Nature through the agency of this virus. We cannot expect to dishonor Her without repercussions. She has been more than patient with us. Once the year 2000 arrived, we move from a singular, masculine model, to the collective, feminine reality. As She gains a foothold in the world through all of us, She restores Her balance, just as Nature does. When man disrupts Natural Law, karma will eventually be the effective means of restoration. With the installation of 5G Technology, which by the way is being implemented into our children's school while we are all locked away and hopefully not looking. This is a crime against not only Humanity, but Nature and all Her Creatures. We must either support Her, or we will call in Her Wrathful side to learn! CAN AYURVEDA BE BLENDED WITH OTHER MEDICAL SYSTEMS? Absolutely! As I said earlier, Ayurveda is the Mother of all healing, therefore She supports all systems, even if they don't recognize their Mother as their ally. DO YOU EVER GET FEARFUL? WHAT HELPS YOU THROUGH THAT EMOTION? Of course, I do get fearful. But that is when I ask myself, \"what would the Mother do in this situation?\" And what I almost always come up with is exactly what is happening. We either believe this is a benevolent universe, or not. We are conscious beings who forgot, so just by remembering, again and again, we can restore peace. Right association is 90% of the spiritual path according to Paramahansa Yogananda, the founder of Self-Realization fellowship and author of the classic book \"Autobiography of a Yogi\". If we are associating with negative people, listening to fear inducing news, trusting self-interested politicians, what else would we expect? We must give over our authority to Nature, as She is the author of our existence. It's so simple we overlook it. I have a consistent Yoga practice, I honor my body as a Temple for the Divine to embody, which invites truth into my heart. Meditation and chanting bhajans, along with deep contemplation on Sankhya Philosophy and occasional plant medicine journeys keep me connect to my Source. CAN YOU SUGGEST A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO CALM DOWN AND CENTER THEMSELVES? Breathe. While doing asana, breathe with each movement. While typing a post on Facebook, breathe. While using the toilet, breathe. While washing the dishes breathe. Each inhalation invites in spirit, each exhalation removes anything unlike love. I constantly remind myself to \"Go within, or go without\", therefore I am not very outwardly social but instead I spend my time in communion. It has the highest return!!
