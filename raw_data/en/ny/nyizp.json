Medical and legal experts say the narrow wording and circumstances probably make the case an exception - not a precedent - for thousands of other pending claims. The government \"has not conceded that vaccines cause autism,\" said Linda Renzi, the attorney representing federal officials, who have consistently maintained that childhood shots are safe. However, parents and advocates for autistic children see the case as a victory that may help certain others. Although the science on this is limited, the girl's disorder may be more common in autistic children than in healthy ones. \"It's a beginning,\" said Kevin Conway, a Boston attorney representing at least 1,200 families with vaccine injury claims. \"Each case is going to have to be proved on its individual merits. But it shows to me that the government has conceded that it's biologically plausible for a vaccine to cause these injuries. They've never done it before.\" An attorney for the 9-year-old girl has scheduled a news conference in Atlanta today. Her parents have declined to comment in the meantime because the case is not final and the payment amount has not been set. Nearly 5,000 families are seeking compensation for autism or other developmental disabilities they blame on vaccines and a mercury-based preservative, thimerosal. It once was commonly used to prevent bacterial contamination but since 2001 has been used only in certain flu shots. Some cases contend that the cumulative effect of many shots given at once may have caused injuries. The cases are heard by a special \"vaccine court\" that doles out cash from a fund Congress set up to pay people injured by vaccines and to protect makers from damages as a way to help ensure an adequate vaccine supply. The burden of proof is lighter than in a traditional court, and is based on a preponderance of evidence. Since the fund started in 1988, it has paid about 950 claims - none for autism. Studies repeatedly have discounted any link between thimerosal and autism, but legal challenges continue. The girl has a disorder involving her mitochondria, the energy factories of cells. The disorder - which can be present at birth from an inherited gene or acquired later in life - impairs cells' ability to use nutrients, and often causes problems in brain functioning. It can lead to delays in walking and talking. Federal officials say the law bars them from discussing the case or releasing documents without the family's permission. However, the Associated Press obtained a copy of the concession by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials. According to the document, five vaccines the girl received on one day in 2000 aggravated her mitochondrial condition, predisposing her to metabolic problems that manifested as worsening brain function \"with features of autism spectrum disorder.\" In the 1990s, the definition of autism was expanded to take in a group of milder, related conditions, which are known as autism spectrum disorders. The document does not address whether it was the thimerosal - or something else in the vaccines - that was at fault. Reported cases of autism have been rising in the United States, even after thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines. However, some experts believe the rise is because of an expansion of the definition of autism and related conditions, and a desire to diagnose children so they qualify for special services and aid. "}
