In a world inundated with artificial fragrances and synthetic products, the desire for clean, natural alternatives has never been stronger. One such simple swap is choosing [non-toxic candles](https://www.slownorth.com/collections/candles). In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore what non-toxic candles are, why they matter, and how they differ from conventional candles. Let's begin on this journey together, one beautiful, fragrant flame at a time. Section 1: What Are Non-Toxic Candles? Non-toxic candles are candles made without harmful or synthetic chemicals. They are typically crafted from natural waxes like soy, coconut or beeswax, scented with pure essential oils, and feature wicks made from natural fibers like cotton or wood. Here's a closer look at the primary components: - Wax: Traditional candles often use paraffin wax, a byproduct of [petroleum refining](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28465192/). Non-toxic candles, like Slow North's, favor natural alternatives such as soy wax, which burns cleaner and comes from renewable, American-grown sources. - Scent: Authentic essential oils provide the fragrance in non-toxic candles, offering genuine, delightful aromas without synthetic perfumes or chemical additives. - Wick: Many mass-produced commercial candles use wicks containing metal cores to help them stand up straighter, which can release harmful compounds into the air you breathe. [Non-toxic candles](https://www.slownorth.com/collections/candles)are only made with wicks made of natural fibers, and coated with vegetable wax - ensuring a safe, clean burn. Comparison with Traditional Candles [Non-toxic candles](https://www.slownorth.com/collections/candles) prioritize health, well-being, and environmental stewardship. They symbolize a departure from the artificial chemical-laden products that have become all too common in modern living spaces. Here's a simple comparison table 2: Why Choose Non-Toxic Candles? Health Benefits Breathing in synthetic fragrances from regular candles can lead to a host of health concerns, including headaches, respiratory issues, and even hormone disruptions. Non-toxic candles, scented with pure essential oils, provide a healthier option that supports well-being. Environmental Impact [Natural candles](https://www.slownorth.com/collections/candles) are not just better for you\u2014they're better for the Earth. Sustainable practices guide the sourcing of ingredients like American-grown soy wax, ensuring a lower environmental footprint as a renewable resource. From Slow North's commitment to reusable and recyclable packaging to the biodegradable nature of the products themselves, choosing non-toxic candles aligns with a greener lifestyle. Psychological and Emotional Well-being Lighting a candle is often associated with relaxation, meditation, and [mindfulness](https://www.slownorth.com/blogs/journal/3-ways-to-improve-your-mental-health-by-embracing-slow-living). By selecting [non-toxic candles](https://www.slownorth.com/collections/candles), you enhance this experience with authentic scents that can evoke positive emotions, promote relaxation, and contribute to a holistic approach to self-care through aromatherapy. Section 3: How to Choose the Best Non-Toxic Candles Identify the Ingredients Look for candles that explicitly list their ingredients. Natural waxes, pure essential oils, and natural fiber wicks are key. Transparency in labeling reflects a brand's commitment to providing safe and natural products, just like Slow North's approach.

Many individual essential oils have also been extensively studied; lavender, for example, has numerous beneficial properties, including pain relief, [stress relief](https://www.slownorth.com/blogs/journal/your-ultimate-guide-to-natural-stress-relief), and [help with sleep](https://www.slownorth.com/blogs/journal/night-affirmations-positivity-for-sleep-and-sweet-dreams). Essential oils are also completely safe to burn in candle form. Why Essential Oils Make Sense for the Health-Conscious Consumer The benefits of essential oils extend beyond their pleasant aroma. When used in candles, they provide a non-toxic alternative that aligns with a lifestyle focused on wellness. Unlike artificial fragrances, which may contain harmful chemicals, essential oils offer a clean, therapeutic experience. Whether you're embracing yoga, mindfulness, or simply seeking a healthier home environment, essential oil candles align with your values.

Section 7: Non-Toxic Candles for Allergies and Sensitivities The Issue with Traditional Candles For those with allergies or sensitivities to fragrances, traditional candles can be a hidden source of discomfort. Synthetic fragrances and certain waxes may release airborne irritants, leading to headaches, nasal congestion, or other allergic reactions. Non-Toxic Alternatives for Sensitive Individuals Slow North's non-toxic candles offer a wonderful solution. By using essential oils and natural ingredients, we minimize the risk of allergic reactions. \"Fragrance\" can include any number of chemicals and compounds, many of which can be known endocrine disruptors like phthalates or parabens, or even volatile organic compounds ( [VOCs](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/cheatsheet-volatile-organic-compounds)). In addition to being toxic, synthetic fragrances can also cause headaches. Our candles are crafted with care, making them suitable even for those with sensitivities. Making the Right Choice When selecting candles for sensitive individuals, consider the following: - Wax Type: Soy, beeswax, or other natural waxes are preferred. - Fragrance: Choose candles scented with essential oils. - Transparency: Look for clear ingredient labeling and brands committed to natural principles. Section 8: Caring for Non-Toxic Candles Proper Burning Practices Caring for your non-toxic candles ensures they burn efficiently and last longer. Here are some tips: - Trim the Wick: Keep the wick trimmed to about 1/4 inch to avoid excess smoke. - Burn Evenly: Allow the candle to melt evenly across the surface before extinguishing. - Avoid Drafts: Place candles away from drafts to prevent uneven burning. Storing and Cleaning - Storage: Keep candles in a cool, dark place to preserve their scent. - Cleaning: Remove any debris from the candle surface and wipe with a soft cloth if needed.

A: Non-toxic candles are made from natural ingredients like soy or beeswax, free from potentially harmful additives, synthetic fragrances, and paraffin. At Slow North, we use only soy wax and pure essential oils to create a clean-burning experience you can trust. Q: How can I recognize a truly non-toxic candle? A: Look for candles made with 100% natural waxes (such as soy or beeswax), scented with 100% essential oils (or unscented), and made with cotton, paper or wooden wicks. Slow North fully discloses all ingredients, so you can be confident in your choice. Q: What are soy candles? A: Soy candles are made from soy wax, or a soy wax blend. After soybeans are harvested, they're cleaned, cracked, de-hulled, and rolled into flakes. Oil is extracted from the flakes, and then dehydrogenated, a process which converts the oils from unsaturated to saturated, creating a shelf-stable wax that stays solid at room temperature. Q: Why are soy candles better? A: Soy candles don't emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or harmful toxins when burned, and they're made from a renewable source (soybeans). VOCs are compounds that are given off by household products like paints, laundry detergent, and cleaners. They can be [extremely toxic](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/cheatsheet-volatile-organic-compounds), and are often found in high concentrations indoors. The more natural products we can use (like natural candles), the fewer VOCs we'll be emitting into our atmosphere. Q: Are Slow North candles eco-friendly? A: Absolutely! Our commitment to environmental sustainability includes using biodegradable, reusable, and recyclable materials. We prioritize ethical sourcing and offer products that align with our shared eco-conscious values. Q: Where are Slow North candles made? A: All our products are handcrafted by our team in Austin, TX. We take pride in our local production and adherence to high-quality standards. Q: How do I care for my Slow North candles? A: Care includes trimming the wick to 1/4 inch, allowing an even melt pool, and storing in a cool, dark place. Our candles are designed to offer a long-lasting, enjoyable experience with proper care. Q: How do non-toxic candles fit into a clean living lifestyle? A: [Non-toxic candles](https://www.slownorth.com/collections/candles) align with a clean living philosophy by reducing exposure to artificial chemicals and fragrances. Slow North's products offer natural solutions for fragrance and self-care in your home. Q: Can you recycle or reuse the container your candle comes in? A: Some containers (like Slow North's drink-safe glass tumblers) can be [cleaned out and reused](https://www.slownorth.com/blogs/journal/4-simple-ways-to-upcycle-your-used-candle) for anything when your candle is finished. Just discard the last bits of remaining wax, and wipe the container clean with rubbing alcohol. Q: Can I use Slow North candles if I have sensitivities or if traditional candles give me headaches? A: Absolutely! Traditional candles contain synthetic fragrances and chemicals that can cause headaches or reactions.
