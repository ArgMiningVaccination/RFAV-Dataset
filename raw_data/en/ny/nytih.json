Introduction Currently, ischemia heart disease is an overwhelming health problem worldwide [1] [2]. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the phenomenon that ventricular remodeling and cardiac dy sfunction are aggravated, after ischemic myocardium restores blood supply. I/R injury can lead to the changes of myocardial structure and function, then systolic and diastolic dysfunction and lipid metabolism di s- order, which further induce reactive oxygen species and cardiomyocyte apopt o- sis [3]. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis includes two major pathways, the extrinsic pathway via death receptors, and the intrinsic pathway involving mitochondria [4] [5]. Numerous studies have co nfirmed that calcium overload plays a key role in myocardial apoptosis induced by Sieb. et Zucc., a kind of traditional Chinese herb, has effect in nourishing liver and kidney and astringent. Cornus officinalis Total Glycoside s are the main component s of Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc., which ha ve anti-inflammatory effects [7]. Our previous studies have been proved that Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides can improve myocardial ischemia injury by promoting mitochondr i- al biogenesis [ 8]. Nevertheless, it is unclear about the effect of Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides on myocardial ultrastructure and calcium concentration after ischemia/reperfusion injury. To mimic cardiomyocyte I/R injury, we established a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model in myocardial cell. In th is study, we i n- vestigated the protective effect of Cornus officinalis Total i- omyocytes against apop tosis and whether the mechanism involved inhibition calcium overload. 2.

Methods 3.1. Primary Culture of Myocardial Cells Improving the method reference to literatures [ 9] [10], the 1 - 3 days of SD rats were soaked in 70% alcohol for disinfection; then myocardial cells were isolated by enzyme digestion, which were transferred into the complete medium (CM ingredient s: DMEM -HG 500 ml, 10% fetal bovine serum 50 ml, penicil- lin-streptomycin solution 5 ml) to make single cell suspension. After fibroblasts were removed by differential velocity adherent technique, cells were cultured in diverse culture dishes with humidifie d air (5% CO2) at 37 C; Cells were seeded in six -well plates (2 - 5 \u00d7 105). The medium was changed every 24 hours. 3.2. Identification of Primary Myocardial Cells Identification of myocardial cells by immunohistochemistry method, specific procedures reference the instructions of SABC anti -Sarcomeric actin kit. The expression of actin in myocardium was observed, and the positive rate of my o- cardial cells was calculated. 3.3. Experimental Grouping and Establishment of H/R Model The isolated primary myocardial cells were divided into five groups: 1) Control group: Cells were cul tured under normal conditions. 2) H/R group: To establish the hypoxia condition of the H/R model, after 3 days of normal culture, cells were subjected to hypox ia using glucose -free and FBS -free DMEM/F12 buffer that surface were sealed with sterile liquid paraffin, which were cultured in a hypoxia chamber suffused with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 Cells were then transferred to 10% FBS DMEM/F12 in normal conditions for reoxygenation 24 or 48 hours. 3) Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides for 24 and then were subjected to hypoxia/ reoxygenation as H/R group.

K. Chen et al. DOI: 10.4236/cm.2019.101001 4 Chinese Medicine 3.4. Determination of Myocardial Apoptosis Ratio Using flow cytometry assay. Following successful establishment of cardiomy o- cyte H/R injury model and different t reatments, cells of each group were co l- lected and resuspended at a density of 1 \u00d7 106/ml. The Annexin V/PI of apo p- totic cells were counted, specifically as follows: supernatant was abandoned, all operations are strictly operated according to Annexin V -FITC kit instructions. Cells were incubated and annexin V -fluorescein isoth i- ocyanate for min in the dark; under the 488 nm excitation light, the apoptotic rate was determined by flow cytometry. The above experiment was repeated three times. 3.5. Examination of Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+] I) in Cardiomyocytes Cells were seeded in 96 -well plates under serum -free culture conditions for 24 hours, were washed with HBSS solution 3 times, were added Fluo -4/AM wor k- ing flu id and were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 37 C thermostat. Next, cells were washed with HBSS solution 3 times to fully remove Fluo -4/AM wor k- ing fluid. Finally, using flow cytometry to examine intracellular free calcium concentration, the excitation wavelength was 494 nm and the emission wave- length was 516 nm. 3.6. Ultrastructure of Myocardial Cells under Transmission Electron Microscope After the corresponding treatment, cells of each group were washed, digested, centrifugalized, collected, and fixed by fixation fluid (2.5% Glutaraldehyde +2% Paraformaldehyde). Following a series of acetone dehydration (70% acetone for 15 min, 80% acetone for 15 min, 90% acetone for 15 min, and 100% acetone for 10 min), cells were embedded in rubber. Then embedded block were cut into sections of 1 to 10 m by microtome and sections were stained with dye liquor. Lastly, the ultrastructure of myocardial cells was observed under transmission electron microscope. 3.7. Statistical Analysis SPSS 13.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The experimental data were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by ANOVA and paired t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 4. Results 4.1. Morphological Observation of Primary Myoc ardial Cells Myocardial cells were observed under inverted microscope. Newly inoculated cells were suspended in the culture medium, round and bright. After 24 hours of culture ( Figure 1), most cells attach ed to the wall, gradually extended pseud o- podia and became to polygon shape. The nucleus was small and round. Even it K. Chen et al.

(a) Primary culture 24 h; (b) Pri- mary culture 48 h; (c) Primary culture 72 h. can occasionally be seen that contraction of a single cell, however the pulse a m- plitude was small, speed was an average of 20 - 30 times /minute. After cultured for 48 h (Figure 1 and Figure 2), cells were found gathering closely and grew over all the bottom. It was can be seen that more than 90% of the cells begun to pulse at a frequency of 60 - 80 times/ min. The primary cells fused into pieces and formed a monolayer after cultured for 72 h (Figure 1 ), which pulse fr e- quency is 110 - 130 times/ min. 4.2. Identification of Primary Myocardial Cells ( Figure 2) Myocardial cells contain -Sarcomeric actin [11] and we chose SABC anti -Sarcomeric actin as the first antibody in this study. Therefore, the cytoplasm of myocardial cells should be dark brown after staining. After repeated three calculations, the positive rate of myocardial cells w as 96.32%, 97.81% and 96.95%. The average value was 97.027%, which is purity of myocardial cells. 4.3. Effects of Cornus officinalis Total Glycoside on the Apoptosis Rates of Rat Cardiomyocytes Induced by H/ R (Figure 3) The apoptosis rates of cardiomyocytes w ere tested by flow cytometry of Annex- in-V/PI double staining. As shown in Figure 3 , the apoptosis rate in the control group was lower than that of the H/R group, Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides low-dose group, middle -dose group and high -dose group (P < 0.01); compared with the H/R group, the apoptosis rates in middle -dose group and high -dose group was significantly decreased, the difference was statistic ally significant (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between low -dose group and H/R group. Above results suggested that Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides, mainly middle -dose and high -dose, cardioprotective f- fects by inhibiting H/R apoptosis of on Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration ( I) ( Figure 4) In this study, Fluo4 -am probes were used to label myocardial cells and intrace l- lular free calcium concentration ( [Ca2+] I) was detected by flow cytometry. In the H/R group, the relative fluorescence intensity of Ca2+ was about 340, which K. Chen et al. DOI: 10.4236/cm.2019.101001 6 Chinese Medicine Figure 2.

The relative fluorescence intensity of Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides low -dose group, middle -dose group and high -dose group were approximately 330, 110 and 200. Compared to the H/R group, fluorescence intensity of middle -dose group and high -dose group decreased significantly (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), indicating that pretreatment K. Chen et al.

There was no significant di f- ference betw een low -dose group and H/R group, which that interve n- tion of low -dose Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides had no effect on H/R- induced calcium overload. 4.5. Effects of Cornus officinalis Total Glycoside on (Figure 5) Mitochondrial morphological changes were observed by the electron micr o- scope. The ultrastructure of myocardial cells was not abnormal in control group, such as loose nuclear chromatin, uniform density, complete membrane of mit o- chondria, dense crista, etc. In contrast, while changes in mitochondrial mo r- phology, including disorganization, swelling, and reduction of the crista, were increased. After pretreatment of Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides, the degree of myocardial injury induced by H/R was significantly weakened and the mit o- chondrial membrane was intact in middle -dose and high -dose group. Whereas, the damage of myocardial mitochondria caused by H/R was not significantl y improved in low -dose group. 5. D iscussion Our previous studies revealed that Cornus officinalis Total Glycoside s, a pro m- extract , inhibit cardiomy ocyte mouse in vitro biogenesis [8]. Mitochondria are important of cardiac myocytes. Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury is common in clinic and its mechanism is complex . I/R is closely relat ed to card i- omyocyte apoptosis, calcium overload and release of inflammatory mediators [13]. And many injury factors including H/R injury can induce apoptosis by a c- tivating death receptor dependent signal transduction pathway and mitochondrial K. Chen et al. DOI: 10.4236/cm.2019.101001 8 Chinese Medicine Figure 5. Effects of Cornus total glycoside on mitocho group. dependent signal transduction pathway [14]. Studies have shown that the i n- crease of intracellular free calcium concentration in some pathological cond i- tions can make a large number of Ca2+ accumulate in the mitochondria [ 15]. Af- ter the myocardial hypoxia/reoxygenation injur y, the activity of Ca2+-ATPase in the cells changed, promoting Ca2+ to enter the cell s, causing calcium overload. The increase of intracellular calcium induced the decrease of mitochondrial ATP formation, which further affects the metabolism of myocardial cells. At the same time, the increase of intracellular free calcium will activate calcium dependent proteolytic enzymes, such as phospholipase, protease, endonuclease, directly damage the plasma membrane, decompose cytoskeleton and nucleic acid, and cause the energy depletion of myocardial cells until irreversible damage. This study showed that H/R treatment caused mitochondrial dysfunction and card i- omyocyte apoptosis, whereas, pretreatment with Cornus officinalis Total Glyc improved mitochondrial dys function and attenuated cell apoptosis. Our results showed that the intracellular Ca2+ concentration increased signifi- cantly after treatment by hypoxia/reoxygenation, indicating that hypo x- ia/reoxygenation resulted in calcium overload. The possible mechanis ms are as follows : when cardiomyocytes are anoxic, oxygen supply and oxidation su b- strates decrease, and then the function of ATP dependent myofibrils membrane calcium pump decreases, resulting in the decrease of Ca 2+ scavenging ability and Ca2+ overload in cells [16]. In addition, hypoxia leads to the increase of pH in cardiac myocytes and the enhancement of Na+-H+ exchange, which can reduce the degree o f acidosis. However, the increase of intracellular Na+ concentration can activate Na+-Ca2+ exchange, which in turn causes the increase of Ca2+ con- centration in cells [ 17]. K. Chen et al. DOI: 10.4236/cm.2019.101001 9 Chinese Medicine Intracellular calcium overload is the last common pathway of various damage factors. When H/R, both the inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ influx and the r e- duction of intracellular Ca2+ release can effectively reduce the occurrence of ca r- diomyocyte apoptosis [18]. Our study indicated that pretreatment with mi dle-dose and high -dose of Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides can block H/R- induced calcium overload o f myocardial cells. By electron microscopy, we found that mitochondria were swollen, membrane ruptured when the myocar- dium was injured by hypoxia/reoxygenation. After pretreatment Total of myocardial injury indu ced by H/R was significantly weakened and the mitochondrial membrane was intact in mi d- dle-dose and high- dose group. The accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria enhances the permeability of the outer membrane of mitochondria, resulting in the increase of apopt osis factor in mitochondria, and further induce s apoptosis. -dose and high -dose of Cornus officinalis Total Glycosides could cardioprotective inh biting H/R -induced apoptosis of myocardial cells. After H/R injury, the survival rate o f myocardial cells decreased obviously, the rate of apoptosis increased evidently, the concentration of Ca2+ in cells increased, and the mitochondrial function of myocardial cells were destroyed. Based on the above results, we concluded that Cornus officin alis Total Glycosides pretrea t- ment can inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis and calcium overload during H/R i n- jury. However , the underlying mechanisms require us to further study. Source of Support This work was supported by the Guangdong province administration of trad i- tional Chinese medicine (NO: 20181059) .
