Distribution to healthcare workers and elderly residents are already underway in both the U.K. and the U.S. With a new vaccine, many questions arise in regards to the trials, side effects, efficacy, and distribution, so this guide was created to become one of the most comprehensive resources on the first vaccine authorized in the Western world. Clinical Trials How the Trial Was Conducted The trial was conducted in multiple locations and in multiple countries with participants having a 50% chance of receiving either the vaccine candidate or a placebo. This trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled study which is often considered the \"gold standard\" because it eliminates potential biases when interpreting data. The study was \"observer-blinded,\" which means that participants and investigators did not see the vial that contains the vaccine candidate or placebo to account for any visual differences in vials. The study enrollment and follow-up occurred during the period of July 27, 2020 to November 14, 2020. Study Locations 155 sites across the globe were used to recruit participants for the clinical trial. The U.S. sites were located in 39 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Site locations outside the U.S. included Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, and Turkey. [2] Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria Inclusion: Male or female ages 18-55 years, 65-85 years, or 12 years at randomization. Participants under 18 years of age cannot be enrolled in the European Union. Also, must be willing to comply with all scheduled visits, lab tests, lifestyle considerations, vaccination plan, and other study procedures, considered healthy by clinical judgment of the investigator as determined by medical history and physical examination, participants who are at risk of acquiring Covid-19, and those capable of providing personal signed informed consent. [3] Exclusion: History of severe allergic reaction to any component of the study intervention, previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of Covid-19, receipt of medications intended to prevent Covid-19, other medical or psychiatric conditions including recent or active suicidal ideations or laboratory abnormalities that may risk participation or make participant inappropriate for study, participation in another study within the last 28 days, receipt of blood products within the last 60 days, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant or breastfeeding women, previous coronavirus vaccination, individuals receiving treatment for immunosupporesive therapies (ie. cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids), bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding in a wound, or Pfizer employees or trial staff directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members. [3] Exclusion only in Phase 1 of trials: At-risk individuals of severe Covid-19 symptoms (eg. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, current vaping/smoking, history of chronic smoking within prior year, BMI over 30kg/m2, and anticipated need of immunosuppressive treatment within 6 months), individuals currently working in occupations at high risk of exposure (eg. healthcare worker, emergency response personnel), individuals with history of or active autoimmune disease requiring therapeutic intervention, regular receipt of inhaled/nebulized corticosteroids, positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG antibodies, any screening and/or blood chemistry laboratory value that meets definition of Grade 1 abnormality, positive HIV and/or hepatitis B or C test, SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-positive nasal swab within 24 hours before receipt of study intervention. [3] Exclusion only in Phase 1 and 2 of trials: Known infection with HIV or Hepatitis B or C. [3] Trial Participants Initially, enrollment was planned at 30,000 people, but expanded to include approximately 44,000 people in the trial. The expansion allowed Pfizer to include healthy males and females over the age of 12, as well as people with chronic, stable HIV, HCV, or HBV infections. Efficacy From Clinical Trial According to the final analysis of efficacy, the success criterion was met and the trial reported 95% vaccine efficacy for all participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In ages 16-55, the efficacy was 95.6%, while those over the age of 55 had a 93.7% efficacy. The same analysis was done in both participants with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, with all participants registering a 94.6% efficacy. In this analysis, those within 16-55 years of age had a 95% efficacy, while those over the age of 55 had 93.8% efficacy. The overall subgroup analysis reported 94.6% efficacy. Further breakdowns were reported by at risk populations, obesity, sex, ethnicity, and race. Efficacy in hispanic or latino populations reported a minuscule 0.2% difference from non-hispanic/latino participants. Of the races included in this clinical trial, zero vaccine candidate participants who were American Indian or Alaska native, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander became infected with SARS-CoV-2 whereas one or more of the placebo group did. In the Asian, Multiracial, and White racial subgroup, one or more vaccine candidate participants became infected with SARS-CoV-2. One or more of the placebo group became infected, with the highest infection being 153 participants in the White placebo subgroup. Data on the exact number of total trial participants by race was unavailable at the time of this writing. At minimum, for the sex, age, obesity, and at-risk categories, the efficacy never dipped below 91.7%, with advanced age being the lowest of efficacy (although still very high and it met the predetermined success criterion). For those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, hypertension, and diabetes, the efficacy remained at 93% or higher. Only in malignancy did data show an efficacy of 75.7%, which was still above the predetermined success criterion. For severe Covid-19 occurrence after the second dose, only one vaccine candidate participant developed severe symptoms compared to nine placebo recipients. Five of the remaining six placebo participants were hospitalized, with two of those admitted to the intensive care unit. This suggests that the vaccine does provide protection from severe Covid-19 disease, with efficacy estimated at 88.9% against severe symptoms. Reported Side Effects During Clinical Trials For all age groups, site pain was reported as the most frequent local adverse reaction. When compared to Shingrix (shingles vaccine) or Flucelvax (influenza vaccine), site pain was reported at a higher rate in the Covid-19 vaccine. It is worth noting that up to 14% of placebo recipients also reported site pain. While the Covid-19 vaccine reported a higher incidence of immune-response adverse reactions than Flucelvax (but nearly on par with Shingrix), it's reports of redness, swelling, and fever were similar to or lower than Flucelvax. The overall local reactions were listed as site pain, redness, and swelling, while adverse reactions were listed as fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain. Unsolicited (Non-Serious) Adverse Events During Clinical Trials A deeper look showed that lymphadenopathy (enlargement of one or more lymph nodes) were more notable in the vaccine group. This refers to an immunological response after vaccination. Bell's palsy (temporary weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles) was reported in four vaccine candidate participants and none in the placebo group. One case was resolved within 3 days, with the others reported as continuing or resolving at the data cutoff of November 14, 2020. At the time, they had a duration of 10, 15, and 21 days. The observed frequency was consistent with the expected rate in the general population, so there was no clear basis of a causal relationship, but the FDA recommends continued surveillance for cases. Female study participants were screened for pregnancy prior to each vaccination, with a positive test resulting in exclusion or discontinuation from study vaccination. Twenty-three participants became pregnant during the clinical trial and the only unsolicited adverse events (AE) were in the placebo group. They were listed as spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and retained products of conception. Serious Adverse Events During Clinical Trials A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in disability, or causes death. Serious Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) are reported to regulatory agencies, as well as an outside group of independent experts (Data Monitoring Committee, also known as DMC) which has access to unblinded data. To date, the DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. [5] Further investigation showed six deaths (two vaccine, four placebo) occurred during the total reporting period of the trial (April 29, 2020-November 14, 2020). Both vaccine recipients were over 55 years of age, with one experiencing cardiac arrest and the other from (pre-existing) arteriosclerosis (thickening/hardening of arterial walls). The placebo recipients died from myocardial infarction (heart attack), hemorrhagic stroke, or unknown causes with three of the four being over the age of 55. All deaths represent a similar rate of occurrence in the general population with no causal link to the vaccine. In non-fatal serious adverse events, the most common cases where the vaccine group was numerically higher than the placebo group were: appendicitis (0.04%), acute myocardial infarction (0.02%), and cerebrovascular accident (0.02%). In reverse, the placebo group experienced numerically higher SAEs than the vaccine group for pneumonia (0.03%), atrial fibrillation (0.02%), and syncope (0.02%). [4] Covid-19 Vaccine How It Works Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a molecule composed of nucleotides linked in a unique order to convey genetic information for the cells to produce the proteins or antigens encoded by the mRNA. Once mRNA in a vaccine is inside of the body's cells, the cells use their genetic machinery to translate the genetic information and produce the antigens encoded by the mRNA vaccine. The antigens are then displayed on the cell surface, where they are recognized by the immune system which generates a response, including the production of antibodies against the antigen. An mRNA vaccine, unlike traditional vaccines, do not use an inactivated virus, but rather a portion of the viral sequence encoding for one or more viral antigens. [7] Vaccine Ingredients The Pfizer vaccine contains lipids dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose. [1] For a simple breakdown, the vaccine contains the active ingredient (mRNA), lipids, salts, and sugar. Vaccine Storage The vaccine must be stored at temperatures of -94 degrees Fahrenheit, with special storage equipment and transportation required. The vaccine may be kept in a refrigerator for up to 5 days. Vaccine Cost Initial reports estimate that the company plans to charge $20 per dose for the vaccine. Vaccine Administration The vaccine is given via intramuscular injection in the upper arm (deltoid muscle) in a series of two doses 3 weeks apart. Known Benefits The known benefits of the vaccine include the reduction in risk of confirmed Covid-19 after first dose and before second dose, as well as further reduction in risk of confirmed Covid-19 following the second dose (7+ days). There was also a reduction in risk of confirmed severe Covid-19 any time after the first dose. Further Data Needed The vaccine's effectiveness against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is limited. The vaccine demonstrated high efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 \"which may translate to overall prevention of transmission in population with high enough vaccine intake, though it is possible that if efficacy against asymptomatic cases in combination with reduced mask-wearing and social distancing could result in significant continued transmission.\" [4] Also, as there is a limited length of follow-up at the final analysis of the study, sustained efficacy is not possible to assess over a period longer than 2 months at this time. Vaccine Approval UK MHPRA Approval On Wednesday, December 2, 2020, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency granted emergency use authorization for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech. [6] Nearly 800,000 doses have been secured by the government, with orders placed for up to 40 million doses in total. Most are not expected to be supplied until 2021. US FDA Approval On Friday, December 11, 2020, the FDA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use authorization (EUA). This authorization is \"for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older.\" [1] The U.S. government agreed in July 2020 to pay for the receipt of the first 100 million doses, with the ability to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses. Vaccine Distributions UK As of Tuesday, December 12, 2020, the first U.K. resident received the vaccine, with many more healthcare workers and people over the age of 80 to follow. USA As of Monday, December 14, 2020, hospitals in all 50 states began receiving shipments of the vaccine, with the first U.S. resident (an ICU nurse) receiving it the same day. While healthcare workers and long-term care facility residents will be among the first to receive the vaccine, the goal is provide the vaccine to the general adult population by the middle of 2021. Getting the Vaccine As the vaccine becomes available to the general public, it is important to follow health and safety guidelines as established by the CDC and the facility that is administering the vaccine. This may include social distancing where applicable at the facility and mask protocols while receiving your vaccine. You should receive a vaccination card that lists the date of your first dose, as well as a return date for the second dose. An informational sheet on the vaccine will also be given either by paper or electronically. Unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get the second shot, it is important to receive the second dose of the vaccine even if you experienced side effects with the first one. You may register with v-safe, which is a free tool that utilizes text messages or surveys and provides check-ins post-vaccination, as well as a reminder for your second dose. It is important to note that you may not be protected until a week or two after the second dose as it takes times for your body to build protection against the virus. It is important that safety precautions for your health are still followed during this time and in accordance to the CDC and governmental guidelines. For more information on what to expect, you can visit the CDC's website, [What to Expect at Your Appointment to Get Vaccinated for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html). Vaccine Long-Term Pfizer-BioNTech Plans Pfizer-BioNTech plan to continue monitoring participant's health over a full two years after their second dose to further collect safety and long-term outcomes data. Once analysis of the data is complete, Pfizer and BioNTech intend to submit efficacy and safety data of the Phase 3 trial for peer review in a scientific journal. [5] Herd Immunity According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, a 75-80% vaccination rate of Americans would provide a herd immunity within months. If participation is significantly lower, such as 40-50%, herd immunity may take much longer for that same level of protection. He stated that if we could reach that \"by the time we get to the end of summer... we may actually have enough herd immunity as we get to the end of 2021.\" With herd immunity, it is possible to resume a semblance of normality. With the Pfizer vaccine and the many other potential vaccine candidates, like those by Moderna and AstraZeneca, on the way, the world is finally on the verge of returning to normal and countless lives will be spared from a preventable death. When the vaccines become available to the general population, a link will be included below on how to find a local vaccine center near you. With 2021 on the horizon, it may not be that long of a wait fortunately. Sources: [1] Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
