She has taught courses in traditional herbal medicines to tribal members at the Port Gamble S'Kallam and Lower Elwa tribes. As a primary care provider, she works with all types of patients and conditions. She believes empowering the patient, individualizing treatment plans, and encouraging the body's own natural healing abilities are essential in the promotion of health. She uses a combination of physical modalities like herbs and acupuncture with a mind body approach focusing on patient awareness, empathy, and potential. Outside the clinic she participates in her Lakota Sioux culture and traditions. She was interviewed by the NW Federation of Community Organizations for stories of Native Americans and healthcare in their publication, An American Debt Unpaid, which was presented to the US Congress in 2009.

In 2005, Turtle earned her undergraduate degree in Sociology from Bryn Mawr College, in Pennsylvania.

Turtle practices medicine largely because she delights in hearing people's stories and encouraging herself and others to live rich, engaged lives. She believes that natural medicine offers us the chance to renegotiate our responses to life's challenges, to see health and dis-ease as parts of the human experience. In addition to acupuncture, Turtle uses craniosacral therapy, Chinese herbs, moxibustion, and qigong in her practice. She believes that each needle, each herb, each moment that we spend in contact, has the power to facilitate the restoration of balance within, and to help us move toward greater wholeness. When Turtle isn't at Seven Circles, she is doing her qigong practice, singing with the Portland's Threshold Singers, spending time with her family and friends, and being outdoors as much as possible.
