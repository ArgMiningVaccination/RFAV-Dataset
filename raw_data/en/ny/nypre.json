Read more about the additional services we offer below. Reiki with Dr. Jenn! (Offered only at our Denver/Aurora location.) Reiki (pronounced \"ray-key\") is a safe, gentle, non-invasive form of hands-on healing that vitalizes your life force, balances the energy in your body, and supports the body's natural ability to heal itself. Reiki energy healing assists in removing blockages in our energy field, which allows the energy to flow freely again, restoring balance. It addresses the physical, emotional, and mental bodies promoting wholeness in Mind, Body, and Spirit. What Reiki Treats: A Reiki treatment may: Bring about a peaceful, deep state of relaxation Dissolve energy blockages and tension Detoxify the body Support the well-being of a person receiving traditional medical treatment that is debilitating (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, kidney dialysis) Supply universal life force energy to the body Stimulate the body's immune system Help to relieve pain Stimulate tissue and bone healing after injury or surgery Increase the vibrational frequency on physical, mental emotional and spiritual levels What to Expect: Dr. Jenn will use a series of hand positions laid on or above the body. She may remain quiet allowing you to go into a state of relaxation, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask. The only clothing removed during a Reiki session is your shoes. Reiki sensations are subjective and can range from simply feeling relaxed, to experiencing tingling, warmth, or a sense of wellbeing. Some recipients have experienced pain relief, lowered anxiety, increased mental clarity, and feeling more centered. If you have questions about how Reiki works or if it will benefit you, book a Free Phone Consultation with Dr. Jenn Conte in our online calendar. \"I met with Dr. Jenn for a Reiki session and am so happy I did so. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was going on in my body, but I had felt out of sorts .... I had no idea what to expect from the session itself, but Jenn was kind and wonderful and walked me through everything beforehand, explained some crystals she had chosen based on our previous conversations, and answered any questions I had for her. If you're looking for a place to try Reiki - I highly recommend Jenn. She is an absolutely lovely human. The session itself was so relaxing and peaceful, and I felt a significant change in my own body in the next few days as my energy found some better flow. I will definitely be going back! ~ Google Review \"If you want to do trauma work for yourself, Jenniffer Conte, is well trained and super talented to get you results. I went from feeling like a miserable child as an adult to being a happy and relieved adult. Amazing stuff \u2014 pretty much a new lease on life.\" ~ Google Review "}
