The program focuses on an interdisciplinary understanding of complex issues and the leadership challenges of successful interventions in public health. Graduates leave as well -rounded public health professionals with a heightened understanding of the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to pu blic health practice. The class size ranges between 20 and 30. Originally dominated by mid -career physicians, the program now accepts senior medical students, residents, and fellows. In addition, we also actively recruit applicants with a range of professi onal background who hold a master's degree or the equivalent, and who have significant health care experience or interest in public health. Applicants from the fields of journalism, business, social work, anthropology, economics, law, and others are encour aged if their future career paths include public health activities and/or significant interaction with public health systems. The Interdisciplinary Program's curricular flexibility allows successful applicants, in consultation with their faculty advisers, to develop an individualized course of study tailored to meet their needs. In addition to the required courses at the School of Public Health, elective courses may be chosen from any of the academic offerings across the Berkeley campus. A mentored MPH proj ect, to be conducted throughout the year, is required for completion of the program. MISSION The mission of the 11- month program is to offer our students the opportunity to gain a professional skillset that will allow them to take on the most pressing publ ic health challenges. These skills will be taught in required courses, electives, and small group seminars that run throughout the year. The goal is for students to apply these skills as they develop, implement, and disseminate a final MPH project. The Int erdisciplinary Program core faculty are committed to student success during the year and after graduation. COMMITMENT TO ANTI -RACISM At Berkeley Public Health we strive to create an anti -racist learning environment and commit to teaching this course, to the best of our ability, with an antiracist, racial justice, and equity -minded lens. We invite you to take this journey with us by being fully present. We are interested in your perspectives and in the value and knowledge you bring to help make this an enriching classroom environment. 7 We view this syllabus as a dynamic document oriented toward learning and not just coverage of material; thus, we may add or modify topics covered, assignments, and resources (e.g., required readings/videos) slightly based on th e needs and interests of students in the course. We welcome feedback and input at any time and invite careful reflection of any modifications that may help improve the course in the future. As your instructor team, we agree that: Course content will include relevant information pertaining to BIPOC communities (e.g., reading s; f ilms; speakers; data, etc.) Students are the experts of their own experiences. Your world lens is welcomed; and as students, you are invited to lift up information and/or data that is relevant to the course material. Everyone i s a te acher and everyone is a studen t. We cannot speak on behalf of all groups, or fully understand the issues, concerns and history of all BIPOC. However, we are willing to li sten and learn, admit mistakes and engage in ongoing cultural humility practices.8 CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS The curriculum for the Interdisciplinary MPH Program is an intensive, full -time program. Students in the program are required to complete 42 semester units of course credit between July and May. Students are expected to start their studies by enrolling in the Summer Session prior to the Fall Semester in which they enter the program. After completing one or two summer courses (3 -8 units), students take a heavy course load (17- 19 units per semester), in order to satisfy the 42 -unit requirement. Consequently, students should not plan to work during the semester, and should make every effort to minimize work-related responsibilities while at school. We advise students to enroll in the six- week Summer Session D courses on Epidemiologic Methods (PH 250A) and /or the Introduction to Biostatistics (PH 142). This will reduce their course load to manageable levels in the Fall and Spring semesters. Students with previous biostatistics or epidemiology experience may take both summer courses provided that they can make a full-time commitment to coursework beginning in early July. Students who have taken rigorous or advanced epidemiology or biostatistics in the past are encouraged to take the exemption exams in epidemiology and biostatistics in late August. Passing out of a course, however, does not decrease the 42- unit requirement for graduation. Students are required to attend a one -unit Interdisciplinary Summer Seminar during which they will begin to develop ideas for their year -long MPH project. The course number is PH 292. Students should enroll in this course for one unit with the LETTER GRADE grading option. The Interdisciplinary MPH core requirements consist of nine courses totaling 24 units. These include: BIOSTATISTICS PH 141, or PH 142, or PH 245, or PH 252 (4-5 units) There are several ways to satisfy the Biostatistics requirement: 1.Take PH 142 (Intro to Biostatistics) in (strongly recommended); 2.Take PH 142 (Intro to Biostatistics) in the Fall; 245 (Intro Multivariate Statistics) in the Fall; 4.Take PH 252 (Epidemiological Analysis) in the Spring 5.Take and pass the Biostatistics exemption exam during welcome week before the Fall Semester begins. If passing the exemption exam, a total of 42 units is still required for graduation. EPIDEMIOLOGY PH 250A (3 units) or PH 250B (4 units) There are several ways to satisfy the Epidemiology requirement: 1.Take PH 250A (Epidemiological Methods I) in the Summer (strongly recommended) or Fall; 2.Take PH 250B (Epidemiological Methods II) in the Fall. 3.Take and pass the epidemiology exemption exam during welcome week before the Fall Semester begins. If passing the exemption exam, a total of 42 units is still required for graduation.9 BREADTH COURSES PH 200J \u2014Health Policy and Management (2 units): in the Fall Semester PH 200L \u2014Health and Social Behavior (2 units): in the Fall Semester PH 200K \u2014Environmental Health Sciences (2 units): in the Spring Semester NEW: PH 291A - Preparation for Public Health Practice (or PH W289 or PH 223C as equivalent) INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM SEMINAR SERIES PH 292 (1) - Summer Interdisciplinary Seminar (1 unit) PH 292 (12) - Fall, 4 units, and PH 292 (7) \u2014Spring, 4 units: a full -year course designed to enhance knowledge and practice skills and to provide guidance and mentorship in the development and implementation of a culminating MPH Project. The one -year Inter disciplinary MPH Program requires completion of a research project (this is an MPH Project, not a thesis). Projects may take a variety of forms including community -based projects, research studies, needs assessments, program evaluations, analyses of seco ndary data, or policy analyses. Projects are presented at the end of the Spring Semester in written and oral formats and fulfill the School of Public Health Comprehensive Exam requirement. The oral presentation and written paper for the MPH project satisfy the Public Health Practice and Comprehensive Examination requirements for the degree. A four -unit class is the equivalent of 180 hours or work per semester (45 hours per unit) - about 10-15 hours of work a week dedicated to your MPH research project. We also recommend that you take PH 291, the Preparation for Public Health Practice Workshop Series, a one- unit course offered by the Center for Public Health Practice with a S/U grading option only. The remaining 19 -20 units are available for electives that may be used to customize a curriculum that fits your career -building needs . Up to four units from previously completed graduate coursework may also be applied towards the 42 units, subject to 'rules for transfer units' and approval from Graduate Division. Curricular requirements are summarized below. SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIALTY AREAS While taking electives towards the MPH, students may also simultaneously complete a Specialty Area, or minor, in a particular area. Specialty Areas draw faculty and students across many areas of study. They require that students complete nine units of specific courses and electives. The School offers the following specialty areas of study: Aging Global Health Maternal and Child Health Multicultural Health Public Health Nutrition Please refer to the School of Public Health website for more information about the Specialty Areas: http://sph.berkeley.edu/graduate- degrees/specialty-areas 10 University of California, Berkeley - School of Public Health Interdisciplinary MPH Program CURRICULUM 2021-22 The curriculum for the Interdisciplinary MPH program is an intensive, full -time program.

The culminating assignments - an oral presentation to peers and colleagues, and a final project report worthy of publication - serve as the oral and written components of the comprehensive examination required for graduation. Please review the following guidelines carefully to ensure that you meet all requirements. O RAL PRESENTATION GUIDELINES Your oral presentation serves as the oral component of your comprehensive examination required for graduation. The presentation should describe what your project is designed to deliver and the outcomes you anticipate or hypothesize. Make sure to present your data, even if you have not completed the analysis. If your data gathering and analysis is not complete at the time of your oral presentation date, don't worry. You may call it a \"work in progress.\" The oral presentation is not supposed to be a presentation of the written paper; rather, it is a demonstration that affirms your understanding of PH investigative processes, the appropriate use of statistical tools, and your ability to present. These should follow the standard presentation outline: Title Background and Public health significance Project goal and objectives Methods: study design, ethical review, study population and partner organizations,variables, data collection methods and instruments, data analysis Results - completed, up -to-date or hypothesized D iscussion: Key findings, comparison to other studies Project impact: What is the relevance of this work in the bigger picture? Has it, orwill it actually affect the lives of the people whose needs you sought to address? Plans for project sustainability and dissemination Project limitations and changes you would make if you had the opportunity to startover Acknowledgements23 P RESENTATION TIPS We strongly encourage attention to the following tips on how to make your presentation the best that if can be. Approach the presentation as if telling a story. Try to relax and enjoy the experience. Speak to and engage the audience. A slide on the public health significance of your project is required. Be focused. This is to be a 15 -20 minute presentation with 5 minutes for questions (total: 25 minutes maximum). Practice in advance, time yourself, avoid redundancy,and cut out unnecessary material. Get feedback in advance - from a classmate, colleague or professor. Prepare answers for expected questions. In previous years students have found it helpful to provide a handout. Use Powerpoint, Prezi or similar presentation software - but use it effectively. Use a variety of media on the slides (e.g., text, photos, diagrams, graphs, tables) and alsoconsider using brief video or audio. Count on one slide per minute, with no more than approximately 15 -20 slides total. Be sure to include a slide with all contri butors and their affiliations. Put no more than 7 -9 lines of text on a single slide as more than that is unreadable. Use graphs liberally. P RESENTATION LOGISTICS Oral project presentations are scheduled during class time between mid -March 19 and late April . We will use our Friday class time for these presentations. Your audience will be asked to write down a few comments for your consideration. We encourage you invite your mentor, interns or anyone else you would like to see you present your work. PR ESENTATION SCHEDULE We will circulate a sign- up sheet for the online presentations in early February. If you are not happy with your assigned session date, please negotiate with other students to exchange dates. Please let Anke know ASAP if you have changed your date so that she can adjust the schedule. 24 FINAL REPORT GUIDELINES The written final report fulfills the written comprehensive examination requirement for the MPH degree. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that you can apply knowledge and principles learned from your coursework in addressing a current public health ch allenge. Your project paper should be in publishable condition with perfect spelling, grammar, and organization. You can choose to write it as a longer report, or try to follow the \"Guidelines for Authors\" instructions for a specific journal you have in mind if you consider publication. Be assured that it will be harder to write a succinct 3,000 -6,000 word manuscript for publications than a longer report that has more flexible page limits. Scientific writing is all about a structured presentation. Most journals will use a similar scientific format: o Title, Abstract (300 words or less) o Introduction (background/ situational analysis) - should include your December literature review, a statement as to why the problem addressed in your project is significant for public health, and a statement about how the objectives for the project address that problem o Methods - should describe details on study design, ethical review, study population and partner organizations, variables, data collection methods and instru ments, data analysis. o Results - should describe your findings and their reliability (your data analysis) o Discussion - should go into detail about your key findings and their importance for the field, implications for policy/programs/research, limitations, lessons learned, and next steps. Any barriers to completing the work? How do your results compare to the findings in the peer literature? o Recommendations - based on your work, what further actions would you recommend to address this problem? How might yo ur findings be implemented on a larger scale? Length and format: About 10 -15 pages, double spaced. EXTRA: tables, graphs, references, and any other appendices such as surveys etc. Feel free to write the paper as a manuscript for the journal you selected for publication, following their length and fo rmatting requirements. Check out \"Instructions for Authors\" pages in the American Journal of Public Health for information on formatting references, tables, and graph headings For citations and references, please use AMA style or a style appropriate for your field Please load your Final Report onto BCourses by 11:59 pm on Sunday, May 8. 25 FAQS ANSWERED FOR INCOMING INTERDISCIPLINARY MPH STUDENTS ACADEMIC YEAR 2021-22 1.I s there a minimum grade required for required courses and a required overall GPA? Yes-- students must attain a B- or better in the breadth course requirements (Epidemiology PH 250A; Biostatistics PH 142; Health Policy & Management 200J ; E nvironmental Heal th PH 200K; and Health and Social Behavior PH 200L). Studen ts w ho attain less than a B- will be required to retake the course. To receive the MPH degree, the student must also meet the Good Academic Standing Rule with an overall 3.0 GPA and a B average. 2.C an I work during the 11 -month program? T he full course load required is 42 semester units for the year, which is approximately 5- 6 classes per semester - a very high course load compared to students in the 2- year MPH program who have to complete 48 units over 2 years. While some of our clinical fellows can fit in a few monthly shifts on selected days, like weekends or over holiday period s, w e do not recommend any kind of regular part -time job or full -time job. 3.Sum mer session: How do I decide which summer course(s) to take? Students are required to take the Summer Interdisciplinary MPH Seminar PH 292 (1) , c ourse control number 50770. In addition, we also recommend taking Biostatistics PH 142 and Epidemiology PH 250A. The 2021 summer session runs from July 6 to Augu st 13. A s this is a heavy a course load for beginners on these topics, we recommend th at y ou do not work during the Summer Session. If you're not able to take all three course s, p lease check in with the Interdisciplinary Program faculty to make alternate plans. 4.D o the summer session courses satisfy the MPH requirements for Biostatistics and Epidemiology? Yes, PH 142 satisfies the Biostatistics requirement . Y es, PH 250A satisfies the Epidemiology requirement 5.C an I take the Biostatistics and Epidemiology exemption exams to satisfy the requirements?You can satisfy the Biostatistics and Epidemiology requirements by passing the exemption exams, which will be offered just before the Fall semester. You will receivenotice of these exams in advance. Please email Deanine Johnson at ipmph@berkeley.edu if you have questions. Please note that if you satisfy the Biostatistics and Epidemiologyrequirements by passing the exemption exams, you will NOT receive unit credit forthem and will still need to co mplete 42 units of course work in order to graduate . 6.Can you recommend any online resources for biostatistics preparation or a refresher? Yes, please see the free courses that are available at http://oli.cmu.edu/ 7.Is h ealth insurance for Summer Sessions available? Please see Health Services for information on health insurance options.26 8.When do the Fall and Spring semesters begin and end? Please refer to UC Berkeley Registrar's Office website for more detail s. Fall 2021 orientation activities (\"Welcome Days\") are planned for late August 20 21. Mo re information about these activities and other important information will be coming to you soon via email from the School of Public Health Student Services office. 9.Ho w can I satisfy the 42 units for the Interdisciplinary Program in just eleven months? The two -year MPH programs require that you complete 48 units in two years, where as th e 11-month MPH programs require 42 units in 11 months. The Interdisciplinary program is rigorous but doable, provided you are not working or have other time - intensive obligations. We will provide a list of possible curriculum scenarios at thebeginning of the Summer Session. 10.W hat is the minimum number of units that I may to take each semes ter? The minimum allowable number of units per semester is 12. However, as an Interdisciplinary student, you will need to take many more units each semester. 11.C an I transfer of units from previous graduate coursework not counted towards another degree? You may be able to transfer up to four units of graduate level coursework towards your MPH degree. According to UC Berkeley's Graduate Division Policy: \"A master 's stu dent may transfer up to four semester units or six quarter units of course work completed as a graduate student at another institution. The units must be equivalent tocourses in the student's graduate program at Berkeley, and the student must have received at least a B in the course(s) and have a grade point average of at least 3.3.\" The courses to be transferred must be approved by the School of Public Health CurriculumReview Committee to insure that they meet the requirements for transfer. Studen ts m ust submit a syllabus for each course. Eligible units might be stand-alone courses or courses taken that exceeded the requirements (extra units) for a previous degree . D etailed procedures for transferring units will be announced at the start of the Fall semester. 12.D o I take PH297, the field practicum requirement that is listed on some UC Berkele y Sc hool of Public Health MPH curriculum materials? No-- this course is for two-year MPH students only. As an 11-month student, you satisfy your practicum requirement as part of the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 InterdisciplinaryMPH Seminars -- PH 292(12) and PH 292(7) in the Spring . 13.T he Interdisciplinary Seminars \u2014PH 292 in Fall and PH 292 -- in the Spring are variable unit courses. How many units should I enroll in for each of these courses? 4 units for each course, taken for a letter grade. This is the equivalent to 180 hours of work per semester.27 14.Can I take undergraduate courses and can they count towards my 42 units? How many undergraduate units can I take? Yes, you may t ake undergraduate courses and they will count towards the MPH, bu t th ey must be upper division courses numbered 100 or above. You may take a maximum of 12 units in 100-level courses. 15.H ow many elective units can I take outside the UCB School of Public Health? There is no limit on the number of elective units that may be taken outside SPH acro ss o ther UCB department s. 16.C an I complete one of the public health specialty areas along with t he interdisciplinary MPH?Yes. You may use elective units in the Interdisciplinary curriculum to complete specialty area requirements such as for the Global Health Specialty Area. 17.M ay I take courses Pass/Fail or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory? All required c ourses must be taken for a letter grade. You may take electives as S/U, but no more than a third of your total units taken can be taken S/U (excluding independentstudy courses numbered 299) . 18.W hat are the guidelines for taking independent study (299) uni ts? The maximum number of PH 299 course units you may take towards the degree is ten . P H 299's can be taken either S/U or for a letter grade. The choice depends on what you arrange with the instructor . Al though no more than one third of total units can be taken S/U, this one third doe s N OT include PH 299 units. 19.A s a UCB student, do I get access to STATA for data analysis? You have free access to STATA on the computers in the Epi/Biostat computer lab. Youcan also buy your own copy of STATA at a discount . Please see : h ttp://www.stata.com/order/new/edu/gradplans/campus- gradplan/ 20.A s a UCSF resident, can I receive the two -thirds tuition and fee reduction available to UC staff? Unfortunately you cannot. To receive this discount, you may take no more than nine units of coursework per semester. The Interdisciplinary Program requires that you takemore than nine units per semester. 21.W hen will I be presented with a financial aid package for this program? Are there financial support options that I should consider looking into? While the School of Public Health has a variety of merit and need-based scholarships/fellowships, there is no guarantee that a newly admitted graduate will be a recipient of an award. As of right now, SPH scholarship/funding award letters have been sent out, but that does not necessarily mean all opportunities have been exhausted!28 In addition to fellowships/scholar ships offered through SPH, it is common for students to look into external scholarships and/or federal loans. With regards to financial aid packages, which consist of loan allocations, as well as any grants one may be eligible for, UC Berkeley's Financial Aid & Scholarships Office will notify newly admitted graduates of these opportunities around late April/early May, but only if the Statement of Intent to Register is submitted. In th e meantime, I would highly encourage you to look at the different ways to fund your education. Another thing to note is that there will be more opportunities, such as GSI/GSR- ships and other internal scholarships, which you can apply for through our SPH jobsite. Enclosed please find a \" Tips for Finding GSI_GSR \". Also, as a member of the Association for Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH), our graduate students have access to funding resources such as \"Tips and Tricks to Obtaining Scholarships\" and external sources that are based on specific qualifying criteria (e.g., race, gender, state of residency, etc.): Tips and Tricks to Obtaining Scholarships (http://www.aspph.org/study/financing- your -degree/) How to Finance Your Public Health Degree (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMRiom7Elmg webinar hosted by ASPPH). 22.C an I teach and facilitate a De -Cal course to undergraduates and receive unit credit for it? Yes. You can receive unit credit via undergraduate independent study 199 units. For information please see http://www.decal.org/ 23.I f I need to book a room to use for a student meeting, project interview, etc., how can I do so? You may ask Deanine Johnson - email her at ipmph@berkeley.edu , and please give her at least several days' notice to find the room. 24.

Enrollment in courses in many departments and schools is restricted to students in those schools. B oalt School of Law, the Goldman School of Public Policy, and the Haas School of Business have specific procedures allowing students from outside those schools to enroll in courses. Those procedures follow below and on the next several pages. B OALT SCHOOL OF LAW Note: Classes in the Law School start 2 weeks early. Y ou cannot just enroll via CalCentral - you need to use a separate procedure to apply to enroll in a law school course. Complete this form . If you have any other questions, please call Boalt Law School Student Services - 510 643- 2744.31 GOLDMAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY Elective courses are open to all students and you can get onto the waitlist by enrollin g vi a CalCentral. Core courses are restricted and not open to students outside Goldman unless allowed by the professor teaching the course. Look in http://catalog.berkeley.edu for electives open to all. Also, the UCB online schedule http://schedule.berkeley.edu will tell you if the course is restricted . S tudents are advised to talk with the instructor on the first day of class to request to be added to course. H AAS BUSINESS SCHOOL Enrollment Process For Non -Haas Students Wishing To Take MBA Electives For one course you can register following the normal process for your other classes via CalCentral: MBA209F - Fundamentals of Business: An Introduction to Business for Graduate Students Tuesdays 6:10 - 9PM, 3 units Fundamentals of Business is a course specifically designed for graduate students in schools other than Haas (and will serve as an elective course for their degree programs). The purpose of the course is to introduce non -business students to the vocabulary of business and to understand how business people analyze problems and determine strategy. It's not quite a \"survey\" course. Rather, we cover a selection of topics in some depth as is appropriate for graduate students. Many UC Berkeley graduate students will go on to work in business and even those who continue their research careers will spend much of their professional lives interacting with business people. The course is taught in 3 five- week modules: 1. Ma rketing and Strategy 2. Accounting and Finance 3. Organizational Behavior and Management The class meets once a week, from 6:10 to 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday evenings in Fall 2021 at the Haas School; the first class meeting is Tuesday, August 24 and the last class is on Tuesday, December 7. There is no final exam; the course is examined by three take- home exams. Each module also has a required short term paper. Unlike most other MBA courses, students should enroll in MBA 209F directly, via CalCentral using the class number. Contact FTMBA Academics Team for the course control number (ftacademics@haas.berkeley.edu.ink@berkeley.edu ). 32 For all other courses at Haas Business School: If you are a graduate student in another UC Berkeley department you may take elective courses in the Full -time MBA Program, provided: You are registered for the current semester, which means that you must be enrolled in at least one course and have paid yo ur fees. There is space in the class at the end of the second week of the semester. You meet the prerequisites, if any, for the class. You submit your request(s) by the applicable deadline. Your home department or school does not offer an equivalent course. T he MBA Program does not use CalCentral to manage its course enrollments, with the exception of MBA209F - Fundamentals of Business. For all other MBA courses, we will add requested courses to your schedule if we are able to accommodate you. To request all other Haas MBA classes, you will instead use our Online Registrar system, which will open on July 5: Go to http://mbarequest.haas.berkeley.edu and log in to submit your request. Requests are not treated as first- come, first -served, so you just need to submit by the deadline The deadline to submit requests for Fall 2020 courses is 12 noon on Friday, September 4. Y ou may request up to 3 MBA courses, order them according to your preference, an d i ndicate the maximum number of courses you wish to be enrolled in. Once you enter your requests, you can edit them up until the end of the request period.

Here are students' comments. El ectives Recommended by Class of 2021 FALL PH W212: Foundation of Global Health. Instructor: Hildy F Fong, Arthur L Reingold. Self - paced with moderate readings. Well-structured course materials which introduce the fundamental concepts from public health disciplines through a creative- thinking experience. The assignments require students to apply the class learnings into the real- world global health needs. The Professors and GSI's are available to answer any questions. The course structure is engaging because there's a new theme or domain every week with occasional guest lecturers. The workload is light and manageable. Some other useful skills developed through the 34 assignments: writing policy briefs, writing a research proposal, and developing a budget. Additionally, the readings and related discussions foster critical thinking and help develop analytic skills. PH 257: Outbreak Investigations . Instructor: Arthur L Reingold. A discussion based class in which Dr. Reingold teaches the various aspects of performing outbreak investigations. Given readings each week on specific topics and \"dis cussion questions\", which are then discussed in class. Workload is very reasonable, and Dr. Reingold is very engaging in discussions. No specific assignments, quizzes, or tests. Dr. Reingold is very experienced and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to outbreak investigations. The readings assigned are a bit dated, as in general outbreak research specific to the class are difficult to come by. PH 213A: Family planning, population change, and health. Instructor: Ndola Prata. Lecture- based class with a very light workload. Several readings each week, but most are short. The course covers most of the spectrum of family- planning with a global focus, including the design and implementation of programs in various countries. Experienced guest lecturers bring i n different perspectives. There is substantial freedom to choose the topic of the final paper and it can also be used to develop one's Capstone project. P H 290.002: Social justice and worker health. Instructors: Suzanne Teran and Diane E Bush. Course use s innovative teaching methods to keep students engaged throughout the three- hour - long class. Readings are long and heavy, but the workload is not. All assignments involve the application of learnings from class and develop analytical and writing skills. Th e group work for the class is paced well making it easier for students. Has a lot of experienced guest speakers, including workers and activists. P H 211/LAW 2646: Health and Human Rights. Instructors: Eric Stover & Rohini Haar. This is by far one of the most interesting courses I've ever taken - it was so thoughtful, well-adapted to virtual learning, and fascinating. The professors have incredible professional experience and are very driven by student engagement. The diversity of guest speakers is impressi ve - we learned from NYT reporters, practitioners working with trafficking and torture victims, and leaders in human rights research. The course requires a 30- page paper (topic of your choice) to be submitted at the end of the semester - beyond that, there are really no other deliverables. However, it is expected that you carefully read all assigned literature and come prepared to share your thoughts in class. It is well worth the work and a great class. PH 210: Foundations of MCH Policy. Instructor: Cassi e Marshall, PhD. This class does a phenomenal job of linking theory, application, and action. Dr. Marshall structures the course in such a way that you see how MCAH came to be, how it has changed, and where it is going. She brings in terrific speakers that expose you to real examples of people changing MCAH policy including Expecting Justice's team (Links to an external site.), experts on ACEs, and Alameda County's head of Public Health. Dr. Marshall is an engaging lecturer and utilizes a variety of tools to make the class engaging and seems to spin magic in the form of community building. Workload: There is a mix of small assignments throughout the course that includes introductory videos, informal recordings of an issue you are passionate about, a TED ta lk style 35 in-class presentation, and two short papers. The assignments build on one another and are scaffolded well so that things never become overwhelming. Readings include collaborative weekly comments that transform the act of reading for class from boring to an opportunity to clarify content and learn from peers. The only class I did all the reading for. P H 220E Global Health Policy. Instructor: Stefano Bertozzi. The small course is a case-based group workshop approach to implementing global health policies. The four cases we looked at were designing a universal health coverage benefits package, international pandemic response, conditional cash -transfer program, and soda tax. The idea is not to give you an overview of global health, but rather to plac e you in the position of a consultant to a government or NGO trying to solve a health problem. Dr. Bertozzi is an exceptionally dedicated instructor with tons of experience. He tries to get to know you personally and is invested in improving your presentation and research skills and helping you network for jobs. He brings in speakers from the Gates Foundation, foreign and domestic governmental health organizations, the WHO, World Bank, etc. The course is a fair amount of work (~6-8 hours per week outside of class) but it is steady throughout the semester without a final or midterm exam. SPRING PH 254: Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology. Instructors: Ellen Eisen and Sadie Costello. The class is mainly discussion-based and consists of weekly journal article critiques, covering various topics of occupational and environmental hazards and methods of analysis. The class would then discuss the critiques as a large group each week. The workload was higher than some classes, since you had to read a journal article and fill out the critique form each week, but I felt that I learned a lot about how to critically analyze papers. Some of the concepts were complex, though the instructors would give lectures at times, going over the concepts. As for grading, th ere were 4 critique forms that we needed to turn in for grades, and there was also a final group project in which we selected two articles and had to give a presentation comparing and contracting them. After taking their class, I feel my critical thinking skills and ability to evaluate a scientific article have greatly improved. The workload is very manageable. PH 201E Public Health Interventions: Theory, Practice, and Research. Instructors: Neuhauser, Linda and Syme, Leonard. A super -fun, thought -provokin g, truly interdisciplinary class that encourages one to think of novel public health interventions with a new perspective. The workload is quite low with students having to do some background research, design, and present their idea for a public health int ervention for a topic of their choice. Other than this group project, there's just a short essay to give feedback on the class itself. There are guest lecturers every week and each session is more intriguing than the last. The instructors are encouraging a nd respectful, and so talented at class facilitation. As grounded as they are, their combined experience is truly mind- blowing. If you're interested in designing public health interventions, I would strongly recommend this class. 36 PUBAFF 290 Design Thinking for Policymakers. Instructor: Josie Innamorato. This was a half- semester 1 -unit course offered through the Goldman School of Public Policy. The course is designed as a series of workshops meant to engage policymakers through design thinking and putting participants at every step of the solution process. This class was one of the most wonderful and useful courses I took during my year because it was practical, engaging, and thought -provoking. The final project has you create a design- thinking proposal that is based off your current work or projects (great for your capstone!). The instructor, Josie Innamorato was great at facilitating the course and providing concrete feedback. The class size is capped at 15, because of the participation/discussion- based nat ure of the material. The course meets once a week for 2hrs. There are no required readings, but they are useful to do if you want to get the most out of the course. Outside of class there were assignments that usually took about 30min-1hr per week. The amo unt of work seemed a little much for a 1unit course, but it only lasted half a semester and the skills I took away were invaluable. PB 266B Zoonotic Disease. Instructor: Peter Dailey. 2 units. This class focuses on major zoonoses and their life cycle, disease manifestations, epidemiology, and methods for prevention and control. There is a heavy emphasis on One Health, for those interested in the topic. As someone interested in One Health, this course is the best one I've found in the public health school t hat truly integrates the One Health approach throughout the entire semester, rather than having it simply mentioned once during a random lecture. Each week has a different guest lecturer from a variety of different backgrounds/careers. Examples include wil dlife veterinarian, state/local public health workers, USAID, researchers, etc. Topics discussed included anti -microbial resistance, dengue, malaria, outbreak investigation, tabletop response exercise, and rabies. There is an emphasis on discussion and participation. The readings for the class can get somewhat overwhelming, as there are often 4-5 papers assigned per week and sometimes they are very technical. The papers are provided mostly for background knowledge so that you can participate thoughtfully in discussion. Other large assignments include a group class presentation and a take home final. If you are interested in zoonotic disease and/or One Health, this is a fun overview course. P H 210B Adolescent Health (Taken as an Independent Study Seminar). Instructor: Julie Deardorff. A group of us approached Julie about taking the course asynchronously as it was given on Friday afternoon in conflict with 292's seminar. Julie graciously offered to allow us to take as a 1-hour seminar together where she would lead discussions about the previous week's material and give access to the lecture recordings and readings. In non- Zoom times if given in conflict this would likely not be feasible, but the course itself was wonderful. Julie brings many paradigm -shifting insights about the strengths, motivations, and current issues in adolescent development. She had exceptional speakers and was able to moderate discussions that did not shy away from the deep or complicated issues. P H 223C Strategic Management and the Health Sector. Instructor: Kim MacPherson. Taken to fulfill the required leadership course, this class focused intensely on the business/management strategy side of Healthcare. It was interesting to work alongside many MBA/MPH folks. While it can be uncomfortable to think about the consumer/client side of health care delivery in terms of business success it felt important to learn about how all aspects of this world can work 37 together. The business buzzwords were a little alienating at times because that isn't my background, but Kim and the class were very helpful. The workload was not too arduous, but there were a few larger group projects, including working with real local businesses (hospital systems, startups, etc) working on strategy projects. My team worked with a teletherapy company looking to scale cross -licensing for their therapists on their platform. It was fun to work on a school project that had immediate real world application.

To improve knowledge about workplace toxins/heavy metals. A large number of visiting lectures who may have been one of the first people to submit a case report/series on a particular compound. Fantastic course. PH 270C Practical Toxicology Get into toxicology or pr esent a poster with assistance. Develop a poster as a group and present it at the NorCal Society of Toxicology meeting as the main 41 portion of your grade. Half the time there is free food. The poster took a long time, but it was worth it. PH 200F Environme ntal Health Online I liked the topic/lectures and the variety of assignments. Doing a group project with people in a number of different countries/time zones that have different availability than you. Way too much work for a 2- unit course. Take the in person class unless you have a light spring semester P H 142W Intro to Biostats (Online) Great lectures. Well thought out. Much better teaching on use of R than Fall in person class. Problem sets were not all R and multiple examples were in the reader. Study at their own pace and don't mind doing Zoom/skype office hours. Second half of course had lectures and problem sets not being posted until over halfway through the week. Too late in the program for biostats to be useful in Capstone. U GBA 192T Edible Education 101 About the food system and how to take action and improve our food system. Great, well known guest lecturers like Alice Waters. Class challenges you to apply what you learn and take action in your daily life.

Also got to stay up to date on the latest outbreaks, like measles, and how the CDPH handles outbreak cases. PH 281 Public Health and Spirituality How spirituality relates to the public health field. This class is ultimately based on how well group discussions go since there is no lecture and everyt hing is group discussions. Light - 1 final paper, 1 weekly 1 page reflection.

Grades are heavily determined by three exams which doesn't account for the investment in homework and readings. P H 210B - Adolescent Health Students can do a real project. Multi- disciplinary view of the target population. Great presenters. P H 216A - Biologica l Embedding of Social Factors Great discussions on the science behind social determinants of health.

You gain on -the-job experience and practice. Great for health professionals. P H 218B - Evaluation of Health and Social Programs Reading is a little heavy but the instructor does a very thorough job of how to conduct good program evaluations with real community partners. Expect a big workload with your evaluation plan for a community partn er. P H 269E - Current Topics in Environmental Medicine There's a student presentation at the end. P H 257 - Outbreak Investigation Some of the readings are old but Professor Reingold is smart and entertaining. Light work load.

It can be intimidating at times but was a great experience overall. The projects at the end is long and time consuming. P H 226A - Health Economics Decent amount of overlap with HPM breadths but definitely added information. In -depth he alth insurance discussion. 43 P H 129 - The Aging Human Brain Light reading and interesting material. SPRING P H 200A - Current Issues in Public Health Ethics: Research and Practice This is a very challenging but stimulating course and so critical for any one in public health. Highly recommend the professor Jodi Halpern and the class size of about 18 students. P H 201E - Public Health Interventions: Theory, Practice, and Research This was a great course, almost like a think tank, which included lots of disc ussion and student driven presentations. Definitely would recommend for any public health student, though especially for those in the Interdisciplinary program like clinicians or those who work in medical settings and want to learn more about creative approaches to the hardest public health problems. P H W209 - Comparative Health Systems This is a must take online class for people interested in global health and health policy. It's hard to balance the course load if it's offered on the second half of a regu lar semester. P H 255A - Social Epidemiology This course covers equity issues through a social determinants of health lens. P H W226C - Economics of Population Health This is an online course and covers the policy side of social equity issues. PubPol 103 - Wealth and Poverty One becomes a better person out of taking Robert Reich's class. It is very difficult to get into this course though. P H 271C - Drinking Water and Health This course is excellent for those who are interested in water- related project s and how they impact public health. Heavy on reading and expectations but Prof. Smith makes it fun with her innovative jigs - Jeopardy, Movie, interesting case studies (Flint Michigan, Salinas Valley and more), visit to Orinda water treatment plant, stake holder discussion forum, term paper, and quizzes - all rolled into one. El ectives Recommended by Class of 2017 FALL P H 203A - Theories of Health and Social Behavior.

PH 220D - Health Policy Advocacy. Best for students who want to learn really practical and applicable skills in pol icy and advocacy. Harry Snyder and Tony Iton are amazing! They shift the discussion according to the needs of the students. Great mentorship from professors. Engage in conversation rather than lecture. They expect you to know the readings very well. Work l oad goes up and down but is manageable. The policy plan is a lot of work but definitely worth it. PH 223F - Effective Public Health Negotiations. Manageable workload but lots of outside prep. Learn practical negotiation skills in healthcare settings. Almo st all practice scenarios. Learn how to better your own negotiation style.

Dan Mulhern is incredibly invested in his students. The course gives you the structure and accountability to work on yoursel f and your vision/leadership goals with as much help from Dan as you need. You have to be personally interested in self -development and have the personality to learn from different perspectives. Some students struggled with this. MBA 292N - Social Impact Metrics. Good practical skills for working with non -profits. Practice consulting. Case studies are very relevant and practical. Engaging professors and guest lecturers.

You get introduced to a whole new way of thinking so that we don't keep repeating the same mistakes or making vast assumptions. Lots of reading -60 pages per week. P H 204 - Mass Communication and Public Health. Significant workload - 405 hours per week of reading, large semester-long project, and other assignments. Helps us understand how to use media to advance PH. Learning a real skill set - practical and you actually practice skills you're learning. More work than my other classes - probably should be 4 units rather than 3. I learned more in this class than any other class. I heard from alumni and this was very valuable and useful. Lori Dorfman is an amazing instructor who inspires her student s to take action. Writing an op -ed and letter to the editor as an assignment was a highlight. The group project was tough but it still wouldn't deter me from the experience. Time intensive but learned the most SKILLS so far! Good guest lecturers. Lots of r eading and assignments. PH 206 Core Nutrition Topics. Good background for any student. Barbara Laraia is super nice and laid back. Topics are interesting, self-directed topics are great.

How to take a PH issue and come up with an advocacy plan to address it. Great guest speakers and group discussion with manageable workload. If you don't like group discussion and speaking up in class, this course probably isn't for you unless you're trying to develop these skills. A great class for thinking about leadership and how to be a force for positive change in your community. Pretty leisurely. Learn about policy advocacy, coalition building, capacity building. Discussions were thoughtful, guest lectures were incredible, and students brought snacks! Not a lot of direction about final project until the end. P H 224 - Healthcare Management. Take any class with Professor Hector Rodriguez! PH 226D Global Health Economics. Great speakers. Learn how healthcare systems work. P H 224D - Health Organizations and Management.

Instructor is very friendly and enthusiastic and engages the class very well. Is heavily theory based but with concrete examples. 48 PH 235 - Impact Evaluation. Weekly STATA assig nments and major course project. Learn methods for evaluating impact of program or intervention. Instructors do great job of explaining material with real examples. This was the first year with STATA, which was not so good. But will likely improve. A fair amount of reading and almost weekly problem sets (3 -4 hours each) and major final paper. Overall, an above -average workload. Best features: thinking through all the logistical challenges of designing an impact evaluation was really useful,. Also, some sp eakers talked about the future of impact evaluation, which was interesting. It's a lot of time if you're designing a hypothetical evaluation. You learn to write a grant, design randomized control trials and do an impact evaluation. Taught by Paul Gertler and Jack Colford-- two big shots. Homework is intense. Impact evaluation is a specific program evaluation tool - it's excellent. Learn about impact evaluation - different methods and designing a study. Good class textbook and project. STATA homework not so great. Great knowledge based on real world examples and study design. A lot of STATA -- some took MANY hours. Pretty time intensive. Great lectures about components of impact evaluation, pretty theoretical. STATA homework took more time than the 1 unit t hat is allotted. PH 240 - Community Needs Assessment in Maternal and Child Health. Heavy workload. You will be paired with a community group or member and actually do a CNA or related project. If you don't have an MPH project, you could use this class to partner with an organization and work ono your year -long project. The teacher was a bit distracted and not well prepared with good class activities. Grading criteria very unclear. PH245 - Multivariate Statistics. Four homework assignments plus a final project --- overall, a light work load. Best for students who want more advanced stats knowledge and computing skills. Class is very useful and practical \u2014you can apply skills to your project. First time this professor taught the course and it was a bit more confusing than it could have been. Great for learning different multivariate tools. Few mandatory homework assignments (4 total) plus one final project. Does not go too into depth. New lecturer -- feels like he's stil l working on his teaching style, but is open to feedback. Could use more real world examples. PH 250B -Epidemiological Methods II. Tough, quick -paced, weekly optional homework, many readings. You get more in -depth coverage of study design and general epi . Great lecturer, well organized, you learn a lot. It may be too in -depth for students not that interested in epi. PH 253 - Global Public Health Core Course. Readings interesting but did not have to do them. Good workload - 2 policy papers and a group pr oject. Built around several issues in Global Health. I enjoyed all the different perspectives and presenters and group discussions. It took a while to get our first assignment back and comments came just before the next assignment, but it was still OK. Lo ts of good speakers and info. PH 256 -City Planning and Healthy Cities. A lot of reading - ~100 pages per week and required online responses. Also, big paper at end. Good for students interested in social justice. The readings were really interesting, di verse and important. The students are a smart bunch. But the professor isn't good at stimulating a lively debate. 49 PH 260A - Introduction to Infectious Diseases. Medium load and required intermediate knowledge of virology and immunology. Best for students who need comprehensive knowledge of infectious diseases. Very organized and comprehensive about infection - it includes etiology, epidemiology, clinical features, treatment, and prevention of almost all infectious diseases. Not so great for MDs - would probably be repeated in medical school. P H 290(4) - Health Communication in the Digital Era. Leisurely pace; weekly blog posts for the class website. Learn how to effectively use social media, start a blog, use multimedia in the public health sphere. I learned a lot and experimented with Twitter, making videos , and class blog posts. The pace was slow and it could have been a little deeper. Teachers for the course listen to feedback and made changes based on class concerns. You get to be creative! Great teachers (Diego and Lisa). Some projects, e.g., video production, take a lot of time. P H 290(6) - Healthcare Quality. Workload is 5 -8 hours per week, depending o n internship commitment. Taught by COO of SF General - gives solid intro to how to improve healthcare processes and deepens policy background greatly. You do internship at SF General or other organization to practice real work skills. Internship is time consuming. Really special class for clinicians or those interested in process improvement, future COOs, people who want to work at SF General. A lot of reading, two papers, class group project.

El ectives Recommended by Class of 2014 FALL P H 201C - Needs Assessment in Maternal and Child Health : Best for students who want to learn about program planning. Not much weekly course work but there is a semester- long project. Small seminar group, community involvement. You have to do a project - time consuming but rewarding.

Community Partne r Liaison __________________________ _________________________ S tudent(s)____________________________________________________________________________ U CB Interdisciplinary MPH Program Faculty Anke Hemmerling Karen Sokal- Gutierrez 57 Literature Review Guidelines for MPH Project (due TBA) Purpose: The literature review will inform you of the body of research relating to the topic of your project. The best literature reviews are those that contextualize the project and its importance to public health, and discuss the shortcomings and successes of existing research to address similar questions/needs. For your reference, you can browse through several sample MPH project reports of recent years in your handbook, or browse through MPH pro ject reports of recent years and samples for the literature reviews, all are posted on BCourses. Length and format: Approximately 5 - 8 pages, double -spaced Outline: Literature reviews should use the following outline: I. Title II. Abstract III. Introduction Describe the importance of the topic, both broadly and with respect to the specific population(s) served by your project, in a style appropriate for academic settings. IV. Main themes in the literature This must reflect synthesis across sources as opposed to straightforward linear summaries of identified relevant articles. V. Conclusions/lessons from the literature i. Summarize the lessons from the literature ii. Identify what is still lacking in the literature VI. Reflection on applicat ion of literature to, and implications for, planned project VII. Bibliography Be sure to include proper referencing of all cited sources. (e.g. AMA style https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/ama_style/index.html ; AJPH; or other styles from peer reviewed journals in the field). 58 C PHS (IRB) - Ethical Review of your Project Pl an ahead - Many researchers are on set schedules for their research and theses. Plan in advance to allow enough time for the review cycle which can take some time depending on the circumstances. Review cycles, depending on the quality and completeness of the submis sion, can take up to 8 weeks or longer. Se ek feedback from colleagues - Student researchers should work with their faculty advisors closely for mentoring, drafting, and other assistance with the research protocol. Obtain a copy of an approved protocol from a colleague to see commonly used language. C omplete/comprehensive informed consent process - Researchers should ensure that the consent documents are clear and concise and should be in a language that is understandable to the subject. See the Informed Consent Guidelines, Consent Builder, and templates on our website (http://cphs.berkeley.edu/content/informedconsent.html). C learly describe study procedures - Remember that the reviewer needs to be able to put him/herself in the shoes of the subject and they can't do that if there is not enough detail. The protocol should include how long each procedure will take, frequency, a nd estimated total time commitment for the subject to participate in the study. C onfidentiality - Privacy refers to the individuals' right to control access to themselves. On the other hand, confidentiality refers to how private information provided by individuals will be protected by the researcher from release. Describing how the confidentiality of research information will be maintained is an important element of the protocol & consent process. A nonymous data collection - Anonymous data collection means that no identifiable information (e.g., name, address, student ID number, email, phone number, etc.) is connected to the data either directly or through a coding system, at any point in the study. Therefore , even if the identifiers are separated from the data immediately after collection, the study would not be considered anonymous. In addition to videotapes and photographs, audio recordings are considered to be identifiable; therefore any data collection that involves audio recordings, video recordings, or photographs of subjects would not be considered anonymous. It is also possible that multiple pieces of information, none of which are identifiable on their own, may uniquely identify a person when brought together; in this case, the data would be identifiable and would not be considered anonymous. R isks/discomforts from study participation - Remember to include both the possible risks and discomforts from participation in the study. With all studies that involve the collection of private identifiable information, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised. However, researchers should also keep in mind that some procedures, including surveys and lab experiments with deception might cause some type of discomfort (whether physical or 59 emotional). When making a risk assessment, the Committee takes into account both probability and magnitude of harm, so researchers should address both of these factors in the protocol. Guidance on specific topics - There are guidance documents on specific topics that may be germane to your research - what requires CPHS/OPHS review, deception in research, subject recruitment, data security, research, etc. (http://cphs.berkeley.edu/guideline.html) eProtocol http://cphs.berkeley.edu/eprotocolguide/investigator/create.pdf How to check for completeness: http://cphs.berkeley.edu/eprotocolguide/investigator/check.pdf How to submit a protocol: http://cphs.berkeley.edu/eprotocolguide/investigator/submit.pdf How comments: http://cphs.berkeley.edu/eprotocolguide/investigator/comments.pdf Questions?

Year 2021 Title Abstract Assessing intentions to vaccinate against SARS - CoV-2 and examining perceptions of and obstacles to SARS -CoV-2 vaccination among adults living in Lebanon with a cross -sectional, online, mobile study The COVID -19 pandemic is an additional burden on Lebanon's strained population, fragmented healthcare system, and political, economic, and refugee crises. Understanding the population's intentions to vaccinate and perceptions of and obstacles to SARS -CoV-2 vaccination can inform and improve Lebanon's vaccination efforts and relieve the pandemic's impact. We performed a cross -sectional study using an online, remotely delivered questionnaire in Arabic via convenience \"snowball\" sampling to rapidly assess the perceptions of 1,185 adu lts residing in Lebanon in Jan- Mar 2021. 46.1% of survey participants intended to take the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine when available to them, 19.0% indicated that they would not, and 34.0% were unsure. The most common reasons for hesitancy were concerns about safe ty, limited testing, side effects, and efficacy. We recommend disseminating clear, consistent, evidence -based safety and efficacy information on vaccines on the most commonly reported news sources by participants: television, social media, and news website s. Repeated assessments of intentions to vaccinate, concerns or obstacles regarding vaccination, and changes in motivations should be performed, especially to assess the perspectives and needs of populations underrepresented in this study. The impact of distance learning on physical activity, mental health, and learning among 4th graders during the COVID - 19 pandemic. Background: Prior to the pandemic, childhood obesity and the associated increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders in adulthood were a concern, especially in children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) households. New reports are now also showing that the coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19) pandemic is affecting the educational performance and mental health of children. Objective: The objective of this study is to describe changes in health habits, learning and emotional wellbeing of 4th graders' distance learning d uring the COVID -19 pandemic compared to in person learning in an under resourced district. Methods: We conducted a survey of fourth- graders between 4 Dec 2020 and 5 February 2021. Inclusion criteria were any registered 4th graders (9 - 10 years old) in the San Pablo School district for the 2020 - 2021 academic year. Seventy -four fourth- graders were enrolled in the overarching study. Two self -administered surveys were used to assess perceived benefits and challenges of distance learning on physical health, m ental health, and learning. Students were asked about their habits related to diet, physical activity, sleep, and hydration. Questions also focused on mental health and their learning experience. Summary and chi -square statistics were used in analysis. Results: Fourth graders report that they experience more enjoyment in learning, are more physically active, and are happier when learning at school. In contrast, they are 66 more distracted, consume more junk food, and have more non -educational screen time while distance learning compared to in school learning. Students were asked if they were worried that they or a family member would catch COVID -19. Out of the 46 respondents, 78% are worried that a family member will become infected with COVID -19, and 56% are worried that they will also become ill. This cohort was also surveyed on frequency of anxiety, worry, depression, joy, and hope within the last week. While 50% experienced hope and joy on a daily basis, it is worth noting that many students reported feel ing daily anxiety/nervousness (32%), loneliness (26%), depressed feelings (14%), and were unable to stop worrying (11%). Analysis using chi -square statistics determined that self -reported anxiety (p = 0.25) and depression (p = 0.10) was not related to worr y about the pandemic. The rate of reported anxiety and depression is also supported by the elevated average Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ score of 19.8). Conclusions: Children reported decreased learning and increased distractions while learning from home. The reduction in physical activity and increase in processed food consumption is concerning given the increased obesity prevalence among school children before the COVID -19 pandemic. Survey findings highlight students' concern about the mselves and family members getting ill, but was not significantly associated with the depressive symptoms or anxiety reported. However, the prevalence of reported feelings of depression and anxiety among school children is concerning and needs to be addres sed by the community. Recovery and Resilience in the Canal Community: An In -Depth Analysis of Economic Impacts and Solutions During the Covid -19 Pandemic Background: Public health pandemics, such as Covid -19, not only impact the physical health and wellb eing of communities, but often have far -reaching effects on their social, psychological, environmental, and economic welfare. The Coronavirus Pandemic has highlighted the significant inequities experienced among those who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), especially in the areas of housing instability, unemployment, and debt accrual. This study investigates the socioeconomic impacts of Covid -19 on residents of the Canal neighborhood (\"The Canal\"), a low -income Latinx community in Marin Cou nty, California. This study also uplifts mitigation strategies already underway to facilitate post -pandemic recovery efforts. Methods: This study utilized a mixed- methods, community participatory approach in which community leaders from a local nonprofit, Canal Alliance, administered a survey assessing the impact of Covid -19 on Canal residents. Additionally, community stakeholders including nonprofits, small businesses, and public officials were interviewed, and their field notes were analyzed through explo ratory open coding. Results: On a macro level, the data showed that Canal residents were severely impacted by Covid -19 in the form of massive job loss (61.2% of respondents were unemployed or under employed) as well as financial stress related to eviction, housing instability and debt accrual (78.8% of respondents struggled to cover rent and often had to borrow money from friends and family). Conclusions: In spite of the severe socioeconomic impacts of Covid- 19 on The Canal, there is significant opportunit y for recovery and growth because of an overwhelming investment by residents, community -based organizations, and public officials to support those who have been financially impacted by the pandemic. Some key areas of policy focus include expansion of affor dable housing, pandemic -resistant workforce development, and restructuring of social services to increase accessibility. This report will explore recommendations related to strategic funding of community -based programs as well as short term and long term s olutions for economic recovery. Advancing Universal Health Coverage: Models, Policy Analysis 67 Strategies, And Outcomes In Four Countries Objectives: 1) Describe Universal Health Coverage including history, concept, scope and importance, methods to monitor and measure progress, and criticisms. 2) Analyze policy strategies to achieve Universal Health Coverage in four countries representing four differen t UHC approaches - Rwanda, Thailand, Japan, United Kingdom (England). 3) Compare outcomes of Universal Health Coverage in four countries - Rwanda, Thailand, Japan, United Kingdom (England) Studied the process of adopting UHC and the subsequent outcomes in four countries to share learnings for other nations on a similar path. These countries differ in not just their geographies, culture, history, income categories and sociodemographic indicators, but also in how they administer their UHC programs and utiliz e existing resources for the same. Their health systems also represent different levels of maturity, having established UHC policies at different times. COVID -19 Contact Tracing and Barriers to Quarantine Among Sexual and Gender Minorities: A Pilot Proje ct This qualitative pilot project aims to characterize and understand the experiences of sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and identify barriers they may have with contact tracing and vaccine uptake in the context of COVID -19. Minority populations have demonstrated unique vulnerabilities and barriers to accessing resources in the context of COVID -19 infection or contacts, and there is a lack of data specifically concerning SGM communities. The aims of this research are threefold: 1) To understand how the c ontact tracing process is perceived by LGBT individuals (both cases and contacts) and how this perception impacts information sharing with public health workers; 2) To identify barriers to effective information -sharing, and quarantining, as well as to cons ider attitudes towards vaccine uptake and 3) To develop recommendations for improving the contact tracing process for LGBT individuals affected by COVID -19. The Effects of Telemedicine Visit Type and Patient -Provider Familiarity on Orders in Primary Care Introduction: Telemedicine is increasingly relied upon for care delivery in primary care, but the effect of visit type on clinical ordering behavior is uncert ain. Methods: Within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we identified patients who scheduled and completed telemedicine encounters in adult primary care between April 1st, 2020, and October 31st, 2020, while physical distancing restrictions for COVID -19 were in place. We collected patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as measures of technology access, and categorized the most common primary encounter diagnoses within our cohort. We then compared physician orders for medications , lab and imaging studies within eight diagnosis groups (Skin & Soft Tissue, Musculoskeletal Pain, Back Pain, General Gastrointestinal, Hypertension & Diabetes, Mental Health, Upper Respiratory, and Abdominal Pain) by visit type, video versus telephone, as well as by patient -provider familiarity. Results: There were 273,301 included encounters, with 122,051 (58.5%) telephone visits and 86,676 (41.5%) video visits. After adjusting for covariates, there was a significant overall increase in probability of or ders of all types during video visits compared to telephone visits. The largest effect within diagnosis groups was for Skin & Soft Tissue conditions, where there was a 9.0% increased probability of medication orders during video visits (45.5%, CI 43.8 -46.8) compared to telephone visits (36.5% CI 34.8- 37.7). There was also a significantly increased probability of diagnostic orders, and a decrease in antibiotic medication orders, during visits with familiar compared to unfamiliar clinicians. Discussion: We o bserved small but significant differences in clinician orders by visit type and patient -provider familiarity during primary care telemedicine encounters. Qualitative Study: Community Perspectives This paper uses qualitative methods to explore the perspectives of members of the Re - Imagine L.A. County coalition on crisis response in LA County. Open -ended interviews 68 on Community -Based Crisis Response Alternatives in LA Coun ty were conducted with 13 community organizations to examine how their organization currently handles crisis and to ask about their views on public safety and the characteristics of crisis interventions that would align with coalition members' visions of safety. Transcripts were also analyzed for emergent themes that were then organized into the buckets of handling crisis and public safety perspectives. For handling crisis, participants discussed alternatives to calling the police, advocating for clients when the police are involved, and the need for non -violent, non -traumatic, and non- lethal physical interventions. When asked about public safety, participants challenged conventional notions of public safety and talked about various ways of creating true safety in their communities, including innovations in crisis response that sounded promis ing to them. From the interviews, a list of criteria emerged for participants' ideal crisis response and prevention, with a strong leaning for systems based on self -determination. The findings of this study support the need to fund community -based crisis i nterventions that operate independently from police or the 911 system. Mental Health Conditions Among Essential Workers at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital During the Covid -19 Pandemic Since the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) was declared a global pandemic, the World Health Organization has issued multiple statements a nticipating a concomitant rise in psychological stressors. Several studies have shown the prevalence of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, among nurses and physicians involved in the initial mitigation response against COVID -19, but limited data exists on the mental health impact that this pandemic has had on non -clinical staff members designated as essential workers. To characterize the psychological impact of the COVID -19 global pandemic on essential workers, a cross -section study was conducted by gathering anonymous surveys from 1,171 of 6,637 eligible clinical and non -clinical essential workers at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (ZSFG), the largest public hospital operated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, from July 22, 2020 to September 2, 2020. Respondents were mostly female (73.8%), median age 40 (IQR: 33, 50), predominantly nurses (33.7%), and Asian (47.7%) or White (38.4%). Using physicians as the reference group, severe depressive symptoms were significantly higher among nurses (aOR 1.93, 95% CIs 1.12 - 3.46), social service employees (aOR 2.61, 95% CIs 1.35 - 5.17), service workers (aOR 2.55, 95% 1.20 - 5.48), administrative staff (aOR 2.93, 95% CIs 1.57 - 5.61). When measuring the impact of financial strain on the relationship between job category and mental health outcomes, social service employees (aOR 2.10, 95% CIs 1.06 - 4.21) and administrative staff (aOR 2.29, 95% CIs 1.21 - 4.43) were significantly more likely than physicians to experience severe depressive symptoms. This study contributes evidence toward the disparities of mental health impacts that COVID -19 has had on various occupational roles within the healthcare system beyond physicians and nu rsing staff. Further studies are necessary to measure the impact of suggested policies and practices to prevent poor mental health outcomes and improve overall wellness among these essential workers. An Ecological Analysis of Exposure to PM2.5 and COVID -19 Mortality in California: A Planning Project Chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with increased rates of emergency department visits, hospitalization and deaths from asthma and heart disease, and may be associated with an increased incidence and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Positive associations have also been shown between short -term exposure (i.e., weeks) to PM2.5 and the rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for influenza -like illness. Toxicologic models describing the impact of PM2.5 on lung tissue have demonstrated fre e radical injury, imbalanced intracellular calcium homeostasis, and inflammatory injury due to 69 cytokine overexpression. Recently, a positive county -level association has been found between air pollution and COVID -19 mortality in the United States and Europe. However, analysis accounting for confounders and potentially disproportionate effects on vulnerable communities has not yet been completed. Additionally, detecting an association with improved spatial refinement (i.e., to the neighborhood or census -tract level) would increase the positive public health impact to communities by providing an evidence basis for specific policy initiatives. The present study aims to bridge these gaps by examining both long -term and proximal exposure to PM2.5 in relation to C OVID -19 mortality and other important covariates including race/ethnicity, income, obesity and smoking rates, population density, segregation, and occupation. Covariate datasets will include the American Community Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil lance System, the California Health Interview Survey, CalEnviroscreen, U.S. Census, and other data as needed. Multivariate and mixed statistical models will be preformed on the data to estimate COVID -19 risk, and results will be assembled into a geographic information system (GIS) platform.

Examining the Effects of Barriers to Medication Abortion: A Scoping Review Research shows that many women prefer medication abortion to procedural abortion, and that it holds certain advantages, including confidentiality and the ability to avoid an in- clinic or surgical procedure. It is less clear what harms are caused by the inability of abortion -seeking people to access a wanted medication abortion. Laws that limit access to medication abortion in the U.S. are often enacted in the name of public health when they may be harming, rather than helping, the people they claim to protect. This scoping review assesses the extent of current research on the harms caused by barriers to medication abortion. While existing research is limite d, identified harms include frustrated demand for medication abortion; emotional harms including fear, stress and anxiety; and the potential for absolute loss of the right to abortion when procedural abortion is also unavailable. Barriers to medication abo rtion may also force people with complex reasons for avoiding procedural abortion, such as transgender people and people who have experienced intimate partner violence, to decide between a procedural abortion they do not want and abandoning their right to abortion altogether. Further research is needed to better assess the near -term outcomes and long- term impact of not being able to obtain medication abortion.

Identifying and Characterizing Risks of Zoono tic Disease USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) PREDICT program was a globally collaborative project with the aims of finding and identifying zoonotic viruses with the potential for pandemic outbreak. 70 Transmission in the Lake Zone of Tanzania This cap stone project for the Interdisciplinary MPH at UC Berkeley, is a secondary analysis of survey data gathered during PREDICT from the Lake Zone of Tanzania. Building upon the research gathered from biological specimen collection, the survey data was collecte d in collaboration with local communities regarding social and behavioral factors that might have some influence on risks of zoonotic disease transmission. PREDICT Tanzania team members administered structured surveys on behavioral risk investigations in the Lake Zone districts of Kigoma, Kyerwa, and Kibondo. The aims were to identify and characterize social, ethnographic, and behavioral beliefs and practices that influence zoonotic disease transmission in these districts. Descriptive statistics were perfo rmed and high- risk behaviors and activities for zoonotic disease spillover were characterized. Based on these findings, general recommendations for areas of intervention as well as a method for developing interventions using a human -centered design proposa l are discussed. A participatory assessment of the USDA funded Farm Fresh Food Relief Program The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity in the Bay Area and put tremendous financial strain on small businesses such as local farms. In response, the Farm Fresh Food Relief (FFFR) program was created to distribute high quality, fresh, organic produce to communities in need, while providing essential financial support to local and regional small farms. This program, centered around themes of social justice, was built on a network of farmers, food hubs, and community based organizations. It was meant to complement other emergency food programs in the community. The purpose of this evaluation is to understand how the FFFR program operated and to evaluate its impact on relevant stakeholders in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic. A program wide an alysis as well as mixed methods case studies were performed. Results from the program wide analysis revealed that FFFR distributed 56,438 produce boxes across the Bay Area and invested over $1.6 million in the community. The program financially supported o ver 57 small farmers, of which at least 22 were BIPOC owned. Case studies revealed that the FFFR model was successful in distributing food to low income, racially diverse communities. 100% of recipients reported better nutrition while receiving the boxes, and the majority (92%) reported that the boxes helped them have enough to eat. The program exemplified its value of food justice by providing fresh, high quality, culturally relevant produce for free to communities who lacked access. It promoted racial jus tice by sourcing from a large proportion of BIPOC farmers and partnering with communities of color. It encouraged economic justice by financially supporting small farms who did not have other market opportunities. This model was rooted in community network s, which build capacity for lasting change. The success of this program suggests that the USDA should consider funding for regionally based emergency food programs that focus on quality and social impact. Effects of Feeding Patterns and Dietary Exposures as A Risk to Early Childhood Caries Among 6 Months - 6 Years Children In El Salvador -A Cross -Sectional Study. Objective: To determine whether feeding patterns and dietary exposures and associated with risk of early childhood caries (ECC) among 6 months - 6 years children in El Salvador. Methods: A cross- sectional study of the sample size of 1290 children aged 6month to 6 years underwent a comprehensive dental screening consisting of 49 questionnaires were collected from the responses given by the mother of the child that studied information about the child's pattern of feeding, mother education level, brushing intake of dietary sugars and dmft status. Data analysis included bivariate analysis and logistic regression. Results: The study showed that children who were ever breastfed (95%) and ever bottled fed (44%). It was noted that there was statistical significance observed in the age of the children and early childhood caries (ECC). Similarly, the age and duration of breastfee ding and breast used as a pacifier were statistically significant ( p<0.000). However, the effect of bottle -feeding and age at which the bottle was weaned off, 71 sleeping with bottle or bottle being used as a pacifier did not have a statistical significance on the early childhood caries. Dietary intake of sugary beverages such as milk, soda, and candy were statistically significant (p<0.000) to the early childhood caries. Conclusions: This study documented early childhood caries among6- mo -6-year-olds childre n. Early childhood caries prevalence was associated with the feeding patterns and the influence of dietary sugars on their diet. Policy implications: Results show an urgent need for increased policies and awareness among the communities regarding early chi ldhood caries. Risk Factors for Epicondylitis in the Working Population Background: Epicondylitis is among the most commonly diagnosed work -related musculoskeletal disorders (WMD's). The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors associate d with epicondylitis among industrial workers. Methods: Between 2001 and 2010, five research groups, part of the NIOSH Consortium Study, conducted a coordinated prospective study of upper extremity WMD's among various industrial sites. In this study, a cross -sectional analysis of pooled data from three of the f ive research groups was performed in order to determine the associations of risk factors for epicondylitis. 1649 workers participated in structured interviews, physical examinations, and individual exposure assessments of biomechanical and psychosocial factors. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine the associations. Results: After exclusion, 1273 participants were included in the analysis. 36 subjects had the diagnosis of epicondylitis at baseline. Age 30 -40 (9.32, 95% CI 1.38- 62.94) and 40- 50 (16.32, 95% CI 1.13 -235.22), as well as being in \"fair/poor health\" (2.78, 95% CI 1.01- 7.62) on questionnaire were found to be significant personal risk factors. Worker rated peak hand force (3.21, 95% CI 1.25 -8.28) was found to be signifi cant biomechanical risk factors. Conclusion: In a multicenter study of industrial workers, being age 30- 40 and 40- 50, being in \"fair/poor health\", and worker rated peak hand force were found to be significant personal, work related, and biomechanical risk factors associated with epicondylitis. These findings may influence the design of workplace safety programs for the prevention of work -related epicondylitis. Silent Crisis at the Border: The Unmet Mental Health Needs of Migrant Children Over the past six years, the popular and political lens has focused on the plight of migrants from Central America and Mexico seeking asylum at the southern border of the United States. There are many reasons people leave their country of origin and make t he difficult journey to the United States. Many are fleeing unsafe or violent conditions, seeking family reunification, or opportunities to improve their livelihoods, and most experience an accumulation of traumas along the path . The escalation of aggre ssive policies by the U.S. government towards this group, particularly under the previous federal administration, has created a humanitarian crisis and public health emergency. These conditions have only worsened during the global pandemic from COVID -19, and the politically motivated response to effectively halt asylum processes of those seeking refuge at the border. Children and families are a particularly vulnerable group in this population. While ostensibly protected by international human rights declara tions from the United Nations as well as U.S. federal laws, in reality children in custody experience many violations of their entitled protections. Multiple published reports from advocacy groups, pediatricians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP ) document poor conditions in detention and processing centers. In the project I will explore the conditions and historical policies that led to the current crisis, the effects of the outgoing administration, and the subsequent effects of complex 72 trauma and adverse childhood experiences. Finally, I will identify recommendations for policies to reduce ongoing harm and specifically address mental health needs for children to ameliorate the current crisis and move towards a more humane system for children and families.

Shifting Caregiver Beliefs: Investigating the Impact of Early Relational Health Programs In this mixed methods study, the beliefs of caregivers were assessed using a questionnaire following the completion of eight sessions of CIRCLE OF SECURITY\u00ae Parenting (COSP) Program. The findings of this study reveal consistent shifts in caregivers' self -reported beliefs across the three Early Relational Health domains. These domains were reflective functioning, responsiveness, and avoidance of harsh parenting style. Additionally, caregivers reported dramatic shifts in their ability to interact with their children that was noticeable to both caregivers and their children. Findings sug gest a need to create additional policy and programs to connect caregivers with Early Relational Health training. Examining Tobacco Cessation in the Context of Diet and Physical Activity Changes among Chinese and Vietnamese Smokers and their Families Background: Smoking prevalence remains high among Asian American men. This study examined whether changes in diet and p hysical activity [PA] (among smokers themselves and their non -smoking family members) are associated with smoking cessation. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial where 340 smoker -family dyads received a lay health worker -led educational intervention on either smoking cessation (n=177) or diet and PA (n=163). Based on survey responses of both the smoker and family participants, changes in diet (meeting MyPlate recommendations) and PA (150 minutes/week) from baseline t o 6-month were categorized into: started, continued, stopped, and never. Multivariable analyses were used to examine whether diet and PA changes predicted 7 -day verified smoking abstinence at 12- month post - intervention, controlling for smoker demographics and tobacco use characteristics. Results: At 12 -month follow -up, this sample of Chinese (173, 51%) and Vietnamese (167, 49%) male smokers (mean age 54.6; 98% limited English; 42% no intention to quit at baseline) received either intervention achieved si milar 7- day smoking abstinence rates (overall = 24.4%). Smokers who started meeting diet recommendations at 6 -month (vs. never) were more likely to achieve abstinence at 12 -month [AOR=3.0, p=0.015]. Smokers whose family continued to exercise 150 minutes w eekly (vs. never) were more likely to achieve abstinence [AOR=2.4, p=0.032]. Conclusion: Healthy diet and PA of smokers and their family members independently predicted smoking abstinence. Examining tobacco cessation within the context of multiple healt h behavior changes at the individual and dyadic levels may yield promising interventions for Chinese and Vietnamese Americans.

We examined the relationship between maternal nativity and time in the US, and obesity and obesogenic behaviors among Asian American children. We analyzed public-use data from the 2013-2016 California Health Interview Survey for Asian American children ages 2 to 11 years. We used logistic regression to determine the odds of obesity and obesogenic behaviors associated with maternal nativity and time in the US. This study included n =609 children. Children of US-born mothers had lower odds of obesity (adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 0.12; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.91) and lower fruit intake (AOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.81) than children of recent immigrants ( <5 years in the US). Asian American children with recent immigrant mothers are more likely to be obese and eat less fruit than children with US-born mothers. E orts to prevent obesity and increase fruit consumption are particularly important for this vulnerable population of children of recent immigrants. Keywords: obesity; immigrants; nativity; Asian American; children 1. Introduction Asian American children are under-investigated in obesity research. In 2015-2016, 23.2% of Asian American children in the United States (US) were overweight, and 10.7% were obese [ 1]. While the prevalence of overweight /obesity is relatively low in this population compared to other racial /ethnic groups [ 1-3], there is a need to better understand risk factors for elevated body mass index (BMI) in Asian American children for several reasons. First, some Asian American ethnic subgroups have a higher prevalence of overweight /obesity than others [ 4-7]. One study found that Filipino and Vietnamese American children are more likely to have elevated BMI than their white peers [ 7]. Second, the prevalence of elevated BMI is increasing in some Asian American children. The national prevalence of obesity among Asian American girls increased sharply from 5.6% in 2011-2012 to 10.1% in 2015-2016 [ 1]. Third, a substantial proportion of Asian individuals are at risk of cardiometabolic disease at BMIs below the threshold for overweight [ 8], so the relatively low prevalence of overweight /obesity in this population may not be reassuring. Finally, Asian immigrants comprise the largest proportion of new arrivals to the US [ 9], and Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial /ethnic group overall [ 10]. With the growing Asian American population, it is increasingly important to examine the health of this group, particularly among recent immigrants. One factor that may a ect child BMI is maternal acculturation. As immigrants settle in the US, they may adopt Western obesogenic behaviors through acculturation, a complex process through which individuals from one culture adopt the practices of another [ 5,11]. Given the role of maternal influence on dietary [ 12-15] and sedentary behaviors [ 16-18], mothers may pass obesogenic habits Int. J. Environ. Res. Health doi:10.3390 /ijerph17051786 www.mdpi.com /ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1786 2 of 11 onto their children and increase their obesity risk. Exploring how acculturation might influence obesity and obesogenic behaviors may identify opportunities for intervention. 1.1. Maternal Acculturation and BMI The small body of literature exploring the relationship between maternal acculturation and BMI in Asian American children is mixed. Maternal acculturation, as measured by English prociency, has been shown to be a risk factor for consistent overweight /obesity in early elementary school children with less educated mothers but a protective factor in those with more educated mothers [ 5]. Another study found that Asian American preschool-age children with immigrant mothers had a lower obesity risk than those with US-born mothers [ 7]. Several studies by Chen et al. found an association between a lower maternal acculturation score on a multi-item questionnaire and elevated BMI in Chinese American children 8-10 years old [ 19-22]. These studies tended to be small and recruit from after-school programs and foreign-language schools in the San Francisco Bay Area [ 19-22], which may not represent the broader population. 1.2. Maternal Acculturation and Obesogenic Behaviors Few studies directly assess the association between maternal acculturation and obesogenic behaviors in Asian American children [ 11,23]. Studies by Chen et al. found that a higher maternal acculturation score was associated with low sedentary activity [ 21], while both a lower maternal acculturation score and unhealthy food choices were risk factors for elevated BMI [ 22] in Chinese American children. Another study found that Chinese American parents (predominantly mothers) with a higher acculturation score tend to practice an indulgent feeding style, impose less restriction of unhealthy foods, and apply less pressure to eat healthy foods [ 24]. One study described the eating habits of Chinese American preschoolers whose caregivers had generally low acculturation scores but did not directly assess the relationship between caregiver acculturation and child diet [ 25]. Again, these studies tended to be small and /or recruit from after-school programs, foreign-language schools, and childcare centers, which may not be broadly representative. There is also a need to study the relationship between maternal acculturation and a wider range of obesogenic behaviors. This study examined the association between two proxies of maternal acculturation (nativity and time in the US), and obesity and several obesogenic behaviors in a relatively large sample of Asian American children in California. We assessed whether children whose mothers were born in the US or have been in the country longer are more likely to be obese and engage in obesogenic behaviors (low fruit and vegetable intake, high sugar-sweetened beverage and fast food intake, and high sitting activity). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data This cross-sectional study examined public-use data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a continuous survey on various health topics [ 26]. The datasets generated and analyzed in this current study can be accessed on the CHIS website [ 26]. CHIS is the largest state health survey and provides representative data on all 58 counties in California [ 27]. CHIS uses a geographically stratied random-digit-dial telephone sampling strategy to randomly select households within counties and then one adult per household [ 28]. If present, children (birth to 11 years old) and adolescents (12-17 years old) may be interviewed separately [ 29]. Children are interviewed by proxy through the parent /guardian most knowledgeable about their health [ 29]. CHIS oversamples Korean and Vietnamese households [ 30] and conducts interviews in several languages [ 31] to increase Asian American representation.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1786 3 of 11 2.2. Sample We pooled public-use data from the 2013-2016 CHIS for children 2-11 years old. These years were chosen to represent the most recently available datasets that include the variables of interest and dene them similarly. We excluded children <2 years because they have di erent BMI thresholds for overweight /obesity than older children [ 32]. Since obesity was a primary outcome, we excluded children with no reported weight. The data were otherwise complete for the variables of interest. To account for biologically implausible anthropometric data and reduce misclassication bias in BMI categorization due to parental misreporting, we excluded children with weights or heights beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range for age and sex. We included all remaining children that were reported as being non-Hispanic Asian (exclusive of mixed-race children), which we referred to as \"Asian American\". 2.3. Measures We used two proxies for maternal acculturation: nativity and time in the US. Maternal nativity was a binary variable: immigrant and US-born. Maternal time in the US was an ordinal variable with ve levels: <5 years, 5-14 years, 15-24 years, \u001525 years, and US-born. US nativity and increasing time in the US served as proxies for acculturation, similar to larger studies in Asian American populations [5,6,33-36] in which acculturation questionnaires were not administered. BMI was organized into three categories based on age- and sex-specic guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ 32]: not overweight as the outcome, children with BMI <85th percentile served as the reference group. Dietary behaviors were dichotomized based on literature using CHIS data to examine Asian children's obesogenic dietary practices [ 6]. Fruit and vegetable intake were determined by the number of caregiver-dened servings consumed yesterday. Given the low prevalence of soda and sweetened fruit drink consumption in the sample and the conceptual similarity of these drinks, they were combined into sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). SSB intake was determined by the number of glasses or cans of SSBs consumed yesterday. Fast food intake was dened as the number of times fast food was eaten in the past week. Similar to prior literature [ 6], consuming <2 servings of fruit yesterday, <2 servings of vegetables yesterday, \u00151 serving of SSB yesterday, and \u00151 serving of fast food last week were considered \"obesogenic behaviors\". Sedentary behavior was measured by sitting activity, dened as the number of hours spent sitting and watching TV , playing computer games, talking with friends, or doing other sitting activities on a typical weekday. Sitting activity was dichotomized, dening >2 hours per day as an \"obesogenic behavior\" based on literature linking this amount of childhood TV time with adult overweight status [37]. Family income was identied as an important covariate and dened as a percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL): 0%-99% FPL, 100%-199% FPL, 200%-299% FPL, and \u0015300% FPL. Besides child age and sex, there were no other relevant covariates, including ethnic subgroup and maternal education level, that were consistently available in the 2013-2016 public-use dataset. 2.4. Analyses We computed descriptive statistics of the participants' characteristics. Bivariate analyses were conducted using chi-square tests with the Rao-Scott second-order correction to account for the complex survey design. These analyses examined the associations between maternal nativity and time in the US, and child BMI and obesogenic behaviors. Separate multivariate logistic regression models examined the association between maternal nativity and time in the US, and child obesity and obesogenic behaviors, while adjusting for family income. Replicate weights provided by CHIS were used in all analyses to account for the complex survey design. All analyses were conducted using STATA /ICInt. J. Environ. Res.

Human Subjects The University of California, Berkeley Institutional Review Board conrmed that this study was secondary analysis of a publicly available, de-identied database, which is not considered human subjects research. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 3. Results 3.1. Sample Asian American children accounted for 8.4% of the 8507 children ages 2-11 years in the 2013-2016 CHIS dataset. From this subset, excluding those without a reported weight (n =65) or an implausible weight /height (n =39) yielded a sample of 609 children. 3.2. Demographics Table 1 displays the participants' characteristics. Among the children, 55.4% were boys, and the mean age was 7 years. Most families (62.9%) were in the highest income bracket, and most mothers (76.2%) were foreign-born. Among immigrant mothers, 15.2% had been in the US for <5 years, 36.6% for 5-14 years, 21.4% for 15-24 years, and 26.8% for \u001525 years. Table 1.

Overall, 9.6% of children were overweight, and 24.7% were obese. There was a signicant association between income and BMI, with the lowest income group having more than 2.5 times the prevalence of obesity as the highest income group. Table 2.

Maternal Nativity In the multivariate analyses (Table 3), there was a trend toward children with US-born mothers having lower odds of obesity than those with immigrant mothers ( p=0.055), after adjusting for income. Higher income was signicantly associated with lower odds of obesity. There were no associations between maternal nativity and obesogenic behaviors in either the bivariate or multivariate analyses.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1786 6 of 11 Table 3.

Maternal Time in the US In the multivariate analyses (Table 3), children with US-born mothers had 88% lower odds of obesity than children with recent immigrant mothers ( <5 years in the US), after adjusting for income (p=0.040). Higher income was signicantly associated with lower odds of obesity. In the bivariate analyses, there was a trend for the prevalence of low fruit intake ( <2 servings yesterday) to decrease with increasing maternal time in the US ( p=0.052). This nding was signicant in the multivariate analyses (Table 4); compared to children of recent immigrants, children whose mothers had been in the US for \u001525 years had 89% lower odds of low fruit intake ( p=0.011), and children of US-born mothers had similarly lower odds ( p=0.027), after adjusting for income. There were no associations between maternal time in the US and other obesogenic behaviors. In the multivariate analyses, children whose mothers had been in the US for 5-14, 15-24, or \u0015 25 years had similar odds of obesity (Table 3) and low fruit intake (Table 4), which were lower than for children of recent immigrants. We performed post-hoc analyses to examine whether these three groups could be considered one homogenous group. We re-coded maternal time in the US into three levels: <5 years, \u00155 years, and US-born. The odds of obesity and low fruit intake for the combined \u0015 5 year group were essentially unchanged and remained lower than for the <5 year group, though only the di erence in fruit intake was signicant. Specically, children whose mothers have been in the US for\u00155 years had lower odds of low fruit intake (adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 0.19; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90) than children of recent immigrants, after adjusting for income.Int.

Discussion This study explored the relationship between maternal nativity and time in the US, and child obesity and obesogenic behaviors in Asian Americans. Children with US-born mothers were not more likely to be obese than those with immigrant mothers as a whole. This nding di ers from a study showing that Asian American preschool-age children with immigrant mothers are less likely to be obese than those with US-born mothers [ 7]. The contrast may be due to mothers being particularly influential on the diet [ 15] and physical activity [ 18] of younger children. The older children included in our study might be more influenced by external factors that attenuate any protective e ects of having immigrant mothers. The likelihood of obesity did not increase with increasing maternal time in the US. The only signicant di erence in the odds of obesity was between children of recent immigrants ( <5 years in the US) and children with US-born mothers. Using less time in the US as a proxy for lower acculturation, this result strengthens several studies in Chinese American children linking lower maternal acculturation scores with elevated BMI [ 19-22]. This study highlights children of recent immigrants as a vulnerable group that should be addressed in future obesity prevention research and interventions and challenges the notion that lower acculturation is protective. While prior studies have shown Asian American children as a whole to have a relatively low risk of elevated BMI [ 1-3], this study adds nuance to the literature by suggesting that the risk of obesity is not homogenous in this population. Specically, a subgroup of children with recent immigrant mothers have a higher risk of obesity than peers with US-born mothers. It is unclear whether children of recent immigrants tend to arrive in the US already obese or adopt obesogenic behaviors as they are exposed to a Westernized environment. Children of recent immigrants may also tend to come from countries where they experience food insecurity and encounter dietary excess upon arrival in the US [ 38]. This abrupt change in dietary environment may lead to an initially higher risk of obesity, which may stabilize or decrease as they spend more time in the US. These processes are important to explore further. Few studies directly assess the relationship between maternal acculturation and obesogenic behaviors in Asian American children [ 11,23], and this study adds to the literature by exploring several behaviors. Children whose mothers were US-born or have been in the country longer were not more likely to engage in obesogenic behaviors. Children of recent immigrants were actually more likely to have low fruit intake than those whose mothers were US-born or have been in the US for \u001525 years.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1786 8 of 11 This nding aligns with literature suggesting that maternal acculturation explains di erences in fruit consumption among Asian ethnic groups [6]. In post-hoc analyses, children whose mothers have been in the US for \u00155 years were less likely to have low fruit intake than children of recent immigrants. This nding adds complexity to the literature by highlighting the heterogeneity in dietary behavior among Asian American children and specically identifying children of recent immigrants as a nutritionally vulnerable subgroup. Recent immigrants may consider fruit a special occasion item that is less important than other foods [ 39]. Culturally preferred fruits may also be more costly or di \u000ecult to nd [ 40]. Increasing access to a ordable, culturally acceptable fruits may improve intake in children of recent immigrants. There are several reasons why children whose mothers are US-born or have been in the country longer may not be more likely to engage in obesogenic behaviors. With the rise of caloric processed foods in Asian countries due to globalization and urbanization [ 41,42], recent immigrants may already have obesogenic behaviors upon arrival and have a similar or higher risk of obesity than US-born peers. Additionally, increased time in the US may not equate to increased adoption of Western behaviors. Recent immigrants may come from countries with a heavy Western influence and already have obesogenic practices before arriving. Conversely, mothers who have lived in the US for decades may maintain a traditional diet and expose their children to these foods. Finally, maternal and child diets may di er [23,38,43], despite parental e orts to retain a traditional diet [ 38,43], particularly in older children. Lower income was consistently associated with a higher odds of obesity. Adjusting for income attenuated the initially signicant di erence in the odds of obesity between children of immigrant versus US-born mothers. This nding reinforces the link between low income and elevated BMI [ 4] and the interconnectedness of socioeconomic status and acculturation [ 5] in Asian American children. While Asian Americans are the highest earning racial /ethnic group, they are the most economically divided, partly due to di erent sociopolitical histories and immigration policies that shape their experiences [ 44]. Furthermore, low acculturation is associated with food insecurity in most Asian American subgroups [ 35], and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is low in this population [ 35]. Providing nancial assistance to low income, less acculturated families and addressing barriers to SNAP participation may help reduce obesity in Asian American children. Community-based interventions that are sensitive to cultural food preferences can also be helpful in promoting healthier dietary habits in Asian American populations [45]. This study has several strengths. We used a dataset designed to be representative of a state with a large Asian American population, with oversampling of less represented subgroups. The sample was larger than many studies exploring the relationship between maternal acculturation and obesogenic behaviors in Asian American children. We examined two proxies for acculturation, which are important to distinguish, and several obesogenic behaviors. In terms of limitations, causal relationships cannot be established in this cross-sectional study. Caregiver-reported data may reduce internal validity, including in BMI classication [ 46], though we did attempt to reduce misclassication bias by omitting biologically implausible data. Additionally, asking caregivers to describe children's fruit, vegetable, or SSB intake over the past day may not capture their typical diet. Other dietary assessment methods, such as 7-day food records, may be more representative but potentially more burdensome. We were unable to conduct ethnic subgroup analysis because this information was not consistently available in the public-use CHIS dataset for children in 2013-2016. Studies have noted interethnic variation in the risk of child obesity and obesogenic behaviors [ 4-7]. Thus, care should be taken in extrapolating our ndings to a particular subgroup, and further studies are needed to assess the replicability of our results in di erent Asian American ethnicities. Given the limitations of the dataset, we were also unable to examine the e ects of maternal education level, which has previously been described as an important factor in the relationship between maternal acculturation and child BMI [ 5]. Additionally, we used proxies that do not fully capture the concept of acculturation. Acculturation is a complex process that a ects beliefs, attitudes,Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1786 9 of 11 and behaviors [ 21] and can manifest in multiple dimensions of life [ 20] in varying ways. Smaller studies have used multi-item acculturation questionnaires [ 19-22,25], but nativity and time in the US have been used as proxies in larger studies in Asian American populations in which detailed acculturation scales were not administered [ 5,6,33-36]. Finally, we used data from 2013-2016, which may not be representative of the current population. However, there is a lag in the availability of yearly data in the public-use CHIS dataset, and we needed to pool multiple years given the small number of Asian American children. This limitation speaks to the need for larger datasets on the health of Asian American children for future research. 5. Conclusions While Asian American children are known to have a relatively low risk of elevated BMI, a subgroup of children with recent immigrant mothers are more likely to be obese and eat less fruit than those with US-born mothers. Children of immigrants are not homogeneous, and e orts to prevent obesity and increase fruit consumption are particularly important for a more vulnerable population of Asian American children of recent immigrants.

Keywords: vape, vaping, e-cigarettes, social media, instag ram, deep learning, images INTRODUCTION Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also known as e -cigarettes ( National Institute on Drug Use, 2018 ), are now the most-commonly-used tobacco products among Ame rican teenagers ( Centers for Disease Control and Preventions, 2019 ). According to the National Youth Tobacco Survey, the fraction of high-school students who reported using e-cigarettes jumped from 12% in 2017 to 28% in 2019 ( Wang et al., 2019 ). In combination with stagnating declines in the use of other tobacco products, this considerable increase in e-cigarette consumption has reversed recent progress in cont rolling adolescent tobaccoVassey et al. Measuring E-Cigarette Influence on Instagram use (The U.S. Food Drug Administration, 2018a; Gentzke et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019 ). While the long-term health eects of e-cigarette consumption are not fully understood ( American Cancer Society, 2017 ), e-cigarettes can harm the adolescent brain and increase susceptibility to tobacco addiction ( The U.S. DepartmentofHealthHumanServices,2016;Fraga,2019;Wang etal.,2019 ).Asaresult,youthwhousee-cigarettesaremorelikely to subsequently try combustible cigarettes ( The U.S. Food Drug Administration, 2018a ). Beyond addiction, e-cigarettes pose a risk of breathing diculties, inflammatory reactions, lowe red defenseagainstpathogensandlungdiseases( CentersforDisease Control and Prevention, 2019a,b; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration,2019d ). The design and portability of e-cigarette devices contribut e to their growing popularity among young people. E-cigarettes deliver high concentrations of nicotine from a device the si ze of a USB flash drive ( SupplementalFigure1 ) while producing adiscreetvapor cloud. Pod devices with disposable or rellable cartridge-basedsystemsareparticularlypopularamongbeginn er users due to their simple design and convenience ( MistHub, 2015; Matt, 2018; Fraga, 2019 ). More experienced users may opt for larger tank systems (also called mods, box mods or sub- ohm devices) ( MistHub, 2015; Smoketastic, 2016 ) that must be manually-relledwithliquid(alsocalledE-juiceorE-liqu id). Young adults are exposed to e-cigarette endorsements from peersandinfluencers( Carbone,2018;Dyer,2019;TheU.S.Food and Drug Administration, 2019b; VaporDNA, 2019 ), on social media. Exposure to social media marketing and other forms of visualadvertisinghavebeenassociatedwithincreasede-c igarette useamongadolescents( Kingetal.,2016;MaloneyandCappella, 2016; Pokhrel et al., 2017; al., 2019b; Wang et al., 201 9). InstagramisoneplatformpopularwithU.S.teenagersandyoung adults (Lee et al., 2015; Smith and Anderson, 2018; Clement, 2019) through which e-cigarette brands have used visual advertising to market their products ( Philips, 2018; Hatchinson, 2019). Tobacco companies like JUUL (which controls 70% of the U.S. e-cigarette market) ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018; Richtel and Kaplan, 2018; Huang et al., 2019 ; Sherman, 2019 ) have used Instagram to promote vaping and to brand their products as safe alternatives to conventional cigarettes( Brodwin,2018;Dyer,2019 ),perpetuatinga\"cost-free\" mentality( TheU.S.FoodDrugAdministration,2018a )towarde- cigarettes.Inonenationalsurveyofhigh-schoolstudents ,nearly 80% of the respondents perceived \"no great risk of harm from regular use of e-cigarettes\" ( Johnston et al., 2019 ). One common misconception among users is that e-cigarette aerosol consi sts of innocuous water reality, e-cigarette vaporcancontainseveralharmfulsubstances,includingnic otine, lead,volatileorganiccompounds,andcancer-causingagent s1. In September 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched \"The Real Cost\" Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign in U.S. high schools as well as on social media platforms, including YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, Facebook an d 1Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (2019) : About Electronic Cigarettes. Last reviewed November 15, 2018. https://www.cdc. gov/tobacco/ basic_information/e-cigarettes/about-e-cigarettes.html.Instagram. The campaign aims to educate nearly 10.7 million youth aged 12-17 about the hazards of e-cigarettes. It is a ne arly $60 million eort funded by fees collected TheU.S.FoodDrugAdministration,2018a ). Tofurtherdiscourageyouthtobaccouse( TheU.S.FoodDrug Administration,2018b ),inNovember2018,theFDAannounced arestrictiononfruity-orsweet-flavorede-liquidssales, allowing them or through onlinemerchantsthatuseage-verication( KaplanandHoman, ), and a requirementthatallENDSmust\"beartheaddictivenesswarn ing statements on product packages and advertisements,\" includin g on social media ( The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019e). Despite this regulation, social media influencers have continued to post vaping content on behalf of e-cigarette manufacturers, often failing to include the required nicot ine warning( TheU.S.FoodandDrugAdministration,2019b ). Here we provide a descriptive analysis of Instagram content related to e-cigarettes and comment on the initial impact of t he FDA's social media intervention to reduce vaping among youth . We analyze samples of Instagram posts BEFORE and AFTER the FDA introduced The Real Cost campaign and other anti- vapingmeasures toevaluatechangesinthevolume, themes,an d user-engagement(numberoflikes)ofvaping-relatedposts. MATERIALS AND METHODS This mixed method study consisted of two parts: (1) Deep learning analysis of images and captions from Instagram posts; (2) focus groups with young social media users and interviews with Instagram vaping influencers. The goal of the focus groups and interviews was to reinforce, validate, and contextuali ze the data analysis. The study was approved by the Internal Review Board of the University of California, Berkeley Committee fo r ProtectionofHumanSubjects(CPHS). Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Instagram Posts Instagram Data Collection Wecollectedvaping-relatedInstagrampostsbeforeandafterth e FDAstarteditsanti-e-cigarettecampaignandcomparedthepre - intervention (2017, 2018) and post-intervention (2019) sampl es. The posts were obtained by accessing the Instagram Application Programming Interface (API) using subscriptions to web-based applications designed for hashtag tracking. Access to the 201 9 data was provided by the social network analyzer Keyhole (Toronto, Canada). The 2017 and 2018 data were collected as part of a prior study ( Laestadius et al., 2019 ) that used the social networkanalyzerNetlytic(Toronto,Canada)andprovidedtoth e authorsbytheUniversityofWisconsin-Milwaukee. For the 2019 sample, we collected 201,703publicly available posts by tracking the following Instagram hashtags which were linked to the promotion and endorsement of vaping in previous content analysis ( Laestadius et al., 2016, Frontiers in Communication | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2020 | Volume 4 | Article 75Vassey et al. Measuring E-Cigarette Influence on Instagram FIGURE 1 | Timeline for the collection of vaping-related Instagram pos ts. from the FDA campaign by tracking the hashtag #TheRealCost (Figure1). For the 2017 and 2018 edonly if the termsusedinthecaption;however,atleastseveralotherhas htags (e.g.,#vapeor#vapenation)werealwayspresentaswell. Instagram posts were collected in real time during sampling periods of <2 weeks. Posts were captured 24h a day at a rate determined by the API limit of about 100 posts per hour. The collecteddataincludedtheURLsforimagesandvideos,thedat e andtimeofposting,thelikecountandcaptionsforeachpost. Number of \"Likes\" on Instagram \"Likes\" is a metric engagement ( Chu et al., 2017; Boogaard, 2018; Sunshy Group of Companies, 2018 ) and an important indicator of a post's impact ( Sherman et al., 2017; Mart\u00ednez-Pecino and Garc\u00eda-Gavil\u00e1n, 2019 ). We compared the median \" like\" count and the proportion of posts with more than 100 \"likes\" on Instagram posts before and after the FDA campaign.Forthepurposesofthiscomparison,wereplicatedthe protocolwhichwaspreviouslyusedbyLaestadiusetal.tocoll ect the2017and2018Instagramsamples( Laestadiusetal.,2019 ),by restricting our June 2019 sample to the 22,000 Instagram posts containing #ejuice or #eliquid as one of the terms in the post' s caption(Figure1). Image Analysis We performed deep learning image classication analysis of #ejuice and #eliquid posts from the 2017 sample ( N=14,810), the 2018 sample ( N=14,907) and the June 2019 sample ( N =14,982).Thesesamplesexcludedanyimagesthatwereremovedfrom Instagram by the posts' authors during the data collecti on period (and prior to analysis). Based on image classication themes identied in the previous studies were dividedintothefollowingsixcategories:(1) manand(2)woman (facial images of men or women, usually posing with vaping devices or vape juice bottles or exhaling smoke clouds), (3) mod and (4)poddevices, (5) e-juice, and (6) other. Male or female handsholdingavapingdeviceorabottleofe-juicewereassig ned totheappropriatevapingdevicecategories. Deep learning image classication analysis was based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN) framework ( The University of Stanford, Keras, 2015; Deshpande, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018 ) that recognizes and classies images by extracting features from an input image (as a matrix of pixel values) and generates a probability distribution over possibl e outputclasses(e.g.,0.80foraman,0.15foramodsystemdevi ce, and 0.05 for e-juice). For each image we selected the output class that had the highest predicted probability in our image classication analysis. We applied transfer learning and ne- tuning(TensorFlow,2017 )tocreateacustomizedimageclassier capable of recognizing and classifying vaping images. We used the existing CNN called Inception v32trained by Google on an image dataset consisting of over 1,000,000 images of abou t 1,000 dierent classes ( ImageNet Library, 2016 ) as the basis for building our own classication model. We ne-tuned Inception 2Google Cloud: Advanced Guide to Inception v3 on Cloud TPU. https:// cloud. google.com/tpu/docs/inception-v3-advanced.

These images were manually reviewed, grouped and labeled according to the six identied classes. The resulting image dataset was divided into a trai ning (1,745 images) and validation set (356 images) at a ratio of 5 :1. To ne-tune the neural network we added a 128-unit dense layer, followed by dropout with 60% probability, and then a 6-unit output layer with softmax activation. The model was optimized for categorical cross-entropy loss over 8 epochs usi ng stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.00001 . The model achieved 0.90 validation accuracy and 0.32 validatio n loss (SupplementaryFigure2). The model was not trained to identify more than one class in a single image. For the images featuring more than one class (e.g., mod, e-juice, group of people),weconsideredthepredictioncorrectiftheclassica tion wasaccurateforeitheroftheclasses. The ne-tuned model was rst evaluated on the smaller set of 4,956 images from the 2017 sample ( N=1,486 posts), the 2018sample( N=1,512posts),andtheMarch2019sample( N= 1,958 posts), which were labeled manually. The model correct ly classied above 90% of the images with men, women, e-juices, mod system devices across all samples. The model correctly classied90%oftheimageswith podsystemdevicesinthe2019 sample, 64% of those images in the 2018 sample and 30% in the 2017 sample ( SupplementaryFigure3) .

We also manually reviewed 1,958 posts for the presence of a warning label and a geographic location, and 4,956 posts for th e presenceofsexually-explicitimagery. Text Analysis Weappliedtextminingandnaturallanguageprocessingmethods using Tidytext software package in R to analyze and quantify the content of Instagram captions ( Silge and Robinson, 2017 ). We counted the most frequently used words in Instagram captions from the pre- and post-FDA intervention samples. We ignored #eliquid and #ejuice as they were used in every captio n (by design) as well as \"stop words\" such as connecting verbs, prepositions and articles in English and other languages (e.g ., \"the\" \"is,\" \"to\") that are not useful for analysis ( Manning and Sch\u00fctze,1999 ).Wealsoanalyzedthecontextsurroundingwords commonlyusedinInstagramcaptionsofthe#eliquidand#ejuic e posts compared to captions of #TheRealCost posts from the March 2019 sample. We used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis topic modeling based on unsupervised clustering ( Silge andRobinson,2017 ).TheLDAgroupedthedatasetofInstagram captions from our sampled posts into a mixture of topics by connectingsimilarwordstogetherandcalculatingtheproba bility (Beta coecient) that the grouped words would be part of a selected topic. The desired number of topics and the numberof words per topic are user-dened parameters in LDA. Since Instagramcaptionsaresparseandshorttextswithdiversethe mes (Hong and Davison, 2010 ), good results have been achieved in previous studies ( Steinskog et al., 2017; Maier et al., 2018 ) by using a higher number of topics than what is needed for larger, more coherent corpora. We used 50 clusters (K =50) and a thresholdprobabilityfortopicinclusionof2%(Beta =1/K).We reviewed the words with the highest probabilities for each to pic (top words) and attempted to label the substantive content of thetopic,ashasbeendonepreviously( HongandDavison,2010; Steinskogetal.,2017;Maieretal.,2018 ). Focus Groups and Interviews With Instagram Influencers ThefocusgroupparticipantswererecruitedinMarch-April,201 9 among undergraduate students of the University of Californi a, Berkeley, and Berkeley City College and among other Berkeley residents who were not students. We included a racially-dive rse group of male ( N=4) and female ( N=4) participants between 18 and 25 years of age who reported that they used social media daily. Although e-cigarette consumption was not an inclusion criterion,fourofeightfocusgroupparticipantsreportedvapi ng. The participants were asked to identify their preferred social media platform and the frequency of its use, as well as whether theyoftenseesocialmediapostsrelatedtovaping,includingt he FDA anti-vaping campaign images and videos. The participants wereaskedtosharetheirimpressionsofaselectionofimages and videos related to vaping and the FDA campaign and were asked todescribewhatcontenttheyfoundmostengaging. We contacted 100 influencers with public Instagram accounts to request an interview. The list of potential interviewees was seeded with popular influencers referenced in the literature and then expanded via algorithmic Instagram suggestions.Fiveinfluencersagreedtobeinterviewed.The group was comprised of three men and two women; one participant was from the U.K. and the other four were from the U.S. Group member followings ranged from 2,000 to over 200,000 Instagram users (Mean =73000,SD=74000). During the semi-structured interviews ( Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2008) the participants were asked about their vaping habits, the motivation to promote vaping products, knowledge of influencers' marketing strategies and collaboration with v aping brands. They were also asked to share Instagram analytics data, which provided information on the age distribution of theirfollowers. RESULTS As expected, our manual review of the posts and text analysis of the corresponding captions indicated that nearly all of the posts we collected by tracking #ejuice and #eliquid promoted or endorsed vaping. In contrast, the FDA posts featuring #TheRealCost hashtag were the only posts which we identied inoursamplethatcontainedanti-vapingsentiments. Frontiers in Communication | www.frontiersin.org 4 January 2020 | Volume 4 | Article 75Vassey et al. Measuring E-Cigarette Influence on Instagram Number of 2018, the FDA-sponsored \"anti-vaping\" hashtag #TheRealCost has been used about 50 times per month on Instagram, whereas \"pro-vaping\" hashtags like #ejuice or #eliquid were used 1,000 times more often. Comparing the pre- intervention (2017, 2018) and post-intervention (2019) #e- juice and #e-liquid samples, we found a three-fold increase in the median like count (10 vs. 28 likes) ( Figure2) and a 6-fold increase in the proportion of posts with more than 100 likes (2 vs.15%).ThemedianlikecountfortheFDAcampaignpostswas comparable (23 likes) although, again, the volume of posts was muchsmaller. Image Analysis Quantitative Image Analysis We performed a deep learning image classication analysis of Instagram posts with captions containing hashtags #ejuice or #eliquid from sub-category E-juicewas the most prevalent subject in all three samples. The proportion of E-juiceimages remained relatively consistent in 2017(36%),2018(41%),and2019(40%).Theproportionof Mod images decreased in 2019 (21%) compared to 2018 (27%) and 2017 (30%); correspondingly, Podimages became more popular, increasing from 2017 (0.9%), to 2018 (2%), to 2019 (9%). We observed a 3-fold increase in the median like count in the 201 9 sample compared to the 2017 and 2018 samples for each class of images, which was consistent with the overall 3-fold increa se in the median like count presented in Figure2. Images of women hadthehighestmedianlikecountinallthreesamples( Table1). Qualitative Image Analysis Warninglabels Despite the 2018 FDA requirement to add warning labels to tobacco-product advertising on social media, we found thatmost of the images with the highest like count analyzed in our June 2019 sample ( N=1,958 posts, likes >100) did not containwarninglabelsincompliancewiththeFDArequiremen ts (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019c ). The images featuring e-juice had the highest prevalence of warning labe ls (11%),followedbyimagesofwomenandpoddevices(5%),mod devices (4%) and men (3%). We found fewer than 1% of images with warning labels in both 2017 and 2018 samples, before the warningrequirementwasintroduced. Sexually-explicitimagery Overall, we found that - among Instagram posts featuring women-about1in8postsintheJune2019and1in4postsinthe 2017 and 2018 samples contained sexually-explicit imagery.

Not all vaper s are the vapers that engage in the vaping sub-culture on social media. [They wear] certain kind of clothing, speak in a certain way. They are usually men , in their teens or 20s. Vapers have skateboard, [they are] skinny. 1.2 JUUL is a new thing. It is like e-cigarettes, it is different th an vaping. I see a lot of them on social media and it is not seen in a same way as vap ers. JUUL is so ubiquitous, it is everywhere. It becomes normalize d, it is like a cool new thing and everyone does it. When people look at you when you smoke a cigarette, they think that's bad for you and it is going to give you cancer. JUUL I guess is suppo sed to be healthier. JUUL is a different device, which produces less s moke and less vape. Design in general. JUUL is like slick. Not like a giant, really weird-looking devices. The design makes JUUL look low key. T hat is probably what draws people to it. 1.3 [The quote describes a video featuring a vaping influencer mak ing a bubble out of e-liquid] With a bubble is a cool video, like a magic sho w. 1.4 I do not think this message is effective. It is super like a fanc y way of reminding us that nicotine is addictive. I imagine myself sc rolling on my phone, trying to enjoy myself and [the FDA anti-vaping campa ign] is trying to tell me what to do. #TheRealCost posts, including all of the anti-vaping and anti- smoking images and videos ever posted from the ocial FDA campaign account ( 16%) as well as from other users ( 84%). This stark imbalance in the volume of posts has caused the FDA message to be overwhelmed by direct and sponsored marketing fromthevapingbrands. Low Impact on User Interaction With Vaping Images and Low Engagement When comparing the user interaction with the #e-juice and #e-liquid Instagram posts from before and after the initiati on of the FDA Real Cost campaign, we found a large increase in the median like count and in the proportion of posts with more than 100 likes. Our results indicate that the number of Instagram users exposed to vaping images and videos could be still growing, despite the FDA's intervention eorts on socia l media. Despite accumulatinga large amount offollowers durin g the four years of its existence (62,000), the most recent (20 17- 2019) anti-smoking and anti-vaping images and videos posted by the TheRealCost account have had a low engagement rate (Canning, 2018; Plann, 2019 ) of just 0.8% per post. For comparison,agoodengagementrateonInstagramisconsidere d to be between 3 and 6% ( Plann, 2019 ).

I wouldn't call myself a model, I just do vape tricks. It's more like a hobby you make money out of. But within my area there's about probably 10 people in my area that I'm frien ds with that do what I do. Guys and girls. 2.3 [Instagram] is like going to a car show to see what's new.

They send me something new\u2014I show it off. that appeal to youth on social media (directly or through influencers) ( Associated Press, 2019; Kong et al., 2019 ). In 2017, Laestadius et al. ( Laestadius et al., 2019 ) conducted a qualitative-contentanalysisofInstagrampostsfeaturinge-li quid to identify common themes, claims and product promotions. The study found that about 60% of the 1,000 images and videos analyzed contained promotions of e-liquids. We found that e- juiceremained the most prevalent topic in our samples before andaftertheFDAcampaign,andthenumberofimagesfeaturing poddevices (commonly used by beginner e-cigarette users) has been growing. Aesthetically pleasing images of male and fema le models that could alter young users' perceptions ( Harris and Bardey, 2019 ) were also frequent among the posts featuring vaping products in our samples. Moreover, Instagram analytics data collected from vaping influencers showed considerable proportions of underage (13-17 year-old) followers, indicat ing that youth will likely continue to be exposed to vaping content marketed on Instagram. This nding is consistent with a recent Kim et al. ( Kim et al., 2019a ) which demonstrated that over 40 percent of JUUL Twitter account followers are underage (13-17 years old). Exposure to potentially harmful social medi a content is even more concerning, as previous studies here demonstratedthatteenagersoftenrelatetoInstagraminflue ncers more than to their physical friends ( Ma\u00f1as-Viniegra et al., 2019). Non-compliance With Warning Label Requirements Despite the 2018 FDA requirement that all ENDS \"bear the addictiveness warning statements on product packages and advertisements\" on social media, we found that, overall, on ly about 7% of the posts in our June 2019 sample contained warnings in compliance with the FDA requirements ( The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019c ). Posts uploaded from locations within the U.S. had the highest prevalence of warnin g Frontiers in Communication | www.frontiersin.org 8 January 2020 | Volume 4 | Article 75Vassey et al. Measuring E-Cigarette Influence on Instagram labels,whilepostsuploadedfromothercountrieswerelessli kely to include warnings. Most of the international posts featured vaping products distributed in the U.S. and would therefore sti ll besubjecttocompliancewiththeFDAwarning-labelregulati ons (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019c ). This nding indicates that there should be increased enforcement of the warning-label regulation, especially among the internatio nal networkofinfluencers,distributorsandretailers. Participatory Strategies for Discouraging Youth Vaping One major challenge facing the FDA's anti-vaping campaign is the common perception among youth that vaping is a harmless activity (Kim et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2019 ), a misconception perpetuatedbytobacco-industrymarketing( Huangetal.,2019 ). In an attempt \"cost-free\" menta lity toward vaping ( The U.S. Food Drug Administration, 2018a )1, the FDA campaign features images and videos of distorted faces and brains that are meant to reveal the real (but hard to see) detrimental health eects ( The U.S. Department of Health Human Services, 2016, 2017; American Cancer Society, 2017; Chungetal.,2018;CentersforDiseaseControlandPreventi ons, 2019; Gentzke et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019 ) of e-cigarette consumption. Most of our focus-group participants found these images and videos repulsive and scary; however, seeing them did not motivate any e-cigarette users in our group ( N=4 of 8) to quit vaping. Generally, appealing to fear in order to raise awareness about health concerns such as smoking can be a valid approach if the messaging is based on evidence or reason (Simpson, 2017 ). However, fear-inducing tactics can only be eective when an intervention target is perceived as a threat (Albarracin et al., 2005 ). While smoking is viewed by many consumers as a risky behavior, vaping is not. Some Instagram users responded to the FDA warnings about the danger of vaping aerosol with comments disputing the FDA claims of damaginghealtheectsfromnicotineorbyaskingpublichealt h ocials to provide a list of toxic chemicals that are present in e- cigarettesasaproofoftheirharmfulness.Theusersalsoref erred to the FDA campaign as \"propaganda\" that people should not take \"seriously\" and suggested that the campaign's anti-vapi ng ads just scared people without actually encouraging them to quitvaping. Previous research ( Albarracin et al., 2005 ) indicates that participatory, active intervention strategies could be more eective than passive educational campaigns. Indeed, our focu s- group participants suggested that sharing vaping experiences i n group discussions might be an alternative cessation strate gy. Similar interventions were described as eective elsewhere (Ramoetal.,2014 ).Vapingbrandsarealreadyusingparticipatory strategiestoeectivelyengagebothlegal-ageandunderage vapers as social-media promoters and brand ambassadors.

Our interviews indicate that vaping enthusi asts andinfluencersviewtheseincentivesasalluring.Perhaps,pu blichealth rt the vaping brands' marketing strategies and engage youth in developingandmarket-testinganti-vapingmessages. Legislative Intervention for Discouraging Youth Vaping National, state, and local programs have been shown to reduce and prevent youth tobacco use ( Centers for Disease Control and Preventions, 2019 ), for example by raising taxes for tobacco products or by raising the minimum age of sale to 21 years. The legal minimum age to purchase e-cigarettes diers by state , rangingfrom18to21,butamajorityofstateshavenolegislat ive restrictions in place prohibiting the useof e-cigarettes by youth who have not yet reached the legal minimum age of sale. Businesses violating restrictions on the sale of e-cigaret tes to youth can face a range of minor penalties including a simple warning (in 3 states), a ne (in 31 states), or a misdemeanor criminal charge (in 16 states) ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019c ). Only a handful of states have excise tax on e-cigarette sales ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019c). Youth E-cigarette use could be further discouraged by raising the legal age for e-cigarette purchase to 21 in all sta tes, byintroducingstricterpenaltiesforunderagesalesoruse,a ndby increasingtaxesonproducts. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH Although the classication accuracy of the deep learning im age analysiswassucientfordescriptivecontentanalysis,itwa snot perfectly accurate. For device classication, the model was o nly trained to recognize one class per image, whereas some images had two classes (e.g., \" e-juice\"and \"mod\"). Distinguishing pod and mod systems by machine algorithm was also a challenging task as some traditional mod devices are being redesigned to resemble smaller modern pod devices. Additional model training would be required to enable further deep learning image analyses to conduct the following tasks: more precise gender detection of blurred images and recognition of full- body background, identication of faces obscured by smoke, prediction of more than one class in a single image, and integration of post image pixels and post texts to evaluate compliancewiththeFDArequirementstoaddwarninglabelsand sponsorshipdisclosures. To assess Instagram-user engagement with vaping posts we focused on \"like\" count as a surrogate for Instagram- user engagement with vaping posts; however a \"like\" does not necessarilyindicateauser'sapprovaloforsupportfore-cigar ette use. Still, since \"likes\" are often perceived by adolescent u sers as determinants of appropriate social behavior ( Sherman et al., 2017), the exposure to social media vaping images with many \"likes\" could be interpreted by youth as a signal of approval of ariskybehavior,e.g.,vaping. Wedidnotcalculateengagementrates( Canning,2018;Plann, 2019). Engagement rate per post depends on the follower count of the poster, data which were not available in our samples Frontiers in Communication | www.frontiersin.org 9 January 2020 | Volume 4 | Article 75Vassey et al. Measuring E-Cigarette Influence on Instagram due to 80%oftheposts.Asdata-accesspoliciesonsocial media platforms grow increasingly restricted, collaborati ons between platforms like Instagram and academic institutions will be necessary to conduct ethical, responsible, and useful res earch abouttheimpactsofsocialmedia. Ourinterviewsandfocusgroupsindicatethatthefollowersof Instagram vaping accounts might represent a subculture of avi d enthusiasts, who enjoy watching vape tricks and monitoring t he latestmodelsofvapingdevices(mostly modsthatproducevaping clouds). This group of enthusiasts may not be representative of most young e-cigarette users (including the teenagers targ eted by the FDA campaign) who tend to prefer consumer-oriented devises like JUUL pods(and other non-sub ohm devices) ( Matt, 2018;Tolentino,2018 ).Furtherstudyiswarrantedtocharacterize the broader influence of social media marketing on youth e- cigarette use: by measuring the attention that youth pay to vaping advertising, by analyzing the emotional intensity of young people reacting to these stimuli, and by conducting focu s groups and surveys among diverse groups of adolescents to gauge their perceptions of this content. Likewise, because ou r analysis of the initial impact of the FDA campaign was based on a limited number of Instagram comments and responses from a small number of focus group participants from one location of Berkeley, CA, a more comprehensive study of the eect of the campaign in middle and high schools ( The U.S. Food Drug Administration, 2018a ) is warranted. Finally, further studyiswarrantedtoincludeinterviewswithalargernumbe rof vapinginfluencers.

Frontiers in Communication | www.frontiersin.org 13 January 2020 | Volume 4 | Article 75Clinical Infectious DiseasesBRIEF REPORT CID 2018:XX (XX XXXX) 1 Increased Risk of Late-onset Streptococcus pneumoniae Meningitis in Adults With Prior Head or Spine Surgeries Victoria Chu,1,2 Diane M. Carpenter ,3 Kathleen Winter ,2 Kathleen Harriman,2 and Carol Glaser1 1Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, 2California Department of Public Health, Richmond, and 3Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Oakland, California In a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult population, prior head or spine surgery was associated with increased Streptococcus pneumoniae meningi- tis outside of the postoperative period (no prior head or spine surgery; odds ratio, 6.0 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-18.6]). Among the cases, only 33.3% had received any is a severe illness with chan- ging epidemiology over the last 2 decades as a result of the intro- duction of pneumococcal vaccines. Currently, 57% of bacterial meningitis cases are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [1]. Although inva- sive pneumococcal is due to a small subset of serotypes included in the 2 pneumococcal vaccines used in the United States [2]. Known risk factors for IPD among adults that are also indica- tions for pneumococcal vaccination include immunocompromis-ing conditions; asplenia; renal disease; smoking; cochlear implants; and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks [3 ]. However, there are a number of case reports of pneumococcal meningitis occurring in patients many years after a head injury (HI), presumably as a result of an injury-related cranial defect [4-6]. A retrospective review of 2013-2014 California hos- pital discharge data found that individuals with prior HI or brain surgery had an increased risk of pneumococcal meningitis [7 ]. cine (PCV13) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) are routinely recommended for all persons 65 years of age [8]. Adults aged 19-64 years with specific risk factors are also rec-ommended to receive 1 or both pneumococcal vaccines [3, 6]. The objective of this study was to determine whether prior HI or head or spine surgery (H/SS) is associated with pneumo-coccal meningitis among adults. Healthy US children have been recommended to receive 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vac- cine since it was introduced in 2000; PCV13 was recommended in 2010. Therefore, most of the current healthy adult population is unvaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal vaccination coverage among high-risk adults aged 19-64 years old is suboptimal. In 2016, coverage in this group was estimated at 24%; coverage among adults 65 years old was 67% [9]. METHODS This case-control study was conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Potential cases were patients 18 years of age with an International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision diagnosis of bacte- rial or pneumococcal meningitis between 1 January 2008 and 31 October 2017. Cases were included if they had (1) a posi- tive CSF culture for S. pneumoniae , or (2) CSF white blood cell count >10 leukocytes/L and a positive blood culture or pol-ymerase chain reaction (PCR) for S. pneumoniae within the same hospitalization. Exclusion criteria included oncologic or rheumatologic conditions with immunosuppressive treatment within 3 months prior to the date of the positive culture or PCR, asplenia, human immunodeficiency virus infection, the pres-ence or history of cochlear implants, or the presence or history of an intracranial shunt. Controls were matched 2:1 to cases by age, sex, KPNC facility, and KPNC membership length. A blinded medical record review was performed for cases and controls to identify HI and H/SS history, comorbidities, and pneumococcal vaccination history. HIs were defined as concus-sions, facial fractures, and skull fractures. H/SSs were defined as any surgical history involving the skull or the spine such as nasal surgery, mastoidectomy, or posterior spinal fusions. Patients aged 19-64 years with clinical indications for pneumo-coccal vaccination were considered \"high-risk\" patients. The association between each individual demographic char - acteristic, clinical characteristic, and history of HI or H/SS and case (pneumococcal meningitis) status was evaluated using sep- arate bivariate conditional logistic regression models. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). RESULTS Eighty-four patients 18 years of age with pneumococcal men-ingitis were identified and matched with 168 controls. The BRIEF REPORT \u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Comorbidities did not differ significantly among cases and controls. Two of the 84 (2.4%) cases had recurrent episodes of meningitis. One patient had 2 episodes of otogenic meningitis, both occurring >20 years prior, and a more recent mastoidectomy 6 years prior to the meningitis episode in 2013. The other patient had 2 episodes of meningitis during the study period, and was found to have chronic right CSF otorrhea with multiple skull base defects in the middle fossa floor, thought to be secondary to repeat episodes of mastoiditis. Fifteen of the 84 (17.9%) cases and 6 of the 168 (3.6%) con- trols had prior HI or H/SS (Table 1). Cases had 5.6 times higher odds of having a history of HI or H/SS (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-12.89). Separately, the odds remained significantly elevated for H/SS (odds ratio [OR], 6.0 [95% CI, 1.94-18.60]), but not for HI (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, .50-17.95]). HI consisted of concussions only as no facial or skull fractures were identified. The median time period between HI or H/SS and pneumococ-cal meningitis onset was 5 years (range, 0-30 years) among the 15 cases with HI or H/SS. Prior H/SS procedures were aneurysm clip (1), chordoma excision craniopharyngioma (1), decompres- sive laminectomies of the thoracic and lumbar regions (4, of which also included thoracic and/or lumbar fusions), encepha-locele removal (1), encephalocele removal and cribriform plate defect repair with a known CSF leak (1), nasal septoplasty (2), and unknown (1).The nasal septoplasties and decompressive laminectomies were elective. No known CSF leaks were present postoperatively in any patients; the patient with the cribriform plate defect had subsequent CSF leak studies that were negative. One case developed pneumococcal meningitis during the postoperative period (defined as within 30 days of the proce- dure) and was symptomatic on postoperative day 1 after an elective nasal septoplasty. No active infection was present at Table 1.

The second mastoidectomy was performed 8 years prior to the meningitis incident, and additional information regarding the surgical indication and presence of active infection at the time of that surgery was unavailable. Twenty-eight (33.3%) cases and 70 (41.7%) controls had received at least 1 dose of a pneumococcal vaccine; almost all doses were PPSV23 (Table 1). Among high-risk patients 19-64 years old, 7 of 18 cases (38.9 %) and 15 of 38 (39.5%) con-trols received at least 1 dose of a pneumococcal vaccine. Among those 65 years old, 19 of 31 (61.3%) cases and 47 of 61 (77.0%) controls received at least 1 dose of PPSV23. Two case patients (1 high-risk patient between the ages of 19 and 64 years, and 1 patient 65 years old) received PPSV23 vaccine <2 weeks prior to their meningitis diagnosis. There was no significant difference in pneumococcal vaccination status between cases and con- trols when stratified by age and vaccination indication. Because S. pneumoniae serotyping was not performed, it is unclear if any vaccinated cases had vaccine-preventable infections. DISCUSSION A history of H/SS was associated with significantly increased odds of developing pneumococcal meningitis among this adult population. Large studies for neurosurgery and SS have identified acute, postoperative central nervous system infection rates to be approximately 1%-10% and 0.2%-2.1%, respectively [10, 11]. In our study, case who underwent H/SS developed postop-erative pneumococcal meningitis, consistent with the incidence rate from the literature. Our results suggest that a history of H/SS increases the pneumococcal meningitis risk far beyond the postoperative period. Traumatic injury to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been shown to lead to BBB dysfunction years after the initiating event [12]. A direct anatomic connection from the naso-pharynx to the intracranial compartment resulting from prior head surgery, and transient bacteremia leading to meningitis via a dysfunctional BBB, could explain the increased risk of pneumo- coccal meningitis seen in patients with prior H/SS. Concussion was not found to be significantly associated with the development of meningitis. While pneumococcal meningitis is a rare condition, our sample size was adequate for many statistical comparisons. However, the study was underpowered for a close analysis of HI and H/SS types. No patients had a history of facial and skull fractures; therefore, it was not possible to evaluate the risk of these types of HIs. Childhood concussions may not have been documented, although incomplete documentation should have been similar for cases and controls.This is the first published study demonstrating an associa- tion between a history of H/SS and pneumococcal the 30-day postoperative period. men- ingitis, is largely a vaccine-preventable disease [2]. Among both cases and controls aged 19-64 years with clinical indications for pneumococcal vaccination, less than half of the patients had been vaccinated. This study emphasizes the need for provider education to improve overall adult pneumococcal vaccination rates. Given the significantly increased OR, H/SS should be considered as a potential risk factor for pneumococcal men-ingitis among adults. Additional investigations are needed to confirm these results, as this was a relatively small study. Future investigations are also needed to explore the risk of facial and skull fractures, as well as the risk of developing other neuroin-fectious diseases in persons with prior H/SS. In the meantime, pneumococcal vaccination is a safe and efficacious intervention, and we would recommend vaccinating patients with prior or upcoming elective H/SS, particularly if they are in a risk group already recommended for vaccination.

This study assesses direct dispensed naloxone availability through pharmacy chains in California in 2016, and utilizes spatial analysis techniques to suggest optimal stocking of naloxone. Rural counties were less likely to have a pharmacy selling naloxone even though overdose death rates were higher in rural counties (odds ratio [OR] = 0.225; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.059, 0.854]). Pharmacies closest to the center of the population in these rural counties were identified as ideal stocking locations. Rural counties with high overdose death rates have the lowest rates of naloxone, but spatial analysis can determine pre-existing chain pharmacies that can stock naloxone. Keywords naloxone, mapping, pharmacy, geospatial, rural Introduction The opioid epidemic and opioid-associated mortality within the United States has recently gained increasing attention as a public health crisis due to the skyrocketing number of opioid overdose deaths with a 200% increase since 2000 (Paulozzi et al., 2011; Rudd et al., 2016). Strategies to reduce mortality from the opioid epidemic have taken multimodal approaches including harm reduction methods, such as opioid overdose reversal with naloxone. Naloxone hydrochloride is a \u00b5-opioid receptor competitive antagonist that quickly reverses opioid effects temporarily, and thus prevents respiratory depression and death due to an opioid overdose (Beheshti et al., 2015). Historically, naloxone was only administered in medical facilities; however, over the last two decades, liberalizing naloxone access has been used as a means of community harm reduction in the opioid epidemic. Previously this was limited to first responders and community distribution programs, and access had been concentrated in urban areas (Hawk et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2015). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) have recommended the use of naloxone, a common opioid reversal agent, to reduce opioid 1University of California, Berkeley, USA 2Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, CA, USA Corresponding Author: Somalee Banerjee, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaiser Foundation Hospital, 3600 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94611, USA. Email: IssuesBanerjee research-article 2020 Banerjee 605 overdose risk (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015). Recent evidence has highlighted the increased burden of opioid-related morbidity and mortality in rural communities with a persistent lack of access to medications for treatment of opioid use disorder (Haffajee et al., 2019). Naloxone distribution through pharmacy chains can be a means to ensure greater access in rural areas. Pharmacy chains with a pervasive presence in urban and rural areas around the country are well poised to deliver this life-saving intervention in the most needy communities. To expand access to naloxone, the U.S. FDA (2015) fast-tracked the 2015 approval of an easy- to-use nasal spray and an auto-injector version for naloxone that can be dispensed from outpatient pharmacies. Since 2012, most states have passed naloxone access laws that allow for patients who use opioid and their close contacts to buy naloxone directly from pharmacies with trained pharma-cists through universal standing prescription programs (Davis, 2015). However, even in states with more established standing prescription naloxone programs, availability is far from universal. Recent studies in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania reported naloxone stocking rates of only 45% and 8.7%, respectively (Burrell et al., 2017; Stopka et al., 2017). In 2014, the governor of California signed AB 1535, the Pharmacy Naloxone bill, into law to allowed over the counter (OTC) sale of naloxone throughout the state through standing prescriptions (Drug Policy Alliance, 2014). In 2015, a large pharmacy chain started carrying standing order dispensed naloxone with an initial rollout of only 58 of the 867 chain pharmacies carrying naloxone with plans to expand across the state (Drug Policy Alliance, 2015, n.d.). Prior studies have explored the optimal routes of prehos-pital naloxone distribution with mixed results (Dworkis et al., 2018). Recently, geospatial map-ping techniques have begun to be used to study to optimize the planning of resource deployment for the opioid epidemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], n.d.; Dodson et al., 2018). There is limited evidence regarding optimal spatial distribution of direct naloxone avail-ability through retail pharmacies. A spatially directed effort to improve distribution of direct dis-pensation naloxone in pharmacy chains can efficiently get naloxone into the hands of people who can prevent the next opioid overdose death. This study will assess the spatial distribution of early wave standing order naloxone availability in a large pharmacy retailer chain in California, particu-larly rural areas with high opioid-associated mortality, to determine how to best focus resources in rural areas with the greatest need for access to naloxone. Materials and Methods Study Population and Data Sources The patient population studied included adults who died in the state of California from 2000 to 2014, as this time period included the greatest rate of increase of opioid-related deaths in the country (Rudd et al., 2016). Opioid overdose death data were obtained from the open source CDC Multiple Causes of Death 1999-2014 database, with mortality data based on death certifi-cates in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Dodson et al., 2018). For the purposes of this analysis, counties with deaths less than 10 total per year were reported as 0. Opioid overdose deaths were identified as deaths with cause listed as tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10) codes under T40: poisoning by opioids and other psychedelics. Four specific years of data were illustrated for at regular intervals for clarity over time, however data from 2014 only was used for the detailed regression analysis described below. Boundary data for mapping counties within California were obtained from the government of California (CDC, n.d.). Census data from the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) (U.S. Census Bureau & Social Explorer, 2015) were utilized to determine demo-graphic characteristics per county (California Open Data, 2019). The baseline demographic char - acteristics studied included total county population and categorical variables defining age, race, gender, employment status, median income, health insurance status, and inequality within the 606 Journal of Drug Issues 50(4) county as measured by the Gini Index. The urban/rural nature of a county was defined using the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, n.d.) urban-rural classification scheme for counties in 2014. Urban areas were defined as counties with largely metropolitan areas, while rural areas were defined as nonmetropolitan areas according to NCHS classifications. Locations for the 58 pharmacies stocking standing order naloxone in 2016 in California were obtained through open source data obtained via phone survey by The Drug Policy Alliance, and were defined as pharma-cies that confirmed that naloxone was available for purchase at the facility without any individual provider prescription (Weaver et al., 2018). Geographical data for these pharmacies were extrap-olated through geo-locating the pharmacies with a Google Maps Application Programming Interface. Outcomes and Data Analysis Opioid death data in total opioid deaths and crude death rates by population per county were joined and mapped using Quantum GIS (QGIS) for the years 2000, 2005, 2009, and 2014 to illustrate the periodic change in death associated with opioids over the state. These years were chosen as interval markers during the acute worsening of the opioid epidemic with 2009 marking a significant inflection point in the rate of increase of opioid-related deaths per the CDC (Rudd et al., 2016). MATLAB (Natick, MA, USA) was used for spatial data analysis. Pharmacies claim-ing standing order naloxone availability in 2016 were mapped, and their presence in counties with high need was determined. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to exam-ine the likelihood of counties having a pharmacy selling standing order naloxone with the pri-mary outcome of the crude death rate per county from 2014. Demographic characteristics noted above were used as covariates to adjust these models. Counties with high need were defined using histograms of total deaths and death rates. If a chain pharmacy stocking OTC naloxone was not present in one of these high need counties, the population-weighted centroids of these coun-ties were determined. The centroid was determined using census tract population data of each census tracts within the county and finding the population weighted mean latitude and longitude point. The closest existing pharmacy per Google Maps data to that centroid as measured by the shortest geographical distance was identified as the suggested location to expand standing order naloxone stocking and advertising. This study was determined to be exempt from review by the University of California, Berkeley institutional review board. Results Spatial Distribution of Overdose Deaths and Naloxone Availability The distribution of drug overdose deaths in California has overall increased substantially since 2000. The largest increases in overdose deaths were in the more rural counties in northern California that have some of the highest rates of overdose deaths in the state (Figure 1). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted to ascertain characteristics associated with the likelihood of a county having a pharmacy with standing order naloxone within its bound-aries. There was no significant association between rates of opioid overdose death rates and the odds of having a pharmacy carrying standing order naloxone (odds ratio [OR] = 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.821, 1.427]). As suggested by the spatial results (Figure 2), rural counties as determined by NCHS classification had lower odds of having a pharmacy selling standing order naloxone (OR = 0.330, 95% CI = [0.146, CI = [0.059, 0.854]. Multivariate logistic regression did not show any significant association between naloxone-carrying pharmacy locations and the following demographic factors in the area: White race, median income, insurance status, higher education attainment, inequality, or unemployment.Banerjee 607 Optimization of Naloxone Availability Counties with high naloxone need were defined by identifying clear outliers with the highest number and rates of deaths due to drug overdose. A few outlier counties accounted for the highest rates of drug-related deaths (Figure 3). The thresholds of greater than 100 total deaths per county and 10 deaths per 100,000 people per county were used as the definition for counties with high Figure 2.

The counties with the highest total death counts already had early introduction of standing order naloxone, and these counties had larger more urban populations. However, four of the six counties with the highest need as defined by high crude death rates did not have pharma-cies selling standing order naloxone. In the two counties with high needs with existing availabil-ity of naloxone, the pharmacies carrying naloxone were already near the centroid of population. To determine the optimal pharmacy to carry naloxone, we located the pharmacy closest to this population centroid in the following four counties in Northern California: Lake, Humboldt, San Joaquin, and Shasta counties. The optimal pharmacies are shown in Figure 4. Discussion Rural counties in California are currently suffering from the worst of the ravages of the opioid epidemic, but the initial roll out of standing order pharmacies through a pharmacy chain was not concentrated in these areas of highest need. Pharmacies with naloxone in stock to be dispensed through standing order prescriptions were more likely to be located in urban areas, with rural areas being neglected despite the higher rates of opioid associated deaths in rural areas. No other clear socioeconomic indicators were found to be associated with the likelihood of a county hav-ing a naloxone carrying pharmacy. It is likely that pharmacies in urban areas were targeted to carry naloxone due to an increased concentration of resources and perceived demand in urban areas. This study illustrates the benefits of using spatial analyses as an aid to evidence-based decision-making regarding where to emphasize stocking and advertising of standing order nalox-one. Training and stocking resources can be concentrated in the suggested pharmacies that are already present in the rural counties that lack access. The results from this study echo previous evidence showing a greater increase in rates of opi- oid overdose deaths in rural areas compared with urban areas nationwide (Gupta et al., 2016; Keyes et al., 2014; Paulozzi & Xi, 2008). Suggested factors contributing to this geographic dif-ference in opioid use include greater environmental stressors and availability of opioid prescrip-tions in rural areas (Keyes et al., 2014). In California, Cerda et al. (2017), found a spread of more rural opioid overdose hotspots to urban areas with rural hotspots associated with increases in opioid prescriptions associated with workplace injuries. Standing order naloxone is one of the many approaches in stemming the increasing mortality from the opioid epidemic. Pharmacy chains have taken initiatives to help stem the opioid epidemic, Figure 3. Histograms of county drug death distribution highlighting the skew of death rates in 2014: (A) distribution of total counts of opioid deaths per county and (B) distribution of counts of crude opioid death rates per county.Banerjee 609 and are well poised to provide a large-scale intervention in rural areas where other community or governmental interventions may be lacking. However, without purposeful, evidence-based direc-tion of where to improve stocking, the current urban bias of naloxone availability may persist. Recent studies in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, where standing order naloxone has been avail-able for a longer time than California, show limited penetrance of naloxone availability in rural areas as previously mentioned (Burrell et al., 2017; Stopka et al., 2017). Since community organiza-tions that provide a bulk of the standing order naloxone are more frequently serving densely popu-lated urban areas, pharmacy stocking in rural areas could be a means to improve access to naloxone (Wheeler et al., 2015). Recent initiatives by the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services to promote provider prescriptions of naloxone with opioids could increase access to naloxone through co-prescribing standards that would increase the need for pre-scription outpatient naloxone as well (U.S. Census Bureau & Social Explorer, 2015). The role of pharmacies in harm reduction in opioids mirrors their role in syringe access pro- grams. Historically syringe exchange programs in the community were the most established Figure 4.

Suggested locations in the following counties: (A) Humboldt County, (B) San Joaquin County, and (C) Shasta County.610 Journal of Drug Issues 50(4) methods of harm reduction, but pharmacy sales have been suggested as a method for increasing access in rural areas (Beheshti et al., 2015). Syringe access programs continued to be concen-trated in more urban areas as compared with rural or suburban areas where the need is increasing (Wheeler et al., 2015). However, pharmacies in some states are increasing their stock with 97% of pharmacies in Massachusetts having syringe exchanges (Stopka et al., 2017). There could be a similar push to improve stocking of naloxone in rural and suburban pharmacies to match their communities' increasing needs especially because urban areas already have increased access to naloxone through community and provider driven initiatives. There is some debate on the safety of universal naloxone use through standing prescriptions, but the increasing evidence base shows significant opioid overdose reversals in the community without directly increasing opioid use (Beheshti et al., 2015; Doe-Simkins et al., 2014). The cost of naloxone may be significant barrier that improving access may not solve (Doe-Simkins et al., 2014). The future of naloxone use is also dependent on future policy as a roll back of current addiction treatment coverage laws could lead to a worsening in the opioid epidemic (Friedmann et al., 2017). This study does have limitations. First, our analyses focused on mapping early efforts of major pharmacy retailer in California, a state that has lower rates of opioid overdoses compared with other states, such as Kentucky and West Virginia. The results regarding factors associated with pharmacy availability of naloxone may not have full external validity, as no clear evidence was available from the pharmacy chain regarding their decision-making. Although more detailed geo-graphic data regarding opioid overdoses at the zip code level would lead to improved predictions about naloxone needs, these data are difficult to collect due to relatively low numbers in rural areas and the need for privacy. Pharmacy availability of naloxone was obtained through publicly available survey data from the Drug Policy Alliance, but temporal changes in the availability of naloxone was not captured and thus could not be included in the analyses. Rural counties in California have limited access to life saving naloxone through pharmacy chains even though they have some of the highest need. Since other community methods of nal-oxone delivery are also lacking in rural areas, these geographic regions may particularly benefit from policy focused on improving access to pharmacy-based standing order naloxone as large pharmacy retailers already have a presence in these areas. Spatial mapping methods provide an important tool that can assist large retail pharmacies as well as public health officials in focusing their efforts to areas of greatest need to maximize public health impact. This can lead to an inte-grated effort to improve naloxone advertising and training to increase public education about this live saving intervention.

To understand the successes in Rwanda and Australia, a comparative policy analysis was conducted based on key informant interviews and a review of peer- reviewed lit - erature and policy briefs. Notable findings were identified that offer lessons for coun - tries across the income spectrum. To address cervical cancer, low- and middle- income countries can leverage foreign aid, international collaboration, and strong political ad - vocacy, as Rwanda did. High- income countries can invest in translational research that builds capacity from basic science research to implementation of novel and impactful health products and services, as Australia did. All countries can consider rolling out HPV vaccination by targeting the social and/or physical environment (e.g., a school- based vaccination program, as both Rwanda and Australia did). Cervical cancer is pre - ventable, and eradication is within reach for countries across the income spectrum around the world. Cervical cancer screening programs are needed to minimize the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in the short term, and HPV vaccina - tion programs are the best strategy to eradicate cervical cancer in the long term. KEYWORDS Australia, cervical cancer, cervical cancer screening, HPV vaccination, policy analysis, Rwanda 1|INTRODUCTION Every year, 300 000 women die from cervical cancer, and 90% of these cases occur in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).1,2 Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papilloma - virus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted viral infection.3 Half of all HPV strains are \"high- risk\" for serious sequelae, and untreated high- risk HPV infections can result in cancer. Cervical cancer typi - cally appears many years after HPV infection. HPV also causes the majority of anal, vaginal, oropharyngeal, vulvar, and penile cancers.3 There are three facets of cervical cancer control (Figure 1): prevention, screening, and treatment.2 Prevention and screening are the two pathways to avert or treat cervical pre- cancer, mean - ing that cervical cancer incidence can be avoided altogether.Two countries, Rwanda and Australia, have made great strides to eradicate cervical cancer.4,5 Rwanda (an LMIC) and Australia (a high- income country) therefore provide case stud - ies of successful widespread cervical cancer eradication efforts. This paper aims to understand the successes in Rwanda and Australia, and to share lessons learned for countries across the income spectrum. This policy analysis first provides an overview of HPV vacci - nation and cervical cancer screening and then applies two policy analysis tools, Kingdon's policy window model and the force field analysis, to understand the specific strategies employed in Rwanda and Australia. It then closes with recommendations for other coun - tries to improve their capacities for HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. 2| KRAMER 1.1 | HPV vaccination There are several vaccines that can prevent high- risk HPV strains. HPV for (respectively) two, four, and nine HPV strains.6 The availability of these vaccine types varies by country and facility. The HPV vaccination is most effective when ad - ministered to a person before their first exposure to HPV during sexual activity, and the WHO recommends adolescent girls (between 9 and 14 years old) as the priority group for HPV vaccination. 7 The HPV vaccine is safe and effective at preventing a person from contracting high- risk HPV, and the vaccine is predicted to re - duce cervical cancer deaths by up to 76%.8,9 Despit e the high e f - fectiveness of the HPV vaccine, uptake remains limited around the world.10 Global public concerns about the HPV vaccine include side effects, safety, efficacy, interactions, and the potential of HPV vac - cination to promote sexual activity.10 These concerns have been largely proven to be unfounded.10 LMICs face additional constraints in implementing HPV vaccination, including the challenge of creat - ing a vaccine delivery infrastructure within existing health systems and of ensuring the long- term sustainability of HPV vaccine pro - grams. 11,12 Since the HPV vaccination was introduced in 2006, there has been an increase in the number of national HPV vaccination programs, but these programs tend to be located in higher- income countries, where the burden of cervical cancer is lower.10 1.2 | Cervical cancer screening There are several cervical cancer screening methods, including cervical smear, HPV DNA screening, colposcopy, and visual inspec - tion with acetic acid (VIA) or with Lugol's iodine (VILI).13 Cervical smear requires a laboratory and a well- trained analyst, usually a pathologist, to perform cytology testing. HPV DNA testing looks for the presence of HPV DNA in a woman's sampled cervical cells. Colposcopy requires a high- powered microscope that a highly trained practitioner uses to view a patient's magnified cervix to look for precancerous lesions and abnormalities. VIA and VILI are used in \"screen- and- treat\" approaches, where a trained practitioner can see if a patient's cervix appears precancerous, and then treat them on the spot by using carbon dioxide gas to freeze off (cryotherapy), by applying heat to burn off (thermocoagulation), or by using an electri - fied wire to cut out suspected deeper precancerous lesions (loop electrosurgical excision procedure). Cervical cancer screening remains limited in LMICs. The cervical smear, HPV DNA testing, and colposcopy pose resource challenges, including high costs, reliance on a laboratory, and/or reliance on highly trained practitioners. 1 4 - 1 6 Visual inspection methods (VIA and VILI) are recommended for use in LMICs but uptake remains limited because of a lack of healthcare providers who are trained in admin - istering and interpreting a visual examination. 13,17 2|METHODS The objectives of this policy analysis are to: (1) describe the con - text of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening, (2) analyze effective policy strategies to eradicate cervical cancer in Rwanda and Australia, and (3) propose recommended policy interventions to eradicate cervical cancer globally. To address these objectives, several activities were completed. First, a literature review was conducted to understand strategies employed in Rwanda and Australia to eradicate cervical cancer. Second, a member of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases Division of the Rwandan Ministry of Health and a member of Australia's Cancer Council New South Wales were interviewed. These key informant interviews do not constitute human- subject research and therefore institutional review board approval was not sought. Third, Kingdon's policy window model was applied, and a force field analysis was con - ducted in order to understand the key policy strategies employed in Rwanda and Australia. Kingdon's policy window model posits that there are three \"streams\" of events related to an issue that oper - ate largely independently: the problem stream (scope of the issue), the processes stream (availability or paucity of solutions), and the politics stream (political will). When these streams coincide, the im - portance and urgency of the issue are magnified, a \"policy window\" opens, and there is an opportunity to successfully implement a new policy strategy. 18 The force field analysis, originally developed by Lewin,19 maps the driving and restraining forces of a policy strategy. A policy strategy can be successfully implemented when the drivers outweigh the restraints. Fourth, the similarities and differences in Rwanda's and Australia's approach were compared and recommen - dations were developed for other countries to eradicate cervical cancer. 3|RESULTS 3.1 | Strategies to eradicate cervical cancer in Rwanda Rwanda is a low- income country in sub- Saharan Africa with a popu - lation of 12.6 million people.20 In 1 994, Rwanda suffered a devas - tating genocide that killed over 1 million people and destroyed the FIGURE 1Three facets of cervical cancer controlPrimaryP KRAMER country's infrastructure, including their health system. Following the genocide, the Rwandan government introduced a new constitution and focused on rebuilding the health system with an equity agenda, strengthening infrastructure and delivery of care. 21 Specifically, Rwanda focused on improving maternal and child health.22 3.1.1 | HPV vaccination in Rwanda In 2011, the age- standardized incidence rate of cervical can - cer in Rwanda was 34.5 cases per 100 000 women, and the age- standardized mortality rate was 25.4 cases per 100 000 women.23 Cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer death among Rwandan women. Beginning in 2009, the First Lady of Rwanda, Jeannette Kagame, began to advocate for HPV vaccinations and lobbied the pharmaceutical company Merck to provide free HPV vaccinations in Rwanda. 23 The Minister of Health at the time, Agnes Binagwaho, wrote that \"the Ministry of Health considered the over - whelmingly positive evidence of the effectiveness of the HPV vac - cine to be a call to action\".24 In 2010, Merck and Rwanda's Ministry of Health jointly developed a national cervical cancer prevention strategy. The target population to receive the HPV vaccination was girls aged 9- 14 years (per WHO guidelines), 7 and the Ministry of Health felt that the only way to reach most girls within their target age group was to vaccinate girls in school.* Therefore, HPV vaccina - tion was introduced in Rwanda in 2011 in a school- based program targeted at sixth- grade girls. The Ministry of Health coordinated with the Ministry of Education and with teachers to effectively implement HPV vaccinations.* The national HPV vaccination pro - gram achieved 93% coverage of the full three- dose HPV vaccination schedule among sixth- grade girls.24 This effort was the first HPV vaccination program in Africa.25 These events are shown in Figure 2. There were several drivers of success in the development and implementation of the HPV vaccination program in Rwanda (Figure 3). First, the government built upon Rwanda's rich history of vaccination. Since 2000, Rwanda has achieved 92% vaccination cov - erage in children under 5 years of age for major vaccine- preventable diseases.26 Second, the government demonstrated strong political leadership in partnering with Merck and in coordinating across the health and education sectors to successfully implement the vaccina - tion program. Third, Rwanda has an extremely well- attended school system, and 93% of all eligible sixth- grade girls were in school during the vaccination campaign.24 Fourth, Rwanda has a unique culture of performance evaluation: as a group of authors analyzing Rwanda's successes in childhood vaccination coverage note, \"the uniquely Rwandan practice of imihigo , which involves leaders at all levels of government (centrally and locally) signing performance contracts to achieve certain targets, enhances accountability and ownership\". 27 Fifth, the government engaged in a media \"sensitization\" campaign before implementing the HPV vaccination which informed the public of the need for vaccination in their local language.* There were several restraints in the development and implementa - tion of the HPV vaccination program in Rwanda (Figure 3). First, there were difficulties in navigating multiple partners, including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, teachers, community health workers, and Merck. Second, mobilizing resources (especially supplies and community health workers) to all Rwandan schools was difficult and required significant planning. Third, although Merck covered the cost of all three HPV vaccination doses, the cost of logistics (e.g., co - ordinated sensitization, mobilization of resources) was still quite high. 3.1.2 | Cervical cancer screening in Rwanda Before the implementation of HPV vaccination in Rwanda, no formal cervical cancer screening program existed in the country. In 2013, Rwanda's Ministry of Health built on the success of the HPV vac - cination program and developed a comprehensive national cervical cancer screening plan. 23 According to the plan, screening would be FIGURE 2Kingdon's three streams leading to the creation of a national HPV vaccination program in Rwanda (highlighted in yellow) FIGURE 3Force field analysis of the national HPV vaccination program in Rwanda 4| KRAMER decentralized across 30 public hospitals and 100 health centers and would include HPV DNA screening (with donated equipment) and VIA. Currently, there are limited data on the implementation or the effectiveness of the national cervical cancer screening plan. 4 Given the lack of available information, Rwanda's cervical cancer screening program was not analyzed here. 3.1.3 | Current state of cervical cancer in Rwanda Since the initial 2011 HPV vaccination campaign, Rwanda's govern - ment has continued to vaccinate sixth- grade girls in schools. Merck continued to pay for three HPV vaccination doses for all sixth- grade girls in Rwanda through 2014.23 Since 2014, Gavi has paid for HPV vaccinations in Rwanda, and Rwanda switched from a three- dose HPV vaccination schedule to a two- dose schedule.23 Currently, the age- standardized incidence rate of cervical cancer in Rwanda is 31.9 cases per 100 000 women, and the age- standardized mortality rate is 24.1 death per 100 000 women.1 This is a slight improvement from 2011 (34.5 cases per 100 000 women, 25.4 deaths per 100 000 women).23 Given the long gap between HPV infection and cervical cancer, the rate of cervical cancer in Rwanda is expected to drop significantly over the next several decades as the girls who have been vaccinated since 2011 grow older. 3.2 | Strategies to eradicate cervical cancer in Australia Australia is a high- income country with a population of 25.3 million people.20 Australia is an exemplar of healthcare quality and access, providing universal health insurance and offering free or low- cost access to public hospitals for Australian residents.28 3.2.1 | Cervical cancer screening in Australia In the late 1980 s, a study commissioned by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council found that an organized cervical can - cer screening approach could prevent 90% of cervical cancer in the country.29 At the time, the age- standardized incidence rate of cervical cancer was 13.3 cases per 100 000 women and the age- standardized mortality rate was 2.7 deaths per 100 000 women.30,31 In 1991, Australia introduced a national cervical screening program to realize the goals put forth by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council report. 29 The program encouraged eligible women to be screened for cervical cancer every 2 years. The national screen - ing program also set up a cervical smear infrastructure across the country, including cervical smear \"registers\" for data collection. 29 The introduction of a national cervical screening program spurred a surge of research on cervical cancer and HPV in Australia.In 2017, Australia's government revised the national screening program to move away from the cervical smear towards HPV DNA testing. This change was made, in part, to better complement the national HPV vaccination program implemented in 2007. 32 The new program recommends HPV DNA testing every 5 years, as opposed to cervical smear testing every 2 years. The HPV DNA screening ap - proach was found to be more effective at catching cervical pre- cancer and more cost- effective than the cervical smear in Australia.33 These events are marked with \"AuS\" (Australia Screening) in Figure 4. There were several drivers of success in the development and implementation of the cervical screening program in Australia (Figure 5). First, Australia's universal healthcare system enables ac - cess to cervical cancer screening, as most patients do not pay to re - ceive screening. Second, the universal healthcare system incentivizes the government to invest in prevention instead of treatment efforts. The government is the primary payer of health care, and screening is FIGURE 4Kingdon's three streams leading to the creation of a national cervical screening program (AuS, highlighted in yellow) and a national HPV vaccination program (AuV, highlighted in yellow) in Australia FIGURE 5Force field analysis of the national cervical screening program in Australia |5 KRAMER more cost- effective than cancer treatment. Third, the health system has a strong network of general practitioners (GPs), and these GPs act as a patient's first point- of- contact to the rest of the health system.28 When the government established a national cervical screening pro - gram, GPs were well- positioned to take on the responsibility of in - forming their patients of the need to receive regular cervical cancer screening and of administering cervical cancer screening to patients. There were a few restraints in the development and implemen - tation of the cervical screening program in Australia (Figure 5). First, the national cervical screening program did not reach all women in Australia equitably. Australia's indigenous population remains underserved in the national cervical screening program. This high - lights inequities in recruitment and in providing access to treatment following a positive screening result. 29 Second, the advent of HPV vaccination created a false sense of security and an untrue belief that cervical cancer screening is not required for women who have received the HPV vaccination. 29 3.2.2 | HPV vaccination in Australia The long- standing commitment to cervical cancer screening in Australia led to a surge of research into cervical cancer and HPV. Dr. Ian Frazer and his colleague Dr. Jian Zhou developed the HPV vaccine in Australia, and filed an Australian patent for the HPV vac - cination in 1991. 34 The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first HPV vaccination in 2006.35 Australia then consulted ex - perts and considered the cost- effectiveness of the vaccine before launching the world's first national HPV vaccination program in April 2007.36 This program prioritized vaccinating girls between 12 and 17 years old in schools, and achieved moderately high coverage, with 73% of 12- to 13- year- old girls, 72% of 14- to 15- year- old girls, and 66% of 16- to 17- year- old girls receiving a full three- dose HPV vac - cination schedule. These events are marked with \"AuV\" (Australia Vaccination) in Figure 4. There were several drivers of success in the development and implementation of the HPV vaccination program in Australia (Figure 6). Similar to the drivers of success in Australia's national cervical screening program, a universal healthcare system simulta - neously allows for Australians to receive the HPV vaccination free of charge and incentivizes the government to invest in early preven - tive efforts. Additionally, Australia's schools are well- attended, and the school- based vaccination program was built on Australia's his - tory of school- based vaccination programs, which dates back to the 1970s. 36 Finally, the program included a social marketing campaign aimed at educating adolescent girls and their mothers about the im - portance of the vaccination.36 There were also several restraints in the development and im - plementation of the HPV vaccination program in Australia (Figure 6). First, the parents of the adolescent girls receiving the vaccination needed to provide consent, which posed a significant logistical challenge to administering the vaccination during the school day. 36 Second, at the time there was low awareness that HPV was the cause of cervical cancer, which created a challenge in convincing people to receive the HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer. 36 3.2.3 | Current state of cervical cancer in Australia Since the launch of HPV vaccination in 2007, Australia has instituted HPV vaccination within the National Immunization Program, which provides vaccinations to eligible people for free. 37 Vaccinations are offered through schools (for 12- to- 13- year- olds),38 through GPs, through Aboriginal Medical Services, and through workplaces.39 Currently, the age- standardized incidence rate of cervical cancer is 6.0 cases per 100 000 people and age- standardized mortality rate is 1.7 deaths per 100 000 people.1 This is a substantial improvement from 1991 (13.3 cases per 100 000 people,30 2.7 deaths per 100 000 people31), effectively halving the incidence rate and decreasing mor - tality by a third. 4|DISCUSSION Rwanda and Australia offer critical lessons in cervical cancer eradi - cation. Rwanda demonstrates that a devastating tragedy offers an opportunity to rebuild a nation with intentionality, as shown by Rwanda's prioritization of health equity and maternal and child health following the 1994 genocide. Additionally, Rwanda received beneficial foreign aid from Merck and later Gavi, underscoring the utility of international collaboration and strong political advo - cacy by LMIC governments. Australia shows the manifold benefits of universal health care in enabling access to preventive health services and in incentivizing the government to invest in disease prevention and screening. Additionally, Australia exemplifies the benefits of investing in translational research: Australia's basic sci - ence research enabled the invention of the HPV vaccination and FIGURE 6Force field analysis of the national HPV vaccination program in Australia 6| KRAMER Australia was then the first country to implement a national HPV vaccination program. Rwanda and Australia shared success in school- based HPV vac - cination programs. A school- based vaccination program is an exam - ple of an \"environmental\" intervention, in that it seeks to facilitate HPV vaccination by changing the social and/or physical environment of HPV vaccination (i.e., it improves the accessibility of the vacci - nation location). 40 Environmental interventions have been found to be the most successful cervical cancer eradication strategies, but still must be accompanied by informational campaigns in order to address patient misconceptions about HPV and the vaccine. 40 Both Rwanda and Australia paired their HPV vaccination campaign with a sensitization or marketing campaign. The successes of Rwanda's and Australia's school- based vaccination programs demonstrate the effectiveness of environmental interventions to implement HPV vaccination. This policy analysis was confined primarily by limited data avail - able on the history and policy- making processes related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in Rwanda and Australia. Another limitation of this analysis was the limited number of key informant interviews conducted on the history and current prac - tices and policies regarding cervical cancer screening and HPV vac - cination in Rwanda and Australia. Additional key informants were identified, but the author was unable to successfully schedule an interview time with these informants, due in large part to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. 5|CONCLUSION This policy analysis describes how Rwanda and Australia have taken steps to become on track to eradicate cervical cancer. There are a range of strategies to address cervical cancer mortality, including prevention, screening, and treatment. Prevention through the HPV vaccination and screening through the cervical smear, HPV DNA testing, colposcopy, and visual inspection are pathways to avert cer - vical cancer incidence. A number of countries, including Rwanda and Australia, have successfully launched a national HPV vaccination program. Although there are limited data on the implementation and effectiveness of Rwanda's national cervical cancer screening plan, the success of Australia's cervical cancer screening demonstrates why screening remains crucial. The HPV vaccination is not 100% effective and there are significant parts of the populations of people in Rwanda and Australia not vaccinated against HPV and therefore are still at risk of developing cervical cancer. This analysis of cervical cancer eradication efforts in Rwanda and Australia gives rise to a number of policy recommendations for other countries around the world. Countries should consider school- based vaccination programs, as these programs target the WHO's highest priority age group. Additionally, countries should include strategies for reaching marginalized populations without access to health care or education. HPV vaccination programs are the best strategy to eradicate cervical cancer in the long term, and cervical cancer screening programs are needed to minimize the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in the short term. Rwanda and Australia found success applying an environmen - tal intervention for HPV vaccination, and researchers agree that this is an effective global policy. 11 Environmental interventions, like school- based vaccination, still pose challenges for global implemen - tation. These interventions rely on buy- in from policy makers at the national and/or local level. Environmental interventions to imple - ment HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening should be tailored for the specific context in which they are developed. Each country therefore must develop their own contextualized plan that builds on existing resources to improve HPV vaccination and cervi - cal cancer screening uptake. By sharing lessons learned from Rwanda and Australia, this pol - icy analysis is meant to provide inspiration for policy makers around the world to consider developing programs to eradicate cervical can - cer. Rwanda and Australia demonstrate that cervical cancer eradi - cation is within reach for countries around the world and across the income spectrum. To achieve cervical cancer eradication, high- level and country- specific policy action is needed.

Eradicating cervical cancer: Lessons learned from Rwanda and Australia. // Politics Opinion: As California reopens, do not forget these three mistakes on COVID -19 UCSF's Dr. Monica Gandhi and medical student Kyle Hunter reflect on California's handling of the pandemic Dr. Monica Gandhi, Kyle Hunter, MPH June 15, 2021Updated: June 15, 2021 8:35 a.m. California officially reopens Tuesday after 15 months of restrictions and lockdowns for the COVID -19 pande mic. California has done a great job in vaccine distribution and uptake, surpassing President Joe Biden's desired metric of 70% eligible residents receiving their first dose on May 31. However, the general perception that more restrictive measures throughout the pandemic kept Californians safe is not reflected in our difficult third surge , nor the mental health effects on California's child ren of prolonged school closures. On this reopening day, it is important to reflect on three mistakes California made in the hopes that more data -driven approaches can be applied to guide us safely out of the pandemic completely. School closures Californi a to this day officially has the lowest number of children back to full in -person learning of all 50 states. We have not budged from this last -place position despite data from multiple countries and places in our own ( Wisconsin , North Carolina , Utah , Chicago , New York City ) demonstrating the safety of in -person learning with mitigation procedures for children and staff. Even in households, children have a threefold lower chance of catching COVID -19 than adults and, if they do, are about half as likely to spread it . Unfortunately, despite article after article by California -based scientists on the safety of in -person learning (in local and national periodicals ), almost 80% of our students have not seen the inside of a classroom since March 2020. The depressing contrast of watching C alifornia's private schools reopen safely for nearly the entire year while public schools remained shuttered underscored the inequities that were deepened by basing decisions off models and metrics that did not reflect the true risk to students and educators. California students with the means to pay tuition or form private learning pods had a school year that approached normal. Those families who did not went without. 2 The most recent article we wrote from UCSF last week in the Wall Street Journal about school closures detailed the tragic mental health costs of this mistake California made towards our children. Data from hospitals in the Bay Area showed a 66- 75% increase among 10- to 17- year-olds screening positive for active or recent suicidal ideation from last year. California Department of Public Health (CDPH) data sh owed 134 youth under age 18 in California died by suicide in 2020, up 24% from 108 in 2019, and well above totals from 2017 and 2018 . Adult suicide rates were down by 11% concomitantly, speaking to additional stressors among children beyond the pandemic from losing support structures in schools. Our data was reflected in national CDC data released last week showing a 50% increase in emergency department visits for suicide attempts among American adolescents (mainly girls) during the pandemic. Despite publishing a blueprint that detailed metrics for normal school openings for the fall in the New York Times \u2014 which are metrics that we have already reached in California \u2014 the Los Angeles Unified School District proposed this week twice weekly testing and masking of children and teachers in the fall. Asymptomatic testing of children is not recommended in the yellow tier in Calif ornia, and we exited the tier -based system in our state today. The CDC recommends masking indoors only in areas of high community transmissi on and already indicated a plan to likely discontinue mask requirements for children indoors in the fall if community transmission sta ys low. California continuing the same mistakes around schools for the fall and signaling \"abnormal\" to our children may lead to ongoing mental health effects . Closing the outdoors On Dec. 3, during our third surge, California issued another stay -at-home order which closed large areas of the outside, including outside playgrounds and outdoor dining. However, closing the outdoors, based on how this virus disseminates, is not scientifically based. In fact, SARS -CoV -2 viral particles disperse effectively in the outside air . A study in Wuhan, China , which utilized careful contact tracing, discovered that just one of 7,324 infection events investigated was linked to outdoor transmission. An extensive review reported that the risk of outdoors transmission of the coronavirus is about 20 times lower than inside. In another analysis of over 232,000 infections in Ireland, only one case of COVID -19 in every thousand was traced to outdoor transmission. And an extensive review from the University of Canterbury last fall concluded that outdoor transmission is rare, citing the opportunity costs of not encouraging the public to congregate out doors for \"the potential impact on physical and mental health and wellbeing.\" Closing events like outdoor dining ma y have driven people inside during the holiday season , and California had a terrible third surge over the winter holiday. Many places, like British Columbia , kept the outside open as much as possible to allow for congregation and socialization. The principle of har m reduction is to reduce infections from a contagious pathogen by also acknowledging the real -world conditions that may require essential work to continue or people to want to see loved ones . California took a \"lockdownist\" approach, rather than one of harm reduction , which may have harmed small business owners and increased social isolation in our state more than others. Unmasking and embracing the effectiveness of vaccines 3 The revised CDC mask guidance May 13 stated that vaccinated people no longer needed to mask, inside or out. Although not messaged well, the backlash to this response and the hesitation by the public to embrace it is partially the fault of California's messaging around vaccines and masks. Masks, distancing, ventilation, testing and contact tracing are tools for COVID -19 mitigation. Vaccines and increasing population immunity are the solution. California not only has one of the highest rates of vaccination in the country, but, unfortunately, has natural immunity from our terrible third surge. One of the most comprehensive seroprevalence studies performed in the U.S. was performed by the CDPH and showed a 38% seroprevalence rate after our winter surge and before vaccines were being rolled out to the general population. Natural immunity and vaccinations are contributing to population immunity in our state, which is keeping our case and hospitalization rates low even as we graduate to less restrictive tiers. Low community transmission keeps our unvaccinated children safe, although our summer camp and school guidance has children down to the age of 2 still masking with low cases and hospitalizations for months across our state. Despite having some of the most amazi ng immunology- related research coming out of California (at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and UCSF ) showing the durability of the immune response to COVID- 19 and the effectiveness of the immune response against variants , California continues to message alarm over variants and test asymptomatic individuals after vaccination, despite the CDC recommending following symptomatic breakthroughs . The way through this communication challenge in California around the CDC guidance on May 13 was to message simply and with optimism. Vaccines work. Continuing to message fear undermi nes trust in the data we have around vaccine effectiveness, even against variants , and prevents people from returning to pur suing normal lives. The signaling of abnormal will continue to have effects on our schools and personal anxieties and California should step forth with optimism and confidence on the power of immunity to get us through this pandemic on this day of opening.
