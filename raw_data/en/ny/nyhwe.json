UN BON FONCTIONNEMENT UNE R\u00c9\u00c9VALUATION CONSTANTE DES NORMES ACCEPT\u00c9ES! English version A democracy is never a straight line. It is never predictive in its management or interpretation. A democracy is a wickedly problematic endeavor, as the lives of all citizens are at stake. The only thing that seems constant in a democracy, is change. To manage a democracy requires intelligence, humility and flexibility. A democracy is complicated, because different individuals will set their own criteria about what should be important in their lives. This can lead to conflict, misalignment, or public disagreements within the community. In a democracy, consensus is the most important value; therefore, to come to a consensus, various positions and opinions must be relentlessly confronted and analyzed. when policy adjustments are made promptly and publicly, then social and political disruption is minimized. In a democracy, the people do not sheepishly accept what the government tells them, as being the truth. Even assuming good faith, professional competence, and absence of conflicts of interest, people always must question their rulers. This must be the essential dialectic of democracy as a political system and social contract. Good democracy requires vigorous debate. There is no one \"certainty\". No single \"truth\". Any individual claiming to embody \"the truth\" is by definition no longer a practitioner of democracy The intellectual process of the practice of democracy requires constant external challenge and criticism to reach a working approximation of truth. Typically, autocratic and paternalistic people do not have the ability to maintain objectivity and they can function only as enforcer of their version of reality. Such people often resort to a form of crude binary thought - their version of the truth versus all alternatives. Those who disagree with them are in essence the enemy. These people incapable of tolerating democratic principles will censor, demean, and delegitimize those who advance or discuss alternative versions of officially endorsed ideas. They suppress any discussion and dissent which is critical for the democratic process to accurately discern evolving truth and inform effective public policy decisions. This must stop, before yet more avoidable, unnecessary suffering accrues in Gabon. Version fran\u00e7aise profond\u00e9ment probl\u00e9matique, car la de tous les La seule de communaut\u00e9.
