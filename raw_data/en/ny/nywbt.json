[Hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) can be caused by [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), other infectious agents, [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm), and other chemicals. The two viruses that most commonly infect the liver include: [Hepatitis A](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_a_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)virus [Hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm)virus Although their names are similar, these viruses are not related. They differ in the way they are transmitted from person to person and their ability to cause chronic infection. What causes hepatitis A and how is it transmitted? Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that is spread predominately through the fecal-oral route when small amounts of infected fecal matter are inadvertently ingested. Infected individuals shed large amounts of the virus in their [stool](https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm), starting about two weeks before symptoms present, and continue shedding the virus in their [stool](https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_and_texture_changes/symptoms.htm) for one to three months. - Close contact with an infected person increases the chances of contracting the virus. - Children are particularly [contagious](https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm)because they have lower standards of hygiene and may not appear sick. - The hepatitis A virus also may be spread by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated by infected individuals. - Much less commonly, contaminated needles or blood may spread hepatitis A. What are the signs and symptoms of hepatitis A? Some patients with hepatitis A infection have no symptoms, and these asymptomatic infections are more common in children. Most adults experience symptoms including: [nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm), - poor appetite, [abdominal pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm), [fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm), [jaundice](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm)(yellow eyes and skin), and [dark urine](https://www.medicinenet.com/dark_urine/symptoms.htm). Although the symptoms resolve over several weeks, [fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) can be prolonged. Rarely, [viral hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm) caused by hepatitis A can lead to liver failure, [coma](https://www.medicinenet.com/coma/article.htm), and death. Does hepatitis A stay with you for life? Hepatitis A does not cause chronic or persistent infection of the liver. Once a person has recovered from hepatitis A, he or she is immune to reinfection with hepatitis A for life. This is true because effective antibodies are developed against the hepatitis A virus. After infection with hepatitis A, these antibodies provide life-long protection against the virus. The ability of the body to make protective antibodies after infection with hepatitis A led researchers to develop [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) against the disease. What is the hep A vaccine schedule for adults? The Hepatitis A [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) is made of killed hepatitis A viruses and causes the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the hepatitis A virus. - In most vaccine recipients, antibodies start to develop immediately after the first dose but do not reach protective levels for 2 to 4 weeks. - A second dose of the vaccine is recommended at least six months after the first dose to provide prolonged protection. Two hepatitis A [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) are currently available in the United States ( [Havrix](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_a_vaccine-injection/article.htm) and [Vaqta](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_a_vaccine-injection/article.htm)). The vaccine is given as an injection into the deltoid muscle of the arm. Both Havrix and Vaqta provide high-level protection against hepatitis A. What is the hep A and B combo vaccine called? There is also a combination vaccine called hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a-vaccine injection ( [Twinrix](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a_vaccine-injectable/article.htm)) that protects against both hepatitis A and [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm). The dosing schedule for Twinrix is different from the other hepatitis A [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm) and requires three doses over six months. Does everyone need hepatitis A vaccine? In the United States, hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all children at one year of age. Vaccination also is recommended for individuals in high-risk settings. Examples include: [travelers](https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm)to developing countries, - men who have sex with men, - users of illicit [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm), - persons needing frequent blood products, and - people who have chronic [liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm). What are the negative effects of hepatitis A vaccine? Side effects of the hepatitis A vaccine usually are mild. Soreness at the site of injection is common. Less commonly, recipients may complain of [headaches](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm) or [fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm). Serious [allergic](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm) reactions are possible but are rare. What are other ways to protect against hepatitis A? A second option for protecting people against hepatitis A is to administer antibodies that are already programmed to attack the virus. When people donate blood, the part of the blood carrying antibodies (the 'immune globulin' fraction) can be separated. Because some blood donors are likely to have antibodies against the hepatitis A virus, pooled immune globulin from many donors is likely to contain antibodies against hepatitis A. This immune globulin can be injected into a person at risk for hepatitis A and will provide immediate but temporary protection against infection. Protection with immune globulin lasts two to four months depending on the dose. Immune globulin is used when immediate protection against hepatitis A is required. An example would be someone who is leaving immediately to travel to rural areas of a developing country. Such a [traveler](https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm) would also receive the hepatitis A vaccine but would not have time to develop antibodies before departure. Immune globulin sometimes is in short supply and should be used only when necessary. - If an unvaccinated person is exposed to hepatitis A, he or she should be given the vaccine or immune globulin as soon as possible. - The vaccine is used for exposed persons aged one to 40 years. - Immune globulin currently is recommended for exposed persons over the age of 40 years. These measures will reduce the risk that the exposed person will contract hepatitis A by 85% to 90% if given within two weeks of exposure.

[Hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hepatitis_b_picture/picture.htm) was previously referred to as \"serum hepatitis\" because it usually is spread by the transfer of infected blood or serum (for example, through needle sticks, blood transfusions, [hemodialysis](https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm), and [childbirth](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_pain_relief_options_for_birth/article.htm)). Hepatitis B also is spread through sexual intercourse and may be passed from mother to child. Inadvertent exposure to infected blood or body fluids may occur during tattooing, body piercing, or when sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person. Persons infected with hepatitis B may be asymptomatic or may develop fatigue, [jaundice](https://www.medicinenet.com/jaundice/symptoms.htm), and [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm). Rarely - though more commonly than with hepatitis A - acute infection with hepatitis B can cause liver failure and death. Does hepatitis B go away? Most infected adults are able to clear the hepatitis B virus from their body and become immune to further infections with hepatitis B. However, some people are not able to clear the hepatitis B virus and it progresses to chronic (persistent) infection and inflammation of the liver. Most infants who are infected at birth and 25% to 50% of infected children aged 1-5 years have a chronic persistent infection. Chronic infection may be mild or may damage the liver. The majority of individuals with chronic hepatitis B who clear the virus and are \"cured\" still have detectable virus in the liver. However, the importance of this fact is unclear since there is no evidence of consequences to the presence of the virus except that it can be reactivated with immunosuppression. Individuals with hepatitis B virus only in the liver are not infectious. Some people with chronic hepatitis B infection have their lives shortened by complications of [liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm), [cirrhosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm), or [liver cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm). Who is at risk of catching hepatitis B? Hepatitis B vaccines are effective and safe. Most vaccinated individuals develop protective antibodies when they get the vaccine and are protected from infection with hepatitis B. Individuals at high risk for infection with hepatitis B include: - health care workers, - dentists, - intimate and household contacts of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, - public safety workers who may be exposed to blood products, - men who have sex with men, - individuals with multiple sexual partners, [dialysis](https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm)patients, - injection drug users, - persons with chronic liver disease, - residents and staff in institutions that care for persons with developmental disabilities, - persons infected with [human immunodeficiency virus](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm)( [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm)), and - persons who require repeated transfusions or blood products. Centers that serve high-risk individuals are encouraged to provide the vaccine to their clients. Such centers include: - dialysis units, - drug treatment facilities, [sexually transmitted diseases](https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)clinics and correctional facilities. What are examples of the hepatitis B vaccine? Vaccination has reduced the number of new cases of hepatitis B by more than 75% in the United States. The hepatitis B vaccine contains a protein (antigen) that stimulates the body to make protective antibodies. Examples of hepatitis B vaccines available in the United States include hepatitis B vaccine-injection ( [Engerix-B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b_vaccine-injection/article.htm) and Recombivax-HB). Three doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 months) are necessary to assure protection. There are also combination vaccines on the market that protect against hepatitis B and other diseases. For example: - hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a-vaccine injection (Twinrix), which protects both hepatitis A and hepatitis B; [Haemophilus B/hepatitis B vaccine - injection](https://www.medicinenet.com/haemophilus_bhepatitis_b_vaccine-injection/article.htm)( [Comvax](https://www.medicinenet.com/haemophilus_bhepatitis_b_vaccine-injection/article.htm)) provides protection against hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a cause of [meningitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/meningitis/article.htm)); and - Pediarix protects against hepatitis B, [tetanus](https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm), [pertussis](https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm), and [polio](https://www.medicinenet.com/polio_facts/article.htm). What are the cons of hepatitis B vaccine? A blood test for hepatitis B antibodies is recommended after vaccination to ensure that antibodies have been produced. For the few who do not form antibodies, revaccination may improve the response, especially in infants. However, a small proportion of individuals will never respond to hepatitis B vaccination. Side effects from the vaccine usually are mild, primarily soreness at the site of injection. The risk of serious allergic reactions ( [anaphylaxis](https://www.medicinenet.com/anaphylaxis/article.htm)) is less than one per million doses. Who should get hepatitis B vaccine? In the United States, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants at birth. Older children and adolescents should receive the vaccine if they did not receive it at birth. Adults in high-risk situations also are advised to receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Some countries have a high prevalence of hepatitis B in their population. [Travelers](https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_health/article.htm) who visit these countries for a prolonged period (usually 6 months or longer) and those who may be exposed to blood or semen should consider vaccination. Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to a known case of hepatitis B or a person at high risk for hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician. Examples of such exposures include needle stick injuries in health care workers or sexual intercourse with an infected person. If the exposure is significant, the physician will recommend vaccination and may also recommend an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is prepared from the plasma of blood donors and contains antibodies to hepatitis B. Vaccination and HBIG can substantially reduce the risk of disease in persons exposed to hepatitis B if given within one week of a needle stick or two weeks of sexual intercourse. Can you lose immunity to hep B? Vaccination provides long-term immunity in people who respond to the vaccine. There is no need for HBIG if exposure occurs to a vaccinated person who is known to have responded to the vaccine; however, a blood test might be drawn to verify that the person did respond to the vaccine and form antibodies. Infected mothers can pass hepatitis B to their [newborn](https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm) infants. All [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) women should have blood drawn to determine if they are infected. Infants born to infected mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccines at birth. This is 85% to 95% effective in eliminating the risk of hepatitis B infection in the infant.

Normal bilirubin levels vary from lab to lab, and range from around 0.2 to 1.2 mg/dL. High levels of bilirubin can be diagnosed with a bilirubin blood test. Causes of elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood can be caused by infections, viral hepatitis, anemia, genetic diseases, and liver problems. Symptoms of elevated bilirubin levels depend on the cause; however, jaundice is a common sign. Treatment for elevated bilirubin levels depend on the cause. Childhood Vaccination ScheduleChildhood immunizations can protect children from potentially deadly diseases. Vaccinations included on the childhood immunization schedule include Hib, polio, DTaP, MMR, HPV, flu, chickenpox, meningitis, rotavirus, pneumonia, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. Cirrhosis (Liver)Cirrhosis of the liver refers to a disease in which normal liver cells are replaced by scar tissue caused by alcohol and viral hepatitis B and C. This disease leads to abnormalities in the liver's ability to handle toxins and blood flow, causing internal bleeding, kidney failure, mental confusion, coma, body fluid accumulation, and frequent infections. Symptoms include yellowing of the skin (jaundice), itching, and fatigue. The prognosis is good for some people with cirrhosis of the liver, and the survival can be up to 12 years; however the life expectancy is about 6 months to 2 years for people with severe cirrhosis with major complications. Hepatitis B PictureInflammation of the liver due to the hepatitis B virus (HBV), once thought to be passed only through blood products. See a picture of Hepatitis B and learn more about the health topic. Hepatitis C, Hep B, Hep A: Symptoms, Causes, TreatmentHepatitis C, B, and A are viruses that cause liver inflammation. Hepatitis B vaccines and hepatitis A vaccines are available. Hepatitis symptoms may not appear for weeks to months after infection. Hepatitis A transmission occurs most often via contaminated food. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission require contact with infected bodily fluids or blood. What Is Viral Hepatitis? How You Catch Hepatitis A, B, and CHepatitis C virus and hepatitis B can make an infected person very sick and they are risk factors for liver cancer, liver disease, liver failure, and liver damage. Prior to 1992, blood transfusion was a risk for contracting hepatitis C infection. Hepatitis B and C are blood-borne infections, while hepatitis A is easier to catch, but less serious. How Does a Person Get Hepatitis?There are various types of hepatitis, which a person can get by food or water contaminated with the fecal matter of an infected person, sexual contact, blood transfusion, sharing needles, direct contact with an infected person's blood or body fluid, transfer from mother to the fetus, tattoo needles, or needle prick. Vaccination Schedule for Adults and AdolescentsImmunizations can prevent many diseases nowadays. It's important to follow the vaccination guidelines recommended on the CDC's vaccination schedule for adults and adolescents in order to stay informed about new vaccines and to learn how often and when the vaccines should be administered. Jaundice in Adults (Hyperbilirubinemia)Jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia in adults is caused by an underlying disease or condition. Learn about when to worry about jaundice in adults, symptoms, treatment, causes, diagnosis, and prevention. Liver Blood TestsAn initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the presence of certain liver enzymes in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream, and can lead to diseases like fatty liver, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hepatitis. Several medications also can increase liver enzyme test results. Liver DiseaseLiver disease can be cause by a variety of things including infection (hepatitis), diseases, for example, gallstones, high cholesterol or triglycerides, blood flow obstruction to the liver, and toxins (medications and chemicals). Symptoms of liver disease depends upon the cause and may include nausea, vomiting, upper right abdominal pain, and jaundice. Treatment depends upon the cause of the liver disease.
