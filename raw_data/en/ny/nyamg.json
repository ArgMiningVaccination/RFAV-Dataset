Meanwhile, infections surged past 330 million to a world wide figure of 330,828,618. A fourth shot of Covid vaccine raises antibodies to even higher levels than the third jab but it is not enough to prevent Omicron infections, according to a preliminary study in [Israel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-17/israel-trial-suggests-4th-dose-not-warding-off-omicron-infection). Moderna is aiming to launch a single booster vaccination that will protect against both Covid-19 and flu within two years, its chief executive said, adding that data for Omicron-specific jab will likely be available in March. The chief executive of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, has said that while the coronavirus will continue to circulate for many years to come, this current wave should be the last to have to lead to restrictions. The International Labor Organization downgraded its employment forecast, projecting a world shortfall of 52 million full-time jobs in 2022 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Uncertainty created by Covid-19 variants continues to weigh on the jobs market - particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries, the Geneva-based organization said Monday.

White House chief medical adviser Anthony [Fauci](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/covid-pandemic-omicron-dr-fauci-b1995086.html) said it's too soon to say whether the Omicron variant will herald a shift in the Covid-19 pandemic to endemic. \"It's an open question as to whether or not omicron is going to be the live virus vaccination everyone is hoping for because we have so much variability with new variants emerging,\" Fauci said Monday at the World Economic Forum's Davos Agenda online conference. The fact that the virus's mutations appear to be able to evade some immune response through vaccines and infection will make achieving herd immunity difficult, he said. Travellers to Hawaii may soon need to have supplemented their vaccinations with a booster does in order to visit the islands without having to quarantine. Canada: New rules requiring truckers to show proof of vaccination when crossing the Canada-US border are cutting into shipping capacity and boosting the cost of hauling everything from broccoli to tomatoes.
