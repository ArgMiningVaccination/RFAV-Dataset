In reality, most people who apply for a partial or full vaccine exemption have one or more college degrees, and have an upper middle class income. It is NOT fun, to sift through pages and pages of books, journals, and articles all the while flip-\u00adflopping inside your own brain about doing what is best for your family. Reading horror stories on both sides of the decision, and realizing that there is a chance you and your child could be one of those people. You could be the person who didn't vaccinate and experienced debilitating illness, or you could be the person who DID vaccinate and experienced debilitating illness. There are ways to avoid (a few or all) vaccines, and there are ways to fully vaccinate according to the CDC schedule in a SAFER manner. Healthcare is not one-\u00adsize-\u00adfits all. No other medical treatment is used across the board on every individual without testing, screening, and examination. Some vaccines may be right for your family, some may not. You might pick all, none, few, or most vaccines, but you should be supported the entire way. Making the decision to vaccinate or not: It doesn't have to be all or nothing (There are adjusted schedules, & everyone's situation is different.) You get to choose because you are the parent (no friend, grandparent, sister, brother, or doctor can choose for you) It should involve tough questions and honest answers It should not be full of peer pressure, judgment, hate, ridicule, or persuasion It should be full of good intentions, support, and accurate information There are more factors affecting your child's immunity than vaccines alone. Immunization and vaccination are not interchangeable terms. Food (breast-\u00adfed, formula, processed foods, organic foods, plants vs. fast food) o Food is a HUGE factor; Disease and vaccine injuries alike are much more likely to occur if your child is not getting the nutrients they need Environmental toxins (soaps, detergents, farm chemicals, toxic cleaning products) Genetics Lifestyle (activity level, etc.) Before you vaccinate, ask yourself: Am I, or my child sick right now? Have I, my child, or anyone in our immediate family had adverse reactions to vaccines? DO I know the disease and vaccine risks for myself and my child? Do I have the full information about the vaccine's side effects? Do I know how to IDENTIFY and REPORT a vaccine reaction? Do I know I need to keep a written record, including the vaccine manufacturer's name and lot number for all vaccinations? Do I know that I have the right to make an informed choice? It's ok to ask your pediatrician for the vaccine package inserts for every vaccine before you make a decision. It's ok to ask your doctor if they have read the package inserts. If they read it, they would know that it says: \"The health-\u00adcare provider should provide the vaccine information required to be given with each vaccination to the patient, parent, or guardian. The health-\u00adcare provider should inform the patient, parent, or guardian of the benefits and risks associated with vaccination. Patients, parents, or guardians should be instructed to report any serious adverse reactions to their health-\u00adcare provider who in turn should report such events to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 1-\u00ad800-\u00ad822-\u00ad7967.{49}\" Doctors used to smoke. Doctor's used to advertise for cigarettes. They also used to recommend cocaine for toothaches. Doctors are a resource of information for you. They can only tell you what they have learned, and it is possible for scientific information to change. Physicians cannot be sole reason you make any decision. \u00a9 Dr. Hannah Anderson, DC \u009f Back In Line Family Chiropractic and Wellness, P.C. \u009f Hiawatha, IA Vaccine Detoxifcation You may want the protective efforts of vaccines, but there's a good chance you DON'T want the toxins that come with them. Formaldehyde, mercury, aluminum, bromide, MSG, 2-phenoxyethoanol, polysorbate 80, and more! These nasty things are among the most toxic known to man, and can be retained in the kidneys, spleen, liver, heart, brain, lymph nodes, and muscle if our body isn't metabolizing them or detoxing properly. The more you can metabolize and get rid of toxins, the less likely you or your child will be to suffer the unfortunate adverse effects from vaccinations. This is our attempt at getting the best of both worlds (medical and natural), and supporting your child in every situation as much as we possibly can! Pre-Vaccine Support 1. Make sure the GI tract is healthy! a. Your child should be having healthy, regular bowel movements daily at least 14 days prior to any vaccine. If this is not the case, discuss your treatment options with a physician, or the Back In Line team. 2. Nutrition - We suggest the following supplements daily, 2 weeks before vaccinating, ask a physician for doses. Each of the following supplements can be purchased at Back In Line, if we don't have any in stock we will order some especially for you! a. Probiotics (good bacteria put into the gut, which helps to make your immune system stronger! 70-80% of our immune systems reside in these little gut bugs!). We recommend physician grade probiotics, such as Orthomolecular's Floraboost, which is powdered and easy for kids to take. b. Omega 3's - essential for brain function and detoxification; especially with MMR, DTaP, and Varicella vaccines (most prone to adverse effects). We recommend physician grade Orthomega Pearls for kids. c. Vitamin A - Research has shown that Vitamin A supplementation is effective at preventing and treating measles infections, as well as many other diseases. We suggest Vita-Kids Immune, a physician grade liquid that also has elderberry herbs in it which stimulates the immune system and helpful filter cells. d. Vitamin D - Vitamin D is the immune system KING/QUEEN. We have a tasteless, colorless, physician grade liquid form from Orthomolecular labs that can be used for the whole family. 3. Get Adjusted! - Chiropractic adjustments boost the immune system, making sure the brain is able to talk to the rest of the body via the spinal cord. A higher functioning immune system prior to vaccinating will help the body better deal with infections and toxins. Visit your family chiropractor, or visit us here at Back In Line. Dr. Anderson is trained in pediatric-specific adjusting that uses very light touch to help our kiddos function at 100%! Affordable family packages are available for mom, dad, and siblings to all get their immune boost. 4. Avoid processed food and junk food the week before vaccinations. The goal is to decrease the toxic blow as much as possible. If your child is breastfeeding, awesome -- Keep it going! Post-Vaccination Detox 1. Continue nutritional supplements (listed above) 2 weeks after vaccinating to keep the immune system strong. 2. Get Adjusted! A vaccine contains toxins that can throw our nervous systems out of whack. Get back to proper function by getting checked by Dr. Anderson, or your family chiropractor the week following vaccination. 3. IR Sauna - come sit in our infrared sauna at Back In Line. Mom, dad, and siblings, can sit in the sauna with vaccinated children or babies for no extra charge. We have protocols specifically for our precious pediatric patients. Sweating eliminates toxins and heavy metals. 4. Continue to avoid processed foods - (and junk foods), for as long as possible after vaccinating! 5. Water - If the child is an appropriate age for drinking water, make sure they are drinking enough. We detox heavily through our bowels, and we need to keep them moving! Possible Detoxification Side Effects Occasionally when your body is getting rid of garbage, you might feel a little garbage-y. It may not happen, but if it does, it may be normal. You might notice you or your children feeling nauseous, sleepy, grumpy, sweaty, or having loose stools. These are signs your body is doing its best to get the toxins out. Sometimes this is called a \"healing crisis\". More commonly than not, this will not occur, but if it does, feel free to call our office "}
