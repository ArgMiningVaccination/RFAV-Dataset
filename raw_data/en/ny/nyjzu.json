The initial exclusion of pregnant women from anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines clinical trials has caused a lack of conclusive data about safety and efficacy for this vulnerable population. This cross-sectional study aims to define the factors related to vaccination adherence in a sample of women experiencing high-risk pregnancies. The recruited women completed a questionnaire based on the Health Belief Model. Data were analyzed to evaluate the associations between socio-demographic variables and vaccination acceptance through descriptive, univariate and multivariate logistic analyses. Among the 233 women enrolled, 65.2% (n = 152) declared that they would accept the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Multivariate analysis showed that vaccination acceptance was associated with a high educational level (aOR = 4.52, p = 0.001), a low perception of barriers to vaccination (aOR = 1.58, p = 0.005) and the gynecologist's advice (aOR = 3.18, p = 0.01). About a third of pregnant women are still hesitant about the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, probably because of the conflicting information received from media, friends, acquaintances and health institutions.

Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00454)]. The emergence of four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) at the end of 2020 has raised apprehensions about a possible reduced performance of currently available vaccines. Following the World Health Organization (WHO)'s lead, these variants are referred to as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. Omicron, the currently widespread dominant variant, was first detected in November 2021 [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00454)]. The literature suggests that Omicron has an increased transmissibility compared to the Delta variant and that current vaccines are less effective against Omicron infection, but they still protect against hospitalization and severe disease. Severity of COVID-19 is associated with increased age and pre-existing or underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00454), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00454)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00454), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00454), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00454)]. A multinational observational study conducted in 18 countries showed that pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 had a greater risk of admission to the ICU or high-dependency unit (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10) and were 22 times more likely to die (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172) [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00454)]. Furthermore, a review showed that pregnant women with COVID-19 are exposed to a higher risk of adverse fetal consequences, such as preterm delivery (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14-1.91), stillbirth CI to the neonatal ICU (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.87-12.81) compared with pregnant uninfected women [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00454)], while asymptomatic women had rates that were similar to the uninfected [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00454)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00454)]. Furthermore, the exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from preauthorization clinical trials contributed to uncertainty about the immunogenicity and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in these cohorts [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00454)]. Because of this lack of evidence, at the beginning of January 2021, the WHO stated that vaccination should be made available to \"pregnant women who are in those groups at high risk of exposure (healthcare workers (HCWs) or women with comorbidities), after a discussion of the risks and benefits of vaccination with their health care provider\" [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00454)]. A few days after this, the Italian Obstetric Surveillance System (ItOSS) and the Italian Institute of Health (ISS) published their first interim guidelines following the WHO recommendations [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00454)]. Consequently, HCWs had to assess the balance between potential risk and benefits on an individual basis, and advocated for vaccination only for breastfeeding and pregnant women at high risk of exposure to the virus, such as women who work in the healthcare front line or those who have comorbidities. Afterwards, on 22 September 2021, the ISS updated its guidelines and established that pregnant and lactating women are eligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, since studies have shown that their safety profiles are similar to non-pregnant and non-lactating individuals. On 13 December 2021, the ISS further updated the indications and recommended that the booster dose be offered to pregnant women who are in the second and third trimester and desire to be vaccinated [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00454), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00454)]. On 7 October 2022, the Italian Health Ministry announced the approval of the fourth anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose for pregnant women [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00454)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00454), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00454), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00454)]. It was only in February 2021 that the first phase of a 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind vaccine trial including healthy pregnant women (Pfizer-BioNTech, [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov)identifier: NCT04754594) was begun. Later, evidence emerged supporting the safety and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00454)], leading to increasing support for vaccination of pregnant and lactating women. A large observational cohort study of pregnant women highlighted that the estimated vaccine effectiveness 7-56 days after the second dose was 96% for any documented infection, 97% for symptomatic infection and 89% for COVID-19-related hospitalization [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00454)]. Preliminary findings from three U.S. vaccine safety monitoring systems have so far not shown any safety signals among pregnant women who received anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00454)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00454), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00454), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00454), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00454)]. Current studies show that the pregnancy trimester does not affect SARS-CoV-2 antibody production [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00454)]. 2. Materials and Methods [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00454)], and it was validated in a convenience sample of pregnant women. [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00454)]. The HBM theorizes that individuals are more willing to adopt behaviors in order to prevent diseases (such as vaccination) if they perceive that they are at increased risk to get a disease (perceived susceptibility), the disease and its consequences are harmful (perceived severity), the barriers to overcome in order to perform the behavior are minimal (perceived barriers) and the behavior is effective in reducing the risk of getting a disease (perceived benefits) [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00454)]. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00454-t001)describes the socio-demographic characteristics and health statuses of enrolled women. The mean age of the respondents was 32 years (SD \u00b1 5.72). Pregnant women were more frequently Italian (97.5%; n = 227), currently living in the city of Palermo (59.6%; n = 139) and were at their first pregnancy (40.7%; n = 95). Concerning educational status, only a small proportion of respondents (21.4%, n = 50) had a college educational background or above, while two thirds of the participants (65.2%, n = 153) were unemployed (housewives and students). Regarding health status, enrolled women more frequently had more than one parity (59.3%; n = 138) and no chronic disease (70.8%; n = 165). [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00454-t002)shows the answers related to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and the HBM assumptions. Less than half of the enrolled women (46.8%, n = 109) had already received the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The source of information on vaccination most frequently reported was the mass media (36%, n = 84), followed by a gynecologist (30.4%, n=71) and a GP (22.3%, n = 52). Among the people who accepted the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, their gynecologist was more frequently the source of information (38.1% vs. 16.1%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, regarding the susceptibility items of the HBM, pregnant women who accepted the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were more concerned about getting COVID-19 (strongly agree: 50% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.01). Similarly, those who accepted anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were more concerned about the risk for their unborn babies to be infected by COVID-19 (strongly agree: 54% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.01). In the barriers dimension of the HBM, pregnant women who accepted vaccination were more likely to believe that the vaccination is safe during pregnancy and effective against SARS-CoV-2 (safety: strongly agree 28.3% vs. 7.4%, p < 0.01, effectiveness: strongly agree 36.8% vs. 3.7%, p < 0.01). In the benefits dimension, those who accepted the vaccination were more likely to strongly agree with the benefit of vaccination for themselves (41.4% vs. 6.2%, p < 0.01) and their fetuses (39.5% vs 6.2%, p < 0.01) than those who did not accept vaccination. [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00454-t003)) showed that having a bachelor's degree or above (cOR 4.74; 95% CI 1.58-5.6), being at a first pregnancy (cOR 0.48; 95% CI 0.27-0.85), not reporting any pre-existing chronic disease (cOR 1.85; 95% CI 1.02-3.35) and having a gynecologist as a source of information (cOR 3.18, 95% CI 1.28-7.92) were statistically significant factors in association with vaccination acceptance. [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00454-t003)), after adjusting for confounding variables, demonstrated that having a high school diploma (aOR 4.52; 95% CI 95% CI 1.57-4.14), and a low level of perceived barriers to vaccination (aOR 0.63; 95% CI 0.45-0.86) were independently associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance. 4. Discussion [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00454)]. Although evidence about safety and efficacy became clearer and the vaccination was openly endorsed by scientific societies, there is still not a full acceptance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by pregnant women. The literature showed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy was even more common during pregnancy, and that the main reason for vaccination refusal among pregnant women was the fear of potential consequences for their fetus or themselves [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00454)]. The vaccine hesitancy was related not only to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00454)], but also to seasonal influenza and pertussis vaccines, two long-lasting recommended maternal vaccinations [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00454)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00454)]. A scoping review about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy determinants in high-income countries has identified a lower educational level as a demographic characteristic that is strongly related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00454)]. This may be explained in different ways. First, a highly educated woman is likely to have better health knowledge, so she is more prone to perform healthy behaviors and make healthier lifestyle choices [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00454)]. Second, a high educational level is often associated with a better economic status and, as a consequence, with greater access to quality healthcare and a high communication level with HCWs [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00454)]. Third, a well-educated woman has greater access to different information sources, so she is less likely to be biased by inaccurate information about vaccines spreading on the Internet, leading to fewer probable potential misunderstandings about the safety of vaccines [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00454)]. [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00454)]. The gynecologist indeed has far more opportunities during prenatal care than the GP to advise pregnant women on whether to vaccinate. The gynecologist is the healthcare provider whom women trust the most, and is able to counter widespread misinformation about the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In our study, about half of the participants received information from health care providers (GP, gynecologist, other HCWs), while the remaining ones personally acquired their knowledge from journals, television, and web consultations. Those findings are different from a previous study about maternal vaccinations, in which HCWs were reported as a source of information by three quarters of surveyed women [ [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00454)]. This finding raises concerns about the role that media have been playing in spreading information about the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as it has been proven that misinformation, both online and offline, lowers anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine confidence [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00454)], and erroneous messages from one's network of trust (e.g., friends and family) can create a barrier to vaccination [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00454)]. Furthermore, the decline of HCWs as the main source of information also highlights that mistrust in the healthcare system and health institutions has been increasing in Italy since the beginning of the pandemic [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00454)]. [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00454), [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00454)]. The present survey refers to \"barriers\" to the vaccination in pregnancy as those related to vaccine safety and the belief that the vaccine is not beneficial. Women who reject immunization, indeed, fear a potential threat to themselves or their fetus, since they are worried about the safety of vaccines, and believe that the benefits are darkened by the perceived negative maternal and fetal effects of vaccines [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00454)]. To counteract this effect, communication strategies around the safety and effectiveness of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in pregnancy should be implemented by HCWs that pregnant women trust, especially gynecologists. [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00454)]. A systematic review has highlighted a significant increase in vaccination uptake after interventions in pregnant women [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00454)]. For example, a study offering onsite vaccination to pregnant women during antenatal visits in order to increase uptake showed a positive association between onsite availability of pertussis vaccine and maternal pertussis receipt during pregnancy [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00454)]. Therefore, since the establishment of a trust-based relationship between a pregnant woman and her gynecologist is necessary for maternal immunization decision-making, these professionals have the responsibility of counseling pregnant women during antenatal visits in order to increase vaccination uptake and improve maternal and neonatal health. 5.
