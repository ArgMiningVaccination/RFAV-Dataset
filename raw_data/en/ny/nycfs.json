For some people, a Hepatitis B or [Hepatitis C infection](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c) goes away on its own, but in other cases, it can cause serious liver damage, leading to chronic liver disease. Acupuncture and TCM treatment, including Chinese herbs, offer a way to [help improve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229916300759) liver function and reduce symptoms of Hepatitis. There are several variants of the Hepatitis virus that can cause inflammation of the liver, leading to scarring (liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis), and in some cases leading to chronic liver problems or liver cancer. Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hep C (HCV) are the types of infection that can lead to long-term illness and even liver failure. It is estimated that over [300 million people worldwide](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1) are living with the effects of HBV or HCV infections. There is a vaccination that offers protection against Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A, but there is no vaccine for Hepatitis types C, D, and E. People who have contracted Hepatitis A or an acute form of HBV are usually told to rest and drink lots of fluids. Medical treatment for chronic Hepatitis that lasts for more than six months usually involves antiviral medications that help slow down the spread of the virus through the body. [TCM treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22083981/) for Hepatitis with acupuncture and herbs works to [improve the function of the liver](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and related organs (spleen, kidneys, gallbladder) and to strengthen the immune system so that the body can overcome the effects of the Hepatitis virus. What Causes Hepatitis? There are currently five different types of Hepatitis infection, referred to as: Hepatitis A, [Hepatitis B virus (HBV)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802), Hepatitis C (HCV or Hep C), Hepatitis D, and Hepatitis E. All of these viral infections affect the liver, causing inflammation and possibly scarring, known as cirrhosis of the liver or fibrosis of the liver. Hepatitis A and E viruses are carried in contaminated water or food supplies. People might contract the Hep A or Hep E virus through eating something like raw shellfish that was in contaminated water, or eating food prepared by a worker who did not wash their hands properly. These variants of Hepatitis may cause an acute infection, but do not lead to chronic conditions. [HBV](https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/the-abcs-of-viral-hepatitis/) and HCV are spread through bodily fluids like blood and semen, and can therefore be spread through sexual contact, or the sharing of needles, or a woman may pass the infection to her baby during birth. Hepatitis is a common co-infection in [people living with HIV/AIDS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People with [Cystic Fibrosis (CF)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-cystic-fibrosis-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) can also be more prone to infections and liver problems. These more serious forms of Hepatitis can lead to chronic illness, including cancer of the liver, or liver failure, making it one of the primary reasons people end up having a liver transplant. Top 10 Symptoms of Hepatitis Symptoms of a HBV or Hepatitis C infection often do not show up for a few weeks, a few months, or in some cases, years later. Some people, especially children, do not feel any symptoms of Hepatitis. The most common Hepatitis symptoms include: - Abdominal pain, pain in right side - Swelling in liver area, swollen belly (ascites - fluid buildup in the liver) - Jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin - Dark urine, pee is dark - Light colored stools, poop is clay-colored - Fatigue - Nausea - Fever - Loss of appetite - Joint pain Bleeding easily or bruising easily are also potentially [signs of Hep C](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepatitis-c-skin-problems), as is a skin rash, or itchy skin (pruritus), little blisters, or itchy patches of skin like psoriasis. Some people have a sensation of their internal organs itching. What Is the Treatment for Hepatitis? If a person shows high levels of liver enzymes and still has the Hepatitis B virus in their body after six months or more, they will often be prescribed medications aimed to slow the spread of the virus and prevent further damage to the liver. There are several types of [antiviral medications](https://www.hepb.org/treatment-and-management/treatment/approved-drugs-for-adults/) used to treat patients with long-term effects of Hepatitis, some of them are pills (adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir) that are taken daily for a year, or for several years. Some, known as Interferons, are given as an injection a few times a week over the course of several months or more. These medications can slow the virus in some patients, but for some people, they may not do much to protect the body from liver damage or stop the virus from spreading. These medications can cause serious side effects, including headaches, dizziness, fever, and severe depression. Acupuncture and TCM methods offer an alternative or adjunct support to help promote better liver function and boost the body's defense against the Hepatitis virus. What Acupuncture and TCM Can Do for Hepatitis Hepatitis infection is closely associated with the liver, as it is the liver that shows the most obvious damage as a result of infection, often resulting in cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. But according to TCM philosophy, the other internal organs work in concert with the liver, helping it to do the job of cleaning the blood and supplying it to the rest of the body. Patients with chronic Hepatitis B infection will demonstrate symptoms that help the acupuncture practitioner recognize a particular syndrome pattern, allowing them to use acupuncture points and Chinese herbs to work on deficiencies in the liver and other organs. In [TCM theory, Hepatitis](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Chinese+Traditional+Medicine+for+Hepatitis+C) infection occurs due to pathogenic forces of toxic Heat and Dampness invading the body. The infection moves through different stages, and the TCM provider will tailor treatment with herbs, acupuncture, and moxibustion to the [stage of infection](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/7482593/) and specific pattern of symptoms. TCM differentiations of Hepatitis include: - Liver Qi stagnation - causes symptoms like nausea, poor appetite, distension of the belly or [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Spleen and/or Kidney Yang deficiency - associated with poor appetite, loose stools, sallow complexion, weakness, loss of muscle - Liver - Gallbladder Dampness and Heat - causes jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), fever, nausea - Liver - Kidney Yin Deficiency - indicated (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) - Blood stasis - accumulation of blood in the liver contributes to fibrosis or cirrhosis, also causes pain in the lower rib area, [menstrual problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [PMS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A person may be more susceptible to getting Hepatitis because of some underlying deficiencies in their Qi, and/or the virus may cause those deficiencies to manifest. The main goal of acupuncture treatment for HBV or HCV, therefore, is to strengthen the liver, spleen, and kidneys, to clear any dampness or excess heat from these organs, and to increase the circulation of blood through the systems. Traditional Chinese herb formulations have been shown in [clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229916300759) to help improve liver function in patients with chronic Hepatitis B. [Herbs that help](https://www.asiabiotech.com/01/0105/0124_0124.pdf) improve spleen function are believed to help rid the body of the virus and allow for healing of the liver. Diet and nutrition are, naturally, also very important in helping to strengthen and detoxify the liver and other organs. Your TCM practitioner will go far beyond the usual advice (drink fluids, avoid alcohol), and will give you specific advice for a [hepatitis diet](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+and+Diet+for+Hepatitis+B) plan. Acupuncture Near Me for Hepatitis in West LA Chronic Hepatitis B and Hep C infections can be difficult to treat. Using acupuncture and herbs as an adjunct to conventional antiviral therapy for HBV may help to prevent further damage to the liver and improve organ function so that patients can recover from a chronic viral infection more fully. At Art of Wellness, we have over 30 years of experience providing integrative care for those suffering from chronic illnesses of all kinds. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Why is PMS so bad? [Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20376780) is a set of symptoms that occur in the days before a woman gets her period. PMS symptoms affect every woman differently, and can be serious enough to disrupt your life every month. TCM is an effective way to deal with PMS, because [acupuncture treatment can help](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005290.pub2/full) relieve both physical and emotional symptoms of PMS and severe PMS, also known as [PMDD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd) (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). To say that PMS is common among women is an understatement. The vast majority of women experience some changes in both their mental health and their bodies the week before their period starts. Whether or not a woman feels that it has a negative impact on her daily life may change over time. For some women, PMS isn't a big deal; for others, it's a major problem that can affect their relationships, impact their work, and make life hell every month. Most women find their own particular pattern of PMS is somewhat predictable-until it isn't. One of the most frustrating aspects of menstrual problems is the sense that things change without warning, and symptoms can come on suddenly with ferocious intensity. It can be difficult to describe how you feel before your period, because the symptoms seem to come and go. Some women find that their PMS symptoms are different from month to month. In some cases, they might find that every other month is bad, while the alternating months aren't so bad. Why is PMS worse some months? Other than the basic understanding that PMS is caused by fluctuations in hormones and brain chemistry, conventional medical science does not offer much in the way of clear answers about what causes PMS. TCM provides a different framework for looking at menstrual problems and has been used to treat women's health issues of all kinds for many centuries. [TCM treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513602/) including acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion, and Chinese herbs can not only help relieve PMS symptoms, they can also be beneficial for other menstrual problems like [irregular periods, PCOS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [painful periods, endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [heavy periods, fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and symptoms of [perimenopause](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Top 10 Symptoms of PMS As a syndrome, [PMS](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/premenstrual-syndrome) is considered a collection of symptoms that often appear together, in various combinations in different individuals. In the case of PMS, a woman may feel that her own symptoms change as often as every month, or gradually over the course of years. Girls in their teenage years may experience PMS in one way. Then, a woman in her early adult years may develop a different set of symptoms. After having a baby, a woman may find that her PMS symptoms have changed again. Then, many women in middle age experience changes in PMS symptoms as they go through perimenopause, approaching menopause. The most common signs of premenstrual syndrome include: - Mood swings, low mood, feelings of sadness or anger - Anxiety, feeling tense and irritable, cry easily or lose temper, want to be left alone - Trouble sleeping, insomnia, disturbed sleep - Breast tenderness, sore breasts, swollen breasts - Food cravings, changes in appetite - Weight gain, stomach bloating, water retention, pelvic pressure - Gassiness, changes in digestion and elimination [Acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), skin problems - Changes in libido - Headaches, migraines, difficulty concentrating, foggy head Less obvious or well-known symptoms of PMS include: [vision problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [tingling in the arms or legs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), lack coordination (clumsiness, dropping things), bruising easily, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and increased [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Other health problems can be amplified during the premenstrual [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and anxiety disorders. The physical and emotional aspects of PMS can affect each other, causing the typical mood swings. Feelings of sadness and frustration, or lack of sleep, may lead to comfort eating, but then the sight and sensation of your bloated stomach can cause you to feel depressed about your body. Minor problems with your spouse or co-workers can suddenly seem overwhelming and make you feel angry or helpless. For some women, PMS symptoms are so bad that they feel unable to function the week before their period. Severe PMS is now diagnosed as [PMDD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/expert-answers/pmdd/faq-20058315). What Is PMDD? PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) is a severe form of PMS marked by intense emotional symptoms that dramatically impact a woman's life, in addition to physical symptoms. \"Dysphoria\" is the opposite of \"euphoria;\" in other words, it is a mental state characterized by profound unhappiness and negative feelings. It is estimated that about 5% of all women experience this extreme type of PMS. Signs of PMDD include: [Severe anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), paranoia - Severe depression, in some cases even suicidal thoughts, lack of self-worth - Anger and irritability that provokes rage and causes conflicts with other people - Fatigue, low energy, [inability to concentrate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), feelings of confusion - Intense food cravings, possibly leading to binge eating Again, there is currently no scientific answer for what causes [PMDD](https://iapmd.org/about-pmdd), although it is generally believed to be related to the way estrogen levels and progesterone levels change between ovulation and the onset of the menstrual period. Mood is considered to be related to serotonin levels in the brain, and this is why [PMDD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd) is usually treated with birth control pills, which suppress ovulation, and/or antidepressants (SSRIs), which affect serotonin uptake. Medical Treatment for PMS Naturally, when a woman asks for advice about PMS or PMDD, she is going to hear suggestions like: \"try meditating, exercise more, eat a healthy diet, and get more sleep.\" And it is true that making good lifestyle choices is an important part of helping to reduce PMS symptoms. But women who are suffering with serious PMS need solutions beyond these kinds of lifestyle guidelines. When women complain of PMS symptoms, [doctors](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376787) will most often recommend OTC pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (NSAIDs) to relieve pain. Diuretics may be used to relieve bloating or premenstrual weight gain. Of course, most commonly, women are prescribed oral birth control pills, which suppress ovulation, and therefore may reduce the severity of PMS symptoms. More and more frequently, women may be prescribed antidepressants to try to deal with emotional symptoms and mood swings, or anxiety medications to take as needed during PMS. In effect, doctors often treat PMS the same way they would depression or anxiety. Clearly, birth control pills are not helpful for women who may want to get pregnant, and some women may be concerned about how taking the pill or antidepressants may affect their fertility in the future. None of these pharmacological solutions for PMS address the root cause of the symptoms, and all of these medications carry side effects that may impact a woman's overall health. Health care for women with [TCM seeks to address](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2015/01/25/the-pms-relief-you've-been-looking-for-traditional-chinese-herbs-and-acupuncture) the deeper internal causes of hormonal imbalances and other problems with the organ systems that are impacting the health of the ovaries and the regularity of the menstrual cycle. Can Acupuncture Help PMS? While it is only in recent years that conventional medicine has begun to acknowledge connections between physical health and emotional health, TCM has understood for many hundreds of years that health conditions of all kinds, especially those related to the menstrual cycle, are rooted in the balance of energies. Menstruation represents an ongoing process of transformation that occurs not only within the reproductive organs, but which affects every part of a woman, and even the people around her. The concept of Yin and Yang in Chinese philosophy describes two opposing yet complementary forces that are constantly acting upon each other in order to achieve balance. The menstrual cycle is very much based on Yin and Yang energies; during the follicular phase of the cycle (before ovulation), Yin is increasing while Yang is decreasing, and in the luteal phase (after ovulation, before the period), Yang is increasing while Yin is decreasing. The system is designed, naturally, to create the right conditions for conception; this process of Yin and Yang exchange is what determines a [woman's fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). While the health of the uterus and ovaries is definitely central to the process, within the TCM philosophy, they are not the only organs involved with menstruation. The Kidneys, Liver, and Heart all have important roles to play, as well. In TCM, we also view the elements of Fire-to provide warmth, controlled by the Heart-and Water, controlled by the Kidneys-to provide moisture, as being vital to all processes within the body, especially to menstruation. Blood is cleansed, stored, and then distributed to the other organs by the Liver. Blood being central to the process of menstruation, the Liver's role is really key in how the whole thing plays out. According to TCM theory, most PMS and PMDD symptoms are caused by problems with Liver Qi. When the Liver Qi is out of balance, it can lead to feelings of anger, frustration, depression, and irritability. The Liver system is particularly susceptible to negative [effects of stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). There are a few [different variations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494079/) of Liver Qi imbalance and other patterns that can contribute to PMS symptoms: - Liver Qi invasion - This is a condition of excess, in which there is too much rising Liver Qi, characterized by overall negative emotions that are disruptive, including anger and anxiety, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, and constipation. - Liver Qi depression - In this case, there is not enough Liver Qi, causing feelings of sadness, heaviness in chest, painful swelling of breasts, sighing, bloated stomach, lack of appetite, cramping during period, scanty blood during period. - Spleen Kidney deficiency - In this case, stagnant energy in the Kidney system is preventing water from moving appropriately, causing water retention or edema. From the scientific medical standpoint, acupuncture treatment has been shown to have a positive effect on neurotransmitters like serotonin, and to impact levels of estrogen and progesterone. This happens naturally because we are using TCM methods to restore optimal function of all the organs. With Chinese herbs we are able to get specific nutrients into the body that we cannot get from the foods we normally eat. Acupuncture treatment accompanied with [specific herbs for PMS](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006414.pub2/abstract) patterns can help balance the liver Qi, and bring all of the organs into synergistic harmony. In order to make lasting change, it is best to have acupuncture treatment at least once or twice a week. We need to deal with [each phase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614973/) of the menstrual cycle as it occurs by tailoring the acupuncture treatment and herbs to your PMS and period symptoms. A [systematic review](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.02994.x) of ten controlled trials using acupuncture to treat PMS concluded that TCM treatment of PMS significantly improved symptoms. Top 3 Tips for PMS Relief From TCM Perspective There are still a lot of taboos surrounding women's health, and many girls and women have never learned how to take care of their reproductive health. Working with an experienced TCM doctor will enable you to get personalized care and advice about how to eat the best diet for PMS symptoms, what activities to avoid before your period, and other female hygiene tips that you may not have heard before. - Nutrition - conventional Western thinking about healthy eating currently focuses on eating fresh, whole foods, which is good, except that people tend to think this means eating a lot of foods raw or cold, as in salads and smoothies. According to the TCM philosophy of nutrition, though, eating cold foods is actually one of the worst things you can do when it comes to relieving PMS and painful periods. Putting a lot of cold food into the stomach cools down the temperature of the other internal organs, which can contribute to more cramping and worse cramps. During the week before your period, concentrate on eating plenty of nourishing, cooked foods like soups and stews, proteins and vegetables, and whole grains like brown rice and quinoa. Avoid too much dairy, sugar, caffeine, hot, spicy or fried foods (that includes chips and crackers), and definitely avoid icy cold beverages and frozen treats. - Keep track of your period - there are many apps available now to help with this, but it can also be a simple chart with room for notes about your symptoms. Keeping track of your PMS symptoms every month can help you recognize patterns in your own behaviors and experiences. A record of PMS symptoms will also help you communicate what you're feeling to your health care providers when you are seeking treatment for PMS or PMDD. - Exercise - gentle movement modalities that move Qi through the body are great to help PMS: Tai Qi, yoga, or dancing are all good. Avoid deep twists that could squeeze or put pressure on the ovaries and other organs. Again, keep track of your exercise routines and how they affect your physical and emotional wellbeing from month to month so that you can see which type of workout is best for you, or if some types of exercise make PMS worse.

[ How to Treat Tennis Elbow With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tennis-elbow-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Pain in outer elbow or burning sensation in forearm? Tennis Elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, is a pain condition caused by overuse or repetitive movements of the arm and wrist. [Acupuncture and TCM can provide help](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1832-acupuncture-heals-tennis-elbow-stops-pain) with healing the muscles and tendons of the elbow and providing elbow pain relief of tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, or tendonitis, so you can get back to your usual activities. \"Tennis elbow\" gets its name from the fact that many people get this type of repetitive use injury from playing tennis and other sports that involve holding a racquet. But tennis elbow doesn't only occur in athletes; it's also common among people who have to perform repetitive movements that tax the muscles and tendons of the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand and involve gripping an object, such as: painting, hammering and sawing (construction workers), cutting or chopping (cooks, chefs, butchers), using a wrench (plumbers), or working on an assembly line. [Tennis elbow](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/tennis-elbow-lateral-epicondylitis/) is a kind of tendonitis, or inflammation of the soft tissues of the forearm. Tendonitis occurs when the soft tissues that attach muscles to bones sustain microtears and become inflamed. The major muscle involved in movements where the wrist and hand are gripping an object while the elbow is extending, or straightening, is the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle. The ECRB muscle experiences friction as it moves over the bumpy joining of three bones in the elbow joint. Over time, and with overuse, the tendons that attach the ECRB to the bones can become torn and/or inflamed. [Tennis elbow pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tennis-elbow/symptoms-causes/syc-20351987) is usually centered right in the outer side of the elbow, and just below the joint, but it can also radiate further down the arm and into the wrist. There might be a burning sensation in the muscle on the outer forearm. Pain and weakness in the elbow and wrist can make it difficult to perform regular actions like holding a cup or using a computer mouse. [Golfer's elbow](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/medial-epicondylitis-golfers-and-baseball-elbow) is a similar condition in that it is also an overuse injury that causes weakness and pain in the forearm. The difference is that with golfer's elbow, also known as medial epicondylitis, the inflammation and microtearing occur in the muscles and tendons involved in flexing the arm rather than extending it, or bending the wrist inward towards the palm with a lot of force or speed. These are located on the inner part of the elbow and forearm. This type of repetitive use condition can be the result of swinging a golf club, throwing a baseball, hitting a forceful spin serve in tennis, but also such activities as shovelling, using a heavy tool like an axe or chainsaw, or even just carrying a heavy suitcase with your hand and wrist wrapped around the handle. Tennis elbow pain can be resolved with rest, but for many people, complete rest is not a feasible or desirable option. Acupuncture treatment [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710923/) to help provide significant pain relief for tennis elbow. [Acupuncture treatment can help to reduce inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) and improve blood flow to injured areas to aid and speed healing of various types of tendonitis. Top 5 Symptoms of Tennis Elbow Signs of [tennis elbow](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/lateral-epicondylitis-tennis-elbow) usually develop slowly over time and are not caused by any obvious single injury. - Elbow pain or pain on the outside of the forearm, burning sensation in the outer part of elbow, stiff elbow - Pain that radiates down to the wrist, wrist pain, stiff wrist - Stiffness of the elbow, especially first thing in the morning - Weak grip strength, reduced grip strength - More severe pain when gripping an object, like a mug or racquet Symptoms of golfer's elbow are similar, except that the pain is located on the inner side of the elbow or forearm, as opposed to the outer side. Pain is more likely to radiate to the fourth and fifth fingers (ring finger and pinky finger) than to the wrist. You may feel pain when making a fist. Wrist pain, tingling in the fingers, and weak grip strength can also be signs of [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/). Medical Treatment for Tennis Elbow The standard treatment for Tennis Elbow begins with rest, icing, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs like Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen) to reduce pain and swelling. If the pain persists, or perhaps if a person is not able to avoid the activities that are causing the inflammation, doctors may recommend wearing a brace and may administer steroid injections. Surgical treatment for tennis elbow is relatively rare and only recommended in cases where rest and pain management medications are not working. An arthroscopic procedure to remove damaged and scarred tissue can help repair the muscles and tendons, but there is usually a long recovery time after the surgery. A newer form of treatment for chronic tendon pain and inflammation is the F.A.S.T. procedure (Focused Aspiration of Scar Tissue). This is a less invasive procedure that uses ultrasound imaging and ultrasonic technology to remove tiny bits of damaged tissue without any incisions. Recovery time after this procedure is much shorter than with regular tennis elbow surgery. While pharmacological treatment for pain may help to reduce immediate suffering, medications like NSAIDs and steroid injections come with significant side effects, even if they aren't immediately apparent. Using these kinds of medications long-term to alleviate chronic pain can take their toll, sometimes causing gastrointestinal distress, weight gain, sleep problems, and other side effects that have a negative impact on overall health. Acupuncture treatment can act as [an analgesic to relieve pain](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pain/) without any negative side effects. In fact, the side effects of acupuncture treatment are usually beneficial, including increased circulation, immune function, and stress relief. Can Acupuncture Treat Tennis Elbow? The treatment of chronic pain and inflammation with TCM goes back for many centuries. We use acupuncture and other methods to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation related conditions, including: acupuncture treatment, electro-acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, Tui Na massage, exercise, and Chinese herbs in formulations for both internal (tea or pills) and external (pain patches) use. This multi-pronged approach can be very effective for reducing pain in the short term, while helping tissues to heal over time. A [controlled study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1329-acupuncture-proven-to-heal-tennis-elbow) in which patients suffering from lateral epicondylitis were divided into three groups and treated with either massage or acupuncture, or a combination of both, showed that patients who received the combination treatment experienced, for the most part, a complete recovery after twenty sessions. [Another controlled study](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/41/2/205/1788155) that compared people suffering from chronic tennis elbow who were treated with real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture showed that at both the two week mark and the two month mark, people who had received acupuncture reported less pain and improved function of the arm joints. Exercises and Pressure Points for Tennis Elbow Pain Prevention If you are already experiencing tennis elbow pain or signs of golfer's elbow, you may need to take some time off from sports or make accommodations to your work in order to rest the muscles and tendons of the forearm.

Once you're able to start exercising again, try these home remedies for tennis elbow that will help to prevent tendon problems in the future: - To prevent repetitive stress conditions like tennis elbow and golfer's elbow when playing sports, be sure to always warm up before playing and cool down afterwards.

[ How to Treat Toothaches With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sharp tooth pain, toothache, or throbbing pain in teeth usually means you need to see the dentist. The pain of dental work often necessitates the use of anesthetics, while post-operative pain from dental surgery is usually treated with over the counter pain medications or opioid painkillers. Acupuncture offers an alternative way of [dealing with dental pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231508/) and can also [relieve the dental anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876382018300544) many people experience when they have to have dental work done. Oral pain makes it hard to eat, hard to talk, hard to even think straight. Mouth pain felt in relation to problems with the teeth, or a hurting tooth, is often nerve pain that may be sharp in one place, or radiate to other parts of your face and head. Acupuncture acts upon the neurotransmitters that carry signals between parts of the body and the brain, helping to block pain sensations and relieving tooth pain. Different types of mouth pain, not necessarily related to dental problems or the teeth, can also be alleviated by acupuncture, including [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), clicking or locking of the jaw, tension from grinding teeth, and dry mouth (xerostomia). Myofascial pain, pain in the muscles of the face, and [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) that cause pain in the neck and side of the head can also be helped with acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture and herbs do not replace the need for regular dental visits or necessary dental procedures. However, [TCM methods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270142/), used in conjunction with good oral hygiene, can help to promote the development of strong teeth in children, and the maintenance of healthy teeth and gums in adults. TCM treatments help improve immune function, as well, which can help prevent mouth infections. While dentists have a variety of anesthetics they can use to help reduce pain during dental procedures, many people find the injection of anesthetic to be painful and anxiety-inducing in and of itself. There are definitely downsides to the pain relief offered during dental visits, so much so that many people avoid going to the dentist, or at the very least wish there was some alternative form of anesthesia. Recently, there is [growing interest and research](https://www.dentistrytoday.com/news/todays-dental-news/item/1847-acupuncture-explored-as-an-alternative-dental-treatment) to show that acupuncture can be an effective means of [providing pain relief](https://medcraveonline.com/JDHODT/evaluation-of-acupressure-effect-on-reducing-the-need-for-dental-injection-in-fixed-prosthodontics.html) before, during, and after dental procedures. It is estimated that up to 30% of people report feeling dental anxiety, while about 10% of patients experience dental phobia. [Acupuncture has been shown](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/FullText/2007/02000/Auricular_Acupuncture_for_Dental_Anxiety__A.13.aspx) to help produce a clinically significant decrease in feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/anxiety/) or fear of going to the dentist. Managing Dental Pain It is common to experience pain while you are waiting to get into the dentist for a toothache caused by a broken filling or because a crown has fallen out. Most dental pain is [usually managed](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/dental-anesthesia#side-effects) with non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), also known as OTC pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. However, some people cannot tolerate the regular use of these medicines, as they can cause damage to the lining of the stomach. Different types of anesthesia used during dental work include: - local anesthetics (lidocaine, articaine, etc.), which numb the area where a tooth is being worked on - sedation (nitrous oxide gas, Valium, Versed, etc.), which helps relax the patient - general anesthesia, which means a patient is rendered unconscious for the duration of the dental procedure Pain after oral surgery is most often treated with over the counter analgesics like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but severe dental pain may be treated with [opioid](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/opioids/more-info) painkillers. Dentists in the U.S. are far [more likely](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2734067) to prescribe opioid pain medications than they do in other countries. Dentists are also more likely to prescribe long-acting opioids, and to prescribe opioids for a longer period of time. The growing numbers of people addicted to opioids in America is largely [due to over-prescription](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(19)30527-6/fulltext) of these drugs. [TCM methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/4800704) like acupuncture can relieve a toothache and reduce post-operative pain and bleeding without side effects or risk of dependence. Can Acupuncture Help Tooth Pain? Acupuncture treatment has an analgesic effect, reducing pain and inflammation of all kinds. Acupuncture not only offers natural pain relief for toothache, but can also help [reduce bleeding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231508/) during dental procedures such as tooth extractions. A [controlled study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/2036-acupuncture-stops-dental-surgery-pain-and-bleeding) that compared two groups of patients have teeth extracted, one group treated with articaine hydrochloride injections and the other groups treated with acupuncture needles, found that pain relief was comparable between the anesthesia and acupuncture groups, while bleeding was less amongst those patients given acupuncture. In addition to helping with pain and bleeding during and after a dental procedure, many people find it helpful to come in and have an acupuncture treatment just prior to their dental appointment in order to help alleviate anxiety. Acupuncture may also help to reduce a person's gag reflex, which can be easily triggered during fittings for orthodontic devices, or impressions. With acupuncture treatment, we can also effectively treat dental [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), allowing for patients to feel more relaxed going into their dental appointment and feel less pain during and after a dental procedure. Top 3 Pressure Points to Help Tooth Pain [Acupressure](https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-point-for-toothache#the-pressure-points) has been shown to help reduce anxiety, gag reflex, and the [need for dental injections](https://medcraveonline.com/JDHODT/evaluation-of-acupressure-effect-on-reducing-the-need-for-dental-injection-in-fixed-prosthodontics.html) for pain during fittings for prosthetics. Specific [points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) and face, in particular, can help relieve toothache and swelling. If you are experiencing acute tooth pain, plan to see your dentist as soon as possible. In the meantime, using these [acupressure points](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pressure-points-for-toothache#best-pressure-points) for toothaches can help you stay calm and alleviate the pain until you can get treatment. - ST6, Stomach Meridian Point 6, is located in the cheek, equidistant between the corner of the mouth and the earlobe. Apply pressure to the jaw muscle here to help relieve toothache and jaw pain. - SI18, Small Intestine Meridian Point 18, is right in the cheek hollow, perpendicular to the corner of the eye and outside of the nose. Apply pressure to this point to help relieve tooth pain and swollen gums. - LI4, Large Intestine Meridian Point 4, is located in the webbing between the thumb and index finger. Squeeze with firm pressure here. Often used to relieve headaches, but this point helps tooth pain, as well. Acupuncture Near Me for Tooth Pain on the Westside of Los Angeles No one likes going to the dentist. However, if you have a hurting tooth but you've been avoiding the dentist out of fear, or if you know you have to have some major work done, and you are dreading it, please consider scheduling an acupuncture appointment before your next dentist appointment. Discover for yourself how acupuncture can help relieve dental anxiety and post-procedural dental pain. You may find you feel much more relaxed about the whole thing, and herbs and acupuncture can help staunch bleeding and speed recovery after dental work. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Quit Smoking With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Have you been trying to stop smoking, but are having a hard time quitting? You know that quitting smoking will definitely improve your overall health and [longevity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447499/), but that doesn't mean it's easy to do. [Acupuncture treatment can reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6662782/) cravings, [alleviate withdrawal symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) of nicotine, and help relieve anxiety you feel when you stop smoking. Smoking tobacco causes several million unnecessary deaths every year, and is associated with multiple chronic diseases, including lung disease, cardiovascular disease, [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), lung cancer and other types of [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/). But deaths related to smoking are just the tip of the iceberg. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm), over 16 million Americans are currently living with a chronic disease caused, at least in part, by smoking. Smoking increases the risk of [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [erectile dysfunction in men (ED)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [low sperm count](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). On average, smoking takes ten years off a person's life. Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? Because once you have a smoking habit, quitting smoking is very hard. Tobacco contains a natural chemical called nicotine. [Nicotine](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/health-information/nicotine-addictive-chemical-tobacco-products) is a highly addictive substance. It acts upon the neurotransmitters in the brain that release dopamine: the \"feel-good\" chemical. When you inhale tobacco smoke, nicotine goes directly to your brain, and you get an immediate \"reward\" in the form of dopamine. Once your brain gets used to this reaction, it wants more of it. Even when you know you should stop smoking, and you want to quit, a part of your brain is signalling you not to stop. Vaping, or smoking from a vape pen, or e-cigarette, is the latest trend. There has been some suggestion that this form of smoking causes less damage than cigarettes do, because Juul pens don't have many of the toxic additives that are in regular cigarettes. So far, researchers don't know how long-term vape use will affect people's overall health. However, it is clear that people who vape can easily become [just as addicted to nicotine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/vaping-nicotine-addiction) as smokers of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes do. Once the brain has become attuned to the dopamine reaction [caused by nicotine,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928221/) a very powerful social-emotional component is added to the physical, chemical component. Being in a place where you have smoked in the past, seeing a friend who smokes, smelling smoke in the air, and of course, seeing an ad for cigarettes-all these sorts of cues in your daily environment can have a dramatic impact on your desire to smoke. Almost half of all smokers in the U.S. make an attempt to quit smoking each year. But, obviously, people fail in their attempts to stop smoking all the time. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include intense anxiety. When faced with a powerful combination of physical and emotional stress, most people will return to that quick fix. Even when a person develops serious problems due to smoking, like a constant cough, [emphysema](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-emphysema-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [sleep apnea/snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [acid reflux/heartburn](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), loss of smell and taste; even when a person knows that second hand smoking can hurt their loved ones, they still may find it impossible to quit. People need help to quit smoking. Typical [smoking cessation aids](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/guide-quitting-smoking/nicotine-replacement-therapy.html) include nicotine gum or patches, medications, and programs designed to educate and support people as they try to overcome smoking addiction. While these methods offer help, they do not work for everybody. Most people have to try to quit smoking many times and try different methods before finding success. Many people gain weight when they quit smoking, because the cravings for a cigarette are replaced by cravings for sweets or other foods and drinks that keep your hands and mouth occupied. It's more than just an oral habit, though; nicotine affects the way your body uses insulin and releases glucose, so when you quit smoking, there is a very real change in blood sugar levels and a subsequent desire to eat more carbohydrates. When it feels like you have to choose between two different risk factors-being a smoker, or being overweight-,it may seem like a hopeless situation. TCM for smoking cessation offers a different, multi-pronged approach. With acupuncture treatment for nicotine addiction, we can work on several of the problems smoking causes at the same time. Using [acupuncture to stimulate](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/want-to-quit-smoking-acupuncture-can-help-you-with-cravings/) specific pressure points for reducing cravings and alleviating symptoms of smoking withdrawal is only one way that TCM can help people quit smoking and regain good health. Our [TCM detox program](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may also be helpful. Top 10 Symptoms of Nicotine Withdrawal When you try quitting smoking \"cold turkey,\" you will probably feel more severe symptoms of withdrawal for the first few days. Withdrawal symptoms can last for several weeks. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include: - Intense cravings for a cigarette that last for 5-10 minutes - Feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)and [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Food cravings, weight gain, rise in blood sugar - Sleep problems, insomnia - Persistent cough, \"smoker's cough\" - Flu-like symptoms: fever, fatigue, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been the common [form of help](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/whats-best-way-quit-smoking-201607089935) for nicotine withdrawal for decades. This involves using nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or lozenges, which help people gradually wean themselves off of nicotine by lowering the dose over time. Nicotine patch side effects can include a rapid heart beat, dizziness, [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and nausea. Medications such as Zyban and Chantix are also used to help people quit smoking. Zyban (Bupropion) is also known as Welbutrin, which is used to treat [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A prescription medication called [Varenicline (Chantix)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534846/) is the newest medical treatment available to help people stop smoking. Varenicline works by blocking the receptors in the brain that react to nicotine to stimulate dopamine production. Varenicline is still fairly new, and researchers do not yet know the long-term effects of taking it. Common Chantix side effects include nausea, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), and headaches; more serious psychiatric reactions, such as depression and suicidal ideation have also been reported. Drug interventions for smoking cessation are more effective when combined with education and counseling. The most effective methods to help people stop smoking treat both the brain chemistry that is causing nicotine addiction and the emotional symptoms that arise when quitting. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs are naturally able to help address addiction because they work on the whole person-physically, mentally, and spiritually. How Can Acupuncture Help You Quit Smoking? In conventional medical terms, we mostly think of cigarette smoking as being harmful to the lungs, due to smoke inhalation, and the cardiovascular system, due to the well-known fast heartbeat we associate with nicotine use. In TCM, we do consider that smoking weakens the lungs, but this, in turn, causes problems in the other major organ systems of the body. A buildup of heat in the Heart and Stomach can lead to stagnant Liver Qi. These forces are what cause the withdrawal symptoms of anxious feelings, heart palpitations, irritability, food cravings, and poor sleep. [With acupuncture](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-10857-0_16) and herbs, we work to clear heat and detoxify the lungs and all of the organs. A [specific set of points](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) on the outer ear are often used to help combat the cravings associated with overcoming addictions of all kinds, including nicotine dependence. Often we will send a patient home with small ear seeds fixed to these points so that they can be squeezed and stimulated whenever you feel an urge to smoke. This will also help with food cravings and prevent overeating and weight gain when you quit smoking. Acupuncture helps to release endorphins, replacing the familiar dopamine hit with a different sense of relaxation. Endorphins promote a sense of wellbeing and relieve pain. Dopamine works on the reward center of the brain, causing a mental and emotional reaction that leads to addiction. Acupuncture treatment works holistically to help relieve emotional pain-symptoms of anxiety and depression-by positively impacting neurochemical activity. Shifting from dopamine dependence to more abundant endorphins and serotonin will help restore restful sleep. A [controlled trial study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447300/) compared patients who received acupuncture, patients who received acupuncture and education and counseling, and patients who received sham acupuncture to help them quit smoking over a period of four weeks. The percentage rate of patients who had quit smoking after 18-month follow up was highest among those who received acupuncture, and especially highest among those who had acupuncture and counseling. [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5149689/) of almost 3000 people who received acupuncture treatment for smoking over an eight week period showed that the treatment helped many people abstain from cigarettes, and helped many more to cut back on how many cigarettes they smoked. Chinese Medicine Near Me to Stop Smoking in the Great Los Angeles Area The decision to quit smoking for good can be a life-changing one. But for most people, it's also one of the most difficult things they will ever do. Cigarettes are addictive, and to stop smoking, you may need professional help. If you've already tried NRT and not been able to finally quit, you may want to consider trying the TCM approach. Whether you chain smoke or only vape socially, whether you are quitting smoking because you want to increase your chances of getting pregnant, or you have lung cancer stage 4, it is never too early or too late to stop smoking. Acupuncture for smoking cessation can help you get past the cravings for cigarettes that make it so hard to quit. Acupuncture and herbs can not only help you kick the habit, but can also help you get rid of that cough, brighten your skin, and sleep better. Most of all, you will have made an important choice to prioritize your health and prevent chronic illness from taking hold later in life. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.
