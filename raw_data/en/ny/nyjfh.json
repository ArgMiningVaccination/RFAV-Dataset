Stage of collecting information has been finalized between October2012 -January1013 Aimed three basic analysis: -Impact of animal movement and animal trade pattern on disease dynamics and role of milk collectors for disease transmission -Impact of animal husbandry system on disease dynamic ; Role of SR for disease transmission -Impact of vaccination on control of the disease; between where vaccination apply and species Data cleaning and analysing have been continued, results will be available soon 1. Vaccination New vaccination strategy based on risk analysis has been initiated, since it has been insufficient vaccine resource, since it has been insufficient vaccine resource: -Preventive campaign vaccination; acc.to risk analysis developing a vacc.program before each campaign - where /which species vaccine apply LR; twice a year, vacc not apply as campaign in Anatolia;_In Thrace: LR: Twice a year/SR: once -Ring Vaccination to response outbreak in Surveillance zone of outbreak -Targeting vaccination for \"Hotspot\"; extending ring vaccination with specific serotype 2. Diagnosis and Genetic and Antigenic Characterization of Isolates 3. Epidemiological investigation _ Active and passive surveillance - Outbreak investigation and case study - Serosurveillance; NSP Prevalence estimation in Anatolia/Disease detection in Thrace 4. Routine control measures in case of disease outbreak (biosecurity, restriction, quarantine, sampling) 5. Control of animal movements and markets 6. Training vets and awareness activities 7. Vaccine effectiveness study to evalute vaccine used and appl ication of vacc . FMD Control Strategy Conducted in Turkey Results of Surveillance IDENTIFICATION OF CIRCULATING STRAIN FMD is endemic in Anatolia region in Turkey Current Circulating virus strains: -Serotype O (O PanAsiaII ), - A (A -Asia-1(Asia1/SINDH08) 1038 outbreaks recorded in Anatolia in 2012; 847 out of them were serotyped by national reference lab, 90 were untyped (virus not detected or only positive FMD), 101 were reported by clinical diagnosis. In 2013, up to 20th March, 1 31 outbreak were recorded and serotyped 2012 Anatolian Outbreaks; distribution by serotype and 14, 11% 5, 4% 13, 10% 2013 Anatolian Outbreaks Type O A West 2012 Anatolian Outbreaks Anatolian Outbreaks for Second Half of 2012 West EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Map Distribution total Serotypes A (AIRN 05) O (PanAsia II) Asia 1- Sindh08 O ANT -10 1 1 O BAL -11 5 5 O FAR -09 49 49 A-SIS-10 24 24 A USK -11 13 13 A AMS -12 50 50 A WES -11 2 2 A KES -12 9 9 A BAB -12 9 9 Asia1 - Sindh08 79 79 Asia1 -Sindh - 08ERN-12 6 6 Grand Total 107 55 85 277 GENETIC CHARACTERIZATON FOR 2012 AND 2013 FIELD ISOLATES 2012 Sub-groups 2013 Grand total Serotypes A (AIRN 05) O (PanAsia II) Asia 1-Sindh08 -09 8 O PanAsiaII /FAR - 09/GUM13 16 16 A-SIS-10/A AMS -12 3 3 A-SIS-10/A BAB -12 13 13 Asia1 -Sindh08 2 2 Grand Total 16 24 2 42 A-SIS-10/A BAB -12 is new incursion detected on November ; O FAR09/GUM is also considered as exotic but not found indication yet West EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Aralk 2012 Ocak 2013 ubat 2013 Distribution of Sublineages of Type O PanAsiaII /FAR09/GUM -13 isolates sampled in 2012 -2013 by timeline and georaphically BY AP INSTITUTE West EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Distribution of Sublineages of Type A Iran05/SIS10 /BAB -12 isolates sampled in 2012 -2013 by timeline and georaphically July 2012 August 2012 September 2012 October 2012 November 2012 December 2012 January 2013 February 2013 March 2013 BY AP INSTITUTE West EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, A NSP Serosurveillance has been conducted in Anatolia in Autumn 2012 Objective: Estimation of NSP preval ence and risk analysis Species: (Cattle ); SR(Sheep and goat) Sample Frame: 31 LR and -High prevalence was estimated in east region -Because of impact of Asia -1 outbreaks, higher prevalence was estimated in west area when compared with 1010 Surveiallance -Higher prevalence was detected in Sheep rather than cattle and goat, but west area sheep prevalence also was low than east area -poor outbreak reporting was detected in the east; Anatolian movement pattern was effected on transmission dynamic, population density particularly in the west not related to directly -not detected any finding on transmission between species; neg NSP for LR despite high pos rate for SR in the same epi -unit Results EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Vaccination Policy Used for Spring Vaccination campaign Map Distribution for Spring Vaccination Campaign Ring vaccination in protection and surveillance zone of outbreaks Provinces implemented vaccination campaign West EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Vaccination campaign for Autumn 2012 Provinces vaccinated with Trivalent vaccine by campaign Ring vaccination was implement , response to the outbreak in remained (white color ) area West EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Vaccine used for 2012 Sring vaccination campaign Campaign vaccination: 1,985 million doses Trivalent vaccine vaccination: vaccine In Coverage achieved: 97% in Thrace; 76% in Anatolia where vaccination applied Vaccine used for 2012 Autumn vaccination campaign Campaign vaccination: 5.096.250 doses Trivalent Coverage achieved: 98% in Thrace; 79% in EurAsia FMD Control -Roadmap 2025, Regions included vaccination and allocated vaccine for Spring 2013 Campaign Regions have been included in Spring vaccination campaign in Turkey according to risk assessment: Campaign vaccination in Spring2013 : - Eagan (except Mula ), - Marmara and and Mediterranean ; Burdur and Isparta ) - Two provinces in East Anatolia , Malatya and Elaz Specific vaccination policy to response type A outbreaks using monovalent type A vaccine Extended ring vaccination has been used for type A outbreak - according to risk assessment all population in district in which occurred outbreak: It has been already initiated since January 2013 Ring vaccination to reponse outbreak for serotype O and Asia, has been used In remained area of Turkey, - when occurrence outbreak, livestock in protected and surveillance zone of outbreaks will be vaccinated as ring vaccination co ncept. ONLY LARGE RUMINANTS HAS BEEN INCLUDED FOR CAMPAIGN ALLOCATED AMOUNT OF VACCINE -Campaign vaccination: 5 million trivalent (O to be implemented Spring2013 Vaccination Campaign LR vaccination as campaign Ring vaccination to rensponse outbreaks * In all area, specific extended ring vaccination to type A outbreaks by monovalent vaccine West EurAsia FMD Yes; Serosurveillance results indicated that where control measures has been applied better, the disease impact has been reduced It was observed that the number of outbreaks and affected animals were sharply decreased after vaccination applied ; for example, Asia-1 outbreaks occurred severely in West area of Turkey in Spring 2012 Low incidence was detected in area which biosecurity and other control measures was implemented much more better -Are control measures moving towards FMD elimination? No, it has been not found any indication yet . Critical assessment on if strategy is achieving the goal Short term Plan for Surveillance and Control Passive surveillance program will be continued including outbreak investigation and typing as in routine Ear-tag system will be replaced with barcode system for LR and SR New sensitive surveillance system has been lau nched in Thrace, activities will be started afterward this month Longterm Plan for Surveillance and Control In framework of National Veterinary Strategy Plan, a study for socio - economic impact of FMD will be carried out in 2014 As requirement of Directive \"Standard of Storage, Delivery and Marketing for Veterinary Medicine, Biological Substance and Vaccine\", some work plan has been initiated: -2D Barcode System for veterinary medicine and vaccine will be implemented -A vaccine storage rooms based on standard will be constructed in eac provincial directorate Plans related to FMD surveillance and control in the short and long term.
