Introduction [1](#B1-jfb-14-00454)]. Current scientific developments demonstrate the effectiveness of local or targeted drug delivery systems (DDS) using hydrogels. For economic and technical reasons, hydrogels represent a safer, cleaner, and non-toxic way to develop DDS [ [2](#B2-jfb-14-00454)]. Hydrogels are the most suitable \"vehicles\" for the local administration of drugs because they allow drug delivery without causing adverse side effects. The widespread use of hydrogels for DDS development is mainly attributed to their excellent properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, increased drug loading capacity, and controlled drug release. In addition, hydrogels are generating more interest because their mechanical properties can be easily tailored to mimic the extracellular matrix of most tissues [ [3](#B3-jfb-14-00454)]. [4](#B4-jfb-14-00454)]. [5](#B5-jfb-14-00454)]. [6](#B6-jfb-14-00454)]. [7](#B7-jfb-14-00454)]. Besides the fact that it provides structural support, it has a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, in absorbing the exudate and accelerating the natural wound-healing process [ [8](#B8-jfb-14-00454)]. Due to its hydrophilic character, CMC has a high affinity for water and excellent compatibility with the human skin, ensuring an optimal moist environment at the wound site, and contributing to the re-epithelialization process [ [9](#B9-jfb-14-00454)]. [10](#B10-jfb-14-00454), [11](#B11-jfb-14-00454), [12](#B12-jfb-14-00454)]. Tich\u00fd et al. evaluated the effects of the moist heat sterilization process on the rheological and structural properties of CMC hydrogels [ [13](#B13-jfb-14-00454)]. Wang et al. prepared a CMC/poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) hydrogel with good mechanical properties and swelling ability for wound dressing applications using -irradiation [ [14](#B14-jfb-14-00454)]. PVP/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels were synthesized by e-beam irradiation and it has been observed that they have enough strength and can be used as a barrier against microbes; moreover, the irradiation dose had a significant role in the mechanical properties' improvement [ [15](#B15-jfb-14-00454)]. PVP/PEG/agar hydrogel wound dressings were developed by -irradiation and showed that the addition of PEG improves the elasticity, adhesion, and overall hydrogel quality [ [16](#B16-jfb-14-00454)]. Soler et al. produced pilot-scale batches of PVP/PEG/agar dressings, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve both hydrogel cross-linking and its sterilization by -irradiation in a single technological step using the dose of 25 kGy [ [17](#B17-jfb-14-00454)]. The hydrogel dressings based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and PVA were synthesized by e-beam irradiation. Hydrogels with high PEO content had increased gel fractions but were brittle. Their mechanical properties were improved due to the addition of PVA and radiation-induced cross-linking. The healing of wounds treated with such hydrogels is rapid, compared to healing in the open air, as shown by in vivo studies performed on marmots [ [6](#B6-jfb-14-00454)]. Chitosan (CS)/PVA dressings hemostatic, using -radiation [ [18](#B18-jfb-14-00454)]. CS/PVP/agar hydrogel wound dressing was CS-based hydrogel showed an antimicrobial [19](#B19-jfb-14-00454)]. CS/gelatin hybrid hydrogels and CS/gelatin loaded with silver nanoparticles were produced by -radiation cross-linking at ambient temperature. The hydrogels exhibited appropriate mechanical and biological properties as well as long-term antibacterial activity [ [20](#B20-jfb-14-00454), [21](#B21-jfb-14-00454)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials [22](#B22-jfb-14-00454)]; carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMCNa, Mw = 2.5 \u00d7 105 of substitution, DS = 0.77, viscosity 735 cps, 2% in water, Mw = 72.06 g/mol). All reagents (except collagen gel) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (currently Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and used without further purification. Deionized water (DI-water) was prepared in the INFLPR laboratory (resistivity 18.2 M, conductivity 0.055 S). covalent bonds offers a new approach regarding the development of topical drug delivery systems. Despite this advantage, CMC along with other natural polymers, such as collagen and chitosan, has low mechanical strength and high biodegradability. For this reason, the association between CMC, collagen, and synthetic polymers such as PVP, which has a low swelling capacity, offers the possibility of obtaining biostable hydrogels due to the affinity of PVP to cross-link easily through irradiation and forming 3D networks that are soft and flexible. Collagen as an ingredient in a multi-component hydrogel can also increase the loading capacity of various bioactive substances, but its major role in this recipe is to facilitate the interaction between cells and the designed hydrogel by increasing cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Polymers such as PEG or PEO have the role of increasing the flexibility and elasticity of the structure of a hydrogel. They contain electron-donating groups that ensure a better binding of bioactive substances but also increase hydrophilicity. 2.3. E-Beam and Water Vapor Transmission Rate [29](#B29-jfb-14-00454)]. [30](#B30-jfb-14-00454)]: 2.4.4. Network Structural Parameters [31](#B31-jfb-14-00454), [32](#B32-jfb-14-00454)]: [33](#B33-jfb-14-00454)], PVP = 12.3 [ [34](#B34-jfb-14-00454)], CS = 32.8 [ [35](#B35-jfb-14-00454)], CMC = 10 [ [36](#B36-jfb-14-00454)], AA = 6.7 [ [37](#B37-jfb-14-00454)], PEG/PEO = 4.0 [ [27](#B27-jfb-14-00454)]. Mr is the molecular weight of the monomer unit, taken as a weighted average of the molecular weights: collagen = 321.32 g/mol; PVP = PEG/PEO 2.4.7. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 2.5. In Vitro Biological Characterization 2.5.1. Cell Culture Model and Extraction Medium Preparation [40](#B40-jfb-14-00454)]. In essence, the sterilized hydrogels were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in standard culture medium free of serum, at a ratio of the surface area to the volume of extractant used of 3 cm2/mL. In the end, the resulting extracts were collected and supplemented with 10% FBS for their further use in cell culture-based studies. 2.5.2. Indirect Contact Studies 2.5.3. Direct Contact Studies 2.6. Statistical Analysis 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Sol-Gel Analysis [Figure 1](#jfb-14-00454-f001)shows the appearance of the multi-component hydrogels obtained after e-beam irradiation in different shapes. It can be seen that all hydrogels are transparent, maintain their structure, are non-adhesive when handling, and most importantly, especially from the point of view of the application, they have an elastic structure. [Figure 2](#jfb-14-00454-f002)a illustrates the gel fraction as a function of the absorbed dose. The gel fraction is increased even at low doses. For example, at 5 kGy it is greater than 70%, a value confirmed for all of the studied hydrogel compositions and which increased with the absorbed dose. The highest GF was obtained for composition PD9, over 90% at 5 kGy. For compositions PD81 and PD10 at absorbed doses above 20 kGy, the GF remains constant and is between 90% and 97%. The PD9 composition, unlike the PD81 and PD10 compositions, cross-links very quickly, this being the direct contribution of the cross-linking agent (MBA), but also of the increased PVP concentration. With the increase in the absorbed dose, no degradative contribution was observed regarding the GF. The radiation-induced cross-linking of biopolymers is generally accompanied by significant degradation of the polymer chain, visible through the decrease of the GF. From [Figure 2](#jfb-14-00454-f002)a, it can also be seen that in the case of compositions PD81 and PD10, in which the concentration of biopolymers (collagen, CMC, or chitosan) is higher, higher irradiation doses are needed to increase the GF above 75%. In the PD81 composition in which no cross-linking agent was added, the cross-linking reaction occurs only due to the contribution of synthetic polymers. In a polymeric system consisting of both synthetic and natural polymers, the degradative effects can compete with the cross-linking ones. In this case, from a practical point of view, it can be done either by increasing the irradiation dose or by using an appropriate concentration of cross-linking agent. [41](#B41-jfb-14-00454)]. Therefore, the association of biopolymers with synthetic polymers significantly improves the yield of the cross-linking reaction, which is demonstrated in this study. [42](#B42-jfb-14-00454), [43](#B43-jfb-14-00454)]. For polymer mixtures that form insoluble fractions as a result of cross-linking induced by irradiation, the ratio p0/q0 is less than 2, which shows that the cross-linking processes are predominant [ [19](#B19-jfb-14-00454)]. [Table 2](#jfb-14-00454-t002)and [Figure 2](#jfb-14-00454-f002)b, it can be seen that the ratio p0/q0 is between 0.12 and 0.31, which according to the previous literature data proves that the cross-linking processes are predominant. The second method of evaluating the irradiation process of the developed hydrogels from aqueous polymer mixtures consists of quantifying the effect of ionizing radiation, both in terms of cross-linking and degradation of polymer chains. For this purpose, the following parameters are frequently used: radiochemical yield of cross-linking G(X), and radiochemical yield of degradation, G(S). To determine G(X), respectively, G(S), it is necessary to know the absorbed dose [ [44](#B44-jfb-14-00454)]. [Table 3](#jfb-14-00454-t003)shows the values of the G(X), respectively, of G(S) depending on the absorbed dose and the composition of the hydrogels. For all hydrogel compositions tested, a general trend of G(X) decreasing with increasing the absorbed dose was observed. At irradiation doses between 5 and 10 kGy, the cross-linking yields increase in the order PD81 < PD9 < PD10, and in the dose range 20-30 kGy, G(X) has approximately constant values. 3.2. Swelling Degree [9](#B9-jfb-14-00454)]. The lower swelling capacity of the PD9 hydrogel can be explained by the increase in the cross-linking density, this being a direct consequence of the use of an increased concentration of PVP, but also of the use of MBA as a cross-linking agent. [41](#B41-jfb-14-00454)] and carboxymethylchitosan hydrogels [ [45](#B45-jfb-14-00454)]. [Figure 3](#jfb-14-00454-f003)it can also be observed that in a neutral environment, the swelling degree is higher than the corresponding one in acidic and basic environments. This results from the activation of the deprotonation mechanisms of proton donor groups (, COOH, OH), as a result of the disintegration of inter-molecular or intramolecular cross-linking points in acidic and basic environments, which ultimately leads to an increase in the mesh size of the hydrogels' network, so there is an increase in fluid absorption in the macromolecular network of the hydrogel [ [46](#B46-jfb-14-00454)]. Moreover, increased absorption in an alkaline environment is beneficial in the case of using hydrogels as dressings for chronic wounds. The greater ability to swell in the case of the PD81 composition is mainly due to the low concentration of polymers, but also to the increased concentration of hydrophilic components such as collagen and CMC. 3.3. Network Parameters [47](#B47-jfb-14-00454)]. [48](#B48-jfb-14-00454)]. [Table 4](#jfb-14-00454-t004)shows the structural parameters of the multi-component hydrogels obtained by irradiation with a dose of 25 kGy. The network parameters Mc, , and Ve varied according to the composition of the hydrogels as follows: the PD81 composition has the highest cross-linking density (Ve = 1.17 mol/m3), which shows the formation of a hydrogel with a dense structure and high stability. [41](#B41-jfb-14-00454)], an improved cross-linking has been observed in the case of CMC/acrylic acid hydrogels produced by gamma-radiation synthesis. They assumed that due to the higher mobility of acrylic acid molecules than CMC macromolecules, the cross-linking was significantly improved. Another factor has been attributed to the lower solution viscosity, which improves the mobility of the CMC chains. Based on this information, and also on the fact that by using a polymer with a lower molecular mass such as PVP 360, the resulting polymer solution does not have high viscosity. With the loss or decrease of the elasticity of a hydrogel network, the viscous character of the system becomes more pronounced. This behavior can be visualized very well from the values of elastic moduli vs. loss moduli. If the viscous character (G) is larger than the elastic one (G > G), then it can be assumed that cross-linking has been compromised. As can be seen from [Figure 4](#jfb-14-00454-f004)b, this behavior was not identified for any of the compositions studied. [49](#B49-jfb-14-00454)]. Considering the above results, the PD81 and PD9 compositions are selected for future studies. 3.4. Rheological Analysis [50](#B50-jfb-14-00454), [51](#B51-jfb-14-00454)]. [52](#B52-jfb-14-00454), [53](#B53-jfb-14-00454)]. The viscoelastic according to recipes PD81, PD9, and PD10 was investigated by oscillatory rheology in a dynamic regime. The G and G parameters specific to unirradiated (pre-hydrogels) and e-beam cross-linked hydrogels are shown in [Figure 4](#jfb-14-00454-f004)a,b. Unirradiated polymer mixtures show very low G values (around 20-200 Pa) and have a variable behavior depending on the angular frequency. Such rheological behavior is characteristic of viscous fluids with homogeneous structures. [54](#B54-jfb-14-00454)]. Consequently, this rheological behavior is characteristic of soft solids such as hydrogels, which have a predominantly elastic and permanent macromolecular network. [Figure 4](#jfb-14-00454-f004)c. According to literature data, ideal solids should have a complex modulus equal to the elastic modulus (G* = G), and an ideal liquid has G* = G. Thus, G* can be considered as a measure of the stiffness of the material and shows the total resistance of the hydrogels when an appropriate force is applied [ [55](#B55-jfb-14-00454)]. [Figure 4](#jfb-14-00454-f004)d, for extended analysis, the experimental data can be evaluated concisely and suggestively employing the loss tangent (tan = G/G). The dimensionless ratio shows values lower than 1 for the irradiated compositions, compared to the values corresponding to the unirradiated mixtures. Very low values of the loss tangent (lower than 101) are indicative of hydrogels obtained by irradiation, due to the preponderance of the elastic component. Conversely, for the unirradiated mixtures, the tan values were much higher (around 1), a consequence of their viscoelastic behavior. 3.5. Retention Capability and Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) [Table 5](#jfb-14-00454-t005), it is obvious that multi-component hydrogels retain between 84.8% and 89.2% of moisture after 12 h. Rh (%) in 6 h was similar for all the hydrogels, above 90% at room temperature, regardless of their cross-linking density. The Rh of the hydrogels was comparable to other PVP/CMC hydrogels which had a value of 70% after about 6 h [ [14](#B14-jfb-14-00454)]. Thus, maintaining increased humidity in wounds covered with such a hydrogel provides a beneficial environment for much faster healing. [Table 6](#jfb-14-00454-t006)shows the WVTR values obtained for the kGy ( [Figure 5](#jfb-14-00454-f005)). [18](#B18-jfb-14-00454)]. If the WVTR value is high, it causes the wound to dry quickly, which is not beneficial for the intended application. Moreover, if the WVTR is low, then excess exudate occurs, which slows down the wound healing process and increases the risk of infection. [56](#B56-jfb-14-00454)]. Based on the data reported in reference [ [30](#B30-jfb-14-00454)], the WVTR of some commercial dressings ranges from 33 g/m2h to 208 g/m2\u00b7h, indicating that the WVTRs of the designed hydrogels in the present study are within a suitable range for wound healing [ [57](#B57-jfb-14-00454)]. 3.6. ATR-FTIR [Figure 6](#jfb-14-00454-f006)a shows the characteristic irradiated hydrogels. The 965 cm1 of aromatic nuclei in PEO). In the FTIR spectrum for the PD81 hydrogel, it was observed that in the range of 3500-2800 cm1 the absorption bands become broad and increase in intensity. The peak at 3386 cm1 shifted to lower wavenumbers at 3373 cm1 peak at 2949 cm1 shifted to cm1. The characteristic peak of amide I (1650 cm1) shows the same intensity. 3.7. SEM [Figure 7](#jfb-14-00454-f007). It is observed that the structure of the multi-component hydrogels varied depending on the composition. The PD81 and PD9 hydrogels present porous structures with pores that are homogeneously distributed which outline a network structure with a 3D conformation. The PD81 hydrogel presents in its structure uniformly distributed micropores with a size between 50-100 \u00b5m. As also revealed in the swelling experiments, this structure has better swelling capacity in media with different pH, which also gives a better drug loading capacity to this hydrogel. The PD9 hydrogel, although it exhibits a homogeneously distributed pore structure, at 1000\u00d7 magnifications a structure with pores smaller than 50 \u00b5m, which gives the hydrogel an increased structural rigidity, ultimately leads to a lower swelling capacity. These results correlate very well with the results obtained in the swelling experiments and rheological analysis, which showed that the PD9 hydrogel has a low liquid absorption capacity and increased rheological stiffness. PD10 hydrogel exhibits a microporous structure with inhomogeneous distributed pores that are large compared to the structures of PD81 and PD9 hydrogels, which shows the structurally weaker quality of PD10 hydrogel. The SEM analysis demonstrates that PD10 hydrogel also presented low cross-linking density (0.37) compared to PD81 (1.17) and PD9 (0.78) hydrogels. The low cross-linking density PD10 the result of electrostatic repulsion between proton donor-type functional groups such as COOH (arise from acrylic acid) and OH (due to the PEG addition), resulting in a lower mechanical strength. 3.8. In Vitro Biological Performance [Figure 8](#jfb-14-00454-f008)a, the time-response study of the total number of metabolically active viable cells revealed a decreasing trend in the proliferative capacity of the cells cultured in the extraction media compared to the control cells grown in the standard medium at any point in time. This being said, it can be observed that at 24 h the cellular viability of the extracts was reduced two-fold (45%) compared to the cells grown in a standard culture medium considered as 100% viability, while at 72 h the viability decreased as follows: 69% and 61% for the PD81 and PD9 extraction media, respectively, and almost two-fold (57%) for the PD10 extract. Moreover, the optical densities (OD) recorded in the case of the cells grown in the corresponding extracts indicated no significant differences between the three analyzed samples, the trend observed only after 24 h of culture. On the contrary, at 72 h after cell seeding, noticeable differences in the number of viable cells between the hydrogels extraction media could be observed, with the PD9 and PD10 extracts showing lower levels of formazan reduction as compared to the PD81 extract. The findings are also confirmed by phase contrast micrographs showing contrasting cellular densities at both experimental time points, suggesting that, to different degrees ( [Figure 8](#jfb-14-00454-f008)b), the analyzed extraction media favored cell proliferation without any major deleterious effects. However, even if the extraction media of the newly developed hydrogels proved to hinder cell proliferation, an assessment of which component can be at fault is quite difficult since data found in the literature report on their low toxicity and favorable cell proliferation capacity. [Figure 8](#jfb-14-00454-f008)b), strong evidence that the anchorage-dependent growth and morphological features of cells were not affected by the investigated extracts. [Figure 9](#jfb-14-00454-f009)a) revealed significant differences between the developed hydrogels in terms of cell density, a trend observed at both experimental time points. However, no dead red-stained cells could be observed on the surface of the tested supports, except for the PD10 sample, suggesting that the analyzed hydrogels were capable of sustaining cellular survival to a certain degree. In addition, the quantitative CCK-8 assay ( [Figure 9](#jfb-14-00454-f009)b) demonstrated that, independently of the incubation period, statistically significant differences between the analyzed samples were observed, with the cells grown on the surface of the PD10 hydrogel exhibiting reduced cellular viability compared to the other two hydrogels, indicating either an inhibitory cellular metabolic activity or a restrictive proliferation capacity. Furthermore, the levels of LDH release into the culture media ( [Figure 9](#jfb-14-00454-f009)c) confirm the obtained CCK-8 assay results. [58](#B58-jfb-14-00454)]. Thus, the obtained results can be explained through the PD10 hydrogel unsatisfying physicochemical features such as a non-homogenous structure, a reduced cross-linking density correlated with a low G modulus and impaired mechanical stability, characteristics which could negatively impact the initial cellular attachment and cell viability. Moreover, the collagen/chitosan hydrogel exhibited a higher rate of degradation in culture conditions which could lead to a possible restriction of nutrients and metabolites due to the formation of a viscous shell on top of the hydrogel, a phenomenon also reported by Deng et al. in their study [ [59](#B59-jfb-14-00454)]. 4.
