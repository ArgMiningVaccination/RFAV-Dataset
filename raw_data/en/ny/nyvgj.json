Tonight, I made one of my favorite fall soups and it's on the heartier side. I forgot how much I loved it and ate a much larger bowl than I was intending. A few weeks ago, this sort of thing would have lead to a night of nausea, stomach pain, and entire back spasms from my digestive system being so out of wack. I don't feel any of those things and while I feel fuller than I ever like to be it isn't sick or painful. I am overwhelmed with gratitude for what you and acupuncture have done for me. ~ Kelsey Cosmetic Acupuncture Also known as Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture, this proved cosmetic procedure encourages your body to produce more collagen and elastin which is healing for your skin and creates a more youthful appearance.

It uses the same principles as Cosmetic Acupuncture but targets collagen-producing skin layers in a more intense way. Nano-needling punctures only the first layer of the skin, creating nano channels, while micro-needling penetrates into the deep dermis. These techniques are much less expensive than cosmetic laser treatments, and many people report experiencing similar results with them. Available in Lakeville and Apple Valley.

Acupuncture is one of the modalities of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has been practiced for over 2,000 years and has helped billions of people. Acupuncture is the insertion of disposable, fine needles into the body at specific points. Acupuncture points are stimulated to balance the movement of energy (qi) in the body to promote natural healing. Acupuncture is a safe, painless, and effective way to treat a wide variety of medical problems without side effects. What to expect from the initial consultation and treatment? During your initial consultation, you will spend time discussing your health concerns with your acupuncturist and he or she will collect a detailed history. There will be ample time for questions and answers. Expect your acupuncturist to look at your tongue, (please don't brush your tongue or chew gum before your appointment), take your pulse, and possibly palpate acupuncture points. You should wear loose clothes that are comfortable to lie down in for 30 minutes and be sure to eat within four hours of your appointment. Set aside enough time so that you are not rushing to and from your visit. Physical strain immediately before or after acupuncture can weaken your body. Acupuncture with Nara has helped my back pain so much! She is attentive, kind, and she really cares. Session with her are like a little healing retreat each week. I can't recommend her enough. ~ M Does acupuncture hurt? No, acupuncture should not hurt. Sometimes a momentary prick is felt at the insertion of the needle, but most patients say they barely feel the needle go in. The needle is placed in specific acupuncture points to create stimulation, and therefore the patient most likely will feel different sensations. Some people describe the sensation as heavy, dull pressure, tingling, and aching, for example. Most people are amazed by how relaxed they feel during and after the treatment. Acupuncture treatments are comfortable and gentle and patients often fall asleep. How does acupuncture work? TCM theory includes the study of fourteen meridians that cover the entire body and connect with organs or organ systems. Meridians are like rivers inside the body. Qi (energy), like water in a river, flows through meridians as an invisible current nourishing and energizing every cell, tissue, organ, and muscle. Acupuncturists develop diagnostic skills to effectively evaluate the quality and quantity of qi flowing within the body, then use tiny needles to stimulate specific points to help nurture your body back to health by helping to resolve energy imbalances. I have found a calming sense, a peaceful state that happened at the first visit and has been built on ever since. I am a survivor of breast cancer that has metastasized to my bones. Acupuncture has brought relief from the bone pain that I was experiencing when I started treatment. I would like to continue on this path of well-being that has made a believer out of me. ~ Dorothy, cancer patient How many treatments will I need? This is unique to the individual and the condition that is being treated. Some people experience immediate relief, others may take months to achieve results. Chronic conditions usually take longer to resolve than acute ones. For example, if the problem is acute sometimes improvement is felt after one treatment, and then maybe you will only need three to five treatments to resolve. On the other hand if you suffer from a chronic condition it may take many treatments to help resolve. What can I do to prepare for my first visit? Think about what you would like to accomplish by receiving your acupuncture treatment. At the first visit, your acupuncturist will ask what the main condition is that you want to be treated for. It is helpful if you pay attention to your body and the condition that needs attention. For example, think of words to describe the pain or discomfort you feel. Also, pay attention to how frequently you notice the condition and what makes it better or worse. Giving your acupuncturist as many details as possible will help them to treat you more effectively. I tried acupuncture after having sinus infections for years. I took one round of medicine after another but felt worse and worse. I also had a lot of joint pain. With acupuncture my health is better and my joint pain is gone and only two minor infections this year and they cleared up on their own in a couple of days - and no antibiotics at all. ~ Laurie What conditions can be treated by acupuncture?
