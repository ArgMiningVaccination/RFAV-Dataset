The Plan is not insured. Cont ributions received from Covered Persons are used to cover Plan costs and are expended immediately. As such, when applicable, Federal law and jurisdiction preempt State law and jurisdiction. GENERAL AUTHORITY OF THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR Subject to the Claims administration duties delegat ed to the Claim Administrator, the Plan Administrator reserves the unilateral right and power to administer and to interpret, construe and construct the terms and provisions of the Plan, includ ing, without limitation, correcti ng any error or defect, supplying any omission, reconciling any inconsistency and making factual determinations. The Plan will be interpreted by the Plan Administrator in accordance with the te rms of the Plan and their intended meanings. However, the Plan Administrator sh all have the discretion to interpret or construe ambiguous, unclear or implied (but omitted) terms in any fashion it deems to be appropriate in its sole judgment. The validity of any such finding of fact, in terpretation, construction or decision shall be upheld in any legal action and shall be binding and conclusive on all interested parties unless clearly arbitrary and capricious. To the extent the Plan Administrator has been grant ed discretionary authority under the Plan, the prior exercise of such authority by the Plan Administrator s hall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. If due to errors in drafting, any Plan provision does not accurately reflect its intended meaning, as demonstrated by prior interpretations or other evi dence of intent, or as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole and exclusive judgment, t he provision shall be considered ambiguous and shall be interpreted by the Plan Administrator in a fashion co nsistent with its intent, as determined by the Plan Administrator. The Plan may be amended retroactiv ely to cure any such ambiguity, notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary. The foregoing provisions of this Plan may not be invoked by any person to require the Plan to be interpreted in a manner which is inconsistent with its interpretations by the Plan Administrator. All actions taken and all determinations by the Plan Administrator shall be final and binding upon all persons claiming any interest under the Plan subject only to the Claims appeal procedures of the Plan. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN The Plan Administrator has full charge of the o peration and management of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has retained the services of the Cl aims Administrator, an independent Claims processor experienced in Claims review. The Plan Administrator is the named Fiduciary of the Plan except as noted herein. The Plan Administrator maintains discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Plan, including but not limited to, determination of eligibility for and entitlement to Plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan; any interpretation or determination made pursuant to su ch discretionary authority shall be given full force and effect and shall be binding on all persons, unless it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious. 6 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP The Plan is not intended to disturb the Physician-Pa tient relationship. Physicians and other healthcare Providers are not agents or delegates of the Plan Sponsor, , Plan Administrator, Employer or Claims Administrator. The delivery of medical and other he althcare services on behalf of any Covered Person remains the sole prerogative and responsibility of t he attending Physician or other healthcare Provider. FREE CHOICE OF HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN Nothing contained in this Plan shall in any way or manne r restrict or interfere with the right of any person entitled to benefits hereunder to select a Hospital or to make a free choice of the attending Physician or professional Provider. However, benefits will be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, and the Covered Person may have higher out-of-pocket expenses if the Cove red Person uses the services of a Non-Preferred Provider. PREFERRED PROVIDER INFORMATION This Plan contains provisions under which a Plan Pa rticipant may receive more benefits by using certain Providers. These Providers are indi viduals and entities that have contra cted with the Plan to provide services to Plan Participants at pre-negotiated rates. A list of these Preferred Providers can be accessed on the PPO website free of charge. In addition, a Plan Pa rticipant may request a Preferred Provider list by contacting the Plan Administrator. The Preferred Provider list changes freque ntly; therefore, it is recommended that a Plan Participant ve rify with the Provider that the Pr ovider is still a Pr eferred Provider before receiving services. Please refer to the Plan Pa rticipant identification card for the PPO website address.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 (H.R. 3103, 1996) The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted, among other things, to improve portability and continuity of health care coverage. HIPAA also requires that Plan Partic ipants and beneficiaries receive a summary of any change that is a \"Material Reduction in covered services or benefits under a group health plan\" within sixty (60) days after the adoption of the modification or change, unless the Plan Sponsor provides summaries of modifications or changes at regular intervals of ninety (90) days or less.

This requirement applies to Pregnancy expenses of an Employee or a covered Dependent spouse of an Employee. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 (P.L. 103-3) If a Covered Employee ceases active employment due to an Employer-approved Family Medical Leave of Absence in accordance with the requirements of Public Law 103, coverage availability will continue under the same terms and conditions which would have applied had the Employee continued in active employment. Contributions will remain at the same Employer/Employee le vels as were in effect on the date immediately prior to the leave (unless contribu tion levels change for other Employees in the same classification). OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1993 (OBRA 1993: PL 103-66) OBRA 1993 requires that an eligible Dependent Child of an Employee will include a Child who is adopted by the Employee or placed with him for adoption pr ior to age eighteen (18) and a Child for whom the Employee or covered Dependent spouse is required to provide coverage due to a Medical Child Support Order (MCSO) which is determined by the Plan Sponsor to be a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO). A QMCSO will also include a judgment, dec ree or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or through an administrative process established under State law and having the force and effect of law under State law and whic h satisfies the QMCSO requirements .

However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the att ending Provider (i.e., your Physician, Nurse Midwife, or Physician Assistant) , after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier.\" Also, under Federal law, plans and issuers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the forty-eight (48) hour or ninety-six (96) hour stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn t han any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under Federal la w, require that a Physic ian or other health care Provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of st ay of up to forty-eight (48) or ninety-six (96) hours. However, to use certain Providers or Facilities, or to reduce your out-of-pocket costs, you may be required to give notification. For information on notification, contact your Plan Administrator. WOMEN'S HEALTH AND CANCER RIGHTS ACT OF 1998 If you are receiving covered benefits for a mastectomy, you should know that your Plan complies with the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998.

Surgery and reconstruction of the other brea st to produce a symmetrical appearance; and 3. Prostheses and physical complications related to all stages of covered mastectomy, including lymphedema. All applicable benefit provisions still apply, includi ng existing Deductibles, Copays and/or Coinsurance. GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 (\"GINA\") GINA prohibits the group health Plan from: 1. Adjusting premiums or contribution amounts fo r the group as a whole on the basis of Genetic Information. 2. Requesting or requiring an individual or a Family member to undergo a genetic test. However, subject to certain conditions, the Plan may request that an individual voluntarily undergo a genetic test as part of a research study as long as the resu lts are not used for underwriting purposes. 3. Requesting, requiring or purchasing Genetic Inform ation for underwriting purposes (which includes eligibility rules or determinations, computation of pr emium or contribution amounts and other activities related to the creation, renewal or replacement of coverage). The Plan is also prohibited from requesting, requiring or purchasing Genetic Informati on with respect to any individual prior to such individual's enrollment under the Plan or coverage. However, if the Plan obtains Genetic Information incidental to the collection of other inform ation prior to enrollment, it will not be in violation of GINA as long as it is not used for underwriting purposes. GINA allows the group health Plan to obtain and us e the results of genetic tests for purposes of making payment determinations. What is \"Genetic Information\" under GINA? Under GINA, the 11 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 1.

Information obtained through genetic services (t hat is genetic tests, genetic counseling or genetic education) or participation in clinical research that includes genetic services. Genetic Information does not include the sex or age of an individual. MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2008 (MHPAEA) The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act r equires that, if a group health plan provides coverage for mental health conditions or fo r substance use disorders, benefits for such conditions must be provided in the same manner as benefits for any Illness. Also, the Plan may not have separate cost-sharing arrangements that apply only to mental heal th or substance use disorder benefits. PREMIUM ASSISTANCE UNDER MEDICAID AND THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you are eligible for health coverage from your Employer, your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs.

Please contact TMHCC's Transplant Unit toll-f ree at 1-888-449-2377 for benefit information, pre- authorization of transplant services, and transplant network Provider access. Pre-Authorization of Transplant Services Pre-authorization of transplant services is required prior to seeing a transplant Provider for a consult and/or evaluation. Failure to do so could result in reduced benefits. NOTICE - Transplant Network In order to obtain 100% in-network benefits, you must use Providers in a transp lant network approved by and accessed through TMHCC's Transpl ant Unit. Expenses billed by the tr ansplant network Provider that are not covered by the TMHCC policy are subject to this Medical Plan's benefits and the payment terms and conditions of the transplant netwo rk Provider's contracted rates. For more information, contact your Medical Pl an Administrator and/or human resources department. NOTE: The Employer's fully insured Organ Transplant Policy is the Primary payer for Organ, Tissue and Bone Marrow Transplants. In t he event the Employer's Organ Transpl ant Policy does not cover some or all transplant related charges incurred by a Covere d Person due to a pre-existing condition exclusion limitation, this Plan will consider the charges ba sed on benefits below as the Secondary payer.

For Coordination of Benefits when this Plan is secondary, file the prescr iption receipt with the Drug Plan. Call the Prescription Claims Help Desk for a Claim form . See Plan Participant identification card for the phone number. If the pharmacy charge is less than the Generic or Brand Copay, then the actual charge will become the Copay. Generic and Brand Name copayments apply separ ately to each prescription and refill and do not apply to the Calendar Year Deductible. To be covered, Prescription Drugs must be: 1. Purchased from a participating licensed pharmacist; 2. Dispensed to the Covered Person for whom they are prescribed; and 3. Legally prescribed by a Qualified Prescriber. Therapeutic Substitution Therapeutic Substitution is a Physicia n oriented service designed to increas e the utilization of more cost effective products. Substitutes are made for Non-Fo rmulary Brand Name Drugs with either Generic or similar Formulary Brand Name Drugs in the same therapeutic class. 27 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 DEFINITIONS Brand Name Drugs (Tier 2 and Tier 3) Trademark Drugs or substances marketed by the origi nal manufacturer. Tier 2 Drugs are commonly used Brand Name Drugs shown on the Formulary Drug List as \"F ormulary Alternative(s).\" Tier 3 Drugs are Brand Name Drugs listed as \"Non-Formulary\" or not listed. Brand Name Drugs with Generic alternatives are considered \"Non-Formulary.\" Generic Drugs (Tier 1) Drugs or substances which: 1. Are not trademark Dr ugs or substances; and 2. May be legally substituted fo r trademark Drugs or substances. Over the Counter (OTC) Drugs Drugs which do not require a prescription from a Qualified Prescriber, unless otherwise specified. Prescription Drugs Legend Drugs or medicines which are prescribed by a Q ualified Prescriber for the treatment of Illness, Injury or Pregnancy. Qualified Prescriber A licensed Physician, Dentist, or other health care Practitioner who may, in the legal scope of his/her practice, prescribe Drugs or medicines. Specialty Drugs Specialty pharmaceuticals include biotech Drugs prod uced using living organisms which are high cost or injectable Drugs that require heightened patient management and support. Step Therapy Step Therapy is the practice of starting Drug therapy for a medical condition with the most cost-effective and safest Drug available, then progressing to ot her more costly alternatives if necessary. Maximum Allowable Cost The pharmacist substitutes more economically pric ed Generic equivalent Drugs whenever possible unless there is a specific request for a Brand Name by the prescribing Physician or when State law requires no substitution for the Brand Name Drug. Under this program if the prescribing Physician does not specify the Brand Name, but the Covered Person requests the Brand product when there is a Generic substitute available, the Covered Person is required to pay the difference in cost between the Brand and Generic product in addition to the usual Brand Copay (applies to Prescription Card only and Mail Order). Most pharmacists, as a courtesy to the patient, wi ll ask whether a Generic Drug is acceptable to the Covered Person if the Physician has specified \"produc t selection permitted\" on the prescription. If the Physician has specified \"dispense as written,\" no c hoice is given to the patient, and only the applicable Copay will be charged. Drug Review The Plan includes a Drug Review program which is au tomatically administered by the pharmacist through a nationwide computer network that ve rifies the eligibility of each Cove red Person's card and protects the Covered Person from conflicting prescriptions which mi ght prove harmful if taken at the same time. This program also guards against duplication of medications and incorrect dosage levels. Covered and Excluded Drugs The following Covered and Excluded Drug listings are not all inclusive. To find out if a particular Drug is covered, please contact the Prescription Card Service Customer Service phone number listed on the Plan Participant identification card. 28 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 NOTE: Some Drugs may require authorization and may only be covered, and/or covered for certain ages, if Medically Necessary.

Any prescription refilled in excess of the number specified by the Physician, or any refill dispensed after one (1) year from the Physician's original order. NOTE: Drugs excluded from the Prescription Drug Plan are not payable under Major Medical Expense Benefits. A Prescription Drug dispensed by a retail pharmacy, Mail Order Service or Specialty Pharmacy for which a Copay applies is not considered a Claim for benefits under this Plan and, therefore, is not subject to the Plan's Claim Filing Procedures. When Alternative Care and treatment are identified by Case Management as Medically Necessary and approved by the Plan Administrator, and where there is a reasonable expectation of savings to the Plan without sacrificing the quality of care to the patient, the Plan may approve and pay for all or part of the charges not shown as a Covered Prescription Drug in this Plan Document. 29 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 PRESCRIPTION DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW The Prescription Drug benefit does not have unlimit ed coverage. As with all medical and Hospital services, Prescription Drug utilizati on is subject to determinations of Medical Necessity and appropriate use. Drug Utilization Review may be concur rent, retrospective or prospective. Concurrent Drug Utilization Review ge nerally occurs at the time of service and may in clude electronic Claim audits which may help to protect patients from potential Drug interactions or Drug-therapy conflicts or overuse/under use of medications. Retrospective Drug Utilization Review generally involves Claim review and may include communication by the Prescription Drug Plan and/or Utilization Review with the prescr ibing Physician to coordinate care and verify diagnoses and Medical Necessity. It may inclu de a peer review by a Physician of like specialty to the prescribing Physician reviewing the medical and pharmacy records to determine Medical Necessity. Should Medical Necessity not be determined by the peer review Physician, the treating Physician and Plan Participant will be notified and provided with the peer review results. The Plan Participant and Physician will be forwarded information on the appeal process as outlined in this Plan. Prospective Drug Utilization Review may include, am ong other things, Physician or pharmacy assignment in which one Physician and/or one pharmacy is select ed to serve as the coordinator of prescription Drug services and benefits for the eligible Plan Participant. The Plan Participant will be notified in writing of this and will be required to designate a Physician and pharmacy as his/her Providers. 30 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 UTILIZATION REVIEW (UR) PROGRAM The Utilization Review program is designed to help al l Plan Participants receive Medically Necessary and appropriate health care. The Utilization Review Company is listed in the General Information section of this Plan Document. Review for Medical Necessity, Concurrent Review and Retrospective Review are provided by Utilization Review. Services provided will be reviewed to ensure treatment meets Utilization Review's criteria fo r Medical Necessity. Notification must be provided to Utilization Review for all services as detailed below. It is not necessary to contact the Plan or Utilization Review for prior approval of such services. UR NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS Notification is required within forty-eight (48) hours following the services listed below (or the next business day if holiday or weekend admission): Inpatient Hospital/Facility admissions and all Inpatient services including acute care, long- term acute care, high-risk and routine Maternity (routine only if the stay exceeds Federal requirements), Skilled Nursing Facility, Rehabi litation (including Inpa tient and Residential Treatment Center admissions for Mental Di sorders, Chemical Dependency, Drug and Substance Abuse and Inpatient Detoxification); Outpatient Surgical Procedures other than those performed in the Physician's office (penalty waived for all routine colonoscopies); Durable Medical Equipment purchases; Prosthetic purchases; Home Health Care; and Outpatient Hospice.

Utilization Review will notify the Phys ician and/or Hospital/Facility verbally or electronically of the outcome of the Utilization Review. Failure to notify Utilization Review or comp ly with these requirements will result in a 50% benefit reduction penalty for the services listed above. If this non-compliance penalty is imposed for failure to notify Utilization Revi ew, that amount will not be incl uded as part of the Calendar Year Deductible, or Annual Out-of-Pocket Maximum. NOTE: Please refer to the Plan Participant identification card for name and phone number for Utilization Review. While UR Notification of cer tain services is required under the Plan, that notice does not constitute a Cl aim and any such action taken by Utilization Review does not constitute a Benefit Determination.

All Claims are subject to all Plan requirements, such as Medical Necessity, Major Medical Expense Bene fits, Plan Exclusions, Maximum Benefits and Limitations and Eligibility provisions at the time care and services are provided. CONCURRENT REVIEW Following notification of a Hospital/Facility admission, a Concurrent Review of treatment will be conducted by Utilization Review. \"Concurrent Review\" means Utilization Review will monitor the Covered Person's Hospital stay and periodically evaluate the need for continued hospitalization. In addition, Utilization Review may assist with discharge planning and address the health care needs of the patient upon release. This may involve consultation with the Co vered Person's Physician and comparison of clinical information to nationally accepted criteria. 31 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 If a Hospital/Facility confinement continues beyond the number of days approved as part of the Concurrent Review, no benefits will be payable for Room and Board for any unauthorized days of confinement. If a non-compliance penalty is imposed for Hospital confinement in excess of the days approved as part of the Concurrent Review, that amount will never be included as part of the Calendar Year Deductible or Annual Out-of-Pocket Maximum. COORDINATION OF CARE Coordination of Care may be indicated for medical treatment that is Medically Necessary, not Experimental and does not require UR Notification.

It applies when the Plan Participant is also covered by another plan or plans. When more than one coverage exists, one plan (primary plan) normally pays its benefits in full and the other plans (secondary plans) pay a reduced benefit. This Plan ma y pay either its benefits in full or at a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other plan or plans, will not exceed 100% of Allowable Expenses. Only the amount paid by this Plan will be charged against the Plan Benefit Maximums. For organ and tissue transplants, see Coordination With Organ Transplant Policy section. The reduced Benefits payable under this Plan for organ and tiss ue transplants which, when added to the benefits payable by the Organ Transplant Policy, will not exceed be nefits payable under this Plan, if this Plan were primary. The Coordination of Benefits provis ion applies whether or not a Claim is filed under the other plan or plans. If needed, authorization must be given to this Pl an to obtain information as to benefits or services available from the other plan or plans, or to recover overpayments. All benefits contained in the Plan Document are subj ect to this provision except Prescription Drug expenses. EXCESS INSURANCE If at the time of Injury, Illness, Disease or disabili ty there is available, or potentially available, any Coverage (including but not limited to Coverage resu lting from a judgment at law or settlements), the benefits under this Plan shall apply only as an ex cess over such other sources of Coverage. For purposes of this Coordination of Benefits provision, the term \"plan\" as used herein will mean any plan providing benefits or services for medical or dental treatment, and such benefits or services are provided by: 1. Group insurance or any other arrangement for coverage for Covered Persons in a group whether on an insured or uninsured basis, including but not limited to: a. Hospital indemnity benefits; and b. Hospital reimbursement-type pl ans which permit the Covered Person to elect indemnity at the time of Claims; 2. Hospital or medical service organizations on a group basis, group practice and other group pre- payment plans; 3. Hospital or medical service organizations on an i ndividual basis having a provision similar in effect to this provision; 4. A Licensed Health Maintenance Organization (HMO); 5. Any Coverage for students which is sponsored by, or provided through, a school or other educational institution; 6. Any coverage under a governmental program, and any coverage required or provided by any statute; 7. Group automobile insurance; 8. Individual automobile insurance coverage on an automobile leased or owned by the Employer; or 9. Any individual automobile insurance, including No-Fault Automobile Insurance on an individual basis. \"Plan\" will be construed separately with respect to each policy, contract, or other arrangement for benefits or services, and separately with respect to that portion of any such policy, contract, or other arrangement which reserves the right to take the benefits or services of other plans into consideration in determining its benefits and that portion which does not. \"Allowable Expense\" is the Usual and Customary ch arge for any Medically Necessary, Reasonable, eligible item of expense, at leas t a portion of which is covered under this Plan. When some other plan 52 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 provides benefits in the form of services rather th an cash payments, the Reasonable cash value of each service rendered, in the amount that would be payable in accordance with the terms of the Plan, shall be deemed to be the benefit. Benefits payable under any other plan include the benefits that would have been payable had Claim been duly made. In the case of HMO (Health Maint enance Organization) plans, this Pl an will not consider any charges in excess of what an HMO Provider has agreed to accept as payment in full. Further, when an HMO is primary and the Covered Person does not use an HMO Pr ovider, this Plan will not consider as allowable expenses any charges that would have been covered by the HMO had the Covered Person used the services of an HMO Provider. \"Claim Determination Period\" is a Calendar Year, a Pl an Year or that portion of a Calendar or Plan Year during which the Covered Person, for whom Clai m is made, has been covered under this Plan. COORDINATION PROCEDURES Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, be nefits that would be payable under this Plan will be reduced so that the sum of benefits payable under th is Plan and all benefits payable under all other plans will not exceed the total of Allowable Expenses incu rred during any Claim Determination Period with respect to Covered Pe rsons eligible for: 1. Benefits, either as an insured person or Empl oyee or as a Dependent, under any other plan which has no provision similar in effect to this provision. 2. Dependents' benefits under this Plan who are also eligible for benefits: a. As an insured person or Employee under any other plan; or b. As a Dependent Child of an insured person or Employee covered under any other plan. 3. A Covered Person under this Plan who is also elig ible for benefits as an insured person or Employee under any other plan and has been covered continuously for a longer period of time under such other plan. For the purpose of determining the applicability of and for implementing this provision or any provision of similar purpose in any other plan, the Plan Administra tor may, without the consent of or notice to any person, release to or obtain from any other insu rance company or other organization or person any information with respect to any person which the Plan Administrator deems to be necessary for such purposes. Any Covered Person claiming benefits under this Plan will fu rnish to the Plan Administrator such information as may be necessary to implemen t this provision or to determine its applicability. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION Each plan makes its Claim payment according to where it falls in this order, if Medicare is not involved: 1. If a plan contains no provision for Coordination of Benefits, then it pays primar y before all other plans. 2. The plan which covers the Covered Person as an Employee (or named insured) pays primary as though no other plan existed; remaining recognized c harges are paid under a secondary plan which covers the Claimant as a dependent. 3. If the Covered Person is a Dependent Child: a. Whichever parent has a birthday anniversary whic h occurs earlier in the Calendar Year shall be considered to have the primary plan; 53 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 b. If birthday anniversaries are the same, then the plan of the parent who has been covered under his/her plan for the longer period of time will be primary; and c. If the plan with which this Plan is to be co ordinated does not include the requirements shown above, then the plan without such requirements will be primary. 4. If the Covered Person is a Dependent Child and the parents are divorced, then: a. The plan of the parent with custody pays first, unless a court order or decree specifies the other parent to have financial responsibility, in which case that parent's plan would pay first; or b. The plan of a step-parent with whom t he Child lives pays second (if applicable). 5. If the order set out in 1, 2, 3 or 4 above does not apply in a particular case, then the plan which has covered the Covered Person for the lo ngest period of time will pay first. FACILITY OF PAYMENT Whenever payments which should have been made under this Plan in accordance with this provision have been made under any other plan or plans, the Plan Administrator will have the right, exercisable alone and in its sole discretion, to pay to any insu rance company or other organization or person making such other payments any amounts it will determine in or der to satisfy the intent of this provision, and amounts so paid will be deemed paid under this Plan and to the extent of such payments, the Plan Administrator will be fully discharged from liability under this Plan. The benefits that are payable will be charged against any applicable Maximum payment or benefit of this Plan rather than the amount payable in the absence of this provision. RIGHT OF RECOVERY In accordance with the Recovery of Payments provision, whenever paym ents have been made by this Plan with respect to Allowable Expenses in a total amount, at any time, in excess of the Maximum Amount of payment necessary at that ti me to satisfy the intent of this Ar ticle, the Plan shall have the right to recover such payments, to the extent of such ex cess, from any one or more of the following as this Plan shall determine: any person to or with respect to whom such payments were made, or such person's legal representative, any insurance companies, or any other individuals or organizations which the Plan determines are responsible for payment of such A llowable Expenses, and any future benefits payable to the Covered Person or his or her Dependents. Please see the Recovery of Payments provision for more details. COORDINATION WITH ORGAN TRANSPLANT POLICY Covered Persons who are eligible fo r the Employer's fully-insured Orga n Transplant Policy will be entitled to benefits under this Plan only after consideration of transplant expenses by the Employer's Organ Transplant Policy. The Organ Transplant Policy is always the Primary payer and pays before any benefits under this Plan are considered unless the insured per son is eligible for Medicare or is a Dependent covered by another employer's gro up plan. This Plan will always be the Secondary payer unless charges are not covered by the Organ Transplant Policy. This Plan may pay either its benefits in full or a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the Organ Transp lant Policy, will not exceed the benefits payable under this Plan if this Plan were Pr imary. Only the amount paid by this Plan will be charged against the Plan Maximums. This Plan will fully coordinate its benefits, as Secondary payer, against the benefits provided under the above referenced transplant policy. 54 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 COORDINATION WITH MEDICARE Notwithstanding all other provisions of this Plan, Covered Persons who are eligible for Medicare benefits may be entitled to benefits under this Plan which will be co ordinated with Medicare in accordance with the Coordination of Benefits provision of this Plan and subj ect to the rules and regulations as specified by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 as they may be amended from time to time. This Plan is primary to Medicare coverage for all active Em ployees and Dependents (regardless of age) unless Medicare states otherwise for certain medical conditi ons. In the event that this Plan is secondary to Medicare, benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced by benefits that would be payable for the same services under Medicare Parts A and B whether or not the Covered Person is enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. COORDINATION WITH AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COVERAGE The Plan's liability for expenses arising out of an autom obile Accident is based on the type of automobile insurance law enacted by the Covered Person's St ate. Nationally, there are three types of State automobile insurance laws: 1. No-Fault Automobile Insurance laws; 2. Financial responsibility laws; or 3. Other automobile liability insurance laws. COORDINATION WITH AUTOMOBILE NO-FAULT COVERAGE Except as required by law, the Plan is secondary to any No-Fault Automobile co verage. It is not intended to reduce the level of coverage that would otherwise be available through a No-Fault Automobile Insurance policy nor does it intend to be primary in or der to reduce the premiums or cost of No-Fault Automobile coverage. If the Covered Person or his/her covered Dependent incur Covered Charges as a result of an automobile Accident (either as driver, passenger or pedestrian), the amount of Covered C harges that the Plan will pay is limited to: 1. Any Deductible under the automobile coverage; 2. Any Copayment under the automobile coverage; 3. Any expense properly excluded by the automob ile coverage that is a Covered Charge; and 4. Any expense that the Plan is required to pay by law. An individual is considered to be covered under an automobile insurance policy if he/she is either: 1. An owner or principal named insured of the policy; 2. A Family member of a person insured under the policy; or 3. A person who would be eligible for medical expense benefits under an automobile insurance policy if this Plan did not exist. COORDINATION WITH FIN ANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW The Plan is secondary to automobile coverage or to any other party who may be liable for the Covered Person's medical expenses result ing from the automobile Accident. If the Covered Person's State has a \"financial responsibility\" law whic h does not allow the Plan to pay benefits as secondary or which does not allow the Plan to advance payments with the intent of 55 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 subrogating or recovering the payment, the Plan will not pay any benefits related to an automobile Accident for the Covered Person or their Dependents. COORDINATION WITH OTHER AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE If the Covered Person's State does not have a No-F ault Automobile Insurance law or a \"financial responsibility\" law, this Plan is secondary to their autom obile insurance coverage or to any other party who may be liable for the Covered Person's medica l expenses resulting from the automobile Accident. COORDINATION WITH UNDERINSURED/UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE If the Covered Person is involved in an automobile A ccident and, as a result of the Accident, the Plan pays benefits, and if the Covered Person receives a settlement from their underinsured or uninsured motorist policy, the Plan is entitled to receive, from the proceeds of the settlement with the underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage, the ex penses of the Plan. The Plan is not entitled to receive any recovery that is in excess of its expenses. The Plan agrees to payment of benefits prior to the receipt by the Covered Person of any recovery from their underins ured or uninsured motorist policy. The Covered Person agrees to notify the Plan of the existence of a recovery from an underinsured or uninsured motorist policy and further agrees to remit to the Pl an the proceeds of any re covery received from an underinsured or uninsured motorist policy up to the expenditures made by the Plan. Any expenses by the Plan which are in excess of the proceeds received by the underinsured/uninsured motorist policy will be the responsibility of the Plan pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan. 56 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS PAYMENT CONDITION 1. The Plan, in its sole discretion, may elect to conditionally advance pa yment of benefits in those situations where an Injury , sickness, Disease or disability is caus ed in whole or in part by, or results from the acts or omissions of Covered Pers ons, Plan Beneficiaries and/or their Dependents, beneficiaries, estate, heirs, guardian, personal repres entative, or assigns (collectively referred to hereafter in this section as \"Covered Person(s)\") or a third party, where another party may be responsible for expenses arising from an incident a nd/or other funds are available, including but not limited to no-fault, uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, medical payment provisions, third party assets, third party insurance and/or guarantor(s ) of a third party (collectively \"Coverage\"). 2. A Covered Person(s), his/her a ttorney, and/or legal guardian of a minor or incapacitated individual agrees that acceptance of the Plan's conditional paym ent of medical benefits is constructive notice of these provisions in their entirety and agrees to ma intain 100% of the Plan's conditional payment of benefits or the full extent of paym ent from any one or combination of first and third party sources in trust, without disruption except for reimbursement to the Plan or the Plan's assignee. The Plan shall have an equitable lien on any funds re ceived by the Covered Person(s) and/or his/her attorney from any source and said funds shall be held in trust unt il such time as the obligations under this provision are fully satisfied. The Covered Person(s) agrees to include the Plan's name as a co-payee on any and all settlement drafts. Further, by accepting bene fits the Covered Person(s) understands that any recovery obtained pursuant to this section is an as set of the Plan to the extent of the amount of benefits paid by the Plan and that the Covered Pers on shall be a trustee over those Plan assets. 3. In the event a Covered Person(s) settles, recove rs, or is reimbursed by any Coverage, the Covered Person(s) agrees to reimburse the Plan for all benef its paid or that will be paid by the Plan on behalf of the Covered Person(s). If the Covered Person(s) fa ils to reimburse the Plan out of any judgment or settlement received, the Covered Person(s) will be responsible fo r any and all ex penses (fees and costs) associated with the Plan's attempt to recover such money. 4. If there is more than one party responsible for ch arges paid by the Plan, or that may be responsible for charges paid by the Plan, the Plan will not be re quired to select a partic ular party from whom reimbursement is due. Furthermore, in regar ds to an unallocated settlement fund meant to compensate multiple injured parties of which the Covered Person(s) is/are only one or a few, that unallocated settlement fund is considered designated as an \"identifiable\" fund from which the Plan may seek reimbursement. SUBROGATION 1. As a condition to participating in and receiving benefits under this Plan, the Covered Person(s) agrees to assign to the Plan the right to subrogat e and pursue any and all Claims, causes of action or rights that may arise against any person, corporation and/or entity and to any Coverage to which the Covered Person(s) is entitled, regard less of how classified or characteri zed, at the Plan's discretion, if the Covered Person(s) fails to so pursue said rights and/or action. 2. If a Covered Person(s) receives or becomes enti tled to receive benefits, an automatic equitable lien attaches in favor of the Plan to any Claim which any Covered Person(s) may have against any Coverage and/or party causing the sickness or Injury to the extent of such co nditional payment by the Plan plus reasonable costs of collection. The Covered Person is obligated to notify the Plan or it authorized representative of any settlement prior to finalization of the settlement, execution of a release, or receipt of applicable funds. The Covered Person is also obligated to hold any and all funds so received in trust on the Plan's behalf and function as a trustee as it applies to those funds until the Plan's rights described herein are honored and the Plan is reimbursed. 57 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 3. The Plan may, at its discretion, in its own name or in the name of the Covered Person(s) commence a proceeding or pursue a Claim against any party or Co verage for the recovery of all damages to the full extent of the value of any such benefit s or conditional payments advanced by the Plan. 4. If the Covered Person(s) fails to file a Claim or pursue damages against: a. The responsible party, its insurer, or any other source on behalf of that party; b. Any first party insurance through medical payment coverage, personal Injury protection, no-fault coverage, uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage; c. Any policy of insurance from any insurance company or guarantor of a third party; d. Workers' Compensation or other liability insurance company; or e. Any other source, including but not limited to crim e victim restitution funds, any medical, disability or other benefit payments, and school insurance coverages; then the Covered Person(s) authorizes the Plan to pursue, sue, compromise and/or settle any such Claims in the Covered Person(s) and/or the Plan's name and agrees to fully cooperate with the Plan in the prosecution of any such Claims. The Covere d Person(s) assigns all ri ghts to the Plan or its assignee to pursue a Claim and the recovery of a ll expenses from any and a ll sources listed above. RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT 1. The Plan shall be entitled to recover 100% of the benefits paid, without deduction for attorneys' fees and costs or application of the common fund doctrine, make whole doctrine, or any other similar legal theory, without regard to whether the Covered Pers on(s) is fully compensated by his/her recovery from all sources. The Plan shall have an equitable li en which supersedes all common law or statutory rules, doctrines, and laws of any State prohibiting assignment of rights which interferes with or compromises in any way the Plan's equitable lien and right to reimbursement. The obligation to reimburse the Plan in full exists regardless of how the judgment or settlement is classified and whether or not the judgment or settlement specifically designates the recovery or a portion of it as including medical, disability, or other expenses. If the Covered Person(s)' recovery is less than the benefits paid, then the Plan is entitled to be paid all of the recovery achieved. Any funds received by the Covered Person are deemed held in constructive trust and should not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the Covered Person's obligation to reimburse the Plan has been satisfied in accordance with these provisions. The Covered Person is also obligated to hold any and all funds so received in trust on the Plan's behalf and function as a trustee as it applies to those funds until the Plan's rights described herein are honored and the Plan is reimbursed. 2. No court costs, experts' fees, attorneys' fees, f iling fees, or other costs or expenses of litigation may be deducted from the Plan's recovery without the prior, express written consent of the Plan. 3. The Plan's right of subrogati on and reimbursement will not be reduced or affected as a result of any fault or Claim on the part of the Covered Person (s), whether under the do ctrines of causation, comparative fault or contributory negligence, or other similar doctri ne in law. Accordingly, any lien reduction statutes, which attempt to apply such laws and reduce a subrogating Plan's recovery, will not be applicable to the Plan and will not reduce the Plan's reimbursement rights. 4. These rights of subrogation and reimbursement shall apply without regard to whether any separate written acknowledgment of these rights is requir ed by the Plan and signed by the Covered Person(s). 5. This provision shall not limit any other remedi es of the Plan provided by law. These rights of subrogation and reimbursement shall apply without regar d to the location of the event that led to or caused the applicable sickness, Injury, Disease or disability. PARTICIPANT IS A TRUSTEE OVER PLAN ASSETS 1. Any Covered Person who receives benefits and is t herefore subject to the terms of this section is hereby deemed a recipient and holder of Plan assets and is therefore deemed a trustee of the Plan solely as it relates to possession of any funds which may be owed to the Plan as a result of any 58 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 settlement, judgment or recovery through any other means arising from any injury or accident. By virtue of this status, the Covered Person understands that he/she is required to: a. Notify the Plan or its authorized representative of any settlement prior to finalization of the settlement, execution of a release, or receipt of applicable funds; b. Instruct his/her attorney to ensure that the Pl an and/or its authorized representative is included as a payee on all settlement drafts; c. In circumstances where the Covered Person is not represented by an attorney, instruct the insurance company or any third party from whom the Plan Participant obtains a settlement, judgment or other source of coverage to includ e the Plan or its authorized representative as a payee on the settlement draft; and d. Hold any and all funds so received in trust, on the Plan's behalf, and function as a trustee as it applies to those funds, until the Plan's rights described herein are honored and the Plan is reimbursed. 2. To the extent the Covered Person disputes this ob ligation to the Plan under this section, the Covered Person or any of its agents or r epresentatives is also required to hold any/all settlement funds, including the entire settlement if the settlement is less than the Plan's interests, and without reduction in consideration of attorney's fees, for which he/sh e exercises control, in an account segregated from their general accounts or general assets unt il such time as the dispute is resolved. 3. No Covered Person, beneficiary, or the agents or representatives thereof, exer cising control over plan assets and incurring trustee responsibility in accordan ce with this section, will have any authority to accept any reduction of the Plan's interest on the Plan's behalf. EXCESS INSURANCE If at the time of Injury, sickness, Disease or disabi lity there is available, or potentially available any Coverage (including but not limited to Coverage resu lting from a judgment at law or settlements), the benefits under this Plan shall apply only as an excess ov er such other sources of Coverage, except as otherwise provided for under the Pl an's Coordination of Benefits sect ion. The Plan's benefits shall be excess to: 1. The responsible party, its insurer, or any other source on behalf of that party; 2. Any first party insurance through medical paym ent coverage, personal Injury protection, no-fault coverage, uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage; 3. Any policy of insurance from any insurance company or guarantor of a third party; 4. Workers' Compensation or other liability insurance company; or 5. Any other source, including but not limited to crime victim restitution funds, any medical, disability or other benefit payments, and school insurance coverage. SEPARATION OF FUNDS Benefits paid by the Plan, funds recovered by the Covered Person(s ), and funds held in trust over which the Plan has an equitable lien exist separately from the property and estate of the Covered Person(s), such that the death of the Covered Pe rson(s), or filing of bankruptcy by the Covered Person(s), will not affect the Plan's equitable lien, the funds over which the Plan has a lien, or the Plan's right to subrogation and reimbursement. WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS In the event that the Covered Person(s) dies as a result of his/her injuries and a wrongful death or survivor Claim is asserted against a third par ty or any Coverage, the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights shall still apply. 59 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 OBLIGATIONS 1. It is the Covered Person(s) obligation at all time s, both prior to and after payment of medical benefits by the Plan to: a. Cooperate with the Plan, or any representatives of the Plan, in protecting its rights, including discovery, attending depositions, and/or cooperat ing in trial to preserve the Plan's rights; b. Provide the Plan with pertinent information rega rding the sickness, Disease, disability or Injury, including Accident reports, settlement informatio n and any other requested additional information; c. Take such action and execute such documents as the Plan may require to facilitate enforcement of its subrogation and reimbursement rights; d. Do nothing to prejudice the Plan's rights of subrogation and reimbursement; e. Promptly reimburse the Plan when a recove ry through settlement, judgment, award or other payment is received; f. Notify the Plan or its authorized representative of any settlement prior to finalization of the settlement; g. Not settle or release, without the prior consent of the Plan, any Claim to t he extent that the Plan Beneficiary may have against any responsible party or Coverage; h. Instruct his/her attorney to ensure that the Plan and/or its authorized representative is included as a payee on any settlement draft; i. In circumstances where the Covered Person is not represented by an attorney, instruct the insurance company or any third party from wh om the Covered Person obtains a settlement to include the Plan or its autho rized representative as a pay ee on the settlement draft; and j. Make good faith efforts to prevent disburseme nt of settlement funds until such time as any dispute between the Plan and Covered Person over settlement funds is resolved. 2. If the Covered Person(s) and/or his/her attorney fails to reimburse the Plan for all benefits paid or to be paid, as a result of said Injury or condition, out of any proceeds, judgment or settlement received, the Covered Person(s) will be responsible for any and all expenses (whether fees or costs) associated with the Plan's attempt to recove r such money from the Covered Person(s). 3. The Plan's right to reimbursement and/or su brogation is in no way dependent upon the Covered Person(s)' cooperation or adherence to these terms. OFFSET If timely repayment is not made, or the Covered Person (s) and/or his or her attorney fails to comply with any of the requirements of the Plan, the Plan has t he right, in addition to any other lawful means of recovery, to deduct the value of the Covered Person's amount owed to the Plan. To do this, the Plan may refuse payment of any future medical benefits an d any funds or payments due under this Plan on behalf of the Covered Person(s) in an amount equivalent to any outstanding amou nts owed by the Covered Person to the Plan. This provision applies even if the Covered Person has disbursed settlement funds. MINOR STATUS 1. In the event the Covered Person(s) is a minor as that term is defined by applicable law, the minor's parents or court-appointed guardian shall cooperate in any and all actions by the Plan to seek and obtain requisite court approval to bind the minor and his/her estate insofar as these subrogation and reimbursement provisions are concerned. 2. If the minor's parents or court-appointed guardian fail to take such action, the Plan shall have no obligation to advance payment of medical benefits on behalf of the minor. Any court costs or legal fees associated with obtaining such approval shall be paid by the minor's parents or court-appointed guardian. 60 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION The Plan Administrator retains sole, full and final discretionary authority to construe and interpret the language of this provision, to determine all questions of fact and law arising under this provision, and to administer the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights. The Plan Administrator may amend the Plan at any time without notice. SEVERABILITY In the event that any section of this provision is cons idered invalid or illegal for any reason, said invalidity or illegality shall not affect the remaining sections of this provision and Plan. The section shall be fully severable. The Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid or illegal sections had never been inserted in the Plan. 61 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 PROCEDURES FOR CLAIMS AND APPEALS The procedures outlined below must be followed by Claimants to obtain payment of benefits under this Plan. NOTICE AND PROOF OF CLAIM Written notice and proof of an incurred Claim should always be filed with the Claims Administrator as soon as possible. Claims must be filed within twelve (12) months from the date of service to be covered by the Plan. If an individual's coverage under the Plan ceases, all Claims incurred prior to termination of coverage must be filed within twelve (12) months fr om the date of service, or the Claims will not be covered by the Plan. Claims must be filed sooner in certain circumstances: If the Plan is terminated, all Claims incurred prior to the Plan termination must be received within ninety (90) days after the termination or the Claims will not be covered. Any Claims incurred after termination of Plan coverage for any reason are not covered under the Plan. Customarily, there are four types of Claims: Pre-serv ice (Urgent), Pre-service (Non-urgent), Concurrent Care, and Post-service. A \"Pre-service Claim\" is a Claim for a benefit und er the Plan where the Plan conditions receipt of the benefit, in whole or in part, on approval of the benefit in advance of obtaining medical care. Because the Plan does not require Claimants to obt ain approval of a medical service prior to getting treatment on an urgent or non-urgent basis, there are no \"Pre-ser vice Claims.\" The Claimant simply follows the Plan's procedures with respect to notice that is r equired after receipt of treatment, and files the Claim as a Post-service Claim. A \"Concurrent Claim\" arises when the Plan has approved an on-going course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or number of treat ments, and either: (a) the Plan determines that the course of treatment should be reduced or terminated, or (b) the Claimant requests an extension of the course of treatment beyond that which the Plan has approved. Because the Plan does not require Claimants to obtain approval of medical services prior to getting treatment, there is no need to contact Utilization Review to request an exte nsion of a course of treatment. The Claimant simply follows the Plan's procedures with respect to notice that is r equired after receipt of treatment, and files the Claim as a Post-service Claim. A \"Post-service Claim\" is a Claim for a benefit under the Plan after the services have been rendered. A Post-service Claim is considered to be filed when the following information is received by the Claims Administrator with a Form CMS-1500 or Form UB92 or any successor forms: 1. The date of service; 2. The name, address, telephone number, and tax identific ation number of the Provider of the services or supplies; 3. The place where the services were rendered; 4. The diagnosis and procedure codes; 5. The amount of charges (including any PPO re-pricing information); 6. The name of the Plan; 7. The name of the Covered Employee; and 8. The name of the patient. Each Claimant claiming benefits under the Plan shall be responsible for supplying, at such times and in such manner as the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may require, written proof that the expenses were incurred, or that the benefit is covered u nder the Plan. This includes any substantiating 62 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 documentation, Coordination of Benefits information or other informat ion that may be required by the Plan as proof. If the Plan Administrator in its sole discre tion determines that the Cl aimant has not incurred a Covered Expense, or that t he benefit is not covered under the Plan, or if the Claimant fails to furnish such proof as is requested, no benefits shall be payable under the Plan. CLAIMS DETERMINATION The Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant, in acco rdance with the provisions set forth below, of any Adverse Benefit Determination wi thin the following timeframes: If the Claimant has provided all of the informatio n needed to process the Claim in a reasonable period of time, but not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim. This period may be extended by the Plan for up to fifteen (15) days, provided that t he Plan Administrator: (a) determines that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the c ontrol of the Plan, and (b) notifies the Claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial thirty (30) day processing period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time, and the date by which the Plan ex pects to render a decision. If an extension has been requested, then the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant of any Adverse Benefit Determination prior to the end of t he fifteen (15) day extension period. If additional information is requested from the Cl aimant to process the Claim during the initial processing period, then the Claimant will be notified of a determination of benefits prior to the end of the extension period. If additional information is requested from the Claimant during the extension period, then the Claimant will be notified of the determination by a date agreed to by the Plan Administrator and the Claimant. Notice to the Claimant of a rescission of coverage will be provided at least thirty (30) days in advance of the retroactive termination of coverage by the Plan. A Benefit Determination is required to be made within the period of time beginning when a Claim is deemed to be filed in accordance with the procedures of the Plan. For purposes of the Plan's provisions for internal Claims and appeals and external review processes, a \"Claim\" for benefits is defined as a request for a plan benefit made by a Claimant in accordance with a plan's reasonable procedure for filing benefit Claims. A call from a Provider who wants to know if an individual is covered under the Plan, or if a certai n procedure or treatment is a covered expense before the treatment is rendered, is not a \"Claim\" since an actual Claim for benefits is not being filed with the Plan. Likewise, presentation of a prescription to a pharmacy does not constitute a Claim. An \"Adverse Benefit Determination\" is defined as a denial, reduction, or termination of, or a failure to provide or make a payment (in whole or in part) for a benefit, including any such denial, reduction, rescission of coverage, termination, or failure to pr ovide or make a payment for a Claim that is based on: 1. A determination of an individual's eligibility to participate in a plan or health insurance coverage; 2. A determination that a benef it is not a covered benefit; 3. The imposition of a source-of-In jury exclusion, PPO Provider network exclusion, or other limitation on otherwise covered benefits; or 4. A determination that a benefit is Experimental, Investigational, or not Medically Necessary or appropriate. Although it is not a Claim for benefit s, the definition of an adverse benef it determination also includes a rescission of coverage under the Plan. A \"rescission of coverage\" is defined as a cancellation or discontinuance of coverage that has retroactive effect, ex cept to the extent it is attributable to a failure to timely pay required premiums or contri butions towards the cost of coverage. 63 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 NOTICE OF ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION If the initial Benefit Determination is an Adverse Benef it Determination, notification will be sent to the Claimant and will include the following information: 1. Information sufficient to identify the Claim involved, including the date of the service, the health care Provider, the Claim amount (if applicable), and, upon request, the diagnosis code and its corresponding meaning, and the treatment code and its corresponding meaning; 2. The reason or reasons for the Adverse Benefit Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determination, including the denial code and its corresponding meaning, as well as a description of the Plan's standard, if any, used in denying the Claim. In the case of a final internal Adverse Benefit Determination, this description must also include a discussion of the decision; 3. References to the Plan specific provisions on which the Adverse Benefit Determination is based; 4. A description of any additional material or inform ation necessary for the Claima nt to perfect the Claim, and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; 5. A description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the Claimant's right to bring a civil action following an Adverse Benefit Determination on final review; 6. A statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant's Claim; 7. The identity of any medical or vocational expert s consulted in connection wi th a Claim, even if the Plan did not rely upon their advice (o r a statement that the identity of the expert will be provided upon request); 8. If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied on in making the Adverse Benefit Determination, either the specific rule, gui deline, protocol or other similar criterion, or a statement that such information was relied on in ma king the Adverse Benefit Determination, and that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol or other criterion will be provided fr ee of charge on request; and 9. If the Adverse Benefit Determination is based on a medical judgment (such as Medical Necessity or whether the treatment was Experimental), either an ex planation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the Claimant's medical circumstances, or a statement that such explanation will be pr ovided free of charge upon written request. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The Plan Administrator or Claims Administrator has t he right to have the Claimant examined as often as reasonably necessary while a Claim is pending. Benef its are payable under this Plan only if they are Medically Necessary for the Illness or Accidental In jury of the Covered Person. This Plan reserves the right to make a Utilization Review to determine whet her services are Medically Necessary for the proper treatment of the Covered Person. All such information w ill be confidential. CLAIMS AUDIT Once a written Claim for benefits is received, the Claims Administrator, acting on the discretionary authority of the Plan Administrator, may elect to hav e such Claim reviewed or audited for accuracy and reasonableness of charges as part of the adjudication process. This process may include, but may not be limited to, identifying: (a) charges for items/servic es that may not be covered or may not have been 64 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 delivered, (b) duplicate charges and (c) charges beyond the reasonable, necessary and Usual and Customary guidelines as determined by the Plan. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS Plan benefits are payable to the Covered Employee, unles s the Claimant gives written direction, at the time of filing proof of such loss, to pay directly the health care Prov ider rendering such services. Such payment to a health care Provider is subject to the ap proval of the Plan Administrator. If any such benefit remains unpaid at the death of the Covered Employee, if t he Claimant is a minor, or if the Claimant is (in the opinion of the Plan Administrator) legally incapable of giving a valid receipt and discharge for any payment, the Plan Administrator may, at its option, pay such benefits to any one or more of the following relatives of the Claimant: wife, husband, mother, father , Child or Children, brother or brothers, sister or sisters. Such payment will constitute a complete disc harge of the Plan's obligation to the extent of such payment, and the Plan Administrator will not be r equired to follow-up and determine how such paid money was used. APPEAL PROCESS The Plan provides for two (2) levels of appeal following an Adverse Benefit Determination. The Claimant has one hundred eighty (180) days following an initial Ad verse Benefit Determination to file an appeal of that determination, and sixty (60) days following a seco nd Adverse Benefit Determination to file an appeal of that determination.

In deciding an appeal on which the Adverse Benefit Determination was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether a particular tr eatment, Drug, or other item is Experimental, Investigational, or not Medically Necessary or ap propriate, the Claims Administrator or the Plan Administrator, as appropriate depending on the level of appeal, will consult with a health care professional who has appropriate training and exper ience in the field of medicine involving the medical judgment. The health care professional consulted for the appeal will not be the health care professional or a subordinate of the health care pr ofessional consulted in connection with the Adverse Benefit Determination that is the subject of the appeal. 10. Medical or vocational experts whose advice wa s obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with the Adverse Benefit Determination will be identified, ev en if the Plan did not rely upon their advice. 11.

Furnishing Documents in the Event of an Adverse Determination In the case of an Adverse Benefit Determination on review, the Plan Administrator shall provide such access to, and copies of, documents, records, and other information described in the section relating to Notice of Benefit Determination on First Appeal, as appropriate. SECOND APPEAL LEVEL Adverse Decision on First Appeal; Requirements for Second Appeal Upon receipt of notice of the Plan's Adverse Bene fit Determination regarding the first appeal, the Claimant has sixty (60) days to file a second ap peal of the denial of benefits. The Claimant again is entitled to a \"full and fair review\" of any denial made at the first appeal, which means the Claimant has the same rights during the second appeal as he or she had during the first appeal. As with the first appeal, the Claimant's second appeal must be in writing and mu st include all of the items set forth in the section entitled \"Requirements for First Appeal.\" 67 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 Timing of Notification of Benefi t Determination on Second Appeal The Plan shall notify the Claimant of the Plan's Benef it Determination on review within a reasonable period of time, but not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the second appeal. The period of time within which the Plan's determination is required to be made shall begin at the time the second appeal is filed in accordance with the proc edures of this Plan, without regard to whether all information necessary to make the determination accompanies the filing. Manner and Content of Notification of Adve rse Benefit Determination on Second Appeal The same information must be included in the Plan's response to a second appeal as a first appeal, except for: (a) a description of any additional information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the Claim and an explanation of why such information is neede d; and (b) a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to the pr ocedures.

Decision on Second Appeal to be Final If, for any reason, the Claimant does not receive a written response to the appeal within the appropriate time period set forth above, the Claimant may assume that the appeal has been denied. The decision will be final, binding and conclusive, and will be afforded the maximum deference permitted by law. All Claim review procedures provided for in the Plan must be exhausted before any legal action is brought. Any legal action for the recovery of any benefits must be commenced within three (3) years after the Plan's Claim review procedures have been exhausted. Any action with respect to a Fiduciary's Breach of any responsibility, duty or obligation he reunder must be brought within three (3) years after the date of service. Appointment of Authorized Representative A Claimant is permitted to appoint an Authorized Representative to act on his behalf with respect to a benefit Claim or appeal of an Adverse Benefit Determinat ion. An Assignment of B enefits by a Claimant to a Provider will not constitute appointment of that Provider as an Authorized Representative. To appoint such a representative, the Claimant must comple te a form which can be obtained from the Plan Administrator or the Claims Administrator. In the event a Claimant designates an Authorized Representative, all future communications from th e Plan will be with the Authorized Representative, rather than the Claimant, unless the Claimant directs t he Plan Administrator, in writing, to the contrary. EXTERNAL REVIEW OF ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS When the internal appeals procedures have been exhausted, the Claimant may elect to have an additional and final opportunity for a review of an Adve rse Benefit Determination (including a final internal Adverse Benefit Determination) by an independent revi ew organization (IRO). The IRO will be accredited by URAC or a similar nationally re cognized accrediting organization for the purpose of conducting an independent and unbiased review. The request for an external review must be filed by the Claimant within four (4) months following the Claimant's receipt of the notice of Adverse Benefi t Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determination. However, if the Plan fails to strictly adhere to all the requirements of the internal Claims and appeals process with respect to a Claim, the Clai mant will be deemed to have exhausted the internal Claims and appeals process, and the Claimant may in itiate an external review and pursue any available remedies under applicable law, such as judicial review. The Plan's external review process applies to any eligible Adverse Benefit Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determination on appeal, except that a denial, reduction, termination, or a failure to 68 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 provide payment for a benefit based on a determination that a Participant or beneficiary failed to meet the requirements for eligibility under the terms of the Plan is not eligible for the external review process. There are two (2) types of external reviews; standard and expedited. An external review is a standard external review unless the timing required to perform a standard external review involves circumstances that would seriously jeopardize the life or health of t he Claimant or would jeopardize the Claimant's ability to regain maximum function, or if the final internal Adverse Benefit Determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which the Claimant received Emergency services but has not yet been discharged fr om the Facility. In such cases, the Plan will consider the external review to be an expedited review. EXPEDITED EXTERNAL R EVIEW FOR URGENT OR EMERGENCY CARE This Plan does not require a Claimant to obtain prior approval for pre-service urgent care Claims or Emergency care services before getting treatment; therefore, neither the internal appeals nor the external review procedures will apply to these Claims. In an Emergency or urgent care situation, the Claimant should follow instructions from his/her health care Provider, and file the Claim as a post-service Claim. If the post-service Claim results in an Adverse Benefit Determination, the Claimant may file an appeal in accordance with the Plan's provisions for \"Appeal Process,\" wh ich are explained above. Appeals of Claims involving concurrent care will be s ubject to the Plan's provisions for expedited external review, as explained below. PROCEDURES FOR INITIATION OF AN EXTERNAL REVIEW Standard External Review A request for an external review must include the same information that is required for an internal appeal, listed above in the sect ion, \"Appeal Process.\" Once the request for a standard external review is filed, the Plan will have five (5) business days to do a preliminary review of the request to determine whether it is eligible and whether all of the information and forms required to process the external review have been provided. Within one (1) business day following completion of the preliminary review, the Plan will notify the Claimant in writing whether the request is eligible for external review. If the request is complete but is not eligible fo r external review, the notic e will contain an explanation of the reason that the request is ineligible. If the request is incomplete, the notice will describe the information or material s needed to make the request complete. The Claimant must submit the information or materials needed within forty-eight (48) hours following receip t of the notice, or the expiration of t he original four (4) month filing period, whichever is later. An eligible request which is complete and timely filed will be assigned to an independent review organization (IRO) by the Plan. The Plan will have ar rangements to access at least three (3) accredited IROs to which external reviews will be assigned on a random or rotated basis to ensure an independent and unbiased review. The assigned IRO will notify the Clai mant in writing of the request's eligibility and ac ceptance for external review. This notice will include a statement that the Clai mant may submit to the IRO, in writing and within ten (10) business days following receipt of the notic e, any additional information that the IRO must consider when conducting the external review. Within five (5) business days after the date of as signment of the IRO, the Plan must provide to the assigned IRO the documents and any informati on considered in making the Adverse Benefit 69 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determ ination. Failure by the Plan to timely provide the documents and information will not delay the conduct of the external review, and the IRO may decide to reverse the Adverse Benefit Determination or final inte rnal Adverse Benefit Determination. In this case, the IRO will notify the Plan and the Claimant within one (1) business day following the decision to reverse the determination. The assigned IRO will forward any information which is submitted by the Claimant to the Plan, and the Plan may reconsider its Adverse Benefit Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determination; however, reconsideration by the Plan will not delay the external review. If the Plan decides to reverse its Adverse Benefit Determination or final internal Ad verse Benefit Determination, it may terminate the external review and notify the IRO and the Claim ant within one (1) business day of the decision. The IRO will provide written notice to the Claimant and the Plan of the fi nal external review decision within forty-five (45) days following receipt of the request for review. The notice will contain: A general description of the reason for the request fo r external review, including information sufficient to identify the Claim (including the date or dates of service, the health care Provider, the Claim amount (if applicable), and, upon request, the di agnosis code and its corresponding meaning, the treatment code and its corresponding meaning, and the reason for the previous denial; The date the IRO received the request for external review and the date on which it made the decision; References to the evidence or documentation, including the specific coverage provisions and evidence-based standards, considered in reaching its decision; A discussion of the principal re ason or reasons for its decision, including the rationale for its decision and the evidence-based standards that were relied on in making the decision; A statement that the determinatio n is binding except to the ext ent that other remedies may be available under State or Federal law to either the group health plan or to the Claimant; A statement that judicial review may be available to the Claimant; and Current contact information, including a phone number, for any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman established under PHS Act section 2793. See Appendix I for additional information. Expedited External Review A final internal Adverse Benefit Determination concerning an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which the Cl aimant received Emergency services but has not yet been discharged from the Facility will be considered for an expedited external review. These are considered to be pre-service non-urgent care Claims and concurrent Claims. The procedures that apply to standard external review s will apply to expedited external reviews, except that: The preliminary review of the request to determine whether it is eligible and whether all of the information and forms required to process the exte rnal review have been provided must be conducted immediately, and the Plan must immediately notify th e Claimant regarding the eligibility determination; Upon a determination that a request is eligible for external review following the preliminary review, the Plan will immediately assign an IRO pursuant to the requirements set forth for standard external reviews; The Plan must provide or transmit all necessary documents and information considered in making the Adverse Benefit Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determination to the assigned IRO electronically, by phone, facsimile or any other available expeditious method; and 70 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 The IRO must provide notice of the final external review decision as expeditiously as the Claimant's medical condition or circumstances require, but in no event more than seventy-two (72) hours after the IRO received the request for an expedited external review. If the notice is not in writing, the assigned IRO must provide written confirmation of the decision to the Claimant and the Plan within forty-eight (48) hours following the notice. DECISION FOLLOWING AN EXTERNAL REVIEW Upon receipt of a notice from the IRO reversing the decision of an Adverse Benefit Determination or final internal Adverse Benefit Determination, the Plan will immediately provide coverage or payment for the Claim. An external review decision is binding on the Plan as well as the Claimant, except to the extent other remedies are available under State or Federal law. RECOVERY OF PAYMENTS Occasionally, benefits are paid more than once, are paid based upon improper billing or a misstatement in a proof of loss or enrollment information, are not paid according to the Plan's terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, or should otherwise not ha ve been paid by the Plan. As such, this Plan may pay benefits that are later found to be greater than the Ma ximum Allowable Charge. In this case, this Plan may recover the amount of the overpay ment from the source to which it was paid, primary payers, or from the party on whose behalf the charge(s) were paid. As such, whenever the Plan pays benefits exceeding the amount of benefits payable under the terms of the Plan, the Plan Administrator has the right to recover any such erroneous payment directly from the person or entity who received such payment and/or from other payers and/or the Covered Pers on or Dependent on whose behalf such payment was made. A Covered Person, Dependent, Provider, another benefit plan, insurer, or any other person or entity who receives a payment exceeding the am ount of benefits payable under the terms of the Plan or on whose behalf such payment was made, shall return or refund the amount of such erroneous payment to the Plan within thirty (30) days of discovery or demand. T he Plan Administrator shall have no obligation to secure payment for the expense for whic h the erroneous payment was made or to which it was applied. The person or entity receiving an erroneous payment may not apply such payment to another expense. The Plan Administrator shall have the sole discretion to choose who w ill repay the Plan fo r an erroneous payment and whether such payment shall be reimbu rsed in a lump sum. When a Covered Person or other entity does not comply with the provisions of this section, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to deny payment of any Claims for benefits by the Covered Person and to deny or reduce future benefits payable (including payment of future benefits for other Injuries or Illnesses) under the Plan by the amount due as reimbursement to the Plan. The Plan Administrator may also, in its sole discretion, deny or reduce future benefits (includi ng future benefits for other Injuries or Illnesses) under any other group benefits plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor. The reductions will equal the amount of the required reimbursement. Providers and any other person or ent ity accepting payment from the Plan or to whom a right to benefits has been assigned, in consideration of services rend ered, payments and/or rights, agree to be bound by the terms of this Plan and agree to submit Claims for reimbursement in strict accordance with their State's health care practice acts, ICD-10 or CPT standards, Medicare guidelines, HCPCS standards, or other standards approved by the Plan Administrator or insurer. Any payments made on Claims for reimbursement not in accordance with the above provisions shall be repaid to the Plan within thirty (30) days of discovery or demand or incur prejudgment inte rest of 1.5% per month.

Pursuant to a Claim for which benefits are recove rable under any policy or act of law providing for coverage for occupational Injury or Disease to th e extent that such benefit s are recovered. This provision (6) shall not be deemed to require the Plan to pay benefits under this Plan in any such instance. The deduction may be made against any Claim for benefits under this Plan by a Covered Person or by any of his covered Dependents if su ch payment is made with respect to the Covered Person or any person covered or asserting coverage as a Dependent of the Covered Person. If the Plan seeks to recoup funds from a Provider due to a Claim being made in error, a Claim being fraudulent on the part of the Provider, and/or the Claim is the result of the Provider's misstatement, said Provider shall, as part of its Assignment of Benefits from th e Plan, abstain from billing the Covered Person for any outstanding amount(s). 72 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 GENERAL PROVISIONS RIGHT OF RECOVERY In accordance with the Recovery of Payments provision, whenever paym ents have been made by this Plan in a total amount, at any time, in excess of the Maximum Amount of benefits payable under this Plan, the Plan shall have the right to recover such pa yments, to the extent of such excess, from any one or more of the following as this Plan shall determine: any person to or with respect to whom such payments were made, or such person's legal repres entative, any insurance companies, or any other individuals or organizations which the Plan determines are responsible for payment of such amount, and any future benefits payable to the Covered Person or his or her Dependents.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION NOT AFFECTED This Plan is not in lieu of and does not affect any requirement for coverage by Workers' Compensation Insurance or, where permitted and applicable, any other alternative form of Workers' Compensation benefits. CONFORMITY WITH LAW This Plan shall be deemed to automatically be ame nded to conform as required by any applicable law, regulation or the order or judgment of a court of com petent jurisdiction governing pr ovisions of this Plan, including, but not limited to, stated maximums, exclus ions or limitations.

The Plan will use the following rules related to Children placed for adoption, QMCSOs and NMSNs. This Plan will provide benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any QMCSO or NMSN. A QMCSO is a Medical Child Support Order of a cour t or of certain administrative agencies that creates, recognizes or assigns to a Child of a Plan Participant the right to receive health benefit coverage under the Plan. A NMSN is an order issued by a State agency requiring the Plan to cover a Child. To be qualified, a Medical Child Support Order must comp ly with State and Federal laws and contain the following: 1. The name and last known mailing address (if any) of both the Plan Participant and the Child covered under the order except that, to t he extent provided in the order, the name and mailing address of an official of a State or a political subdivision ther eof may be substituted for the mailing address of any such Alternate Recipient. 2. A reasonable description of the type of coverage to be provided by the Plan for each Child (or the manner in which the type of coverage will be determined). 3. The period of coverage to which the order applies. In addition, a QMCSO or NMSN will generally not be cons idered qualified if it requires the Plan to provide certain benefits or options which ar e not otherwise provided by the Plan. The Plan Administrator will notify the Plan Participant of the receipt of a Medical Child Support Order and the procedures for determining whether it is a Qualified Medical Child Support Order or a NMSN. The Plan Administrator will then determine within a reasonable period of time whether the Medical Child Support Order is a QMCSO or NMSN. Plan Participants may request and receive, free of charge, a copy of Plan procedures relating to QMCSOs and NMSNs. If an Employee is not enrolled in the Plan, and the Employee would otherwise be eligible for coverage, the Plan must enroll the Eligible Employee and the Ch ild(ren) and the Eligible Employee covered by the QMCSO. This Plan will also provide benefits to Dependent Children placed for adoption on the same basis as natural Children even prior to t he adoption becoming final. A Child will be considered \"Placed for Adoption\" with a Plan Participant if the Plan Participant has assumed a legal obligation for total or partial support of the Child in anticipation of adoption of the Ch ild. For this reason, if a Child is placed with a Plan Participant for adoption by an adoption agency or other entity, the Plan Participant must provide to the Plan Administrator documentation (e.g., signed court or der) that the adoption agen cy or other entity had legal custody of the Child on the date that the Child was placed with the Plan Participant for adoption. The Plan Administrator will determine within a reasonable period of time whether a Child has been \"Placed for Adoption.\" The Plan Administrator has final, discretionary authority to determine: (1) whether a Medical Child Support Order qualifies as a QMCSO or NMSN; and (2 ) whether a Child has been \"Placed for Adoption.\" 77 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE EMPLOYEE EFFECTIVE DATE An Eligible Employee, properly enrolled in the Plan, will be referr ed to as a \"Covered Employee.\" Each Employee's coverage under the Plan shall become effective on the first day of the month concurrent with or following the date the Employee completes the eligibility requirements of the Plan provided written or electronic application for coverage is made on or before or within thirty ( 30) days after the date the Employee eligibility requirements are met.

In order to become covered under the Plan, Eligible Dependents must be identified on an Enrollment and/or Change form. 2. If the Employee makes a request for Dependent cove rage on or before or within thirty (30) days immediately following his/her own effective date, t hen each Eligible Dependent will become effective on the same date the Employee's coverage is effective. 3. If an Employee makes a request to add a Dependent Child to the Plan in accordance with a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO), the effectiv e date of coverage for the Dependent Child will be the date specified in the QMCSO. Child(ren) covere d by QMCSOs may be enrolled in this Plan if the Employee would otherwise be eligible for coverage regardless of whether t he Employee is currently enrolled. The Plan must enroll the Child(ren) and the Eligible Employee covered by the Notice without any enrollment restrictions (i.e., t hey will not be considered Late Enrollees). 4. If the Covered Employee makes a request to ad d a Dependent spouse and/or Child who previously was not eligible for the Plan within thirty (30) day s of such Dependent becoming entitled to Special Enrollment rights or following a Status Change, the effective date of coverage is the date the individual meets the Plan's definition of Dependent. LATE ENROLLEE An Employee or Dependent who enrolls in the Plan mo re than thirty (30) days after the date of his/her initial eligibility is considered a Lat e Enrollee unless he/she qualifies for a Special Enrollment or there is a Status Change. 78 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 EMPLOYEE AND DEPENDENT SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS The Plan provides Special Enrollment rights and Special Enrollment Periods for Employees and their Dependents who previously declined to enroll in the Plan and who remain eligible for the Plan.

Special Enrollment in this Plan must be requested within thirty (30) days after the dat e eligibility for other coverage ends. If an individual enrolls during a Special Enrollment Period, he/she is considered a Sp ecial Enrollee; he/she will not be considered a Late Enrollee.

If an individual enrolls during a Special Enrollment Period, he/she is considered a S pecial Enrollee; he/she will not be considered a Late Enrollee. 80 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 ANNUAL OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD FOR THE EMPLOYEE MEDICAL PLAN The Annual Open Enrollment Period for the Plan is a period of time designated by the Employer each year for coverage to become effective January 1, provi ded written or electronic application for coverage is made on or before the end of the Annual Open Enrollment Period or within thirty (30) days after the Annual Open Enrollment Period. All Eligible Employee s and Dependents not currently enrolled in the Plan may do so during the Annual Open Enrollment Period. All Covered Employees are required to re-enroll in the Plan. If application to enroll is made more than thirty (30) days after the Annual Open Enrollment Period ends, the Employee and/or Dependent must wait until the Plan's next Open Enrollment Period to enroll. LATE ENROLLEE A Late Enrollee is an Employee or Dependent who gave up his/her initial opportunity to enroll in the Plan. A Late Enrollee can only enroll once a year duri ng the Annual Open Enrollment Period for the Plan unless he/she qualifies for a Special Enrollment or if there is a Status Change. EMPLOYEE LATE ENROLLEE An Employee is considered a Late Enrollee if: 1. He/she makes written or electronic application for coverage under the Plan more than thirty (30) days after the date of his/her initial eligibility; 2. He/she is not eligible for a Special Enrollment or enrollment as a result of a Status Change; or 3. He/she failed to enroll by the end of a Special En rollment Period or enrollment period for a Status Change. Effective Date of Coverage for Employee Late Enrollees The effective date of coverage for an Employee who is a Late Enrollee will be the effective date of the Annual Open Enrollment for the Plan. DEPENDENT LATE ENROLLEE A Dependent is considered a Late Enrollee if: 1. The Covered Employee makes written or electronic application for Dependent coverage after the thirty (30) day period immediately following his/ her effective date of coverage and the Dependent was not enrolled by the end of a Special Enrollment Period; 2.

Effective Date of Coverage for Dependent Late Enrollees The effective date of coverage for each Dependent who is a Late Enrollee will be the effective date of the Annual Open Enrollment for the Plan. 81 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 The Eligibility and Effective Date pr ovisions are subject to the requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) and the Heal th Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as they may be amended. ANNUAL ELECTION PERIOD FOR THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN The Annual Election Period for the Employee Health Plan is the same as the Annual Election for the Section 125 Plan. This is a period of time designated by the Employer each year for coverage to become effective January 1of the next year. All eligible Employees and Dependents not currently enrolled in the Plan may do so during the Annual Election Period for the Section 125 Plan. 82 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 COVERAGE CHANGES FOR EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE SECTION 125 PLAN Contributions to the Plan are made on a \"Salary R eduction\" basis under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This allows premium contributions to be withheld from the Employee's paycheck on a \"pre-tax\" basis before any Federal Income Tax or FICA taxes are calculated. The Annual Election Period for the Section 125 Plan is the same as the Annual Open Enrollment Period for the Employee Health Plan. It is a period of time designated by the Employer each year for an effective date of January 1. Once an election is made to par ticipate, this election can only be changed during the next year's Annual Open Enrollment Period for the Plan. A coverage change is allowed in the Medical Plan if there is a change in status due to certain events including, but not limited to, any of the following: Status Changes Marriage Divorce or legal separation (in thos e States recognizing legal separation) Birth or adoption of a Child Death of spouse or Child Commencement of spouse's or Dependent's employment Termination of spouse's or Dependent's employment Open enrollment for spouse's/ Dependent's Employer plan Significant cost or coverage changes for Employee, spouse or Dependent Change from part-time to Full-time Employment (or vice-versa)/reduction or increase in hours Unpaid Leave of Absence Change in the residence or worksite Dependent satisfies or ceases to satisfy the eligibility requirements for coverage Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) Entitlement to or loss of elig ibility for Medicare or Medicaid Entitlement to or loss of eligibility for a St ate Children's Health In surance Program (CHIP) Open enrollment of a Marketplace Qualified Health Plan (QHP) as outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) An election change may be made only if a recognized Status Change for cafeteria plans will result in the gain or loss of eligibility for coverage of the Employee, the Employee's spouse or Dependent. A written request for addition or deletion of coverage due to a Status Change must be made within thirty (30) days of that change or the ex ception will not apply. However, a request for addition or deletion of coverage due to a change in eligibility under Medicaid or a State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) must be made within sixty (60) days of that change. Tag Along Rule: If, due to a Status Change, an Eligible Employee enrolls in health coverage or a Covered Employee elects to increase health coverage, at that time, the Eligible Employee or the Covered Employee may also enroll his/her spouse and/or Elig ible Dependents who were not previously covered for health care regardless of whether such indi viduals personally experienced the Status Change. Effective Date of Covera ge Following Status Change Most Status Changes qualify for Special En rollment. See the Employee and Dependent Special Enrollment Periods section. If there is a Status Change which does not qualify for a Special Enrollment Period as outlined in the Employee and Dependent Special Enrollment Periods, t he effective date of coverage under the Medical Plan will be the date of the Status Change. 83 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 TERMINATION OF COVERAGE EMPLOYEE COVERAGE TERMINATION An Employee's coverage shall automatically terminat e at midnight on the earliest of the following dates: 1.

A Covered Empl oyee or a covered Dependent is responsible for notifying the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after the date of certain Qualifying Events (including loss of coverage due to divorce, legal separation, or a Dependent Child ceasing to qualify as a Dependent). A change form may be obtained from the Empl oyer. Failure to provide such notice will result in loss of eligibility to elect COBRA coverage. See Continuation of Group Health Coverage (COBRA) section for further information. NOTE: The Termination provisions are subject to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COB RA), Public Law 99-272 and the Employer's Section 125 Plan. 84 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 COVERAGE DURING LEAVE OF ABSENCE If, after Paid Time Off (PTO), ac tive work ceases due to an Employ er approved Leave of Absence or an approved Leave of Absence subject to the Family and Medical Leave Ac t (FMLA), an approved leave as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Dis abilities Act (ADA) or approved leave required by applicable State law (Family, Medical, Disability and/or other temporary leave), the Plan Administrator may, while the Plan is in force, continue the Empl oyee's coverage (Employee and Dependent) during the period after cessation of active work due to: 1. Approved Family and Medical Leave (FMLA), but not to exceed a period of twelve (12) weeks (or twenty-six (26) weeks in the case of a Family se rvice member medical leave) provided any required Employee contributions are made; or 2. Approved leave as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended, for the timeframe approved by the Employer when leave is the only available accommodation; or 3. Approved leave required by applicable State law (F amily, Medical, Disability and/or other temporary leave) for up to the minimum amount of time required by such State law provided any required Employee contributions are made; or 4. Employers who are granted a formal leave of abs ence for any reason may continue coverage under the Plan for up to one month starting with the date the leave begins. The Employer will not continue to pay his portion of the premium amount for the Employee. The Employee will be responsible for the entire premium during this leave. Upon the Employee's return to active employment following a leave of absence, coverage under this Plan will begin immediately with no waiting period. The above Employer approved Leave of Absence is concurrent with, and is not in addition to, the twelve (12) week (or twenty-six (26) weeks in the case of a Family service member medical leave) approved Family and Medical Leave (FMLA), an approved leave as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the minimum amount of time required by an approved leave required by applicable State law (Family, Medical, Disab ility and/or other temporary leave). ACTIVE DUTY IN THE ARMED FORCES If a Covered Employee and/or his/her covered Dependent(s) would lose Plan coverage as a result of the Employee being called for active duty in the armed forc es of the United States, such a reduction in hours (or termination of employment) would be a COBRA Qualifying Event. Any coverage mandated under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), as amended by the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, will r un concurrently with federally mandated COBRA coverage. For additional information, see the sectio ns entitled Continuation of Group Health Coverage (COBRA) and Continuation of Coverage under USERRA. 85 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 REHIRES / REINSTATEMENT OF COVERAGE A terminated Employee who is rehired will be treated as a new hire and will be required to satisfy all Eligibility and enrollment requirements of the Plan only if the Employee was not credited with an Hour of Service with the Employer (or any member of the controlled or affiliated gr oup) for a period of at least thirteen (13) consecutive weeks immediately prec eding the date of rehire or, if less, a period of consecutive weeks that exceeds the greater of (a) f our (4) weeks, or (b) the number of weeks of the Employee's immediately preceding Period of Employment. If a terminated Employee is rehired by the Employer within a thirteen (13) week period immediately following the date of such termination, the Employee shall become eligible for reinstatement of coverage on the first day of the month concurrent with or following the date the Employee resumes employment, and the Employee's Dependents shall also become eligible for reinstatement on that date. However, re- enrollment is not automatic and the Employee must enro ll or waive enrollment within thirty (30) days of the rehire employment date. The reinstated Empl oyee and the Employee's Dependents will not be subject to the Waiting Period for new Employees. NOTE: An exception applies for a terminated Employ ee on COBRA who is rehired and returns to work after expiration of the above reinstatement period. Coverage will be continuous from the first day of the month following the date he/she resume s employment with no Waiting Period applied. An Employee whose coverage would terminate due to ac tive duty in the Uniformed Services of the United States, and who qualifies for military leave u nder the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), will be reinstated on the date he/sh e resumes employment with the Employer provided that such resumption of employm ent is within the time period specified in USERRA. The reinstatement procedures following a USERRA m ilitary leave are subject to the requirements of USERRA. 86 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE (FMLA) All Employers employing at least fifty (50) workers within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of the work place must provide eligible Employees with up to twelve (12) weeks or twenty-six (26) weeks, in the case of #5 below, of job-protected Leave of Absence during a twelve (12) month period, as determined by the Employer, generally for any of the following situations: 1. The birth or adoption of a Child; 2. The serious Illness of the Em ployee's spouse, Child, or parent; 3. The Employee's own disabling serious Illness; 4. The qualifying exigency (as defined by the Secr etary of Labor) of the Employee's spouse, Child or parent service member who is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty; or 5. The serious Illness or Injury of the Employee's spouse, Child, parent or next of kin service member whose Illness or Injury was incurred in the line of duty that may render the member unfit to perform the duties of the service member's office, grade, rank or rating. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES: Employees who have been employ ed by the Employer for at least twelve (12) months and who have worked at least 1,250 hours for the Employer during the previous twelve (12) months are eligible for Family and Medical Leave. BENEFIT REQUIREMENT: The Employer must provi de the same group health plan during the leave under the same level of contribution required during active employment. RETURN TO EMPLOYMENT: Although the leave is unpai d, the Employee must be guaranteed return to the same or equivalent position with equivalent Em ployee benefits, pay, and other terms of employment. (Note: An Employer may deny job restoration under the leave law to Employees who are in the highest paid 10% of Employees.) Employee benefits may include: If an Employee chooses not to retain Plan coverage during Family and Medical Leave, Plan coverage may be restored upon return to active service as an Eligible Employee. Employees must be treated as though no service interruption had occurred. This mean s that new Waiting Periods will not be applied. Any period of coverage provided for disability may r un concurrently with Family and Medical Leave. The above listing of Employee benefits may or may not be applicable to every employer's plan of benefits. This section is intended as a summary of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), effective August 5, 1993, as amended, not as a complete interpretation of the law.

COBRA coverage is the same health coverage that applies to Covered Employees and covered Dependents under the Plan. However, the individual el ecting COBRA coverage must pay the full cost of the coverage plus an administrative fee of 2%. The length of time COBRA coverage can be continued is based upon the date of and the applicable Qualifying Event as described below: Maximum Qualified Coverage Beneficiary Qualifying Event Period Covered Employee and/or Loss of coverage due to termination 18 months Covered Dependent of employment (other than for gross misconduct) or reduction in hours Disabled Covered Employee Loss of coverage due to termination 29 months* and/or Disabled Covered of employment (other than for gross Dependent and each Qualified misconduct) or reduction in hours Beneficiary who is not disabled* Covered Dependent Loss of coverage due to divorce, 36 months legal separation or death of Employee Covered Dependent Loss of coverage due to Dependent Child 36 months losing eligibility as a Dependent Child Covered Dependent Loss of coverage due to Covered 36 months Employee's entitlement to Medicare (See Special Medicare Entitlement Rule section.) QUALIFIED BENEFICIARY A Qualified Beneficiary also includes a Child born to or placed for adoption with a former covered Employee/Qualified Beneficiary during the period of COBRA coverage. Newborns and adopted Children of former Covered Employees/Qualified Beneficiari es have independent COBRA rights and can remain on the Plan even if the former covered Empl oyee/Qualified Beneficiary drops coverage. *SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY If a Covered Employee or a covered Dependent is det ermined to be disabled, as defined in the Social Security Act, on the date of the termination of employment or reduction in hours, or at any time during the first sixty (60) days of COBRA Continuation Covera ge, the disabled person may be entitled to continue COBRA coverage for up to twenty-nine (29) months from the date of terminat ion of employment or reduction in hours, provided the Social Security Admi nistration determines, during the initial eighteen (18) month coverage period, that the individual is disabled . To qualify for the eleven (11) month extension of the maximum coverage period, the disabled person must provide the Plan Administrator with a copy of the Social Security Administration determination letter within sixty (60) days of receipt of same, and not later than the expiration of the original ei ghteen (18) month initial coverage period. 88 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 The cost of COBRA coverage for an individual entitled to extended coverage due to Social Security Disability for the period after the en d of the eighteen (18) month COBRA coverage period will increase to 150% of the full cost for active participants. SECONDARY QUALIFYING EVENTS If COBRA coverage is elected by a covered Dep endent based on the Covered Employee's loss of coverage due to termination of employment or redu ction in hours and a second Qualifying Event (divorce, legal separation, death or a Depende nt Child losing eligibility as a Dependent Child) occurs during the eighteen (18) month COBRA coverage period, t he covered Dependent's maximum COBRA coverage period will begin on the date of the first Qualifying Ev ent and continue for a thirty-six (36) month period. For example: If a covered Employee terminates em ployment on December 31, 2015, the Employee's covered Dependent elects COBRA coverage, and the former Employee dies before July 1, 2017 (that is prior to the end of the original eighteen (18) month COBRA coverage period), the maximum COBRA coverage period for the Dependent who elected COBRA coverage is extended until December 31, 2018. SPECIAL MEDICARE ENTITLEMENT RULE Entitlement to Medicare is not considered a tradi tional secondary Qualifying Event for a covered Dependent; however, Medicare entitlement does prov ide potentially longer periods of continuation coverage to certain Qualified Beneficiaries based on the sequence of events. If a Covered Employee becomes entitled to Medicare, but the Employee is still a full-time active Employee, this event is not a COBRA Qualifying Event since Medicare entitlement al one does not cause a loss of coverage. If the Covered Employee voluntarily terminates employment after the Medicare entitlement date, the loss of coverage triggers a potential eighteen (18) mont h COBRA continuation period for all Qualified Beneficiaries. While the Covered Employee is only entitled to eighteen (18) months of COBRA Continuation Coverage, the other Qualified Beneficiar ies (spouse and/or Depend ent Children) are entitled to eighteen (18) months or thirty-six (36) months, measured from the date of the Employee's Medicare entitlement, whichever is greater. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES COBRA coverage is not automatic upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Event. COBRA coverage must be elected as described below. In addition, a covered Employee or a covered Dependent is responsible for notifying the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after the date of the Qualifying Event if the Qualifying Event is the loss of coverage due to divorce, legal separation, or a Dependent Child losing eligibility as a Dependent Child. A change form may be obtained from the Employer. Failure to provide such notice wi ll result in loss of eligibility to elect COBRA coverage. A Qualified Beneficiary must elect COBRA coverage no later than sixty (60) days after the date the eligible individual is sent an election form descri bing his/her right to elect continuation coverage (COBRA Election Period). If a Qualified Beneficiary elects coverage during the sixty (60) day COBRA Election Period, coverage is continuous from the time coverage would otherwise have been lost. A properly completed election form must be returned to the Pl an Administrator, signed and dated, by the end of the COBRA Election Period. If premium payment is not sent with the election fo rm, initial premium payment for COBRA coverage must be received no later than forty-five (45) days after the date COBRA coverage was elected. Initial payment must cover the retroactive monthly coverage period beginning with the date of loss of coverage. Coverage will not become effective until initial premium payment is received. Coverage will remain in effect if subsequent premiums are paid no later than thirty (30) days after the due dates of such payments. Failure to pay premiums within the ti me periods specified will result in termination of COBRA coverage. Once continuation is terminated, the coverage cannot be 89 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 reinstated. If timely payments of the premium are made to th e Plan in an amount that is not significantly less than the amount the Plan requires to be paid for a period of coverage, then the amount paid is deemed to satisfy the Plan's requirement for the amount that must be paid for continuation coverage, unless the Plan notifies the Qualified Beneficiary of the amount of the deficiency and grants a reasonable period of time (30 days) for payment of the deficiency to be made. For purposes of this section an amount not significantly less than the amount the Plan requi res to be paid shall be defined as not more than the lesser of $50 or 10% of the required payment amount. TERMINATION OF COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE COBRA coverage, for a Qualified Beneficiary who el ects such coverage, will terminate prior to the completion of the eighteen (18) month, twenty-nine (29) month, or thirty-six (36) month period previously described upon one of the following occurrences: 1. The Qualified Beneficiary becomes covered by another group health plan after the date of COBRA election; 2. Required contributions are not paid by or on behal f of the Qualified Beneficiary in a timely manner; 3. The Qualified Beneficiary becomes entitled to benefits under Medicare after the date of COBRA election; 4. The Qualified Beneficiary makes a reques t, in writing, to terminate coverage; or 5. The Plan Sponsor ceases to provide any group h ealth plan to any similarly situated Employee. NEW DEPENDENTS If during the eighteen (18) months, twenty-nine (29) mont hs or thirty-six (36) m onths, if applicable, of COBRA coverage, a Qualified Beneficiary acquires new Dependents (such as through marriage), the new Dependent(s) may be added to the coverage according to the provisions of the Plan. However, the new Dependents do not gain the status of a Qualified Benef iciary and will lose coverage if the Qualified Beneficiary who added them to the Plan loses coverage. An exception to this is a Child who is born to, or a Child who is placed for adoption with, the covered Employee Qualified Beneficiary. If the newborn or adopted Child is added to the covered Employee's COBRA Continuation Coverage, then, unlike a new spouse, the newborn or adopted Child will gain the rights of all other Qualified Beneficiaries. The addi tion of a newborn or adopted Child does not extend the eighteen (18) or twenty-nine (29) month coverage period. Plan procedures for adding new Dependents can be found in the Eligibility and Effective Date sect ions of this Plan. Premium rates will be adjusted at that time to the applicable rate. OPEN ENROLLMENTS Should an Open Enrollment Period occur during the COBRA continuation period, the Plan Administrator will notify the COBRA Participant of that right as we ll. If an Open Enrollment Period occurs, the Qualified Beneficiary will have the same rights to select the co verage and any of the options or plans that are available for similarly situated non-COBRA Participants. TIMING OF THE ELECTION NOTICE If a Qualifying Event is the Covered Employee's loss of coverage due to termination of employment, reduction in hours, death or Medicare entitlement, the Plan Administrator has forty-four (44) days to notify the Qualified Beneficiary of the right to elect COBR A coverage or, if applicable, the Plan Administrator must notify the COBRA Administrato r within thirty (30) days of the Qualifying Event, and the COBRA Administrator has fourteen (14) days to notify the Qualified Beneficiary of the right to elect COBRA coverage. 90 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE UNDER USERRA This section summarizes continuation of coverage under this Plan for Employees absent from work due to military service. The Plan intends to provide bene fits as a result of military Leave of Absence as mandated by USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time. As an Employee you have a right to choose this conti nuation of coverage if you are absent from work due to service in one of the uniformed se rvices of the United States. \"Service \" means: active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty and absence from work to determine the Employee's fitnes s for any of the designated types of duty. Employees who are dishonorably dischar ged from the military ar e not eligible for continuation of coverage under USERRA. Under the law, the Employee must give the Employer written or verbal adva nce notice of the military leave, if it is practical to do so, and failure to do so may result in the departing Employee's coverage being cancelled, unless the Employee is excused from giving advance notice of service under USERRA's provisions because it was impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity. A designated, authorized officer of the branch of the military in which the Employee will be serving may also provide such notice directly to the Employer. Coverage also may be cancelled if a departing Employ ee leaves for a period of service that exceeds thirty (30) days and gives advance notice of service, but fa ils to elect continuation coverage. However, should the Employee pay all unpaid amounts due within sixty (60) days from the date the Employee left for such service, then the Employee will be retroactively rein stated with uninterrupted co verage to the Employee's date of departure. If the Employee chooses Continuation of Coverage under USERRA, the Employer is required to offer coverage identical to that provided under the Plan prio r to the Employee's military leave. If the Employee takes military leave on or after December 10, 2004, and the Employee lost coverage due to that military service, the Employee has the right to elect to ext end coverage for the Employee, the Employee's spouse and the Employee's Dependents who are covered by the Pl an for up to twenty-four (24) months while the Employee remains on active duty, or during the peri od that the Employee's reemployment rights are protected. During the first thirty (30) days of leav e, the cost of the coverage the Employee elects is the same as the rate that the Employee paid as an Employee. After that time, the rate is the same rate that the Plan charges for COBRA Continuation Coverage . If the Employee or another member of the Employee's Family covered by the Plan becomes disa bled during the first sixty (60) days of such coverage, and the Employee provides to the Plan a copy of the Social Security Administration determination of disability before the end of the twenty- four (24) months of cove rage, the coverage by the Plan for the Employee, as well as the Employee's spous e and other Family members, can be extended to twenty-nine (29) months. The Employee will have to pay a higher rate for this additional five (5) months of coverage. In addition, if there is an event that would allow the Employee's spouse or Dependent to receive thirty-six (36) months of COBRA covera ge, as described above under the COBRA Continuation Coverage provisions, then the Employee's spouse or De pendent will be entitled to elect such coverage if they notify the Plan within sixty (60) days after the event occurs. If the Employee does not make timely premium paym ents, then the Plan will provide the Employee with thirty (30) days written notice to pay the premiums. If the Employee fails to pay the requested premium(s) within the thirty (30) days, the Plan has the right to cancel the Em ployee's continuation of coverage. If an Employee's or a Dependent of an Employee's heal th plan coverage was terminated by reason of service in the uniformed services, that coverage mu st be reinstated upon reemployment, unless the Plan imposes an exclusion or Waiting Period as to illnes ses or injuries determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the perfo rmance of service. If you feel you might have continuation rights under USERRA, please contact Human Resources as soon as possible. 91 Perry County PPO Plan Eff: 1/1/18 DEFINITIONS Terminology listed below, along with the definition or ex planation of the manner in which the term is used, will be recognized for the purpose of this Plan, only if used in this Plan.
