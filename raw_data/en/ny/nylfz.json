Tetanus is a sometimes fatal disease of the central nervous system. It's caused by a poison (toxin) made by the tetanus bacterium. The bacterium usually enters the body through an open wound. Tetanus bacteria live in soil and manure. They can also be found in the human intestine and other places. - Tetanus occurs more often in warmer climates or during the warmer months. - Tetanus is very uncommon in the U.S. due to widespread immunization. What causes tetanus? Tetanus is caused by the toxin of the bacterium clostridium tetani. It's not spread from person to person. It occurs in people who have had a skin or deep tissue wound or puncture. It's also seen in the umbilical stump of infants in developing countries. This occurs in places where vaccines for tetanus are not widespread and where parents may not know how to care for the stump after the baby is born. After a person is exposed to tetanus, it may take from 3 to 21 days for symptoms to develop. On average, symptoms appear around day 8. In infants, symptoms may take from 3 days to 2 weeks to develop. What are the symptoms of tetanus? These are the most common symptoms of tetanus: - Stiff jaw (also called lockjaw) - Stiff abdominal and back muscles - Contraction of the facial muscles - Fast pulse - Fever - Sweating - Painful muscle spasms, especially near the wound area (if these affect the throat or chest wall, breathing may be stopped) - Trouble swallowing These symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. How is tetanus diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will ask about your health history and do a physical exam. How is tetanus treated? Your healthcare provider will decide on treatment based on: - How old you are - Your overall health and past health - How sick you are - How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies - How long the condition is expected to last - Your opinion or preference Treatment for tetanus (or to reduce the risk of tetanus after an injury) may include: - Medicines to control spasms - Thorough cleaning of the wound - Antitoxin injections - Use of a ventilator (breathing machine) if you have trouble breathing on your own - Antibiotics - Other medicines to control pain and other symptoms such as a fast heartbeat What are possible complications of tetanus? Complications of tetanus can include: - Vocal cord spasms - Broken bones due to severe muscle spasms - Breathing problems - Pneumonia - High blood pressure or abnormal heart rhythms - Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) - Death Can tetanus be prevented? A DTaP shot is a combination vaccine that protects against 3 diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The CDC recommends that children get 5 DTaP shots. The first 3 shots are given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Between 15 and 18 months of age, the child gets the fourth shot. A fifth shot is given when a child enters school at 4 to 6 years of age. At regular checkups for 11- or 12-year-olds, a preteen should get a dose of Tdap. The Tdap booster is a tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine. If an adult did not get a Tdap as a preteen or teen, that person should get a dose of Tdap instead of the Td booster. Adults should get a Td booster every 10 years. But it can be given before the 10-year mark. Always see your healthcare provider for advice. When should I call my healthcare provider? If you get a wound from an object that is contaminated with dirt, animal feces, or manure, you should see your healthcare provider. You may need a tetanus booster shot if it has been more than 5 years since your previous vaccination or you can't remember your last vaccination. If you have any of the symptoms listed in the symptoms section, get medical care right away. Tetanus requires urgent attention.
