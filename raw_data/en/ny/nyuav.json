Plan ahead and talk about your [birth plan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/) with your birth partner and midwife. Write in your birth plan that you have PGP, so the people supporting you during labour and birth will be aware of your condition. Think about birth positions that are the most comfortable for you, and write them in your birth plan. Being in water can take the weight off your joints and allow you to move more easily, so you might want to think about having a water birth. You can discuss this with your midwife.
