Over the past year there have been no written comments or public input. The 2014 Community Health Needs Assessment Report updates and expands upon the previously adopted version. This rep ort presents the findings from the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) conducted June - September 2014. These findings will be used to inform the priority focus areas for our hospital's Community Benefits Implementation Strategy. The main body of this report is divided into the following sections: community served, how the CHNA was conducted, significant health needs identified through the CHNA and priori tized significant health needs. Section 1 | Commun ity served: Walworth County Although Aurora Lakeland Medical Center (ALMC) serves Walworth County and beyond, for the purpose of the community health needs assessment the community served is defined as Walworth County. Walworth County is located in southeastern Wisconsin. The diversified topography has rolling hills, forests, prairies, marshes, meadows, and winding streams. There are 24 lakes, the largest being Geneva Lake, which is nine miles long, from one to three miles wide, with water suppli ed by fresh springs. Located within the county boundary are Price Park, Natureland, and White River Trail. Walworth County is home to the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater and George Williams College of Aurora University located in Lake Geneva.2 Walworth consists of 28 municipalities, mainly suburban and rural areas:3 4 cities: Delevan, Elkhorn, Lake Geneva, and Whitewater 16 towns: Bloomfield, Darien, Delavan, East Troy, Geneva, Lafayette, LaGrange, Linn, Lyons, Richmond, Sharon, Spring Prairie, Sugar Cr eek, Troy, Walworth, Whitewater 8 villages: Bloomfield, Darien, East Troy, Fontana, Genoa City, Mukwonago, Walworth, Williams Bay Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 6 of 58 Walworth County Demographic Information According to the 2008 -2012 American Com munity Survey, the population of Walworth County is 102,310.

The community health survey is supported by additional data collection and analysis from the Center for Urban Population Health, www.cuph.org . The 2014 C ommunity Health Needs Assessment is based on prior efforts un dertaken by Aurora Health Care to assess community health needs. Since 2003, Aurora Health Care has underwritten a community health survey of Walworth County every three years, conducted in partnership w ith the Walworth County Public Health Department . This helped the health department focus its resources on population health issues and enabled Aurora Health Care to align its charitable resources and expertise to respond to the identified community healt h priorities. To view community health surveys dating back to 2003, visit http://www.aurora.org/commbenefits . Purpose and process of the Community Health Needs Assessment In 2014, the Community Health Needs A ssessment (CHNA) was conducted to 1) determine current community health needs in Walworth County, 2) gather input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community and to identify community assets, 3) identify and prioritize significant health needs, and 4) develop implementation strategies to address the prioritized health needs within the context of the hospital's existing programs, resources, strategic goals and partnerships. The process of conducting the CHNA is illustrated below and is described in this report. Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 11 of 58 Data collection and analysis Quantitative data was collected through primary and secondary sources and was supplemented with qualitative data gathered through key informant interviews and focus groups. Different data sour ces were collected, analyzed and published at different intervals and therefore the data years (e.g., 2012, 2014) will vary in this report. The most current data available was used for the CHNA. The core data sources for the CHNA include: Quantitative data sources Walworth County Community Health Survey Report The community health survey is a source of primary community health data. The latest telephone survey was completed between June 16 and August 21, 2014. This comprehensive phone -based survey gathers specific data on behavioral and lifestyle habits of the adult population. In addition, this report collects data on the prevalence of risk factors and disease conditions existing within the adult population and compares, where appropriate and available, h ealth data of residents to state and national measures . Conducted approximately every three years, the survey can be used to identify community trends and changes over time. New questions and m easures have been added at different points in time . JKV Resear ch, LLC , analyzed the data and prepared the final report. For further description see Appendix A, and for the data summary see Appendix D. Secondary Data Report This report summarizes the demographic and health-related information for Walworth County (Appendix B ). Data used in the report came from publicly available data sources. Data for each indicator is presented by race, ethnicity and gender when the data is available. When applicable, Healthy People 2020 objectives are presented for each indicator. The report was prepared in summer 2014 by the Center for Urban Population Health. For further description see Appendix B. Qualitative data source Key Informant Interview Report Sixteen individual key informant interviews were conducted between June and July 2014. Each key informant was asked to rank order the top 3 to 5 major health -related issues for Walworth County, based on the focus areas presented in Wisconsin's State Health Plan, Healthiest Wisconsin 2020. For each top -ranked health topic the informa nt was asked to specify existing strategies to address the issue, barriers or challenges to addressing the issue, additional strategies needed, and key groups in the community that hospitals should partner with to improve community health. A mong the key in formants was the healt h officer for the Walworth County Health Department , as well as leaders of government agencies, health systems, social service agencies and community organizations . These key informants focused on a range of public health i ssues or he alth disparities and represented the broad interest of the commun ity served, including medically underserved, low income and minority populations. For further description see Appendix C. The Key Informant Interview Report presents the results, including cross -cutting themes and summaries of the top five health issues and additional health issues. Moreover, the Key Informant Interview Report compiles a listing of potential resources and partnerships id entified to address community health issues . The report was prepared by the Center for Urban Population Health. Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 12 of 58 Data gaps and limitation s It is important to note that the data was collected at one point in time, so while these findings are valuable and informative indicators , they should not be interpreted as definitive. Although a comprehensive, collaborative approach was utilized and valid data sources were used for the community health needs assessment, some gaps and limitations exist. These are noted below. County level data are often not available for health topics (e.g. alcohol and drug dependence). Similarly, data is not available at the zip code level. In some cases, data are aggregated across multiple years to increase sample size (e.g. 2006- 2010) . Public health surveillance data has its limitations re garding whether the sample size for specific population groups is l arge enough for sub -group analys es. Several sources did not provide current data stratified by race/ethnicity, gender or age; therefore, this data could only be analyzed by total population . Countywide data that characterize health conditions, risk factors and lifestyle behaviors such as childhood obesity, diabetes, nutrition, exercise, tobacco use and mental health, are limited or not available for children and adolescents. Although the mos t recently available data were used for this assessment, several secondary data sources are one or more years old due to the nature of the reporting system used. While the key informant interviews are an essential part of the assessment and provide importa nt insight into existing and emerging population health issues, the report relies on the opinions and experiences of a limited number of experts identified as having the community's pulse and responses may not be representative of the overall perception of community strengths and needs . Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 13 of 58 Section 3 | Significant health needs identified through the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for Walworth County The following County Health Rankings diagram is based on a model of population health that emphasizes the many factors that, if improved, can help make communities healthier places to live, learn, work and play. The health of individuals and communities is influenced by many health factors, including obesity, smoking, access to care, education, income, employment status and level of family and social support. Factors such as income and education are also referred to as upstream factors or social determinants of health. Health factors, such as the ones listed above, can impact health outcomes. I n the case of the Rankings , health outcomes represent how healthy a county is and are measured in two ways: 1) length of life (mortality) and 2) quality of life (how healthy people feel while alive) . According to the 2014 County Health Rankings released b y the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundati on, Walworth County ranked 32 nd for health factors and 38th for health outcomes (out of 72 counties) for Wisconsin's healthiest counties.4 Informed by this f ramework, this assessment provides information on many of these factors and key health outcomes among the people of Walworth County. The significant health needs (health needs and issues that rose to the top) identified through the CHNA are also identifi ed as key health issues for the state as outlined in the state health plan, Healthiest Wisconsin 2020, and the nation's health plan, Healthy People 2020, and are among major focus areas of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From a county perspective, the significant health needs identified through the CHNA have an impact on community health, both for the community at- large and in particular specific areas within the community (such as neighborhoods or populations experiencing health dispa rities). The Healthy People 2020 definition of a health disparity: If a health outcome is seen in greater or lesser extent between populations, there is disparity. Race or ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, age, disability, socioeconomic status and geographic location all contribute to an individual's ability to achieve good health. Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 14 of 58 A wide variety of health issues and needs were identified in the 2014 Community Health Needs Assessment. To help select the major or most significant health issues, the following criteria were used: Burden of the health issue on individuals, families, hospitals and/or health care systems (e.g., illness, complications, cost, death); Scope of the health issue within the community and the health implications; Health disparities linked with the health issue; and/or Health priorities identified in the municipal health department Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) Based on the criteria listed above, the most significant health issues for Walworth County include: Access Healt h care coverage Chronic disease (asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and cancer) Alcohol, tobacco and drug use Nutrition and physical activity High cholesterol Overweight and obesity Mental health Sexual assault and domestic violence Teen pregnancy The remainder of this section provides a summary of the key findings from the 2014 community health survey, secondary data and key informant report. Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 15 of 58 Overview of significant health needs identified for Walworth County Access 2014 Community H ealth Survey key findings In 2014, about 1 of 7 respondents reported in the past 12 months someone in their household was unable to take prescription medication due to cost. In 2014, 11% of respondents reported unmet medical care in the past 12 months, an increase from 2011 (7%) . This translates to approximately 8,800 adults in Walworth County. From 2011 to 2014 the percent of respondents reporting unmet dental care increased fourfold. Unmet prescription medications not taken due to cost, unmet medical and dental care do not meet the Healthy People 2020 targets.

This is definition currently used by t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All other years were five or more drinks per occasion, regardless of gender. From 2003 to 2014 the percent of respondents reporting binge drinking in the past month nearly doubled. In 2014, 29% of respondent s reported binge drinking in the past month. This translates to approximately 23,200 adults in Walworth County. From 2003 to 2014 the percent of respondents reporting cigarette use (current smoker) held relat ively stable. In 2014, 25% of respondents reported tobacco cigarette smoking in the past month ( 7% smoked some days and 18% smoked every day in the past month).

In 2014, 3% of respondents reported using electronic cigarette (also known as e -cigarettes; question added in 2014). Little is actually known yet about the health risks of using e -cigarettes. Although they do not produce tobacco smoke, e- cigarettes still contain nicotine and other potentially harmful chemicals.17 Secondary Data Report key findings Smoking during pregnancy Research has shown that smoking during pregnancy can cause health problems for both mother and baby, such as pregnancy complications, premature birth, low birth weight infants and stillbirth.18 From 2010 to 2012 the percent of Walworth County mothers indicating smoking during pregnancy de creased from 15.5% to 12.7% in 2012.

Recommended fruit intake is defined as at least two servings of fruit each day and vegetable intake as at least three servings of vegetables (USDA dietary guideline for fruit intake). 2014 Community Health Survey Key Findings From 2003 to 2014 recommended fruit intake declined . For recommended vegetable intake, from 2003 to 2005 there was sharp decline, but has remained stable from 2005 to 2014. From 2008 to 2014 re commended physic al activity held steady. In 2014, less than half of respondents reported they engaged in recommended physical activity, about 3 of 5 reported consuming recommended fruit intake, and approximately 1 of 4 reported eating recommended vegetable intake.

Recommended fruit intake (2+ servings/day) female college education met the recommended amount of physical activity A healthy and balanced diet, including eating fruits and vegetables, is associated with reduced risk for many diseases, including several of the leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. A poor diet can lead to energy imbalance (e.g., eating more calories than one expends through physical activity) and can increase one's risk for overweight and obesity. Healthy eating helps reduce one's risk for developing osteoporosis, iron deficiency and dental cavities. 19 Recommended v egetable intake (3+ servings/day) female 55 to 64 years old college education married Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 Page 25 of 58 Secondary Data Report key findings Long -commute - driving alone A 2012 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the farther people commute by vehicle, the higher their blood pressure and body mass index.

We recognize our role in addressing concerns about the accessibility and affordability of health care in Walworth County. Further, we recognize that we are accountable to our patients and communities and that our initiatives to support our communities must fit our role as a not -for-profit community hospital. It is not surprising that we are asked to support a wide array of community activities and events in our area . However, today's community health needs require us to reserve limited charitable resources for programs and initiatives that improve access for underserved persons and specifically support community health improvement initiatives. The implementation strategies presented here are the res ult of our process for assessing community health needs, obtaining input from community members and public health representatives, prioritizing needs and consulting with our hospital staff and physician partners. Our strategies are organized into three mai n categories in alignment with three core principles of community benefit as shown below. Category Community Benefit Core Principle Focus area Priority #1: Access Access for persons in our community with disproportionate unmet health needs Access Health care coverage Priority #2: Community Health Improvement Build links between our clinical services and local health department community health improvement plan Alcohol, tobacco and other drug use Blood pressure, cholesterol and overweight/ob esity Priority #3: Community Benefit Hospital Focus Address the underlying causes of persistent health problems Injury (newborn safety and falls prevention among older adults) Chronic disease Senior care Sexual assault These implementation strategies do not constitute the entirety of the community benefits our hospital provides each year. A full accounting of our community benefits are reported each year and can be found by visiting http://www.aurora.o rg/commbenefits . Principal community health improvement tool: Community Partnerships For any community health concern, it is widely recognized that a diverse team of engaged community partners is essential for implementing strategic community health i mprovement initiatives that make a difference. Therefore, we recognize the need to be a good community partner. Our implementation strategies strongly reinforce our role as a partner for community capacity -building to address unmet community health needs. This Community Benefit Implementation Strategy was adopted by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Aurora Health Care Board of Directors on December 11, 2014.

In 2014, 25% of respondents reported tobacco cigarette use (current smoker) (same as 2003 ). Binge drinking (also referred to as excessive drinking) is associated with an array of health problems, including but not limit ed to unintentional and intentional injuries, alc ohol poisoning, unintended pregnancy, and poor control of chronic disease s. Smoking increases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and several types of cancer (acute myeloid leukemia, bladder, cervix, esophagus, kidney, larynx, lung, mouth, pancreatic, throat and stomach). Cancer is a leading cause of death in Walworth County. Based on the Key Informant Interview Report, alcohol and drugs was a top five health issue for Walworth County. According to Wisconsin Interactive Statistics on Health: In 2012, 12.7% percent of Wa lworth County mothers indicated smoking during pregnancy.

Based on the Wisconsin Statistics on Health : In 2012, Walworth County's rate of emergency department visits for injury was higher compared to the state (7,595.3 versus 6,923.2 per 100,000). The most common ca use of ED visits for injury w as falls (2,310 per 100,000), followed by struck by or against object or person (1,190 per 100,000). In 2012, f or adults aged 65 years and older the injury death rate for falls in Walworth County was 106.3 per 100,000. As outlined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, e ach year, one in every three adults age 65 and older falls. Falls can cause moderate to severe injuries, such as hip fractures and head injuries, and can increase the risk of early death. Fortunately, there are prevention strategies to reduce falls and related injuries. Older adults who practice healthy behaviors, take advantage of clinical preventive services, and continue to engage with family and friends are more likely to remain healthy, live independently, and incur fewer he alth-related costs. Aurora's Senior Resource Nurse (SRN) program -designated ( http://www.nicheprogram.org ), non- billable, geriatric nurse -driven program to help our hospital improve the care of older adults treated within our system and also frail elderly persons referred from within our community.

The sampling strategy was two- fold. 1) A random -digit -dial landline sample of telephone numbers which included listed and unlisted numbers. The respondent within each household was randomly selected by computer and based on the number of adults in the household (n=300). 2) A cell phone -only sample where the person answering the phone was selected as the respondent (n=100). At least 8 attempts were made to contact a respondent in both samples. Screener questions verifying location were included. Data collection was conducted by Management Decisions Incorporated. A total of 400 telephone interviews were completed between June 16 and August 21, 2014. Weighting of Data For the landline sample, weighting was based on the number of adults in the household and the number of residential phone numbers, excluding fax and computer lines, to take into account the probability of selection. For the cell -phone only sample, it was assumed the respondent, if an adult, was the primary cell phone user. Combined, post -stratification was conducted by sex and age to reflect the 2010 census proportion of these characteristics in the area. Margin of Error With a sample size of 400, we can be 95% sure that the sample percenta ge reported would not vary by more than \u00b15 percent from what would have been obtained by interviewing all persons 18 years old and older with telephones in the county. This margin of error provides us with confidence in the data; 95 times out of 100, the true value will likely be somewhere between the lower and upper bound. The margin of error for smaller subgroups will be larger than \u00b15 percent, since fewer respondents are in that category (e.g., adults 65 years old or older who were asked if they ever rec eived a pneumonia vaccination). In 2013, the Census Bureau estimated 79,988 adult residents in the county. Thus, in this report, one percentage point equals approximately 800 adults. So, when 17% of respondents reported their health was fair or poor, this roughly equals 13,600 residents \u00b14,000 individuals. Therefore, from 9,600 to 17,600 residents likely have fair or poor health. Because the margin of error is \u00b15%, events or health risks that are small will include zero. In 2013, the Census Bureau estimat ed 39,758 occupied housing units in Walworth County. In certain questions of the Community Health Survey, respondents were asked to report information about their household. Using the 2013 household estimate, each percentage point for household- level data represents approximately 400 households. Statistical Significance The use of statistics is to determine whether a true difference between two percentages is likely to exist. If a difference is statistically significant, it is unlikely that the difference between the two percentages is due to chance. Conversely, if a difference is not statistically significant, it is likely there is no real difference. For example, the difference between the percentage of adults reporting they had an advance care plan in 2 003 (34%) and the percentage of adults reporting this in 2014 (38%) is not statistically significant and so it is likely not a real difference, it is within the margin of error of the survey. Aurora Lakeland Medical Center | December, 2014 - DRAFT Page 46 of 58 Data Interpretation Data that has been found \"statistically significant\" and \"not statistically significant\" are both important for stakeholders to better understand county residents as they work on action plans. Additionally, demographic cross - tabulations provide information on whether or not there are statistically significant differences within the demographic categories (gender, age, education, household income level and marital status). Demographic data cannot be broken down for race and ethnicity because there are too few cases in the sample. Finally, Healthy People 2020 goals as well as Wisconsin and national percentages are included to provide another perspective of the health issues. Household income definition Household income: It is difficult to compare household income data throughout the years as the real dollar value changes. Each year, the Census Bureau classifies household income into five equal brackets, rounded to the nearest dollar. It is not possible to exactly match the survey income categories to the Census Bureau brackets since the survey cate gories are in increments of $10,000 or more; however, it is the best way to track household income. This report looks at the Census Bureau's bottom 40%, middle 20% and top 40% household income brackets each survey year. In 2003 and 2005, the bottom 40% income bracket included survey categories less than $30,001, the middle 20% income bracket was $30,001 to $50,000 and the top 40% income bracket was at least $50,001. In 2009, 2011 and 2014, the bottom 40% income bracket included survey categories less than $40,001, the middle 20% income bracket was $40,001 to $60,000 and the top 40% income bracket was at least $60,001.
