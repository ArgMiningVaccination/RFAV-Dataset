The M inistry has recently issued Ayush recommendations for the public on holistic health and well-being \"Preventive measures and care during COVID -19 & long COVID -19\".11 Mobilization of Human Resource As part of the efforts to achieve maximum stakeholder mobilization, the Ministry immed iately acted as follows: Communicated to the Heads of all Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Homoeopathy institutes for the appropriate utilization of available infrastructure facilities such as, hospital (IPD and OPD), pathology laboratory, ICU, along with medical and paramedical staff to combat the COVID -19 pandemic. Various Ayush hospitals were designated as quarantine centres, isolation centres, and COVID -care centres by respective State Governments. The Hon'ble Prime Minister addressed the stakeholders of the Ayush sector on March 28, 2020 to provide their services whenever needed by the State Governments. More than eight lakh Ayush doctors, paramedic staff, and students offered their services for the clinical management, surveillance, and management of COVID isolation centres and quarantine wards by enlisting themselves on COVID warrior portal . Details of trained Ayush personnel were made available at State/District administration and they have been utilized in the fight against COVID -19 as and when required. Training on \"COVID - 19 Preparedness, Response and Containment\" was provided to the Ayush stakeholders to develop master trainers across the states. Ministry of Ayush and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) have jointly provided training to 33,000 Ayush master trainers. Total 83,000 Ayush personnel had obtained training at Integrated Government Online T raining (iGOT) portal on continual basis. Further, different states have also pro vided training to about 1.06 lakh s Ayush personnel. As per available information, around 28,473 Ayush staff was deployed for COVID -19 related healthcare services. During the recent crisis of manpower and infrastructure in the second wave of COVID -19 pandemic, Ministry of Ayush has communicated to all States/UTs and released advisory for augmentation of Ayush human resource in the management of COVID -19 at appropriat e levels under the supervision of medical expert/specialist and in managing e -sanjeevani portal for tele -consultation and counseling. 11 Ministry of Ayush , Govt. of India 2021.

The Ministry interacted with Principal Secretaries Ayush/Directors of Ayush from all States and UTs to expedite the utilization of Ayush human resource and infrastructure in the mitigation of COVID -19; and also extended support through the budget in the Nation al Ayush Mission for procuring AYUSH -64 and Ayuraksha Kit to further strengthen the fight against COVID -19. Dissemination of MoA Initiatives on COVID -19 among masses The Ministry has launched a campaign \"AYUSH for Immunity\" to bring behavioral changes in the general public towards promotion of immunity through Ayush interventions wherein more than fifty thousand people participated.12 The Ministry has also published a campaign bulletin on \"AYUSH for Immunity\". Webinars were also organized to sensitize the Ayush practitioners. The Ministry has also set-up an Ayush COVID -19 Dashboard to furnish the guidelines related to AYUSH measures for improving immunity, official communications, research undertaken on COVID - 19, measures for prophylaxis and management.13 The National Repository on Ayush COVID -19 clinical and other R&D initiatives was developed to disseminate information related to Ayush R&D initiatives, COVID -19 related AYUSH clinical trials and scientific publications and is available on the AYUSH Research Portal of the MoA.14 12Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. India 14 Ministry AYUSH, Govt. of India 2020. National Repository on AYUSH COVID -19 Clinical and Other R&D Initiatives at AYUSH Research Portal. http://ayushportal.nic.in/Covid.aspx 7 R&D initiatives on COVID -19 undertaken by the Ministry of Ayush The Ministry of Ayush (MoA), Government of India has undertaken several R&D initiatives to harness the potential of Ayush systems to contain the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. The MoA collaborated with several research organizations to encourage, promote and advance evidence -based research on Ayush systems. These multi -pronged initiatives aimed at creating public awareness regarding measures to improve immunity and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Glimpses of R&D initiatives on COVID -19 The MoA constituted an inter -disciplinary Ayush R&D Task Force consisting of scientists, pulmonologists, epidemiologists, pharmacologists etc., from premier organizations and research institutions and seven working groups to deal with various aspects of clinical and experimental research.15 The Task Force formulated guidelines for Ayush clinical and observational studies in COVID - 19 covering various aspects of trial protocols.16 The Task Force has also taken up proposals received from screening committees of Research Councils under the Ministry and proactively explored possibilities for research based on available leads. The Ministry of Ayush issued a gazette notification to faci litate research on COVID -19 through Ayush systems across the country.17 The ambit of this notification includes prophylactic measures and interventions for the quarantine, asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of COVID -19, with a view to generate scientific e vidence. Taking forward the recommendations of the Interdisciplinary Task Force, 139 clinical research studies and basic experimental studies were initiated at approximately 159 centers by Research Councils and National Institutes under the Ministry through the Intra -mural and collaborative research mode. So far, 139 clinical, pre -clinical and epidemiol ogical studies viz. Ayurveda (70 studies), Homeopathy (29 studies), Siddha (13 studies), Unani (08 stu dies) and Yoga & Naturopathy (19 studies) were undertaken by the Research Councils and National Institutes under the Ministry. The collaborative institutes for these studies include AIIMS New Delhi, AIIMS New Jodhpur, King George Medical University Lucknow, Institute of Medical Sciences BHU, Govt. Medical College Nagpur, DMIMS Wardha, KEM Hospital Pune, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research Kolkata, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology New Delhi, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Jammu, Employee State Insurance Scheme hospitals, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India 15Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India 2020.

Guidelines for Clinical Trials on i nterventions Gazette Notification CG-DL-E-21042020 -219088; dated 21st April 2020 8 institutes such as Regional Centre of Biotechnology and Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) etc. It includes 22 experimental studies, 44 prop hylactic, 44 therapeutic ( standalone and add -on treatment ), 15 obse rvational studies, 10 survey studies, two pharmacopeia standard development and two systematic reviews (Figure 1) . The clinical studies were monitored and reviewed by Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for monitoring of clinical trials and population based prophylactic studies of AYUSH interventions related to COVID -19. The Ministry has also constituted a Project Management Unit to coordinate these studies and providing technical assistance throughout all phases of the studies conducted at different centers. The prophylactic interventional studies were conducted in high -risk population either residing in containment zones or frontline workers through AYUSH Research Councils and National Institutes (Figure 2) . These studies have shown very promising outcomes in reducing the incidence of COVID -19 among Ayush prophylactic care users. Well-designed clinical studies on Ayush interventions as stand - alone or adjunct to standard of care in asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID -19 patients adopting integrated protocols were conducted (Figure 3) . The core outcomes of these studies demonstrated early clinical recovery and achieving early negative RT -PCR results, reduction in the duration of hospital stay, prevention in further progress to severe stage and complications, and improvement in quality of life. The Ministry has recently funded a novel research study to explore the safety, immunogenicity and protection of Ashwagandha administration with COVID -19 vaccine (COVISHIELDTM). The objective of this s tudy is to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of Ashwagandha in vaccinated individuals and to assess the effect of Ashwagandha on the sustenance of the vaccine response. The outcomes of this study will hold importance as sustenance of immune response to the vaccine will have implications for long term prevention against COVID -19 including breakthrough infection. This study has been cond ucted at seven study sites ( Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Jaipur, Belgaum and Hassan ).

These studies are periodically reviewed by an independent Monitoring Committee. Also, all the tria l related activities of these studies have been audited by an independent clinical trial auditor. Among these, a multicenter study on AYUSH -64 has been completed. Study participants treated with AYUSH - 64 recovered early compared to standard of care group. Significant beneficial effects of AYUSH -64 on general health, fatigue, anxiety, stress, appetite, general happiness and sleep were also observed. No study drug related SAE reported and AYUSH -64 was well tolerated (clinically and as per lab parameters). The other three studies are also completed and final report is being prepared. Other Research Studies on Ayurvedic Interventions The for prophylaxis have been provided to population residing in containment zones and high risk healthcare workers and individuals across the country. Ayurvedic have been evaluated in asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID -19 patients as standalone or add-on intervention with standard care. Further, in-silico studies on AYUS H-64 and AYUSH Kwatha have been undertaken in collaboration with National Institute of Nutrition Hyderabad (ICMR) and Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi respectively to evaluate their ingredients for inhibitory action against SARS -CoV-2 Main Protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Also, a pre -clinical study has been conducted at National Institute of Nutrition Hyderabad (ICMR) to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential and safety/ toxicity of Ayush Kwatha formulation. Research Studies on Homeopathy Interventions The homeopathic medicines extensively studied against COVID -19 are Arsenicum album 30 C for cases of COVID -19 as add -on intervention. Prophylactic efficacy of Arsenicum album 30 C has been evaluated in containment zones of prime cities in India such as Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Surat, slums of Dharawi, Mumbai and prison complexes in Delhi. 11 The outcome from the overall population studied reveal statistically significant results in reducing the incidence of COVID - 19 compared to the non -intervention cohorts in all the studies. Further, studies on Homeopathic medicines as add-on to standard care have been conducted to assess its therapeutic efficacy in asymptomatic and mild COVID -19 patients. The results of these studies reveal trend of early recovery and lesser mortalit y rate compared to the control group. For understanding the mechanistic pathways of Cinchona officinalis (3C, 6C &12C), a -viral drug against SARS CoV -2, an in-vitro study is being conducted by National Institute of Homeopathy. Research Studies on Unani Interventions Population based prophylactic studies have been conducted in Lucknow, Srinagar, Mumbai, Aligarh, New Delhi and Bengaluru among high and moderate risk population through Unani Interventions. Lower incidence of COVID -19 has been observed during the study period in the intervention group. Further, two studies have been undertaken to assess the role of Unani therapeutic regimen as add on to the standard of care, in preventing the progression of the severity of the disease in mild to moderate COVID -19 cases. The early clinical recovery has been observed in the Unani intervention group as compared to the control group. Unani medicines have been well tolerated in all these studies. In -silico screening of four Unani for Unani Joshanda revealed their potential as binding energy against SARS -CoV-2 protein i.e. Spike glycoprotein and Main Joshanda and Unani Joshanda has also been developed followed by preparation of monographs. Research Studies on Siddha Interventions Siddha intervention Kabasura Kudineer (KSK) has been most extensively studied for its prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in COVID -19 in different medical institutes at Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi and Noida. Prophylactic studies on Kabasura kudineer showed that it effectively offers protection to high -risk population exposed to COVID -19 in containment zones. KSK when given as add -on to stand ard of care to the asymptomatic COVID -19 cases, shows significant reduction in the viral load for the 3 genes - ORF gene, E gene and S gene, in terms of ct value on the 10th day in the study group compared to the control group. Similarly, three RCT on Siddha formulations as add -on to standard care showed accelerated recovery and lesser mortality rate in the trial group compared to the standard care. Research Studies on Yoga Effect of Yoga was studied for its effect on stress, symptom severity, and heart rate variability in COVID -19patients undergoing conventional treatment and it showed significant reduction in anxiety 12 (Hamilton Rating scale) and clinical symptoms, significant improvement in heart rate variability and increased relaxation response. Yoga also improved sleep latency, increase in REM and deep sleep and decrease in number of wakeful lness episodes in COVID -19 patients undergoing conventional treatment. The effect of yoga breathing 1:1, 1:2, Anulom -vilom Pranayama, was also studied on oxygen saturation levels and relaxation response in COVID -19 positive patients on oxygen supplementation. The interim trends from this ongoing study showed that, SPO 2 levels increased immediately followin g 27 rounds of yogic practices. Further, a randomized controlled pilot study to assess the effect of Pranayama on incidence of COVID -19 and mental status of healthcare personnel exposed to COVID -19 patients revealed that Pranayama for 28 days significantly decreased the COVID -19 positivity rate among exposed healthcare professionals working at five different COVID -19 centers in Delhi compared to the control group. National Repository on Ayush COVID -19 Clinical and Other R&D Initiatives The National Repository on Ayush has been developed to provide information related to Ayush R&D initiatives, COVID -19-related Ayush clinical trials sponsored/collaborated by the Ministry of Ayush and others agencies, and COVID -19 related scientific publica tions and Ayush guidelines. This repository is available on the Ayush Research Portal of the Ministry. Ayush Sanjivani Mobile Application based Population Study Subsequent to the issuance of AYUSH advisory and guidelines on COVID -19, the Ministry of Ayush developed and launched Ayush Sanjivani mobile application to generate data on acceptance, usage of AYUSH advocacies among the population and its impact in prevention of COVID -19. A cross- sectional analysis was done to evaluate the pattern and extent of ut ilization of Ayush -based measures, benefits obtained, association between the use of Ayush -based measures and incidence of COVID -19, symptomatic status, and duration of use of Ayush measures. More than 1.35 crore cumulative data of Ayush beneficiaries have been collected through this application. Further, 7,23,459 individual responses by general public and 74,568 individual responses submitted by Ayush physicians of their self -use has also been captured through this applicati on during this study. The findings of this study highlighted that a good proportion of the representative population has utilized Ayush measures across different regions of the country, during the COVID -19 pandemic and have considerable benefits in terms of general well-being and reduced incidence of COVID -19.18 13 Ayush -DBT Pre-clinical herbal extracts/formulations for mitigating SARS -CoV-2 and associated pathologies have been undertaken through Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India - Ayush Network Research Projects. These studies have been undertaken at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute Faridabad, India. The objective of these studies is to assess their in -vitro and in -vivo anti -viral activity against SARS -Cov-2 and immune - modulatory potential and also to generate pharmacokinetic data on seemingly potent candidates. The preclinical studies include nine priority interventions of oral use Anu taila showed better resul t in combating the effect of SAR -CoV2 infection as seen by low viral load in lungs in the Golden Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS -CoV-2. WHO -Ayush R&D Initiatives The Ministry of Ayush and World Health Organization has entered into the Technical service agreement to undertake a project \"Assessment of integration of Ayush into the Public Health System for combating COVID -19\". The study is being executed in collaboration with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) at select 10 states across the co untry to understand the level of integration of Ayush system of medicine within the national healthcare systems for combating COVID -19 as well as to understand community needs/ demand, current utilization, behavior and perception related to use of Ayush system in the prevention of COVID -19. AIIA-LSHTM Collaboration All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) with collaboration of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) is initiating a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled trial on Ashwagand ha to study its efficacy in promoting recovery in long -term symptoms following a recent COVID -19 illness. The trial has been conducted in 3 cities in the UK viz., Leicester, Birmingham, and London (Southall and Wembley). 18 Srikanth Rana R, Singhal BCS, Dhiman KS.

JMIRx Med 2021; 2(2):e25703 14 Other R&D support The Ministry of Ayush also developed an online mechanism for crowd sourcing of scientific evidence -based solutions from the Ayush systems to address the pandemic.19 The Ministry also modified the existing extramural research scheme to support short -term research projects for evaluating the impact of Ayush interventions in the prophylaxis and management of COVID -19. The Ministry set -up an Interdisciplinary Technical Review Committee (ITRC) for COVID -19 for the examination of the applications/claims on patent and proprietary ASU&H medicines/classical ASU&H medicines with new indication or re -purposing of licensed patent and proprietary, ASU& H medicines for COV ID-19. The committee reviewed 4 3 applications in the light of quality standards, preclinical safety requirements of the drug(s), and clinical efficacy with appropriate rationale. The Ministry also constituted a core group of experts to identify and propose formulations for prophylaxis, management of COVID -19, and post -COVID care. The interventions shortlisted for drug development and commercialization are based on the core principles of Ayush systems, and have substantial experimental an d clinical leads on the efficacy and safety from the COVID -19 studies undertaken by the Ministry. National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for management of COVID -19 The Ministry has set -up an Interdisciplinary Committee for Integration of Ayurveda and Yoga Interventions in the 'National Clinical Management Protocol: COVID -19 to crystallize the outcomes and interim trends of COVID -19 studies undertaken by different institutes under the Ministry. The Committee has formulated i ts First Report & Recommendations based on the interim trends of ongoing and completed Ayush studies on COVID -19 and experimental and clinical published data indicating potential benefits and safety of Ayush interventions.20 Based on NITI Aayog and ICMR recommendations on the committee report, the Ministry of Ayush has issued the National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda & Yoga for management of COVID -19 on 6th October, 2020 enabling uniform clinical management.21 This protocol is for the management of asymptomatic and mild COVID -19 cases.

The Y oga protocol is for the primary prevention from COVID -19 and post -COVID care by improving the respiratory and cardiac efficiency, reducing stress and anxiety and enhancing immunity. Scientific Publication of outcomes of COVID related Research Studies The Ministry constituted an advisory panel on July 29, 2020 to provide their inputs and suggestions for the finalization of manuscripts related to the outcomes of the research studies on COVID -19 for publication in scientific journals of high repute. The details of manuscripts published and available as preprint are available from Page 53 onwards of this document. Translation of Research Outcomes to the masses Based on the empirical evidence, AYUSH -64, a polyherbal formulation developed by Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of Ayush was repurposed for COVID -19 and extensive studies viz. in -silico, in -vitro and clinical studies were conducted to evaluate its therapeutic potential. The in-silico molecular docking study conducted at ICMR -National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad showed that among 36 compounds, 35 exhibited good binding energies than the published positive co -crystal compound of N3 peptide. In -vitro antiviral screening assay of AYUSH -64 Ministry of Ayush -Departm ent of Biotechnology (DBT) collaborative study at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) also demonstrated reduction of viral load of SARS CoV -2. The seven clinical studies on AYUSH -64 conducted at nine reputed medical institutions s howed its efficacy in the treatment of asymptomatic & mild cases as standalone and for the management of mild and moderate COVID -19 as an adjunct to standard care. It was observed that AYUSH -64 as adjunct treatment to Standard Care resulted in significant improvement in clinical recovery and duration of hospital stay without any progression of the disease to severe or critical stage. Also, there was improvement in Quality of life (QoL) parameters. AYUSH -64 was found to be well tolerated and safe. Kabasura Kudineer , a Siddha multi -ingredient formulation was also evaluated for its therapeutic efficacy in COVID -19 through molecular docking, pre -clinical and clinical studies. The nine phyto - constituents in this formulation showed highest binding affinity with SARS -CoV-2spike protein in the molecular docking studies. This formulation also demonstrated in -vitro immune - modulatory and thrombolytic activity. Kabasura Kudineer (KSK) also showed inhibition of virus replication similar to standard drug Remdesivir in t he in -vitro study. 16 Kabasura kudineer as prophylaxis provided effective protection to high -risk population exposed to COVID -19 in containment zones. Further, KSK when given as add -on to standard of care in asymptomatic and mild COVID -19 patients showed accelerated recovery, significant reduction in the viral load and lesser mortality rate compared to the standard care. Hence, with its preclinical and clinical evidences, Kabasura Kudineer shows promising effect in mitigation of COVID -19 pandemic. The tangible evidence generated through robust studies conducted by AYUSH -CSIR collaboration and Research Councils/National Institutes under the Ministry of Ayush, led to positioning of AYUSH - 64/Kabasura Kudineer as potential adjuncts to standard care in COVID management. To reduce the burden on the hospital -based health care delivery system during the current outbreak of COVID -19 second wave in India, the Ministry of Ayush has conducted a community -based study through its Research Councils and National institutes for mass distribution of AYUSH -64 and Kabasura Kudineer to asymptomatic, mild to moderate COVID -19 patients in home isolation. The data related to the effectiveness of AYUSH -64 and Kabasura Kudineer is also documented. The study has been completed . Overall, 96139 participants enrolled for the study (Figure 4) . Figure 4: Community -based study on Ayush Interventions for management of COVID -19 AYUSH for addressing global challenge The contribution of the Ayush systems in maintaining health and improving immunity during the COVID -19 pandemic is well accepted. Proactive initiatives, inter -departmental/inter -ministerial successful co -ordination and conduct of integrative researches, active participation of the private and public stakeholders in effective implementation of initiatives, and widespread acceptance of Ayush measures by general public largely helped in combating this crisis. The Ministry of AYUSH is committed for evidence -based integration of Ayush systems and modern medicine to address the public health challenge. The carnage evoked by this pandemic has not only demonstrated the role of AYUSH in managing the disease but also instilled the need to focus on wellness and preventive care wherein AYUSH systems can contribute significantly. 6464231497 0 20000 40000 60000 80000Ayush-64Kabasura Kudineer No. of participants 17 Research studies on COVID -19 undertaken by Research Councils and National Institutes under Ministry of Ayush Number of COVID -19 related studies - 139 Prophylactic studies - 44 Interventional studies - 44 Observational studies - 15 Pre-clinical/experimental studies - 22 (including 13 AYUSH -DBT studies) Systematic Review - 02 Other studies - 12 (08 Survey studies; 02 Monographs preparation) Study Sites - More than 150 (including pre-clinical study centers) Studies Completed - 102 AYUSH System -wise Ayurveda - 70 Homeopathy - 29 Siddha - 13 Unani - 08 Yoga & Naturopathy - 19 18Initiatives taken by MoA for COVID- 19 at a glanceGuidelines and Public Health AdvisoriesMobilization of Human Resource Research and Development (R&D)National Clinical Management Protocol Nation -wide campaign for AYUSH -64/ of Ayush Initiatives For COVID -19 19Public health advisories, guidelines and protocols issued by Ministry of Ayush During the outbreak of COVID -19 in 2020: Ayurveda Preventive Measures for self -care during COVID -19 Pandemic Self-care guidelines forprevention and immunity w.s.r.to respiratory health Telemedicine Practice Guidelines Guidelines for Ayurveda Practitioners for COVID -19 Patients During the resurgence of COVID 19 in 2021: Ayurveda Preventive Measures forself-care during COVID -19 Pandemic (Revised Advisory ) Guidelines forAyurveda Practitioners forCOVID -19Patients in Home (CCRYN, COVID -19 Information forHomeopathy and Ayurveda Practitioners on Mucormycosis Home care guidelines andAdvisory Practitioners about 20More thaneight lakhAyush doctors, paramedic staff, andstudents offered their services fortheclinical management, surveillance, and management ofCOVID isolation centres and quarantine wards byenlisting themselves asCOVID warriors onthe government portal .Details oftrained Ayush personnel were made available atState/District administration and they have been utilized inthefight against COVID -19asandwhen required .

The MoA developed a mobile app, called AYUSH Sanji vani, to document the trends of the use of AYUSH-based traditional and holistic measures by the public across India. Analysis of the data generated through this app can help monitor the extent of the use of AYUSH measures for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic and aid effective health promotion and communication efforts focused on targeted health care delivery during the pandemic. Objecti ve: The purpose of the study was to determine the extent of use of AYUSH measures by the public in India for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic as reported through the AYUSH Sanji vani mobile app. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the data generated through the Ayush Sanji vani app from May 4 to July 31, 2020, was performed to study the pattern and extent of the use of AYUSH-based measures by the Indian population. The responses of the respondents in terms of demographic profile, use pattern, and benef its obtained; the association between the use of AYUSH-based measures and symptomatic status; and the association between the duration of use of AYUSH-based measures and the outcome of COVID-19 testing were evaluated based on bivariate and multi variate logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 723,459 respondents were used for the analysis, among whom 616,295 (85.2%) reported that they had been using AYUSH measures for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these 616,295 users, 553,801 (89.8%) either strongly or moderately agreed to have benef itted from AYUSH measures. Ayurveda and homeopathic measures and interv entions were the most preferred by the respondents across India. Among the 359,785 AYUSH users who described their overall impro vement in general health, 144,927 (40.3%) rated it as good, 30,848 (8.6%) as moderate, and 133,046 (40.3%) as slight. Respondents who had been using AYUSH measures for less than 30 days were more likely to be COVID-19-positi ve JMIRx Med 2021 | vol. 2 | iss. 2 | e25703 | p. 1 https://xmed.jmir .org/2021/2/e25703 (page number not for citation purposes)Srikanth et al JMIRx Med XSLFO RenderX585858among those who were tested (odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.44-1.60). The odds of nonusers of AYUSH measures being symptomatic if they tested positi ve were greater than those of AYUSH users (odds ratio 4.01, 95% CI 3.61-4.59). Conclusions: The findings of this cross-sectional analysis assert that a large proportion of the representati ve population practiced AYUSH measures across different geographic locations of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic and benef itted considerably in terms of general well-being, with a possible impact on their quality of life and specif ic domains of Corona viruses, a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses, can infect animals and humans, causing respiratory , gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [1]. To date, 6 human corona viruses (HCoVs) have been identif ied, including the alpha corona viruses HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta corona viruses HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) [2]. New corona viruses appear to emer ge periodically in humans owing to the high prevalence and wide distrib ution of corona viruses, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes, and the increase of human-animal interf ace activities [3]. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on January 31, 2020 [4]. The World Health Organization observ ed that with appropriate integration, traditional medicine would be a signif icant option to balance curati ve services with preventive care, which can help address the unique health challenges of the 21st century [5]. Clinical evidence from a study on the effects of Chinese traditional medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV -2 demonstrated signif icant results, and the study proposed that herbal medicine has a benef icial effect in the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases [6]. A Cochrane systematic review in this area reported that herbal medicine combined with western medicine may impro ve symptoms and quality of life in SARS-CoV patients [7]. The National Health Commission in China has declared the use of herbal medicine combined with contemporary medicine as a treatment for COVID-19 and has issued many guidelines on herbal medicine-related therap y [8]. The acron ym AYUSH stands and naturopath y, Unani, Siddha, and homeopath y; these indigenous systems of medicine are practiced in India under the Ministry of AYUSH (MoA). Considering the present scenario and penetration of the AYUSH system into the mainstream health care system in India for preventive and curati ve purposes, the MoA released an advisory to the public for maintenance of general health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic on March 6, 2020 [9]. Although India is a country that follows a pluralistic approach to health care, data regarding the use of traditional systems of medicine or health-seeking trends of people are not available in the public domain. There are reports in the press regarding the use of AYUSH proph ylactic measures for COVID-19 [10] as well as for lifestyle and other diseases; however, the extent of their use and the outcomes and benef its obtained are not known. Health care delivery, as well as researchin times of natural disasters and epidemics or pandemics, is challenging [11]. The concept of infodemiology has evolved signif icantly with the ever-increasing penetration of the internet in society and is being efficiently being used to nowcast epidemics, quantify the different trends in epidemics, and document and synthesize data on the use of health care services and other public health-related issues [12,13]. The government of India has taken the initiati ve to use and integrate the preventive, curati ve, and rehabilitati ve potential of AYUSH systems of medicine to strengthen the health care delivery system, and the AYUSH Sanji vani app was developed through a consultati ve process among experts in the field of AYUSH and information technology (IT) by the MoA to record the patterns and trends of the use of preventive measures adopted by the public to enhance immunity and maintain health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The AYUSH Sanji vani app was intended to motivate and persuade users to achie ve a status of health y well-being while thwarting the tendenc y of the masses to use untested and unpro ven remedies or over-the-counter or self-prescription measures, especially when faced with the threat of the pandemic and the physical, physiological, social and economic ramif ications of the containment measures required of the public. Through recent initiati ves in smart devices, mobile apps have become a convenient, easy-to-use, and less time-consuming method to generate data from the public. Self-reported health status and health care service use are indispensable indicators to assess the performance and attitude of any health system in the absence of recorded health administration data [14]. An app-based survey has advantages such as wider population access, better response rates, lower cost, ease of analysis, ease of use for participants, assurance of user anon ymity and preferences, greater flexibility , and faster data synthesis compared to traditional epidemiological and surveillance methods. Various previous research studies in the field of mobile-based health apps and the adoption of information technology have identif ied individual preferences and motivations to use these apps based on socioeconomic characteristics, demographics, access to health care facilities, perceptions about the usefulness of the apps, and the effect of existing or percei ved disease conditions [15-18]. Hence, a cross-sectional analysis of the data generated from the app was performed to determine use trends of AYUSH measures by the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objecti ve of the cross-sectional analysis was to determine the extent of use of AYUSH advocacies and measures JMIRx Med 2021 | vol. 2 | iss. 2 | e25703 | p. 2 https://xmed.jmir .org/2021/2/e25703 (page number not for citation purposes)Srikanth et al JMIRx Med XSLFO RenderX595959Original Research Article (Experimental) In silico evaluation of the compounds of the ayurvedic drug, AYUSH- 64, for the action against Colony, Gaddiannaram, Hyderabad, 500036, Telangana State, India bNIN-TATA Centre for Excellence in Public Health Nutrition, ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, 500007, Telangana State, India cNutrition Information, Communication Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, 500007, India Anandilal Podar Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai, India fCCRAS-Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Gwalior, India gCCRAS-Regional Ayurveda Institute for Fundamental Research, Pune, India hCentral Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi, India article info Article history: Received 23 December 2020Received in revised form 12 January 2021 Accepted 17 February online xxx Keywords: COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2AYUSH-64Main proteaseMolecular dockingDynamics simulationsabstract Background: Outbreak of Corona Virus Disease in late 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic global Public health emergency.

Abstract After declaration of Covid - 19 as pandemic by WHO, countries adopted several measures to contain the spread as well as test and treat the patients. Further, as no effective management protocols to address this pandemic were available, a need was felt to explore the integration of modern and traditional medicines to treat Covid 19 cases. In view of this an exploratory nonrandomized prospective study has been undertaken for comparing the outcomes of traditional Ayurvedic classical formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) as an add on to standard of care (SOC) using modern medicine with SOC alone. This has been done in mild and moderate Covid - 19 cases, at a tertiary care integrative Medicine hospital in the National Capital Region, Gurgaon, India.Try out PMC Labs and tell us what you think.

Findings of present study reveals that the Ayurveda add-on formulation of Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Piper longum (Pippali) has reduced the length of hospital stay and improve the recovery time. General feeling of wellbeing and activity levels were better in the 3 month follow-up post discharge in the Ayurveda add-on group. It is suggested that this formulation needs further investigated to provide more information on effective and safe herbal add-on to SOC for better outcomes to treatment of COVID-19 disease.

Ayurveda has potential and possibilities to be employed both for prevention and treatment of COVID- 19. Ayurvedic texts have proposed models to predict outbreaks and propagation of epidemics as well as general guidelines for prevention and management of epidemics. The Susruta Samhita, one of the classical text books of Ayurveda has described the possibility of epidemic outbreaks of severe respiratory illnesses exhibiting a spectrum of symptoms like cough, breathing difficulties, fever, headache, running nose and even anosmia (which is a symptom that has been reported in a subset of COVID-19 patients) (). An Ayurvedic assessment of the disease can help to classify the clinical presentations of COVID-19 on the basis of the Tridoa (three dosa which are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) which forms the framework and logic around which Ayurveda understands disease and health. The standard methodology of deciphering the dosa base of the pathology through signs and symptoms using the algorithm of Ayurveda logic is equally applicable in understanding the disease spectrum of COVID-19 infection ().

By the beginning of 2021, over 100-million cases and more than two-million deaths had been reported worldwide. 1 The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found to be both highly contagious and 5-to-50-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza, with an estimated mortality rate of 0.5-5%. 2 Interventions to prevent COVID-19 are urgently needed. Healthcare workers (HCW), people involved in essential services, and relatives of patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk due to the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Preventive options such as social distancing, hand washing, and wearing masks are suggested and used to reduce the risk of the infection. Additionally, use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) chemoprophylaxis, which not only has limited ABSTRACTContext SARS-CoV-2 is a global public-health concern. Interventions to prevent infection are urgently needed. The anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of neem make it a potential agent for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Objective The study intended to evaluate the prophylactic effects of neem capsules for persons at high risk of COVID-19 infection due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. Design The research team designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. Setting The study was conducted at a single center in India.Participants Participants were 190 healthcare workers at the hospital or relatives of patients with COVID-19 infection. Intervention Of the 190 participants, 95 were in the intervention group and 95 in the control group. Participants received 50 mg of a proprietary, patent-pending, neem-leaf extract or a placebo orally in capsules, twice a day for 28 days. Outcome Measures The number of individuals positive for COVID-19 between baseline and follow-up on day 56 was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures included an evaluation of neem's safety and its effects on quality of life (QOL) and changes in biomarkers.Results The mean age of participants was 36.97 years, and 68.42% were male. Total 13 subjects tested positive during the study. All were asymptomatic. Of the 154 participants who completed the study per-protocol , 11 tested positive, 3 in the intervention group and 8 in the control group. The probability of COVID-19 infection in participants receiving the intervention was 0.45 times that of participants receiving the placebo, a relative risk of 0.45, with the effectiveness of the intervention being around 55%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in both groups were minimal and were of grade 1 or 2 in severity. Biomarkers and QOL remained stable in both groups. Conclusions The study found a reduced risk of COVID-19 infection in participants receiving neem capsules, which demonstrates its potential as a prophylactic treatment for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. The findings warrant further investigation in clinical trials. (Altern Ther Health Med.

Introduction The novel Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona- Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [ 1]. COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic disease by WHO which has severely affected the liveli- hood of the population. SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the conti- nents, as of April 11, 2020, has led to a total of 16,99,676 cases with amortality of 1,02,734 among the registered cases. Presently,quarantine and symptomatic treatment protocol for disease man- agement exists and there are no speci c antiviral drugs available to combat this virus. As per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, in India there are 7447 Active cases and 239 deaths as on April 11, 2020; these data commensurate the impending risk facing the country. This pandemic is still ongoing, hence there is an urgent need to nd new preventive and therapeutic agents as soon as possible [ 2]. Knowledge of Microbes and their Disease spread is clearly mentioned in Siddha which is evinced by \"Kirumiyal vandha thodam perugavundu lines mentioned in Guru naadi \"[3]. Siddha holistic approach will be helpful in combating COVID 19 using both ther- apeutic and non-therapeutic interventions. Siddhar's have advised evidence based treatment approach to understand a disease ( Noi naadi ), its etiology ( Vainaadi ). As per basic Siddha Concept, Siddhar*Corresponding author.

Natarajan1*, C. Anbarasi1, P. Sathiyarajeswaran1, K. Kanakavalli6and P. Balaji3 Abstract Objectives: The primary objectives of this study are to determine efficacy of Siddha medicine, Kabasura kudineer in reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and reducing the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic COVID-19 when compared to Vitamin C and Zinc (CZ) supplementation. In addition, the trial will examine the changes in the immunological markers of the Siddha medicine against control. The secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety of the Siddha medicine and to document clinical profile of asymptomatic COVID-19 as per principles of Siddha system of Medicine. Trial design: A single centre, open-label, parallel group (1:1 allocation ratio), exploratory randomized controlled trial. Participants: Cases admitted at non-hospital settings designated as COVID Care Centre and managed by the State Government Stanley Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India will be recruited. Eligible participants will be those tested positive for COVID-19 by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) aged 18 to 55 years without any symptoms and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and bronchial asthma. Those pregnant or lactating, with severe respiratory disease, already participating in COVID trials and with severe illness like malignancy will be excluded. Intervention and comparator: Adopting traditional methods, decoction of Kabasura kudineer will be prepared by boiling 5g of KSK powder in 240 ml water and reduced to one-fourth (60ml) and filtered. The KSK group will receive a dose of 60ml decoction, orally in the morning and evening after food for 14 days. The control group will receive Vitamin C (60000 IU) and Zinc tablets (100mg) orally in the morning and evening respectively for 14 days.

Conventional care included Vitamin-c, Azithromycin, and Paracetamol. Ayurveda formulations used as add-on along Sanshamani tablet, AYUSH-64 tablet AND Yastimadhu Ghana tablet for oral administration. Considering Add-on Ayurveda medicines as exposure of interest, patients who received Add-on Ayurveda medicines at least for 7 days were included in the exposed group while those who received only conventional care in unexposed group. Data was collected through record review and telephonic interviews. The outcomes of interest were the development of symptoms, duration of symptomatic phase in those progressing to symptomatic stage and mortality. Total 762 participants were included-[541 (71%) in the exposed group and 221 (29%) in the unexposed. Progression to symptomatic phase did not differ significantly between groups [27.6% in exposed, 24.6% in unexposed, adjusted RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.6-1.2]. The total duration of symptomatic phase among those progressing to the symptomatic stage was significantly decreased in the exposed group (x/C22\u00bc3.66+1.55 days in exposed (n \u00bc133); x/C22\u00bc5.34+3.35 days in unexposed (n \u00bc61), p < 0.001). No mortality was observed in either of the groups. Ayurveda Treatment as adjunctive to conventional care reduced the duration of symptomatic phase in early stage COVID-19 as compared to standalone conventional care. Add-on Ayurveda treatment has promising potential for management of early stage COVID-19. Keywords Ayurveda, COVID-19, cohort study, complementary medicine, SARS-CoV-2 Received January 20, 2021.

INTRODUCTION Following the first -ever reported case in Wuhan in December 2019, PHEI (Public Health Emergency of International concern) was announced by WHO in January [1]. SARS -CoV -2 has spread widely across all continents; as of the latest situation report on August 16, 2020, by WHO, a total of 21, 294, 845 cases with mortality of 7,61, 779 have been reported [2]. There are 2 647 316 cases in India and 51,045 deaths as of August 16, 2020; these data represent the imminent risk facing the country [3]. India declared an emergency alert in March 2020. Transmission of virus spreads via physical contact with infected individuals, contaminated surfaces, and droplets [4]. COVID -19 commonly reported symptoms are fever, vomiting, chills, headache, dyspnoea, nausea, sore throat, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, myalgia, diarrhea, and malaise. The severe infection leads to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sometimes multi -organ failures such as kidney failure and even death [5]. With its strong inte rnal and external medications, the linage of Siddha medicine has been in vogue to treat viral diseases [6]. At Present, treatment aspects are isolation and treating symptoms stands as the only option or vaccine therapy Due to the non-availability of proved therapies . Therefore, it is necessary to develop a treatment for COVID -19. Based on the Siddha system of Medicine advisory given by the Ministry of AYUSH, India for COVID -19 mentioned stages of medicines for treatment , prophylaxis, and related convalescence. Kabasura Kudineer (KSK) found its the the Minist ry of AYUSH [7]. The Tamilnadu government advocates zinc and Vitamin c.

Introduction On 31st December 2019, 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology were recognized in Wuhan City, Hubei area in China. The causative organism was recognized from throat swab tests led by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) on seventh January 2020, and was along these lines named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) named this infection as COVID-19. On 30th January 2020, the WHO proclaimed the Chinese episode of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern representing a high hazard to nations with weak wellbeing frameworks (1). As of 27 July 2020, following data has been reported throughout the world, India & Tamil Nadu. More than 16.4 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 6,46,641 deaths. More than 9.51 million people have recovered (2). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has confirmed a total of 14,35,453 cases, 9,17,567 recoveries (including 1 migration) and 32771 deaths in India. The Department of Health and Family Welfare of Tamil Nadu has confirmed a total of 2,13,723 cases, including 3493 deaths and 1,56,526 recoveries. Around 53703 active cases are reported (3). The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes innovations around the world including repurposing drugs, traditional medicines and developing new therapies in the search for potential treatments for COVID-19 (4). In China, traditional Chinese medicine is very useful to control and prevention and treatment for COVID 19 patients. In integrated approach is very success full treatment in COVID 19 patients in china (5). Among six recognized streams of Indian Medicine System, Siddha medicine is one such traditional medicine originating in Tamil Nadu, India and practiced over centuries (6). Siddha system of medicine has played a major role in treating the diseases such as dengue, chikungunya. Both the TN Govt and union ministry of AYUSH has recommended an herbal siddha medicine called Nilavembu Kudineer a s a treatment for dengue (7).

The overburden of the disease is due to the vicious circulating virus characteristics, lack of potent vaccine, complications and limitations of the existing medicine and aggravation of disease along with comorbid conditions in elderly people, etc. In the present scenario, effective traditional treatment modalities should be scientifically applied to reduce the impact of massive disaster. Here is the necessity to develop an appropriate treatment protocol from the field of Ayurveda. This is a documentation of three confirmed COVID19 cases managed with Ayurvedic medication with minimum number of hospital stay compared with the national average. Ayurvedic management has a significant positive impact on the mental and physical quality of life in COVID19 patients. Both the physical and mental scores got improved of more than 50% percentage in each case after treatment. Ayurvedic science has a unique approach to COVID 19 and can be adopted wisely to overcome the current crisis. Marked radiological changes were observed in three cases. Ayurvedic interventions can be used to counteract the pathogenesis of SARS CoV2. KEYWORDS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, COVID19, SARSCoV2 INTRODUCTION The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) caused significant morbidity and mortality, finally led to an emergency of major international concern.[1] The virus has created an unfavorable socioeconomic impact globally. The initial clusters of cases were reported in December 2019 at Wuhan. The current testimonies indicate that SARS- CoV-2 spread to humans through transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.[2] On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus (2019nCoV), and the disease was later named as COVID- 19 by the WHO.[3] The COVID- 19 has spread across the world at a vicious pace, gripping more than 218 countries, 16 lakh deaths, and more than 20 million active cases in the mid of December.[4] Compared with other viral diseases, the hallmark of the novel coronavirus is the wide range of disease severity experienced by the patients. Only a minority of COVID19 patients require hospitalization, the effects of infection for these people are dramatic, in some l ife threatening cases. Infection with SARS- CoV-2 causes severe pneumonia, intermittent fever, and cough. Symptoms of rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, and sneezing have been less commonly observed. Patients often develop acute respiratory distress syndrome within t wo days of hospital admission, requiring ventilatory support. It has been observed that during this phase, the mortality tends to be high. For this infectious pathology, there is no specific proven treatment Address for correspondence: Dr. P . S.

It includes a spectrum of clinical severity extended from asymptomatic to critical pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. Recent evidences have suggested that inflammatory responses play a critical role in the progression of COVID19. Inflammatory markers such as Creactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, DDIMER have been reported to be significantly associated with the high risks of the development of severe COVID19. In this context, two cases diagnosed with COVID19 were managed through Ayurvedic intervention is presented here. The patients of moderate COVID19 were recovered from the symptoms with the personalized holistic treatment approaches.

Coronavirus disease 2019, also called COVID- 19, a global pandemic resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.[1] According to experts, not only the health but also other integral sectors of economy were highly affected, disrupting our life styles. Currently, we are living a new normal life style. Till date, lack of effective management strategy, complications and limitations of the existing medicines, aggravation of disease along with comorbid conditions in elderly people, etc., are add on burden to the pandemic. Accumulating evidences have suggested that inflammatory responses play a critical role in the progression of COVID -19.[2] Inflammatory responses triggered by rapid viral replication of SARS- CoV-2 and cellular destruction can recruit macrophages and monocytes and induce the release of cytokines and chemokines. These cytokines and chemokines then attract immune cells and activate immune responses, leading to cytokine storms and further exacerbations of situations. Several inflammatory markers have some tracing and detecting accuracy for disease severity and fatality. The Ministry of AYUSH has set up an Interdisciplinary Committee for Integration of Ayurveda and Yoga interventions and released \"National Clinical Management Protocol to combat COVID-19\" specially focusing on mild- to-moderate cases.[3] The selection of these drugs is based on published scientific evidence, literary research supported by scientific relevance and rationale in support of repurposing of these medicines in COVID-19 and outcomes and trends of completed and ongoing studies taken up by the Ministry of AYUSH on a large cohort across India. Even though it is said to be a new disease entity to world, it is not beyond the fundamental Tridosha sidhanta of Ayurveda.[4] The current Address for correspondence: Dr. Raja Ram Mahto, Department of Kayachikitsa, All India Institute of India Institute of Ayurveda, New Delhi, IndiaAccess this article online Quick Response Code: Website: www.ayucare.org A, Dileep A, Shukla A, Gauri A.

A 3 9 year old female Covid positive patient is presented here under who was introduced with th e combined therapy of Siddha and biomedicine along with dietary advice and standard quarantine care. The subject had all the peculiar clinical features of Covid 19. Nilavembu kudineer (NVK) was administered twice daily at the dose of 60 ml along with the prescribed biomedicine . Qualitative SARS -COV -2 RT -PCR test was used as the confirmatory test for Covid 19 along with basic haematological and biochemical parameters. After the initiation of integrative medicine, the subject showed improvement symptomaticall y and gradual disappearance of symptoms with out adverse effects. RT -PCR after 14 days of therapy reported negative and the subject was greatly relieved.

Worldwide, researchers and clinicians are struggling with this crisis. The pandemic has accentuated the need to strengthen health systems and accelerate research and development (R &D) programmes. The Ministry of Health and Fam- ily Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India took rapid measures in the control, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 by issuing several advisories and guidelines. A well-organized public health and hygiene awareness campaign promoting use of mask, physical distancing, hand-washing as well as effective sanitization, lock- downs, quarantine and epidemiological monitoring has immensely helped in controlling the disease spread, and reducing themorbidity and mortality as compared to several other countries. One more possible cause for lower rates of morbidity and mortality in India could be the use of immunity promoting interventions from the ancient traditional systems of medicine involving Ayur- and several home remedies based on traditional knowledge. Admittedly, strengths of modern medicine in managing the symptomatic treatment and critical care of COVID-19 have helped tremendously. However, modern medicine has limitations in providing a better immunological and mental status for effective prophylaxis and prevention as well as promoting well-being with improved quality of life. The approach of AYUSH systems for strengthening host defence may be useful as an effective, safer, accessible, and affordable prophylaxis in management of COVID- 19. Hence, use of AYUSH systems has increased globally during the pandemic. The Ministry of AYUSH (MoA), Government of India has under- taken several R &D and public health initiatives to harness the po- tential of AYUSH systems to contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives aim at creating public awareness regarding measures to improve immunity and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. They also provide guidelines to AYUSH stake- holders to address this pandemic scenario effectively. The year 2020 has been a challenging period that made the healthcare re- searchers and stakeholders wiser than before [ 1]. An overview of the experiences, challenges, and success stories of the MoA during the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this editorial. 1. Guidelines and advisories The MoA issued various guidelines and advisories to improve immunity and advised simple home remedies easily accessible to the general public. It also recommended a set of self-care guidelinesduly vetted by eminent Ayurveda experts for preventive health measures, with special reference to respiratory health and enhancing immunity. The treatment recommended by the practitioners of AYUSH sys- tems may vary across the country. However, in times of a public health emergency like COVID-19, it is essential to have a consider- able degree of uniformity in the management of the disease. Hence, guidelines for registered practitioners of respective AYUSH systems were prepared by the MoA through concerned team of experts to address the issue [ 2]. Considering the urgent need for delivering healthcare services to the public during lockdown period, the Min- istry also published 'Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 'for AYUSH practitioners. The Ministry also issued an order to prevent dissem- ination of misleading information about AYUSH interventions and advertising claims for COVID-19. Apart from guidelines and advisories, the MoA also launched campaigns such as 'AYUSH for Immunity 'to disseminate the health promotion messages in the general public and set-up an AYUSH COVID-19 Dashboard to furnish the details of guidelines related to AYUSH measures for improving immunity, of cial communica- tions, research undertaken on COVID-19, measures for prophylaxis and management. The National Repository on AYUSH COVID-19 clinical and other R &D initiatives have been developed to dissemi- nate information related to AYUSH R &D initiatives, COVID-19 related AYUSH clinical trials and scienti c publications and is avail- able on the AYUSH Research Portal of the MoA. The efforts by the MoA led to a cascade effect and several State Governments issued guidelines regarding prophylaxis and man- agement of asymptomatic and mild cases through AYUSH modal- ities and conduction of research studies on COVID-19. The MoA also issued directives to all State/UT licensing authorities and drug controllers of AYUSH to expedite the process of approval/li- cense/license renewal for manufacturing of ASU immunity-boosting healthcare products and sanitizers. 2. Mobilization of human resources The MoA envisioned maximum stakeholder mobilization and encouraged the AYUSH institutes across the country for optimum utilization of available infrastructure and staff to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, several AYUSH hospitals in different regions of the country were designated as quarantine and COVID care centres by the respective State Governments. The Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi also addressed the AYUSH stakeholders to provide their services in this crisis situ- ation.

Ltd. A-12, 2nd Floor, Sector 2, Noida-201301 UP, IndiaThere is ample evidence and expanding coverage on the COVID-19 virus spread across the world today. The increasing burden of cases has not only overwhelmed our fragile public health care system but also stressed our economy due to lock- downs. The last one year of the pandemic has subjected our health care systems, social support systems, and resilience of our citizens to testing times, as a result of antipandemic mea - sures. Evidence-based treatment guidelines have been formu- lated, revised, and advocated by both Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of AYUSH in the last one year for health care practitioners to treat COVID-19 patients. There has been a clamor for improving one's \"immunity\" and being healthy and fit to reduce the impact of COVID-19. While the COVID-19 may infect anybody, the predilection, severity of symptoms, and ability to resist virus infection does depend on physiological and psychological status of one's health. This is evident from epidemiological characteristics of this disease severely affecting the elderly and those with comor- bid conditions. Although the evidence for role of a healthy lifestyle as a primary prevention of COVID is still uncertain, it nevertheless is known to influence the trajectory of the dis - ease in those affected. Yoga and meditation as a mind, body and lifestyle intervention has gained popularity in recent times. Ever since the declaration of International Day of Yoga (June 21) by the United Nations General Assembly in 2014, yoga, as a health promotion intervention, has gained popu- larity globally with due support from majority of the nations and the World Health Organization (WHO). The present edi - torial highlights the role of yoga in prevention and manage - ment of COVID and COVID-like acute respiratory illnesses. The resurgence of COVID-19 in 2021 has enhanced the burden on the health care resources in our country, with an exponential increase in the number of cases. The highlight- ing of deaths due to lack of oxygen beds by the media has created a panic in the country. People are more anxious than ever before if they have contracted COVID due to uncertainty in trajectory and ensuing respiratory distress. It has become impossible under these circumstances to pay attention to and mitigate the psychological distress of every patient who is under home isolation or under hospitalization. The accom - panying psychological distress in COVID-19 patients is often ignored and not managed. There have been reports of anxiety and acute depression, leading to suicides during home isola- tion and in COVID care hospitals. Social isolation has led to anxiety and led to severe mental health issues in those with preexisting anxiety or depressive disorders. The constant fear of getting infection, unbearable stress, long working hours, helplessness, and distress watching infected patients die alone has caused burnout stress in frontline health care workers. All these point to a pandemic of psychological dis - tress accompanying COVID-19.1 COVID-19 patients have had to contend with stress due to fear of worsening of symptoms, respiratory distress, hypoxia, fatigue, insomnia, and other symptoms during COVID-19 infection, which are amplified due to isolation anxiety.2 The anxiety and uncertainty about the trajectory and course of illness among COVID-19 positive patients, those suspected of COVID-19, and those in quarantine can lead to psychologic distress which, in turn, can downregu- late their immune defenses and increase the chance and severity of infection, similar to earlier studies. Studies have shown psychological stress to enhance the rates of infection in communities during a flu season. Even among the health care workers, impending anxiety and stress can downregu- late immune responses and defenses that can lead them to contract this infection and increase its severity.3 Treatment protocols for people with COVID-19 should address both the physiological and psychological needs of the patients and health service providers.

Aim: The present clinical study was conducted to evaluate Chyawanprash for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Materials & Methods: It was an Open-label, Multicentric, Randomized, Comparative, Prospective, and Interventional Community-based Clinical Study. The study was conducted at five sites across Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan between May 2020 and November 2020. Materials and Methods: A total of 771 subjects were screened in the study; of whom, 721 subjects were randomized into two groups. Subjects in the DCP group who fell into the category of 13 years to 70 years were given Chyawanprash as a study intervention to be taken in a dose of one teaspoonful (approx. 12 g) twice daily and children aged 5 to 12 years were given \u00bd teaspoonful (approx. 6 g) twice daily followed by a cup of milk (approx. 200 mL). Subjects in the control group were advised to consume one cup of milk (approx. 200 mL) twice daily. The incidence of COVID-19 was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/antigen testing, which was conducted as per applicable guidelines and the severity of infection was assessed by using the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale. The incidence and severity of non-COVID-19 infections was also assessed during the intervention period of 90 days. Results: Overall, 696 subjects completed the study, of whom 351 subjects were in the Chyawanprash (DCP) group and 345 were in the control group. In the DCP group, out of the 351 subjects who had completed the study, 42 were tested with RT-PCR/antigen and one subject was found to be positive for COVID-19. In the control group, out of the 345 subjects, 28 were tested with RT-PCR/Antigen and eight subjects were found to be positive for COVD-19. In the DCP group, the incidence was statistically significant lesser as compared with the control group. A total of 43 subjects in the control group and 41 subjects in the DCP group had symptoms of Influenza Like Illness (ILI). The DCP group also showed a statistically significant improvement in quality of life (QoL), as assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) when compared with the control group. Conclusion: The outcome of the present study suggests and supports the prophylaxis potential of Chyawanprash as one of the preventive remedies for COVID-19 as recommended by the AYUSH fraternity. The beneficial effects may be due to the synergistic effects of the potent herbs that are known to have immune-boosting effects in healthy individuals.

To evaluate the general physical and mental health benefits of Ashwagandha. Methods: A 16 week randomized prospective, open-label, parallel efficacy, two arm, multi-centre study. The primary efficacy measure was 'failure of prophylaxis ' as confirmed COVID-19 by quantitative Reverse Tran- scription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at any time during the study period. This study on 400 partici - pants from three centres was designed to establish non-inferiority for WS to HCQ for prophylaxis against COVID- 19 at 80 % power and significance p D0.025, one-sided. The interim analysis was carried out on 160 participants after completion of 8 weeks. Results: Participants in both the arms were well-matched at the baseline characteristics. Forty participants in the HCQ group and 26 participants in the WS group reported mild AE. The symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were found to be 3.7 % (95 % CI 1.3-10.5 %) in the HCQ and 1.3 % (95 % CI 0.02 -6.7 %) in the WS arm amongst the first 160 participants completing 8 weeks. Conclusion: Our intent was to explore a safer option to HCQ. We report that WS was not found inferior to HCQ and its efficacy was within the 15 % non-inferiority margin set a priori . WS as an immunomodulator has other clinical benefits including reducing mental stress. The final report of this study is expected by end of August 2021. 1.Introduction A large number of health care workers (HCW) engaged in combatting COVID-19 have fallen prey to the virus. This is despite extensive use of personal protection equipment, strict personal discipline and other preventive measures such as social distancing, use of face mask, hand - washing, and use of drugs like hydroxychloroquine HCQ as prophylactic agents. Chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 is needed; however, there are no proven drugs yet. This study was initiated when vaccines were not available in India. Earlier studies have shown that HCQ was Withania somnifera (WS); health care workers Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). . 2 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi, India. 3 covid19publicationpmu@gmail.com . 4AYUSH CCRAS Research Group (ACRG) includes following clinical and coordinators: Ashwinikumar Raut, Research Centre, Kas- turba Health Mumbai, India; Muffazal Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research BCS Raob; Shruti Khandurib; Sanjay Tamboli, Manjit Sanjeev Sarmukkaddama; Girish Tilluc. s{yo|kro>! \u00d0\u00d0\u00d01owot o~1m{y2w{m ko2mty! https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2021.102768 Received 6 July 2021; Received in revised form 11 August 2021; Accepted 12 August 2021 818181Ahmed et al Journal http://jddtonline.info Journal of Drug Delivery and Therapeutics Open Access to Pharmaceutical and Medical Research Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s): This is an open -access article distributed under the terms of the CC BY -NC 4.0 which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium for non -commercial use provided the original author and source are credited Open Access Full Text Article Research Article In-Silico Evaluation of Tiryaq -E-Wabai, an Unani Formulation for 1 Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Chennai, India 2 Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (Deemed to be University), Chennai, India 3 Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, New Delhi, M/o Ayush, Govt 06 June 2021 Reviewed 11 July 2021 Accepted 19 July 2021 Published 15 August 2021 _________________________________________ Cite this article as: Ahmed NZ, Davis GDJ, Anwar N, Khan AA, Meena RP, Afnaan Z, Sri MD, In-Silico Evaluati on of - E-Wabai , Spike Glycoprotein and Main Protease was originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has been de clared a pandemic disease by WHO. The number of infected cases continues unabated and so far, no specific drug approved for targeted therapy. Hence, there is a need for drug discovery from traditional medicine. Tiryaq -e-Wabai is a well -documented formulati on in Unani medicine for its wide use as prophylaxis during epidemics of cholera, plague and other earlier epidemic diseases. The objective of the current study is to generate in -silico evidence and evaluate the potency of Tiryaq -e-Wabai against -CoV -2 spike (S) and main protease (3CLpro). The structures of all phytocompounds used in this study were retrieved from PubChem database and some were built using Marvin Sketch.

The virus could infect human with symptoms similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syn drome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)3. SARS -CoV -2 infection has been reported across 223 countries and India has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia as per the latest reports4. The number of i nfected cases continues to soar high and effective targeted therapy options for COVID -19 remain s limited. A number of research studies are in progress to find out a potent drug to curb the grave situation. Many traditional drugs , being used for millennia in Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha systems , have been reported to possess significant antiviral activities against a wide range of viruses5. A recent study demonstrated a high binding affinity of a S iddha formulation with spike protein of SARS -CoV -26. These reports support the hypothesis that tradi tional drugs may also have a significant potential against SARS -CoV -2. Tiryaq -e-Wabai is a well -documented Unani formulation for its wide use as prophylaxis and treatment during epidemics of cholera, plague and other epidemic diseases. It is comprised of 3 ingredients, mixture of two part of Sibr, one part zafran and one part Murr Makki, remained protec ted during epidemics'11. It is stated that the use of Tiryaq -e- Wabai thrice a week on alternate days in a single dose of 500 mg, with Arq-e-Gulab 60 ml or Arq-e-Badiyan 120 ml, may protect the individual from infection during epidemics12-15. The formulatio n ingredients fall under the category of Tiryaqi Advia (literally - antidote drugs) and are considered to be very effective in SARS like conditions especially in respiratory distress7,15,16 These drugs have been reported for wide -ranging pharmacological ac tivities. The formulation has been reported to possess immune -stimulation activity in immunocompromised elderly persons17. The medicinal use of Sibr ( Aloe vera ) can be traced thousands year back in the history . It has been used for various diseases in Unan i medicine including digestive, respiratory, nervous system disorders and skin disorders. It is mentioned that the use of Sibr in any form; oral intake, fumigation, and spraying has promising effects during 828282RESEARCH Open Access Efficacy of standard allopathy treatment in the management of mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients \u2014a double-blind, aim: Globally, the ongoing pursuit in exploring an effective drug to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has not met with significant success to date. Indian traditional medicines, especially polyherbal formulations like Nilavembu of the Siddha system of medicine, have been used as public health interventions for controlling viral epidemics like dengue and Chikungunya. These traditional therapies have been found safe, effective, and widely accepted. The current study evaluates the comparative efficacy of NVK and KSK as opposed to the placebo, in the management of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Methods: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative clinical trial, with the primary objective of determining the efficacy of KSK and NVK. Patients ( n=125) diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms were enrolled in the study over a period of 4 months (Aug 2020 \u2014Dec 2020). Participants were randomized into 3 arms; placebo-decaffeinated tea in Arm I, NVK in Arm II, and KSK in Arm III. Each arm received 60 ml of the respective treatment twice a day, post morning and evening meals, along with standard allopathy treatment for a maximum of 10 days. The main outcome measures of the study were the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, hospital stay, and time taken by the patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic.

Trials (2021) 22:570 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05478-0 838383included clinical symptoms (fever, cough, and breathlessness) each day and real-time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), and electrolytes and electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline (day 0) and days 3, 6, and 10. Post-treatment, participants were followed up for 30 days via phone for adverse effects if any. Effects of drugs on inflammatory markers (IL6) at the end of treatment were also recorded. Adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study. Results: The results revealed that when compared to patients in the placebo arm, those in NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and the time taken to become symptomatic from asymptomatic. Out of 125 COVID-19 patients recruited, 120 completed the study; two from the placebo group developed severe symptoms and were shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and three patients from Arms II and III withdrew from the study. The mean age of females ( n=60) and males ( n=60) enrolled was between 40.2 and 44.3 years, respectively. Results were more promising for all the patients in NVK and KSK arms as all enrolled participants (100%) under this group got discharged by day 6 as compared to only 42.5% (n=17) from the placebo group on that day. The hospital stay time for patients in Arm I was significantly longer (mean [SD]=8.4 [2.0] days) as compared to the Arms II and III (mean [SD]=4.7 [1.5] and 4.2 [1.5] days, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.0001). Patients in the three groups took a significantly different number of days to become asymptomatic. While Arm II and III patients took mean of 2.5 and 1.7 days, respectively, Arm I, patients took a mean of 4.2 days (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.0001). In all, two adverse events were recorded, one for vomiting and one for diarrhea lasting a day in Arm I and Arm II, respectively. The mean value of interleukin-6 (IL6) was significantly different in comparison to the placebo-decaffeinated tea arm (NVK=2.6 and KSK=2.2, placebo=4.0, P=0.02). dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and D-dimer that were analyzed at the baseline and at the time of discharge from the hospital, were not significantly different in the three arms. Conclusion: NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and time taken for patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic, when compared to the placebo (decaffeinated tea). The primary outcome measures of the KSK arm were significantly better than those in the NVK arm. Keywords: Mild to Kudineer, Double-blinded RCT Introduction Globally, there has been an ongoing pursuit in exploring an effective treatment to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this quest across various treatment verticals has led to des- pair amongst the scientific community [ 1]. In India, the role of traditional treatments especially Siddha medi- cines in the management of various diseases is well known that has proven effective, safe, and widely ac- cepted across all ages. During the chikungunya and den- gue epidemic in the year 2015 in Tamilnadu, India, the administration of Nilavembu Kudineer (NVK) played a major role in controlling the morbidity [ 2]. Siddha medi- cine has contributed to lowering the disease burden dur- ing public health emergencies. These medicines could be repurposed for the management of COVID-19. How- ever, there is limited evidence for the integrative treat- ment approach (standard of care, allopathy treatment along with Siddha medication) in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that was firstreported in December 2019. At present, we have limited evidence from randomized clinical trials to support pharmacological treatments from conventional medicine for COVID-19 [ 3]. According to Siddha Medical Literature, the symptoms and signs of COVID-19 including cold, cough, and fever are analogous to Kaba Suram [ 4,5].Standard Siddha medicines for and Nilavembu Kudineer (NVK). NVK was one of the essential medicines used as anti-viral Siddha drugs, especially in the treatment of chikungunya and dengue during the past outbreaks [ 6]. Recent in vitro studies have revealed that ethanolic extract of NVK has anti-viral properties against chikungunya and dengue [ 2, 7]. Toxicity studies utilizing NVK as per Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines found it to be safe for consumption. Apart from this, antipyretic, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulant activities of NVK have also been proven by phytochemical screening studies [ 8]. Recent clinical studies have revealed the prophylactic and anti- viral activities of NVK in viral fevers [ 9,10]. TheseSrivastava et al.

Corresponding Author's Email : vd.psm2008@gmail.com Date of Submission : 21 Apr 2021 || Date of Acceptance: 2 Jul 2021 Abstract Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of Chyawanprash in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among health care personnel working at COVID-19 isolation ward. Setting: A hospital designated as COVID-19 care centre in Delhi, India Participants: Apparently healthy health care workers (HCWs) of age 20 to 60 years who were RT PCR negative and asymptomatic but possibly had exposure to active cases of COVID- 19, with or without co-morbid conditions were included. Pregnant and lactating females, volunteers with malignancy, uncontrolled blood sugar, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, hematological disorders, and those on immunosuppressants were excluded from the study. Interventions: Chyawanprash, an Ayurvedic rasayana medicine 12 gm orally with warm water twice daily for 30 days along with standard preventive measures adopted by the institute. Primary Outcome: Incidence of COVID-19 infection confirmed by RT-PCR test. Secondary Outcomes: Evaluation of safety of the study drug through hematological & biochemical investigations and occurrence of any adverse drug reaction or adverse events; number of participants developing any other bacterial, viral or fungal infection during the study period and changes in inflammatory and immune markers. Results: At the end of study period, out of total 50 participants enrolled, two were COVID -19 positive. Incidence rate in similar population in the same study setting prior to commencing (9.71%) and after completing the study period (1.79%) was compared with incidence of COVID-19 during treatment period (1.09%). So, Chyawanprash showed protection rate of 98.91%. It was well tolerated by all the study participants, when administered for 30 days. Conclusions: The infection rate at the hospital dropped significantly following administration of Chyawanprash. As Chyawanprash shows potential of a prophylactic agent against infection by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is safe when used in the recommended daily dosage, a randomized controlled trial to prove its prophylactic efficacy can be designed on larger sample size.

Potential therapeutic and prophylactic agents should ideally have antiviral properties against SARS-CoV -2, immunomodulatory properties, and therapeutic adjuvant activity with drugs used while being safe and tolerable.[2] Although several therapeutic interventions such as hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, and antivirals have been suggested and tried, the outcomes have not been much promising. The current medical strategy for the AYUSH64 as an addon to standard care in asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID19: A Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Nagpur, 1Department of Medicine, Government Medical College, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, 2Department of Ayurveda, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, 3Department of Biostatistics, 4Former Director General, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India Background: The evidence on the efficacy and safety of Ayurveda interventions as an addon to the standard conventional care for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is limited. Aim and objective: This study was planned to explore the potential of AYUSH-64 as an add-on to conventional care in improving the clinical recovery and negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) conversion in asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases. Materials and methods: An open-label randomized controlled study was conducted at Government Medical College, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, with a sample size of 60 participants. In this study, asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients were randomized and allocated into intervention and control groups (CG) in a 1:1 ratio. AYUSH-64 two capsules (500 mg each) were administered thrice daily, after food with water for 30 days along with standard care in the intervention group (IG), while the CG received only standard care. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who turned RT -PCR negative for COVID-19 at 7th, 15th, 22nd and 30th days. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants who attained clinical recovery at 7th, 15th, 22nd and 30th days, change in laboratory parameters on the 30th day and incidence of adverse drug reactions/adverse events. The data were compared within group using paired sample t-test/Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between group using independent sample t-test/Mann-Whitney test. Results: Statistically significant difference was not observed in the proportion of participants who turned RT -PCR negative during each of the follow-ups ( P = 0.134) and both groups demonstrated comparable efficacy. The clinical recovery in terms of complete relief in symptoms in the symptomatic participants was 60% and 37% on day 15 ( P = 0.098) and 100% and 85.2% on day 30 ( P = 0.112) in the intervention and CG, respectively. The improvement in the inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), and Ddimer was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in the IG, whereas in the CG, it was statistically significant for Ddimer only. None of the participants developed any complications nor were any significant ADR/AE observed in the groups. Conclusions: In patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19, AYUSH-64, as add-on to standard conventional care, contributed to improved clinical recovery and demonstrated potential in reducing the levels of proinflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF- . Further, both the groups demonstrated comparable efficacy regarding negative RTPCR for COVID19. Keywords: Ayurveda, AYUSH-64, 61-65, Institutional Area, Opposite D New Delhi - 110 058, India.

Thus, therapeutics aimed at inhibiting the entry of the virus or its internalization in theupper respiratory tract are of interest. Herein, we report the prophylactic application of two intranasal formulations provided by the National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB), Anu oil and til tailya, in the hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prophylactic intra-nasal instillationof these oil formulations exhibited reduced viral load in lungs and resulted in reduced bodyweight loss and lung-pneumonitis. In line with reduced viral load, histopathological analysisrevealed a reduction in lung pathology in the Anu oil group as compared to the controlinfected group. However, the til tailya group did not show a signi cant reduction in lung pathology. Furthermore, molecular analysis using mRNA expression pro ling indicated reduced expression of pro-in flammatory cytokine genes, including Th1 and Th17 cytokines for both the intranasal formulations as a result of decreased viral load.Together, the prophylactic intranasal application of Anu oil seems to be useful inlimiting both viral load and severity in SARS-CoV2 infection in the hamster model.

As of 6, of coronavirus infection incidences was 221,846,104 with around 4,586,516 deaths globally, with 441,07 5 mortalities in India alone. The majority of the coronavirus cases are asymptomatic and do not require aggressive treatment. However, an estimated 13.8%of the infected individuals are at risk of devel oping a severe form of COVID-19, which could be characterized by either one or all of the following COV ID-19 symptoms: respiratory distress, high fever, loss of taste and smell, and diarrhea ( Chen and Li, 2020 ;Wang et al., 2020 ).

A survey among Ayurveda wholesalers and retailers in Pune city for understanding the demand for Ayurvedic medicines during the COVID19 pandemic. J Indian Sys Medicine 2021;9:1915.Original Article A survey among Ayurveda wholesalers and retailers in Pune city for understanding the demand for Ayurvedic medicines during the COVID-19 Karnataka, 2Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, New Delhi, India Abstract Background: After the outbreak of Covid19, a set of guidelines for boosting immunity and selfcare measures were promoted by the Ayurveda, Y oga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha Sowa Riga, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) department. Pune has surpassed many metro cities of India and is recognized as one of the worsthit places of Covid19. Ayurveda is very popular among the citizens of Pune, but there is a lack of systematic data regarding the demand for Ayurveda products and the impact of the pandemic on the sales of Ayurveda medicines. Objective: This survey was planned to collect information from Ayurveda medicine retailers regarding the trends in the usage and demand for Ayurveda medicines among the citizens of Pune in the background of Covid19. Materials and Methods: It was a semistructured questionnairebased survey study consisting of 43 questions to assess the demand for Ayurveda medicines during the Covid19 pandemic in Pune city. The study was conducted from August 2020 to September 2020, and the respondents were selected by the convenience sampling method. Data were collected from a total of 33 respondents (retailers and wholesalers of Ayurveda medicine). Analysis: The data of the completed questionnaire were systematically summarized in Microsoft excel sheet 2007, and descriptive analysis, including percentages, was used. Result: The survey shows that certain raw herbs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera L.), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia Miers), and finished products such as AYUSH Kwatha (Formulation to be prepared as a decoction), Chyavanprasha were in high demand during the Covid19 outbreak. However, the demand for Amritarishta, Guduchi Ghana Vati, and Ashwagandha tablet was also high. Conclusion: These preliminary data of the survey study demonstrate the need for conducting similar studies in larger sample sizes across the country, which would enable the concerned authorities to frame policies. Keywords: Ayurveda medicines, AYUSH, corona, over the counter, trend IntroductIon In the wake of the Covid19 pandemic, the medical community worldwide is relentlessly working toward developing effective pharmacotherapeutics. The complexities of management of the illness tend to be limited in modern medicine, whereas the dynamic appraisal of evidence concerning the same has widened the scope of AYUSH at the national level.[1] Traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda have an equal opportunity owing to the practicebased evidencebuilding strategy.[2] The Ministry of AYUSH has taken up this opportunity to utilize the vast potential of Ayurveda, releasing a set of guidelines for boosting immunity and selfcare measures based on Ayurveda principles and resulting in a surge in the demand for Ayurvedic medicine.[3] Chyavanaprash, Sanshamani Vati (tablet), and AYUSH Kwatha (Formulation a decoction) few formulations; Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia Miers.), reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load in asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals as compared to vitamin C and zinc supplementation: findings from a prospective, exploratory, open-labeled, comparative, randomized controlled trial, Tamil Nadu, India K. Kanakavalli6and P. Balaji3 Abstract Introduction: Despite several ongoing efforts in biomedicine and traditional medicine, there are no drugs or vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as of May 2020; Kabasura Kudineer (KSK), a polyherbal formulation from India 's Siddha system of medicine, has been traditionally used for clinical presentations similar to that of COVID-19. We explored the efficacy of KSK in reducing viral load and preventing the disease progression in asymptomatic, COVID-19 cases. Methods: A prospective, single-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a COVID Care Centre in Chennai, India. We recruited reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 of 18 to 55 years of age, without clinical symptoms and co-morbidities. They were randomized (1:1 ratio) to KSK (60 mL twice daily for 7 days) or standard of care (7 days supplementation of vitamin C 60,000 IU morning daily and zinc 100 mg evening daily) groups. The primary outcomes were reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 load [as measured by cyclic threshold (CT) value of RT-PCR], prevention of progression of asymptomatic to symptomatic state, and changes in the immunity markers including interleukins (IL-6, IL-10, IL-2), interferon factor (TNF ). Siddha clinical assessment and the occurrence of adverse effects were documented as secondary outcomes. Paired t-test was used in statistical analysis. \u00a9 The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Trials (2021) 22:623 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05583-0 8989Results: Viral load in terms of the CT value (RdRp: 95% CI = 1.89 to 5.74) declined significantly on the seventh day in the KSK group and that of the control group, more pronounced in the study group. None progressed to the symptomatic state. There was no significant difference in the biochemical parameters. We did not observe any changes in the Siddha-based clinical examination and adverse events in both groups. Conclusion: KSK significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load among asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and did not record any adverse effect, indicating the use of KSK in the strategy against COVID-19. Larger, multi-centric trials can strengthen the current findings. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI2020/05/025215 . Registered on 16 May 2020 Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, Kabasura Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 190 million people and caused 408,600 deaths globally as of 20th July 2021 [1]. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include mild illness (upper respiratory tract infections, fever, anorexia, mal- aise, muscle pain, sore throat, dyspnea, nasal congestion, headache), pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute respira- tory failure, sepsis, and septic shock [ 2]. Confirmatory diagnosis of COVID-19 is done through real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) [ 3]. People who are COVID-19-positive but do not exhibit any of the symptoms are termed asymp- tomatic [ 4]. These asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals could contribute to the rapid and extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 [ 5]. The prevalence of asymptomatic indi- viduals among SARS-CoV-2-infected people is about 40-45% [ 6]. Despite intensive ongoing efforts at drug discovery and vaccine development, there are no proven interven- tions, as of May 2020 [ 7]. Due to the novel nature of the viral infection, the trials have explored drugs/formula- tions from both modern and traditional medical systems [8]. In the Indian context, Ayurveda, yoga and naturop- athy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and homoeopathy (collectively called as AYUSH) are traditional medical systems recognized and patronized by the government under the Indian Ministry of AYUSH. Of the AYUSH systems, Ayurveda, yoga, and Siddha systems of medi- cine are indigenous to India. While Ayurveda has a wider presence, the Siddha system of medicine is rooted in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and is prac- ticed in ethnic Tamil populations of the world. The Siddha system of medicine s principles of the human body and also con- ceptualizes unique individual body constitution of everyperson called as Udaliyal [9]. These traditional systems play a vital role in the management of national health care needs [ 10]. They advocate drugs of herbal, mineral, and animal origins for treating various diseases. Almost 360 thousand traditional formulations/practices of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Sowa-Rigpa have been tran- scribed into the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library in India [ 11]. The reported action of herbal drugs depends on the phytochemical components [ 12]. Non-specific targeting antiviral therapeutic methods triggered the ad- vancement in research on plant-based antiviral agents. Herbal antiviral formulations have contributed to man- aging viral infections [ 13]. It was found after the screening of hundreds of Chinese medicinal herbs, extracts from Lycoris radiata ,Artemisia annua ,Pyrrosia lingua had anti-SARS-CoV effect [ 14]. In the context of COVID-19, it is important to revisit the research potential of such antiviral herbal formula- tions. In fact, one such Siddha classical poly-herbal for- mulation Nilavembu kudineer (made as a decoction) documented antiviral action against the dengue virus [15]. Herbal formulations from the Siddha system of medicine have been widely used during the times of outbreaks of dengue in Tamil Nadu, and specifically, Nilvembu kudineer is reported to have contributed to the reduction in severe outcomes due to chikungunya and dengue in Tamil Nadu during 2015 [ 16]. Further, many such formulations from the Siddha system of medicine have immune-stimulating and inflammation- modulating effects [ 17]. Hence, on the basis of such documentation in the past, an Indian advisory by the Ministry of AYUSH incorporated the role of the Siddha system of medicine for COVID-19 [ 18]. On the lines of the national advisory, the state of Tamil Nadu proposed the use of Siddha formulations in the management of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 through a new scheme, called Arokkiam in which Kabasura Kudineer is one such polyherbal Siddha formulation [ 19]. Kudineer (KSK) is use in Aiya suram (fever) and Aiya noigal (respiratory diseases) inNatarajan et Trials (2021) 22:623 Page 2 of 11 9090\u00a9 2021 Journal of Research in Ayurvedic Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow 13 Original Article Access this article online Quick Response Code: Website: https://www.jrasccras.com/ DOI: 10.4103/jras.jras_47_21 Submitted : Bagh, New Delhi, 3Central Council for Research Pallavi Mundada, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Room No. 013, CCRAS Headquarters, 61-65, Institutional Area, Block, Janakpuri 110058, New India.

For reprints contact: reprints@medknow.comA randomized controlled trial to evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of Chyawanprash in healthcare workers during are high-risk individuals in the management of epidemics caused by highly contagious disorders such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Standard of care (SOC) for the prevention of exposure can be greatly supported with SOC measures to improve the immune response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of combining Chyawanprash, an Ayurvedic formulation, with SOC for prevention versus SOC alone among frontline HCWs through assessment of the proportion of COVID-19 cases among the trial participants during the trial period. METHODS: This open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted from June 13, 2020 to September 21, 2020 in an Ayurvedic hospital that was functioning as a COVID-19 care center in New Delhi during the pandemic. HCWs between 25 and 60 years of age working in an environment with the possibility of direct exposure to COVID-19 cases were enrolled and observed for 30 days. The interventions compared were SOC as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles (Group I) and SOC in addition to Chyawanprash 12 g twice a day for 30 days (Group II). RESULTS: Out of the 193 participants who completed the study, no participant in both groups was COVID-19 positive at the end of one month. No adverse drug reaction or any serious adverse event was reported during the study. No clinically significant change in the safety parameters were observed. A statistically significant rise in serum IgG level was seen in Group II, but other inflammatory and immune markers did not show any statistically significant difference. In the post-intervention follow-up, four subjects in Group I and two subjects in Group II reported to have developed COVID-19 disease after 2 months of completion of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Chyawanprash has an immunomodulatory effect in the intervention group, but a longer-term clinical trial with a bigger sample size is needed to confirm its adaptogenic and preventive efficacy as an add-on to standard prophylactic guidelines for prevention of disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Whether Ayurvedic formulations such as Chyawanprash ( Rasayana medicine) when given along with the standard preventive measures can protect the HCWs better than the use of standard of care alone was not known. So this study was conducted to explore the same. The study revealed that Chyawanprash was well tolerated by the participants and the trial group was better protected even after 2 months of the post-intervention period.HeadA=HeadB=HeadA=HeadB/HeadA HeadB=HeadC=HeadB=HeadC/HeadB Text=TextInd=Text=TextInd TextInd=TextInd=TextInd=TextInd 9180 \u00a9 2021 Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - MedknowOriginal Article Access this article online Code: Website: https://www.jrasccras.com/ DOI: 10.4103/jras.jras_15_21 Submitted : : Traditions and Policy, TDU, Bangalore, 7CCRAS, New Delhi, India Address for correspondence: Dr. Harbans Singh, Central Ayurveda Research Srivastava S, Singh H, Muralidharan S, Mohan R, Chaudhary S, Rani P, et al.

For reprints contact: reprints@medknow.comA retrospective analysis of Ayurvedic clinical management is a new contagious pathogen which has made a huge impact on health, economic and societal perspectives of our country. Early detection, rapid isolation, and adoption of effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are key to preventing and controlling COVID-19 infection. Patients are now receiving symptomatic treatment. This retrospective study aims to assess and comprehend the effectiveness of Ayurvedic interventions in the treatment of mild symptomatic COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze the outcome of Ayurvedic interventions in managing mild symptomatic COVID-19-infected cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 patients (diagnosed through RT -PCR test) admitted at Shri Dhanwantry Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Chandigarh were treated with Ayurvedic interventions. The data were collected and have been analyzed retrospectively. Data collected were systematically analyzed and presented using appropriate software (SPSS version 21). RESULTS: The treatment given in this particular study were aimed at dissipating the pathogenesis based on Ayurvedic principles of management. Relief in major clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, and throat pain has been observed in studied cases of COVID-19. The clinical recovery rate observed in this study was 94.3%, which is comparatively high with reference to the current clinical recovery rate, i.e., 69.5% in Chandigarh (India). CONCLUSION: The Anu T aila Nasya, may play a major role in managing mild symptomatic cases of COVID-19.

Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19. Methods Objective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively. Results In control group, 11.7% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100% vs 82.3%) days to stay in hospital ( 6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p< 0.0001) . Conclusion Results of the study suggest that Guduchi Ghan Vati, a common and widely used Ayurveda preparation, could benefit treating asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Larger, randomised controlled Trials are required to confirm the findings. Keywords: Ayurveda, Guduchi Ghan Vati, .

Take part in our Impact Survey (15 minu Guduchi Ghanavati to Improve Immune Status and General Health in the Population at High Risk of COVID-19: Results o An Open-Label Non-Randomized Clinical Trial from India A article is a preprint. It may not have been peer reviewed. Share this article Abstract Background: Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, can oer prophylactic or therapeutic solutions fo COVID-19. Govt of India recommended Guduchi Ghanavati (Ayurveda herbal formulation) as an Immunity enhance and prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to assess the eect of Guduchi Ghanavati as prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2, as immunity enhancer and on Quality of life in adult volunteers who are at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Materials &amp; Methods: Non-randomized, multi-centric, controlled tr was conducted on the population of the community dwelling individuals having good health and were at moderate very high risk of exposure to COVID 19 infection at ve cities in Gujarat, India. Participants of the intervention arm received 'Guduchi with standard preventive guidelines (SPG) for SARS-CoV-2 infection (washing hand frequently, physical distancing, and covering th face). Participants of the control group followed standard preventive guidelines only. The outcome measures were the incidence of COVID-19, changes in Immune Status, WHOQOL-BREF, and preliminary safety. Results: a total of 41 incidences of COVID-19 were reported in GG+SPG group (n=15729 analyzed) whereas 16 incidences in SPG only group (n=4845 analyzed) indicating no signicant association between the incidence of COVID-19 and Add-on GG intervention (OR, 0.79; CI, 0.44- 1.41 and Adjusted OR, 0.67; CI 0.37-1.21). Analyzing the eect on secondary outcomes, a signicant dierence (p&lt;0.001) was reported in the mean score of immune status parameters (Immune score, Immune function, and general health) with the higher score in the GG+SPG group. Mean score changes for all four domains (Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental) of QOL were also statistically signicant ((p&lt;0.001) in GG+SPG group compared to the standalone SPG group with a small eect size No serious adverse event was reported in both groups. Conclusion: Data of the study supported the routine use of Guduchi Ghanavati to improve immune status and general health without any claim on COVID-19 as pre-exposure prophylaxis.

In this dire situation, there is an urgent requirement for the development and immediate disseminat ion of treatment against COVID19. The traditional medicine system of Siddha can be utilized as preventive care to boost the immune system. The vast treasure of knowledge found in Siddha medicine can help in the betterment of humankind. Kabasura Kudineer ( KSK) is from the ancient times present as an immune -boosting agent against several diseases. The present experimental setup to investigate the immunom odulatory and thrombolytic potential of KSK . The da albicans assay and nitro blue tetrazolium have demonstrated that KSK is giving better results compared with the controls (pooled serum, lipopolysaccharide, and streptokinase). The KSK at the concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 g/ml showed % immune -stimulations of 12.40 %, 20.81 %, 33.53 %, 43.20 showed 19.00 %, 25.50 %, 64.00 %, 71.00 % respectively. And similarly, the thrombolytic activity showed 50 and 100 g/ml concentration showed 43.83 %, 71.83 % clot lysis respectively; and the c ontrol value for the streptokinase showed 83.78 %. Hence, it can be confirmed that KSK has immunomodulatory and thrombolytic properties in in vitro models, although the in vivo and the identification of KSK are to be This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Design: Multicentre, parallel efficacy, randomized, controlled, open label, assessor blind, exploratory trial with a convenience sample. Patients followed to complete 12 weeks of study duration. Setting: COVID-19 dedicated non-intensive care wards at 1 government hospital, 1 medical college teaching hospital and 1 medical university teaching hospital Participants: 140 consenting, eligible, hospitalized adult patients suffering from mild and moderate symptomatic COVID-19 and confirmed by a diagnostic (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR assay on nasal and throat swab were randomized to SOC or SOC plus AYUSH 64. To be withdrawn if disease becomes severe. Interventions: Two tablets of AYUSH 64, 500 mg each, twice daily after meals, and continued till study completion. SOC (symptomatic and supportive) as per national guidelines of India for mild and moderate disease. Main outcome measures: Time period to clinical recovery (CR) from randomization baseline and proportion with CR within 28 days time frame; CR defined in the protocol Results: 140 patients randomized (70 in each arm); 138 patients with CR qualified for analysis. Both groups were matched at baseline. The mean time to CR from randomization was significantly superior in AYUSH 64 group (95% CI -3.03 to 0.59 days); a higher proportion (69.7%) in the first week (p=0.046, Chi-square). No significant differences observed for COVID-19 related blood assays (such as D-Dimer). AYUSH 64 arm showed significant (p<0.05) superior persistent improvement in general health, quality of life, fatigue, anxiety, stress, sleep and other psychosocial metrics. 1 patient on SOC required critical care. 48 adverse events (AE) reported in each group. Barring three SAE (in SOC), AE were mild and none were drug related. 22 participants (8 on AYUSH) were withdrawn. No deaths were reported. Conclusions: AYUSH 64 hastened recovery, reduced hospitalization and improved overall health in mild and moderate COVID-19 when co-administered with SOC under medical supervision. It was safe and well tolerated. Further studies are warranted.

Hence it was felt it should be evaluated in COVID 19 which has similar symptom complex. Aim: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of AYUSH 64 as an add -on to standard care in ear ly stage COVID -19 patients. Materials and methods: After obtaining IEC permission, a single centre, randomized, open lab elled, controlled, pilot study was undertaken. Asymptomatic to mild COVID 19 (RT -PCR positive) patients, wh o gave written informed conse nt, were randomly allotted either AYUSH 64 for 14 days as an add -on treatment to standard care or standalone standard care . The outcomes variables were changes in WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement, incidence of development of COVID symptoms, use o f oxygen therapy, use of mechanical ventilator, duration of total symptomatic phase, adverse drug reaction ,death and changes in laboratory values. Results: Among total 115 screened, 80 participants were included, out of which 41 received AYUSH 64 in additi on to standard care and 39 only standard care. The mean final WHO score was comparable for both the Groups, however, mean scores in the interventional Group showed downward trend from 7th day onwards as compared to the control Group. Difference in laboratory 104Page 2 of 20 values and need for oxygen were not statistically significant in both the Groups. No incidence of the requirement of a mechanical ventilator, adverse drug reaction, and death were observed in either of the Groups. Conclusion: The findings of this study show that an integrated approach of AYUSH 64 with standard care did not exert promising difference in core outcomes of COVID -19 when compare to standalone standard care . However, a trend towards lower values was observed in the sympt oms in AYUSH 64 add -on group in comparison to standalone standard care .

INTRODUCTION: The COVlD -19 pandemic has generated a worldwide health crisis posing an unparalleled public health emergency. Though COVID -19 cause s minimal or mild symptoms in most of the cases, significant proportion of individuals require admission to an Intensive Care Unit.[1]As of now, mainly symptomatic supportiv e treatment is being provided to the patients whereas seriously ill individuals are treated with organ support .[2]As, d eveloping a new drug is a complex process that can take 12 -15 years ,[3]repurposing of existing drugs is the fastes t option for Covid -19 treatment .[4]The majority of the drugs used for its treatment worldwide fall primarily under antivir al, antimalarial, anti -inflammatory, monoclonal antibodies categories .[5] As disease specic drugs are not available , drugs are currently use d solely on an empirical basis .[6]These drugs include Ribavirin,Sofosbuvir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Ivermectin, Hydroxy of these drugs are taken as prophylaxis based on merely expert opinion such as HCQ ( Hydroxychloroquine ,)[9,10] Vitamin C, Zinc etc. in conventional medicine. A recent study on AYUSH 64 demonstrated that,of the 30 cases of influenza like illness (ILI) treated with it , 28 recovered without any further need for medication.[11]Even in earlier study, an in tegrative approach involving modern medicine and traditional medicine has reported encouraging outcomes .[12]Hence , it was thought to repurpose AYUSH 64 as add-on to standard care in early stage COVID 19 patients .[13]Therefore , this pilot study was carried out with objectives to evaluate efficacy of AYUSH 64 as add -on to standard care in improving clinical status and to assess its safety in early stage COVID 19 patients . 1051 Efficacy and safety of Guduchighan Vati in asymptomatic and mild to moderate cases of COVID -19: A Ayurveda College & Institute, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India 2 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India. * Corresponding Author: Dr. Amit Kumar Rai Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India 61-65, Institutional Area, Opposite India Email: dr.amitrai1983@gmail.com ABSTRACT: Background: Currently, there is no approved treatment for the management of COVID -19 pandemic. Drug repurposing of existing medications could be a possible way to find out a novel therapeutic entity to combat the COVID -19. Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety profile of an Ayurveda Intervention ( Guduchighan Vati ) in asymptomatic and mild to moderate cases of COVID -19. Methods: This was an open -label randomized controlled pilot study with a sample size of 30 participants (15 in each arm). The participants were asymptomatic or mild to moderate cases of COVID -19. Guduchighan Vati 500 mg twice daily for 10 days was administered in t he intervention group as standalone therapy and Hydroxychloroquine in the control group. 1062 Outcome measures: Time to negative RT -PCR for COVID -19, proportion of participants turned RT-PCR negative for COVID -19 at 5th and 10th day, duration to achieve complet e clinical recovery, improvement in laboratory parameters and incidence of Adverse Drug Reaction/Adverse Event. The data was compared within group using paired sample t -test/ Wilcoxon signed rank test and between group using independent sample t -test/Mann -Whitney test. The results of RT -PCR test was compared between group using chi -square test. Results: 93.3% participants turned RT -PCR negative for COVID -19 in the intervention group, as compared to 66.6% participants in control group till 10th day of the study period. However, the results are statistically insignificant ( p = 0.068 ) which might be attributed to smaller sample size. All the symptomatic patients in the intervention group were clinically recovered at 5th day whereas 14 out of 15 recovered in t he control group. No symptoms were observed at 10th day in both the groups. No adverse drug reaction/serious adverse event were observed during the study period. Conclusion: Guduchighan Vati is a safe and effective treatment for asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID -19 and it lowers the time to RT -PCR negative status without any adverse drug reaction/adverse event.

This study was planned to explore the potential of AYUSH -64 as add -on to conventional care i n improving the clinical recovery and negative RT -PCR conversion in asymptomatic and mild COVID -19 cases . Materials and Methods : An open -label randomized controlled study was conducted at Government Medical College, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India with a sample size of 60 participants . In this study, asymptomatic or mild COVID -19 patients were randomized and allocated into intervention and control gro up in 1:1 ratio . AYUSH -64 two capsules (500 mg each) were administered thrice daily, after food with water for 30 days along with standard care in the intervention group, while the control group received only standard care . The effect 108 of the interventions was assessed in terms of negative RT-PCR for COVID -19, clinical cure rate and inflammatory cytokines . Outcome measures : Primary outcome was the time to attain negative RT-PCR for COVID - 19 and proportion of participants turned RT -PCR negative for COVID -19 at 7th, 15th, 22nd and 30th day respectively in the intervention group compared to the control group . Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants who attained clinical recovery at 7th, 15th, 22nd, and 30thday; improvement in laboratory parameters on the 30th day (as compared to baseline ) and incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions /Adverse Events (ADRs /AEs). The data was compared within group using paired sample t -test/ Wilcoxon signed rank test and between group using independent sample t -test/Mann -Whitney test . Results : Statistically signifi cant difference was not observed in the proportion of participants who turned RT-PCR negative during each of the follow -ups (p=0.134) and both groups demonstrated comparable efficacy . The clinical recovery rate in terms of time taken for complete cure of sympto ms in the symptomatic participants was 60 % and 37 % on day 15 (p=0.098) and 100 % and 85 .2% on day 30 (p=0.112), in the intervention and control group respectively which is numerically a better clinical outcome in the intervention group . The improvement in the inflammatory markers such as IL -6, TNF - and D-dimer was statistically significant in the intervention group (p<0 .05). None of the participants developed any complications nor were any significant ADR /AE observed in both the groups . Conclusion : In patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID -19, AYUSH -64 as add -on to standard conventional care, contributed to improving the duration for attaining complete clinical cure and demonstrated potential in reducing the levels of pro -inflammatory markers in the body.

A cross -sectional analysis of the data generated through this mobile application has been performed and pres ented in this article to examine the acceptability and extent of utilization of AYUSH preventive measures in India. Objectives: The objectives of this cross -sectional analysis was to determine the trends of the utilization of AYUSH measures by the benefici aries as reported by AYUSH practitioners and by the practitioners themselves for the prevention of COVID -19 and to determine the benefit obtained in terms of self -reported parameters of general well being, the overall impact on general health and in preven ting the onset of flu -like symptoms. Methods: A secondary data analysis was undertaken, utilizing the cross -sectional data generated through the AYUSH Sanjivani App from May to July 2020. The responses in terms of demographic profile, utilization pattern, benefits obtained, the interventions used and the data of beneficiaries in terms of geographic location and interventions prescribed were analyzed statistically to assess the trends of the utilization of AYUSH measures for prophylaxis. Results: Data of 74,568 AYUSH physicians and 1,35,21,245 beneficiaries/ health seekers whose data were reported by 3623 AYUSH practitioners were used for analysis. AYUSH advocacies/measures Vati, Chyavanprash, and Arsenicum Album -30 were the most commonly used AYUSH interventions. Improvement in terms of appetite, bowel movements, sleep, mental well being, stamina, change in pre -existing disease , and change in disposition were reported by 42400 (61.3%) physicians. Maximum beneficiaries were from the state of Gujarat followed by Madhya Pradesh. Arsenicum Album -30 was the most commonly prescribed/distributed intervention among the beneficiaries/ health seekers. Conclusion: Maximum physicians have re ported having benefited from the use of AYUSH prophylactic measures for the prevention of COVID -19. Moreover, a good proportion of the Indian population was provided the AYUSH prophylactic measures as recorded in the app. Album -30 1101 An Open label prospective interventional study to assess the prophylactic effect of Guduchi Ghan Vati in COVID -19: A community -based study in a containment zone of Himachal Pradesh , India Full names and institutional affiliations of all the authors: 1.

The World Health Organization documented SARS -CoV -2 as a public health concern in March 2020 .[1] India has the world's fastest growing outbreak of COVID -19 in absolute numbers according to WHO, reporting more than 5\u00b76 million infections as of Sept 22,2020 .[2] The COVID -19 risk is greater in older people and patients having other health problems such as lung diseases, heart diseases, diabetes and cancer.[3] Studies show that 1131| P a g e Efficacy of Pranayama in Preventing COVID-19 in Exposed Healthcare Professionals: A for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, New Delhi 2 Professor & Head of Neurology, Lady Hardinge Medical College,New Delhi 3 Assistant Professor of Biochemistry, Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi 4 Director, Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi Corresponding Author Dr. Ishwar V. Basavaraddi, Director Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India 68, Ashoka g e ABSTRACT Background: The global outbreak of COVID-19 has created a challenging situation, especially among the frontline Health Care Professionals (HCPs), who are routinely exposed and thus at a relatively higher risk of infection. A few studies have shown the practice of Pranayama, a component of Yoga, to be effective in improving immune function and reducing infection. However, no clinical trial on the efficacy of Pranayama in preventing COVID-19 has been conducted. Aim & Objective: This randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of Pranayama in preventing COVID-19 infection in Health Care Professionals (HCPs) routinely exposed to COVID-19 cases. Methodology: The study was conducted at 5 different COVID-19 hospitals in New Delhi, India during September-November, 2020. 280 HCPs assigned duties with COVID-19 patients who were found negative in COVID-19 antibody test in pre-intervention assessment were recruited and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group practiced especially designed Pranayama modules twice a day (morning and evening) for 28 days under the supervision of Yoga instructors through online mode, while those in the control group were advised general fitness practices (like walking, jogging, running). Participants who became symptomatic underwent RTPCR / Point of Care Rapid Antigen test for confirmation of COVID 19 diagnosis. All the patients also underwent antibody testing for COVID-19 on 28th day of the intervention to detect asymptomatic infection. Results: 250 participants, comprising 123 in the intervention group and 127 in the control group, completed the study. The intervention and control groups had comparable demographics and baseline characteristics. Three participants (all controls) developed COVID 19 symptoms during the study. On the completion of the study, only one participant in the Intervention group 1153| P a g e tested positive, while 9 participants in the control group (Including three symptomatic participants) tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. This difference was statistically significant (P-value: 0.01). Conclusion: Practice of our especially designed Pranayama module, every day for 28 days was highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infection in exposed healthcare professionals (HCPs).

Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELD) is most widely used in India. A large number of Indian people have been consuming various traditional medicines in the hope of better protection against COVID-19 infection. Several studies have reported immunological benefits of Ashwagandha and its potential as vaccine adjuvant. We plan to study co-administration of Ashwagandha with COVISHIELD vaccine on safety, immunogenicity and protection. Methods and analysis We designed a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, two arm, exploratory study on healthy volunteers receiving the COVISHIELD TM vaccine. In addition to the two dose schedule of COVISHIELD vaccine as per national guidelines, participants will be administered 8gm Ashwagandha or placebo tablets respectively per day. Primary outcome measure is immunogenicity as measured by SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) and RBD-specific IgG antibody titres. Secondary outcome measures are safety, protective immune response and quality of life measures. Adverse event following immunization will be monitored at each time throughout the study. Participants will be tracked on a daily basis with a user friendly mobile phone application. Following power calculation 600 participants will be recruited per arm to demonstrate superiority by a margin of 7% with 80% power. Study duration is 28 weeks with interim analysis at the end of 12 weeks. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained through the Central and institutional Ethics Committees. Participant recruitment is expected to commence by August 2021. Results will be presented in conferences and published in preprint followed by peer-reviewed medical journals.

Despite the diligent worldwide efforts to contain it, there is an exponential rise in cases. Associated serious morbidity and mortality has continued the efforts towards a clinically proven prophylaxis and therapeutic strategy. In the absence of any effective approved treatment, drug repurposing of available drugs are underway across the globe for treating COVID 19 patients. AYUSH 64 is an antimalarial Ayurveda formulation repurposed in COVID 19 management due to its proven efficacy in malaria and influenza like illness. Trial Design: This was a prospective, open -label, single -arm, pi lot study conducted at Ayurveda and Unani Tibbia College (A&U Tibbia ) and Hospital, Designated COVID - 19 Health Center under Govt. of NCT of Delhi. Objective: The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of AYUSH 64 in the management of asymptomatic, mild to moderate COVID -19 cases .However the secondary objectives were to assess clinical safety and to describe the clinical profile of COVID -19 with special reference to early symptoms, severity of disease, complications, course of disease, diagnostic investigations, biochemical & imaging abnormalities and patterns of clinical recovery. Methods: The study was conducted on 40 patients out of which maximum were asymptomatic and mild COVID -19 cases of either sex aged above 18 years admitted in the hospital with positive naso -pharyngeal swab test for SARS -CoV -2 (RT-PCR ) or Rapid antigen test. Ayush - 64 tablets in the dose of two tablets ( 500 mg ) thrice a day after food with warm water was given to the participants for the period of 7 to 14 days but once the patient got RtPCR negative ,medicine was discontinued. The primary outcome of the 123 study was negative status of SARS -CoV -2 on nasal or throat swab after 07 days or 14 days of intervention in a 2 -day continuous real time RT -PCR test and changes in liver enzymes & renal functions. The secondary outcome of the study included the mean time (days) for clinical recovery as per clinical recovery criteria d efined, number of symptomatic patients showing clinical recovery and improvement in selected laboratory parameters:, differential and total leukocyte counts, acute phase reactants, serum IL -6, Assay (IgE ,IgM and IgG). Resul ts Out of 40 participants who were enrolled in the study, 36 (90%) completed the trial. Out of 36 participants, 69.44% participants after 07 days of AYUSH 64 intervention in the study became RT -PCR negative until 8th day and the rest 30.55 % participants completed the study in 14 days and they turned RT -PCR negative on 15th day. Out of 36 participants, 28 participants were symptomatic . 39.28% participants clinically recovered in 7 days of AYUSH -64 intervention and 53.5% participants clinically recovered i n 14 days. Mean time for clinical recovery was 7.04 days (\u00b1 2.88 days standard deviation). No adverse drug reaction was found in any of the participants. Serious adverse event (SAE) was reported in two participants (5%) just another day after enrolment in the study, which was not related, to the trial drug and the same was informed to the sponsor . Conclusion Among asymptomatic and mild COVID -19 cases , the repurposing of AYUSH 64 was found effecatious and quite safe to alleviate infection with significant clinical improvement within 14 days. Subsequent research on larger scale is warranted for statistically robust evidences in the treatment of COVID -19.

Many clinical studies from the Indian system of Traditional Medicines [Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)] have been carried out to find appropriate solutions. Through a living systematic review and meta-analysis, this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Traditional System of Indian Medicine (AYUSH system) in lowering the incidence, duration, and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We will search the following databases: Pubmed; the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL); the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI); Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA): AYUSH research portal; and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. Clinical improvement, WHO ordinal scale, viral clearance, incidences of COVID-19 infection, and mortality will be considered as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be use of O2 therapy or mechanical ventilator, admission to high dependency unit or emergency unit, duration of hospitalization, the time to symptom resolution, and adverse events. Two authors will independently search the articles, extract the data and disagreements will be resolved by the involvement of a third reviewer. Data will be synthesized, and the risk of bias will be assessed with RevMan 5.4 tool. Certainty of evidence will be assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) tool. The review will be updated bi-monthly with two updates. Conclusion: This living systematic review will be the first to address AYUSH interventions in COVID-19, synthesizing the full spectrum of Indian Traditional System of Medicine against COVID-19.

Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences , New Delhi , India, 110058 Professor FNASc, FAMS National for chemoprophylaxis against COVID -19 in actively engaged high-risk health -care worker s. Design: Randomized, multicentric, open label, active control, two arm parallel efficacy study of 16 weeks. Sample size was based on pre -set 15% non-inferiority margin to HCQ for prophylaxis against COVID with 80% power and alpha < 0.05 . Participants: 400 health -care worker s from three sites who were asymptomatic and tested negative for a quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction test (RT-PCR ) for COVID -19 and SARS -CoV -2 antibodies (IgG) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Participants observed physical protection measures as per the national policy . All incident confirmed COVID -19 were withdrawn. Interventions: Two tablets of 250mg standardized aqueous extract of WS , twice daily after meal or HCQ 800 mg loading followed by 400 mg weekly for 16 weeks as per the national guidelines . Main outcome measures: The primary efficacy measure was \"failure of prophylaxis \" as confirmed by RT-PCR at any time during the study. Both intention -to-treat (ITT) and per - protocol (PP) efficacy analys es were performed. Results: 95 participants in the Ashwagandha (WS) arm and 101 participants in the HCQ arm completed the study. Both groups were well matched at the baseline. 91 participants from the Ashwagandha arm and 84 from the HCQ arm were withdrawn because they received the COVID -19 vaccination . Four participants (2%; 95% CI 2.8 ) in the Ashwagandha and 5 (2.5%; 95% CI 5.4 to 8 %) in the HCQ arm developed confirmed COVID -19. This was within the prefixed non -inferiority margin and the 95% CI of the absolute risk reduction (ARR) was - 2.9 to 3.8% intention to treat (ITT) and -5.9 to 7.5% per protocol (PP). The 95% CI of ARR for the total COVID -19 cases was -2.8 to 11.9% ITT and -5.7 to 20.3% PP. Several health measures , particular ly anxiety and stress , improved significantly in the Ashwagandha arm. Seven o ut of 117 in the Ashwagandha and 59 out of 178 in the HCQ groups were reported to be possibl e drug-related adverse events (AE); there were significantly less -related AE in 1273 the Ashwagandha group . AE were mostly mild and did not cause withdrawal . All incident COVID -19 cases recovered without complications. Conclusions: Ashwagandha was non-inferior to HCQ in the chemo prophylaxis against COVID -19 in high risk health -care workers . It was significantly safer , well tolerated and improved quality of life measures . Ashwagandha as COVID -19 prophylaxis seems appropriate in high -risk population s. Trial registration: The Clinical Trials Registry India Number CTRI/2020/08/027163 dated . What is already known No specific therapies for COVID -19 are available. In addition to vaccines, safer chemoprophylaxis agents are needed. Use of HCQ based on empirical data is controversial. What this study adds Ashwagandha, a known immunomodulator is non -inferior to HCQ . Ashwagandha can be used for effective che moprophyla xis of COVID -19 with safety and health benefits. 1281 EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF AROGYA KASHAYAM- 20 IN COVID-19 CASES - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY Abstract Introduction: The characteristic clinical features of Covid-19 disease range between asymptomatic to mild-moderate symptoms. Studies suggest that a large population (80%) presents its asymptomatic or milder form. Remaining 20 percent, owing to severity of the diseases, need hospital-based care. Many treatment protocols and strategies have been promoted and recommended by authorities including WHO, but nothing has actually been finalized till date. The present study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of an Ayurvedic formulation viz. Arogya Kashayam-20 in the hospitalized cases of Covid-19. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of Arogya Kashayam- 20 in the cases of COVID-19 particularly the negative conversion of RTPCR in 10 days duration. Material and Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at COVID-19 Care Center, Pt. Khushilal Sharma Government Ayurveda College & Institute, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh with a sample size of 112 participants, aged between 16 to 60 years of either sex. Participants were divided in two groups viz. group A and B. Both the groups received Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), vitamin C and Zinc as per the prevailing ICMR guidelines and group 'A' received additionally Arogya Kashayam -20 for 10 days. Outcome measure of the study was to see the negative conversion RT-PCR test after intervention period of 10 days. CTRI Registration: CTRI/2020/06/026221. Results: Among the 60 cases registered in study group (group A), 51 cases (85.00%) were reported with negative RTPCR on 10th day. Out of 52 cases registered in control group (group B); 39 cases (75.00%) were tested negative RTPCR on 10th day. In both the groups all the cases were discharged asymptomatically on 10th day as per the prevailing ICMR guidelines. No ADR/AE observed during the intervention period. Conclusion : The study observes that the add on intervention group has a better outcome in terms of RT-PCR negative reports after 10 days comparing to the control group.

Read Full License 130Page 2/4Abstract Background: Apart from vaccines, signi\u0000cant efforts have been made to develop prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against COVID-19. Lack of standard therapeutic options for the management of COVID-19 contributes to seriousness of this novel disease. The current strategy for exploring therapeutic interventions to manage this pandemic is broadly based on repurposing and repositioning of existing medications and recommending them for symptomatic support. In the early stage of COVID-19, the interventions that limit the progression of the disease and facilitate early recovery may play a signi\u0000cant role. AYUSH 64 is a polyherbal Ayurveda formulation developed by the CCRAS, Ministry of Ayush, Government of India. It has been found effective and safe in various infective febrile conditions like malaria, micro\u0000laremia, chikungunya, and in\u0000uenza 64, was repurposed for the management of asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID-19 based on the experimental and clinical outcomes indicating its potential bene\u0000ts and safety in disease conditions like in\u0000uenza like illness. Government of India recommended the use of AYUSH-64 to manage the asymptomatic and mild COVID- 19 cases on the basis of outcomes of clinical studies on AYUSH-64 in COVID-19 [6,7]. In this context, this systematic review is planned to synthesize evidence related to the safety and e\u0000cacy of AYUSH-64 as standalone or adjunct to standard care in managing asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID-19. Methods: The PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses- Protocol statement) guidelines have been followed for drafting this protocol. All Randomized Controlled trials that assess the e\u0000cacy and safety of AYUSH-64 for the management of COVID-19 as standalone or adjunct to conventional standard care will be considered for this systematic review. Comprehensive search will be done for the published studies as per the pre-designed search strategy in the electronic databases such as AYUSH Research Portal's \"National Repository on AYUSH COVID-19 Clinical and Other R&D Initiatives\", PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, DHARA, IndMED, COVID-19 Evidence Alerts from McMaster PLUSTM, Epistemonikos, TRIP database, Google Scholar, National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools database of COVID-19 studies, Clinical Trial Registry of India and WHO dashboard for clinical trials related to COVID-19 from inception till October 2021. Data selection and extraction for each study will be performed independently by two review authors, with disagreements resolved by discussion with third review author/consensus. Risk of bias assessment will be performed using the revised tool to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB 2). The results will be quantitatively synthesized (meta- analysis) using Review Manager 5.4. If meta-analysis will not be conducive due to substantial heterogeneity, we will summarize and explain the results of the included studies as the systematic qualitative synthesis. Discussion: To date, this will be the \u0000rst systematic review on the Ayurveda intervention, AYUSH-64 that will synthesize the evidence on its e\u0000cacy and safety in the management of COVID-19. The pilot search undertaken before planning this systematic review resulted in 07 clinical studies on AYUSH-64 that evaluate its e\u0000cacy and safety in the management of COVID-19. These search results justify the initiation of this systematic review. This systematic review will help the policy makers for its wider 131Page 3/4implementation in the management of asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID-19. The results of this systematic review will be published in an indexed open-access journal to ensure wider dissemination.
