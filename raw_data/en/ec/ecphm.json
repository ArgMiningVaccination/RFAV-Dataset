Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a general term that engages a group of complex disorders of neurological development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. Causes: Scientists are not certain what the exact cause of autism is, but there is an increasing understanding that both genetics and environment likely play a role. Studies suggest that ASD could result from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how brain cells communicate with each other, possibly due to the influence of environmental factors on gene function, but all studies are preliminary and require further study. Signs and Symptoms: General Symptoms Hyperactivity Impulsivity Short attention span Aggression Causing self injury Temper tantrums Unusual eating and sleeping habits Unusual mood or emotional reactions Lack of fear or more fear than expected Hypersensitivity to sensory input Early Indicators No babbling or pointing by age 1 No single words by 16 months or two-word phrases by age 2 No response to name Loss of language or social skills Poor eye contact Excessive lining up of toys or objects No smiling or social responsiveness. Autism Later indicators Impaired ability to make friends with peers Impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others Absence or impairment of imaginative and social play Stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus Preoccupation with certain objects or subjects Inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals. 3Photo Courtesy of Gigi's Joy blog Statistics Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) now affects 1 in 68 children and 1 in 42 boys Boys are nearly five times more likely than girls to have ASD There is no current medical detection or cure for autism About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the CDC ) Autism services cost U.S. citizens $236-262 billion annually. A majority of costs in the U.S. are in adult services - $175-196 billion, compared to $61-66 billion for children. In 10 years, the annual cost will be $200-400 billion. The U.S. cost of autism over the lifespan is about $2.4 million for a person with an intellectual disability, or $1.4 million for a person without intellectual disability. 35 percent of young adults (ages 19-23) with autism have not had a job or received postgraduate education after leaving high school. It costs more than $8,600 extra per year to educate a student with autism. (The average cost of educating a student is about $12,000) Myths Truths Autism Continued... All individuals with autism have savant abilities Approximately 1 in 10 may exhibit savant skills The diagnosis of autism is relatively new Autism was first diagnosed in 1908 Autism is a mental health disorder Autism is a neurological disorder Autism is caused by vaccines Such evidence has been refuted Autism is caused by poor parenting Both genetics and environment likely play a role Autism is caused solely by environmental factors Both genetics and environment likely play a role Individuals with autism are unable to form meaningful social relationships The diagnosis of autism does not explicitly determine one's level of social ability People with autism are cold and lack empathetic feelings The diagnosis of autism does not explicitly determine one's level of empathy Therapies and programs for individuals with autism work across the board Therapies and programs may work differently per individual People who are not diagnosed with autism will never exhibit characteristics similar to the characteristics of those who have been diagnosed People who are not diagnosed with autism can exhibit characteristics similar to those diagnosed with autism 42015 The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network estimates that 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) every year. 2013 With the release of the fifth edition of the DSM, subtypes of autism spectrum disorder (Asperger's and Rett's) are eliminated. Individuals are now diagnosed as having an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with varying levels of severity. 1994 The fourth edition of the DSM adds several subtypes to the \"autism spectrum,\" including Asperger's (50 years after it is identified), Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). 1993 The \"neurodiversity\" movement is started by Jim Sinclair, an autistic adult, when he gives a speech titled \"Don't Mourn for Us\" at the International Conference on Autism. 1980 In the third edition of the DSM, autism receives a separate diagnostic category for the first time. 1975 The Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (The DD Act), revises the definition of \"developmental disability\" to include autism. 1971 The first major scientific journal dedicated to autism research - The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders - is established. In the same year, Israel Kolvin's research begins to show differences between autism and schizophrenia. 1952 In the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), autistic-like symptoms are classified under childhood schizophrenia.t 1908 Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler first uses the term \"autistic\" to describe a form of schizophrenia that is characterized by withdrawal. History 5Formal Education Settings How Autism Can Affect the Student: Challenges may include... Sustained attention Visually-based reasoning skills Goal-orientation, planning, and self-monitoring (executive dysfunction) Imitation skills that involve sequences of movements and symbolic movements Understanding others' intentions, mental states, speech, perspectives, language and social skills Learning complex fine motor skills Understanding abstract concepts Processing and regulating sensory input Organizing information and routines. Raised levels of anxiety Regulating emotions Preferences may include: Visual directions and instructions (lists, icons) Answering choice-based questions instead of open-ended questions One question at a time that requires a concrete answer Repetition Cues for transitioning from one activity to the next. Prompts for answering questions Incorporating a preferred special interest Structure and sameness How Art Can Impact a Student with Autism: The arts provide independence and collaboration, demonstrate a process of self-expression, imagination and creativity, and create a way to understand difficult abstractions. The impact of visual arts includes: Assisting with the development of cognition Developing meaningful self-expression Increasing imagination and abstract thinking Improving visual-spatial discrepancies Improving fine motor skills Increasing communication and social interaction Improving coping Developing self-management and organizational abilities The impact of performing arts (Dance, Music, Theatre) includes... Developing HOT (higher order thinking) skills like analysis, synthesis, evaluation and problem solving Enhanced ability to focus and interact with others Developing communication skills (expression, auditory awareness, rhythmic speaking) Stimulating the transmission of information in the brain Reorganization of the brain by utilizing both hemispheres. Encouraging collaboration Developing social skills (responding to others, taking turns, sharing ideas) Developing fine motor skills (rhythm, instruments) Photo Courtesy of New Albany K-1 Elementary Photo Courtesy of New Albany K-1 Elementary 6Formal Education Settings Continued... How Autism Can Affect the Educator: Educators should... Use visuals Maintain clear structure in the classroom Capitalize on the student's interests and determine what motivates the student Teach relaxation techniques Provide choices to open-ended questions Apply rules consistently Prepare student for transitions Communicate with team members Explore why a behavior happens and develop a specific strategy Use clear, direct instruction with precise language Provide visual steps and schedules Use imitation (\"I do, you do\") Use visuals and hands-on activities Focus on strategies that enable a student to complete a task independently Look at problems through the eyes of the student Demonstrate and model expected skills Make eye contact Use proximity and verbal reminders Reinforce a non-preferred activity with a preferred activity Consider modifications if needed (number of items to complete, extra time, varying the response mode, location of desk/materials, sensory materials to increase engagement) How Autism Can Affect the Classroom: In the classroom... Carefully consider what materials to use to meet that individual's needs Limit the supplies that are out and available Be aware of noise, especially background noise Use proximity and prepare ahead with a seating chart Post classroom rules Teach in front of a blank background (wall charts and posters can be distracting) Store unnecessary equipment and supplies in cabinets Keep materials for students to access in a labeled, accessible, consistent location Define personal space and leave room between desks and tables Avoid changing the classroom after it is set-up Provide a quiet space free of visual distractions Avoid air fresheners and perfumes Photo Courtesy of New Albany K-1 Elementary Image Aquired From www.dewberry.com 7How Autism Can Affect the Student: Challenges may include... Less structured environment can be overwhelming Issues with the \"classroom\" space Too much space Acoustics/sound With less structure, social impairment may be more pronounced Advantages may include... Less structured environment can give students more freedom Presents alternative social opportunities for communication and expression Informal setting implies voluntary participation, which can lead to intrinsic motivation to participate Less outcomes based, more student centered How Art Can Impact a Student with Autism: Informal and community arts education programs: Provide a medium for expression and communication Facilitate social interactions and acceptance of \"typical\" peers Inspire motivation to learn and to create Help children with Autism to self-soothe Provide hands-on experiences to help children learn through non-traditional experiences Evidence shows that students with autism who participated in a museum education program: Decreased internalizing behaviors Decreased hyperactivity Increased \"acceptable\" socialization behaviors Improved self-esteem How Autism Can Affect the Educator: Effects are similar to formal education, but differences in environment present additional issues: Often teachers have less control of the classroom space, so it is important to find other ways to adapt Often, teachers see smaller groups of students, so can provide more one-on-one attention Encourage students that there are no wrong answers Plan a consistent schedule as much as possible - routine is important Break down activities into smaller steps to prevent overstimulation Gradually introduce new materials or activities Include the family Start small Use tokens or a reward system to encourage participation Preview activities before diving in Be prepared and well-informed about Autism and potential challenges Informal Education Settings (Including museums, community centers, non-profit orgs, etc.) Photo Courtesy of Sutter Park Preschool Photo Courtesy of Sutter Park Preschool 8Resources for Educators Advocacy Groups The Autism Society of Ohio Autism Speaks VSA Ohio Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence (OCALI) Music in Special Education (2010) by Mary S.

Asperger Syndrome: A developmental disorder related to autism and characterized by higher than average intellectual ability coupled with impaired social skills and restrictive, repetitive patterns of interest and activities. Autism : a mental condition, present from early childhood, characterized by difficulty in communicating and forming relationships with other people and in using language and abstract concepts. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Is a general term that engages a group of complex disorders of neurological development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by deficits in social- emotional reciprocity, in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. Differentiated Instruction: Is the way in which a teacher anticipates and responds to a variety of student needs in the classroom. To meet student needs, teachers differentiate by modifying the content (what is being taught), the process (how it is taught) and the product (how students demonstrate their learning). Formal Education: Is classroom-based, provided by trained teachers. Higher Order Thinking (HOT) Skills : A concept of education reform based on learning taxonomies (such as Bloom's Taxonomy). Higher order thinking skills include critical, logical, reflective, metacognitive, and creative thinking. IEP (Individualized Education Plan): Is a plan or program developed to ensure that a child who has a disability identified under the law and is attending an elementary or secondary educational institution receives specialized instruction and related services. Informal Education: Educational experiences that take place outside of the formalized educational system (i. e. community arts organizations, voluntary and amateur arts organizations, museums, etc.) PDD-NOS: PDD-NOS stands for Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. PDD-NOS became the diagnosis applied to children or adults who are on the autism spectrum but do not fully meet the criteria for another ASD Perseveration: Repetitive use of language, such as repeating the same phrase over and over or repeatedly bringing up the same topic Sensory Dysfunction/Sensory Integration: Children with autism experience light, sound, smells and tastes more or less intensely than other people. As a result, they may be very easily overwhelmed by bright lights or loud noises; alternatively, they may crave lots of crashing, jumping and strong tastes. 11References Adamek, M.
