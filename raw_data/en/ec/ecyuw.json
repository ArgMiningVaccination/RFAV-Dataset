TCM relies on unique theories and practices to treat diseases and enhance health. These practices include Chinese herbal medicine and dietetics, acupuncture and moxibustion, and other non-medication therapies such as Chinese bodywork or manual therapy, known as \"Tuina\", and traditional biofeedback exercises, known as \"Qigong\" and \"Taijiquan\". The integration of TCM in Western health systems and research requires a rational communicable theory, scientific proof of efficacy and safety, and quality control measures. Understanding the structural concepts of the TCM language makes possible the parallelism to Western physiology, and the inherent rational use of the reflex therapeutic systems, anti-inflammatory mechanisms and mental training involved, for example, in acupuncture and \"Qigong\". The results of TCM clinical trials and fundamental research on its nature and mechanisms have encouraged the development and application of well-designed research strategies such as double blinding in acupucture to overcome limitations and resistances in integrating these practices into the existing biomedical paradigms of the West. This review aims to overview some TCM theoretical concepts and the evidence-based clinical application of TCM's leading practices to create an easy-to-consult and condensed source of information, available for the healthcare community, facilitating the understanding and communication between conventional health professionals and TCM practitioners and acupuncturists.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-03-01", "cleaned_text": "Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine Therapeutics: An Overview of the Basics and Clinical Applications [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030257](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030257) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-09-00257), [2](#B2-healthcare-09-00257)]. The \"Yijing\" (\"I The Book of Changes) and the \"Huangdi Neijing\" (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine) are the oldest known written sources of information in TCM philosophy and clinical application. The \"Yijing\", dating back 3000 to 5000 years, describes the course of life systematically based on a mathematical model of regulation. It describes its changes and modalities, offering advice on personal emotional lifestyle and guidance [ [3](#B3-healthcare-09-00257), [4](#B4-healthcare-09-00257)], while the \"Huangdi Neijing\" is comparable in importance to the Hippocratic Corpus in Greek medicine [ [5](#B5-healthcare-09-00257)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00257)]. One of the main goals of TCM is to balance the effects of the body's \"qi\", known in the West as the \"Vital Force\", to live in harmony with the surrounding \"qi\". According to ancient Chinese culture, this includes the energies of \"Heaven\", such as the energy of the sun, moon, planets, and constellations, and the energies of \"Earth\", such as the effects of geographical location, the energy of the plants, soil, water, animals, and natural formations [ [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00257)]. TCM aims to treat not only the secondary manifestations (\"biao\"), but also the primary causes (\"ben\") of several chronic and acute conditions; for example, in internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, traumatology, external medicine, dermatology, emergency medicine, and eye, ear, nose and throat treatments. [4](#B4-healthcare-09-00257)] allows for understanding TCM as a logical model of a system's biology with a structural mathematical language. The analogy to the binary system, considering 0 as \"yin\" and 1 as \"yang\", allows for the understanding of monograms, bigrams and trigrams, which are related to the Phases and the circular regulatory processes seen, for example, in rhythmical seasonal changes, daytime processes and human behavior ( [Figure 1](#healthcare-09-00257-f001)a,b) [ [7](#B7-healthcare-09-00257), [8](#B8-healthcare-09-00257)]. These circular processes are expressed as sinusoidal functions, which integrate the concepts of \"yin\", \"yang\", and the Phases as cybernetic elements and vegetative functional tendencies in human physiological regulation. [9](#B9-healthcare-09-00257)]. Within the regulatory (cybernetic) context, \"yin\" and \"yang\" may enclose the meanings shown [Figure 1](#healthcare-09-00257-f001)a, created from the monograms \"yin yang\", represent the Phases. Each one of these bigrams gives rise to two trigrams, representing [9](#B9-healthcare-09-00257)]. [Table 2](#healthcare-09-00257-t002). [11](#B11-healthcare-09-00257)]. [Figure 2](#healthcare-09-00257-f002)a). The Compass Rose dynamics can be represented as a circular function of vegetative regulation, with \"yin\" and \"yang\" components, wherein the abscissa axis essence, also known as \"jing\", is an essential concept related to the process of aging. According to TCM, each person is born with a finite amount of \"jing\" stored in the kidneys and gradually uses it through life. Some authors consider \"kidney deficiency syndrome\" equivalent to aging in Western medicine. Similarly, \"heart qi deficiency\" is associated with cardiac insufficiency [ [15](#B15-healthcare-09-00257)]. [16](#B16-healthcare-09-00257)]. Within the interstitial connective tissue, TCM meridians or conduits and collaterals constitute a network called \"jing luo\". These conduits, believed to serve as channels for the flow of \"qi\" and \"xue\", are connections between acupoints with effects on specific orbs' clinical signs. There are 12 primary meridians, 6 \"yin\" and six \"yang\", classified as the 3 \"yang\" meridians of the hand, the 3 \"yang\" meridians of the foot, 3 \"yin\" meridians of the hand, and 3 \"yin\" meridians of the foot. The \"yin\" meridians pertain to the \"zang\" organs and the \"yang\" meridians to the \"fu\" organs. In this way, \"qi\" and \"xue\" flow through them and reach every part of the body in a cyclical circulation [ [17](#B17-healthcare-09-00257), [18](#B18-healthcare-09-00257)]. 2. Chinese Herbal Medicine and Dietetics [19](#B19-healthcare-09-00257)], Chinese knowledge of botanic medicine dates back to the discovery of \"Ma Huang\" (herba ephedrae), around 3000 BC. This herb was initially used as a stimulant but was also used for respiratory disorders and other diseases. The active ingredient in herba ephedrae is ephedrine, an effective bronchodilator, making [22](#B22-healthcare-09-00257)]. [Figure 2](#healthcare-09-00257-f002)[ [21](#B21-healthcare-09-00257)]. Flavors can be classified according to their \"yin\" or \"yang\" quality, and each one belongs to one of the Five Phases: - Sweet belongs to the Phase Earth (spleen and stomach). It has a warming, strengthening, harmonizing, relaxing, and moistening effect. Sweet has the most potent supplementing effect on the body; - Acrid or pungent belongs to the Phase Metal (lung and large intestine). It moves the \"qi\", invigorates energy circulation, loosens stagnation, disperses, opens pores, frees the surface of exogenous disease factors, and produces perspiration; - Salty belongs to the Phase Water (kidney and bladder). It cools, moistens, produces a downward bearing, softens, and loosens; - Sour belongs to the Phase Wood (liver and gallbladder). It has an astringent effect, and gathers and preserves fluids; - Bitter belongs to the Phase Fire (heart and small intestine). It has a drying, hardening, and downward-bearing effect. [21](#B21-healthcare-09-00257)]. Some of the selected plants used in TCM are shown in [Figure 3](#healthcare-09-00257-f003). Chinese Herbal Medicine Tendencies in Research and Clinical Applications [24](#B24-healthcare-09-00257)]. In 2002, 2007, and 2012, the percentages of American adults who used any CAM approach in the past 12 months were 32.3%, 35.5%, and 33.2%, respectively [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-00257)]. The variability of CAM's prevalence in different countries is significant. In France and Germany, two European countries with a higher prevalence, those values reached 49% and 46%, respectively [ [24](#B24-healthcare-09-00257)], while in Australia it was about 52% [ [26](#B26-healthcare-09-00257)], and in Singapore nearly 76% [ [27](#B27-healthcare-09-00257)]. Although the statistics correspond to different years, the relative global analysis remains accurate, showing a significant variability. [15](#B15-healthcare-09-00257)]. Artemisia annua, also known as sweet wormwood, became popular in the West after Tu Youyou was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against Malaria. Tu Youyou, a pharmacologist trained in TCM, start working in the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Beijing, China) in 1955. In 1969, she started leading a research group focused on searching for antimalarial drugs among traditional Chinese medicines. After reviewing the traditional Chinese medical literature and folk recipes, and interviewing experienced TCM practitioners, a reference to sweet wormwood (\"Qinghao\"), which had been used in China around 400 AD to treat \"intermittent fevers\" (a symptom of malaria), came to her attention. The first clinical trial was carried in October 1972, after multiple extraction studies. The trial was successful, and the team started working in the isolation and purification of what came to be known as artemisinin. Later, the team discovered dihydroartemisinin, a derivate of artemisinin that is ten times more potent clinically, demonstrating a high efficacy, rapid action and low toxicity [ [28](#B28-healthcare-09-00257)]. [29](#B29-healthcare-09-00257)]; likewise, the trend in published articles on TCM in general has also increased [ [30](#B30-healthcare-09-00257)]. Indeed, with a simple analysis of PubMed, the previous observation can be quickly confirmed. Therefore, twenty commonly used Chinese herbs were chosen, and using the PubMed database, their names were searched in the titles of articles in general. [Figure 4](#healthcare-09-00257-f004)shows the retrieved numbers of publications per herb (data accessed on 10 February 2021). [Figure 5](#healthcare-09-00257-f005)shows the total number of publications per year (the histograms) and the cumulative number of publications (the continuous lines) since 1950. [31](#B31-healthcare-09-00257)]. [32](#B32-healthcare-09-00257)]. [33](#B33-healthcare-09-00257), [34](#B34-healthcare-09-00257), [35](#B35-healthcare-09-00257)], three related to hypertension 17 and 39 RCTs) [ [36](#B36-healthcare-09-00257), [37](#B37-healthcare-09-00257), [38](#B38-healthcare-09-00257)], three related to COVID-19 (involving 19, 7 and 18 RCTs) [ [39](#B39-healthcare-09-00257), [40](#B40-healthcare-09-00257), [41](#B41-healthcare-09-00257)], two related to depression (involving 40 and 16 RCTs) [ [42](#B42-healthcare-09-00257), [43](#B43-healthcare-09-00257)], two related to headache (involving 31 and 30 RCTs) [ [44](#B44-healthcare-09-00257), [45](#B45-healthcare-09-00257)], and the others related to allergic rhinitis (involving 17 RCTs) [ [46](#B46-healthcare-09-00257)], spinal cord injury (involving 26 RCTs) [ [47](#B47-healthcare-09-00257)], breast pain (involving 17 RCTs) [ [48](#B48-healthcare-09-00257)], primary Raynaud's phenomenon (involving 8 RCTs) [ [49](#B49-healthcare-09-00257)], insomnia (involving 13 RCTs) [ spasticity (involving 35 RCTs) [ [52](#B52-healthcare-09-00257)], irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (involving 21 RCTs) [ [53](#B53-healthcare-09-00257)], diabetic kidney disease (involving 20 RCTs) [ [54](#B54-healthcare-09-00257)], and Wilson's disease (involving 18 RCTs) [ [55](#B55-healthcare-09-00257)]. All articles reported the beneficial effects of Chinese herbal medicine when used as a primary treatment or adjunct therapy to Western medicine. Nevertheless, almost all meta-analyses reported the low quality of the included RCTs, identifying problems in randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding, dropouts, heterogeneity, and sample size. [42](#B42-healthcare-09-00257)]. In addition, in the study conducted by Shi et al. (2019), despite the clinical heterogeneity, the authors found that when comparing Chinese herbal medicine with a placebo, the overall quality of evidence according to the primary outcome measures was moderate or high, and the overall quality of evidence in Chinese herbal medicine relative to Western medicine was low or moderate. These results support Chinese herbal medicine's efficiency for use on headache patients, at least to a certain extent [ [45](#B45-healthcare-09-00257)]. [56](#B56-healthcare-09-00257)]. Indeed, radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (\"Danshen\") has been used in clinical practice for over 2000 years. This herb enhances blood circulation and clears blood stasis, two crucial qualities in cancer treatment. [57](#B57-healthcare-09-00257)]. Even so, validated standards for this kind of treatment are still lacking, which causes problems as regards oncologists' acceptance [ [58](#B58-healthcare-09-00257)]. [19](#B19-healthcare-09-00257), [20](#B20-healthcare-09-00257)]. and lasers [ [60](#B60-healthcare-09-00257), [62](#B62-healthcare-09-00257), [63](#B63-healthcare-09-00257)] are used to replace handheld needles in certain circumstances [ [64](#B64-healthcare-09-00257)]. [Figure 6](#healthcare-09-00257-f006)). [67](#B67-healthcare-09-00257)]. Although there is still some criticism about the clinical specificity of auricular points/areas representing organs or structures of the body, some researchers have reported scientific evidence of the human body's somatotopic representation on the outer ear. Romoli et al. (2014) have shown that stimulation of the thumb auricular acupoint (TAA) selectively activates the secondary somatosensory area bilaterally, and that stimulation of the brainstem auricular acupoint (BSAA) mostly activates the cortical and limbic regions that are part of the pain matrix. The results of this pilot study show that the specificity of auricular acupoints can be assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and that the brain responses of the two tested acupoints might be linked to their respective therapeutic indications [ [68](#B68-healthcare-09-00257), [69](#B69-healthcare-09-00257)]. [70](#B70-healthcare-09-00257)], stress, anxiety and depression [ [71](#B71-healthcare-09-00257)], as well as in managing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [ [72](#B72-healthcare-09-00257)]. Auriculotherapy has positive effects associated with the conventional treatments of insomnia and chronic and acute pain. Further well-designed studies are required to evaluate this technique's effectiveness in treating other health conditions [ [69](#B69-healthcare-09-00257)]. Main Characteristics [Figure 7](#healthcare-09-00257-f007)) [ [73](#B73-healthcare-09-00257), [74](#B74-healthcare-09-00257), [75](#B75-healthcare-09-00257)]. A higher density of gap junctions has been found at the sites coincident with acupuncture points. These gap junctions are hexagonal protein complexes that form channels between adjacent cells, facilitating intercellular communication and increasing electric conductivity [ [76](#B76-healthcare-09-00257)]. Deep connective tissue structures in locations corresponding to acupoints have been characterized by a higher concentration of Ca, P, K, Fe, Zn, and Mn [ [75](#B75-healthcare-09-00257)]. It is well known that both Ca2+ and K+ are critical signal mediators playing an essential role in physiological activities [ [77](#B77-healthcare-09-00257)]. [78](#B78-healthcare-09-00257), [79](#B79-healthcare-09-00257), [80](#B80-healthcare-09-00257), [81](#B81-healthcare-09-00257), [82](#B82-healthcare-09-00257)]. It is also claimed that the conductivity between two points along the same meridian (or conduit) is greater than that between points not sharing this relationship, leading to the commonly held opinion that acupuncture structures are special conduits for electric signals [ [80](#B80-healthcare-09-00257)]. These findings have led to the theory that the meridians reflect the pathways of least electric resistance throughout the body. Structurally, these may represent fascial cleavage planes, where extracellular ionic fluids can spread electric potentials over great distances without overcoming cellular membranes' resistances [ [83](#B83-healthcare-09-00257)]. It is even conceivable that these low-resistance extracellular fluid pathways might have branches connecting them to the internal organs, thus providing some concrete, albeit hypothetical, basis for the traditional organ-meridian associations [ [64](#B64-healthcare-09-00257)]. These low-resistance fluid channels, where chemical and physical transports occur, are known as low hydraulic resistance channels [ [84](#B84-healthcare-09-00257)]. The conduit network has also been related to the controversial existence of a primo vascular system known as Bonghan corpuscles and ducts. These thread-like vessels are thought to be similar to blood and lymph capillaries, but are distinct in structure, and some are located inside blood and lymph vessels. Thus, tendinomuscular structures, primo-vessels (Bonghan ducts), and regions of increased temperature and low skin resistance have been suggested as features of the meridian network, or used as identification methods [ [73](#B73-healthcare-09-00257)]. [85](#B85-healthcare-09-00257)]. Some studies suggest a relationship between the anatomical direction of collagen fibers along the conduits and acupoints, and these structures' functions [ [75](#B75-healthcare-09-00257), [86](#B86-healthcare-09-00257)]. Collagen is the main structural protein in the connective tissue, forming a fibrillary matrix containing an interspersed and ordered network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that supports protons' rapid conduction, thus acting as a semiconductor [ [74](#B74-healthcare-09-00257)]. 3.1.2. Physiological Effects and Mechanisms of Acupuncture According to Western Medicine [19](#B19-healthcare-09-00257)]. [Figure WHO published in 2002 a detailed review and analysis of randomized controlled trials formally published throughout 1998 (and early 1999) in which acupuncture was proven to be an effective treatment [ [113](#B113-healthcare-09-00257)]. In 2017, an extensive revision focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses (the highest form of evidence available) of acupuncture was authored by John McDonald and Stephen Janz. These authors used \"The Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs 2010 Alternative Therapies Review\" and the \"United States Department of Veterans Affairs Acupuncture Evidence Map 2014\" as a starting point. They updated them in a single document known as \"The Acupuncture Evidence Project: A Comparative Literature Review\", reviewing the effectiveness of acupuncture for 122 treatments over 14 clinical areas. The authors found evidence for acupuncture's effectiveness in 117 conditions, with more robust evidence for some conditions than others. Stronger evidence of the positive effects of acupuncture was found for migraine prophylaxis, headache, chronic low back pain, allergic rhinitis, knee osteoarthritis, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain [ [114](#B114-healthcare-09-00257)]. [96](#B96-healthcare-09-00257)]. [115](#B115-healthcare-09-00257), [116](#B116-healthcare-09-00257)], on the other hand, some authors point to little or no effect compared to controls [ [117](#B117-healthcare-09-00257), [118](#B118-healthcare-09-00257)]. More studies are needed to clarify the ambiguities. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be an excellent strategy to assess nerves' measurable changes after acupuncture. As shown by Chan et al. (2018), while evaluating the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on the electrophysiological properties of the ulnar nerve, the stimulation of HT4 increased the electrical sensitivity and decreased the stimulus intensity to achieve the maximum amplitude, and avoided a significant increase in latency and decrease in reaction velocity in two consecutive electrical stimulations [ [119](#B119-healthcare-09-00257)]. Using the same assessment strategy on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in type 2 diabetes patients, Meyer et al. (2020) found that classical needle acupuncture had significant effects on DPN, and that improvements in NCS values presumably indicate structural neuroregeneration following al. (2002) performed a large, methodologically rigorous double-blinded trial to assess two questions: Can acupuncture contribute as an adjunctive therapy to the conservative management of LBP? Is real acupuncture superior to sham acupuncture? These authors found a pain reduction of 50% or more at three months after treatment. The rates of achievement of the primary outcome, by group, based on intention-to-treat analysis, were as follows: real acupuncture 76.6%, sham acupuncture 29.3%, and conservative orthopedic therapy 13.9% [ [93](#B93-healthcare-09-00257)]. [93](#B93-healthcare-09-00257)]. In 2010, the same authors conducted a randomized pragmatic, controlled, patient-blinded, multi-center trial to study the effects of acupuncture on chronic shoulder pain. They found significant results for verum over sham and verum over conventional orthopedic treatment (p < 0.01). Moreover, the descriptive statistics showed a more significant improvement of shoulder mobility (abduction and arm-above-head test) for the verum group versus the control group immediately after treatment and after three months, indicating that Chinese acupuncture is an effective alternative to conventional orthopedic treatment [ [94](#B94-healthcare-09-00257)]. These results agree with other studies regarding frozen shoulder [ [125](#B125-healthcare-09-00257)]. [20](#B20-healthcare-09-00257)]. In this field, acupuncture has shown beneficial results as the primary therapy for reducing the severity of depression [ [101](#B101-healthcare-09-00257), [102](#B102-healthcare-09-00257), [103](#B103-healthcare-09-00257), [126](#B126-healthcare-09-00257), [127](#B127-healthcare-09-00257)]. Chan et al. (2015) concluded that combined acupuncture and antidepressant treatment is more effective than antidepressants alone in the first six weeks of treatment. Acupuncture can be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated therapy in the early onset of depression, and may reduce antidepressants' side effects [ [100](#B100-healthcare-09-00257)]. [87](#B87-healthcare-09-00257), [128](#B128-healthcare-09-00257), [129](#B129-healthcare-09-00257), [130](#B130-healthcare-09-00257)]. Often, these conditions induce nausea and vomiting. The stimulation of the acupoints PC6 and ST36 to reduce nausea and vomiting is well documented, and has strong efficacy evidence [ [131](#B131-healthcare-09-00257), [132](#B132-healthcare-09-00257)]. The proposed action mechanisms stand on the neural response at the insula, hypothalamus and cerebellum responsible for the autonomic regulation of vestibular function, and on the somato-parasympathetic reflex, with improves gastric emptying through increased vagal activity [ [133](#B133-healthcare-09-00257)]. 3.2. Moxibustion [59](#B59-healthcare-09-00257)]. Artemisia tinder has come to be known in the West as moxa, a Japanese derivation word (\"mogusa\", herb for burning). The classical method of performing moxibustion is to make the tinder into a cone and apply it to the skin at points identical to those used for acupuncture. It could be used as a counter-irritant by blistering and scaring the skin, or as a milder form of heat treatment by applying it to the skin with a layer of vegetable material or salt interposed between the skin and the cone. Another method is to combine moxibustion with acupuncture by placing a piece of moxa on top of a needle inserted into the body and igniting it. Thus, the moxa's heat is conducted down the needle to the surrounding tissues [ [138](#B138-healthcare-09-00257)]. [139](#B139-healthcare-09-00257), [140](#B140-healthcare-09-00257)]. The warm temperature of moxibustion induces antipyretic and thermolytic effects by stimulating polymodal receptors in the skin at zones corresponding to acupoints. Vasoconstriction in the treated point and vasodilatation around it are often experienced with increased peripheral blood flow and microvascular permeability. In addition, heat shock proteins naturally synthesized in cells in response to hyperthermia might be induced in local tissues due to the increased temperature. Nonthermal effects are associated with the visible light and infrared radiation emitted by burning moxa and absorbed by the connective tissue, blood and lymphatic vessels, and nerves, which might induce some active substances such as cytochrome c oxidase and intracellular water, two photoacceptor molecules or chromophores. Changes in the water dynamics in membranes, mitochondria and/or cells could modulate signaling pathways, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP (adenosine triphosphate), Ca2+, NO, and inositol phosphates group, with effects on stress signaling, metabolic processes, cytoskeleton organization, cell proliferation/differentiation, and homeostasis [ [141](#B141-healthcare-09-00257)]. The photoelectric effect and photochemical process generate energy that might help adjust the body's immune and neurological functions. [135](#B135-healthcare-09-00257)]. Although these compounds' toxicity represents a concern, moxibustion has been considered minimally toxic, safe and effective, with few adverse events [ [142](#B142-healthcare-09-00257)]. Research has shown that no harmful effects of moxa smoke have been noticed on the heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) of treated persons. Indeed, Cui et al. (2013) reported decreased HR and increased HRV during 25 min moxa smoke exposure, suggesting that moxa smoke has a regulating effect on the autonomic nervous system, and its inhalation has short-term stress-alleviating effects [ [143](#B143-healthcare-09-00257)]. [142](#B142-healthcare-09-00257)]. [144](#B144-healthcare-09-00257)]. Research shows that patients treated with moxibustion experience significantly improved pain, stiffness, and physical function compared with sham-moxibustion [ [145](#B145-healthcare-09-00257)]. Although the majority of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials point to absences in the research and request further well-designed, large-scale RCTs, the overall outcome points to positive effects in managing the symptoms of post-stroke urinary incontinence [ [146](#B146-healthcare-09-00257)] and constipation [ [147](#B147-healthcare-09-00257)], use as an adjuvant therapy for chronic kidney disease [ [148](#B148-healthcare-09-00257)], and in treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy [ [149](#B149-healthcare-09-00257)]. Limited or low evidence of positive effects was found in chronic low back pain, [ [150](#B150-healthcare-09-00257)] and in treating lumbar disc herniation [ [151](#B151-healthcare-09-00257)]. 3.3. Cupping [152](#B152-healthcare-09-00257), [153](#B153-healthcare-09-00257)]. However, it has also been reported as a successful intervention in both usual and emergency treatments, such as herpes zoster, acute asthma episodes, angina pectoris and abdominal pain induced by poisoning [ [154](#B154-healthcare-09-00257), [155](#B155-healthcare-09-00257), [156](#B156-healthcare-09-00257)]. Cupping is used to move stagnant blood out of deep bruises by bloodletting, and reduce swelling and pain in sprains. Cupping can be done by heating the air within the cupping glass and then putting the cupping glass on the skin. Cooling the air by clapping the cup over the affected area exerts mild suction. The pull exerted pushes the flesh into the cup, mobilizing body fluids into the area [ [64](#B64-healthcare-09-00257)]. Simple cupping of a point is believed to suck off \"humor\", removing excess fluid from the point. Often, this \"humor\" comes with \"ventus\" as \"humor venti\". Thus, cupping is also used to treat \"ventus\" [ [12](#B12-healthcare-09-00257)]. Cupping can also be performed over the needle to enhance acupuncture effects. From a Western perspective, the cupping action mechanisms are still unclear. The sub-atmospheric pressure inside the cup seems to change the skin's biomechanical properties, increasing peripheral blood circulation and pain threshold, improving local anaerobic metabolism, reducing inflammation, and modulating the cellular immune system [ [157](#B157-healthcare-09-00257)]. The comfort and relaxation sensation on a systemic level often reported after cupping might be related to the resulting increase in endogenous opioid production in the brain leading, to improved pain control [ [158](#B158-healthcare-09-00257)]. 4. Chinese Manual Therapy (\"Tuina\") [64](#B64-healthcare-09-00257)]. This art was developed, improved and spread over time by the Chinese laborer people in their continuous fight against diseases. Many aspects of \"Tuina\" have come from the martial arts lineage. Here, the bodywork was used to heal traumatic injury and correct structural misalignments, and keep the martial artist fit and healthy [ [159](#B159-healthcare-09-00257)]. \"Tuina\" can affect the five sense organs' health and help a person feel more vivid via hetero or auto treatments, wherein specific self-massage applications play an essential role [ [64](#B64-healthcare-09-00257)]. [160](#B160-healthcare-09-00257)]. A practitioner may also know and incorporate Chinese herbs, plasters, bone setting, and \"qi\" projection. Originally, \"Tuina\" was developed to treat traumatic injury and for use in pediatric care, whereas \"Anmo\" was directed toward the treatment of internal diseases [ [64](#B64-healthcare-09-00257)]. A distinct aspect of \"Tuina\" is the extensive training of the hands necessary for clinical practice. The practitioner's hands are trained to accomplish focused and forceful movements, applied to several body areas. Techniques such as pushing, rolling, kneading, rubbing, and grasping are practiced until they become second nature ( [Figure 9](#healthcare-09-00257-f009)). Students practice on a small bag full of rice until their hands develop the necessary strength and dexterity. \"Tuina\" is often applied to limited body areas, and the techniques can be quite forceful and intense [ [160](#B160-healthcare-09-00257)]. - In the activation phase, the meridian is stimulated to remove the build-up more easily; - In the intervention phase, the removal of the build-up is performed by specific diagnosis-related techniques; - In the harmonization phase, the intervention's strong effect is normalized with the surrounding tissue's physiological proportions, and is therefore \"harmonized\". [161](#B161-healthcare-09-00257)]. [162](#B162-healthcare-09-00257), [163](#B163-healthcare-09-00257)]. Because these techniques can affect the functioning of the body's internal organs, they are appropriate for internal medicine, gynecology and trauma, and for patients with conditions that may not be thought of as susceptible to treatment through manipulation. The previous may include asthma, dysmenorrhea, chronic gastritis, hypertension, failure to thrive in preterm infants, major depressive disorder, substance abuse and dependence, pain syndromes, and immune and autoimmune conditions [ [164](#B164-healthcare-09-00257), [165](#B165-healthcare-09-00257), [166](#B166-healthcare-09-00257), [167](#B167-healthcare-09-00257), [168](#B168-healthcare-09-00257), [169](#B169-healthcare-09-00257)]. [160](#B160-healthcare-09-00257)]. In this field, Wang et al. (2012) conducted a study to evaluate the impact of \"Tuina\" in treating pediatric muscular torticollis [ [170](#B170-healthcare-09-00257)]. Of the 38 treated cases, the authors reported 34 cases as full recovery, 3 cases as remarkable effectiveness, 1 case as effective and 0 cases as ineffective. With a 100% total effective rate, they concluded that the combined method for treating muscular torticollis regulated tendons, thus relieving blood stasis, and it also improved muscular spasms, dispersed mass, and enhanced and restored neck function [ [170](#B170-healthcare-09-00257)]. \"Tuina\" combined with medicinal decoctions has shown positive therapeutic efficacy in treating pediatric allergic rhinitis [ [167](#B167-healthcare-09-00257)]. As a standalone technique, \"Tuina\" seems to reduce diarrhea frequency in children aged 0-6 years, compared with sham [ [171](#B171-healthcare-09-00257)]. 5. \"Qigong\" [172](#B172-healthcare-09-00257)], and \"gong\", which means the development of capacity. Therefore, \"Qigong\" is a practice that allows the development of the capacity to collect, circulate and apply vital energy. - To eliminate internal pathogenic factors (excessive accumulation of emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, worry) as well as external pathogenic factors (cold or \"algor\", heat or \"calor\", dampness); - To harmonize the \"qi\" flow, promoting orthopaty (self-healing power) and avoiding inauspicious depletion (lack of activity) and repletion (excess of activity); - To regulate and balance the patient's \"yin yang\" functional status, so as to restore harmony. \"Qigong\" and This \"wei qi\" field is believed to include three external layers of subtle energy (physical, emotional and spiritual), each one connected to one of the three \"dantians\" and surrounding the physical body. [174](#B174-healthcare-09-00257), [175](#B175-healthcare-09-00257), [176](#B176-healthcare-09-00257), [177](#B177-healthcare-09-00257), [178](#B178-healthcare-09-00257)]. Both external and internal pathogenic agents affect the \"wei qi\" field's structural formation. Internal factors include repressed emotions such as anger and pain from emotional traumas. Strong non-processed emotions block the regular circulation of \"qi\", creating stagnation in the body. The external factors include chronic and severe environmental agents, such as coldness, humidity, dampness, heat and wind. Physical traumas also affect the \"wei qi\" field by creating fragilities in the external energetic matrix. These fragilities create vulnerabilities, making it easier for disease-causing pathogens to [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00257)]. 5.2. \"Qigong\" as Traditional Biofeedback Therapy [179](#B179-healthcare-09-00257), [180](#B180-healthcare-09-00257)], thereby improving and strengthening the overall state of vegetative regulation (homeostasis) [ [181](#B181-healthcare-09-00257), [182](#B182-healthcare-09-00257), [183](#B183-healthcare-09-00257), [184](#B184-healthcare-09-00257), ( [Figure 10](#healthcare-09-00257-f010)) that use knowledge of the body's internal and external energy fields to purge, invigorate, and balance these energies. Medical \"Qigong\" therapy offers patients a safe and effective way to rid themselves of pathogenic agents, such as painful emotions that otherwise can cause mental and physical illness. As mentioned above, this therapy combines breathing techniques with movement, creative visualization, spiritual intent to improve health, personal power, and control [ [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00257)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00257)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00257), [173](#B173-healthcare-09-00257)]. 5.3. Physiological Effects and Mechanisms of \"Qigong\" Practice [186](#B186-healthcare-09-00257)]. It has been shown that \"Qigong\" and \"Taijiquan\" training may reduce emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and even improves anxiety, and reinforce attention and effectiveness in high school students shown that these skills are stable after weeks of training, allowing young musicians to play the flute in auditions, with warm fingers and reduced anxiety-induced elevation of heart rate, even without a momentary prior application of the learned \"Qigong\" exercises. It seems that positive vegetative changes in the behavioral pattern appear to be naturally available on-demand in critical stressful situations as a part of the child's reactive behavioral repertoire [ [187](#B187-healthcare-09-00257)]. [Figure 11](#healthcare-09-00257-f011)). This technique has been reported while studying \"Qigong\"-related effects [ [195](#B195-healthcare-09-00257), [196](#B196-healthcare-09-00257)]. [194](#B194-healthcare-09-00257)]. These data may also help demystify Chinese medicine, while thermography allows for visualizing the microcirculation effects on the hand's temperature during \"Qigong\" practice. TCM holds that the \"mind\" guides the \"qi\", which therefore guides the \"xue\" (\"blood\"). The Heidelberg model of TCM sees strong analogies between the effects of \"xue\", as described by the classical scriptures, and the clinical effects of microcirculation in Western medicine. Therefore, \"qi\", translated by this model as a vegetative functional capacity, guides and steers microcirculation. In other words, this old phrase from classical scriptures can be demystified accordingly: \"the mind\" (imagination and awareness) can guide and therefore activate vegetative capacities, which in return lead to changes in the microcirculation [ [187](#B187-healthcare-09-00257)]. [67](#B67-healthcare-09-00257)]. [184](#B184-healthcare-09-00257)]. Furthermore, in the field of psycho-emotional imbalances, Griffith et al. (2008) found a significant reduction in stress while studying the efficiency of a \"Qigong\" training program on hospital staff's stress management [ [190](#B190-healthcare-09-00257)]. Saganha et al. (2012) obtained similar positive results after a three-week \"Qigong\" training program for physiotherapists suffering from burnout. In the previous study, the program's efficacy was accessed by the Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) questionnaire, and the results show that the program was able to decrease the mean values of emotional exhaustion and lower the mean values of the subject confirm these results [ [206](#B206-healthcare-09-00257), [207](#B207-healthcare-09-00257)]. Controlled studies developed by Lan et al. (2004) to access the cardioventilatory behavior of elderly \"Qigong\" and \"Taijiquan\" practitioners showed an improvement in aerobic capacity [ [185](#B185-healthcare-09-00257)]. \"Qigong\" also seems to benefit the overall quality of life of older adults with chronic diseases A second crucial factor is the further development of experimental approaches in TCM research, such as the double-blinding of acupuncture trials [ [120](#B120-healthcare-09-00257), [134](#B134-healthcare-09-00257), [135](#B135-healthcare-09-00257), [136](#B136-healthcare-09-00257), [137](#B137-healthcare-09-00257)] and the development of a placebo for \"Qigong\" research [ [212](#B212-healthcare-09-00257)].
