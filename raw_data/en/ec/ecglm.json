Developments in the treatment of diabetes, leukaemia and heart surgerytransplants, amongst others, have beenmade possible through the use of animals inscientific research. The majority of the scientific community consider that the benefitsthat have been provided by the use of animalsin research justify this use. The public alsoincreasingly accepts the use of animals inresearch, with a recent poll finding that 90% of the public accepted the need for the use of animals, providing that certainresearch conditions were met, which are: there is no unnecessary suffering; theresearch is for serious medical or life-saving purposes; and there is no reliable andinformative alternative to their use (MORI 2002). It is important to recognisethat although a significant proportion ofwork using animals is basic research whosebenefits to health are not immediately evident, this work is highly valuable as it provides the groundwork for future medicaladvances. The appropriate moral stance forall use of animals in research is to minimiseanimal suffering and maximise the benefitsto medicine and health, agriculture and fundamental understanding. Animal research only takes place after careful evaluation and within a framework of robustcontrols. UK legislation requires thatresearchers refine their procedures to keep suffering to the minimum, ensure the numberof animals is reduced to the minimumrequired for meaningful results, and seek toreplace the use of animals with non-animal alternatives where appropriate. However, theuse of non-animal alternatives may not beappropriate for some types of research, andthese experiments may be permitted providedthey are designed to keep pain and sufferingto a minimum. The majority of researchusing animals (84%) involves the use ofrodents as experimental subjects, with the use of non-human primates for research purposes, which are subject to particularlyrigorous control due to the special protectiongranted to them under the 1986 Act,accounting for less than one percent of totalanimal experiments. Basic research and drugdevelopment accounted for 82% of all procedures, with safety testing accountingfor the remaining 18% (Home Office 2003a). Opponents of the use of animals in research frequently use the availability of alternative,nonanimal, research methods as evidencethat research using animals is unnecessary. It is true that non-animal methods, such astissue culture, computer modelling, researchusing human test subjects and populationstudies, are frequently used and have utilityfor scientific and medical research. Howeverthese methods are generally used in additionto animal studies, and do not replace them.All the research techniques using animalsdescribed in this guide have very high value and utility for scientific and medicalunderstanding and it is rarely possible toreplace them with a non-animal alternative. This is because a research study oftenrequires more than knowing how individual molecules, cells or tissues behave. Instead,scientific research, and medical research inparticular, often depends on understandingnot only the processes of the living body buthow they interact. It is unethical and illegal The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 1Preparation of this guide This guide has been endorsed by the Council of the Royal Society. It has been prepared by members of the Royal Society Animals in Research Committee. The members of the Committee were: Sir Patrick Bateson FRS (Chair) Biological Secretary and Vice-President, Royal Society Professor Peter Biggs CBE FRS Visiting Professor of Veterinary Microbiology at the Royal Veterinary College, University of London Professor Alan Cuthbert FRS Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge Professor Innes Cuthill School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol Dr Michael Festing Ex-MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Lancaster Professor E Barry Keverne FRS Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge Dr Sheila King Professor Clive Page Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Biomedical Sciences Professor Ole Petersen FRS MRC Secretory Control Research Group, University of Liverpool Professor Nancy Rothwell School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester Dr Matthew Rushworth Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford Dr Vince Walsh Royal Society Research Fellow, Institute of CognitiveNeuroscience & Department of Psychology, University College London SecretariatOlivia Roberts Science Advice Section, Royal Society Throughout this Guide, the word 'animals' is used to indicate non-human animal research subjects.This distinction is required as the valuable research carried out using non-human animal studiesfrequently provides the groundwork to advances in scientific and medical understanding, withpotential benefit for human and animal health. This can then be further refined through theuse of human subjects in research studies. Such studies are conducted and regulated entirelyseparately to research projects using non-human animals, and are not addressed in this report. ivIFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research2Examples of medical advances dependent on the use of animals in research The understanding of the human body has come from more than 200 years of researchon the function of normal cells, tissues andorgans, and on disease processes. Much ofthis understanding has been facilitated byresearch that was performed on animals. This fundamental knowledge underpins theteaching of medicine and veterinary medicineand has been instrumental in the developmentof medical advances for both people and animals. It is no exaggeration to say thatalmost every form of conventional medicaltreatment, such as drugs, vaccines, radiationor surgery, rests in part on the study of animals(US Department of Health and HumanServices 1994). However, this fundamentallink is frequently not appreciated and the following examples illustrate some of theimportant medical advances that have resulteddirectly from animal experiments. 2.1 The use of animals as models Model species are used to test possibilitiesthat would be difficult or impossible to testusing the target species. In general, onespecies may be used as a model for anotherwhen, despite other differences betweenthem, the two species strongly resembleeach other in particular ways. Molecularmechanisms and those involved in cell differentiation and propagation are frequentlyidentical across a wide range of species.Therefore, for some of the most fundamentalprinciples of biology, using animals as modelscan provide valuable insight into human cellprocesses. Animal models also enable amuch greater control of experimental conditions than could reasonably be achievedin humans. Human patients can be highlyheterogenous in disease symptoms and their behavioural variability, such as differences in patients' compliance with instructions, is farmore significant in human trials. In certainuses of animals as models, such as mouse'knock-out' models, in which individualgenes are switched off to study the effect,researchers can even control the genetic make-up of the experimental subjects toensure homogeneity. Opponents to the use of animals in research claim that using animals as models for humansis invalidated by the differ ences between humans and animals. Evidence presented to support this argument includes the case ofthe unpredicted limb defects that occurred inthe children of women who took the drugThalidomide during pregnancy. It is true thatthe damaging effects of Thalidomide ondeveloping embryos were not predicted inthe initial animal experiments but this isbecause the effects of Thalidomide duringpregnancy were not looked for. Had theresearchers at the time attempted to anticipate these effects, then research conducted usingpregnant animal research subjects wouldhave been able to detect these effects, asseen in later studies conducted after theeffects of Thalidomide in humans were discovered and the drug was withdrawn(Hendrickx et al 1966). It is important to emphasise that animals are normally highly accurate models for humans,and in this instance it was experimentaldesign that failed to look for the teratogeniceffects, not that the experiments failed todetect the effects. The similarity betweensome animals and humans is best The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 3to expose human patients to new medicineswithout being confident that they are likelyto benefit and not be seriously harmed, sothe only alternative is to use the most suitableanimal to study a particular disease or biological function. Additionally, in drugdevelopment, animal tests are used to establish both the benefits and the potentialtoxicity of substances and ensure that humanvolunteer studies are carried out with a fullscientific understanding of the substanceinvolved, to maximise the benefits and avoidpossible serious side effects. Further discussionof these issues of the refinement, reduction and the replacement of animals in scientificresearch can be found in Chapter 5. Within this guide, the following issues are considered: examples of medical advancesthat have been achieved through the use of animals; the theoretical framework behindthe use of animals; the legislation that regulates the use of animals; and discussionof philosophies that underpin the debateabout the use of animals in research. The guide is not intended to be a manual ofhow to conduct research. Nor is it a substitutefor good advice on experimental design, statistical analysis or any of the other aspectsof conducting a successful research project.The Royal Society takes an active role in policydiscussions about the use of animals inresearch with numerous bodies, including government departments, funding agencies,charities and discussion meetings (RoyalSociety 2001 & 2002). The Society believes inthe importance of evidence-based discussionand debate, with a view to refining andstrengthening best practice in the use of animals in research. We hope that this document will be of particular use to thosescientists in the early stages of their researchcareers using animals, and are entering thedebate surrounding the use of animals inresearch for the first time. 2IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research4IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 52.2 Case studies Following are three case studies that provide examples of medical advances that have beendeveloped through the use of animals in research. Case study 1: Polio vaccineAn example of the use of animals as models of human cell processes is the developmentof polio vaccine. Polio is an infectious disease that can strike at any age but mainly affectschildren under three years old, and is prevalent in developing countries. The polio virusenters through the mouth and once it enters the blood stream can invade the centralnervous system, destroying nerve cells in the limbs, trunk and the brainstem, resulting inparalysis and sometimes death. Soon after the introduction of effective vaccines in the late1950s and early 1960s, polio was brought under control, and practically eliminated as apublic health problem in industrialized countries. Research into polio vaccine requires theuse of living nerve tissue to ensure that the virus used for vaccine production causes theparalysis typical of polio, and no human or tissue culture alternative is available.Additionally the polio vaccine uses a live attenuated virus, which is notorious for sometimesreverting to virulence, so animals are still the only practical way of predicting the potential virulence of each batch of polio vaccine. As a result of this potential risk to humans, eachbatch of vaccine is tested in animals. This previously involved an intra-cerebral injection ofthe vaccine into monkeys, which is highly predictive of virulence.More recently mice have been genetically engineered to have the receptors for the virus,providing animal models of the disease. Despite the many differences between mice andhumans, the use of genetically modified (GM) mice to establish the virulence of the vaccine provides an accurate model of humans in this respect. This is a good illustration of how mice, and in particular GM mice, can be used as models for human pathogens.Besides being genetically similar to humans, mice are small and inexpensive to maintain.Their short life span and rapid reproductive rate make it possible to study disease processesin many individuals, thus gaining a greater understanding of the progression of the diseasewithin a short space of time.demonstrated by the fact that many drugscan be used to treat both human and animalpatients, such as antibiotics and tranquillisers. The last two decades have witnessed a revolution in biology with the sequencing of the human, mouse and fly genomes. A wealth of information has been producedabout the role of genes and gene products in some diseases, as well as providing insighton why some people respond to some medicines better than others. The knowledge now available from thesequencing of the human, mouse and flygenomes has enabled genetic modificationof animals to produce highly specific modelsof diseases, helping to identify disease pathways and aid the development of newtherapies (Royal Society 2001). An exampleof the use of this technique is detailed incase study 6, and a discussion of the ethicalissues that may arise from the use of this technology can be found in Box 1 inChapter 4.6IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 73From Discovery to Drug 3.1 Lessons from the past Researchers are frequently faced with questions about the use of animals in research.Medical researchers in particular face thechallenge of allegations that the use of animalsfor scientific research is not necessary andthat it is possible to develop new drugs inthe test-tube or even by computer. As mentioned in the introduction to thisguide, the use of non-animal alternatives canhelp to enhance the research using animalsbut is a poor substitute for the high levels ofcomplexity provided by use of whole animals.The following case study provides an exampleof the essential role of animal research in thedevelopment of a new class of drugs. Case study 3: Gastric acid secretion and histamine bindingMost people will have used an antihistamine drug at sometime in their lives, either totreat an attack of hay fever, an allergic rash or similar. Antihistamines work by antagonisingthe effects of histamine, the substance produced in response to the presence of an allergen,by competing with histamine for binding to its receptor, H 1. However, antihistamines do not counteract all the actions of histamine, the most notable of which is gastric acidsecretion. Excessive gastric acid secretion can lead to gastric and duodenal ulceration anduntil the early 1970s the most effective treatment for this ulceration was partial gastrectomy,which is a very invasive treatment. Consequently an alternative was required and workundertaken in the mid 1960s using animals helped to develop an alternative treatment inthe form of a drug therapy. It was necessary to use animals as the research requiredobservation and analysis of living, working organs, and was thus only observable in wholeanimals, as the use of human subjects is prohibited for these types of invasive study.The reason why conventional antihistamines failed to block the gastric acid secretion wasthat histamine has more than one type of receptor and can produce a number of differenttypes of effect. Antihistamines are therefore unable to bind to all these different receptortypes and block the receptor responsible for gastric acid secretion. This concept of multiplereceptors for a single chemical was already known when Black started his work and his research involved four bioassay systems: guinea-pig ileum muscle, guinea-pig atria, rat uterus and perfused stomach of anaesthetised rats. All of these test systems showed aphysiological response to histamine, but the responses of the last three failed to be inhibitedby conventional antihistamines. Black's work consolidated earlier research by undertakinga long chemical exploration of molecules related to histamine using the four bioassay systems. The first breakthrough was the finding that 4-methylhistamine was almost inactiveon the ileal bioassay, but effective on the other three, thus identifying a selective agonistfor the receptors mediating gastric acid secretion. Further information about the discoveryof selective H 2- and selective H2-antagonists can be found in James Black's Nobel Prize Lecture (Black 1988). An additional bonus in this story was that cimetidine, the first clinicallyused H 2antagonist, also antagonised the effects of gastrin on gastric acid secretion, thus enhancing the understanding of the physiology of gastric acid secretion. In conclusion,understanding the role of gastrin and histamine in gastric acid secretion and the developmentof therapies would probably not have been readily solved without the use of animals.Case study 2: Kidney dialysis and kidney transplantsOf the 5000 people who develop kidney failure every year in the UK, one in three woulddie without a kidney transplant or regular dialysis on a kidney machine. Dialysis and transplant techniques were developed through the use of animals such as rabbits anddogs as the use of humans was not permitted for such invasive techniques. These animalsprovide excellent experimental models due to their close physiological similarity to thehuman respiratory and cardiovascular systems. For example, kidney dialysis machines,which remove toxic waste products from the blood, were developed directly through workon rabbits and dogs. The drug heparin, which is added to the blood to prevent clotting asit passes through a kidney dialysis machine, was discovered by research using dogs and isstill prepared from animal sources. Techniques for kidney and other organ transplants were developed using dogs and pigs in the 1950s. Although the surgical technique soon became routine, transplanted organs,such as kidneys, hearts and livers, were frequently rejected by the recipients' immune systems. Through research in rabbits and dogs, immunosuppressive drugs, which are now used post-surgery for all organ transplants, were developed to prevent rejection. In the late 1970s, animal tests for the drug cyclosporin, a fungal extract purified for possible use as an anti-fungal agent, showed that it was even more valuable as a potentimmunosuppressant. Subsequent tests in humans found that cyclosporin helps to prolongthe survival of transplanted kidneys, and cyclosporin is now widely used to stop tissuerejection in organ transplants. However, a narrow margin of dosage exists between the prevention of rejection and theover-suppression of the immune system and consequently a raised risk of infection.Research on transplants in dogs showed that combining cyclosporin with steroids producesa three-fold increase in survival time, and this combined treatment is widely used today.Each year about 2000 patients in the UK receive a life-saving kidney transplant, and manyothers would benefit from additional donors. With the cost in the first year of treatmentbeing about half that of dialysis, both economic and patient quality of life benefits thathave been achieved from research in animals are considerable.The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 9 8IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in researchCase study 4: Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where future therapies are being developedthrough the use of genomics. Much research is focused on correcting the genetic deficiencies that lead to the disease either by gene therapy, which would turn the faultyprotein into a functional protein, or by finding alternate pathways to bypass the need forthe cystic codes for a large protein, CFTR protein, that functions as an epithelial chloridechannel and has a regulatory influence on many other cellular proteins. Without a functionalform of this protein a person suffers from a lethal genetic disease, cystic fibrosis. In otherconditions, such as the secretory diarrhoeas associated with cholera, CFTR is a key playerin the devastating loss of bodily fluid. The need to discover high affinity ligands that interactwith both CFTR protein and some of the common faulty forms of this protein is key to thedevelopment of cystic fibrosis therapies. A recent search for CFTR ligands was carried outusing cells in culture expressing CFTR protein and a halide indicator, as normal CFTR functionsas a chloride channel. In a recent search for agents that activated or inhibited the channel,CFTR protein was expressed in cultured cells that also contained a reporter molecule thataltered its fluorescence when either chloride (or other halide) entered or left the cells(Tonghui et al 2002). By screening 50,000 diverse compounds, six compounds were discovered that blocked the activity of CFTR protein and further chemical modification ledto several channel blockers with sub-micromolar activity (Tonghui et al 2002). Having identified these six lead compounds using non-animal methods, further research was thencarried out by testing in mice to establish the most active compound. What this exampleshows is the multiple methodologies involved in testing a potential therapy, and that theuse of animals remains a key stage. The search for CFTR activators continues, which mayprove useful for future therapies for cystic fibrosis, and further investigations will undoubtedlyrequire the use of transgenic animals bearing common mutations of the CFTR gene.3.2 Drugs for the futureA great number of diseases remain for whichdrug therapies are far from optimal or even nonexistent. Many drug targets are proteinsand the completion of the human genomeproject, the blueprint for around 30 000human genes and 250 000 proteins, hasenabled the genes encoding for these proteins to become known and providespotential for a greater understanding of disease at the molecular level than at anyother point in history. Techniques such asgenomics and proteomics can help provide a wealth of information about these proteinssuch as their functional role, and can helprefine experimental procedures, but they cannot sub stitute for the complexity provided by whole subject studies for increasingunderstanding and developing treatmentsof disease. The long and complex route fromdiscovery to drug will inevitably require theuse of animals at some stage of the scientificinvestigation and it is important to realise thelimitations of non-animal techniques. Many challenges to the healthcare systems of both developed and developing countriesexist that would benefit from the use of animals in research. One example of potentialfuture therapies is discussed in case study 6.Other examples include: \u00b7Drug-resistant infections, which are a majorproblem in both developed and developingcountries, frequently involve examination ofdisease progression and research could benefit from the use of animal models suchas genetically modified mice.\u00b7Mental illnesses, especially depression,schizophrenia and anxiety, which require a holistic approach, involving molecular, cellular and whole animal studies. \u00b7Better treatments for diseases of bone,joints and the immune system, all of whichinvolve complex interactions throughoutthe body. \u00b7Treatment of diseases of genetic origin, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy,which could utilise genetically modified animals to mimic human patients. \u00b7Blindness and deafness, which involveanalysis of these functions in living research subjects. \u00b7HIV infection and AIDS, with animal modelsof the disease required to develop and testpossible vaccines or antiviral agents beforetrials can be safely conducted in humans. \u00b7Senile dementia and other complications ofold age, where the cause and progressionof these conditions is poorly understood atpresent, and require detailed examinationof the brain and nervous system in animalmodels.The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 114Ethical approaches to the use of animals All those involved in the debate about the use of animals in research lay claim to one orother moral principle. In human and veterinarymedicine, causing pain or suffering in apatient is considered unethical unless it is forthe direct benefit of that patient. Those whofavour work on animals may do so to alleviatethe suffering of humans or other animals.Scientists in favour of this principle use their research to understand fundamentalaspects of biology that in turn facilitate thedevelopment of therapeutic measures forboth animals and humans. Those whooppose the use of animals in research mayobject to the means by which scientistsattempt to achieve their goals. One view is that each animal has the right to life and humans should not take such a rightaway from it. It is not entirely clear whetherthe proponents of such a view would grantrights to every organism that showed signsof reacting to maltreatment. Nevertheless,they would argue that rights to good treatment, once granted, must be respected.Others would argue that while grantingrights to animals is inappropriate becausehuman rights are firmly embedded in a socialcontext, humans have responsibilities for animals in their care and should ensure thattheir welfare is good. Both the rights and theresponsibilities arguments are sometimes taken as absolutes, over-riding all othermoral claims. However, this could also be thecase for the moral argument for supportinganimal experiments because of their potentialmedical benefit. The alternative to suchabsolutism is to respect the range of viewsby attempting to both minimise the sufferinginflicted on animals used in research whilemaximising the scientific and medical gain,which is consistent with the Royal Society'sposition on this issue. Indeed, this is the position enshrined in UK law governing theuse of animals in research (see Appendix 1).Balancing between these positions requiredby law is not an exact process since theassessment of scientific and medical benefitand that of animal suffering are both difficult to quantify and are not expressed in the same terms. The assessments areincommensurate and, therefore, referring tothe judgement as cost-benefit analysis is misleading. So the degree of suffering mightbe expressed as low, medium or high andthe likely scientific and medical benefit might be similarly classified. Research thatinvolves low suffering to the animals andwas likely to be highly beneficial would generally be regarded as acceptable.Research that involves medium suffering but only a medium chance of generating abeneficial outcome would probably bedeemed unacceptable - but clearly thisjudgement will depend on a consensus viewderived from a judgement by those bodiesresponsible for granting approval to research projects. A discussion of considerationsinvolved in assessing costs and benefits isprovided by the report of the AnimalProcedures Committee (Home Office 2003a). Criticism of the use of animals in research sometimes arises when there appears to beno immediate tangible health benefit of theresearch. An inability to quantify the benefits of a research project can be seen to implythat it is frivolous or wasteful and thereforeunethical. This is an invalid assumption, however, as research studies that do nothave direct benefit to humans or other 10 IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in researchanimals can instead provide a vital contributionto fundamental scientific understanding thatmay provide benefit in the future. Individualexperiments are similar to the individualbricks in a building, with knowledge beingbuilt up over a long period of time and with the benefits perhaps only being realisedwhen the building or the research is completed. On the other hand, the benefitsof applied research may be easier to quantify.For example, in drug development, manythousands of compounds may need to betested in order to develop a new drug. Thismeans that in some cases the research maynot be successful, and may seem futile,whereas in fact such work is essential inrefining knowledge. It is therefore important when considering the ethical justification ofthe use of animals in research to realise thatthe development of a successful drug such asinsulin or the antibiotics may result in savingmany millions of human and animal lives. Current UK law encapsulates the middle ground thinking. Animal research is allowed,but only by qualified people with the appropriate licences issued by the HomeOffice, and under tightly controlled conditions.This is discussed in more detail in the nextsection, and more details on current UK legislation are given in Appendix 2. Projectsare independently assessed for scientificvalidity and subjected to ethical review. Asfar as possible the potential benefits arejudged in relation to likely pain and suffering.Animals must be maintained in good environmental conditions and protected fromdisease. In the UK, Home Office inspectorscan visit premises at any time, without priornotice. The law protects all vertebrates, butthe use of more complex animals and especially primates is even more strictly controlled. The use of animals is not permittedwhere a replacement alternative is available.Where no replacement alternative is available,then experimental protocols should berefined in such a way as to reduce any pain or suffering to a minimum, using for example,analgesics and humane end-points. Finallythe number of animals used should bereduced to the minimum consistent with achieving the scientific objectives of thestudy. Further discussion of the reduction ofthe use of animals in research is provided inChapter 5.2.5 Refinement, reduction and replacement in animal research The guiding principles of animal welfare are the so-called 'three Rs', refinement, reductionand replacement, first clearly defined in1959. The Royal Society strongly endorsesthe principle of the 'three Rs', which areenshrined in UK legislation for the use of animals in research. This means that everyeffort must be made: \u00b7to refine the procedures so that the degree of suffering is kept to a minimum. \u00b7to reduce the number of animals used in research to the minimum required for meaningful results. \u00b7to replace the use of live animals by non-animal alternatives. Current UK legislation requires all researcherswho propose to undertake laboratory orfieldwork involving animals to give full consideration to the three Rs and to seek independent advice and approval from alocal ethics committee. The approvals processfor personal and project licences emphasisesthat researchers should seek, where possible,to avoid the use of animals and mustadvance sound and detailed scientific arguments for their use, explaining why no realistic alternative exists. Scientists mustalso address what is the acceptable trade off between the welfare benefits of the three Rs approach and the costs of not obtaining a more definite result through using intactanimals. The principle of the three Rs is not to remove the use of animals in research, but instead toprovide a mechanism to ensure the best possible use of animals in research. Usinganimals in scientific research provides abedrock for increasing understanding, and is consistent with the three Rs as developingour knowledge helps to enhance existingtechniques using animals, as well as generating knowledge that underpinsresearch studies using humans. The principles of these three Rs are genericand the examples in this section have beenchosen because the logic transfers to manyexperimental situations. Organisations, suchas the Research Councils, provide detailedguidance on these issues and in addition toadvice, they may issue calls for proposalsaimed at developing procedural improvementsthat will lead to a reduction, refinement orreplacement of the use of animals. 5.1 RefinementThe House of Lords Animals in ScientificProcedures Committee defined refinementas 'reducing to a minimum the incidence orseverity of suffering experienced by thoseanimals which have to be used' (House ofLords 2002). Refinement of experimentalmethods, for instance through adequate post-operative care, good housing, andimproved anaesthesia and analgesia, is coveredby the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures)Act and has been standard practice in biomedical research for many years.Refinement of surgical procedures is frequently by technical advances but also by experimenters asking themselves some generic questions that can be asked prior to undertaking any invasive procedures: can I minimise the area of tissue at risk ofdamage or infection? Can any aspect of thesurgical process and subsequent recovery bemade less troubling to the animal? 12 IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 13Box 1: Ethical issues surrounding the use of genetically modified animalsThe potential benefits of using genetically modified animals for research are great, andthere is a strong scientific case for using such animals in order to understand human andanimal disease (Royal Society 2001). An example of this work is provided in case study 5. However, the use of genetically modified animals in scientific research may raise additionalethical issues, such as concerns about possible additional welfare costs that may arisefrom the use of this technology, and ethical questions about using animals in this way. A largely hypothetical concern with respect to genetic modification is that introducing agene into an organism from a very different type of organism may lead to unforeseeninteractions in development, leading to the emergence of animals that have serious welfare problems (Royal Society 2001). However the targeted genetic modificationapproach used to create genetically modified animals for research purposes is likely to bemore predictable than other methods of inducing genomic changes, such as radiationexposure or chemical mutagens. Intensive behavioural studies have been conducted onGM animals to monitor any adverse welfare implications and these have found very littledifference between animals that have been genetically modified and those that have not(Hughes 1996). Moreover, we should also bear in mind that animal breeders have beenselecting for genetically determined traits for many centuries, such as the range of dogbreeds, which are widely accepted but raise similar ethical and welfare issues to geneticallymodified animals. Consequently, investigating methods of assessing welfare and ensuring that any geneticallymodified trait is consistent with good welfare applies equally to animals bred by the conventional technique of selection and genetic modification does not raise major newissues in the area of legislation and welfare.14 IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 155.2 Reduction A requirement of the Animals (ScientificProcedures) Act 1986 is that the smallestnumber of animals should be used, consistentwith achieving the objectives of the experiment. The number needed will dependon the variability of the animals, the minimumsize of any statistically significant differencebetween treatment groups and the chancesof obtaining misleadingly negative conclusions.Using animals of similar age, weight, geneticcomposition and so forth can reduce variabilityof the animals. Best use of the animals canbe obtained by appropriate experimentaldesign and by correct statistical analysis ofthe data. Failure to use good design willresult in more animals being used than is necessary. Poor statistical analysis will resultin unnecessary waste because the conclusionsare unreliable or the data are not used asproductively as might otherwise have beenthe case. This means that researchers mustbe properly trained in statistics and shouldreceive advice from a statistician, who is experienced in dealing with those who workwith animals. Sound experimental design andforethought about statistical analysis are thefirst steps to reducing the number of animalsused in any procedure. Achieving a reductionin the number of animals used is more difficult, however, when a small number ofexperimental subjects would have been usedanyway, for example in research using non-human primates. The reduction process,like refinement, is led by generic questions: How can more data per a nimal be obtained? Can the experiment be repeated with thesame research subjects experiencing a varietyof experimental variables? Case study 6: Reduction The introduction of new techniques can help reduce the numbers of animals used. Inexperiments to investigate brain function, for example, a region of brain tissue may bepermanently removed by surgical lesion in an attempt to understand its function. It maybe possible, however, to use reversible chemical lesions, or temporarily interfere with brainfunction through cooling by injecting chilled saline into the study area (Lomber 1999) todecrease the numbers of animals used. Brain images of animals also provide informationabout the area under study, and may help to reduce the need for more invasive investigativemethods. It may also be possible to use advanced surgical techniques that obviate theneed to kill the animal, as seen in the use of partial lesions, pioneered by scientists in theUSA, to produce visual deficits in only one quadrant of the visual field. They were thusable to use the animals as their own controls by testing their perceptual functions in boththe lesioned and non-lesioned part of the visual field representation. These experimentswere also able to maximise comparability with human data by training the animals in testsidentical to those used with human subjects. Thus the amount, quality and comparabilitywith human data were all enhanced at the same time as the total number of animals usedwas reduced.Will further interventions be necessary or can I plan to avoid further procedures?(Wolfensohn & Lloyd 1994) Case study 5: Refinement A common question directed to researchers using animals is how can one be sure that thespecies being used is appropriate to the study of human health or illness. Selecting theappropriate model is an important step scientifically of course, but also in terms of animalwelfare. The more one can predict the course of the disease induced in the animal, thebetter one can anticipate the animal's behaviours and needs such as changes in housing,diet or diurnal routine. Use of a certain species for research purposes is dependent on theprocess or disease under study. If one compares the genomes of the mouse and humans,one finds that there is a mouse homologue for 99% of human genes, and of the genesimplicated in human disease processes, 90% are present in the mouse. As a consequenceof this degree of similarity, major advances have been made recently by the developmentof transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease (Nicholson et al 2000;Ahmad-Annuar et al 2003). The identification of mutations in the SOD1 gene as thecause of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a lethal neurodegenerative disease, hasopened new possibilities. Mice with mutations in the SOD1 gene develop severe motorneuron degeneration similar to that seen in humans and targeting specific mutations inSOD1 has given researchers the ability to study specific symptoms such as limb weakness,axonal swelling and the timing of onset of symptoms. Genetic manipulation of the mouseis constantly being refined and a future possibility is to be able to switch genes on or offat different stages of the animal's life - a critical step in the study of late onset neurodegenerative diseases. As a result of the experimental refinements made possible bywhat is know as the 'genotype driven approach', gene therapies for ALS and other motorneuron degeneration diseases (all of which are incurable) have begun to be developed.16 IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in research The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 175.4 Summary The principles behind these examples of the three Rs can be extended or modified toother types of animal research. Reductionwould seem to be the factor on which most progress can be made by changes inexperimental design and procedures.Refinement is an ongoing process dependenton new techniques and improvements inhusbandry. Researchers routinely implementrefinement and reduction in their daily routines - it is both good science and cost effective to improve experimental design and increase statistical power. The third R,replacement, is more difficult to achieve because of the unique insights provided byuse of whole animals and because sometechniques cannot of course be used withhuman subjects. Notwithstanding the difficulties, every effort to pursue the threeRs should be made.Case study 7: Replacement The lesion method, studying the effects on behaviour of compromising or removing tissue, is a widely used experimental system in behavioural sciences. One can, however,temporarily interfere with brain functions by applying brief magnetic pulses to transientlyinterfere with normal function. This method therefore replaces the need for permanent,surgical interference of brain function in some experiments. In practice, this technique,called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS, has now been used to study the timingof information transfer between human cortical areas, changes in brain function due to learning and a wide range of perceptual, movement and language functions (see Walsh & Pascual-Leone 2003). This ability to use human subjects in lesion experimentsnow obviates the need for some lesion experiments in non-human primates. This is limited,however, to cases where the brain region of interest is accessible to surface stimulation.Many areas of interest lie too deep to be penetrated by the magnetic fields, in which casesurgical lesions in animals are still necessary. A question about TMS is how one knows theright area has been stimulated with the same degree of certainty as total removal of abrain region by surgery. However, high levels of accuracy of the TMS technique can beestablished by co-registration of the magnetic stimulation site with a human subject's individual MRI scan. TMS also has very high temporal resolution and cortical functions canbe disrupted within time windows as small as 5 milliseconds, thus allowing a temporaldimension to lesion analysis that is difficult to achieve in monkeys with other methods. Genetically modified animals may also offernew opportunities for refinement and reduction. A question often asked of animal research is how one knows whether the species being used is relevant. GM animals provide a means of ensuring that the characteristics of the system under investigation are as closely matched as possibleto the human system that is the target of the research. The research and potential medical benefits of GM animals are already beingpursued in research on heart disease, cancerand muscular dystrophy. From a refinementpoint of view, having available the mostappropriate animal model increases thepower of an experiment and also allows themost sensitive techniques and measures tobe used. These experimental refinements canprovide answers to the three questions posedabove: the best choice of animal, which mayor may not be GM, is a first step to minimisingunwanted aspects of experimental procedures.A discussion of the ethical questions thatmay arise from the use of this technologyhas been provided in Box 1 in Chapter 4.5.3 Replacement The use of whole animals is a key element ofmuch scientific and medical r esearch as it enables normal physiological pr ocesses to be studied within the environment of the livingbody, and helps identify interactions thatinfluence disease processes. When a specificmechanism can be identified, the use of cellcultures may be possible. Similarly, molecularsensors may be used to test the biologicalactivity of particular substances. Whenenough is known about a complex systemfound in intact animals, computer simulationscould prove helpful in exploring the dynamicsof that system; in effect, experiments can beconducted on the computer model.However, such studies generally suggest andrequire further work on whole animals and do not completely replace experiments onanimals. Alternatives to whole animals areclearly versatile, but are as yet incapable ofcapturing the complexity of the living mammalian body. Research that would betypically carried out on animals has beenconducted on humans (Langley et al 2000),but when the outcome is unknown, as isusually the case in research, or the techniquesare invasive, the ethical justification for suchwork is highly questionable - even when thehuman subjects are volunteers. The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 196Conclusion Modern biology, and many of its contributions to the well-being of society, is heavilydependent on the use of animals in scientificresearch. This guide has addressed a number of key issues associated with the use of animals in research. A number of examples of medical advances have been discussed, which provide robustand relevant evidence of the benefits tohuman and animal health derived from theuse of animals in research. The unique roleplayed by animals in sci entific resear ch as models of humans demonstrates the essential role of animals in future scientific r esearch. In the discussion of the process from discoveryto drug, it was established that althoughalternatives to animal research do have utilityin some areas of research, a great deal hasbeen achieved through the past use of animals in r esearch. This point was then reiterated in the discussion of the three Rs, which demonstrated that although everyeffort must be made to use the minimumnumber of animals and ensure that theapproach to the research problem is appropriate, the use of animals in researchcan never be fully replaced by alternatives.The resource also addressed the philosophicaland ethical arguments that are used byopponents to the use of animals in research.A description of the current UK legislationfollows in the appendix and provides a guideto the rigorous controls that are in place toensure the valid use of animals in research. Along with the great majority of the scientific community, the Royal Society considers thatthe benefits of using animals in scientificresearch justifies their use for research purposes. At the same time, the Society alsorecognises that special ethical considerations are involved and that animal research mustbe undertaken only with the greatest care. The Royal Society has produced a statement outlining its position on the use of animals inresearch (Royal Society 2002), which can be found in the appendix of this resource.

There is also additional UK legislation which is covered bythe Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986,which is discussed in more detail below. A.1 The Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 In the UK, all scientific work with animals must be licensed under the Animal (ScientificProcedures) Act 1986, which is administeredby the Home Office. The Animal ProceduresCommittee (APC) is an independent body setup under the Animals (Scientific Procedures)Act 1986 to advise the Home Secretary onmatters concerned with the 1986 Act. TheAct regulates all scientific procedures thatmay cause pain, suffering, distress or lastingharm to 'protected animals', which aredefined in the Act as all living vertebrate animals, except man, as well as one invertebrate species, the common octopus,Octopi vulgaris, from the stage of its development when it becomes capable ofindependent feeding. The definition alsoincludes animals in various stages of development, foetal, larval and embryonic,once the developmental stages of half thegestation or incubation period for the specieshas elapsed (for mammals, birds or reptiles)or when it becomes capable of independent feeding (fish, amphibia and the commonoctopus) (Home Office 1986). Regulated procedures can only be authorisedand performed if there are no scientificallysuitable alternatives that replace animal use,reduce the number of animals needed or refine the procedures used to cause less suffering. In addition, the likely benefits (to humans, other animals or the environment) must be weighed against the likely welfarecosts to the animals involved. Overall, theAct safeguards laboratory animal welfarewhile allowing important medical research to continue, and is widely regarded as thestrictest legislation on the use of animals inresearch in the world. The Act has a three level licensing system: \u00b7Those carrying out procedures must holdpersonal licences, to ensure that they arequalified and suitable; \u00b7The research must be part of an approvedprogramme of work directed by a personwho has been granted a project licence; \u00b7Work must also normally take place at a designated user establishment that has acertificate to carry out such procedures.However, in specific circumstances (such a field trials), work can be carried out elsewhere with the Home Secretary'sauthority. Certain types of animal must alsobe obtained from designated breeding orsupplying establishments. The Act applies throughout the UnitedKingdom and the Home Office has anInspectorate consisting of 30 professionalmedically or veterinary trained staff whoexamine and advise on all applications forlicenses. The Inspectorate also assessesestablishments and work already licensedunder the Act. On average they inspect eachresearch establishment eleven times a year.

Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, January 2003, 238-51.\u00b7Applicants for personal licences must have completed an accredited training programmethat establishes an understanding of legislation, treatment of animals, animalhusbandry, and surgical procedures. \u00b7New licence holders must be supervised bya personal licence holder who has held thelicence for at least one year. This supervision will be lifted once the licencee is considered to have a sufficient level of competence. \u00b7A licence will normally be granted for anindefinite period but will be subject toreview at periods not exceeding five years. Licences for undergraduate students aresubject to annual review. For further information see www.homeoffice.gov.uk/animalsinsp/licensing/forms/personal_lic_notes.doc ii) Project licences Project licences are granted to an individualon the basis that: \u00b7The potential results are important enoughto justify the use of animals (the cost benefit analysis). \u00b7The research cannot be done using non-animal methods. \u00b7The minimum number of animals will be used. \u00b7Dogs, cats or primates are only used whenother species are not suitable. \u00b7Any discomfort or suffering is kept to aminimum by appropriate use of anaestheticsor painkillers.\u00b7The researchers and technicians conductingthe procedures have the necessary training, skills and experience. \u00b7The justification for the choice of model,together with the choice of species and theconsideration of possible use of alternativesis satisfactory. \u00b7The research is done with a knowledge of other work in the field, to preventunnecessary duplication of research. \u00b7Project licences are issued for a maximumof five years. As the programme of workevolves, project licences should be amendedas required so as to maintain an accuraterecord of the work in progress. \u00b7Research premises have the necessary facilities to look after the animals properly(as detailed in the Home Office Code ofPractice). The project licence must also undergo thelocal Ethical Review Process at the relevantdesignated establishment(s) prior to submittingthe application to the Home Office for formal assessment. A.5 Local Ethical Review Process A new level of regulation came into effect inApril 1999 with the introduction of the localEthical Review Process (ERP). This made theUK unique by having parallel systems ofscrutiny at both national and local levels. It is a Home Office requirement that all establishments appr oved under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 should havean ERP satisfactorily installed. The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 25In addition, at each establishment, a Named Veterinary Surgeon must be on call at all times. All registered premises must also havea Named Animal Care and Welfare Officer(NACWO) with the specific responsibility forthe welfare of the animals. Further information is available at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/animalsinsp/reference/legislation/index.htm. A.2 The Animals Procedures Committee The Animals Procedures Committee (APC)provides independent advice about animalresearch legislation for the Home Office, and its members come from a wide variety ofbackgrounds. The Committee considers boththe legitimate requirements of science andindustry, and the protection of animalsagainst avoidable suffering and unnecessaryuse, when approving licensing applications.The APC may be asked to comment on anapplication for a licence when there is doubtabout licensing a particular piece of work. There must be a minimum of 12 members (excluding the Chairman), one of whommust be a lawyer and at least two thirdsmust be medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons or have qualifications or experiencein a biological subject. At least half of themembers must not have held a licence tocarry out procedures on animals within thelast six years and animal welfare interestsmust be adequately r epresented. All appointments to the APC are announced publicly. When there is doubt about whether to licence a particular piece of work, the HomeSecretary may seek advice from the AnimalProcedures Committee or other independentassessors. The Home Secretary may refer othermatters to the Committee and the APC mayalso consider topics of its own choosing.Each year, the Committee makes a report onits activities to the Home Secretary and theNorthern Ireland Assembly Minister. Further information is available at www.apc.gov.uk A.3 Protection of Animals Act The welfare of domestic animal species issubject to the Protection of Animals Act 1911(1912 in Scotland), under the auspices ofDEFRA. The Act makes it an offence to causeunnecessary suffering to any domestic orcaptive animal, including: \u00b7 Administering poisonous or injurious substances without good reason; \u00b7 Permitting operations to be carried outwithout due care and humanity; Any procedure that is considered lawfulunder the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 cannot be classified as illegal under the 1911 Act. A.4 Licensing Under the 1986 Act researchers require botha personal and project licence to carry outregulated procedures on animals. i) Personal licences \u00b7The applicant must list the techniques thatthey planning to use (specifying each technique with a brief description), the typeof animal, and the establishment(s) atwhich they are working. 24 IFebruary 2004 I The use of non-human animals in researchAppendix 2: Statement of the Royal Society's position on the use of animals in research We have all benefited immensely from scientific research involving animals. From antibiotics and insulin to blood transfusionsand treatments for cancer or HIV, virtuallyevery medical achievement in the past centuryhas depended directly or indirectly on researchon animals. The same is true for veterinarymedicine. Modern biology, with all its contributions to the well-being of society, is heavily dependent on research on animals.Along with the great majority of the scientificcommunity, the Royal Society considers thatthe benefits provide the justification for theresearch that led to them. At the same time, the Society also recognises that special ethicalconsiderations are involved and that animalresearch must be undertaken only with the greatest care. All possible measures must be taken to minimise the suffering of animals used inresearch. The Society strongly endorses the principle of the 'three Rs' (which areenshrined in UK legislation). This means thatevery effort must be made: to replace theuse of live animals by non-animal alternatives;to reduce the number of animals used inresearch to the minimum required for meaningful results; and to refine the procedures so that the degree of suffering iskept to a minimum. Current UK legislation requires all researchers who propose to undertake laboratory or field work involving animals to give full consideration to the three Rs and to seekindependent advice from a local ethics committee. Researchers should seek, wherepossible, to avoid the use of animals andmust advance sound scientific arguments fortheir use, explaining in proposals for researchwhy no realistic alternative exists. The numberof animals used in an experiment must bethe minimum necessary to give a statisticallyvalid result. Using too few animals can be aswasteful as using too many, but numbers canbe kept down through good experimentaldesign. The Society believes that it is importantto ensure research is of the highest quality in every area of science. Such considerationsapply with special force where the lives andwelfare of animals are being considered. Allresearch on animals should, therefore, be subjected to rigorous independent peerreview in order to ensure the validity of both the approach and problem, and thereby promote an environment conducive to excellent science. The Society requires that the research it supports, in the UK or overseas, is carriedout in the spirit of the UK legislation as wellas complying with all local legislation andethical review procedures. For publication inthe Society's journals, papers describing workwith vertebrate animals will be accepted onlyif the procedures used are clearly describedand comply with the UK legislation. In addition, referees are required to expressany ethical concerns they may have aboutthe animal experimentation under review.Papers will be accepted for publication only ifthey are considered to be ethically sound. The Royal Society takes an active role in policy discussions on the use of animals in researchwith numerous bodies including government,funding agencies, charities and discussionforums. It provides support for internationalefforts to improve conditions for laboratory The use of non-human animals in research I February 2004 I 27The ERP has an important role in taking abroader view of the way animals are used inscience. It's function is to review the ethics ofthe proposed work and propose ways inwhich numbers can be reduced, the workrefined so as to reduce suffering, or consider ways in which the work might be done usingless sentient alternatives, and advise on thecare and accommodation of the animals. The recommendations that the ERPs makeare frequently cost/benefit analyses thatincorporate moral judgements, and it isimportant that the moral positions thatunderlie these decisions are made clear toresearchers. A.6 Legislation for genetically modified animals Animals that have been genetically modifiedare not considered any differently from anyother laboratory animal within the Animals(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. However,additional aspects of the welfare of geneticallymodified animals need to be taken into consideration. A hypothetical concern is thatthe introduction of a gene from a very different type of organism may lead tounforeseen interactions in development andthe emergence of animals that have seriouswelfare problems. Additionally, the targetingof genes in order to model human diseasestates or change patterns of growth may create welfare problems. One example is theenhanced expression of growth hormonewhich was engineered in the Beltsville pig,which developed gross abnormalities (Pursel et al 1989). Nevertheless, althoughgenetic modification is capable of generatingwelfare problems, no qualitative distinctionin terms of welfare can be made betweengenetic modification using modern geneticmodification technology or produced by artificial selection, chemicals or radiation.
