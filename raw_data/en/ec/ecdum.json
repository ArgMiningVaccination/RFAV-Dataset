We believe that there is no one \"right way\" to find healing. We also come from the perspective that wellness is achieved through tapping into multiple facets of a persons mind, body, and spiritual centers. We are convinced that the body holds innate wisdom for it's healing that can be accessed through attuning to it's messages. Our priority as a wellness team is to help guide individual's into deep self-awareness of their three centers, the body, mind, and spirit. Our vision is to optimize mental and emotional wellbeing through accessing the whole-person via nutrition, body movement, clearing stuck energy, and Psychotherapy. Goal \u2014 Long-term wellness Body therapy can feel foreign and intense at times; this is why we carefully attune to our clients \"window of tolerance\" (meaning the client should always feel safe and secure with whatever activity or discussion we are having) to make sure we are not doing too much too fast. Body-therapies are highly effective for most individuals. Working with the body also means attuning to the autonomic nervous system and automatic responses; moving our body out of fight/flight/freeze response opens up a pathway for long-term wellness. Meet the Clinical Director Sarah-Brooke Stiles, LCSW Clinical Director of Mind-Body Integrative Therapy License # 95317 What I have witnessed, and what I have learned along the way, all play a significant role in my integrative approach to therapy that focuses on the body-brain-spirit interconnection. I believe in leading by example - I vulnerably share with my clients that I personally have dealt with, and continue to heal from, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After ten-plus years of participating in talk-therapy with little-to-no tangible progress, I became deeply committed to pursuing therapy more holistically. Engaging in primarily body-based therapies and practices, such as; body sensation attunement/mapping, body movement, massage therapy, cranial-sacral therapy, connecting with nature, looking into nutrition essentials for mental health, mindfulness, meditative practices, brain spotting, internal family systems work, and other culturally / spiritually relevant practices that are individualized to my own unique path. This is where I have seen significant transformation, new thinking patterns, a deep sense of peace, connection, purpose, and a much healthier body! I am a lifetime learner and admirer of Peter Levine, Ph.D., Bessel van der Kolk, MD, and Ron Siegel. These men have been researching and articulating the physiological implications of trauma for many years. The body has it's own narrative, whether the subject matter is trauma, stress, anxiety, or depression. So much of traditional talk-therapy discounts the story/storage that is held in the body. This is why someone can spend countless years in therapy and have little to no real progress. It can be incredibly healing to tell the story that was swept under the rug, kept \"secret,\" or the \"shame of the family.\" The verbalization has its place but always in connection with the body's narrative. The body's story tells us the effects the past has on the present as it relates to our nervous system and automatic physiological responses to the here and now. Our brain, body, and spirit are interwoven; the experience/s that is stuck in mind, is also held in the body. Until these pieces integrate, we are often stuck in the past, stuck in worrying about the future, and missing the present. "}
