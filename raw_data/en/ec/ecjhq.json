This is an isotonic solution that helps increase our body's total fluid volume. Our bodies are made of 70% water and water is essential for all our body functions. We need adequate hydration to maintain the health of our organs, tissues, joints, skin, and immune system.

It plays an integral role in mitochondrial function (improves energy production, promotes heart and brain function, enhances muscle recovery), DNA repair (helps with aging and preventing disease progression), circadian rhythms (improved sleep cycles) and mitigating inflammation (decrease pain, increase immunity). Despite the prominent roll in our bodies, the amount of NAD+ decreases throughout the life cycle. Considering this fact, and that NAD+ is difficult to supplement in the diet, it is becoming a coveted IV Hydration treatment. Reasons for NAD+ treatment: \u00b7 Healthy Aging- NAD+ promotes cell regeneration, DNA repair, and can help slow cognitive decline. \u00b7 Fight Fatigue/Improve Energy: NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial function and generation of ATP the energy molecule of the body. \u00b7 Promote Muscle Health and Recovery: Mitochondrial function and ATP are required for muscle contraction, relaxation and cellular regeneration \u00b7 Strengthen Immune Health: NAD+ influences pro and anti-inflammatory cells and plays a role in resilience against immune system stressors \u00b7 Strengthen Metabolic Health: NAD+ supports healthy liver function and metabolism at the cellular level and helps improve glucose tolerance. \u00b7 Improve Mental Clarity and Mood: This is likely related to a combination of improved energy and enhanced brain function \u00b7 Get Better Sleep: NAD+ plays a roll in setting your circadian rhythm *NAD+ can be added independently in any infusion: in conjunction with other additives, or to upgrade the formulated specialty cocktails. +$100/dose (100mg) Medications: *May be added to any Reglan: (No additives) $85 Additives a Frequent Infusion Program! \u2014Purchase 5 infusions and either receive one dose of NAD+ free or receive a custom cocktail free OR a dose of NAD+ added to your infusion. \u2014Purchase 10 infusions and get a custom cocktail free AND one dose of NAD+ free.

WHAT TO EXPECT: You do not need to know what you would like at the time of scheduling! We can help you with your decision. A typical infusion will take 20-45 minutes. If you would like to add NAD+ to your infusion - the time will be longer (you may be with us for up to two hours). The time is longer and so worth it. The NAD+ when given quickly may make you nauseated...hence we can slow it down to make you more comfortable. Almost anyone will benefit from I.V.
