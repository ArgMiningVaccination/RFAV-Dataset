The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not state a preference for adjuvant ed*, high -dose or standard -dose flu vaccine for persons 65 years and older .1 How ever, there is evidence that high -dose and adjuvanted flu vaccine s are more effective than standard -dose , unadjuvanted vaccine in preventing medically -attended, lab -confirmed influenza infection in this population . If multiple vaccine products are available and another adjuvanted vaccine is not planned for the visit , the Washington Vaccine Advisory Committee recommends that healthcare providers offer high -dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine to patients 65 years of age or older . Flublok Quadrivalent, a vaccine available in the 2019 -20 influenza season with higher efficacy rates than standard dose flu vaccine , may also be considered for older adults. Given unknown but theoretical concerns of increased reactogenicity when administering two adjuvant ed vaccines, selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered when influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a novel adjuvant are administered at the same time.1 Examples of vaccines containing a novel adjuvant include Shingrix and He plisav -B. Vaccination should not be delayed if a specific product is not available and another opportunity to vaccinat e the patient before the end of October is uncertain . *An adjuv ant is a substance that enhances the body's immune response to a vaccine Summary of i mmunogenicity and clinical efficacy/ effectiveness data : Fluzone High -Dose - Contains four times more antigen than the standard -dose flu vaccine and has been shown to produce a higher antibody response than standard -dose vaccine in older adults.2-3 o One randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of high - vs. standard -dose flu vaccine showed the high -dose vaccine had 24% greater efficacy against any lab -confirmed influenza infection compared to standard -dose flu vaccine (95% CI: 9.7% -36.5%). Based on this study, the high -dose vaccine would prevent about 5 additional cases of lab -confirmed influenza for every 1000 peop le vaccinated.4 o A separate study among those living in long -term care facilities reported high -dose flu vaccine was associated with a lower risk of respiratory -related hospital admissions comp ared with standard -dose vaccine .5 o Recent meta -analyse s showed that high -dose inactivated influenza vaccine was more likely than standard dose vaccine to prevent influenza and its complication s.6-7 FLUAD - Approved through accelerated -approval process in November 2015 ,8-9 FLUAD is the first adjuvanted flu vaccine marketed in the United States and was FDA licensed for use 2 starting in the 2016 -17 flu season . o Studies have shown that FLUAD induce s antibody levels similar to those induced by flu vaccine without adjuvant.8 o One case -control study performed in Canada during the 2011 -12 season showed that FLUAD was significantly more effective at preventing lab -confirmed influenza infection in older adults compared to a trivalent vaccine without an adjuvant.10 o A recent systematic review and meta -analysis show ed that adjuvanted influenza vaccine is more effective than unadjuvanted vaccine at preventing influenza -related complications.11 Flublok Quadrivalent - A randomized trial was conducted in 201 4-2015 that showed Flublok Quadrivalent was more efficacious tha n standard dose flu vaccine. o The relative vaccine efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent compared with standard dose flu vaccine was 30% (95% CI: 10-47). When restricted to persons aged 65 years, the relative vaccine efficacy was 17% (95% CI: -20% -43%). o Flublok Quadrivalent is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs, and may be used for persons with severe egg allergy.1 Summary of s afety data Fluzone High -Dose - Recipients of high -dose influenza vaccine more commonly report mild and/ or moderat e side effects than recipients of standard -dose influenza vaccine .13 The most common adverse events have been mild and temporary, and include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, headache, myalgia , fever and malaise.5 FLUAD - Some adv erse events are reported more frequentl y after vaccination with FLUAD than vaccines without adjuvants. The most common adverse events experienced during clinical studies were mild to moderate , and included pain, redness at the injectio n site, headache, muscle aches , and malaise .8 Flublok Quadrivalent - The most common (10%) injection site reactions were tenderness (48%) and pain (37%); the most common (10%) solicited systemic adverse reactions were (20%), fatigue (17%), myalgia (13%) and arthralgia ( 10%). The safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two novel adjuvant -containing vaccines such as FLUAD , Shingrix and Heplisav B has not been evaluated, and the ideal interval between vaccines is not known. Vaccines with newer adjuvants should be administered at separate sites from other vaccines that are given simultaneously. 1 References 1CDC.
