The 8.5 million hospitalizations involving patients with mental illness represented almost 22 percent of the overall 39.5 million hospitalizations in 2006. Of those hospitalizations specifically for treatment of a mental disorder: n Nearly 730,000 involved depression or other mood disorders, such as bipolar disease. n Approximately 381,000 were the result of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. n Approximately 131,000 were related to delirium, dementia, amnesia or other cognitive problems. n Roughly 76,000 involved anxiety disorders and adjustment disorders \u2014 stress-related illnesses that can affect feeling, thoughts and behaviors. n About 34,000 involved attention-deficit disorder, disruptive behavior, impulse control, personality disorders or mental disorders usually diagnosed in infancy or later childhood.

I trust that it has been a time of good cheer, joy, renewal and connection, accompanied by long stretches of true peace. I also recognize that the holidays can be very difficult for many of us \u2014 a time filled with sadness about loved ones lost or missing, immeasurable hours and days filled with loneliness and, perhaps, a deep sense of emptiness and regret. To those who have a difficult time during the holidays, I hope the promise of a new year and the pledge for positive change will provide you with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. As the calendar gets set to change, I customarily settle back and write down my New Year's resolutions. This year was no different, except this time I wrote two lists \u2014 a personal list and one that I will apply in my role as president of the American Counseling Association. I was afraid that listing my top 10 resolutions would somehow give the impression that one took precedent over another, and that is just not the case, so I have designated each as \"No. 1.\" Each of these resolutions is important to me and, I believe, important to the health and well-being of our great organization. So, without further delay, my list of resolutions for my remaining service as ACA president: 1. Continue our efforts to become the premier organization and hope to professional counselors, both nationally and globally. 1. Continue our steadfast commitment to issues of social justice and to serving as advocates for all those who are disenfranchised, marginalized or oppressed. 1. Continue our efforts to increase public awareness about who counselors are and what services we provide. 1. Continue to seek alternative revenue streams and remain prudent and attentive to our commitment to financial solvency. 1. Continue to advocate and lobby for our members who are private practitioners by seeking parity and better working environments, and offer workshops/seminars/continuing education opportunities specifically designed to meet the needs of our members in private practice. 1. Continue our efforts to obtain licensure in California. 1. Continue our efforts as leaders to be transparent about our decisions and nimble and collaborative in our governance. 1. Continue our efforts to develop a viable and dynamic strategic plan that will serve us both now and into the future. 1. Continue our efforts and plans to bring 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling to fruition. 1. Continue our efforts to deliver meaningful and practical services to you, our members. In closing, I wish you all the hope and promise that a new year can bring, and I look forward to our continued journey.

I wish all of you a peaceful, healthy, rewarding and transforma- tive year. While this is my first column of 2009, it also concludes a three-part effort that began with what I shared in Novem-ber. My previous two columns focused on \"change\" and \"giving,\" respectively. This column addresses \"belonging.\" I believe most people would acknowl- edge that they \"belong\" to something \u2014 a family, a professional organization, a service group, a school. I am of course interested in what you and your colleagues value in your professional organizations. My sense is that you would belong to an organization that promotes your profes-sion, provides resources to the profession, teaches about the profession's ethical standards and advocates on behalf of the profession. Belonging to the American Counseling Association is all of those things \u2014 and much, much more. Belonging to ACA creates a community of like-minded, well-intentioned, dedicated professionals who come together to enhance, improve and professionalize the art and science of professional counseling. Think about it. For an investment of about 43 cents per day, professional counselors receive the full benefit package offered by ACA (it is only 25 cents per day for students and retirees). And for just a few more pennies per day, one can also increase the value of membership by joining any of our 19 divi- sions (which many thousands of you have already done!). However, it is my belief that you will only want to belong to an organization in which you see value. With the changes in the world economy, many people are cut-ting back on what they spend. My obser- vation is that this cutting back is done to preserve the ability to purchase services or American Counseling Association President Colleen R.

Once again, we see that change (in this case relative to the economy) affects what we give (to those organizations with which we feel a special affinity), with the result being that we belong to those organizations that resonate with who we are as caring and professional people. When we embrace change and give of our time and limited resources, we also receive the benefit of belonging. ACA continues to look at what we need to do to change in the current environment, but we also try to look five, 10, even 20 years into the future. We will only be a vital, useful, beneficial organization to our members if we change to meet needs, provide the best possible services and benefits, and nurture a community that welcomes those who wish to belong. I encourage you to bring your colleagues and students to our table. Let others know of the good things ACA has done, is doing and will be doing as we transition into the second decade of the 21st century. Quite simply, those who identify as professional counselors need to belong to ACA. While we are 40,000 strong, we have not even engaged one-quarter of those who identify as professional counselors in the United States, and when you think about coun-selors around the world, the percentage is even smaller. We have been changing things in \"our house\" and refocusing our efforts to provide the best services and benefits pos-sible. Now what we need to do (with your help) is to let others know that we would be honored to have them belong to our organization. So, as we begin a new year, I ask that every ACA member bring at least one or two new people to our table. If you need information about ACA member-ship, services and benefits, contact us; we will be happy to provide you with these materials or even send them directly to a colleague, student or friend. Let's make this a banner year for those who will say, \"I BELONG to the Ameri- can Counseling Association.\" I hope you will contact me with any comments, questions or suggestions that you might have. Please contact me via e-mail at ryep@counseling.org or by phone at 800.347.6647 ext. 231. Thanks and be well. u Changing, giving, belongingLetters 8 | Counseling T oday | January 2009Another option to help counselors nurture creativity How exciting to see the upsurge of interest in the creative arts in counseling as reflected in the November issue of Counseling Today. \"Creating connection, crafting wellness\" gives us a glimpse of how effective working with the arts can be with a broad array of issues and populations. To the list of organizations involved with creative therapies that was provided on page 37, I would like to add the International Expressive Arts Therapy Association (ieata.org). This international association may be of particular interest to counselors because this field emphasizes creativity and integration of all the arts rather than focusing on a particular arts modality. Interested practitioners with appropriate training and experience also can seek registration as a Registered Expressive Arts Therapist or a Registered Expressive Arts Consultant/Educator through IEATA. Sally Atkins, Coordinator, and the Expressive Arts Faculty at Appalachian State University Boone, N.C. Reader questions article on eating disorders, body image I enjoyed Mike Hovancsek's article \"Ghost in the machine\" in the November issue. Certainly, counselors, our clients and society as a whole would benefit greatly if we avoided television and other media and read or moved instead. The article points out a couple of issues, however, that deserve comment. The article mentions that the average woman in the United States is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds. The inference is that because it is \"average,\" it must be normal or at least acceptable. When this statistic is considered in light of the epidemic of people who are overweight or obese, this is not necessarily a reasonable inference. The National Center for Health Statistics has the same average height (actually 5 feet 3.7 inches tall) but says the average weight is 167 pounds, which is up from 152 pounds just 10 years ago. But even the 140 pounds may indicate a significant weight problem depending on the individual's body type. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that women ages 20 to 29 were 29 pounds heavier in 2002 than in 1960. The surgeon general has recently addressed childhood obesity as a significant health hazard in the United States. The many problems related to childhood obesity include sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, asthma, Type II diabetes and a much greater probability of adult obesity. The article also states that \"conservative estimates suggest that after puberty, 5 million to 10 million girls and women\" have eating disorders, but it does not explain how these \"conservative estimates\" arrive at such a wide range. Even if we accept the most liberal end of the range (10 million), that works out to less than 1 percent of the total U.S. population. It is hard to reconcile this statistic with the assertion expressed in the article that anorexia nervosa is one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses in young women. Most counselors would probably estimate anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant disorders or some sort of affective disorder as being much more common than eating disorders. Please understand that I am in no way detracting from the seriousness of the diagnosis. I am simply saying that, as counselors, we should be more rigorous in our use of data and not merely use unquestioned statistics as \"proof texts\" to bolster arguments or favored positions. In addition, the article takes a purely Western cultural approach toward eating disorders. There is, however, a multicultural component to this issue. We know this from the research that addresses the occurrence of eating disorders in other cultures \u2014 including cultures in which the television or other media have not played a prominent role. The article also takes an allopathic medical approach. The medical model is simple: Look for disease, find the disease, label the disease, then prescribe an intervention (which, in the case of the medical model, is usually medication when it comes to mental, emotional or behavioral problems). This is not a very useful model for counselors, yet it is unfortunately far too often the approach that is taken and encouraged.Robert NelsonCorpus Christi, T exas Author's response: While any individual study can be questioned, the preponderance of research on this subject reaches the same conclusion: There are a lot of unhealthy messages in the media, and they are strongly correlated with unhealthy body image issues in society. This is further backed up by reports from individual clients who are seeking help for body image problems. Even if all of this research is disputed, however, it can't possibly hurt to teach our clients how to use good critical thinking skills when they encounter ideas that cause them to feel depressed, anxious or inferior. These interventions do not need to be \"prepackaged.\" There is plenty of room for innovation and creativity in the counseling field. u Letters policy Counseling Today welcomes letters to the editor.

The elec-tion also will usher in a new and increas-ingly Democratic Congress. With one race yet to be decided as of press time (a recount in Minnesota), the Senate will consist of 56 Democrats, 41 Republicans and two independents who usually caucus with the Democrats. A Republican victo-ry in a Dec. 2 runoff election in Georgia means that the Democrats will come up just short of reaching the 60-vote major-ity usually required for approving legisla-tion in the Senate. The new House of Representatives will consist of at least 256 Democrats and at least 175 Republicans; the precise party division of the House won't be known until Dec. 6 at the earli- est, when two races in Louisiana will be decided and after recounts in one district apiece in California and Ohio. Job No. 1 for both President Obama and Congress will be reinvigorating the nation's economy. Congressional leaders have already announced that in a break with tradition, members of the 111th Congress will be put to work immedi- ately after being sworn in on Jan. 6, with the goal of having an economic recovery plan ready for Obama around the time he takes office on Jan. 20. House and Senate members are likely to be working throughout January instead of beginning work in earnest around the end of the month, as is the norm. Huge federal government outlays for economic recovery will deplete resources for spending on other issues. At virtually the same time that Obama was discussing the need for major government invest-ments to spur growth and create jobs, he was also stressing the importance of scour- ing the federal budget to \"make meaning-ful cuts and sacrifices.\" Advocates for big increases in public spending on social pro- grams likely will be disappointed.Nonetheless, 2009 is likely to see much activity concerning health care issues, including major, systemic private sector health care reform and significant up- grades in both Medicare and Medicaid programs. Recently, Democrats have been more receptive to a strong public role in guiding and supporting health care services, and with a Democratic presi- dent and larger majorities in Congress, lawmakers are expected to prioritize work in this area. The American Counseling Association will be following this work closely, looking for opportunities to help establish more complete recognition of the counseling profession. As mentioned in last month's Washington Update, Medicare legislation will be high on the agenda for 2009, with a Jan. 1, 2010, deadline looming for forestalling deep physician pay cuts. ACA's policy objectives typically play out within legislative committees and with individual offices. As a result, the full impact of the elections on our work won't be known until more dust has settled. It is also important to note that the core issues facing the counseling profession are not partisan; both Repub- licans and Democrats have recently been honored with ACA's Federal Legislative Service Award. ACA respects and values the diverse spectrum of political ideology among its members and does not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 explicitly support any single political party. Communicating with Congress: Lessons from recent research One certainty regarding 2009 is that for the counseling profession to achieve its policy objectives, counselors will need to increase their level of involvement and advocacy. ACA is working hard to discuss the profession's needs and how federal programs can more appropriately recog- nize and utilize counselors in providing services. Members of Congress and agen-cies within the Obama administration will be much more receptive, however, if they hear from you! There will be stagger-ing demands on lawmakers' time, energy and money; we will need to advocate strongly and effectively to be heard. ACA is working to improve the size and strength of our grassroots advocacy ef- forts, and on Nov. 20, we hosted an hour- long conference call with counselors from across the country. During this call, we heard from an analyst with the Congres-sional Management Foundation on the current state of communications between constituents and members of Congress. Thirty years ago, no one e-mailed his or her member of Congress. Today, millions of Americans do. What many people don't realize is that members of Congress have virtually the same number of staff today as they did in the 1970s, despite the explosion of the telecommunications industry and the growth of the U.S. pop- ulation by roughly one-third. The flood of communications reaching congressio- nal offices means that form e-mails and letters no longer work. Congress has had enough of them. The good news is that lawmakers are still hungry for information about what their constituents really think, and on most issues, even a small number of contacts can make a big difference. To be effective, however, contacts need to be individualized. ACA members can learn more by listening to the presentation; files containing the audio of the call and the associated PowerPoint presentation will be posted on the ACA public policy web-site at counseling.org/publicpolicy. ACA needs grassroots support to ex- perience success on the policy initiatives we're pushing on behalf of the counseling profession. We thank those counselors who are already involved and encourage others to join in! uACA postelection update: The tide changesJanuary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 11 The six-hour workshops are facilitated by either Catherine Rains, (formerly Catherine Holmes), M.S.; Sherrie six-hour workshops are designed for career counselors and academic advisors who support college and high school students, as well as all practitioners who help adults with career decisions.

At the Rocky Mountain Association for Counselor Education and Supervision conference in Breckenridge, Colo., this past October, I had the pleasure of meeting Carol Bobby. She was most pleasant and warm, and I had hoped to convince her to write an ar-ticle for The Top Five. Bobby is the em- bodiment of leadership in the counseling field, and I was thrilled when she agreed to write an installment for us. As a Licensed Professional Counselor in Virginia, Carol has served as the executive director of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) for an astounding 20 years. An American Counseling As- sociation member and a past Chi Sigma Iota (CSI) president, she has held a multi-tude of leadership positions within higher education (regrettably, far too many for me to list here). In 2006, Carol was awarded the ACA Arthur A. Hitchcock Distinguished Professional Service Award. What follows is her article providing tips for all of us on becoming more effective leaders. w Carol Bobby On Nov. 4, 2008, the United States elected a new president. The results of this election have been called historic, and the campaign itself energized Ameri- can voters in a way not witnessed for many years. The call for leadership that could change the course of our country was undeniable. The job of the candidates was to convince voters that they had the skills to accomplish this. The importance of good leadership is not limited to the presidency. Businesses, schools and sports teams all need good leaders. The counseling profession is no different. Strong leadership in our profes- sion has given us licensure in 49 of 50 states, a highly respected accrediting or- ganization (CACREP) and a globally rec- ognized credentialing body (the National Board for Certified Counselors). Yet pro- fessional challenges still exist with regard to managed care, insurance reimburse-ments and meeting the counseling needs of a global and multicultural society. Continued leadership is a must, and to-day's counseling students need to develop leadership skills. So what makes someone a good or effective leader? While there is ample research on leadership styles and qualities, the following five recommenda- tions come from personal experience. 1. Be flexible. Murphy's Law states that if something can go wrong, it will. I learned this in 1993, the year of my CSI presidency. Although the business meet- ing in Atlanta had been meticulously planned, a blizzard paralyzed the city the day before. Hotel personnel could not get to work. Food could not be served. Presenters were stranded at home. Those who made it to the meeting looked to me to determine the day's outcome. Mustering my courage, I asked everyone to \"go with the flow.\" Although we were a small group, business was conducted and awards were presented (albeit with- out reception food). Those who were at the ACA Conference in Atlanta still talk about the camaraderie that developed among those trapped in the city. If your plans cannot be followed, don't panic or try to force the plan into action. If you are flex- ible, others will follow your lead. 2. Know when to follow. Good lead- ers realize the importance of listening carefully to the ideas and wishes of their constituents \u2014 including those constitu- ents who do not support them. As Barack Obama said on election night, \"And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote to- night, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president, too.\" These are important words to remember. Several years ago, I was active in an organization for which the board chair had a personal agenda for change. The more she pushed her agenda, the more resistance she encountered. She had great ideas but, sadly, they simply had not been vetted in a manner that allowed for devel-opment of group ownership. I suggested she consider a membership retreat with roundtable discussions. A remarkable thing happened. Some of the roundtables came up with the exact ideas previously pushed for by the chair. Once the group owned the need for change and set goals for themselves, the leadership could assist in effecting the change. Learning to listen to the ideas of others can allow leadership to assist in planning for change. 3. Make fairness a priority. In 2008, there were many discussions about how to heal a divided nation. Differing views on key issues can become volatile, espe-cially when one group feels unheard. As chair-elect of a higher education orga-nization, I saw just how divided an as-sociation could become as people aligned themselves on opposite sides of the room to argue their side of the issue. The cur-rent chair worked hard to facilitate dis-cussion as shots were volleyed across the room. With no resolution in sight, the discussion was tabled to the next meeting. Dreading the conflict that would be \"brought off the table\" during my first meeting as chair, I considered ways to provide a fair and open hearing of the members' concerns. I decided to host a debate. Debate team rules were followed with the assistance of a moderator; how-ever, it was stated up front that no winner would be declared and that the purpose of the debate was to allow thorough and thoughtful discussion from all members. The debate was a success and the mem-bership was reunited. Regardless of how a leader feels about an issue, the leader must ensure that all sides are treated fairly and with integrity. 4. Communicate effectively. Com- munication requires making a sincere connection with your listeners. Past presi-dents have attempted to do this through venues such as \"fireside chats\" and \"town hall meetings.\" Others have used engag-ing phrases, such as \"My fellow Ameri-cans.\" Still others have spoken with direct earnestness, as did Ronald Reagan when he said in his 1987 speech in West Berlin, The Top Five - With Mark Reiser A call to leadership Carol BobbyJanuary 2009 | Recovery\u00ae Certification Training Program Learn The Action Program for Helping Grievers Deal with Loss column editor for The T op Five and a doctoral student in the University of Wyoming Counselor Education Department. Contact him at reiser@uwyo.edu to comment on this column or to recommend other counseling professionals he could feature in upcoming issues. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org\"Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" At a CACREP Board meeting, I was privileged to see the positive effect of well thought out communication when the chair of an ad hoc committee on board restructuring outlined (ala Dave Letterman) the \"top 10 reasons\" for CA-CREP to vote in favor of a new board structure and selection process. The communication was clear, succinct and convincing. Effective communication oc-curs when you are sincere in your message and engage your listeners as individuals who have an important role in the process. 5. Remember the importance of humor. Dwight Eisenhower once said, \"A sense of humor is part of the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done.\" When used ap- propriately, humor can engage an audi- ence. It can relieve stress. It can allow people to see an issue in a new light. Over the 20-plus years that I have worked with the CACREP Board, I have seen how humor assists this group of hardworking professionals to complete difficult tasks. Jokes abound regarding the \"huge boxes of love\" (i.e., self-study reports) that the staff sends to them for review. Humor also helps this group of 14 to get through three full days of meeting together twice per year in often windowless rooms. Finally, I have learned that cartoons can convey important concerns regarding budget, personnel or other business concerns. Inserting these cartoons in the text of my Executive Director's Report creates interest while making important points. Humor can be an important icebreaker in tense situa-tions. It can allow your audience to identify and laugh with you. It also allows for fresh views of old situations, which may assist you in meeting your goals. u14 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 The October 2008 edition of Counselor Career Stories focused on a counselor who often works with clients affected by rural poverty. Not long after publication, I received a letter from American Counseling Association member Sabina Remmers de Vries expressing appreciation for the article's subject matter. She went on to write about her own work with the homeless population in San Antonio, adding that she felt America's homeless were often treated like the \"untouchables\" in India. The comment saddened and intrigued me so much that I called Sabina to discuss her work. I soon realized her story needed to be told. Rebecca Daniel-Burke: Tell me about your current counseling position. Sabina Remmers de Vries: I work part time for an agency that serves the homeless, and I also have a part-time private practice. RDB: What lead you to serve the homeless population? SRDV: I worked in the medical field for years. I decided to go back to school as I continued working part time in the medical field. I decided to get a master's degree in counseling and was looking for a practicum. This professor \u2014 who became my mentor \u2014 knew that I wanted to work someplace where I could have an impact. He suggested this agency that had contracts to serve the homeless. I ended up doing my practicum there, also my internship, and then they hired me. I am still there and have been there since 2003. We serve all of the homeless in San Antonio, Texas. Most are in some type of shelter. But anyone without a stable residence or in a transitional shelter or in a dual-diagnosis/homeless program can qualify to receive our services. RDB: What is a typical day like for you when you work with the homeless? SRDV: I go to shelters around San Antonio. There are about 20 shelters, and the last count of homeless individuals in the San Antonio area was between 20,000 and 25,000. About 40 percent are families with children. RDB: So first you arrive at one of these shelters. Then what? SRDV: I may visit two to three shelters in a day. Sometimes the shelter calls, and sometimes the homeless person calls. I arrive at a shelter and see if there is a private place to meet, and there never is. We might sit at the dining room table, we might go for a walk, we might go to McDonald's or go to a park. One woman called and said, \"I am going to be down by the river,\" so I went there. RDB: So you meet the client where they are? SRDV: Yes, I do.RDB: How does the counseling begin?SRDV: I know I need to connect quickly. These people are not interested in a middle-class or upper-middle-class thing called \"counseling\"; they want food on the table and a bed tonight. I am an Adlerian believer. I approach each individual from a level of equality. We are just two human beings talking. I listen, I validate and I show empathy. I might say, \"I know everyone else is in power and they are telling you what to do. That is not how we will be. This counseling session is for you. It can be whatever you want it to be.\" I went through my counseling graduate program and thought I was psychodynamic, but these people taught me to use empathic listening. I discovered Rogers through this population. RDB: And it is Rogers who says we have to meet people where they are, right? SRDV: Right. I say, \"We are equals here. I am not one of 'them.' I am here for you.\" That is when they start trusting me and the work begins. RDB: What then?SRDV: Once we get some of the food and shelter concerns resolved for the near future, they might move deeper in our work. They might say, \"I can't sleep. I have these terrible dreams.\" That is an opening to move into deeper work. It sounds like an exaggeration, but 95 percent of the homeless individuals I have counseled have experienced some trauma early in life. Often in my beginning work with people in shelters, they are mandated to see me. But sometimes they get a taste for talking when someone is deeply listening. They may then call and ask me to come see them again instead of the shelter calling. RDB: Do you do any groups at the shelters? SRDV: Yes. I used to run a huge group at a shelter, but HUD (the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) became more and more rigorous with the funding, and I had to fill out so much paperwork and have the clients fill out so much paperwork that I finally stopped doing that group. It just feels wrong to hand a traumatized person a pile of paper to fill out before I help them. RDB: It is sad that paperwork has come to this. SRDV: I agree. I know my time is better used counseling people than filling out reams of paperwork. I also teach an 11-week course on conflict resolution at a shelter. RDB: Tell me more about that group.SRDV: Some homeless people have learned that an aggressive tactic works. If they behave in a menacing way, people will leave them alone. RDB: They have created a feedback loop?Meeting the homeless where they areCounselor Career Stories - By Rebecca Daniel-Burke Sabina Remmers de VriesJanuary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 15 back this up, but there is an uncommonly large representation of the bipolar diagnosis among the homeless. This is often discussed at community coalition meetings. I am doing some research at this time with my mentor to gather findings regarding the unusually large representation of this diagnosis among the homeless. RDB: I wonder if they have done their relationships in \u2014 exhausted their significant others through mania and mood swings? SRDV: Many are in a relationship, but the relationships are stormy. Sometimes I think there is always trauma, and the trauma is very often co-occurring with the bipolar symptoms. I ask myself which came first: the trauma, the homelessness or the bipolar diagnosis? In the battered women's shelter, I see many diagnosed with bipolar. I think we are seeing a stress response to trauma and emotional abuse. RDB: I wonder if the domestic violence outbursts are similar to the out- of-control feeling of the manic mood swing for people with a bipolar diagnosis? SRDV: That is a very interesting thought. That definitely could be a part of the whole situation. RDB: What have homeless people taught you? SRDV: First, they have taught me that they are more vulnerable than most in terms of sensitivities. They are not the criminals. The criminals won't come to the shelter. They are more exploitive and will take what they need. The homeless have also taught me how little we actually need. It's all about relationships. Nothing else matters. That is what they have taught me. RDB: Was there someone who saw something special in you, who helped you along your career path? SRDV: That one professor, Dr. Valadez, my mentor. He saw my engagement with homeless people. He always encouraged me and supported me in my work. RDB: Do you have a theoretical hero, a theorist who inspires you? SRDV: In my work, and being from Europe, I am inspired by the big three: Freud, Jung and Adler. Everything has a meaning and purpose. But I am mostly inspired by others not in our field. RDB: Like who?SRDV: Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama both inspire me deeply. Mother Teresa had a saying that went something like this: If you love until it hurts, it doesn't hurt anymore, and the only thing left is love. I believe you have to push beyond the misery, tolerate it and move beyond it; what is left is love and caring for the other. RDB: Is there anything I have not asked that you want our readers to know about your story? SRDV: Yes, working with the homeless and sexual abuse survivors today is very difficult because of funding cuts. Also, under the banner of accountability is a continuous increase in paperwork. That is why I had to disband that one group. We are seeing fewer clients and doing more paperwork \u2014 so much more paperwork that it decreases our productivity with those who need us. This part needs to be turned around. RDB: Thank you, Sabina, for doing this important work. w ACA values the opportunity to honor the career paths of working counselors with Counselor Career Stories. The hope is that the career lessons these counselors share each month will be very helpful to working counselors and students alike as they seek employment and career fulfillment. For additional assistance with career and employment issues, visit the ACA Career Center at counseling.org/ CareerCenter/, where you can also view current online job listings, CareerBuilder and state and federal employment lists. uSRDV: Exactly, so I work with them on setting boundaries before the aggression kicks in. We ease slowly into topics about anger management and goal setting. I try to set it up so they ask for those topics rather than always dictating what will happen in the group. Again, they have most workers telling them what to do. They need to feel differently in my group \u2014 feel like I am listening, not dictating. RDB: What do our readers need to know about counseling the homeless? SRDV: First, we all have stereotypes before we meet a homeless individual. \"They are dirty, unwashed and living under a bridge\" might be our first thought. If you move beyond that stereotype, there is a human being. They are not one group. Rather, it is a very diverse set of groups with many parts. They are mothers and children running away from domestic violence. These mothers would rather be out on the streets than be killed by their abusers. They are homeless adolescents who are survivors of sexual abuse or bullying, or both. There are gay adolescents who have been rejected by their families. A type of interpersonal trauma exists for members of each of the groups. The residue of that trauma gets in the way of functioning in society. There are some young male homeless single fathers with children, and there is no shelter for that group. There is a large population of homeless people with health issues. They got sick and have lost everything to the illness, and they are trying to get their medical needs met. RDB: Do you mean HIV/AIDS? SRDV: No, there are lots of programs for (those cases) and lots of funding for them. But if someone has lost their job and apartment due to cancer or back problems, there is no specific funding for them. RDB: What about veterans?SRDV: The VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) takes care of veterans for the most part, although they sometimes have to wait too long for service at the VA. There are also other agencies, both federal and private, with money to treat veterans. RDB: What about the mentally ill homeless person? SRDV: Many have a diagnosis of bipolar.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org16 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 Tips for a top career Now is the time of year when those close to graduation start gearing up for the big transition. It's the hurdle every counseling student throughout time has faced \u2014 becoming a new professional. While the prospects are exciting, it is not always easy saying goodbye to the classroom and hello to \"real world\" counseling. New graduates often worry about their professional path and where it will lead. The first New Perspectives column for 2009 focuses on these concerns, featuring tips on getting ahead from mental health professionals at various stages of their ca- reer. The January expert responders are: n Brian Montalvo, a new professional with five years of experience. He is as- sistant director for career development and career education at Florida Atlantic University and a frequent contributor to National Career Development As- sociation publications. n Perry C. Francis, a 10-plus-year veteran in counseling education, associate pro- fessor of counseling and coordinator of counseling services at Eastern Michigan University. He has published numerous articles and held leadership positions in the American College Counseling Association. n Robert Wubbolding, professor emeritus at Xavier University, director of the Center for Reality Therapy and direc- tor of training at the William Glasser Institute. He has more than 40 years of counseling experience, has written numerous books, including Real-ity Therapy in the 21st Century, and introduced reality therapy internation-ally into areas such as Korea, Japan, Singapore and Kuwait. w Q: What should new graduates do to have a successful, long-term career? Brian Montalvo: There are six steps I would suggest that a new graduate take. New Perspectives - With Donjanea L. Fletcher First, read everything and anything related to your counseling specialty. Second, write often for counseling- related journals, magazines, newsletters, blogs and websites. Writing will help you organize your thoughts, which in turn will help you become more lucid with your clients. Third, don't be afraid to leave your comfort zone. Challenge yourself regu-larly. It's the only way to achieve profes- sional growth and development. For me, this meant presenting at national confer-ences. If you're not comfortable with the national stage, start with local and state presentations. Next, join and be active in professional associations. Network with current mem- bers, attend the conferences and read the literature they produce. The counseling profession is similar to a river: It may look like the same body of water, but in reality, it's constantly changing. Being active with professional associations is one of the best ways to stay afloat. The fifth suggested step is to begin and nourish relationships with individu-als (\"mentors\") who have experience and knowledge in your specialty. Mentors are your guiding light. Use them often and wisely! (For more on this topic, read \"Making the most of the mentoring rela-tionship\" on p. 52.) Finally, I would recommend staying connected and in tune with the world. Read your local newspaper daily and a national newspaper weekly. Current events can influence our clients' needs and moods. Absorb information like a new- born. Even information that you perceive to be meaningless, you never know when it will come in handy! Perry C. Francis: The first of many activities that will help in your success as a counselor following graduation is finding a good supervisor with whom you can work. While you have completed your degree and are now considered able to start prac-ticing as a professional counselor, you do so as a beginner. Depending on your state, you will now be required to complete post-degree supervised hours. Having a good supervisor is paramount because you will work with that person for about two years. A good supervisor is not just a counselor with experience whom the state recog- nizes as a supervisor. A good supervisor is someone with the appropriate education (a graduate course and supervised experi- ence in supervision is most desirable) and counseling experience within the specialty in which you are practicing. It does you no good to be practicing in a college setting and to be supervised by someone who has only school counseling experience. Addi-tionally, you need someone whom you can trust and who can trust in you. As in any counseling relationship, this trust builds over time and develops and changes as the counselor develops and changes. A second activity that will be helpful as you grow both as a counselor and an entre-preneur is developing an \"elevator speech\" \u2014 a very short speech that describes, in a professional manner, who you are and what you do \u2014 that can be delivered to anyone who asks, usually as you hand them your business card. In this way, you can advocate for the profession and, at the same time, develop business/client con-tacts as you grow your practice. Robert Wubbolding: It is safe to say that every student of counseling or every employed counselor wants a job or wants to keep a job. The question is how to accomplish these goals and, even more, how to have a meaningful career. A more specific goal could be the motto of St. Ed-ward's School in Romsey, England: \"Make yourself necessary.\" The following 10 tips aim at achieving these goals. First, get along with your coworkers. Successful employees have healthy inter- personal relationships. Next, remember that your job is not to do merely what your salary demands. Your January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 17 job is to do more than the minimum. In other words, when you find a job, keep looking for work. Third, realize that in addition to doing good work, your job is to make the school or agency look good in the community, and then give others the credit. Fourth, develop a specialty. Learn all you can about a specific topic. Someday the world will beat a path to your door to learn from you. Fifth tip, learn everything there is to know about your school or agency: its his-tory, how it is funded, the clients served, the neighborhood, etc. Sixth, read the literature in your profes- sion. Good salespeople \"know their terri-tory.\" You are selling mental health. Learn all you can about it. Next, read outside your professional field. Develop interests outside your job. For some people, this might be easy \u2014 in fact, too easy. Balance this suggestion with the previous tip. Tip number eight, never, ever, never, ever communicate to your clients that they are victims. They have strengths and opportunities. Help them accept their strengths and use their opportuni-ties. Acceptance of clients does not equal agreement. The next to last suggestion is to find out what your supervisor, executive director or administrator wants. Help them achieve it. If this violates your ethical values, you have a decision to make. Finally, each day spend one minute ask- ing yourself, \"What did I do well today?\" and \"What do I need to improve on?\" Avoid any hint of self-criticism. If you've read this far, thank you. What human being doesn't enjoy being asked for his or her opinion? You've asked for mine. Oh, yes! One final suggestion: Evaluate the 10 suggestions, take what's useful, and if any of them doesn't fit you, simply discard it. u Donjanea L.

Walsh and Norman C. Dasenbrook Q: Do you know how the mental health parity legislation will be implemented with our clients with current group health insurance coverage \u2014 i.e. (Blue Cross) annual outpatient session limits or 20 to 50 percent copay when other medical services have $20 copay? Dare we hope it could change? A: We consulted Scott Barstow, director of public policy and legislation for the American Counseling Association, and Rachel M. Milazzo, manager of provider relations for American Behavioral, a managed care company. They gave us the following report. Scott Barstow writes: Counselors and their clients took a big stride forward on Oct. 3 with the enactment of a mental health and addictive disorder parity law. The law is expected to improve health insurance coverage of counselors and other mental health professionals because it will prohibit many current aspects of health plan policies that restrict access to care. However, the law does not include any language specifically referencing or affecting any individual type of mental health professional and, consequently, is unlikely to improve recognition of Licensed Professional Counselors relative to other types of health care professionals. It should also be remembered that health plans will continue to be able to utilize standard managed care plan practices to restrict covered services to only those considered to be medically necessary. If a health plan covers mental and addictive disorder services, it must do so using financial requirements and treatment limitations that are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements and treatment limitations applied to substantially all other types of care. In other words, no more insurance policies that require higher copayment rates for mental and addictive disorder care and no more insurance policies that place arbitrary limits on the number of outpatient sessions. Importantly, the law stipulates that if a health plan covers out-of-network care for medical and surgical services, it must also cover out-of-network care for mental health and addictive disorder services. This should increase health plans' coverage of out-of-network therapists, improving consumer choice of provider. For more information on the new parity law, contact Scott Barstow at 800.347.6647 ext. 234 or sbarstow@counseling.org. Rachel M. Milazzo writes: Someone once said that the two constants in life are death and taxes. I would add a third to that list: change. Change is inevitable, and you either move with it or against it. However, the question remains, is it a change for the worse or better? In light of the Mental Health Parity Act passing into law, I am interested in getting readers' take on the changes that are about to come. As head of the Provider Relations Department for American Behavioral, my first thought was that this will cause a huge stir not only among the provider community but, additionally, our provider panel. As I learn more and research the parameters involved with this law, I am becoming increasingly excited about this change and the results it will yield. American Behavioral is an employee assistance program and managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) and, as such, I foresee a minimal negative impact to our members, client companies and providers. With full consideration that there are exceptions to every rule, I think this will be a change for the better. Our company has always managed benefits within the limits of medical necessity, and this law just enforces that practice. If this is rolled out accurately and thoughtfully, I think all parties can, and will, be winners. Patients win because this change will ultimately make it easier for them to access benefits without the stigmas that are attached to mental health and substance abuse treatments. Mental illness has a biological basis and should not have ever been treated differently. The providers win because this change will allow them more sessions, within medical necessity guidelines, to work toward solution-oriented goals. The insurance companies/MBHOs win because this change will now allow them to extend these extra benefits to those individuals who are chronically ill and have been the source of exorbitant claims in the past. These extra steps are obviously taken in the patient's interest, to further their wellness, and in the insurance company's interest, to maintain costs by avoiding situations such as excessive hospitalizations or unnecessary emergency room visits. I think we will see an unavoidable shift in the way we treat patients. The counselor will be phenomenally instrumental in the success of this change. I am excited to be a part of it by expanding our provider network to meet these needs, as they will surely come. One could argue that your actions manifest the outcomes of any changing situation, and as an employee of an insurance company, I promise my providers to do my part to ensure that this is a change for the better. w Q: I have always wanted to start a small private practice.

A: Your question brings to mind an old business joke: If you had five frogs on a log and three of them decided to jump, how many frogs would you have left on the log? The common answer is two, but that answer could be incorrect because there still might be five frogs remaining. You see, there is a big difference between deciding to jump and actually jumping. Most successful entrepreneurs not only had a vision but a mentor who encouraged them to jump. As we have learned from helping others take the private practice \"plunge,\" mentors can make a significant difference. Most of us had a mentor or someone we admired who helped us find our way into the counseling profession. Now that you are a professional counselor, find a mentor to help you in starting a limited practice. (For more information about the mentoring relationship, turn to p. 52) Your mentor could certainly be someone in the helping professions, but it absolutely needs to be someone who has taken a risk and been successful. Seek out respected family members, friends, community members and peers whom you admire and ask them for their keys to success. Do not be afraid to ask others to help mentor you in your new endeavor. In reflecting on my experience, I (Norm) often wonder what would have happened if not for the mentoring of two very special people in my life. Without them, the journey would have been different. And for those counseling entrepreneurs out there who have benefited from mentoring, give back by finding a beginning counselor to mentor. w We will be presenting \"Advanced Private Practice Toolbox: Nuts and Bolts Ideas for Increasing Referrals, Working With Managed Care and Other Tools\" at the ACA Annual Conference & Exposition, cosponsored by the North Carolina Counseling Association, on March 20.

Stebnicki, 2008, Springer Publishing Co., 242 pages, $45, ISBN 978- 0-8261-1544-7 Individuals concerned with counselor self-care should examine Mark Stebnicki's new book Empathy Fatigue: Healing the Mind, Body and Spirit of Professional Counselors. For more than three decades, it has been recognized that mental health practitioners are among a group of professionals who share a vulnerability to fatigue and emotional overload, often referred to by such terms as \"burnout\" and \"compassion fatigue.\" With events such as natural disasters and school shootings on the rise, counseling professionals would appear to be at risk as never before of developing symptoms of stress-related disorders. The American Counseling Association's Task Force on Counselor Wellness has officially recog- nized \"secondary traumatic stress\" as a factor leading to counselor impairment. Empathy Fatigue helps to fill a critical need for authoritative and useful re-sources to counter burnout and promote counselor resiliency. Stebnicki's previous writing has tended to focus on rehabilitation counseling. However, this work is clearly intended for a wider audience. While often associated with crisis counseling, empathy fatigue may be experienced by counseling profes-sionals across a broad spectrum of settings and specialties. Thus, Empathy Fatigue is a potentially valuable resource for all coun-selors. This highly readable work offers an extensive variety of strategies drawn from many cultural traditions and intended to build resiliency and reduce the likeli- hood of emotional, physical and spiritual exhaustion. The text delivers insightful presentations of the following: n Part One, a historical and theoretical review of burnout-related constructs and a definition of empathy fatigue from a holistic emotional, physical and spiritual point of view n Part T wo, a supportive rationale for an integrated approach to self-care from traditional and alternative healing perspectives n Part Three, protocols and questions for focused self-appraisal, with an eclectic range of self-care practices Stebnicki developed the concept of empathy fatigue out of his experience as a crisis responder following the Westside Middle School shootings in Jonesboro, Ark. Perhaps for this reason, the text is characterized throughout by a real-world tone. The examples are relevant, the research scholarly and the exercises practical and realistic. Stebnicki's writing style is uncluttered and smooth, mak-ing this an enjoyable reading experience. One of the more interesting features of this book is the author's comfort dealing with diverse healing traditions. Reviews of East Asian and American Indian heal-ing philosophies are presented along with contemporary Western developments in neuroscience. Many readers will appreci- ate the clear instructions for how to prac-tice different types of meditation. Empathy Fatigue should enjoy wide use- fulness among counseling professionals. Practitioners will find the book valuable as a guide to establish and maintain a personal self-care and resiliency-building program. Clinical supervisors will benefit from the step-by-step recommendations for assessing and supporting overstressed supervisees. Educators might find Empa- thy Fatigue an excellent choice as a text for professional issues courses dealing with the emerging challenges of counselor self-care. Each chapter could serve as the basis for rich classroom discussions and skill-building exercises. I most strongly recommend this book for counselors who practice in settings that provide few re- sources for support.

Gutheil & Archie Brodsky, 2008, The Guilford Press, 340 pages, $38, ISBN 978-1-59385-691-5 In their definitive work on boundary violations, Thomas Gutheil and Archie Brodsky identify a vast spectrum of problems therapists now face. In text- book style, Prevent- ing Boundary Violations in Clinical Practice offers spe-cific scenarios in which clinicians are faced with ethical decisions. Of particular interest is the chapter \"Understand- ings and Misunderstandings,\" which centers on boundary misunderstandings throughout the past two decades. Early on, boundary violations centered on sexual relations between clients and ther-apists, but that term has been expanded to \"sexual misconduct,\" and added to it are violations surrounding self-disclosure, out-of-office contacts, physical contact, gift exchanges, telephone calls and e-mail contact. With attention to detail, the book also focuses on boundary implica- tions surrounding clinicians' personal attire and how office dimensions can in-fluence the therapeutic relationship. Gutheil and Brodsky raise readers' awareness regarding not crossing the fine line between professionally connecting with clients and personally identifying with clients. The authors remind us, \"To facilitate growth, the therapist must be able to let go.\" In Chapter 3, we learn that boundary violations are most likely to start in the January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 21By Ruth Harper Here's a sampling of other books that have crossed our desks recently. Although we didn't have time to give them full reviews, we thought counseling profes-sionals might find them interesting none- theless. Your Perfect Right: Assertiveness and Equality in Your Life and Relationships, Ninth Edition By Robert Alberti & Michael Emmons, 2008, Impact Publishers, 299 pages, $17.95, ISBN 978-1-886230-85-9 One might think that in today's entitled society, a new edition of Your Perfect Right is the last thing we need. However, as I see students continue to struggle with the differences between appropriately stand- ing up for themselves and \"being mean\" (to actually quote a recent student com-ment), I'm reminded that this resource never outgrows its market. Much of the content of this book will be familiar to those who read earlier ver- sions. The new edition contains updated information that deals with assertive, ap- propriate behavior via electronic media, including social networks. Cognitive-behavioral techniques are also highlight-ed, with clear instructions on thought stopping and positive self-statements to increase assertiveness. Management of stress and anxiety is discussed as well. Other new content relates assertiveness to research on the brain, facial expression and social intelligence. Equity and fair-ness remain themes of this work. Coun- selors in almost every professional setting will think immediately of clients and students who might benefit from Your Perfect Right. The Road to Unity in Psychoanalytic Theory By Leo Rangell, 2007, Jason Aronson, 132 pages, $39.95, ISBN 978-0-7657-0512-9 Widely published psychoanalytic scholar Leo Rangell tackles the dilemma of factionalism among thinkers that led, he believes, to the marginalization of psy- choanalytic thought in recent times. As much an intellectual history as an impas- sioned call for a more inclusive, integra-tive approach, this book is for those who value the psychoanalytic perspective and hope for the emergence of a \"unitary\" theory. While recognizing the effects of external factors such as the advent of psy- chopharmacology and a preference (and often economic need) for what he calls \"the quick fix,\" Rangell also points to loss of coherence within the theory itself as problematic. This volume points proudly to the impact and tradition of psycho- analysis while urging forward movement within the field that is open to greater consensus. Leaving It at the Office: A Guide to Psychotherapist Self-Care By John C. Norcross & James D. Guy Jr., 2007, The Guilford Press, 238 pages, $45 (hardcover), $25 (paperback), ISBN 978-1-59385-576-5 The new year seems an ideal time to offer this book as encouragement to counselors to help them remember to take good care of themselves so they can most effectively care for others. Thera- pists' efforts to maintain their own physi-cal, spiritual and mental health often lose out to the immediate needs and concerns of clients. John Norcross and James Guy offer far more than a pep talk on this pe- rennial topic \u2014 they build an irresistible case for caring for oneself as a person and go on to describe self-care techniques that are useful, fairly easy to implement and attractive. Sound research backs up their suggestions, and anyone who reads this book will be motivated to act. Far more practical than preachy, Leav- ing It at the Office is a guide to rejuvena- tion and reward. Counselors practicing in virtually any venue, including and perhaps especially counselors-in-training, will appreciate the emphasis on self- monitoring and commitment to activities that renew and restore therapeutic energy and ability. As this book indicates, healthy living is a lifelong effort \u2014 at times, even a struggle \u2014 for mental health profes-sionals. This invaluable resource includes both deep wisdom and quick tips for bet-ter self-care and places the issue squarely in the milieu of ethical practice. More Than Miracles: The State of the Art of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy By Steve de Shazer & Yvonne Dolan, with Harry Korman, Terry Trepper, Eric McCol-lum & Insoo Kim Berg, 2007, Press, $36 (hardcover), $23 (paperback), 176 pages, ISBN 978-0-7890-3398-7 Since the publication of this book, both Steve de Shazer (to whom the volume is dedicated) and Insoo Kim Berg have died. Their contributions to the establishment and development of solution-focused brief therapy offer an inspiring and lasting legacy to the field of counseling \u2014 a lega-cy from which therapists will continue to draw insight for many years to come. In the tradition of other solution-fo- cused resources, More Than Miracles of-fers a brief overview of the evolution and basic tenets of the approach; it then goes into verbatim illustrations of counseling sessions that demonstrate effective use of the techniques. A final chapter on \"Ques-tions, Misconceptions and Joys\" addresses common misunderstandings regarding solution-focused therapy, such as that it ignores people's problems, avoids dealing with emotions and assumes that clients know what to do. The themes of \"elicit-ing a rich description of the client's solu-tion rather than ... increasingly detailed descriptions of the problem\" and getting to \"a behavioral indicator of a change in the inner state\" provide the founda-tion for the application of strategies that are demonstrated here. This collection of transcriptions shows rather than tells readers how solution-focused therapy op-erates in session. As the authors conclude, \"Our job (as therapists) is to create the conditions under which clients find their own solu-tions, to help clients look into their hearts to find what they truly want and how they might get there.\" u22 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 Ruth Harper is the column editor for Resource Reviews and a professor of counseling and human resource development at South Dakota State University. Submit reviews for consideration to Ruth.Harper@sdstate.edu. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgthree areas of role, time and place. By learning to stay in the therapeutic role and setting secure boundaries around time and place, we are more likely to avoid boundary dilemmas. Readers are guided through vulnerabili- ties associated with both clients and ther- apists, such as the boundary confusion often experienced by those with border- line personality disorder and the distance issues that can cause traumatized patients to push against boundaries. We are also reminded of the difficulty incest victims experience when trying to separate sexual-ity from therapeutic caring. The text makes it clear that the primary emphasis of this, and any, boundary vio-lation study must be to cause no harm to clients. In addition, the book offers a thorough emphasis on the subject of li- abilities and defenses against false accusa- tions, because malpractice suits against mental health professionals stem largely from boundary violation charges. The au-thors state that \"this book is informed ... by the fundamental principle that bound-ary issues are clinical issues first, ethical issues second and legal issues third.\" Gutheil and Brodsky draw from more than 600 professional references for Pre - venting Boundary Violations in Clinical Practice. They summarize the text as a \"supervisor on a bookshelf\" and, indeed, it is one book that any clinician would be advised to study and any supervisor wise to consult.Reviewed by Kim Walen, a private practice therapist in Portland, Ore. u \"This informative and all- inclusive text underscores the complex and comprehensive nature of counseling multiple heritage individuals, couples, and families.

Gladding Most of us find it difficult to dedicate time to reflecting on the events and influences that have helped us become who we are. Samuel Gladding's Becom-ing a Counselor: The Light, the Bright and the Serious includes a broad range of sto-ries that illustrate some of the influences that have helped shape him as a counsel-ing professional. At the same time, the book offers other counselors the op-portunity to gain insights into the types of universal experiences and encounters that have influenced their own lives and directed the help they provide to their clients. Becoming a Counselor is not an autobi- ography, although it certainly draws on many of Gladding's personal experiences. Rather, this book provides counseling professionals with material that can help them examine the turning points in their lives and effectively evaluate how those experiences continue to affect their work and the results they achieve. It's a text that allows counselors to better under-stand how their successes and failures, their family, friends and colleagues and their interactions with clients help them to move forward in their continuing de-velopment as professionals. Gladding is the chair of and a profes- sor in the Department of Counseling at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. He is a Licensed Professional Counselor, a National Certified Coun-selor, a Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselor and a member of the North Carolina Board of Licensed Professional Counselors. He has more than 35 years of counseling experience in public and private agencies, has authored more than 100 professional publications and is a former editor of the Journal for Specialists in Group Work and the Association for Specialists in Group Work newsletter. In addition, Gladding is a former president of the American Counseling Association, the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision, ASGW and Chi Sigma Iota. Counseling Today: Who is the primary audience for this book? Samuel Gladding: I hope it has value for both experienced counselors and counseling students. It is a series of vignettes that covers a lifetime but focuses on 35 years of development as a counselor. As the subtitle indicates, the book contains stories about all aspects of counseling \u2014 the light, the bright and the serious. For individuals just getting into the profession, this book will provide insight. For people already in the field, it will provide prompts for memories they have of their interactions with clients and their own growth as counselors. CT: What inspired this book? SG: I believe our lives are made up of stories that inform us about who we are. These stories also moderate our lives with regard to the good, the bad and the in- between of what it means to be a human being. Over the years, I have accumulated many examples of what counseling is. I realize that while many of my memories are unique, the types of experiences I have had and the lessons learned from them are universal. Surprisingly, in the process of compiling this picture of the many di- mensions of the profession, I found there was really nothing quite like this type of book in the world of counseling. CT: What benefits might this book of- fer to the average counselor or counseling student? SG: In my youth, I was fortunate enough to have John Claypool as one of the ministers in the church I attended. He always used to say, \"People learn from their mistakes. Wise people learn from the mistakes of others.\" I think this is true in counseling as well as in other realms of life. Some of the stories in this book \u2014 in fact, an entire section of 15 vignettes \u2014 contain examples of where I made mistakes and learned from failure. I would hope the average counselor or counseling student would benefit from reading this book and realize that they do not have to be perfect as a professional. We all have feet of clay. We are always becoming. CT: Was this book more difficult to write because so many of the vignettes are personal? SG: I have been amazed that as person- al as counseling is, there are relatively few professional counselors on the national level who are willing to share the personal side of their lives with others. Usually when I read about other counselors' lives, I am reading about their successes. That is fine, except most of us struggle before we thrive. It's important, I believe, that we let others know how we have overcome barriers and setbacks. Thus, some of the material in this book is personal, but per- sonal with a purpose. It is meant to show that life is uneven, unfair and sometimes unpredictable and absurd, yet ultimately life is meaningful, purposeful, at its best relational and at times a lot of fun! CT: Are there one or two primary les- sons or insights that you want readers to derive from this book? SG: I would like for readers to know that sometimes they can be prepared and yet not successful. I also want them to know how important it is to partici- pate actively in continuous learning and preparation because the better you are equipped to handle situations, the bet- ter you will be as a counselor. Finally, I want readers to realize that although we are in a stressful, often toxic and serious profession, there is humor and joy in life. We need to be able to laugh at ourselves as well as empower our clients and help them grow. Interviews with the authors of books for counseling professionals Behind the BOOK - By John Lough January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 25 John Lough is a communications consultant for ACA. Contact him at behindthebook@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgCT: At the end of each of the 14 sec- tions there are \"Points to Ponder.\" What purpose do you see them fulfilling? SG: \"Points to Ponder\" are the process parts of each section. They are the ques-tions that help readers see beyond the dialogue and content of the stories. They are the queries that personalize the narra-tives. Without the \"Points,\" people might be entertained, but there would be no enlightenment. CT: Why do you feel the average coun- selor will be able to relate to your stories and experiences? SG: While a few of the stories are unique and perhaps difficult to relate to on a surface level, on a deeper level most people can recount when they have had thoughts, behaviors or emotions that are a part of or similar to the ones portrayed in these narratives. Counseling is always changing, but human nature remains somewhat consistent. That's why we can still relate so well to Shakespeare's plays. Thus, what is foreign is also common. So it is with some of these vignettes. CT: Do you feel there is material in this book that has the potential to change a counselor? SG: Change is a matter of choice, tim- ing and synchronicity. I believe almost any story has the potential to spark a dif-ference in a person's life. Some of these tales will speak passionately to specific counselors, while some will be read and disappear from consciousness. I suggest reading this book out loud. Hearing words is important. When voiced, words are more powerful and influential than when they are linear. Their potency has a chance to take hold of a person's life and transform it. w Becoming a Counselor: The Light, the Bright and the Serious, Second Edition (Order #72886), can be ordered directly through the ACA online bookstore at counseling.org/Publications or by calling the ACA order line at 800.422.2648 ext. 222.

The course had exposed students to a variety of instructional technologies throughout, and they desired to learn more about how to develop and use them. \"But Dr. Jencius,\" one student lamented, \"I am technologically delayed.\" Despite working in a variety of counseling practices and having had a successful career as a counseling practitioner, this student said she felt her technology skills were behind the curve. Her self-assessment might have been a little harsh. After all, she had shown an ability to complete all the course assignments that I had requested be turned in electronically and formatted in a particular way. Still, her observation caused me to reflect. In working with counseling students and colleagues, I have found that the simple things often leave us feeling behind the curve when it comes to using technology in our teaching and practice. Many of us would like to know how to use little tech enhancements \u2014 things such as changing formats in a document, inserting pictures into a document, shading the cells in a table or spreadsheet, or embedding video into a PowerPoint \u2014 to benefit our teaching or counseling practice. If you see someone using technology in a way that you would like to copy in your own teaching or practice, make the digital New Year's resolution to learn something new. Fortunately, the Internet is full of free resources you can use to learn how to do a variety of things with your productivity software. First, assess your comfort level with computers. Counselors have varying levels of comfort when working with technology. A few of us are just plain Luddites \u2014 the name given to anti-machinery rebels during the Industrial Revolution. In modern usage, the term refers to individuals who oppose advancing technology because of the cultural and socioeconomic changes that they fear will follow. Other counselors simply have moderate anxiety about using technology and may fit the description of a \"technophobe.\" n Dealing with Technophobes \u2014 avtechnologyonline.com/content. aspx?id=301 n How to Teach Technology to Technophobes \u2014 hrworld.com/ features/teaching-technophobes-022108/ n Dealing With Technophobia Among Learners \u2014 articlesbase.com/e-learning-articles/dealing-with-technophobia-among-learners-107071.html Perhaps you've left your technophobia behind and want to begin moving down the path of technological literacy in your practice or teaching.

Pick the one tool or technology you would like to learn and focus on that one technology. Avoid trying to \"learn everything about everything\" all at once. If you want to learn more about presentation software such as PowerPoint, then stick with PowerPoint and try not to complicate things by learning other programs at the same time. Pick a technology or tool with an outcome in mind. If you have an idea of what you want to do with this skill (for example, developing a product for your counseling practice, school or agency), your learning can be driven by this motivation. Perhaps you have an idea for your website or a presentation that will orient clients to your practice or students to your program. Having a vision of the final product keeps the practicality of the learning at the forefront. Find someone you can partner with in your learning. This gives you someone to bounce ideas off of, plus you can test each other's knowledge and skills while learning. Once you learn it and use it, find a way to share it. Nothing reinforces the learning of new technology like showing off your work. Your work may be on direct display for others in your practice or at a professional conference, or you may indirectly demonstrate your skills by teaching another colleague what you have learned. w Do you have a digital New Year's resolution?

While certain names and therapy mod- els did pop up repeatedly, readers might be surprised by some of their colleagues' \"biggest influences.\" If nothing else, the answers once again illustrate just how diverse the counseling profession remains as 2009 begins. Warren Corson III I'm known as \"Doc Warren\" to most. I work at Community Counseling of Central Connecticut Inc., a not-for-profit that I designed and founded. I am the clinical and executive director as well as a full-time therapist. Counseling theory or model While I am an eclectic therapist, the work of Dr. Albert Ellis and his rational emotive behavior therapy have been very influential in my career. I appreciate the straightforward approach of REBT and the ability to translate its model to clients of varying degrees of education, backgrounds and belief systems. My goal is to help clients find the answers for themselves and to do it in such a way that it is easily applicable to future issues and problems. The best day and the best compliment a therapist can get is when a client looks you right in the eye, shakes your hand and tells you that they do not need you anymore. Past counselor or other helping professional The top influences, in no particular or- der, would be Drs. Albert Ellis and Viktor Frankl \u2014 his Man's Search for Meaning should be assigned reading for all psy- chology students. Carl Rogers has been a profound influence in the way I work and live. Marianne Corey and Gerald Corey have provided a great breadth of educa-tion through their textbooks. Patch Ad- ams, M.D., has influenced me to rethink clinical practice and its normal confines. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional My former mentor and current col- league Dr. Nicholas Young has most in- fluenced my work. His influence started during our first meeting in graduate school. He asked me what I wanted to do and then helped me map out the best way to do it. I walked into his office as a 38-credit graduate student and walked out a 60-credit student who would also add two postgraduate programs and then a Ph.D. program to my \"to do list.\" I now have a wall full of degrees and credentials, but most important, I am able to meet the needs of most populations. I also was prepared to open my own agency, which I designed and direct.January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 29 Person outside the profession JFK and MLK taught me that it was OK to dream and that it was my respon- sibility to my brothers and sisters with whom I share the world to make a differ-ence. They taught me about sacrifice and about overcoming obstacles and fighting hate and disparities in a peaceful man- ner. Growing up poor and going without basic necessities could have left me bitter, but my mother taught me to be thank- ful for what little I had because others were not as fortunate. She inspired me to become the first in my family to gradu-ate from high school and supported my dream of attending college. She taught me to ignore the doubters and to live my dream of becoming a doctor. The death of my sister Wendy at age 35 to \"nonlife- threatening illnesses\" inspired me to found Community Counseling of Central Connecticut so that I could help ensure that everyone, regardless of his or her ability to pay, has access to high-quality care from a qualified doctor. Personal experience or historic event All my life, people have come to me seeking guidance. I really do not know why. I have done many things outside the field (I am a certified welder, have done home repair, been a janitor, etc.), but in every endeavor, people came to me seek- ing guidance. My last job outside the field was in a factory. My boss approached me one day and advised me that I was in hot water because so many people were gath- ering around my bench seeking guidance. He advised me that I was not a \"shrink\" and was not hired to help coworkers; I was hired to be a factory worker. I told him he was right, that I had never offered my services to them and did not know why they were coming. I also told him that I quit. I started taking classes the next semester. I realized the responsibili-ties that were being thrust upon me and my duty to do no harm. w Kacee O'Connor Currently, I am in a partnership that is a general counseling practice. We both use sand tray therapy a lot. I use some play therapy, mostly child-centered, although my partner takes most of the younger children. I work with families, couples and many teens. We are in rural Idaho, so we have to be flexible and in-novative because of the shortage of prac-titioners, access to mental health benefits and general resources. Counseling theory or model Rogers' client-centered therapy, Frankl's logotherapy, Landreth's child-centered play therapy, occasional cognitive behav-ior therapy Past counselor or other helping professional Adler, Erikson, Rogers, Frankl, Glasser Contemporary counselor or other helping professional John Gottman, Eliana Gill, Janine Shelby, Gary Landreth, Janine Shapiro Personal experience or historic event I previously taught grades seven through nine, a difficult time for most kids. I felt school counselor training would be helpful and that I might have more opportunity to influence kids as a counselor than as a teacher because I could work with teachers and parents too \u2014 a systems approach. wStephanie Taylor I am a Licensed Professional Counselor residing in Starkville, Miss., and working for Community Counseling Services. My title is children's services coordinator. Counseling theory or model The person-centered model has most influenced my work.Past counselor or other helping professional Carl Rogers, the founder of person- centered therapy, is the counselor of the past who has most influenced my work. Person outside the profession Charles Cooper, my academic adviser while in community college, most influ- enced my decision to become a counselor. He took the time to listen to what I wanted to do with my life, then set me on the right track. w Charles F. Wheeler III Graduate student, Florida State University, rehabilitation counseling Counseling theory or model Cognitive and cognitive behavior therapy, because they are positive both in brief and long-term session time frames and allow merging with other possible resources from other theories. Personal experience or historic event I had traumatic brain injury in 2004, so I have been through many states of re- habilitation. Speech therapists have given me the most direct assistance and ac-commodations. They were the only ones who sought out my goals and beliefs and helped me to try to meet my goals. I have seen the lack of counseling in hospitals and rehabilitation and would like to pro-30 | Counseling T oday | January 2009vide counseling to others with injury or illness. I would like to assist individuals who have illnesses or injuries to progress and meet their goals. I also would like to assist others who have brain injury. w Connie Elkins Executive director for Mountain Kids Inc., a nonprofit organization that sup- ports children in Southwest Virginia with mentoring, academic enrichment and health care programs Counseling theory or model Solution-focused therapies have proved most beneficial when working in school counseling. Past counselor or other helping professional Carl Rogers. His core conditions help me to maintain professionalism and per- spective. I especially appreciate his trust in clients to find their own solutions. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Dr. Alan Forrest (Radford University). He provides quality instruction and lead-ership and is the consummate counselor. Personal experience or historic event I have always been interested in prin- ciples of psychology and motivation. The counseling profession allows me to pursue my interests, which include developing programs that support underprivileged children. w Rev. Janet M. Harman LPC, licensed social worker and or- dained deacon. I live in Charleston, W.Va., and am employed as the deacon associate at St. Marks United Methodist Church. Here, not only am I the as- sociate minister (doing church work \u2014 preaching, teaching, weddings, funerals, visitation), but I have a small counseling practice in which I see about two to three persons weekly. Counseling theory or model Rational emotive therapy and rational behavioral therapy. These seem to be tai- lored for me. I find that my counseling all these years has really been quite cognitive. I encourage my clients to reexamine their thinking patterns, and I teach skills to de-velop new ways of thinking. I encourage lots of reading outside the therapy session because I believe more gets done outside of session. We can practice it in session and \"act,\" but the real work is outside in the world. Past counselor or other helping professional Dr. Robert Smith, a professor I had at Marshall University (then the West Vir- ginia College of Graduate Studies) who taught me how to incorporate RBT/RET into my thinking and doing and helped me in my interviewing skills. He taught me the \"A-B-C\" model. I used this a lot with the clientele I was working with at that time \u2014 men and women who were on parole or probation and seeking em-ployment in their communities. Second, Dr. Linda Geronilla, also then at (Marshall) and now in private practice, was my very first professor in graduate school. From her class I learned so much about group dynamics, about being a counselor, about myself. I probably have never thanked her for her assistance in my growth. She was quite influential for me. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Dr. Albert Ellis (founder of RET) and Dr. Maxie Maultsby (founder of RBT) Person outside the profession Dr. Donald C. Houts, a United Meth- odist clergy member. When I knew him, he was a professor of pastoral care and counseling at St. Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Mo. Through his sharing of pastoral counseling books, personal case notes and articles about counseling, I was hooked. It seemed the right area for me to pursue, and I was just starting un-dergraduate college at that time. When I was ordained a clergyperson, I sent him a thank-you note to let him know just how much his teaching/persona influenced me. w Kimberly Christopher LPC candidate and therapeutic foster care counselor, Youth & Family Services Inc., Enid, Okla. Biggest influences My decision to become a counselor came on the heels of a diagnosis of a ma- jor mental disorder at the age of 18. I was hospitalized for several months in a psy- chiatric unit. While in this unit, I found I had a natural ability to counsel. I left that experience thinking I would go into psychiatry. I was discouraged by others and changed my major to nursing. Not thinking it was a good fit, I dropped out and later returned to school as a psychol- ogy major. At that point, I was influenced most by a Christian psychologist who helped me to see that my energies and natural motivations were indeed directed toward counseling. I am naturally drawn to Adlerian therapy as a predominant theoretical orientation. I have personally lived out most of the aspects of this theory. A contemporary counselor who has most influenced me is a counseling psycholo- gist who was a professor in my graduate school (master's level) and is currently my clinical supervisor at the agency where I work. He encouraged us to stay with our natural bent and excel in the theoretical persuasion that is closest to our personal philosophies. Today, in the footsteps of my mentors, I am pursuing a Ed.D. in counseling psychology. I can only hope that I will be as effective as I am passionate about my profession. w Deborah Walsh I work as a school counselor at Bid- deford High School in Biddeford, Maine. In this capacity, I do academic, career and personal/social counseling with 300- plus students in grades 9 through 12. I recently began a limited private practice doing individual and small-group career counseling and college planning. Counseling theory or model I am familiar with a broad range of interpretive and therapeutic techniques and believe in an integrated approach to counseling, incorporating the most appropriate approaches from various theories to address the unique needs of my clients. That being said, the primary counseling theory that most influences my work is Carl Rogers' person-centered approach to counseling. I also frequently incorporate solution-focused brief therapy when appropriate. In career counseling, I draw heavily on Super's life span theory of career development as my foundation.January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 31Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Professor Marijane Fall, now retired from the University of Southern Maine, played a major role in shaping who I am as a counselor. She taught me how to be with a student or client and to trust my instincts. She is always genuine, accepting and present, putting one at ease, yet able to get directly to the heart of the matter in a way that is meaningful to the client. I continue to learn from Marijane's quiet, compassionate and skillful manner. Personal experience or historic event I spent 20-plus years in some form of management and systems consulting, problem solving with any combination of people, processes and technologies in business settings. It was a rewarding career in many ways. The parts that I liked best, and that most contributed to my success, were building relationships and problem solving. At the same time, I raised a son with learning disabilities who was also exceptionally bright \u2014 a challenging combination for both of us. These experiences, and my work as a Boy Scout leader, resulted in my desire to become a guidance counselor when I retired. \"Retirement\" came early in the form of a layoff in the aftermath of September 11. My \"retirement\" goal was looking bright- er, even though I was only 44 years old. w Joanna Refvem LPC, Mount Airy, N.C., Choices Counseling & Resource Center. My first seven years, I was a school counselor at middle and high school levels, and I still hold an active license. Since 2006, I have owned and operated a private practice. My primary focus is mental health for adolescents, adults, couples and families. Counseling theory or model Reality therapy and choice theory by William Glasser. He utilizes a nonmedi- cal approach with clients, focusing on the ways we seek to have successful relation- ships with others, the unsuccessful solu- tions we employ (particularly attempting to control others through criticizing, blaming, complaining, nagging, threaten- ing, punishing or bribing) and habits we can adopt to live healthy lives (support- ing, encouraging, listening, accepting, www.ncu.edu/counselingtoday 866-776-0331Convenient.

This approach has proved to be powerful in sessions with individuals and couples. In particular, focusing on the fact that we can only control our own behavior has brought about visible changes in the lives of those I treat. Past counselor or other helping professional From the beginning, my own school counselor from years ago challenged me to think beyond my borders and seek more than I had dreamed was possible. Without her, I may have chosen not to attend university. All these years later, I am still grateful, and I hope during my tenure as a school counselor that I proved helpful to others. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional My friend and mentor for years has been Vicki Carr (an LPC in Winston-Salem, N.C.). We trained together. She has always been in private practice and has mentored me through these two and a half years of my own private practice. Kaye McCormick (an LPC and school counselor, Mount Airy City Schools) was my first supervisor out of grad school. She helped me attain my LPC and settled me into school counseling. T ricia Ridge-way (a private practitioner in Mount Airy) has offered me valuable insights into effective practice with practical tools and guidelines. Person outside the profession My relationship with Jesus Christ has formed my worldview, and I truly believe He has navigated me to this place in my life. Through His power, I am able to be present with my clients \u2014 never judg-ing but ever ready to share the hope that is within me. I do not have a Christian practice per se, but I am a Christian who is in the practice of counseling. Personal experience or historic event As my fifth child entered school, I contemplated returning to school to get a teaching credential. With guidance from my local university, I decided my social work undergrad degree would work well with a master's degree in counsel-ing, which I could then use in the school system. w David Capuzzi '' All school counselors, regardless of their level of knowledge of youth suicide and prevention strategies, will gain helpful information that they can use in their setting from this infor-mative and engaging book.\" \u2014Lynn Linde, EdD Loyola College in Maryland ACA President 2009-2010 In this book, David Capuzzi, a renowned expert on suicide, encourages suicide prevention in schools through the use of a clear and eective crisis management plan designed to identify and serve at-risk youth.

I am a past president of ACA and the National Ca- reer Development Association as well as a past chair of the ACA Foundation. Counseling theory or model Nancy Schlossberg's transition theory. I have experienced so many transitions in my personal life and with clients that this theory resonates with me. I have also been fortunate to write with and work with Dr. Schlossberg, so the theory has special meaning. If I get to pick two theories, I would choose Don Super's career development theories, especially as modified by Mark Savickas and others to include adaptability. Past counselor or other helping professional See above. Also John Krumboltz and H.B. Gelatt with their theories relating to happenstance and uncertainty. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional I would also add Elly Waters, role model extraordinaire! Personal experience or historic event I had a commitment to social justice that led me into education as a field. I was led into counseling by teaching elementary school and realizing that was not how I wanted to relate to kids, as well as my first job doing college placement, which I adored. wColette Dollarhide Past president of the Counseling As- sociation for Humanistic Education and Development. I am a visiting assistant professor in counselor education at The Ohio State University, where I specialize in school counseling. Counseling theory or model Humanistic approaches, primarily Adlerian and existentialism. I also believe that creativity and spirituality inform the foundation of how I connect with clients and with my students. Past counselor or other helping professional That past counselor was Adler. His work was the first to address phenom-enology, influence of the family and the affect/behavior/cognition connection that is the basis of all contemporary theories. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional The works of Sam Gladding on creativ- ity and of Myers and Sweeney on wellness and spirituality have a profound effect on the relationships I form with students. Person outside the profession As I was searching for the right \"fit\" relative to my values and how I wanted to be as a professional working in a postsec-ondary or university setting, I took a class in administration of education. The pro-fessor said I reminded him of a counselor educator he knew, and he suggested that I contact Dr. Mary Maples of the Univer-sity of Nevada, Reno (now retired). The rest, as they say, is history. Personal experience or historic event As an educator and administrator for a private college, I was working individu- ally with many second-career adults who were struggling with career transitions. I realized it was impossible to teach them until they were ready to learn \u2014 until their mourning for their lost profession was resolved. So the connection with counseling emerged as I discovered that I needed skills to help them on a personal level before I could help them as a teacher/instructor. As a result, my initial counseling emphasis was career counsel- ing and college student development. After getting into the profession, my in- terests expanded into school counseling. w Cirecie West-Olatunji Immediate past president, Association for Multicultural Counseling and Devel-opment, and assistant professor, Univer-sity of Florida. I conduct research focus- ing on systemic oppression and traumatic stress and the impact those variables have on the academic achievement of cultur-ally diverse and other socially marginal- ized children. Counseling theory or model Culture-centered counseling theory has most influenced my clinical work, instructional practices and research en- deavors. While it was Paul Pedersen's foundational work that was initially published in the Journal of Counseling & Development, many counseling scholars of culturally diverse backgrounds have also contributed to this area. In particular, African-centered counselor educators and psychologists have presented a spectrum of culture-centered approaches to coun- seling and psychotherapy. Additionally, Michael Garrett has provided our disci- pline with a solid foundation for use of indigenous frameworks and interventions from the Native American traditions. 34 | Counseling T oday | January 2009Past counselor or other helping professional By far, the late Dr. Asa Hilliard has been most influential in shaping my perspective on transformational counsel-ing and liberation ideology in clinical practice. Dr. Hilliard impacted a variety of disciplines and functioned beyond the superficial academic silos that we often impose in the academy. His bril- liant mind and relentless quest for social justice provided counselors and other mental health professionals with forward and critical thinking. His untimely death has left a gaping hole for all behavioral scientists. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional It is perhaps Derald Wing Sue's work that has most influenced my thinking today. His steadfast exploration into racial/cultural identity that reflects his own movement and growth as a person is inspirational. I often marvel at his ability to continue this work despite the resis- tance from colleagues and students who frequently project their own fears and uncertainties onto him. In future decades, we will be able to look back on his work and acknowledge his full contribution to the counseling profession. Personal experience or historic event When I took my first counseling course, I was working as an administrator at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where I encountered very bright and intelligent students who were having difficulties with the course work. That very first course in counseling not only answered my questions about the medical students but really spoke to my soul. The fundamental tenets of counseling match my personal philosophy on life. w Anneliese A. Singh President, Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and T ransgender Issues in Coun-seling, and assistant professor, University of Georgia Counseling theory or model Worell and Remer's (2003) feminist empowerment therapy was the first model where I saw possibility in how counseling might address all the \"isms,\" including the ways they intersect with one another. I had always loved multicultural theory and Asian American psychology, but this model allowed me to acknowledge that there are feminists in every culture in the world. Paulo Freire (Pedagogy of the Op- pressed), Martin-Baro (liberation psychol- ogy), Derrick Bell (critical race theory), Audre Lorde (Black lesbian theory), Vijay Prasad (South Asian theory) and bell hooks (feminist theory) have been instrumental influences as well. I am thankful to Dana Comstock, who contin- ues to teach me about relational-cultural therapy. Past counselor or other helping professional Y. Barry Chung (now at Northeastern University) has been a mentor of mine for the past eight years. His commitment to the highest standards of scholarship, mentorship and integrity as a counselor- scholar-advocate inspires me consistently. I carry his influence \u2014 gentle encourage-ment and empowerment \u2014 in my heart in all my work. When I get \"stuck\" and struggle, I am reminded of the many gifts he shared with me during my training, including permission to be myself, do the work I care about most in the world and never slice off the cultural parts of myself as a queer counselor of color. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Grace Poore, a South Asian activist and comrade, made a documentary called The Children We Sacrifice about child sexual abuse in the South Asian community. I was coleading a support group for South Asian immigrant women who had sur- vived intimate partner violence when I first watched her documentary. Her work reminded me to have courage and never forget that adultism \u2014 the oppression of children \u2014 is a core aspect of all other oppressions. Grace works on internation- al lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues as well, and she reminds me of the community liberation that is pos- sible when we recognize that counseling itself is an empowerment process. Person outside the profession My friends and family would make comments about how I gave good advice and was a good listener \u2014 all counselors-to-be hear that feedback! I would also say that the civil rights leaders of Atlanta really influenced me to be a counselor. I remember listening to John Lewis talk about beloved community and Coretta Scott King say things like, \"Homophobia is as morally wrong as racism.\" They both talked about manifesting our individual skills in the world to make it a better place, and counseling seemed like the best way I could use my skills. Personal experience or historic event When my father died, I had been work- ing as a community organizer in the re- productive justice and HIV/AIDS move- ments for about 10 years. His death made me reconsider how I had been working on issues of privilege and oppression from primarily a group or community model. I knew issues such as racism and heterosex- ism hurt people's individual well-being as well, and counseling seemed like the best way to learn how to address these wounds. w Bob Chope President, National Employment Counseling Association, and professor and former chair of the Department of Counseling at San Francisco State Uni- versity. I am a semiretired professor and continue in my consulting practice at the Career and Personal Development Insti- tute in San Francisco. Counseling theory or model Andres Consoli and I have created our own theory titled contextual integrative psychotherapy, which can be accessed through the American Psychological As- sociation publication on integrative psy-chotherapies. That theory has been guid- ing my work for the past few years. We have shown counselors how to integrate both theory and multicultural under- standing into one framework. It can be compared, to some extent, with Wendy Patton's systems theory framework from Australia. Past counselor or other helping professional My adviser, David P . Campbell, was greatly influential to me. Epson and White, the founders of narrative therapy, and Cochran, who operationalized this material for career counselors, were also very influential.January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 35Contemporary counselor or other helping professional I appreciate the contributions of Mark Savickas to my work and to career and employment counseling in general. Person outside the profession B.F . Skinner was a very positive mentor and role model for me while I was an un- dergraduate at Harvard. Erik Erikson also played a role in my becoming a counselor and psychologist, but Skinner had the most impact. Actually, Skinner wanted me to be more of a researcher than a clinician and told me much later that he was disappointed that I did not follow the track he had suggested. Not enough posi- tive reinforcement? Personal experience or historic event I was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam era, and I worked with de- linquent adolescents for four years as my alternate service. Thereafter, I was hooked on counseling and pursued my Ph.D. at Minnesota after my duty time was completed. wShawn Dunn Junior/senior counselor at Bossier High School, Bossier City, La. Counseling theory or model William Glasser's reality therapy Past counselor or other helping professional Dr. Nichter was one of my professors at Sam Houston State University while I was working on my master's degree in counseling. I can recall several real-life examples she gave us that inspired me. When I am working with students, I try to think, \"What would Dr. Nichter do?\" Personal experience or historic event My parents got divorced when I was in elementary school. I didn't quite \"feel the effects\" until I was in high school because I don't think I let myself. At that point, my high school guidance counselor was there to keep me on track and to help me determine what I wanted for my future. w Elliott Ingersoll President-elect, Association for Spiritual, Ethical and Religious Values in CounselingCounseling theory or model Ken Wilber's integral model, which I use as an organizing framework for my counseling practice. I've worked with Integral Institute for six years developing the integral counseling model, and we did a special issue of Counseling and Values on the model. Past counselor or other helping professional Jan Gill Wigle, who taught at Youngstown State University. She and Chris Faiver were incredibly encouraging and tolerant of my somewhat opposi-tional nature. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Judy Miranti, Ansel Woldt and Chris Faiver. All three have been incredibly generous with their time and wisdom in helping me throughout my journey. Person outside the profession My philosophy professor, Dr. Martin Greenman, also of Youngstown State University. He was chair of philosophy in the 1980s and directed me away from philosophy toward applied psychology and counseling. He thought I would have more fun (and he was right).

Making my own issues objects of awareness has helped me tremendously in working with people and in channeling my energies in resourceful ways. w Brooke B. Collison Professor emeritus, Oregon State Uni- versity, and past president of ACA Counseling theory or model I did most of my graduate work in counseling in the 1960s at the height of the Rogers-Skinner debates. For me, Rogers came out the winner, and there is still a great deal of the philosophical orientation toward people, interaction and change from that era that guides my day-to-day living. As grad students, we had many long and passionate discus-sions about theoretical orientations and techniques. Over the years, the core set of beliefs has remained the same, has prob- ably been reduced in number and remain a constant in my life. Past counselor or other helping professional E. Gordon Collister was a faculty mem- ber in the counseling program at the Uni- versity of Kansas. He had an enormous impact on me in class and in personal interaction. He saw me outside his office one day when I looked rather despon- dent. I had been working with some ado-lescents and felt I was not having any im- pact on their lives. He said, \"Collison, get in here and sit down.\" He asked what was going on. After I voiced my concern that I was not being effective, he asked, \"What makes you think you can 'fix' everything for everybody?\" I left his office after a lengthy discussion with a new perspective on my work \u2014 a perspective that remains with me today. Person outside the profession The major influence on the way I teach, work with others, conduct groups or counsel came from a group of very bright high school students where I began my teaching career. It didn't take me long to discover that they knew more about the subject at hand than I did. Among the group were students who wrote better than I could, spelled better than I could, knew more about state government than I did and had read more than I had. My confidence was shaken to the core, and the thought of going to school and trying to give that group information actually made me ill. In a moment of insight, I realized I didn't have to know more than they did and I didn't have to teach by \"providing information.\" I could help them manage what they knew and find ways to expand beyond their knowledge base. My teaching philosophy changed immediately. It resembles my counseling philosophy. w Graham L. Peveller I run an established worldwide online service that provides an essential facil- ity for the transgender community, in particular those requiring assistance and assessment of gender-related issues and transition. I provide support, counseling and assessment of gender-identity issues, readiness for hormones and, if desired, sex reassignment and/or related surgeries for both trans men and women. Counseling theory or model Overall, I take a Rogerian and generic approach (if one thing fails, try some- thing different) in my work, which, with gender-related issues, is not about therapy (change) but counseling. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional I would have to answer generic social work in the United Kingdom and my then involvement with both individual and family therapy. Person outside the profession John Byng-Hall and David Campbell, Tavistock Institute, London Personal experience or historic event Working with the above people in the early 1970s at the onset of my social work career in the United Kingdom. w Justin Galloway I am the clinical supervisor for the Richmond, Va., office of Youth Villages. I offer clinical guidance to a team of in- home counselors who work with families involved with social services or court services. Counseling theory or model I work from a combination of family systems, solution-focused and multi- systemic therapies. In graduate school, I felt that family systems was a good theory base, but most of my therapy looked more solution-focused. Currently, I work from a systems model on which my em- ployer bases its approach. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Dr. Tom Smith at Auburn University encouraged me to get into family therapy and into the counseling field. He helped guide me in the right direction and into the right area of the field that would best suit my career and life goals. Person outside the profession Randy Tyner is a pharmacist and owns his own pharmacy in Birmingham, Ala. I worked for him through high school and the early part of college. He is a tremen-dous leader and someone I would label as being successful. Randy taught me much of what I know when it comes to leader-ship skills, customer service and meeting your clients at their level. Although he's not in the counseling field, he is in the helping profession, and much of what I learned from him has carried over into my career. Personal experience or historic event Counseling was a calling for me rather than a career choice. It is something I have a natural ability and eagerness for. I could not picture myself doing anything else. w Kia Sanford Kailo Counseling and Nutrition, Ashland, Ore. Counseling theory or model Really, the fact that there are so many foundations from which to work is the biggest influence of all. It has freed me to see that my hybrid style will help the cli- ents with whom I build rapport, and that it really is the rapport that holds the most weight in any counseling relationship more so than any particular framework or model. Past counselor or other helping professional I have learned much from Anne Wilson Schaef's work as well as Charlotte Kasl, Jon Kabat-Zinn, David Sobel and Robert Ornstein. I have incorporated teachings January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 37from Rumi and the Dalai Lama and the quantum viewpoints of Larry Dossey and Deepak Chopra. Most influential by far, however, are my clients themselves. I learn something new from each indi-vidual I see. Personal experience or historic event It finally clicked for me when a friend I was helping through a very difficult and abusive breakup with a significant other turned to me one day and said, \"It's a shame you aren't doing this for a living. You'd be a great counselor.\" It was then that I realized I had essentially been doing lay counseling naturally my whole life. I went back to school to make it official. w Sunny Sundal Hansen Past president of ACA and NCDA; professor emerita, counseling and student personnel psychology, University of Minnesota; founder and director of BORN FREE Program Counseling theory or model Donald Super's developmental stages and life rolesPast counselor or other helping professional Professor Henry Borow and professor emerita Helen Farmer Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Professor Nancy Betz on women's career development Person outside the profession Professor Robert Beck, University of Minnesota, comparative and cross- cultural education Personal experience or historic event Having Dr. Bill Dugan, University of Minnesota, as my adviser w Eric A.

Choose from clinic helping professional Yalom \u2014 existential psychotherapy Person outside the profession My father Personal experience or historic event My chaotic childhood and family of origin inspired me to enter the field of counseling. w Joanne M. Wholey Psychotherapist and LPC. I live and work in Bloomfield, Conn. My practice is focused on adults. I work with indi- viduals experiencing mood disorders and work/life issues. I have particular exper- tise in the areas of trauma recovery, eye movement desensitization and reprocess- ing, and pet loss/bereavement support groups. Counseling theory or model My counseling practice is eclectic and has been most influenced by the human- istic and transpersonal theories.Past counselor or other helping professional Carl Rogers and his unique ability to empathize and be with the client in the moment. On a more personal level, I had the privilege of working with a therapist in my late 30s who walked with me through a terrifying and difficult journey related to some significant childhood trauma. She is the inspiration for my work with trauma clients today. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional I would have to say Richard C. Schwartz, founder of the Center for Self Leadership and the internal family systems model. I am toward the end of the first of three levels of training in this model. Personal experience or historic event For most of my professional career, I was in the field of human resources with a prominent insurance company. It satis-fied some of my desire to help others, but it had its constraints. My passion had always been to relate to people on a more intense and personal level. In the 38 | Counseling T oday | January 2009fall of 1995, my mother suddenly became very ill and died two months later. This experience evoked some serious ques-tions about what was important in life. I wondered if I would have any regrets if I knew my life were ending. After some thoughtful consideration and trepidation, I chose to begin the journey, interviewing for graduate school on my 40th birthday. Although my mother's death was a devas-tating experience, it became the catalyst for my personal and professional growth. This was her last gift to me. w Jesus Roberto Martinez Medical case manager/liaison, Opportunity Center for the Homeless, El Paso, Texas; earned a master's of educa-tion with highest honors in guidance and counseling from the University of Texas at El Paso Counseling theory or model Gestalt therapy and its emphasis on addressing unfinished business from the past in the here and now. Gestalt therapy has allowed me to help clients who were stuck with an array of unfinished business such as unresolved grief, rage, hatred and resentments. I consider gestalt therapy's techniques, such as the empty chair, letter writing, role playing, psychodrama and re-enactments, to be extremely valuable tools and assets to have at my disposal. However, I would not venture directly into gestalt therapy without first engag-ing a client for at least four sessions with person-centered therapy to establish a working, collaborative client-counselor relationship. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional While doing my social work field ex- perience at a private psychiatric facility, I had the good fortune of being supervised by a master's-level social worker who taught me how to facilitate groups. His name is Sam Nunez, and he continues his private practice. Person outside the profession My mother wanted me to become an educator, and in the long run, things have worked out because I believe that as a counselor, I motivate, teach, guide and counsel.Personal experience or historic event When I was honorably discharged from the military in 1972, I had a real tough period of adjustment for about 12 years. After being in therapy for several years with clinicians from the Department of Veterans Affairs, I made a decision to go back to school and earn a degree in counseling. w Samuel T. Gladding Past president of ACA; chair and professor of counseling, Department of Counseling, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, N.C. Counseling theory or model Existential theory is the model that has most influenced my work. I love the emphasis existentialism gives to the importance of discovering meaning and purpose in life. I also like systems theory as a model for examining interpersonal dynamics. Past counselor or other helping professional The work of Rollo May and Viktor Frankl have influenced me the most. I once took a course under Rollo May at the New School in New York City, com- muting in for four weeks when I was a graduate student at Yale. The Frankl influence comes from teaching a sum-mer graduate course in Vienna, Austria, for Wake Forest on the Vienna theorists. Frankl's grandson, Alex Vesely, a logo-therapist in his own right, has helped fa-cilitate this course. Alex has made Frankl come alive for me. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Dick Hackney. I like his modesty and his ability to write and speak in such a way that knowledge and insight is gleaned in an inspirational and sometimes humorous, but always clear way. Mark Young has been equally dynamic and in-fluential in my life and work. Person outside the profession As a teen, I remember being intrigued with Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the second secretary-general of the United Nations. I thought he was an altruistic figure and a deep thinker. In more modern times, I have been influenced by the lives of Mother Teresa, John Claypool and my grandfather, after whom I was named. Personal experience or historic event Initially, I planned to be a minister. However, at Yale Divinity School, I real- ized my passion was more in the counsel-ing than the theological arena. Tom El- more, who began the counseling program at Wake Forest, was instrumental in help- ing me make the change, and my parents supported me unconditionally. w Yahaya Lasiele Alabi Lecturing and counseling, Department of Counsellor Education, University of Ilorin, Nigeria Counseling theory or model Rational emotive behavior therapy Past counselor or other helping professional Albert Ellis Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Professor A.

Peter was one of the creators of the antibullying program that has been used in schools all around the country. I saw how Peter used music to touch people's hearts and minds. As a musician, I was inspired, and I began to use music more both as a counselor and as a counselor educator. Although Peter is not a counselor, he has the sensi-tivity, compassion and understanding that all great counselors have. wJanuary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 39Jane Myers Past president of ACA, the Associa- tion for Adult Development and Aging, and the Association for Assessment in Counseling and Education; professor, University of North Carolina at Greens-boro Department of Counseling and Educational Development. I teach gradu-ate counseling students at the entry and doctoral levels. Counseling theory or model Alfred Adler's individual psychology. It has been more helpful than any other approach in contributing to my under-standing of human behavior and change processes. Past counselor or other helping professional Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, widely known as the \"father\" of multicultural counseling. Dr. Wrenn's personal presence was inspir-ing \u2014 he truly was a \"humanitarian and caring person\" and a \"mensch.\" Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Dr. Tom Sweeney, an Adlerian counsel- or, and Dr. Allen Ivey, whose work in de-velopmental counseling and therapy has influenced my teaching and counseling. Person outside the profession My mother, who taught special educa- tion and had guidance counselor creden- tials. Albert Schweitzer, whose humani-tarian work and reverence for life made him a hero during my childhood and adolescence. Personal experience or historic event Growing up with a brother who had a profound hearing loss and severe developmental disability; having him institutionalized at age 17 through a court order because the neighbors signed a petition asking that he be removed from the neighborhood, as they found him objectionable. w Brian S. Canfield Immediate past president of ACA. I have been a practicing counselor and counselor educator for three decades and currently serve as vice president for academic affairs at Southern Arkansas University. Counseling theory or model My initial influence was the work of Carl Rogers, which continues to be the core of my relationship with clients. Lat- er, this was expanded with a knowledge of structural-strategic family therapy and family of origin theory. More recently, in the past several decades, my approach to counseling has been refined by cybernet- ics and social constructionist theory. Past counselor or other helping professional My eighth-grade school counselor at Midway Middle School in Shreveport, La. \u2014 whose name I unfortunately do not recall \u2014 provided my first exposure to counseling, assisting in my adjustment to a new school. This was a very positive experience that shaped my expectations of counseling as a \"helping\" profession. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Too many to mention by name \u2014 all of the professors, supervisors and col-leagues with whom I have interacted have made their mark on my work. Person outside the profession My parents instilled a strong value of respecting all persons and the importance of helping others \u2014 regardless of the nature of one's work. Personal experience or historic event Recognizing that most aspects of the human condition are universal. My deci- sion to become a counselor was based on a desire to earn a living and help others at the same time. w Jamie Cross-Lee I am an LPC in Georgia. I am a play therapist and continue to work with children/adolescents through my private practice, Patchworks Counseling Center Inc., located in Stone Mountain, Ga., and as an adolescent substance abuse preven-tion specialist with the Department of Juvenile Justice. I also counsel adults, families and couples. Biggest influences I use several different theories whenever I feel they are appropriate for the client. Adlerian for adolescents and cognitive behavioral theory are used most. I had a supervisor named Karen Nash who specialized in treating traumatized children. She was very knowledgeable, patient and had a natural talent for pro- viding families what was needed. I aspired to be like her. Also, my minister, who I call my spiritual father, Bishop Melvin Mosley, has always shown love to every- one, helping them tirelessly. He has done missionary work in Haiti and Africa for 40 years and continues to be dedicated. Bishop Mosley recruited me and other college students to work with the youth at the church. I realized the kids and their families had issues I wasn't prepared to handle, and Bishop Mosley was unable to counsel them all.

I was accepted and started school the next semester. I continued working with the kids and families until I graduated and relocated to Georgia. w Eric J. Green President of Counselors for Social Jus- tice. I am an assistant professor and coor- dinate the play therapy program at Johns Hopkins University. I maintain a part- time private practice in analytical child psychotherapy with elementary school-aged children and their families. Counseling theory or model Jungian psychology has predominantly influenced my clinical practice and the way I view the world. Past counselor or other helping professional Reese House was a significant past counselor who heavily influenced my worldview and the mechanism I use to help children through advocacy. His words of wisdom on ensuring equitable services for every child in school systems are still with me today. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Three strong, independent women/ leaders in the counseling profession: Drs. Theresa Christensen, Vivian McCollum and, especially, Barbara Herlihy. Person outside the profession Rev. Paul Metrejean, a Catholic priest and counselor in south Louisiana, influ- enced my decision to become a counselor. He also is the individual who introduced me to Jung's theory. Personal experience or historic event I have known since I was 17 years old and beginning my undergraduate studies at Louisiana State University that I was meant to be a counselor. Not until I was midway through the master's degree did I realize that I also wanted to help children. Rev. Paul Metrejean is the person who en-couraged me to work with children, and I am forever indebted. wJudy Maris I am in private practice in Bozeman, Mont., working with individual adults. I work with anxiety, depression and psy- chological trauma. I have extensive expe- rience working with survivors of domestic abuse. I enjoy doing depth work, which does not necessarily have to take a long time, when the client is ready. Counseling theory or model Psychodynamic psychotherapy was what made sense to me from the begin- ning of my graduate studies. The rich- ness and complexity with which it views human experience and relationship has formed the core of my work. Even though I work primarily with adults, the model frequently helps make sense of both intrapsychic and relationship patterns. It has also been invaluable in helping me to understand my own at- tachment issues and how they travel with me into the consultation room. Past counselor or other helping professional Unquestionably, the person who has im- pacted my personal life and clinical work to the greatest degree is Dr. John Christo- pher, my supervisor, professor and mentor at Montana State University. Christopher teaches a class called Mind-Body Medi-cine and the Art of Self-Care (see Counsel- ing Today, November 2006.) Through his class, I was introduced to the concept of mindfulness \u2014 awareness of the present moment without judgment. In the class, we were invited to experience both our-selves and the phenomenological world in ways that involved emptying more than filling up; letting go rather than accumu- lating; being rather than doing. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional I struggled to find a theoretical and therapeutic model that would incorporate my passions for psychodynamic theory, attachment theory and mind-body aware- ness. I found that model in Hakomi therapy, developed by Ron Kurtz. Ha-komi postulates that it is not necessary to engage in long, speculative conversations about our past because our psychological histories and core beliefs are visible in the way we arrange our bodies to meet the world. Based on qualities in the therapist that include mindfulness and what Kurtz calls \"loving presence,\" Hakomi provides the means for accessing our deepest, usu- ally unconscious beliefs about ourselves, the nature of the world and what we ex- pect from relationships. Person outside the profession The last major influence I want to mention is not outside the profession. My partner and best friend, Dr. Barton Evans, freely shares his 32 years of train- ing and experience in psychotherapy, assessment and forensic psychology with me. As an unofficial supervisor, he has provided unerring guidance with both challenging clients and challenges aris- ing from my own psychological history. He helps me to think about clients in greater depth and breadth, correcting my sometimes hasty reach for an easy inter-pretation. He is a model of the best our profession has to offer. Personal experience or historic event In my early fifties, I read an interview with Carlos Castaneda in which he said, \"Death is your truest friend and your most reliable adviser. If you have doubts about the course of your life, you have only to consult your death. Death will never lie to you.\" The moment I read those words, I thought, \"I want to be- come a counselor.\" w Sylvester C.K. Lim I reside in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and run my own Wellness Center, pro-viding \"treatment\" (which we refer to as \"consultations\") to individuals, groups and families. We also offer public work- shops to help people understand them- selves better and for self-development and growth. I recently accepted the position of CEO for Pride Foundation, a charity organization that enhances awareness efforts and improves accessibility to treat- ment for breast cancer at all levels of society. Counseling theory or model I remember my professor asking this question when I was in grad school at East Tennessee State University. I said I felt my answer was a cop-out because it seemed like the easy way out to say I was \"eclectic.\" She kindly assured me, \"That's not a cop-out answer,\" and this has stayed with me. I sometimes think I rely a lot on psychodynamic approach, but truly, in practice, I am a mixture of everything. January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 41We really do have to be \"intuitive\" and rely on our inner instincts to guide us. But we also are led by our clients, and our approaches are \"made\" to fit our clients' needs rather than our own unyielding style. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional The two people in the field who most influenced me are the professor I men-tioned above, Dr. Peggy Cantrell, whom I had the utmost respect for, and Rhonda, a supervisor of mine many years later when I joined the working folks out in the \"real world.\" I truly learned a lot from these two women and up until this day, I still hold them in high esteem and talk about the influence they had on me. Personal experience or historic event I remember very clearly one day when I felt I had to choose between computer science (and programming) and the study of psychology. I had gone to the U.S. to study computer science initially, though I always had a fascination for psychology. In my junior year, I was going through one of our computer-generated sheets that listed hundreds of our \"compilation\" errors when it occurred to me that doing computer programming was kind of like dealing with human \"challenges\" in that the presented symptoms may seem to be in the hundreds. But if we could find the one source (or a handful), then the hun- dreds of \"symptoms\" (or error messages in the computer programming sheet) would seemingly disappear. While I enjoyed both, I asked myself which would be more significant. I am where I am today because of that \"turning point.\" wE.T. \"Moe\" Briggs I serve as clinical director for the Kol- mac Clinic in Washington, D.C. I am responsible for the day-to-day operation of an intensive outpatient clinic serving the treatment needs of persons with ad-dictive and co-occurring disorders. Counseling theory or model The centerpiece of my work is cogni- tive behavioral therapy, especially as expressed by Aaron Beck in Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse. Interestingly enough, it fits well with elements of my person-centered practice as expressed by Carl Rogers. Past counselor or other helping professional Lynne, my supervisor, introduced me to the importance of being trained to work with patients with co-occurring disorders. She made the notion of \"do no harm\" critical to my development and my desire to continue my education. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional George, who teaches me to use the sci- ence of our field and our collective expe-rience to improve our service delivery. We must find ways to adapt to changes in our practice to meet the ever-changing needs of our patients. Person outside the profession My mother who, without knowing or planning it, gave a lifetime of service to others, demonstrating care, concern and perseverance when things did not go as she expected. Personal experience or historic event The most significant experiences were attending trainings and seminars to ob- tain certification as an addiction coun-selor. I understood from the experienced counselors that it takes more than a desire to help others get better. I learned that the counseling profession is a special call-ing that requires a good balance between desire, compassion and training. w Cheryl Smith I have a private counseling practice in Charleston, S.C. I accept rotational con- tract assignments to do consultant work counseling at U.S. military installations around the world. Biggest influences The following individuals, experiences and perceptions have exerted relevant influence over my professional development: 1. Parents who supported self-expression in writing and reading activities and validated my self-worth. 2. Psychologists who early on supported my fledgling efforts to \"apprentice\" with them while counseling psycholog- ically and physically wounded veterans in VA hospitals. 3. Valuable family role models who dem- onstrated generosity and humor. 4. Multiple geographic relocations as a young person and learning to develop and maintain friendships. 5. Summer camp counseling, guiding eight to 10 young girls to become a cooperative team while allowing for individual differences. 6. The humility that comes with having children. 7. Divorce, with successful networking and readjustment. ACA members can download complete issues of Counseling Today from the website dating back to 2006.

There but for the grace of God go I. w David Capuzzi Chair, ACA Insurance T rust, and past president of ACA. I reside in Oregon but work for Penn State University. I com- mute periodically to teach intensively formatted counselor education courses and conceptualize and implement Sum- mer Institutes for counselors and other helping professionals. I am a professor emeritus of Portland State University in Oregon. Counseling theory or model I have studied all the mainstream mod- els that are usually taught in counselor education programs as well as a number of Eastern and alternative models. The most important ingredient in a helping relationship is the counselor's ability to create a safe \"holding environment\" for the client. If the counselor has the innate capacity to make the client feel affirmed and safe, a number of models can be ef-fective with many (not all) presenting problems. Past counselor or other helping professional Harold F . Cottingham, a past president of APGA (the American Personnel and Guidance Association, now ACA), was my adviser and mentor during my doc- toral work at Florida State University. I was 23 when I began my doctorate, and he predicted that I would become presi- dent of what is now ACA. I could not understand what he saw in me. He con-tinued to mentor and support me (e.g., he called me twice a year every year until he died) for almost 20 years after I com- pleted my Ph.D by providing support, affirmation and advice. He was certainly a major influence.Contemporary counselor or other helping professional A number of contemporary counselors have influenced my work. A characteristic they all have in common is that their pro- fessional identity is that of a professional counselor and their affiliation is primarily with ACA. They don't need to identify themselves with other professions because they understand the power and impact of the strength-based approach members of our profession use when counseling or consulting with those seeking assistance. Person outside the profession At the time I began my graduate work, there was a great deal of momentum in this country to place the needs of others before our own and to make the \"com-munity\" a kinder, gentler, more affirming place in which people of all creeds, colors and ideologies could reside. A number of national figures symbolized this hope for the future and inspired others to work for the betterment of the less fortunate. My decision to enter the profession of coun-seling was, in many ways, my approach to contributing to this movement. Personal experience or historic event As I grew up, I was surrounded by a number of adult role models who helped me develop a resilient, mostly positive and direct approach to communication and problem solving. I always found joy and excitement in the people and things around me and a myriad of opportuni-ties for developing interests and involve-ments. These characteristics have worked well for me in the process of counseling and mentoring others. w Mary R. Rudberg Rehabilitation counselor, Pennsylvania Office of Vocational Rehabilitation Counseling theory or model As a rehabilitation counselor, I rely on choice theory by assisting clients with choices and options. However, the theory that has influenced me the most is the Rogerian theory. Establishing a relation- ship through rapport building is by far most essential to the counseling process. Past counselor or other helping professional Don Angelone, retired district admin- istrator of the Pennsylvania Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR), has influenced the way I work with clients. It did not matter how busy Don was; if I had a problem and needed his support in the field, he was there. No matter how busy his day was, he took time to really listen. Particularly, he taught me to \"stay in the room\" with clients, to be present and attentive with them. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional My first assignment at OVR was a caseload that consisted of individuals with drug and alcohol (D&A) disabilities. Ron, the counselor who had the caseload before me, was referred to as the \"god of D&A,\" partly because he had developed a D&A program where there had not been one previously. His initiative and drive to pro- vide services for D&A clients in achieving their life goals was impressive. I modeled his initiative and drive in assisting clients. Through Ron, I learned how to encourage clients to be the best they could be. Ron taught me to look at the clients' abilities, not their disabilities. (Incidentally, Ron Rudberg is now my husband.) Person outside the profession My dear friend Donna is one person who has supported me throughout my entire life. Donna was there not only dur-ing the fun times, but also paid witness to some of the darker periods of my life. It was during these darker periods that Donna would say, \"You can do this. With your past experience, this is a cakewalk for you.\" Her support, encouragement and sense of humor truly influenced my decision. When combined with my desire to instill hope in others, it sealed my deci-sion to enter the field of counseling. Personal experience or historic event My mother and father both had dis- abilities. My father had heart disease, secondary to alcoholism, and passed away at age 56. When my mother was 56, she had a stroke, secondary to drug addic- tion. I took care of her in my home. My mother's illness was the catalyst to re- visit my education. I decided to cash my G.E.D. in and take some classes at the local community college. One step led to another, and I earned a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling. Currently, I am a doctoral student at Duquesne Univer-sity, and my plan is to someday teach at a university. The environment in which I January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 43was raised influenced me to strive to bet- ter myself and to help others believe and better themselves. w Fr. Kevin Conroy Maryknoll associate priest, Maryknoll \"Little Sprouts\" project and professor of psychology, Royal University of Phnom Penh, Cambodia Biggest influences I might have a different perspective on the profession of counseling and psychol- ogy because Cambodia has few mental health professionals. One of the \"biggest influences\" in my life as a counselor flows out of the needs of the hundreds of or-phans and other people living with HIV/AIDS we serve in our projects here in Phnom Penh. Another \"biggest influence\" includes the M.A. students in clinical psychology/counseling I am currently teaching at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. This program is the first master's-level training in Cambodia in any of the mental health-related fields. There are so many needs here in Cambo- dia because of the trauma of the Khmer Rouge era and the ongoing poverty. Personal experience or historic event I became interested in the profession of counseling while working in El Salvador from 1989 to 1995. During those years, I saw the effects of trauma caused by the civil war. The impact of the trauma on the poor villagers and communities we worked with in the countryside was profound. During those years, I also saw people with tremendous resilience. I wanted to learn more about how counsel-ing could help the poor of El Salvador deal with the trauma of war. Another experience that has influenced my decision to enter the counseling profession is my many years of pastoral counseling as a Catholic priest. Whether serving in the inner city of Lorain, Ohio, or the countryside of El Salvador, people want to be able to share their joys, hopes and sorrows in a confidential and caring manner. The counseling field has given me additional resources that help me lis- ten to the needs of the people. Person outside the profession During my years in El Salvador, I became acquainted with the work of Martin-Baro, a Jesuit social psychologist. He was murdered in 1989 with five other Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daugh-ter. His \"psycologia de la liberacion\" and research into the effects of political vio- lence and torture on poor communities are important areas that can be used in the formation of counselors and psychol- ogists throughout the developing world. I felt that the skills of counseling could assist my pastoral response to people liv- ing in poverty. Martin-Baro's work was an important reference for my dissertation and informs my current desire to help people in Cam-bodia. While my work with our Little Sprouts (270 children who are orphaned and HIV positive) has precluded more extensive work with the traumatized communities of Cambodia, I am trying to be a \"bridge\" for Western counseling in this country. My work with Cam- bodian children who are orphaned and living with HIV/AIDS requires that we implement basic counseling skills on a regular basis. w Mariah Emond Child and family therapist, The Center for Mental Health, Delta, Colo. We pro- vide functional family therapy, juvenile justice program work, individual therapy and behavioral interventions. Counseling theory or model Functional family therapy, an approach to high-risk families that doesn't blame or shame, but rather offers insight into the reasons why we do \"bad things\" and what families can do differently. It builds hope and skills. Past counselor or other helping professional Marsha Linehan and her dialectical behavioral theory. It's like a toolbox every person can utilize to enhance their rela- tionships, build better boundaries and be aware of their unique selves. I use her tools often with clients who are struggling and wanting to know what to do better for themselves. Personal experience or historic event T wo events have been influential. In college, I had an episode of major de- pressive disorder. I remember thinking, \"I'm healthy and adjusted. Why is this happening to me?\" That question led me to seek out why mental health issues happen and how I could take better care of myself so that others wouldn't have to go through the same experience without support. Now I have a greater empathy for clients experiencing depressive symp- toms and who have a connection to my own mental health issue. Second, I was working in the challenge course industry with a high-ropes course at a children's psychiatric hospital when I realized I didn't have the skills to work with the emotional side of teambuilding and self-actualization. I wanted to be able to talk with people about their reaction to high-ropes climbing (30 feet in the air on a secure belay) \u2014 especially their fear! I went back to school for my master's in counseling shortly thereafter. w Jim Bierma I am currently the American School Counselor Association president and previously was the middle school level vice president. In real life, I provide dis-trictwide school counseling supervision for Minneapolis Public Schools, and I am a school counselor at Phoenix Alternative High School in Minneapolis. Counseling theory or model The ASCA National Model has trans- formed our school counseling team's comprehensive program. The ASCA National Model helps our team identify what main things we need to work on, develop a plan to accomplish our goals and evaluate our interventions. I use humanistic underpinnings with solution-focused techniques. It is important for me to give my students unconditional positive regard and empathy. I try to be genuine with my students and give them realistic hope. Past counselor or other helping professional Irvin Yalom's work made me more ef- fective in group settings. I use his tech- niques every day. His ideas on how to use process helped my group members be more successful. He is one of my favorite authors; his books give me insight on how I can help my students with their personal/social issues. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Norm Gysbers has had a huge impact on how I set up a comprehensive school 44 | Counseling T oday | January 2009counseling program. He emphasizes that an effective school counseling program should address the academic, career and personal/social domains. His work had profound influence on the ASCA National Model development. Carolyn Stone has also influenced me a lot. She helped me understand how to implement ethical standards into my daily work and is my main mentor on how to be an effective leader. T rish Hatch and Judy Bowers also have influenced how I set up a comprehensive school counseling program. Person outside the profession I am a Gandhi nut. I have read every book he wrote and every book about him that I could find. He has so many admi- rable qualities. He always tried to work with people he had differences with and worked hard to make things better for his people. I also really like Mother Teresa. She is such a great role model on how to pro-vide service for others. She dedicated her life to assisting others who had the most need. Even though I will never be a Gan- dhi or Mother Teresa, they influenced me to go into a field where I can help others. Personal experience or historic event Mrs. Wallace was my seventh-grade school counselor. I was making bad deci- sions and getting into trouble. In our first meeting, she said she cared about me, she knew I could do better and she wanted to see improvement. With her support and help, I started doing bet- ter in school and made more positive choices in the community. My life would be much different if it weren't for her. I always remember thinking that Mrs. Wallace had a cool job. w Mary Finn Maples Past president of ACA and the Associa- tion for Spiritual, Ethical and Religious Values in Counseling; professor emerita, University of Nevada, Reno; president, TLC Inc. (T ransition Life Coaching) Counseling theory or model My theory, which has been questioned as \"an oxymoron\" by my students, is Christian existential humanism \u2014 not to be confused with secular humanism.Past counselor or other helping professional The greatest influence on my counsel- ing career was C. Gilbert Wrenn, whom I met in 1979, when we did workshops together for Search Institute in Minne-sota. Earlier, I had read his Counselor in a Changing World and knew there was no other path for me. Then I read The World of the Contemporary Counselor, which sent me on for my Ph.D. So meeting him was the professional highlight of my life, until he and Kathleen presented me with the Gilbert and Kathleen Wrenn Award for a Caring Person in St. Louis in 1981. Because of Gilbert's influence, there has been no one to take his place. His work is as timely today as it was when he began his career at Western Oregon College in 1926. Person outside the profession The other greatest and most profound influence in choosing a counseling career was my own father. He was my hero, and I wanted to do something that would make him proud of me. He was so tough that when I received my Ph.D., his only response was, \"OK, Mary, what next?\" Personal experience or historic event Back in 1958, I was a P .E. teacher in Burns, Ore., and one of my most talented student-athletes attempted suicide. I felt so helpless and knew then that I had to learn more about human behavior and how to help. So I started my master's degree in counseling to help people like Marilyn. w Charles Pemberton Licensed Professional Clinical Coun- selor and principal therapist, Dimensions Family Therapy. Besides my practice, I am an adjunct professor at the University of Louisville School of Education and Human Development and at Jefferson Community College. I am also currently president of the Kentucky Counseling Association. Counseling theory or model I report in my initial session with a cli- ent that I am a cognitive-behaviorist. De- pending upon the specific problem and developmental level of the client, I lean toward behavioral or cognitive therapy. Specifically, I follow much more of Ellis' rational emotive behavior theory than any other cognitive model, although I do use Beck's terms more than Ellis' due to the fact that clients tend not to like the term \"irrational.\" On the behaviorism side, I focus on the ABC approach, with exten- sive time spent on teaching a behavior modification model to parents. Past counselor or other helping professional Dr. Kathleen Kirby continues to ground me in assessment issues. Dr. Bill Braden models a client-centered approach that I often lack. I refer to other thera- pists as well due to their specific attitudes and approaches. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Dr. Robert Wubbolding. While many may not consider reality therapy contem- porary, I have found all of his books and workshops extremely useful due to his focus on tools and interventions rather than theory. In my day-to-day practice, I always need more tools to reach people and refreshers on those tools that I haven't pulled out in awhile. Person outside the profession My father had to be the biggest influ- ence but not necessarily in the way most think. I was choosing my undergraduate major, and upon telling my parents that I was choosing psychology, my father said, \"There is only one thing you can do with a bachelor's in psychology; get a doctor-ate.\" With that, the gauntlet was thrown down, and several years later, I received my Ed.D. Personal experience or historic event I knew for several years that I wanted to be in private practice, but I took a strange path to get here. Besides working in the education field, residential facilities and the community mental health setting, I worked in the business field for over five years. I was part of a small company that spun off another division, opened an of- fice on the other side of the country, tried to go public and was sold to a multina- tional competitor. I worked in all areas, from marketing/sales to human resources and contract negotiations. This provided me hands-on experience in business that many in private practice never get. I was able to learn from others' business mis-takes and see the high points of owning a business, all while learning about technol-January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 45ogy.

Counseling theory or model I have found Adlerian theory and prac- tice to be the most compatible with both my philosophy of counseling and need for pragmatism. It is what we refer to as a \"psychology of use.\" As a former public school teacher and school counselor, I learned that theory will only take you so far. Plain-speaking, commonsense meth- ods that both challenge and encourage others will win them over to cooperation and respect for self and others. Past counselor or other helping professional Dr. Rudolf Dreikurs has had the most profound effect on my approach to not only counseling, but life in general. I had the privilege of getting a little time to visit with him and to appreciate that he lived what he taught. His work and example from articulate writing, lectures and counseling demonstrations have been a great inspiration to me. Contemporary counselor or other helping professional Initially it was Dr. J. Melvin Witmer (Ohio University) through our writing on wellness and counseling. Mel's earlier work on Pathways to Personal Growth preceded our Wheel of Wellness model for counseling. Since our early work to-gether with Mel, Dr. Jane E. Myers has laid a foundation for decades to come in promoting both research and practice in counseling for wellness. She has helped me learn to live what we teach, just as Rudolf Dreikurs helped me to see Adler's individual psychology as a way to live and not just teach or counsel. Person outside the profession I remember being invited as a high school student to meet with a bank presi- dent who had witnessed me messing up the start of a song I was solo performing for an audience. I had asked the pianist to please start over after only a few bars. She did, and I went on with the performance without a further hitch. His message was direct and simple: \"You have great prom-ise for the future. Hold on to that idea.\" I took his advice and have tried to encour-age others as he encouraged me. Personal experience or historic event As a high school student, we had \"deans of men and women\" who were ostensibly there to \"counsel\" us. I recollect nothing of the sort. They issued hall passes from their offices and were quasi-administrators. When it was time for me to talk about my college plans, the principal met with me and shared that in spite of my favorable grades, my promise for college was none too good! When I was teaching junior high school students, I realized I wanted to help my students in ways that classroom schedules did not permit.

What inspired me to leave my previ- ous careers of nursing and journalism to follow my true calling? It was always there. I was influenced by my father to follow in my deceased mother's footsteps and become a nurse. But it did not fully fulfill me, and I confess to spending some rather unpleasant moments with unhappy nursing matrons who found me too involved with my patients' problems. I chose to leave, went into journalism and had a great career with lots of good memories and traveled the world. It wasn't until I had a nasty car accident that I was forcefully given time to think about \"What now?\" during a long reha- bilitation. Limited physically, I read and read. Books by Dr. Wayne Dyer, Richard Carlson, the Dalai Lama ... the list is too long. Who has influenced my work the most? I would say Drs. Courtland Lee and Wayne Dyer. Dr. Lee is the author, editor or coeditor of four books on multicul-tural counseling and the author of three books on counseling African American males. In addition, he has published numerous book chapters and articles on counseling across cultures.Wayne W. Dyer is an internationally renowned author and speaker in the field of self-development. He's the author of 30 books, has created many audio pro-grams and videos, and has appeared on thousands of television and radio shows. I find that I use different therapies that may apply to the individual I am counseling and how they communicate. These therapies includes person-centered and psychodynamic, cognitive behavior therapy and gestalt. But there are more options out there that I find very benefi-cial to clients, such as emotional freedom therapy and NLP (neuro-linguistic pro- gramming therapy), which is a fantastic tool for phobias and many other condi- tions. Focus therapy is another great tool for individual and couple therapy. w Carolyn Rollins President-elect of the American Reha- bilitation Counseling Association; associ- ate professor and program coordinator, Albany State University, Albany, Ga.

Past counselor or other helping professional Initially, I was influenced by Dr. Emmett Burkeen, a counselor educa- tor at the University of Kentucky. It was Dr. Burkeen who suggested that I take a counseling course as an undergraduate elective. I was also influenced by my ma-jor professor, Dr. Bruce Shertzer, who was a counselor educator at Purdue University. My work was influenced and encouraged by a colleague and mentor at Vanderbilt University, the late Dr. Roger Aubrey. Person outside the profession I believe there were at least three per- sons who influenced my decision to become a counselor: my mother (Edith), my aunt (Clara) and my husband (Charles). Personal experience or historic event I was always a good listener who liked people and wanted to see them succeed. I was both interested in and fascinated by the counseling process. Collectively, my desire to study counseling, my inclination to be in a career that placed me in contact with people and my receiving a full schol-arship combined to influence my decision to enter the counseling profession. w M. Angela Smith Licensed Mental Health Counselor and Certified Substance Abuse Counselor, Hawaii Biggest influences On March 7, 1985, I had a spiritual experience by divine intervention that changed my life 180 degrees. At that point, I feel I was called to the profession of counseling. After reading Carl Rogers' biography, I realized he was a man after my own heart. Thus, my orientation be- came Rogerian. By a process I realized the need to be eclectic. Over the past 20 years, I have worked in diverse settings. I recently resumed my private practice, Oahu Counseling Ser-vices, doing business as M.

O'Bryant Past president of ACA; dean, School of Professional Studies, Coppin State Uni-versity, Baltimore Counseling theory or model I am a behavioral cognitivist, but Bill Cross' identity concepts and multicultural counseling theory probably influenced me the most and provided an integration mechanism for my own personal growth. Past counselor or other helping professional Dr. Thomas Parham helped shaped the direction I ultimately took toward merging my interest in politics with my love for the counseling profession. He was then president of the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Develop- ment, and I was the president-elect of the American School Counselor Associa-tion. These focused conversations ulti- mately led to one of my goals during my presidential tenure at ASCA to sponsor the first legislative weekend. This event brought state school counselor presidents, president-elects and government relations chairs to Washington, D.C., to learn the legislative process and lobby for the then Elementary School Counseling Demon-stration Bill. Person outside the profession My mother, the late Mrs. Gertrude Robb Jones, was the most influential per- son in my life. I always had an interest in working with and advocating for others. My mother told me there was nothing I couldn't do, to follow my heart and to surround myself with individuals who possessed similar positive energies. My husband, attorney Michael T. O'Bryant, was most influential in en-couraging me to enter national leadership within my chosen counseling profession. Personal experience or historic event As president-elect-elect of ACA, I at- tended the ACA legislative workshop for leaders. That workshop completely changed my direction as a counselor. It made me acutely aware of the need for counselors to be legislatively astute and ever cognizant of public image and persona. As a result, my focus during my tenure in leadership through ASCA, ACA and AMCD became more concen- trated in professional development for colleagues and training for students in counselor advocacy and engagement in the political process. u Due to space limitations, some of the respondents' answers were shortened.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org48 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 Assisting incarcerated women Going behind bars to counsel a high-need population By Jenny Christenson W hen Kim Mapp left the jail where she counseled women in Bergen County, N.J., four years ago, something unex- pected happened. Women inmates gave her handmade cards and gifts made from their pillowcases. \"It was rewarding to me, and it was a chance for them to tap into their artistic skills, to give back and to work together,\" says Mapp, who today works for the Center for Alcohol and Drug Resources and as a student assis- tance counselor in East Rutherford, N.J. While some people may question whether counselors can have much of an effect working with prison populations, Mapp says she was encouraged to see not only that she could help, but that this popula-tion of women actually desired help. About 10 years ago, the state of Texas fired all of its prison counselors as part of a cost-cutting measure, recalls Joycelyn M. Pollock, professor of criminal justice at Texas State University-San Marcos. Yet Pollock believes that counseling is actu- ally a very effective and necessary process in prisons. \"Of course, you can run a prison without counselors, but I'm not sure what you are accomplishing besides incapacitation. Women in prison respond to treatment,\" says Pollock, the author of Counseling Women in Prison. \"In fact, they plead for it, and they give high marks to any kind of group or treatment program.\" While counseling does have a positive effect on incarcerated women, she says that effect is often hard to measure right away. \"The treatment may not take effect until years later when they are ready to put it into action,\" she says, \"but that doesn't mean that they didn't listen and remember.\" According to recent incarceration data published by the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, an estimated 1.8 percent of women will serve time in prison (compared with 11.3 percent of men). Many experts believe that women end up in prison based on issues and experiences that distinguish them from most of their male counter- parts. As explained by Pollock, the path- ways model, a model developed in the criminology field, contends that women commit crime as a result of different life pathways, specifically histories of sexual and physical victimization as children, drug issues and the effect of having chil- dren. In addition, she says, the pathways model teaches that relationships have a much greater influence on women's psychological development. According to Pollock, about 40 percent of women offenders have been victimized sexually or physically. In addition, she says, \"More women offenders have drug dependen- cies than men do in prison populations. It seems to be more of a salient issue for women. Drug use for women may have stemmed from earlier life experi- ences\" that differ from those of men. For example, she says, women may use drugs as self-medication to get over childhood abuse or for a mental health issue. An \"inside\" look As most counselors would anticipate, the therapeutic environment in prison is drastically different from that of the \"out- side\" world. Even so, counselors might be surprised by some of the distinctions. For example, counselors, prisoners and prison officials won't necessarily have the same goals. \"All prison employees are expected to promote and protect security,\" Pollock says. \"Issues of confidentiality may come up if there is a security threat.\" If a client reveals confidential information that could affect the security of the prison, the counselor must tell prison authorities. She says some counselors have also re- ported that prisons expect mental health professionals to make prisoners more docile through the use of prescription drugs rather than focusing on improving the inmates' mental health. The challenge of optimizing the mental health of women prisoners is further January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 49complicated by the fact that many inmates bring significant problems with them from the outside. These problems might include a lack of life skills, sexual victimization, codependency, serious mental health issues, drug addiction and high-risk sexual behavior. \"All these are impossible to treat in isolation, and all are difficult to address in prison,\" Pollock says. \"I think it is a perfectly acceptable goal (for counselors) to help a woman deal with the prison experience itself and learn to have healthier relationships in prison rather than reduce the possibility of recidivism.\" Dianne Barber, a counselor for the Hillsborough County Department of Corrections in Londonderry, N.H., points out there is long-term value in beginning the process of counseling in prison because it increases the likelihood that these women will also seek treat-ment after their release. \"In addition to problems with prior abuse, there is a sig- nificant percentage of women (prisoners) diagnosed with personality disorders that are very difficult to manage,\" says Barber, a member of the American Counseling Association. \"It can be a long and tedious process. These women benefit greatly from weekly counseling.\" Another consideration when working with incarcerated women is that, in many instances, their needs and concerns aren't just individual. Whatever happens to them is likely to have a powerful impact on their families, says Vanessa Alleyne, associate professor and coordinator of the addictions studies program in the Montclair State University Department of Counseling and Educational Leadership. \"Because women occupy a central and organizing role in so many families, incar-ceration then has a major disruptive effect on families in ways that are unique to women,\" she says. \"That's not to say that men don't play an important role, because they do, but women are the primary care-givers in families.\" Children are especially affected when someone is removed from the role of primary caregiver, she asserts. In many instances in which the mother goes to prison, families are dissolved and children go to foster care. At that point, there is often a domino effect. \"Children who are put into foster care are not always able to stay connected to their mom who is incarcerated\" because prisoner contact with the outside world is limited, Alleyne says. \"Contact is seen as a privilege, not a right, in the correctional world. If there are any infractions, that is the first privilege to go. You lose your visitation rights or phone rights, or you get put in lockdown or solitary confinement.\" Women who are more verbal and asser- tive about needing help are more likely to receive counseling assistance, Alleyne says. \"It is very much a squeaky wheel environment,\" she asserts. On the other hand, \"There are counseling avenues. Most prisons and jails are required to have health networks in place. Help may come through a nurse or physician who is treating something physical and who then may make a referral for counseling as well.\" There are also certain populations of women prisoners which counselors are unlikely to hear from or see, Alleyne says. These include illegal immigrants who have been picked up for immigration charges. \"Many women cannot speak English, and translation is very limited, so they are cut off in ways that are unimagi- nable,\" she says. \"In theory, translating services are provided by the INS (Immi- gration and Naturalization Service), but they are not at the level that they need.\" Areas of need While prisons aren't the first place most counselors think about when expressing their desire to better society, the needs and opportunities are plentiful. \"If you are interested in doing clinical work, jails and prisons are ideal places to do that kind of work,\" Alleyne says. \"There is a tremendous need for short-term counseling, crisis counseling and group counseling. Certainly, this is one of the best places to get solid experience in drug and alcohol counseling.\" She adds that direct service in prison humanizes a very dehumanizing environment. In addition, she says, well-trained counselors can pro- vide models and learning opportunities for correctional staff, potentially making a positive difference in how incarcerated women are treated. \"There's lots to do for incarcerated women,\" Alleyne notes. \"Talented coun-selors and academics are needed to bring their expertise to the forefront. These are environments where one can truly get involved and make a real difference for good.\"Alleyne is a member of ACA, the International Association of Addictions and Offender Counselors and the As-sociation for Counselor Education and Supervision. After graduating, she gained an in-depth knowledge of women's issues while running groups in the women's unit of the Bergen County jail in New Jersey. At the request of the sheriff, Alleyne also produced a needs assessment, which led to a collaboration between the jail, the Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (under the leadership of Ellen Rocca) and the master's counseling students at Montclair State. A report produced by the team provided the evidence needed to develop an in-house women's drug treat-ment program. \"A counselor goes to counteract all the negative effects of prison life,\" Pollock says, adding that therapeutic groups, in particular, can have a positive effect on inmates. She cites an example in which an art teacher ran a group for five women prisoners who had committed multiple infractions during their incarcerations. During the entire time the group was running, the women stayed out of trouble with prison authorities. When asked why, the inmates said they looked forward to the group and knew the art teacher wasn't going to judge them. That provided enough support for the women to make good choices and maintain themselves. After the teacher left and the group ended, Pollock says, the women started getting into trouble again. Another area in need of more coun- selors is case management, Alleyne says, particularly in terms of helping people connect with services outside of jails and prisons after they are released. \"People usually get released at 12:01 midnight, with just enough money for a bus ticket and what they came with,\" she says, \"so their life is out of sync. What are they supposed to do? There is lots of help needed with linking people up to viable services.\" According to Barber, counseling wom- en in prison can also reduce recidivism rates by addressing some of the problems people had before entering prison. \"Edu-cation on mental illness, where applica-ble, and drug and alcohol addiction is so key to creating awareness and insight into their individual diseases,\" Barber says. \"Empowerment is also important because 50 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 the majority of incarcerated women were never taught healthy functioning and ap- propriate coping skills. If they had more insight into all the contributing factors that bring them back to jail or prison, the recidivism rate would decrease.\" Alleyne says the biggest challenge counselors must overcome to counsel incarcerated women is probably just fac- ing personal fears \u2014 \"the fear of getting hurt, the fear of being locked in. It is very intimidating to go behind bars and have your movements monitored so closely. It takes some appreciation and adjust- ing. People have a fear of working with incarcerated people that starts to diminish once they do it. But (women prisoners) are the same people as you and me. They have the same fears, joys and desires as everyone else. As long as you are genuine and professional and offer appropriate assistance, you're going to have a good experience and be able to help.\" Counselors may also find that their own struggles come up in the process of interacting with women inmates, Mapp says. For example, issues of rape, abandonment and not receiving the care one needed while growing up might be issues that both inmates and counselors have in common. Having appropriate supervision in their work with incarcer- ated women can help counselors in these situations, says Mapp, who was super- vised by Alleyne. Alleyne suggests that counseling stu- dents interested in working with people who are incarcerated take course work on substance abuse and treatment, as well as learn more about co-occurring disorders and the impact of trauma on women. Adds Barber, \"T raining in criminal justice as well as mental health and psychology is important, as well as having general knowledge of the psychological nature of those who have been incarcerated more than once or twice.\" (See sidebar above for more suggestions.) In preparing to work with incarcerated women, Mapp suggests that counselors pay attention to their own biases. For example, she says, most women prisoners are not what society regards as \"hardened criminals\"; roughly 80 percent are there for drug-related offenses. \"In many ways, those women were like me,\" Mapp says. \"They just made a lot of different choices along the way. But many of the women I encountered were educated, were moth-ers, daughters.\" u Jenny Christenson is a staff writer for Counseling Today. Contact her at jchristenson@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgVanessa Alleyne, associate profes- sor and coordinator of the addictions studies program in the Montclair State University Department of Counseling and Educational Leadership, offers the following recommendations for students considering a counseling career in the criminal justice system. 1. Take coursework to become more knowledgeable about substance abuse and treatment. This is particularly im- portant in forensic settings. 2. Learn more about co-occurring dis- orders, as well as the impact of trauma on women. 3. The best way to overcome fear of this environment is by being exposed to it. Utilize opportunities to speak to and visit with counselors in criminal justice settings as well as with people who have been incarcerated. If you are in a prison or jail setting, make sure that you have good supervision from clinical staff who have appropriate experience, authority and credibility to work effectively with you as you negotiate the environment. 4. Raise your level of awareness about the far-reaching impact of criminal justice issues. Now more than ever, counseling students are likely to have contact with a student or parent who is dealing with or has dealt with the crimi-nal justice system, either through arrest, incarceration, adjudication, parole or probation. 5. Consider an area in which you currently have an interest, and see if you can apply it to forensic settings. Grief, trauma, substance abuse, people of color, group work, juvenile justice and other areas of counseling are all found in forensic settings. Counseling in the criminal justice systemJanuary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 51 52 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 Making the most of the mentoring relationship ACA members discuss how mentoring helps to build better counselors By Jenny Christenson \"Overwhelmed\" is how Rachel Hoffman describes feeling when she started her master's program in counseling. In fact, she remembers, the idea of becoming a professional counselor just didn't seem real to her at the time. Then, she says, \"one of my counseling teachers helped me to map that out and told me the steps to take. That really broadened my horizons.\" The professor became Hoffman's mentor, encouraging her to expand her idea of what it meant to be a professional counselor by joining associations and advocating for the profession. Today, Hoffman is a doctoral candidate at Kent State University and serves as a mentoring liaison herself. Hoffman isn't alone in her experience. Because of the complex role they play in clients' lives, many counselors and counselors-in-training find that they can use extra assistance in the form of mentorships. \"Mentoring is a matter of working with somebody to help them become more grounded in the practice of their profession,\" explains Bret Hendricks, an associate professor of counselor education at Texas Tech University and a member of the American Counseling Association. This most often involves someone with longevity in the profession figuratively walking beside a less experienced colleague \u2014 usually a student \u2014 to help that person with his or her professional development or scholarly work. \"As far as the student goes, we try to impart to them what it means to be a professional counselor, what it means to practice ethically and, looking at the macro level, things such as social justice and advocacy,\" says Hendricks, immediate past president of the International Association of Marriage and Family Counselors, a division of ACA. Hendricks has helped to establish mentoring relationships between students at Texas Tech and professional counselors in the community and has also worked as a mentoring advocate, encouraging the Texas Counseling Association to involve counselors-in-training at all levels of the state association. \"Mentoring is so integral to being a counselor that it is hard to extricate it,\" Hendricks says. \"It is just part of who you are as a counselor to connect not just with clients, but with the profession.\" He believes counselors have an ethical responsibility first to seek out good mentors for themselves and then to return the favor later by serving as mentors to others. \"Whatever mentoring we do helps the counselor and, ultimately, the client,\" he points out. Angela Shores, a doctoral student in counselor education at North Carolina State University and assistant director of academic advising at Meredith College, both in Raleigh, N.C., has a similar perspective. \"Mentoring provides an opportunity to serve and teach the next generation of counselors, thereby providing service to one's profession,\" she says. Shores has participated in a formal mentoring program through the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision, a division of ACA, and served as a mentor herself in a more informal setting. Mentoring in the counseling profession is both different from and similar to mentoring in other professions. Says Hoffman, \"I think it is different than counseling a teacher, for example. The day-to-day activities are different. Sometimes mentoring in the counseling profession includes more clinical skills, January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 53and sometimes mentoring covers more administrative skills. It becomes more situational.\" While mentoring at the micro level is influenced by counseling's theories of practice, the overall mentoring processes and concepts are generally the same across all professions, Hendricks adds. Some of the benefits of mentoring seem obvious in a profession as challenging as counseling. \"It is important for people to feel supported. It was valuable to have many people along the way giving me feedback, both in my doctoral program and in the process of looking for jobs in academia. I think it is beneficial that we have others who help us along the way,\" says Hoffman, who as president of the Kappa Sigma Upsilon Chapter of Chi Sigma Iota spearheaded development of a mentorship program for doctoral students called FLASH (Forming, Linking, Achieving, Succeeding, Helping). But mentoring relationships can also offer other less recognized, though equally important, benefits to mentees, including opening doors to networking and research opportunities and assisting in the development of a wider perspective of the profession and the professional role of counselors. Mentoring can also provide strategies for successfully navigating graduate school, writing a thesis or dissertation, or pursuing licensure. Having a mentor can also help mentees navigate a system that is governed in part by unspoken rules, says ACA member Valerie Schwiebert, author of Mentoring: Creating Connected, Empowered Relationships and a professor of counseling at Western Carolina University. \"Mentors provide support to their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in an effort to remove organizational barriers, to assist prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in negotiating the 'system' and to provide prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with opportunities for upward mobility,\" she explains. Because they have already experienced some aspect of the system, mentors can offer guidance concerning what mentees need to do to succeed in an organization. Finding a mentor Mentoring relationships often begin informally. \"There's such a loose definition of mentoring,\" Hendricks says. \"It could be teaching a class, or it could be sitting down and having coffee. I would say most of us in the (counseling) field have been mentored, whether we'd call it that or not. Engaging in those sorts of relationships is mentoring.\" Many relationships are initiated by would-be mentees simply approaching a professional colleague and asking that person to be their mentor. But, as Hendricks points out, \"You can recruit in either direction. A mentor can go to a mentee and say, 'I can make myself available.'\" More formal mentoring relationships are often established by an intermediary, such as a graduate school or a professional association. \"Joining your ACA branch is a great way to share experiences with other counselors in your area,\" says ACA Chief Professional Officer David Kaplan. In certain counseling programs, senior students serve as mentors for beginning students. While these mentorships typically end when students graduate, other mentoring relationships last indefinitely. \"It's almost like a family,\" Hendricks says. \"Once you have this mentor relationship, it goes on. You still have that bond 10 years down the road,\" even if the mentor and mentee don't see each other for several years. Although there may be times when the mentoring relationship isn't as strong and the dialogue isn't so frequent, ideally, he says, the mentee should feel that he or she can still seek out the mentor at any time. Guidelines are often helpful when it comes to maintaining ethical mentoring relationships, Schwiebert says. \"When a power differential exists that governs my behavior, I need to make sure that I am operating ethically, particularly in dual- role relationships,\" she explains. One benefit of formally established mentoring relationships is that they are more likely to be conducted under the ACA Code of Ethics, Schwiebert adds. (In particular, refer to Standards C.6.d., \"Exploitation of F F .10.d., \"Nonprofessional Relationships.\") Power differentials aside, the mentor should invite the mentee to engage in a conversation about what he or she wants out of the relationship, Hoffman says. \"The mentoring relationship is more a collaborative journey, where both can learn from each other, with the ultimate goal that the mentee feels that he or she is well prepared and has the ability to make decisions,\" she says. Each mentoring relationship should be unique, Shores adds. \"Mentoring is defined by the mentee and the mentor, so based on their needs, expectations and interests, mentoring can be quite a creative adventure.\" Hendricks says the mentoring relationship should play itself out on two levels. At the micro level, the relationship focuses on how mentees can grow in their understanding and application of counseling theories. At the macro level, mentors should teach their mentees that they will be at their best only if they take care of themselves properly, participate in wellness activities and set appropriate boundaries. The wellness aspect of mentoring can help mentees successfully integrate their many facets of life, including work, family and school. Schwiebert has introduced another perspective on mentoring, creating the word \"womentoring.\" She explains that womentoring is the more feminine-driven aspect of mentoring, whereby women use their inherent strengths in building relationships to teach oday | January 2009how to create connected, empowered relationships without sacrificing other people as they move up the ladder of success. This community-building take on mentoring can be applied to both men and women, Schwiebert says, and can be used by all groups of people, both in counseling and other professions. Challenges in mentoring While few counselors would deny the potential benefits of mentoring, making the time to establish or nurture a mentoring relationship is often a challenge. \"We, as counselors, get tunnel vision about what we are doing because we are so busy,\" Hendricks says. \"Too many times, mentoring gets pushed to the back seat because it is not a pressing issue.\" One of the best ways for counselors and counseling students to minimize the challenges of time constraints and the sometimes spotty availability of mentors is to get involved in their professional organizations and take advantage of formal mentoring programs. The Texas Counseling Association has encouraged students to become a part of the organization and reap the benefits of membership, including participation in a mentoring program, Hendricks says. \"Mentoring is a self-perpetuating process,\" he says. \"If you are well mentored, then you will become a good mentor.\" Another often unforeseen challenge is allowing the mentoring relationship to remain fluid enough to accommodate changes in the mentees' role as their careers advance to the level of their mentors or beyond, Schwiebert says. One solution is to \"make mentoring more formalized between the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, because then the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can explain his or her specific needs, and the mentor can tell if they can help them,\" she says. With each change in the mentee's career, the mentoring relationship has to be renegotiated. But even when mentees and mentors become professional equals, Schwiebert says the relationship can remain beneficial because each participant has specific strengths and skills that can be shared with and taught to the other. Developing trust in the relationship is another common challenge, Hoffman says. Mentees can alleviate some of these trust issues before they even enter into a mentoring relationship by developing clear expectations for what they want from a mentor. Then, Hoffman advises, mentees should actively try to engage someone who will be a good fit for them. Finding this good mentoring match is another challenge, of course. Shores suggests mentees look for someone who is engaged in the same kinds of research, advocacy or counseling techniques that they are interested in or want to learn more about. But don't let a slightly imperfect fit ruin the potential to have a genuinely beneficial relationship, Hendricks advises. Oftentimes, he says, dedication and commitment within the mentoring relationship can overcome differences in personality. \"Some of the people with whom I have the best relationships don't have personality types anywhere close to mine,\" he says, \"but they know the value of commitment.\" And in the big picture, Hendricks says, commitment is more important than personality type. Finding a good mentor-mentee match can be even more difficult for counselors from minority or subdominant cultures. \"There are so few role models out there for them,\" Hendricks says. \"It is so important for minorities to find mentors, and yet there is no clear road map for that.\" The counseling profession generally acknowledges that finding a mentor of the same race, gender or socioeconomic background is ideal, in large part because the mentor can relate to many of the challenges the mentee is facing, which helps to build a higher level of trust. But while \"it would ultimately be best if people could be mentored by someone from the same cultural group,\" Hendricks adds, \"I think it is most important to have a mentor, period.\" Regardless of the mentee's background, an important tool in finding a good mentor match is networking. \"Most people who are successful are so because they have relationships and networks that provided opportunities in their lives,\" Schwiebert says. \"Most giants in the counseling field have multiple mentors.\" In her book, Schwiebert states that \"mentoring is most effective when the individuals share similar values, attitudes, goals and worldviews.\" However, she goes on to say that both parties can benefit from cross-cultural mentoring relationships because they can \"expand their awareness and understanding of individuals from different backgrounds.\" These relationships can also be very powerful because the participants demonstrate unity and acceptance \u2014 two of the very principles most counselors advocate. Effective mentors Many of the qualities and skills needed to become an effective mentor are already second nature to counselors. \"Being available and listening and encouraging people, especially on the wellness aspects, are important,\" Hendricks says, adding that if mentees are not taking care of themselves properly, they cannot be effective counselors. \"Don't concentrate so much on theory and technique that you ignore the bigger picture of wellness,\" he says. Having an open dialogue with mentees is also important. This involves helping mentees to determine what is best for them instead of making decisions for them. As Hoffman points out, this often means \"not just providing quick answers.\" As counselors mature as professionals in the field or in academia, they can give back to the profession and to society by becoming mentors. \"As we find our own places in life, we can assist others in negotiating their own journeys toward shared goals, visions and attainment of personal and professional accomplishments,\" Schwiebert says. Adds Hendricks, \"I think that the counseling profession is one that needs advocacy. For us to present a united front, to present consistent messages to the public, we must be mentoring one another. We must be talking to one another.\" u Jenny Christenson is a staff writer for Counseling Today. Contact her at jchristenson@counseling.org.

Counselors who converge on the Queen City from March 19 to 23 will also likely be enchanted by the charming nightlife taking place beneath that skyline. Aside from the nightlife this financial center is known for today, Charlotte also boasts a world-class outdoor recreation and environmental education center, the U.S. National Whitewater Center, just 10 minutes from downtown. Charlotte is also home to many noted museums, including the Mint Museum of Art and the Levine Museum of the New South. Have an eye for the old? ACA member Sara Graham dubs Charlotte \"one of the best places in the Southeast to go antiquing.\" And a look into Charlotte's history reveals that it was a hotbed of military action during the Revolutionary War. It also became a central location for the nation's first gold rush in the early 1800s. Today, Charlotte exists as a cultural and dining destination for residents and visitors alike. ACA members who live and work in and around Charlotte were only too happy to sing the praises of the Queen City, so follow their advice and share in their appreciation of this gem of the South before, during and after the upcoming ACA Conference, which is being cosponsored by the North Carolina Counseling Association.

Charlotte is the home of Johnson & Wales University; chefs from J&W work throughout the city cooking delicious meals for its residents and guests.Charlotte's most overlooked treasure I'd say that Charlotte's most overlooked treasure is its spirit of openness and communication. Charlotte is where the busing laws passed in the 1970s and where the community came together to work through the difficulties. Charlotte has always seemed to have a can-do attitude, and the people of Charlotte make it so. w Your tour guide Lorelei Lindow has been a member of ACA since 1998 and has lived in Charlotte since 1977. Lindow has a private practice in Charlotte as well as a clinical counseling position at Johnson & Wales University. \"Must-see\" list In the Uptown area where the ACA Conference will be held, there are several places to consider, including Discovery Place with an IMAX Theatre, the Mint Museum of Craft + Design, ImaginOn, Time Warner Cable Arena (where the Charlotte Bobcats NBA team will be having a home game!), Bank of America Stadium (where the Carolina Panthers NFL team plays), Spirit Square, Actor's Theater, Blumenthal Performing Arts Center (where Broadway plays are offered), Levine Museum of the New South and Johnson & Wales University. Favorite places to eat, drink and be merry I am a \"foodie,\" so this is a difficult question to answer! In Uptown, guests have a huge number of restaurants to try. Some moderately priced places include Brixx, Zink, Ri Ra, Mimosa Grill or Pie Town. For a more indulgent meal, try Morton's, Capital Grille, Blue, LaVecchia's or HOM. Some of my favorite restaurants are just outside of the Uptown area and include Pike's Soda Shop (which has an amazing brunch on Sundays), Mert's (Southern \"soul\" food), La Paz (Mexican), Cajun Queen and Boudreaux's (both with New Orleans-style food), Lupie's (the best sweet tea, macaroni and cheese, and banana pudding around!), Nikko (sushi), Zada Jane's (breakfast), Mac's Speed Shop (barbecue), The Penguin (greatest burgers!), Thai Taste, Copper (Indian) or 300 East (beautiful and cozy environment).Best nightclubs and bars In the center of Uptown is a new area called the Pavilion at EpiCentre where there are several new restaurants and bars: Black Finn (upscale sports bar), Suite, Howl at the Moon (who doesn't enjoy dueling pianos?!) and Whisky River. Other places are due to open by March at the EpiCentre. In other areas of Uptown, dance clubs to visit include the Breakfast Club, Forum, Crush or Velocity, and bars to explore are Connolly's or Cans. If you're feeling adventurous, just outside of the Uptown area are places for live music: Visualite, Neighborhood Theater, Amos' Southend or the Double Door Inn. First-time visitors will be surprised to learn Charlotte recently added a light rail called LYNX! It can help you get around Uptown and beyond. Also, the trolleys in Uptown are free. What makes Charlotte unique Charlotte is a clean city with Southern charm and a church on every corner. The residents are friendly and can help you get around the very confusing street name changes that start just outside the Uptown area. Charlotte's most overlooked treasure I love going to the art gallery crawls \u2014 one in the Southend area and the other on North Davidson Street (and 36th Street). They are usually offered on the first and third Fridays of the month. w Your tour guide Sara Graham has been a member of ACA for three years and has lived in Charlotte for 30 years.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgCharlotte toursJanuary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 61 Counseling transgender adults Creating safe, empowering environments inside and outside our offices By Sean Moundas, Anneliese Singh, Julia Hosea, Denise Pickering, Alex Roan and Theodore Burnes The counseling profession is in need of guidelines to educate counselors, supervisors and counseling students on the issues of transgender individuals and their loved ones. Indeed, the February 2008 Counseling Today article on transgender youth, \"Counseling transgender youth: Education, advocacy and resilience,\" prompted over 50 inquiries for more information from the T ransgender Committee of the Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and T ransgender Issues in Counseling. As members of the T ransgender Committee, we are excited counselors are interested in and want more information about working with transgender clients. The word transgender is an \"umbrella term for persons whose gender identity and expression do not conform to norms and expectations traditionally associated with their sex assigned at birth\" (Lambda Legal, 2008). Gender identity is a person's internal experience of being a woman, man or another gender, whereas a person's biological state of \"female\" or \"male\" refers to one's genetic sex, and gender is a social construction referring to society's expectations of individuals as men or women. A full discussion of language and definitions appropriate for use with transgender people is beyond the scope of this article. However, counselors should be aware that many transgender people do not want to have body modifications, or may select some body modifications (for example, hormone treatment) but not others (for example, surgery). Essentially, because there is such a wide variety of gender identity and expression within the transgender community, counselors should seek to explore and affirm the gender identity and expression that feels most congruent for their clients. Because transgender adults experience extensive discrimination, counselors should be well versed on advocacy issues for this group. The number of hate crimes documented by the National Center for T ransgender Equality suggests that 2008 was one of the most violent years on record. T ransgender individuals and their significant others routinely describe instances of discrimination in the workplace, inadequate and disrespectful medical and mental health care, and transphobia by family members and society. These stressors may put transgender adults at higher risk for experiencing depression, anxiety and substance use. While counseling programs prepare counselors to address mental health and psychosocial issues such as family issues and anxiety disorders, many counselors are quite unprepared to work with gender-variant transgender individuals because of deficient training regarding gender identity and expression. One area that is particularly lacking is helping transgender people navigate through the medical system should they desire medical interventions involving body modifications.62 | Counseling T oday | January 2009Diagnosis, medical and nonmedical treatment Currently, gender variance is labeled as a mental health disorder (Gender Identity Disorder or GID) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Because this diagnosis pathologizes their gender identity, transgender people may feel that living in their identified gender socially and physically is contingent on engaging in the medical system \u2014 namely with counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists and other physical and mental health professionals. There is a wide-ranging debate on this issue, with some advocating for GID to be removed from the DSM and viewed as primarily a medical issue, while others assert the importance of counseling and psychological professionals as gatekeepers for transgender people who transition from one gender to another. Counselors should be aware of this debate and be able to clearly communicate to potential clients their approach to diagnosis as a part of the informed consent process. We believe counselors can play a unique role in the lives of transgender clients by taking a strengths-based approach that acknowledges their resilience and weaves advocacy into the counseling process. Counselors should also be aware that the World Professional Association for T ransgender Health (formerly known as the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association) created Standards of Care (SOC) that helping professionals should follow when assisting transgender clients with body modifications or other aspects of living their lives in their identified gender. These guidelines are intended to be flexible rather than dictates of treatment. Because of the SOC, many surgeons and physicians require documentation from a mental health professional before they will allow transgender clients to modify their bodies with surgical and/or hormonal treatment. Depending on client goals, counselors may help transgender individuals navigate an often overwhelming system, while also recognizing that clients are ultimately the primary experts on their own gender identity. It is also important for counselors to know that not all individuals will undergo the same process if they choose to transition from their gender assigned at birth to a gender in which they feel more congruent. Thus, one of the goals of counseling may be to support a client in exploring congruence between her or his gender identity and physical body, reminding clients that they can define for themselves what this congruence \"looks like\" regardless of which medical and/ or surgical options they select or do not select. Because counseling goals can be wide ranging for transgender clients, counselors should be familiar with the social or medical changes clients may want to make. These changes may include obtaining a legal name change, changing gender designation on official documents (driver's license, Social Security card, birth certificate, passport), hormone treatment and \"top\" or \"bottom\" surgeries. A transgender man may undergo chest surgery, a hysterectomy and/or genital reconstruction, while a transgender woman may have electrolysis (hair removal), breast augmentation and various types of plastic surgery. Importantly, other transgender people may make few or no physical changes but elect to have a name change and/or begin using pronouns consistent with their gender identity. Furthermore, the decision regarding how to proceed during transition is influenced by many factors, including the availability of financial resources (many of these procedures are costly and not covered by insurance), overall health, societal or familial pressure and personal preference. For some transgender people, body modifications are not a priority or something desired. In these cases, counselors should support transgender persons in defining what is best for them. Career counseling Whether transgender people choose medical or nonmedical treatment, counseling issues often include attention to career concerns and professional development, especially because this population often faces systemic barriers to realizing their career aspirations. T ransgender people often experience discrimination at work, as evidenced by the case of Vandiver Elizabeth Glenn, who was fired from her job as a legislative editor when she began her transition from male to female. There are currently no federal legal protections for transgender people in the workplace. An initiative designed to protect LGBTQ people \u2014 ENDA (Employment Non- Discrimination Act) \u2014 failed to pass Congress in 2007. Counselors may draw upon their unique training in career counseling to assist transgender clients by providing them with legal resources and knowledge about the lack of current federal protections. Because of employment discrimination, transgender people may be tracked into a limited spectrum of jobs that are not a good match for their interests, skills and personality. In these cases, counselors may share the rich career development literature and assessments with their clients and provide them with knowledge of job search skills (informational interviewing, writing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters) and assistance with identifying safe environments in which to work. Counselors will often find themselves using their role as advocates in working with transgender adults on career concerns, from offering to speak with the client's employer about providing transgender-affirmative training to connecting transgender clients with community resources designed for them. For instance, some university and local LGBTQ centers plan transgender career fairs developed to connect transgender people with affirmative employers and different career paths. Counseling issues with families When a transgender adult discloses her/his gender identity, family members may experience a wide variety of reactions. Members of the same family may even have disparate reactions vacillating between being accepting and unsupportive. While there are differences in the degrees of family support and understanding, Arlene Istar Lev (2004) identified four common stages family members experience: discovery and disclosure of gender identity, turmoil, negotiation and finding balance. During the first stage, family members learn of the transgender person's gender identity either directly or indirectly, which often launches them into a stage of confusion and distress. Subsequently, they typically attempt to reach a compromise with their transgender January 2009 | Counseling T oday | 63relative about their gender expression but hopefully are eventually able to accept and integrate the transgender person's gender identity/expression. These stages are not meant to be strictly linear, but it is important that counselors know that transgender clients' family members may cycle through certain stages. Initially, some parents and siblings may experience intense anger, confusion or grief when a transgender person shares about her/his gender identity. They may have a difficult time accepting that they have lost the daughter/sister or son/ brother whom they thought they knew so well. Other family members may have an easier time accepting the gender identity early on because they have access to more transgender-positive information. In these cases, family members may even become advocates for their loved ones who are transgender. In other cases, partners struggle to renegotiate their marriage. Some spouses are not prepared to be in relationship with a same-sex partner, while gay/ lesbian partners may not be prepared to be in a relationship that is perceived as heterosexual. Furthermore, some spouses cannot handle the social stigma of being in relationship with a transgender partner. However, other partners are able to embrace the transgender person's identity within the ongoing couple relationship. T ransgender adults who are parents may have social and emotional concerns related to sharing their gender identity with their children. In particular, the parent may grapple with addressing children's concerns about introducing their friends to the family and helping their children understand negative community attitudes toward transgender people. When coming out to children, it is important to tell children in a private space, allow the conversation to continue over time and explain the parent's gender identity in a developmentally appropriate way while communicating that the children's thoughts, feelings and questions are important. An emerging body of resources for children who have transgender-identified parents can be accessed through the Internet (see gender.org). Finally, transgender people have multiple identities, so in addition to their gender identity, counselors should assess for the salience of their other identities as well. For instance, transgender adults of color may want to connect with other people in their community who understand their experiences of gender and race/ethnicity. Counselors should not separate how the cultural backgrounds of transgender adults shape their experiences of family, values, traditions and other important aspects of their daily lives. Therefore, counselors who work with transgender clients and their family members must be aware of family, cultural and societal biases and assumptions about sexual and gender diversity as well as psychopathology. Competent counselors will comfortably and compassionately validate all forms of gender expression and sexuality while being sensitive to the multiple layers of the responses of parents, siblings, partners and children. Moreover, they will affirm the resilience and determination of transgender people who must confront transphobia and more subtle invalidation as they actualize their true selves. u T o contact the Transgender Committee of ALGBTIC, e-mail Theodore Burnes at burnes@gse.upenn.edu or Anneliese Singh at asingh@uga.edu.

New York: The Haworth Clinical Practice Press.64 | Counseling T oday | January 2009 He methodically steps behind the center, alert eyes darting left and right, analyzing subtle alignments in the defense and determining the best course of action for his team. Quickly and aggressively, he starts pointing and shouting out directions, detailing each of his teammates' imminent responsibilities. Simultaneously, the defense, led by its middle linebacker, is making adjustments of its own, compensating for possible weaknesses and trying to anticipate the intentions of the offense. This is the intellectual chess game that you will witness prior to every play, mere seconds before hulking men collide, helmets and pads crashing into one another, on any given Sunday in the National Football League. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning and his coaches have seemingly perfected the art of the spontaneous offense in football, scoring almost at will in recent years. It has struck me that watching Manning assess and exploit his opponents' weaknesses is not unlike watching a master counselor cut through a difficult client's mundane chatter and fortified resistance. Experience and training allow counselors to anticipate their clients' reactions and direct the course of therapy to efficiently and effectively help clients think, feel and behave in new ways that improve their quality of life, even if they are often initially resistant to such change. The quarterback metaphor has grown especially meaningful to me over the past year as I have transitioned from an elementary school counselor, comfortably working with primarily white children in a rural area, to a counselor education doctoral program, where I counsel diverse clients from a myriad of cultural backgrounds. Time and again, my initial self-doubt and anxiety have been diminished by the relative success I have experienced in working with each new population and replaced by a reflective curiosity concerning how I was able to adapt my approach for such different clients. While I am still a rookie in many ways \u2014 and far from the master counselor described earlier \u2014 I believe I have stumbled upon a series of pointers that might help others who appreciate interpreting the counseling of diverse populations through the lens of a football quarterback. I hold the following list of six self-guiding instructions mindful each time I meet with a client of a different age, gender, ability, race, ethnicity, class or sexual orientation than my previous experience has allowed. 1. Be flexible and trust your instincts. I imagine Peyton Manning experiences a sense of flow when his abilities and the challenge of his circumstances coincide and climax in one moment. As an elementary school counselor, I too have often felt a flow experience when working with children. This happens when my mental and emotional abilities are met with the sometimes daunting yet manageable challenges that my clients bring to session. Both the master quarterback and the master counselor are alertly prepared to modify their actions based on what he or she is seeing, hearing and sensing in the moment. I imagine that I am not alone in experiencing this thrilling occurrence while counseling, and I can say that, for me, it is truly one of the most exhilarating and satisfying elements of being a professional counselor. 2. Have a game plan and believe in it. As a former collegiate athlete and high school football coach, I know the importance of proper preparation. What fans see in the game is actually the product of weeks of hard work and planning. Many football teams now script their first 10 or 20 offensive plays so that their players know what to expect and can prepare themselves to have immediate success. Likewise, when I am preparing to meet with a new client whose background is different from that which I am accustomed, I am certain to have my goals, objectives and strategies for my first session or series of sessions outlined. This preparation gives me the confidence I need to be successful and helps to instill my clients with confidence in me, creating expectancy for success. This second point might seem counterintuitive to the first, but I don't believe that it is. Flexibility and spontaneity are most successful when utilized as an extension of a well-conceived game plan. 3. Don't let one or two mistakes ruin your game. In football, almost every coach tells his quarterback that he has to have a terrible memory. Future Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre holds the all-time NFL record for the most interceptions thrown in a career (not a good thing). He also happens to hold the NFL record for most career touchdown passes. Counseling is an inexact science and may be better understood as an inexact art. Mistakes will be made, and I've certainly made my share. But if I let each poorly worded observation or occasionally clumsy interpretation ruin an entire session, I've not only let myself down, I've let my client down as well. When I make a mistake, I own it, apologize if appropriate and move on toward success. Counselors, just like quarterbacks, are human too. 4. Don't be afraid to take a time-out. Even star quarterbacks such as Peyton Manning sometimes need to take a time-out to slow things down or to discuss the current circumstances with their coaches. Similarly, in counseling, I have occasionally found myself in situations or discussing topics for which I was unprepared. In other instances, I have felt conversations or emotions accelerating a little out of control. One of the best courses of action I have taken in these situations is to invite my client to take a few moments with me to think about where we are at in the moment and what we are experiencing. In football, they call If Peyton Manning can do it ...Reader Viewpoint - By Richard AlbrightJanuary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 65 it a time-out. In counseling, we call it mindfulness. 5. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is hand the ball off. If you watch a Colts game, you'll undoubtedly see the following scenario unfold. At least once or twice each game, Manning will go through a long series of loud commands and animated signals that, one might assume, are surely designed to orchestrate one of the most intricate and glorious schemes in football history ... only to simply hand the ball off to his running back. That's because when Manning sees a weak spot in the defense, he calls a play to exploit it, and it doesn't seem to matter if the spotlight is on him or his teammate. I have found the same simple approach especially useful when engaged in team meetings with parents, teachers and administrators. I believe counselors should have a good understanding of their own strengths and insights, as well as the strengths and insights of each of the other individuals in the meeting. In situations when I am asked a question that is in someone else's area of expertise, I am more than happy to defer or hand the ball off to that person. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that counselors' unique experiences and distinctive skill sets often provide them with key insight into the complex dynamics in such meetings. As such, counselors have a corresponding responsibility to help direct the course of the conversation to efficiently and effectively utilize the unique strengths of each group member. 6. If all else fails, go back to the basics. As a scholastic football coach, I have repeatedly told my athletes that although we design each play to score a touchdown, the reality is that only a select few will actually accomplish that goal each game. Often, the team that executes the basic fundamentals of the game will dictate the contest's ultimate outcome rather than the team with the flashier trick plays. When I'm stuck in a counseling session, I try to be mindful that my basic active listening skills \u2014 reflecting, paraphrasing and summarizing \u2014 are often the best tools I have at my disposal. Whether in football or in counseling, I have found that the three simple p's of persistence, perseverance and patience usually cultivate the most success. So whether you are an experienced master counselor or, like me, just beginning your long journey toward multicultural and counseling competence, I wish you much success in experiencing the thrill of tapping into the potential that each session with your client holds. Oh, and one more piece of advice: Don't forget your celebration dance in the end zone! Experiencing success with a client is a truly special happening and should always be celebrated. u Richard Albright is a doctoral student in counselor education at Penn State University and a part-time substance abuse counselor with Counseling Alternatives Group in State College, Pa.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org66 | Counseling T oday | January 2009We founded the National Center for School Counsel-ing Outcome Research to be a resource for the profession. The Cen-ter provides practitioners access to practi-cal information from outcome research that they can use to have greater impact in their work. We also conduct outcome research and work with the research com-munity to promote more and better out-come research. During times of economic distress, we typically receive a number of e-mails and phone calls from school counselors in districts that are considering eliminating counseling positions. These counselors are often seeking references to research that proves school counselors are effec-tive. Unfortunately, we anticipate having to field these difficult questions much more frequently this year. To be helpful, we usually start by ask- ing callers what they are doing that has already been demonstrated to be effec-tive by research. Typically, callers draw a blank. So we go down a list of programs, interventions and practices that have good research support. With that prompt, callers can sometimes identify things they are doing that are supported by research; too often, they cannot. We then have to explain that no research exists to prove that school counselors are effective (nor will there ever be). Effectiveness depends mostly on what school counselors choose to do; outcome research tests the effec-tiveness of things that school counselors do. Counselors who choose to base their practice on this literature can justifiably use it to advocate for their positions and their programs. Counselors who both ground their practice in outcome research and evaluate the effectiveness of their work locally are in an even stronger posi- tion for advocacy. Not all research is outcome research. Outcome research is intended to test whether a specific practice, intervention or program reliably results in important benefits for our clients. Good outcome research produces critically important information on effectiveness that practi- tioners need in order to decide what to do and what not to do. Outcome research can improve the effectiveness of a school counseling program by influencing the decisions that counselors make. Choosing to implement an intervention that has proved to be effective (rather than one that has no evidence for effectiveness) is likely to result in greater benefits for students. Using outcome research to guide practice also has some practical utility in terms of local accountability initiatives. Counselors who need to demonstrate their effectiveness locally can at least argue that they are making sound pro-fessional decisions and doing the right things to benefit their students. Local evaluation of interventions with good outcome research can be expected to result in more positive findings because these interventions tend to have a larger impact. Also, these practices are typically easier to evaluate because many of the needed dependent measures can be found within the original research studies. Stumbling blocks If outcome research is so important, why aren't more school counselors us- ing it? We have identified several major problems within the counseling profes- sion that hamper a stronger connection between practice and outcome research. First, the preparation of counselors is not strongly rooted in outcome research. Decisions about what to teach (and what not to teach) in counselor education programs are often based more on theo-retical models and personal preferences than on sound evidence for effectiveness. As the American Counseling Association increases its focus on strengthening coun- selor education, more attention needs to be paid to the important issue of how we use research evidence to decide what to teach in the counseling curriculum.Second, practitioners have limited ac- cess to the full range of outcome research that would be helpful in guiding their practical decisions. Many potentially useful studies are published outside the mainstream counseling journals, and most articles published in counseling journals are written more for research- ers than for practitioners. Our Center is helping to address this access issue by using the Internet to distribute research briefs that summarize the practical impli-cations of a wide range of outcome re-search studies. More efforts of this nature are needed within the profession. Third, it is sad to say that within the school counseling profession, not enough good outcome research is being conducted. This very fundamental problem needs immediate and sustained attention if the profession is to gain strength and continue to grow. The origins of this problem are complex and multifaceted and need to be addressed comprehensively. Good outcome research is expensive, and grants to support research in counseling are limited. Professional advocacy is needed to influence government entities such as the Institute of Education Sciences to increase support for outcome research in areas central to school counseling practice. Additionally, this problem is complicated by the fact that not enough researchers are interested in and/or capable of conducting high-quality school counseling outcome research. Counselor education doctoral programs need to focus their efforts on producing a professional cadre of outcome researchers. ACA and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) can be instrumental in providing the help and encouragement needed as standards for doctoral programs are reconsidered. Finally, not enough researchable interventions are designed to achieve What is outcome research, and how do we get more of it?CSCOR Perspective - By John C.

The profession must mobilize to develop a wider range of research-based inter- ventions that impact important career, personal/social and academic outcomes. These interventions will need to be stan-dardized so different individuals in dif- ferent settings can deliver them with rea- sonable fidelity. These interventions also need to supply a strong enough \"dose\" of active education ingredients so they can be expected to have a strong impact on students. Collaborations between teams of practitioners and counselor educators and the creation of a national center to provide leadership, direction and coordi- nation would be very helpful. Model of success While we have too few researchable in- terventions, we do have some good mod- els for their development \u2014 for example, Greg Brigman's work on the development of Student Success Skills (SSS). Brigman started his design work by reviewing the educational psychology research literature to identify specific cognitive and personal- social skills demonstrated to be strongly related to increases in achievement. Then he developed the SSS school counseling curriculum to teach these skills. SSS can truly be said to be research-based. Brig- man also designed the curriculum to be reasonably standardized. Furthermore, a series of outcome research studies by Brig- man and Linda Webb have demonstrated that the SSS curriculum reliably results in gains in achievement that are reflected in state achievement test scores. Enhancing outcome research is a pow- erful and important long-term strategy for increasing the capacity of school counselors to impact clients' lives. The profession, however, must make a sus- tained investment in activities that will support the development of researchable interventions and the use of outcome re-search to guide professional decisions. u68 | Counseling T oday | January 2009North Atlantic Region looking to fill position of treasurer Submitted by Bob Schmidt serenitysh@aol.com Want to get more involved in your association on a regional level?

As the official journal of Coun- selors for Social Justice and Psychologists for Social Responsibility, JSACP stands on the principle of open access; therefore, it is published electronically and is avail- able free online to anyone in the world. The first two issues have been published and are available at psysr.org/jsacp. JSACP strives to provide readers with articles that promote reflection on com- munity change and system transforma-tion in which counselors and psycholo- gists play a role. Articles published thus far have focused on such topics as social action research, theory, transformative practice, social justice training and com- munity empowerment and collaboration. While the majority of articles reflect scholarship, JSACP also publishes forums titled \"Community Voices\" and \"Student Voices,\" respectively, as well as personal reflection pieces that promote social ac-tion and critical reflection. This electronic journal upholds the highest academic and professional standards and is available in PDF format with articles in either Eng-lish or Spanish. Manuscripts are reviewed through a masked, peer-review process. JSACP is seeking manuscripts year round. For editorial policy and other in-formation, visit psysr.org/social-action.htm. Potential authors may also contact edi-tors Tod Sloan and Rebecca Toporek to discuss creative ideas that reflect the prin-ciples of the journal. JSACP is hosted by the Department of Counseling Psychol-ogy at Lewis and Clark Graduate School of Education and Counseling.

The initiative equips businesses and the workforce development system with tools to help those affected by TBI and/or PTSD succeed in the workplace. Although their injuries may not be vis- ible, veterans experiencing combat stress or a brain injury may face difficulties, especially with respect to employment. They may struggle with headaches, ver- tigo, balance problems, anxiety and sleep disturbance, among other symptoms. They also may experience cognitive symptoms such as short-term memory deficits, poor concentration and decision-making difficulties that can interfere with everyday activities, both inside and out- side the workplace. DOL wants employers to know that simple workplace supports often can help individuals with TBI and/or PTSD suc-ceed in their jobs and that employment can play a major role in their recovery. A comprehensive website, AmericasHeroes AtWork.go v, offers support and educa- tion concerning ways to assist returning service members with TBI and PTSD in their transition into the workplace. Specifically, it educates employers, human resources professionals, the workforce development system and vocational reha- bilitation professionals on accommoda- tions they can make for employees living with a brain injury or combat stress. It also provides a toll-free phone number (800.526.7234) that employers can call for personalized assistance related to ac- commodations for veterans with disabilities. Examples of accommodations for peo- ple with TBI or PTSD include lighting adjustments to prevent headaches, tape recorders to help with memory or a quiet workspace to support concentration. Other promising practices include job sharing, job coaching, flexible schedules and workplace mentoring.People to People counseling delegation headed to China, Tibet Jane Goodman, a past president of the American Counseling Association, invites counselors to take part in a unique over- seas cultural and professional exchange opportunity.
