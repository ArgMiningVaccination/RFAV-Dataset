Methods A phase I rst-in-human dose-ranging trial of a saRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate LNP-nCoVsaRNA, was conducted at Imperial Clinical Research Facility, and participating centres in London, UK, between 19thJune to 28thOctober 2020. Participants received two intramuscular (IM) injections of LNP-nCoVsaRNA at six different dose levels, 0.1-10.0 mg, given four weeks apart. An open-label dose escalation was followed by a dose evaluation. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for one week from enrolment, with follow-up at regular intervals (1-8 weeks). The binding and neutralisation capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody raised in participant sera was measured by means of an anti-Spike (S) IgG ELISA, immunoblot, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoneutralisation is registered: ISRCTN17072692, EudraCT 2020-001646-20). Findings 192 healthy individuals with no history or serological evidence of COVID-19, aged 18-45 years were enrolled. The vaccine was well tolerated with no serious adverse events related to vaccination. Seroconversion at week six whether measured by ELISA or immunoblot was related to dose (both p <0.001), ranging from 8% (3/39; 0.1mg) 0.3 mg) to 87% (20/23; 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg) in a post-hoc immunoblot assay. Geometric mean (GM) anti-S IgG concentrations ranged CI, 45-119) at mgt o 1023 (468-2236) ng/mL at 5.0 mg( p<0.001) and was not higher at 10.0 mg. Neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 by partici- pant sera in 15% (6/39; 0.1 mg) to 48% (11/23; 5.0 mg) depending on dose level received. Interpretation Encapsulated saRNA is safe for clinical development, is immunogenic at low dose levels but failed to induce 100% seroconversion. Modications to optimise humoral responses are required to realise its potential as an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND is a novel technology with signicant, and previously untested, potential for translation into human use in the development of novel drugs and vac-cines. Vaccines against COVID-19 require production technology that is highly scalable to meet global demand and readily modiable to combat the emer-gence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those with the potential to escape vaccine-induced immunity. 1 COVID-19 vaccines may also be needed that allow for easy and acceptable repeat administration to boost immune responses that wane after initial vaccination orrecovery from natural infection.2Vaccines developed using encapsulated saRNA have unique features, whichinclude low dose administration and a readily modi- able antigenic domain making it possible to formulate vaccines rapidly. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an RNA virus which encodes replicon. Previ- ous clinical experience of particles (VLP) derived from an attenuatedVEEV strain. CMV and HIV vaccines based on this design induced modest neutralising and binding anti- body responses respectively in phase I clinical trials,although anti-VLP immunity was also observed after immunisation. 3,4 We developed a candidate LNP encapsulated saRNA COVID-19 vaccine which demonstrated anti-SARS- CoV-2 immunogenicity in small animals even at ultra- low doses (0.01 \u00b5g).5The vaccine is 11,507 nucleotides in length and encodes the replicase composed of non- structural proteins (NSPs 1-4) from the VEEV as well a pathogen-specic immunogen, the spike (S) glycopro-tein from SARS-CoV-2. Manufacture of the vaccine isentirely synthetic and does not require any form of virus culture, a signicant hurdle in scalability and delity to the wild-type virus strains for many licensed vaccines. 6,7 The vaccine is injected intramuscularly and LNP encapsulation facilitates endosomal uptake and release into the cytoplasm vivo initially amplies the complete a process of driven by the internal subgenomic promotor. 8No potentially infectious structural proteins are expressed, as these have been replaced by the vaccine GOI, a codon-opti- mised SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. The full-length Sglycoprotein is presented as a membrane tethered tri- mer and includes two proline amino acid substitutions (2P-S, K968P and V969P) that, when the prefusion conformation rendering it inca- pable of facilitating fusion. 9 Expression kinetics of the vaccine in mice indicate protein expression to peak at seven days and resolve by21 days, similar kinetics are observed when injected ex vivointo human skin explants. 10,11Pre-clinical toxicol- ogy studies in rats indicated no observed adverse eventsup to 10.0 mg (the maximum dose tested). Importantly the potential of this technology predicted from numer- ous preclinical studies has not previously been assessedResearch in context Evidence before this study Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated self-amplifying (sa) RNA is a novel technology for use in vaccines andtherapeutics. Alphavirus replicons have shown promise in preclinical models against multiple targets. We searched PubMed from June 22, 2012 to Oct 9, 2021,with the search terms \"self-amplifying RNA \"AND \"clini- cal trial \", and no clinical studies assessing the safety and immunogenicity of LNP encapsulated saRNA had been published. Added value of this study Here we observed that clinical use of an saRNA vaccine (LNP-nCoVsaRNA) expressing the pre-fusion stabilisedspike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 raised no short- term safety concerns and was well tolerated, with few- est reactions at low doses. The vaccine was immuno-genic but neither seroconversion rates, up to 61% (14/23; 10.0 mg), measured by ELISA and 87% (20/23; 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg) measured by immunoblot, nor SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation rates reached 100% in any dosegroup. Implications of all the available evidence To our knowledge, this study is the rst to provide safety and immunogenicity data on the use of encapsu-lated saRNA for vaccine development including pan- demic COVID-19 vaccines. Human responses to SARS- CoV-2 were signi cantly lower than those predicted by small animal models. Understanding species speci c differences in innate regulation of saRNA expression may prove critical to improved vector design and devel-opment of better preclinical models.Articles 2 www.thelancet.com Vol 44 Month February, 2022in humans. We report the preliminary ndings of a phase I dose ranging trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of six dose levels (ranging from 0.1 mg to 10.0 mg) of the candidate saRNA COVID-19 vaccine, LNP-nCoVsaRNA. Methods Study design and participants We report the results up to 8 weeks of the dose escala-tion and evaluation components of a protocol that pro- ceeds to an expanded safety cohort in preparation for anefcacy trial (see protocol version 8.0, Appendix 1). Ini-tially, three different doses (0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg) were assessed in 120 participants enrolled at a single centre (NIHR Imperial Clinical Research Facility). Followingreview of safety and immune responses by the Trial Steering Committee, three higher doses (2.5 mg, 5.0 mg, 10.0mg) were assessed in 72 participants enrolled from three centres (NIHR Imperial Clinical Research Facility; Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; NIHR UCLH Clinical Research Facility, Univer-sity College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust). Healthy participants aged 18 45 years were recruited through local advertisements. Participantswith no history of COVID-19 were eligible to take part.All participants underwent a screening visit where a full medical history and examination was performed in addition to blood and urine tests. Participant sera werescreened for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using the Abbott Architect nucleocapsid IgG assay (N IgG) and for the presence of blood borne viruses using a fourthgeneration HIV test and for IgG against Hepatitis C. Those with reactive responses in any of these tests were ineligible for the study. Full details of the eligibility cri-teria are described in Appendix 2. Written informed consent was obtained from all par- ticipants, and the trial conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clin-ical Practice. Participants were offered reimbursement for their time, inconvenience, and travel expenses of \u00a350 per visit paid as a lump sum at the end of the partic-ipation. This study was approved in the UK by the Medi- cines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the North East - York Research Ethics Committee (refer-ence 20/SC/0145) (ISRCTN17072692, EudraCT 2020- 001646-20). Randomisation and masking lower and higher dose cohorts included an open-label dose escalation phase (15 and 12 participants respectively). Subsequently, participants were allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio (centralised computer-generated list,block size 3) to the three doses either by individual ran- domisation (lower dose cohort) or based on the day when they were vaccinated (higher dose cohort).Additional detail is provided in Appendix 2, Table 1 . Laboratory staff and participants (apart from the dose escalation phase) were blinded to the dose allocation. Procedures LNP-nCoVsaRNA is a self-amplifying ribonucleic acid(saRNA) V987. 9The saRNA is generated from a DNA template by in vitro transcription with co-tran- scriptional capping (m7G(50)ppp(50)(20OMeA)pU; Tri- Link). The RNA is formulated with lipids (ionisablelipid (proprietary to Acuitas)/phosphatidylcholine/cho- lesterol/PEG-lipid) to obtain the LNP-nCoVsaRNA drug product. Conduct of the trial. The trial evaluated six dose levels of LNP-nCoVsaRNA as two intramuscular (IM) injec-tions into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm, given four weeks apart. The vaccine was formulated as a suspension for injection in multi-dose vials stored at-70\u00b0C. On the day of injection, it was thawed and diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to give a nal vol- ume of 0.5mL for injection for dose levels from 1.0 mgt o 10.0mg. The 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg doses were prepared to give a nal volume for injection of 0.2mL and 0.6mL respectively. Participants were observed for up to one hour following each immunization. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were self-reported by participants in electronic diary records captured the evening after injection and for six further evenings.Study staff checked the diary record approximately 48 hours later and at the day seven visit. All these events were considered related to vaccination. Causality wasdetermined by the site investigators. Blood samples were collected at days 7, 14, 28, 35, 42 and 56 (haemo- globin, white cell creatinineand non-fasting glucose). Grade was determined accord- ing to the FDA toxicity table for healthy volunteers, adapted to site laboratory normal reference ranges (seeAppendix 2). Immunological assessments. Sera were heat inactivated for 30 mins at 56 \u00b0C prior to storage at -20 \u00b0C before assessment in immunological assays. Binding antibody concentrations induced by the vaccine in participantsera were assessed using an anti-S IgG ELISA in 96 well plates coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the 13 14 (45.8%) 10 (41.7%) 73 (38.0%) Age at last birthday (years)Median (IQR) 34 (28, 39) 31 (27, 40) 31 (24, 39) 33 (25, 39) 31 (25, 40) 36 (29, 39) 33 (25, 39) Range (4.2%) 2 (8.3%) 1 (4.2%) 11 (5.7%) Asian or Asian British 2 (5.1%) 2 (5.1%) 4 (9.5%) 2 (8.3%) 1 (0.5%) BMI Mean (SD) 25.1 (4.20) 24.9 (3.84) 25.2 (4.51) (6.10) 24.9 (4.58) 25.6 (4.99) 25.2 (4.57)Median (IQR) 24.0 (22.8, 27.9) 24.2 (21.7, 26.9) 24.8 (22.0, 27.0) 24.3 (22.4, 26.5) 23.6 (22.0, 27.9) 24.8 (21.2, 13 155 Chelsea Westminster (0.0%) (0.0%) (45.8%) 8 (33.3%) 27 (14.1%)Days from of participants enrolled and treatment details.Articles 4 www.thelancet.com Vol 44 Month February, 2022optical density (OD) 450nm readings from uncoated wells (blank wells) were subtracted from readings in test wells. Vaccine-induced seroconversion to anti-S IgGwas considered to have occurred in those where there was an OD of above 0.2nm in the ELISA. This threshold was set during optimisation of the ELISA using stand-ards from National Institute for Biological Standardsand Control (NIBSC), convalescent sera from individu- als recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and sera taken prior to December 2019. Baseline convalescentsera were available from 32 individuals enrolled into the wider COVAC1 trial with either a history of mild or moderate COVID or previously unknown, asymptom-atic SARS-CoV-2 infection. A positive control of pooled plasma samples from NIBSC was included in each assay plate. When it became available (December2020), the rst WHO international standard anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin was added at a concen- tration of 2 BAU/mL as an additional control. It was determined that 2 BAU/mL was the equivalent ofapproximately 20,000 ng/mL. For the immunoblots, 100ng of S protein was bound to a nitrocellulose plate and probed with sera from participants at baseline andweek 6. Blots subsequently probed with to The immunoblots weredeveloped using Immobilon Crescendo Western HRP substrate and read using Chemiluminescence Imager CELVIN /C210. The integrated density of each immunoblot was calculated using the Fiji Image Processing Package.12 Data are reported as a continuous scale of the integrated density. A cut-off value for positivity of 1.6log 10was deter- mined from the distribution of values observed at base-line (Appendix 2, Figure 16). Further analysis was conducted to assess potential non-specic cross-reactivity in the immunoblot assay and to compare its sensitivityrelative to ELISA (Appendix 2, Figures 17 & 18). SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays were conducted using pseudotyped (PSV) and wild type viruses at Impe-rial College London. Briefly for the PSV assay, pseudo- typed SARS-CoV-2 lentiviruses supernatant for 1 hour. HEK-ACE2 cells were then co-incubated with the sera and PSV for up to96 hours before measurement of the luciferase activity using dilution at which relative luminescence was reduced by 50% compared with control. For the PSV assay, the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin was included as a posi-tive control, which was determined to have an IC50 neu- titre of approximately 1:3000. Wild assays were conducted as previously described. 5Outcomes The objectives were to compare the safety and immuno-genicity of two injections with LNP-nCoVsaRNA givenfour weeks apart at six different dose levels. The safety outcome measures were solicited local injection site and systemic reactions that started within seven days ofadministration of the vaccine, and any of the followingthat occurred throughout the study period: unsolicited adverse reactions (ARs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and unsolicited AEs. These were reported through tofour weeks post second vaccine dose. Immunogenic- ity was assessed by the titre of neutralising antibod- ies two and four weeks after the second injection,and the titre of IgG raised against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein two and four weeks after the rst and the second injections. Statistical analysis Sample size was based on achieving adequate statistical power to detect signicant differences in IC 50neutrali- sation titres NT 50across dose groups. Results from the dose escalation and dose evaluation components of the trial, and the low and high dose cohorts, were com- bined. This paper reports initial immunological nd-ings at weeks 2, 4, 6 (vaccine 2 + 2 weeks), and 8 (vaccine 2 + 4 weeks). Two participants (allocated to 5.0 and 10.0 mg) were retrospectively identied as being anti-S IgG seropositive at enrolment and are excludedfrom all immunogenicity analyses (but retained in safety analyses). Binding and neutralisation antibody titres were analysed on a logarithmic scale and backtransformed for presentation. Tests for trend across dose groups were performed by assessing the coefcient for log(dose) in logistic regression models (for serocon-version outcome) and normal linear regression models (for antibody titres among those who seroconverted). Safety outcomes across all doses and grades were com-pared using Fisher's exact test. The rate of reactions fol- lowing the rst and second vaccines were compared using the Stuart-Maxwell test for marginal homogeneityimplemented in the Stata symmetry command. All analyses were carried out using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

All individuals enrolled received two injections; 5.7% (11/192) were outof the window period for the second injection but are included in the analyses. Overall, 96% (1479/1536) of visits were carried out in the window, including 97%(187/192) of vaccine 2 + 14 days and 96% (185/192) ofvaccine 2 + 28 days visits. Reactogenicity. The proportion of participants report- ing a systemic reaction increased signicantly with dose reaching 100% of those receiving 5.0 or 10.0 mg (p=0.0001). Severity also increased with dose and four(17%) of 24 participants who received 10.0 mg reported a grade 3 (severe) systemic reaction after the rst or sec- ond vaccine (see Appendix 2, Table 5.4). Common reac-tions reported Figure 2 B). Only one (1%) of 144 participants in dose groups 0.1-2.5 mg had a fever ( 38\u00b0C), whereas eight (17%) of 48 in the two highest dose groups recorded a fever, and in threeparticipants in the two highest dose groups this was 39.0-40.0 \u00b0C (grade 3). No-one reported a severe local reaction, and 53/192 (28%) reported no local reaction atall, but the frequency also increased signicantly withdose (p <0.0001) and 47 (98%) of 48 participants receiv- ing 5.0 or 10.0 mg reported a local reaction with one in three grading this as moderately severe. Overall, tender-ness/discomfort and pain were reported by 133/192 (69%) 1%) were uncommon ( Figure 2 A). Solicited reactions following the rst and second vaccine were similar overall with no signi cant differences in maximum grade of systemic or local reactions (p=0.06 Table 5.7 andp=0.52 Table 5.9, Appendix 2 respectively). This was also the case when the test for marginal homogeneity was applied to each unique reaction other than headache,w h e r eh i g h e rg r a d e so fh e a d a c h ew e r em o r ef r e q u e n t l yobserved following the second dose compared to the rst (p=0.01, Appendix 2, Table 5.8). Seven days after each vac- cination, laboratory safety parameters remained largelywithin normal limits (Appendix 2 p15-16, Figures 3 -13). Other adverse events. There were no SAEs considered related to the study intervention. Amongst the 137 (71%) participants reporting 394 AEs, 25 had a moderately severe event, and six had a severe or worse event(Appendix 2, Tables 5.10 and 5.11). Two of the six were hospital admissions (shigella infection, spinal fracture) and the other four were detected through grade 3changes in routine laboratory parameters. Two partici- pants had a transient grade 3 transaminitis associated with heavy exercise, a third had a grade 3 decreasein neutrophils considered to be due to untreated Graves 'disease, and a fourth had asymptomatichyperbilirubinaemia secondary to Gilbert's syndrome. Three participants had mild-to-moderate self-limiting AEs that merited a specialist opinion before proceedingwith a second investigational vaccine or authorised COVID-19 vaccine: a generalised rash following contact with food or topical agents; recurrent facial oedemadetermined to be stress-induced angioedema; and backpain accompanied by numbness and tingling in the extremities. Immunogenicity Binding antibody. Low rates of seroconversion to anti-S IgG were observed by ELISA in participants whoreceived 0.1 or 0.3 mg, only 3/39 (8%) and 10/39 (26%) at week six (two weeks after the second vaccination), respectively ( Table 2 ). The highest seroconversion rates occurred in the 10.0 mg group, 8/23 (35%) four weeks after the rst vaccination, increasing to 14/23 (61%) two weeks after the second vaccination. Intermediate rateswere observed in the 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg groups. Among those who seroconverted, anti-S IgG titres appeared to be higher at six weeks in the 5.0 mg group (GM=1023ng/ mL) and 10.0 mg group (GM=500ng/mL) compared with the lower dose groups. Most individual antibody concentrations ranged from approximately 100ng/mL to 2000ng/mL, broadly consistent with values derivedfrom convalescent sera ( Figure 3 A). Interestingly there were different patterns of response in the binding antibody (ELISA ) according to time after the rst and second injections. Thirty-two of 190 (17%) partici-pants responded to a single prime dose and this included participants in every dose group from 0.1-10.0 \u00b5g (Figure 4 A). Among the 32 participants who did respond to the prime dose, ve had no detectable response follow- ing the booster dose, 13 showed no or a marginal ( <0.5 log 10) increase in antibody titre, while 13 had evidence of a boosting effect ( >0.5 log 10increase); one sample was not collected at week six. A boosting effect was more com- monly observed in those receiving 5.0 or 10.0 \u00b5gb u tw a s also observed in those receiving a lower dose. Among the participants who showed no ELISA response four weeks after the prime dose, 37 (23%) sero-converted by two weeks after the booster dose(Figure 4 A). In those with a response at week six, most had a response at week eight (i.e. four weeks after the booster dose), but there were some whose response didnot appear until week eight and others whose response was present at week six but lost at week eight (Figure 4 B). Again, these patterns of response were seen in all dose level groups.

There was a statistically signicant trend in the rate of detection of neutralising antibody across the dose groups, but with no clear difference betweenthe 5.0 mg group (11/23 (48%) at week six) and the 10.0mg group (10/23 (43%) at week six). The NT 50geo- metric mean was higher in the 10 mg group than in the 5.0mg group at both six weeks (70 versus 47) and eight weeks (124 vs 40) but neither difference was statistically signicant (p=0.55 and 0.06 respectively). NT 50values following the booster dose were somewhat lower thanthose observed on convalescent sera ( Figure 3 B). Neu- tralising antibodies were detected less often, and at lower titres, with the wild-type assay than with the pseu-dotyped assay (Appendix 2, Figure 14). Sera from 25 individuals had neutralising activity measurable in the pseudovirus assay but no anti-S IgGbinding at week six by ELISA (Appendix 2, Figure 15).To understand this discordance, as a post-hoc analysis, we screened sera at week 0 and week 6 by immunoblot (Appendix 2, Figures 19). Overall seroconversion acrossall dose (61%), ranging from 20/39 (51%) and 18/39 (46%) for the lowest doses (0.1 and 0.3\u00b5g respectively) to 87% for 5.0 (20/23) and 10.0 \u00b5g (20/23) doses ( Table 1 ). A further eight individuals did not meet the criteria for seroconversion but demon- strated an appreciable change in signal intensity frombaseline. We detected seroconversion in 9/25 (36%) individuals where there was neutralisation but no bind- ing antibody. Discussion There were no unexpected safety issues in this shortperiod following two IM injections of LNP-nCoVsaRNAup to 10.0 mg in this cohort of 192 adults aged 18- 45 years. Two participants had adverse events that led to a delay in their second vaccines, which were adminis-tered with no recurrence. Reactogenicity was dose dependent, with the highest proportion of grade 3 reac- tions in those receiving 10.0 mg. The safety prole of LNP-nCoVsaRNA appears simi- lar to other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, where systemic and local reactions of grade 2 and above were common, particularly in younger adults. 13-15We saw no evidence of clinically signicant potentiation after the second dose, beyond a slight increase in grade 2 headaches. No allergic events were considered related to the saRNAvaccine, 16although this may reflect exclusion of sub- jects with a signicant allergy history. Doses of 1.0 mg and below were associated with very low levels of reacto-genicity. Seroconversion by ELISA was sensitive to doselevel, with maximum rates (14/23; 61%) at 10.0 mg. However, none of the groups reached 100% seroconver- sion with a range of 39% (9/23; 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg) to 61 % (14/23; 10.0 mg) for the 1.0-10.0 mg groups. The high- est titre of anti-S IgG antibody was in those receiving 5.0mg and was not further augmented in those receivingdouble this dose. Where seroconversion by ELISA occurred, anti-S IgG concentration was in the same range as IC50 wasslightly lower. The discordance ELISA triggered assessment of seroconversion by assay. revealed ahigher for 0.3 \u00b5g to 20/23 (87%) for doses (5.0 and 10.0 \u00b5g). Differ- ences between seroconversion by ELISA and immuno-blot reflect differences in sensitivity (see Appendix 2, Figure 18) between the two assays. This may reflect dif- ferences in the presentation of binding epitopes onimmobilisation of the spike glycoprotein to ELISA plates versus membrane. 17However, 16/ 59 participants positive by pseudovirus neutralizingassay were negative by both ELISA and immunoblot.Although observed by others, 18the reason for such dis- cordance is unclear but may reflect exposure of epitopes on pseudotyped virions not accessible or represented bythe puried recombinant protein. Interestingly, for on-going development, immune responses were observed at low dose levels (1.0 mg) and even at ultralow dose levels (0.1 mg, 20/39 (51%) by immunoblot). Nevertheless, the proportion neutralizing antibodies (14/42 (33%) and6/39 (15%) respectively) would not be sufcient for an effective vaccine. We present here an interim report of data obtained, the study is on-going, and participantswill be followed for 1 year. Data on cellular responses,epitope mapping and persistence of antibody will be reported elsewhere. In this saRNA vaccine design, only non-structural proteins are derived from VEEV preventing potentially infectious genetic reversion, reactogenicity from immune response to structural alphavirus proteins, oroff-target immunity. Pre-clinical studies of our LNP- demonstrated high levels of neu- tralising anti-S IgG even when given at 0.01 mg, with a dose response across a three-log range. 5Due to con- straints with vaccine preparation, the volume of admin- istration for the 0.1 mg dose level was 0.2mL. It is conceivable that this may have affected this very lowdose. However, immunogenicity was also low at 0.3 mg, and the most plausible explanation is that below 1.0 mg there was insufcient RNA payload within target cellsleading to suboptimal antigen expression. At 1.0 mg and above, the dose response by ELISA was more complex and hints at a potential mechanism forthe level of non-responders. Whilst increasing dose increased the reactogenicity, concentrations of anti-S IgG were not linearly affected, likely indicating persis-tently low antigen expression. It is possible that recogni-tion of both lipid nanoparticle and/or saRNA exposure by endosomal and cytoplasmic pathogen-associated saRNA amplication and antigenArticles 12 www.thelancet.com Vol 44 Month February, 2022expression.19,20Differences in threshold for triggering such pathways at an individual level may have influ- enced initiation of self-amplication and determinedwhether antigen expression levels were sufcient for seroconversion by ELISA and/or immunoblot. As the threshold for innate sensing is influenced by the basalstate of immune activation 21,22and given the different patterns of response to the rst or second injection irre- spective of dose, it is conceivable that innate activation from the rst immunisation may have impacted on thesecond. Indeed, the replication kinetics of saRNA, with antigen expression occurring for up to 21 days, 10,11sug- gests a four-week interval between doses may not beoptimal where a longer interval may be required to return to a more quiescent state. Pre-clinical models have been used to test an increas- ing breadth of candidate saRNA vaccines based on:VEEV; a combination of VEEV virus (reviewed in). 23Our saRNA back- bone was derived from the virulent Trinidad donkey strain of VEEV rather than its attenuated vaccine derivative, strain TC-83.24T h el a t t e ri n c l u d e saG 3 Am u t a t i o ni nt h e5 ' untranslated region which increases sensitivity to IFN- a/b and alters the secondary structure of this region.24Under- standing the impact of different 5' UTRs on response to saRNA and VEEV TC- 83 strain used for vaccination 25could provide further i n s i g h tt ot h ed e v e l o p m e n to ft his platform. Indeed, clini- cally, very little is currently known about how differentsaRNA designs perform. Current knowledge is likely to be further informed by two othe r candidate saRNA vaccines now in clinical trials, against rabies (NCT04062669) andCOVID-19 (NCT04480957). The two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pzer/BioNTech) now in widespread clinical use 26,27 performed better than our LNP-saRNA, demonstrating 100% seroconversion. Both mRNA vaccines use a similar, if not identical 2P-S presentation of the S glycoprotein as used in this study, formulated in LNPs, the Pzer vaccine using identical lipids.27These mRNA vaccines, incorporate the modied nucleobase methyl-pseudouridine to mini-mise innate recognition of the mRNA using higher doses (100 mg and 30 mg for Moderna and Pzer respec- tively) than those in this study. However, the compati-bility of modied bases with saRNA has not been established and these would be rapidly lost on amplica- tion. Furthermore, induction of innate restriction path-ways triggered within hours may have a greater impact on saRNA than mRNA given differences in kinetics of expression. 10,11Importantly the observed immunogenic- ity in humans was inferior to that observed in mice.This likely reflects differences in innate restriction of exoge- nous RNA sensing. 28-31Understanding species specic dif- ferences with respect to innate restriction of saRNAexpression may prove key to unlocking the true potentialof this technology for human sa n dd e v e l o p m e n to fm o r e predictive animal models. It is probable that these issues can be resolved through further renement of saRNA vac-cine design such as the inclusion of encoded modulators of human pattern recognition receptors (now undergoing clinical evaluation), 32use of alternative UTRs and a wider range of potential modications.33 This is the rst human study to report on the response to LNP encapsulated saRNA based on an alphavirus repli- con in humans. These data provide preliminary data intothis novel RNA platform technology. Nevertheless, responses with this construct were insufcient to meet the target for translation in Phas e 3 trials and further work is needed to rene the platform . However, global demand for COVID-19 vaccines will remain high in the coming decade, given the emergence of lethal SARS-CoV-2 escape-variants and expected requirement for booster vaccina-tion. 33If modied to improve antibody titres, encapsulated saRNA could provide potential advantages for vaccine development including scalabil ity, tolerability, and flexibil- ity in antigen design, to meet requirements for the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
