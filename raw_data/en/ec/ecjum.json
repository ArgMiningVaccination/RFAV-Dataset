Naturopathic medicine is a unique and comprehensive approach to optimizing health and treating illness. The naturopathic philosophy is to stimulate the body to heal itself by identifying and treating the root cause of a particular condition. It is based on the understanding that the human body is a complex mechanism held in a delicate balance through natural processes such as metabolism, optimal cellular function, and efficient organ function. Symptoms of illness signal that our balance is disturbed. Each person has an innate healing power, and the role of the Naturopathic Doctor is to remove obstructions to this healing power and facilitate it through gentle, non-toxic therapies.
