Control Group Control GroupsConclusions Main finding: Very large inpatient price increase, but statistically indistinguishable from control hospitals Data limited to inpatient prices: No information on post -merger changes in prices for outpatient services No information on post -merger changes in quality, requires claims data Unlike other states, COPA oversight has not been removed, even after 20 years (although explicit price regulation no longer in effect). Unlike in other COPAs, local competition has always been present. 32Conclusions (continued) Inpatient price effects from COPA mergers are particularly complex. Is there a lack of local competition? Does the regulation leave any gaps? Does the regulation expire, or is it likely to be repealed or amended? Are there coordinated effects from other hospitals that make relative price changes difficult to detect? 33References Dafny , L. (2009).

The difference- in-difference coefficients do not reflect actual prices. Coefficient values less than zero do not mean Palmetto hospitals lowered prices, but that they increased them at a slower rate. For example, in the first bar graph, the -13% coefficient for the bed capacity control group means that when Palmetto raised its prices by about 45% in the first five years of the COPA, the control hospitals raised their prices on average by 58%. During the original COPA period and the revised COPA period, we do not see statistically significant differences between Palmetto's price increases and the control group price increases, for nearly all control groups studied. 36Lien H. Tran and Rena Schwarz Bureau of Economics Federal Trade Commission PRELIMINARY: DO NOT CITE WITHOUT AUTHORS' PERMISSION 37The Mission Health COPA: Evidence on Price Effects from CMS HCRIS Data The views expressed in this presentation are those of the presenters and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Trade Commission.Background Memorial Mission and St. Joseph's were the only two general acute care hospitals in the city of Asheville, the county seat of Buncombe County, North Carolina . In 1995, they entered into a COPA agreement with the NC Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General's Office. In October 1998, Memorial Mission acquired all of St. Joseph's assets and combined operations under one license as Mission Health System (\"MHS \"). In 2016, the NC legislature repealed the COPA law, effectively ending the MHS COPA. In 2019, MHS was acquired by HCA Healthcare. 38Western North Carolina Hospitals 39 Regulations under the COPA Restriction on net operating margin: net operating margin of MHS to be no less than 3%, but no more than the mean operating margin of \"comparable facilities\" over any three year period. Comparable facilities were defined in the 1995 COPA agreement as non- profit , non- teaching facilities with 300 licensed beds or more. Similar restriction for average cost per adjusted- admission. Restriction on physician ownership: no more than 20 percent of the physicians practicing in family practice/internal medicine or general pediatrics in MHS's primary service areas of Buncombe and Madison Counties . Other terms: $74 million cost savings commitment, maintenance of quality and access to care, and fair dealings with insurers. 40Related Literature Margin and cost caps are key elements of cost -of-service regulation. This type of regulation allows a reasonable rate of return for a regulated firm, but does not incentivize managerial effort ( Laffont and Tirole,1993). Reports by Vistnes (2011) and Capps (2011) discuss the incentives under the margin and cost regulations of MHS to: evade the caps through new facility acquisitions and services manipulate costs per adjusted-admission. McCarthy (2011) reports that prices and costs were comparable to COPA Benchmark Group hospitals (based on a study by Dixon Hughes for the State) and concludes that the COPA appeared to be effective. Bovbjerg and Berenson (2015) provides an account of the MHS COPA's structure, performance, and challenges. Based on reviews of publicly available literature and data, as well as interviews with stakeholders, the report finds that the COPA had some successes. It also finds no definitive evidence about whether the COPA successfully replaced lost competition or to what extent the COPA may have affected MHS's prices, overall health costs, or quality. 41Objective Estimate the change in inpatient prices at Mission Health following the merger relative to what prices would have been but for the merger Data are not readily available to study quality effects or price effects for outpatient services or other services Difference- in-Differences model: % change Mission Health price -% change Control Group price, controlling for trend Focus on the first ten years of the merger under the COPA (1999- 2008) Recession in 2008 42Data : CMS Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) We measure price as the net inpatient revenue per discharge adjusted for case- mix index. We exclude payments for Medicare inpatients, but data are not available to exclude payments for Medicaid inpatients (Dafny, 2009). Previous research shows percent changes in this price measure yield reasonable estimates of percent changes in commercial inpatient hospital prices (Garmon, 2017). For some regressions, we add the Medicaid share of patients as an independent variable to control for variation in price per discharge due to variation in such share. Estimated price changes are not materially affected by Medicaid share, providing additional confidence in our price measurement. Data are available beginning in 1996 Pre-merger period = 1996- 1998 Post-merger period = 1999- 2008 43Control Groups We construct control groups based on pre- merger characteristics of Memorial Mission and St . Joseph's Hospitals: Staffed beds (200 beds+, 300 beds+, 400 beds+) Type of ownership (non- profit, excluding government hospitals) Average length of stay greater than 4 days Case- Mix Index ( CMI) Hospitals involved in local mergers were excluded in some c ontrol groups For comparison, we also employ the COPA Benchmark Group used by the State (cited in McCarthy , 2011, footnote 50). This group includes hospitals with 300 beds or more. It is not clear exactly how this group was chosen, but in contrast to our control groups, this group includes government -owned hospitals and hospitals involved in local mergers and also excludes some of the hospitals included in our control groups. 44Pre-merger Characteristics of Memorial Mission and St. Joseph's Hospitals 45 Pre-Merger Period = 1996- 1998 Post-Merger Period = 1999- 2008 Red Outline: coefficient estimate of merger effect is statistically significant at the 10% level or lower. 460%5%10%15%20%25%30% 200+ beds 300+ beds + 200+ beds 300+ beds 400+ beds COPA Benchmark Group Control hospitals Control hospitals not involved in local mergerDifference- in-Differences Estimates of Mission Health Post- Merger Price Changes Relative to Control GroupsMain Findings Our Difference-in -Differences analyses show that controlling for pre-merger characteristics, and local merger activity, MHS prices increased by at least 20% more than the control group prices. The estimated merger effect is statistically significant for most c ontrol groups. Relative to the COPA Benchmark Group employed by the State: the estimated merger effect is positive and similar in magnitude to the estimates based on our control groups, but not statistically significant. This may be consistent with the findings by the State that MHS was in compliance with COPA rate regulations . The evidence suggests that, despite the margin/cost regulations , the COPA oversight did not prevent MHS from raising prices. 47References Bovbjerg, R. and Berenson, R. (2015).

Natural experiment: Phoebe Putney Health's acquisition of Palmyra Medical Center Objective: Estimate price and quality change after Phoebe Putney's acquisition of Palmyra Medical Center Results: Price spiked immediately after the merger, then declined toward the control price path Most quality measures show a substantial decline in quality after the merger 55Background Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital (PPMH) and Palmyra are short-term general acute care inpatient hospitals located approximately two miles apart in Albany, Georgia Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital is technically owned by the Hospital Authority of Albany -Dougherty County and leased to Phoebe Putney Health System FTC and Georgia challenged the acquisition Alleged that post-merger Phoebe Putney would have approximately 86% market share of commercial inpatient discharges in the six -county area surrounding Albany, Georgia Acquisition of Palmyra consummated in December 2011, after the district and appellate courts ruled that Phoebe Putney had antitrust immunity due to the state- action doctrine, which allows state law to supersede federal antitrust enforcement 56Local press coverage of the acquisition announcement in https://www.walb.com/story/13723226/phoebe -putney -hospital -authority -buys -palmyra -hospital/ 57 Resolution In February 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the Georgia Hospital Authority Law did not clearly articulate a policy to displace competition and remanded the case back to the lower courts \u2014without opining on the antitrust merits of the case By this time, Phoebe had converted Palmyra into Phoebe North, which effectively precluded the divestiture of Palmyra due to Georgia Certificate of Need (CON) laws The FTC settled the case in March 2015 with a Consent Order 58Literature Review Price Studies analyzing price changes for a sample of hospital mergers: Krishnan (2001), Capps and Dranove (2004), Dafny (2009), Garmon Studies analyzing price changes for specific hospital mergers: Vita and Sacher (2001), Tenn (2011), Thompson (2011), Haas -Wilson and Garmon (2011) Quality Studies analyzing quality changes for a sample of hospital mergers: Ho and Hamilton (2000), Noether and May (2017) Study analyzing quality changes for a specific hospital merger: Romano and Balan (2011) 59Relevance of Quality Competition between hospitals involves both price and non- price dimensions Economic theory indicates that competition raises quality when prices are fixed1 Horizontal Merger Guidelines \u00a7 1:2 Enhanced market power can also be manifested in non- price terms and conditions that adversely affect customers, including reduced product quality, reduced product variety, reduced service, or diminished innovation. Such non- price effects may coexist with price effects, or can arise in their absence.

It finds the COPA offsets any upward price pressure. But quality effects unknown COPA was repealed The other 2 COPA studies yield less conclusive results because of the short pre- COPA periods and the comparison to peers with different market structures (rather than the pre- merger market structure). But the findings suggest 2 1 with COPA worse than 4 3 with COPA Regulation did not prevent post -merger quality reductions in GA 2 1 80Takeaways Studies are limited by lack of uniform, historical data on all measures 6b study might have access to better data Results hard to generalize because of variation in market structures, regulations, and implementation Does not mean we can't learn from what has been implemented It is difficult to study the range of effects that are of interest to enforcers and regulators COPA restrictions -whether effective -are often temporary Hence enforcers' preference for structural to behavioral/conduct remedies 81Gregory S.

No closures of rural facilities Maintenance or improvement of access to key services Price increases and spending in line with more competitive markets Maintenance or improvement of quality metrics Population health improvements on key metrics 106States Must Remain Vigilant Ongoing measure of effects on price, quality, and access How to resist the incentives to evade or repeal COPA oversight 20 or 30 years from now?

In the study, \"high- consolidation mergers\" are those with HHI increases of 1,115- 5,000 HHI points Existing COPAs are within this high consolidation range: Palmetto Health (SC, 1997): 2,800 Mission 5,000 Cabell Health (WV, 2018): 2,300 Conclusion: might pay to grow slower after a COPA 116Thomas Stratmann George Mason University 117Certificate of Need LawsCertificate of Need (CON) Laws Limit the ability to obtain medical treatment Have no public health or safety justificationHow Did We Get Here?
