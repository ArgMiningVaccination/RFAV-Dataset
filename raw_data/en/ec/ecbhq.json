Contour Light Therapy [Read More](18-description) Contour Light is the latest advancement in non-invasive body contouring and skin rejuvenation technology. Naturally slim, shape and tone all areas of the body safely without surgery or pain. Contour Light is effective on body areas that are resistant to diet and exercise: waist, hips, thighs, arms and chin. Unlike ultrasound, radio frequency, laser light, or freezing, LED-based therapies like the Contour Light do not cause cellular damage. Not only does the Contour Light not cause damage or pain, it has actually been shown to promote a natural healing response in the body. Contour Light is the latest advancement in light emitting diode (LED) technology and is exceptionally effective on all body areas due to its unique pad design. The wavelengths of 635nm and 880nm light are emitted by the pads of the Contour Light system, combining the beneficial aspects of both frequencies to attain optimal results. Contour Light stimulates the mitochrondria of the fat cell which generates a signal that opens the transient pores of the cell wall, resulting in a release of the contents of the cell: triglycerides, fatty acids, glycerol and water. The fat cell deflates much like a balloon that is emptied of its air volume. It is backed by an IRB-approved clinical study where patients experienced an average loss of 2.49 per session. Sessions are done 2 times per week until treatment course is completed. Each session lasts for 30 minute, followed by a 10 minute whole body vibration session. *Contour Light\u00ae is FDA-Cleared for both Body Contouring (circumference reduction), temporary pain relief from arthritis and muscle/joint pain, and locally increased blood circulation.
