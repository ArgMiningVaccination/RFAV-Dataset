Rapid review 2020. Oslo: Norwegian Ins titute of Public Health, 2020. 2 Key messages Key messages The findings in this memo are based on rapid searches in PubMed, EMBASE and two pre-print databases . One researcher went through all search records, selected and sum- marised the findings. In the current situation, there is an urgent need for identifying the most important evidence quickly. Hence, we opted for this rapid approach despite an inherent risk of overlooking key evidence or making misguided judgements. We iden tified 16 original papers from the database search and by manual searching of reference lists that were relevant to our research questions . Does primary infection wit h SARS CoV -2 result in immunity, and i f so, how long does the immunity last? We found ve ry limited evidence on imm unity after infection with SARS -CoV -2. One study on rhesus macaque monkeys suggest s that primary infection with SARS -CoV -2 may protect against reinfection. The study was small and did not provide any infor- mation on the duration of immunity. Two studies showed sustainable IgG levels one to two years after SARS -CoV infection , but it is uncertain whether this finding is general- isable to SA RS-CoV -2, and also whether sustained levels of antibodies provide full pro- tection against reinfec tion . How quickly does one develop SARS -CoV-2 specific an tibodies , and what is the proportion of pat ients presenting seroconversion ? Seroconversion rate and timing varied across studies and between IgM and IgG anti- bodies. We believe this variation is larg ely is due to differences in the test sensitivity . A problem that probably will dissolve when larger studies using validated tests are pub- lished . Does the rate of seroconversion and/ or the timing depen d on the severity of SARS -CoV-2 infection? Seroconvers ion rate and timing do not appear to differ between patients with mild to severe/critical COVID 19 infection. Studies of asymptomatic cases are however lacking. Can antibodies be transmitted from women infected with SARS -CoV-2 to the fetus via pla- centa an d thus confer immunity in the newborn? Results from one small study suggest that antibodies from SARS -CoV -2 infected women may be transmitted to the foetus during pregnancy , but the evidence is uncertain. 3 Hovedfunn at vi kan ha oversett studien var fra SARS men dokumenta sjonen er u sikker. 4 Content Content KEY MESSAGES 2 HOVEDFUNN (NORWEGIAN ) 3 CONTE NT 4 INTRODUCTION 5 METHODS 6 RESULTS 7 Summary of included primary studies 7 Characteristics of included studies 7 Results 11 DISCUSSION AND CONCL USION 13 REFERENCES 15 ATTACHMENT 17 5 Introduction In relation to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's role in handling the C OVID -19 epidemic, we have been asked to prepare a rapid summary of the available research on immunity after SARS -CoV -2 infection. The novel corona -virus S ARS -CoV -2 that causes the disease COVID -19, bears the trans- membrane glycoprotein spikes (S protein), which are typical for this type of viruses. The spikes are important targets for the human immune response, and in particular the receptor -binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (1).The spikes enables the virus to en- ter the host cells through the human receptor angiote nsin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Individuals who are infected wit h SARS -CoV -2 typically start produc ing virus specific antibodies (IgM, IgG, and IgA) that cover the spikes and neutralis es the virus (1).This process may be associated with some level of immunity and protection against reinfec- tion, for some period o f time (2). Seroconversion is the transitio n from a seronegative condition; where no antibodies are in the serum, or they are present bu t below the limit of detection, to a serop ositive condition, in which antibodies can be detected in se- rum samples . Detection of SARS -CoV -2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies has recently been made possi- ble through the development of new tests e.g. ELISA kits (2), thus allowing the study of seroconversion rate and seroconversion timing in patients with COVID -19. 6 Methods The main objective of this rapid review was to summarise current evidence concerning immunity after SARS -CoV -2 infection. More specifically we wanted to address the fol- low research questions: Main question: Does one become immune after infection with SARS -CoV -2? If so how long does the immunity last? How quickly does one develop SARS -CoV -2 specific antib odies (seroconversion timing)? What is the proportion of people who develop these antibodies (seroconversion rate)? Does the seroconversion rate and/or timing depend on the severity of infection ? Can mothers infected with SARS -CoV -2 transmit antibodies to the fetus via pla- centa and thus confer immunity in the newborn? We car ried out searches in PubMed, EMBASE, and in two pre -print database s (BioRxiv, MedRxiv). Searches were limited to the period from 2019 to 31 March 2020 , as the novel SARS -CoV -2 virus em erged in late 2019 (3). We selected studies focus ing on (i) immunity after SARS CoV 2 infection; (ii) serocon- version rate after SARS -CoV -2 infection (iii) seroconversion timing after symptom on- set, (iv) severity of disease and seroconversion and (v) transmission of antibodies from infected mothers to the foetus during pregnancy. One researcher (Gerd Flodgren ) assessed the relevance of each reference and summa- rized the findings. Three Meyer N\u00e6ss , Norwegian Institute Public Health, ) read and provided feedback on drafts of the review before publication . Kjetil Brurberg wrote the Norwegian summary. Elisabet Hafstad (Information Specialist) prepared the literature searches 7 Result s The search resulted in 439 unique records, and we ended up including 16 primary studies . Nine of these were publish ed in peer reviewed journals, and seven studies were unpublished pre-prints . As expected, n o systematic review on immunity after SARS -Cov-2 infection was identified. Thirteen stud ies wer e conducted in China, one in Finland, Taiwan and Australia respectively . Summary of included primary studies Five cohort and four retrospective studies (4-12), and three case studies (13-15) re- ported on seroconversion rate and/or seroconversion timing after SARS -CoV -2 infec- tion (see T able 1 ). Two of these studies also provided some information on the associa- tion between seroconversion rate and severity of COVID -19 disease (5, 9) . One retro- spective study reported on transmission of antibodies from mother to foetus during pregnancy (16) . One prospective study of rhesus macaque monkeys reported on pro- tection against reinfection after primary SARS -CoV -2 infection in animal model (17) . Two cohort studies evaluat ed the antibody levels after SARS -CoV infection , a virus with similarities to SARS - CoV -2 (18, 19) . Characteristics of included s tudies Studies of immunity after SARS -CoV -2 infection We did not identify any human studies that could help answer ing whether people who have been infected with SARS -CoV -2 once, will be fully or partially protected from fu- ture re-infection by the same virus , and if so for how long. We found one relevant but unpublished study (pre -print) . The study used an animal model including six adult rhe- sus macaque monkeys to investigate whether primary SARS -CoV -2 infection could have a protective effect against reinfect ion (17) . We also found two studies that evaluated antibody levels after SARS -CoV infection (18, 19) . One study by Guo et al. of healthcare workers (n=34 ) previously infected with SARS -CoV who's antibody levels were fol- lowed up for 13 years after the primary infection (19) . A second study by Wu et al in- clud ing 173 patients , who 's antibody levels were followed up for three years after SARS -CoV infection (18) . Even if these two latter studies do not study S ARS -CoV -2 per 8 se, we judged that they might be of interest since SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV -2 have many similarities (1), and both viruses use the ACE2 receptor to enter the cell (20) . Studies of seroconversion rate and timing after SARS -CoV -2 infection Nine studies (4-12) assessed the seroconversion timing and/or seroconversion rate in patients with SARS -CoV -2 infection. The sample size s ranged from 22 to 173 patients (median sample size: 34), and median age ran ged from 40 to 6 7 years. Four of the smaller studies included more men than women, while the large study by Zhao and col- leagues (6), and most other studies, included a similar proportion of males and females. Four studies did not report the severity of disease of included patients (4, 7, 8, 11) , while the remaining studies reported a mix of mild to severe or critically ill cases . Non - symptomatic patients were not included in any of the studies. See Table 1 for details on the severity of included patients. In one study 46% of included patients were reported to have chronical illnesses (5). The number of serum samples analysed ranged from 29 to 535 across studies. The se- rological tests used in the included studies were as follows: EIA (5), CLIA (7), ELISA (6), proteomic microarrays (8), GICA (12) , SARS -CoV -2 antibody kit (9), ICG strip assay (11) . Two stud ies used three different serological test : CLIA, ELISA, and GICA (4), and ELISA, LFTA, and CMIA (10) . For the full names of the tests see Table 1 footnotes . Three case studies (13-15) also evaluated seroconversion timing in patients with SARS - CoV -2 infection. The three cases were all female, between 30 and 47 years old, and pre- senting with mild to moderate symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection. The number of ana- lysed samples ranged f rom 4 to 7 across studies, and t hree different analysis methods were used for the analyses (see Table 1). Studies of antibody transmission during pregnan cy and SARS -CoV -2 infection Zheng and colleagues reported a study of antibody transmission during preg nancy . An- tibodies (IgM and IgG) in serum were assessed post -partum with a CLIA kit in six women with confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection and their six infants. A ll infants were de- livered by C -section, and mothers and personnel were all wearing protective masks during delivery . All six infants were isolated directly after delivery. 9 Table 1 Characteristics of included studies that reported on seroconversion rate and timing after SARS -CoV -2 infection (N=12) Author Year No of patients with COVID -19: age; gender Severity of disease \u00a7 Test for de- tection of SARS -CoV-2 specific anti- bodies No of serum sam- ples of sampling IgM IgG Publication type/ Jour- nal/Impact factor (IF) Gao 2020 Retrospective N=22 Median age: 40 years (4 -73) F:8; M:14 Not reported (most patients received oxy- gen erapy and anti -viral medication ) CLIA, ELISA, GICA * *Considered positive if of the tests was positive3 N=37* 1-7: n= 10 Chinese Medical Journal/ IF: 1.053 in 2014 Jiang 2020 Cohort study China N=29 (and 29 controls) Mean age: 42.3 (SD 13.8) F:16; M:13 3 mild 26 'com- mon' cases Proteome microarrays N=29 Collected mean 22 days Seroconversion : 100% Seroconversion rate : 100% MedRxiv pre N=34 (IQR:31 68 F:63; M:70 44 moderate cases; 52 l cases SARS -CoV- 2antibody de- tection kit Not reported Seroconversion disease : Moderate:79.55% Severe: 82.69% Critical:72.97% Seroconversion Critical: 97.30% MedRxiv pre N=80 cases and N=300 controls Median age: 55 (45-64) 65 non -critical cases Median seroconversion time:12 d Pan 2020 Retrospective China N=67 No information ICG strip assay N=86 1 (78 pat.) 2 (25 pat.)

The study included only four monkeys , and since there was no time gap between the time of re- covery from the primary infection and the point in time when the monkeys were re - challenged with t he virus, this study provide no insight into the duration of the poten- tial immunity. Results from the study by Guo et al. of healthcare workers previously infected with SARS -CoV, showed sustained IgG levels one year after infection, but persisting levels up to 13 years after infection. (19) . Results presented by Wu and colleagues suggest that IgG levels after SARS -CoV infection may be maintained for up to two years after infec- tion, but that IgG levels are seen to decrease during the third year (18) . Seroconversion rate after SARS -CoV -2 infection Seroconversion rate varied across studies , antibodies, and stage of Covid -19 disease . In three studies (4, 10, 11) that repo rted seroconversion rate for IgM and IgG at different stages of the disease the rate ranged between 11.1% -60% and 3.6% -50% at the early stage (d 1 - 7 after symptom onset ), between 53.8% -86.7 % and 57 .1%-76.9 % at inter- mediate stage (d8 -14), and between 74.2%-96.7 % and 93.3 -100% at late stage for IgM and IgG respectively. For four studies that repor ted seroconversion rate at only one point in time it ranged from 50% to 100% for IgM, and from 64.7% to 100% for IgG (5, 6, 8, 12) . For details on the seroconversion rate in individual studies see table 1. Seroconversion timing after SARS -CoV -2 infection Seroconversion timing for IgM and IgG varied across studies and antibody class . Pro- duction of virus specific antibodies a fter infection were detected at an early stage after symptom onset in some cases , and in other cases at the intermediate or late stage . In two studies the seroconversion timing was reported to be shorter for I gM than for IgG (6, 10) , while results from two other studies suggest earlier timing for IgG than for IgM (5, 15) . Two studies reported median seroconversion timing ranging from 10 -12 days for IgM and between 12 and 14 days for IgG (6, 10) . In the three case studies serocon- version timing for IgM was reported to be 9 days after symptom onset in two studies (13, 15) , and between 7 to 9 days for IgG in three studies (13-15). For details on the se- roconversion timing for IgM and IgG see Table 1. Seroconversion and severity of disease One study reported no correlation between serum levels of IgM and Ig G antibodies and severity of disease, but reported some evidence for a faster peak in antibody response 12 in people with COVID 19 disease who later died, than in those who recovered (5). One study reported no differe nces in seroconversion rate (or concentration) of I gM and IgG antibodies between groups of patients with different severity of disease (9). Antibody transmission during pregnancy Zheng and colleagues reported that all six infants delivered by SARS -CoV -2 infected mothers had increased levels of antibodies (five had increased IgG levels, two had in- creased IgM levels), and that none of the infan ts tested positive for SARS -CoV -2. All mothers also had increased levels of antibodies (16) . 13 Discussion and conclusion We i ncluded 16 original studies in this rapid review of research related to immunity a f- ter S ARS -CoV -2 infection . Nine of these studies were published in international peer re- viewed journals , while six were unpublished pre -prints that had not been subjected to peer review. Thirteen studies were conducted in China, and one study was from Fin- land, one from Taiwan and one from Australia. The latter three were case -studies. Immunity and protection against reinfection We did not identify any human studies directly addressing whether infection with SARS - CoV -2 results in immunity and protection against re-infection. Results from a study on rhesus macaqu e monkeys suggest protection against reinfection after primary infection, but the study was small and did not provide any information on the potential duration of immunity. Results from two studies of anti body levels after infection with SARS -CoV, a similar corona virus , suggest that high levels of IgG may last for up to 1 -2 years after infection (18, 19) . However, due to the recent identification of the SARS - CoV -2 virus , there are no studies available that can confirm or refute whether this is the case also for SARS -CoV -2. Even if it is likely that sustained levels of antibodies are re- lated to some level of protection a gainst reinfection , we do not at present know i f they ensure full protect ion against reinfection by the same virus or may result in less severe infection at future exposure to the virus . Production of disease specific antibodies - seroconversion rate and timing After infection IgM antibodies appear first and thereafter IgG (2). Further, that IgM lev- els are higher at early stages of disease and then decreases over time , while IgG levels increases during the intermediate and later stage after symptom onset (2).The r esults from this rapid review however were mixed, with some studies reporting e arlier sero- conversion for IgM , others for IgG , and yet oth er studies suggest ing similar seroconver- sion time for both antibodies. One explanation to this may be due to different test sensi- tivity to the dif ferent antibodies for the, sometimes non -validated, serological tests used in the included studies. One study reported differences in detection rate of anti- bodies across the three (validated) tests used in the study (CLIA, GICA and ELISA), with GICA exhibiting higher positive rate in serum IgM detection, while ELISA had compara- tively higher rates in serum IgG dete ction (4). Difference in the proportion of patients who presented seroconversion also differed across studies and antibodies. We believe 14 that the seroconversion rate will be high er and more coherent with mor e studies using validated tests , better study designs, and larger sample sizes being conducted. Severity of disease and seroconversion Few studies assessed whether seroconversion rate was associated with the severity of disease in patients (5, 9) . Results from t wo studies, in which t he sever ity of disease ranged from mild to severe or critical, suggest no correlation between severity of ill- ness and seroconversion rate. One of the studies suggest a possible associa tion be- tween a fast early peak in serum antibodies after symptom onset and risk of death (5), but otherwise little information was provided . No study included asymptomatic non - hospitalised cases, and little is ther efore known regarding whether or not seroconver- sion occur in these subjects , and if so, when . Transmission of antibodies during pregnancy Only one small retrospective study including 6 women and their babies supports trans- mission of protective antibodies from women with mild SARS -CoV -2 infection to the foetus through the umbilical cord. All infants , and their mothers , had incre ased levels of antibodies. N one of the new -borns tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 (16) . This study was limited by the lack of follow up of the infants after birth. One retrospective study that included nine women with non -severe COVID -19 disease also reported that all new -borns who were tested (N=6 ) were negative for SARS -CoV -2 in analyses of amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal th roat swab and breast milk (21) . Another retrospec tive study, which included 28 women with mild to severe COVID -19 disease and their offspring, reported that 3.6% (1/28) of the infants tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 after birth (22) . In this study cord and placental sa mples were negative to SARS -CoV -2, which may indicate that this was not a vertically transmitted infec tion, but may be a false positive. The infant's symptoms were resolved in 2 days ' time. None of the latter studies however assessed the IgM or IgG levels . In conclusion, we identif ied 16 studies, of which a majority were from China, and many that were unpublished pre -prints . It is still early days, and answering the question re- garding immunity after primary infection must await well -conducted studies with larger sample sizes, using validated methods . A large number of a ntibody test s have been made available after the SA RS-CoV -2 outbreak in China in December 19 , but many of these need further validation. 15 References 1.
