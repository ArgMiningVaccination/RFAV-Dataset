For fibroids that are larger or more bothersome, prescription medications can help shrink fibroids and reduce associated symptoms like heavy bleeding. In some cases, when lifestyle changes, medications, and alternative therapies are not effective for symptom relief, your healthcare provider may recommend a specialist procedure to destroy fibroids and significantly prevent their return. This article discusses the various treatment options available to shrink fibroids, relieve fibroid pain, and reduce the risk of new fibroids growing. Language Considerations The words \"female\" and \"women\" are used here to refer to people who identify as women and have typical reproductive organs of a cisgender female. We recognize that some people who identify as women do not have the same anatomy as that depicted in this article. Verywell / Jessica Olah How to Shrink Fibroids Naturally Many women with fibroids turn to home remedies and lifestyle changes to alleviate fibroid symptoms, slow fibroid growth, and reduce the risk of developing more fibroids. Diet Diet alone is unlikely to shrink fibroids, especially if they are not already shrinking on their own. However, certain foods, such as those that are high in trans fats, may trigger inflammation in your body, which is thought to contribute to fibroid growth. Research also suggests that a diet low in fruits and vegetables can increase your risk of developing fibroids. Eating certain foods may help prevent or slow fibroid growth, including: Fruits and vegetables, particularly leafy greens, citrus fruits, and potassium-rich fruits, such as avocado and bananasLean meats (such as chicken) Legumes (including beans, peas, and lentils)Fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel) Green tea Eating red meat, consuming alcohol, and having vitamin D deficiency are all associated with fibroid development. One study found that women deficient in vitamin D had the largest fibroids. Adding fortified foods rich in vitamin D to your diet\u2014like cereal and milk, mushrooms, eggs, and nuts\u2014may protect against fibroid development and growth. Vitamins and Supplements for Shrinking Fibroids Research shows that taking vitamin D3 supplements is safe and effective for reducing the risk of fibroids. Although more research is needed, a handful of other vitamins have been identified for their potential to slow fibroid growth, including vitamins A, B3, C, E, and K. Before adding a supplement to your routine, discuss your options with a healthcare provider. Natural Alternative Treatments for Uterine Fibroids Exercise Exercise won't do much to reduce the size of any existing fibroids, but studies show that regular physical activity may help maintain a healthy hormonal balance in women and prevent fibroid development. Exercise releases endorphins (feel-good hormones) that may help reduce fibroid-related pain. Eating a nutritious, balanced diet and getting regular physical activity may help improve fibroid symptoms, but there is no evidence to suggest that they can shrink fibroids. If your fibroids are impacting your daily life, your healthcare provider may suggest prescription medications and/or medical procedures to shrink or remove the fibroids. Herbal Remedies A compound in green tea called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is proven to stop the growth and development of fibroids with minimal side effects. For fibroids, researchers recommend using green tea extract that contains 45% EGCG. Other plant remedies that are believed alataus)Strawberries You can benefit from these herbal remedies by including them in your cooking, using them to make teas, or taking them in extract form. However, do keep in mind that just because an herb is natural, doesn't mean there is no chance of side effects or drug interactions. For example, you should not use turmeric if you are taking blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or aspirin. Turmeric can strengthen the blood-thinning effect of the medications, which may increase your risk of bleeding. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that involves inserting thin, tiny needles into specific points on the body to relieve symptoms of certain health conditions. Acupuncture won't cure fibroids, but research shows it can help reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and chronic pelvic pain. A small 2019 study found that a specific form of acupuncture called Tung's 7-point acupuncture protocol may help reduce fibroid symptoms. Nine out of the 14 study participants experienced complete elimination of all fibroid symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment, with no adverse side effects. Larger studies are needed to confirm the study's findings. Medications to Shrink Fibroids Prescription medications such as hormonal birth control can help treat fibroid symptoms, but they do not shrink fibroids. Over-the-counter pain relievers (such as Advil and Tylenol) may help reduce pain. Mifeprex (mifepristone) The hormone progesterone is associated with the growth of uterine fibroids. Mifeprex (mifepristone) is a drug that blocks progesterone. This medication has been shown to effectively treat fibroids; it can both shrink existing fibroids and reduce associated symptoms, including prolonged menstrual periods, heavy bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure, menstrual cramps, and anemia. In the U.S., mifepristone is not yet approved for treating fibroids. It is currently approved for use in medical abortion and for treating Cushing's syndrome (under the brand name Korlym). GnRH Agonists Gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are a type of medication that inhibit the production of estrogen and progesterone, essentially putting your body into temporary menopause to help shrink fibroids. GnRH agonists effectively shrink fibroids, but they can cause serious side effects, including decreased bone mineral density. What Does a T-Score Mean for Your Bone Health? GnRH agonists are often prescribed on a short-term basis due to the potentially harmful side effects. There is also a risk that the fibroids will grow back once you stop taking the medication. For these reasons, GnRH agonists are often prescribed for women who are awaiting surgery for fibroid removal. Surgeries and Specialist-Driven Procedures Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) is the most effective way to eliminate fibroids. But if you want to have more children or prefer to keep your womb, there are other procedures to shrink or remove fibroids. MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (FUS) Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery, also known as focused ultrasound surgery (FUS), uses ultrasonic pulses to heat up and destroy fibroid tissues. This minimally-invasive procedure is associated with a reduction in fibroid size, improved symptoms, and better quality of life in women who have undergone the procedure. Uterine Artery Embolization Uterine artery embolization (UAE), also known as uterine fibroid embolization, is a minimally invasive procedure that may reduce fibroid symptoms. Using a flexible tube (catheter), your healthcare provider will inject small particles (called embolic agents) into the arteries to block blood supply to fibroids. This causes the fibroids to shrink or die. Uterine artery embolization has a high success rate. Over 91% of women report a reduction in symptoms following UAE, including heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, and pelvic pain. In a 2021 study, investigators observed a 73% reduction in fibroids one year after the procedure. How Long Does It Take for Fibroids to Shrink After Embolization? It usually takes about three months for fibroids to shrink after embolization. After that, fibroids will continue to shrink for six to nine months or more. Bleeding may occur when fibroids shrink both after surgical and nonsurgical interventions to treat fibroids. A fibroid breaking down (degenerating) may cause severe Laparoscopic Radiofrequency Ablation Laparoscope radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a procedure that uses heat to destroy fibroid tissue and significantly reduce its size. Small incisions are made in the abdomen so your healthcare provider can access the fibroids and protect the surrounding healthy tissues (e.g., ovaries, uterus). Most women can expect relief from fibroid symptoms within three to six months following the procedure. A 2019 review of studies on RFA found that on average, fibroid volume decreased by 66% a year after the procedure. What Should I Know About Fibroids Surgery? Fibroids and Hormonal Changes The sex hormones estrogen and progesterone play a role in the development and growth of fibroids. Hormonal shifts caused by pregnancy and menopause may have an impact on how fibroids grow or shrink. Pregnancy Estrogen levels rise significantly during pregnancy. As a result, fibroids may grow or develop during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. However, fibroids often shrink after giving birth. Research shows that 70% of women who were pregnant and gave birth experienced a more than 50% reduction in fibroid size. Menopause During menopause, the body produces less estrogen and progesterone. The drop in hormone levels reduces the risk of developing fibroids and may help pre-existing fibroids shrink. If you are close to the age in which menopause typically starts (between 45 and 55 years old), you may want to consider \"watchful waiting\" before opting for any fibroid treatments. Watchful waiting is an approach that involves regular pelvic exams and symptom tracking to monitor fibroids. This approach is often recommended for women who have mild fibroid symptoms that can be managed through nonmedical approaches or are nearing menopause. How to Manage Hormone Fluctuations Summary Fibroids are noncancerous growths that commonly develop in a woman's uterus during her childbearing years. Fibroids don't always cause symptoms, but larger fibroids may cause pain and discomfort that affect your quality of life. A healthy diet may prevent fibroid development and growth, but it is not known to shrink fibroids. Some home remedies may help manage fibroid symptoms but are not a cure. Prescription medications, surgeries, and specialist-driven procedures such as uterine fibroid embolization may effectively shrink fibroids. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best method to shrink fibroids and alleviate symptoms. 20 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
