MD (Ay) & Dr Manasa, B.A.M.S Bronchi are the tubes of your respiratory system which carry air to and from your lungs. Bronchitis is an inflammation of your bronchial tubes. It can be either acute or chronic. It is a very common condition which develops following cold or other respiratory infections. Acute bronchitis improves in quick time, often within 7-10 days although the cough may persist longer. It is also called as chest cold. Chronic bronchitis is more serious compared to its acute counterpart. In this there is constant inflammation or irritation of the lining of bronchial tubes. This is often caused in smokers. The patient may have repeated bouts of bronchitis and needs medical attention. This condition is included in COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

Kasa and Svasa comprise almost all symptoms explained in Bronchitis. Since acute bronchitis is related to cold, it can also be understood on the lines of pratishyaya. Therefore from an Ayurveda lens Bronchitis can be comparatively studied with - - Kasa - Svasa - Pratisyaya - Fever Ayurveda treatment for bronchitis too shall be given on the basis of the principles of treatment, effective formulations and dietetic recommendations made in the above said contexts.

Read - [Ayurvedic Home Remedy For Cough Due To Pitta Increase](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/12/19/ayurvedic-home-remedy-cough-due-pitta-increase/) Kasa as Bronchitis Exposure to smoke, dust etc are mentioned among the causative factors of kasa. Irritation, feeling of foreign substances and itching in the throat (hoarseness) are mentioned among the premonitory symptoms of kasa. Sore throat is associated with acute bronchitis and may appear earlier than other symptoms. Cough with expectoration of phlegm is the chief complaint of kapha type of kasa. Cough and expectoration are predominant in bronchitis too. Cold, thick and white colored phlegm, excessive phlegm and feeling of heaviness / discomfort of chest are predominant. Kaphaja kasa can be closely correlated with chronic bronchitis though pittaja and vataja types cannot be ruled out. When pitta is predominant, there is yellow colored expectoration, hoarseness of voice, excessive feel of heat and fumes in the chest indicative of active inflammation, fever and continuous cough. When vata is predominant in kasa, there is excessive pain in the head and sides of the chest, [hoarseness of voice](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/08/10/hoarse-voice-causes-ayurvedic-treatment-home-remedies/), dryness of mouth and throat (irritation), weakness, dry cough and less expectoration of stubborn phlegm with difficulty. So, bronchitis may present with clinical picture of kapha, pitta or vata predominance or all together. Putting Kasa in the language of bronchitis: - Kapha type of bronchitis - with expectoration of plenty of phlegm / mucus easily done, chest discomfort and heaviness. This is typically of chronic type. When cough and expectoration of phlegm is associated with cold it is of acute type. - Pitta type of bronchitis - inflammation of the bronchi is more than in kapha, the condition may be associated with other inflammatory / pittaja conditions like hyperacidity, reflex esophagitis etc, phlegm is of green color. In acute cases fever is associated. - Vata type of bronchitis - there is excessive dryness of the respiratory passages, less phlegm, difficult expectoration after constant coughing; bouts of cough are more and are associated with pain in the chest and throat with hoarseness of throat. This is usually a chronic picture. Read - [Charaka Kasa Chikitsa svasa resembles bronchitis clinical picture. Looking at the pathogenesis of tamaka svasa explained in Ayurveda (Cha.Chi.21), the disease is manifested due to the retrograde / abnormal movement of vayu. This vayu when occupies channels of the body in the chest, neck and head, it shuffles the kapha therein and vitiates it. Along with kapha, this vata produces rhinitis / cold. The blocks produced by these doshas causes wheezing sounds in the chest. In the later stages the person coughs continuously and feeling tired due to that he faints. He feels comfortable once the mucus has been removed or expelled. There is also suppression of voice and loss of sleep and pain in chest and sides of chest. Here we can see that the initial stages of manifestation of the disease resemble the clinical picture of acute bronchitis. As the disease progresses, in the later stages, it resembles chronic bronchitis. Though tamaka svasa has been compared to asthma, its presentation is also close enough to bronchitis. Even the treatment strategies explained in svasa when administered in bronchitis yield good results.
