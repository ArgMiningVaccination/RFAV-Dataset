CONCLUSION 3 INTRODUCTION Respondent James Feijo is overseer of Respondent Daniel Chapter One (DCO), a Christian ministry organized as a Washington State Corporation Sole devoted to body, mind and spirit health. Contrary to Complaint Counsel's assertion, Respondents have . controverted every point in Complaint Counsels' case. Respondents deny that they claimed that their products were effective in preventing, treating, or curing cancer. They deny that they sell products. They deny that they advertise. They deny that the FTC had legal jurisdiction over their non-profit religious activities. They deny that they lacked competent and reliable scientific evidence to support the statements they made about their product. They deny that their activities are substantially, if at all, in commerce. And they deny that their actions violated Sections 5 and 12 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In fact, Complaint Counsel has failed to present evidence on key elements of their case. They have provided no expert testimony on either the proper scientific evidence to support statements or claims about the effects of herbs or the standard that should be applied to evidence that supports statements about the effects of herbs. Nor have they provided any expert testimony on how the net impression of the set of statements made by Respondents should be determined, relying instead on the \"common sense\" ofthe person responsible for the Internet surfthat identified 130 organizations as violating FTC laws without distinguishing among any of them. Complait Counsel have failed to present persuasive evidence that Respondents made the alleged clais and lacked adequate substatiation. For these reasons Complaint Counel's motion for sumar decision on its behalf should be denied. Indeed the failure of Complait 4 Counsel to provide any evidence on herbal science, or the factu status of \"net impression\" in ths case, as spelled out in Respondents' Motion for Sumar Decision should cause Respondents' Motion for Sumar Decision to be granted. i. STATEMENT OF FACTS A. DCO and the Feijos Have Not Advertised or Sold Products to Consumers In 1986, James Feijo and his wife Patricia started DCO as a nonprofit ministry which among its projects began a small health food store. Ex. 1. At this time the Feijos were engaged in home church missionary work in Communst countries including Poland, East Germany and China. They took Bibles to Christian communities that met in homes of their members as par of their \"home church\" missionar work. As a result of the missionary travels, the Feijos were in East Germany when the Berlin wall fell on November 9, 1989 and in Tiananen Square during the sumer Democracy protests of 1989. In 2002, James Feijo organized DCO as a corporation sole under Washington state laws. Ex. 1. DCO curently offers consumers 150 to 200 products. Ex. i. James Feijo serves as DCO's Overseer, trustee for all DCO assets, and custodian ofDCO's financial records. Ex. 1. Patricia Feijo is DCO's Secretary. Ex. 1. James Feijo was a high school science teacher and coach, including fitness coach, to high school students and amateur and professional athletes. Patricia Feijo is a trained Homeopath and worked for several years as a bench technician as par of a team doing cancer research on animals at a major 5 Worcester research center, working in conjunction with a major Worcester Hospital using the experimental chemotherapy on people. Respondents' principal offce and place of business is located in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where the Feijos live. Ex. 1. Messiah Y'Shua Shalom, a second Washington Corporation Sole established by James Feijo, owns two Rhode Island buildings that house an Order Center, offices and a house (neither DCO nor Messiah Y'Shua Shalom owns a warehouse) used by DCO as offices and a residence. Ex. 1. DCO also owns a three- bedroom property in Deerfield Beach, Florida, where the Feijos and other individuals who are part of the DCO community and guests stay. DCO also owns two Cadillac cars-one used and one bought at a last-year's model sale-which together cost DCO $56,000 or an average of$28,000 each-which the Feijos and other persons associated with DCO use. Ex. 1. DCO pays the Feijos' expenses but does not pay them salaries. Ex. 1. DCO has never purchased, bartered or otherwise arranged for an advertisement of the herbs or other products it provides to its followers. All its communications are on its web site, in its rarely published news letters and handbooks which it provides for free or small donations, or on its daily radio program which are all directed to individuals who are part of the DCO audience and which are outspokenly clear that they are not selling drugs but rather providing a critique of curent health practices, a campaign for \"health freedom\" and complementary and alternative approaches to conventional attitudes about wellness- including products-as a concrete expression of their campaign for more health choice. The program for well being pursued by Danel Chapter One is grounded in the Bible. 6 B. Daniel Chapter One Maintains A Non Profit Charitable Program That Allows Any User OfDCO Products To Obtain Free DCO Products And Accepts Donations From Other DCO Product Users At its origination Daniel Chapter One offered free products to any individual who wanted them. When this tued out to be an unmanageable program DCO created a new program that informed individuals who desired and needed free nutritional products to go a church and seek the support of a minister who could inform DCO of the need and desire. The minister would then act as a reference for the individual to Daniel Chapter One. As a result ofthis effort a number of churches have received herbal and nutritional products for distribution to individuals both for free and for donations from the individuals able to make donations and also have shared in the monetary donations made for the herbal and nutritional products provided by DCO. 1. The Feijos Developed The Formulas For The DCO Products And Contracted With FDA Regulated Laboratories To Ensure The Quality Of Those Products And The Accuracy And Legality Of The Product Labels. As a coach, including fitness coaching, James Feijo observed the relationship between various nutritional products, herbs and other dietary supplements and athletic performance. He also noted, as a devout Christian, that a number of Bible verses created dietary information that paralleled his observations of the athletes he coached. For example, Daniel Chapter One in the Bible tells the story of a group of individuals who resisted eating the King's prescribed diet. They talked the authorities into letting them eat a special, and they thought healthier, diet than that prescribed by the King's governent. 7 While eating this diet, which was essentially vegetarian, the Bible reports they indeed did have improved heath over the King's men. Based on his readings of the Bible and his observations of the athletes he coached James Feijo developed, created, and arranged for the production of various DCO Products. Ex. 1. He contracted with various FDA regulated manufacturing facilities for them to ensure the safety of the products, the quality and proper amounts of ingredients to meet the dosage requirement of his formulations, and the accuracy and legal compliance of the labels on the products and to ensure that the identity and amount of each ingredient is contained on the product labels. Ex. 1. The companies provided the services to ensure that the dietary supplements met quality and labeling requirements. Universal Nutrition, a respected regulated manufacturer of dietary supplement products, is one firm that DCO contracts with to manufacture approximately 35-40 products, including Bio*Shark, GDU, and BioMixx. Ex. 1 The tea like drink 7 Herb Formula, the fourth product singled out by the FTC, is manufactured and provided to DCO in the same maner by a different company after the formulation was developed, based on a well known previously existing product, by that company's herbal consultant. Ex. 2. Patricia Feijo, drawing on her research technician background and training as a homeopath, reviewed all DCO products' directions, recommended usages and statements made about the DCO products for the express purpose of ensuring that they contained no health claims, that they properly stated the structure and fuction nature of the product effects and that no statements were made for the products which were not substantiated in 8 the scientific literature that supports the use of dietar supplements that are herbs and nutritional products. Ex. 1. 2. Respondents Do Not Sell Products To Consumers From time to time James Feijo establishes a recommended donation amount for the DCO products. However he does not \"price\" to the market as a for profit business would but rather leaves the recommended donations in place long after the market prices on similar products sold by for profit businesses have been raised by their sellers. Ex. 1. The fact that about a thousand consumers have purchased DCO's products supports the assertion of Respondents that DCO, which has been in existence for 24 years, is something other than a business. Ex. 1. DCO generates approximately $2 million in anual sales annually as shown by its records for 2006,2007, and 2008. Ex. 1. This too suggests that it is something other than a business, since the products it makes available are dietary supplements which are par of a market that sell about $24 bilion worth of product a year. Daniel Chapter one is not organized or ru to make, and does not make, a profit. The recommended donation for DCO products is comparable to or lower than similar dietary supplement product prices for products available in the for profit dietary supplement market. If individuals are unable to make the recommended donation they can make a lower donation or no donation at all by contacting a minister who wil inform DCO of their needs. During its twenty four years of activity DCO has received virtally no complaints, about quality, value, or natue of the information supplied. During the same 9 time it has received dozens if not hundreds of testimonials to the value and usefulness of both the DCO products and its various informational programs. The testimonials received both in writing and on a daily basis from listeners to their radio program underscore the existence of a community of individuals involved with the message of \"health freedom\" and \"health choice\" that is the backbone of the DCO health ministry. The testimonials tend to be spontaneous and hear felt. For example ,one user of DCO products and believer in the DCO message created the 7Herb Formula web site and donated it to the DCO ministry. The message that DCO is sharg with the individuals in its communty create what the Supreme Cour calls an Expressive Association. 3. The DCO Products a. Bio*Shark As a very successful high school athletic coach, Jim Feijo designed a computer program to track his athletes. He expanded to internationally competitive amateur athletes and then to professionals. He noted that the stress on an extreme athlete created nutritional and physiological effects similar to those experienced by diseased individuals. This led him to design a program for extreme athletes and il individuals to strengthen the natural structures and fuctions for the body that build endurance, strength, balance and the ability to withstand disease. He applied the term \"BioMolecular Nutritional Health\" to the integrated ideas based on his experience and built into his program measured nutritional factors in relation to the structure and fuction of the body. He used these ideas to design the products that 10 he had made especially for DCO. Thus he formulated Bio*Shark out of shark cartilage and several herbs. Ex. 1. Each Bio*Shark label directs users to tae 2-3 capsules thee ties a day or as directed by a physician or by a \"BioMolecular Nutrtion health care professional.\" Ex. 1. BioMolecular nutrtion also includes and draws on the intangible-spirtul-components of performance, integrating \"the spirtu and physical\" aspects of Respondents' system and products. Expert report and deposition of Jay Lehr who is a scientific expert, a trathon racer and a user of DCO products. Ex. 1. Respondents recommend a donation for one bottle ofBio*Shark, as they do for all their products, that is an amount comparable to the price paid for simlar products in the dieta supplement industr. Ex. 1. Respondents estiate that approxiately 50% of the mark up on all their products goes to support churches and the five health food stores and health professional offces that have asked to car DCO products and the support of the DCO free and reduced donation programs. Respondents' expert Dr. Lamont concluded that \"There is a reasonable basis for the claims that pure skeletal tissue of sharks provides a protein that inhbits angiogenesis - the formation of new blood vessels. It is also reasonable to claim that angiogenesis has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in some studies.\" Ex. 3. b. 7 Herb Formula 7 Herb Formula is atea made of four herbs that have been used for decades in herbal healing with thee additional herbs added by DCO after review and evaluation by an herbal professional in conjunction with an herbal manufactuer. Ex. 2. Both Respondents' herbal experts Dr. Duke and Dr. Lamont concluded \"There is a reasonable basis for the clais that the ingredients of7 Herb Formula' ..., fights tuor formation, and fights pathogenic bacteria. '\" 11 Ex. 4 and Ex. 3. c. GDU \"There is a reasonable basis for the clais that the ingredients of GDU 'contains natual proteolytic enzes (from pineapple source bromelai) to help digest protein- even that of unwanted tuors and cysts. Ths formula also helps to relieve pai and heal inamation. . GDU is also used for. . .and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. GDU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inamatory and antispasmodic .. '\" E 4 activity. . . x. \"There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of GDU contain bromelain, a source of natural proteolytic enzymes from the pineapple, which helps digest unwanted proteins. GDU also contains tueric, feverfew and quercetin, which help to reduce inflamation and relieve pain. Next, it is reasonable to claim that these ingredients as a whole may be used as an adjunct to cancer therapy, and that the ingredients possess a wide range of actions as anti-inflamatory agents.\" Ex. 3. d. BioMi \"There is a reasonable basis for the clais that the ingredients ofBioMixx 'boosts the imune system,oo.to allow for natual healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destrctive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. ,,, Ex. 4. \"There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of BioMixx boost the immune system, build lean body mass and support healing. It is also reasonable to claim that these ingredients assist the body in fighting cancer, cachexia and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" Ex. 3. 12 C. Respondents Disseminate Accurate, Substantiated Structure and Functions Claims for DCO Products... 1. Respondents Say: a. Bioshark \"is pure skeletal tissue of sharks which provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis -- the formation of new blood vessels. This can stop tumor growth and halt the progression of eye diseases. . . \" b. The tea 7 Herb Formula \"purifes the blood, promotes cell repair, fights tumor formation, andfights pathogenic bacteria\" c..GDU \"contains natural proteolytic enzymes (fom pineapple source bromelain) to help digest protein --even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. This formula also helps to relieve pain and heal inflammation. . . GDU is also usedfor. . . and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. GDU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic activity. . . \" d. BioMixx immune system, cleanses the blood andfeeds the endocrine system to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. \" e. On each product label: \"These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\" f. Each of Respondents\" web sites says \"The information on this website is intended to provide information, record, and testimony about God and His Creation. It is not intended to diagnose a disease. The information provided on this site is designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists between a patient/site visitor and his/her health care provider. Caution: some herbs or supplements should not be mixed with certain medications.\" 2. Respondents do not say that \"the DCO Products were effective in preventing, treating, or curng cancer.\" Respondents not only did not say that their products are \"effective\" in preventing, treating or curing cancer,\" they do not believe it. They believe that the body has mechanisms to heal itself. They present their message, in the language set out about each of the products above, that says their products affect these mechanisms, assisting them to 13 perform their fuction or enhance their structue. Dr. Lamont and Dr. Duke explicitly said that herbal science supports the claims made by DCO. Ex. 3 and Ex. 4. Respondents clearly and unequivocally offer a different, natual, choice to their followers. It is a choice that interested individuals can make separate from or in conjunction with standard chemotherapeutic or radiation treatments. In her deposition, Dr. Lamont described the mindset of someone who might share Respondents' view of this set of alternatives. She said: Occasionally there wil be a person who, for maybe religious purposes or they just live in a different mindset, that there is no way they're going to subject themselves to the traumas and poisoning effect of chemotherapy and radiation. And let's face it. It is poisoning. I mean, these are cytotoxic agents and not in the sense of, you know, curcumin could kil a cancer cell, but these go in and kil all rapidly reproducing cells in the body. And you lose muscle mass and you lose multiple organ fuction, and it drives many people to the brink of death just from the therapy. And if they're lucky, they recuperate and can live with that five-year survival rate and be proclaimed a success. Lots don't. And I think -- what are we up to --65 percent now of people can live five years past their -- concluding their treatment. Ex. 5. 3.. Respondents make and substantiate structure and function claims, as set out for the products above, that the products in question assist the body by reinforcing its natural innate capacity to correct imbalance and help the body diminish disease by strengthening the body's natural healing functions, to assist it in maintaining coherence and wellness, and assisting the body in achieving and maintaining the structural balance that helps it diminish the effects of cancer and other disease including for those taking chemotherapy. Respondents assert that the statement or claims made about the products they provide to members of their community were intended to be in support of Normal Structure and Function Claims permitted under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and the regulations thereunder. The Respondents further assert that 14 they do in fact have reasonable evidence for their claims, including, in addition to the testimony and reports of their expert witnesses which explicitly state that herbal science supports the DCO statements for each product, Traditional Use and Biblical substantiation which Respondents assert are valid and lawfl substantiation for claims made paricularly in an Expressive Association context. Respondents assert that they and their communicants are engaging in Expressive Association as a private association, protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution for the United States of America. See: Boy Scouts Of America V Dale (99-699) 530 U.S. 640 (2000) 160 N. J. 562, 734 A. 2d 1196. The relatively small number of users ofDCO products, the high ratio of information to product use-two hours a day on the radio, several web sites, news letters and various manuals-all of which repeat the structure\u00ad fuction message of the statements presented for the products above, and five small stores that asked to make DCO products available to their communities all reinforce the fact that DCO is in a community of people with shared beliefs involved in an Expressive Association rather than a business organized to make a profit. Complaint Counsel misread the nature of the dispute in this case. There is here a paradigm clash. Counsel and the FTC assert and apparently believe that the only legitimate proper evidence for a par to rely on in makng claims about dietary supplements such as herbs is the classical testing of dangerous single chemical entities. As Respondents' expert Dr. Rustu Roy made clear, this is not an appropriate approach to testing natural products that pose no inherent risk, have been around for centues-maybe as long as the Bible-and have traditional use profiles. 15 As Respondents' herbal expert Dr. James Duke pointed out, it is estimated that there are as many as five thousand single chemical entitles in tueric, one herb used by Respondents. It is patently obvious that the classical testing of herbal ingredients in the way dangerous single chemical entities are tested is impractical, unwise and dangerous- depriving individuals of herbs useful to their health. The fact of the matter is that the herbal world has accepted scientific norms-which by the way Dr. Miler, Complaint Counsel's cancer expert, acknowledged that he was unamiliar with--with which Respondents have complied. The fact that Complaint Counsel has chosen to argue that the only way to comply with the law is to subject herbs to the same standard as single chemical entities means that Counsel has failed to meet the FTC's responsibility to address the nature of the herbal claims made-Counsel has not provided evidence on the net impression of the claims, the natue of the audience to which they are addressed, substantiation, the state interest being vindicated or the existence of herbal science that supports Respondents'. Their failure to address these issues means that Complaint Counsel is not entitled to a sumar decision. In fact, their failure to address these issues entitles Respondents to a sumar decision as set out in Respondents' Motion for Sumar Decision. Citizens Have the Right to Seek Alternatives to Standard Medicine The Respondents assert the right of consumers to intentionally forgo standard treatment and engage in other methods to achieve and maintain a healthy status. This interest of citizens is especially significant in the context of a private association for religious dietary and nutritional expressive activities. 16 In the case of State v Biggs (46 SE Reporter 401, 1903) the North Carolina Supreme Court dealt with a person who was advising people as to diet, and administering massage, baths and physical culture. In the Biggs case, the defendant \"advertised himself as a 'nonmedical physician'... (and) held himself out to the public to cure disease by 'a system of drugless healing'...\" p.40 1. That Court held that there could be no \"state system of healing\" p.402 and while \"Those who wish to be treated by practitioners of medicine and surgery had the guaranty that such practitioners had been duly examined...those who had faith in treatment by methods not included in the 'practice of medicine and surgery' as usually understood, had reserved to them the right to practice their faith and be treated, if they chose, by those who openly and avowedly did not use either surgery or drugs in the treatment of diseases...\" pA02. Biggs was acquitted. \"The state has not restricted the cure of the body to the practice of medicine and surgery -- allopath, as it is termed, -- nor required that, before anyone can be treated for any bodily il, the physician must have acquired a competent knowledge of allopath and be licensed by those skiled therein. To do that would be to limit progress by establishing allopathy as the state system of healing, and forbidding all others. This would be as foreign to our system as a state church for the cure of souls. All the state has done has been to enact that, when one wished to practice medicine or surgery, he must, as a protection to the public (not to the doctor), be examined and licensed by those skiled in surgery and medicine. To restrict all healing to that one kind -- to allopath, excluding homeopathy, osteopathy, and all other treatments -- might be a protection to doctors in surgery and medicine; but that is not the object of the act, and might make it unconstitutional, because 17 creating a monopoly.\" North Carolina's Supreme Court in State v MacKnight, 42 S.E. 580, 1902 at p 582. In Hilman/Kohan Eyeglasses, Inc v New Jersey State Board, 169 NJ Super 259, the Court observed that, absent compellng health reasons, consumers should have choices in the competitive marketplace, and further, that if the legislatue had intended to create a monopoly, it would have done so by specific grant of monopoly, which it did not do in the case of optometry, nor, we assert, in the case of nutritional support for persons concerned with diagnosed diseases such as cancer. People have the right to obtain unlicensed, private professional health care services. The Southern District of Texas case of Andrews v. Ballard (498 F Supp 1038, 1980) is cited as a leading authority for the propositions that (1) a decision to obtain (in this case) acupuncture needle treatments from one not licensed as a medical doctor is a constitutional right encompassed by the right of privacy (p.1 048) and (2) the provisions of the medical practices act, insofar as they limit the use of acupuncture needles to licensed physicians, are unconstitutional (p.1051, et seq.). The North Carolina Supreme Cour concluded, nearly a century ago in State v. Biggs, supra., at pA05: \"Medicine is an experimental, not an exact science. All the law can do is to regulate and safeguard the use of powerful and dangerous remedies, like the knife and drgs, but it canot forbid dispensing with them. When the Master, who was himself called the Good Physician, was told that other than his followers were casting out devils and curing diseases, he said, 'Forbid them not.'\" p.405. Traditional Use Claims and the FTC 18 Based upon the FTC's own Internet postings, Complaint Counsel has ignored a significant basis for the substantiation of the nutritional claims made by the Respondents. \"Claims based on historical or traditional use should be substantiated by confirming scientific evidence, or should be presented in such a way that consumers understand that the sole basis for the claim is a history of use of the product for a particular purpose. A number of supplements, paricularly botanical products, have a long history of use as traditional medicines in the United States or in other countries to treat certain conditions or symptoms. Several European countries have a separate regulatory approach to these traditional medicines, allowing manufacturers to make certain limited claims about their traditional use for treating certain health conditions. Some countries also require accompanying disclosures about the fact that the product has not been scientifically established to be effective, as well as disclosures about potential adverse effects. At this time there is no separate regulatory process for approval of claims for these traditional medicine products under DSHEA and FDA labeling rules.\" http://ww .ftc. gov /bcp/ conline/pubslbuspubs/ dietsupp .htm FTC - Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry. FTC continues - \"In assessing claims based on traditional use, the FTC wil look closely at consumer perceptions and specifically at whether consumers expect such claims to be backed by supporting scientific evidence. Advertising claims based solely on traditional use should be presented carefully to avoid the implication that the product has been scientifically evaluated for efficacy. The degree of qualification necessary to communicate the absence of scientific substantiation for a traditional use claim wil depend in large par on consumer understanding of this category of products. As consumer 19 awareness of and experience with \"traditional use\" supplements evolve, the extent and type of qualification necessary is also likely to change. \"There are some situations, however, where traditional use evidence alone will be inadequate to substantiate a claim, even if that claim is carefully qualified to convey the limited nature of the support. In determining the level of substantiation necessary to substantiate a claim, the FTC assesses, among other things, the consequences of a false claim. Claims that, if unfounded, could present a substantial risk of injury to consumer health or safety wil be held to a higher level of scientific proof. For that reason, an advertiser should not suggest, either directly or indirectly, that a supplement product wil provide a disease benefit unless there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate that benefit. The FTC will closely scrutinize the scientific support for such claims, paricularly where the claim could lead consumers to forego other treatments that have been validated by scientific evidence, or to self-medicate for potentially serious conditions without medical supervision. \"The advertiser should also make sure that it can document the extent and maner of historical use and be careful not to overstate such use. As part of this inquiry, the advertiser should make sure that the product it is marketing is consistent with the product as traditionally administered. If there are significant differences between the traditional use product and the marketed product, in the form of administration, the formulation of ingredients, or the dose, a \"traditional use\" claim may not be appropriate. \"Example 29: The advertiser of an herbal supplement makes the claim, \"Ancient folklore remedy used for centuies by Native Americans to aid digestion.\" The statement about traditional use is accurate and the supplement product is consistent with the 20 formulation ofthe product as traditionally used. However, if, in the context of the ad, this statement suggests that there is scientific evidence demonstrating that the product is effective for aiding digestion, the advertiser would need to include a clear and prominent disclaimer about the absence of such evidence. \"Example 30: A supplement manufacturer wants to market an herbal product that has been used in the same formulation in China as a tonic for improving mental fuctions. The manufacturer prepares the product in a manner consistent with Chinese preparation methods. The ad claims, \"Traditional Chinese Medicine - Used for Thousands of Years to Bring Mental Clarity and Improve Memory.\" The ad also contains language that clearly conveys that the efficacy of the product has not been confirmed by research, and that traditional use does not establish that the product will achieve the claimed results. The ad is likely to adequately convey the limited natue of support for the claim. One can see from the above FTC analysis that RISK and BENEFIT wil be weighed on a spectru of risk - at one end are products that support natural structure and fuction and at the other end are products that claim to treat life-threatening diseases. The distinction between \"treat\" life-threatening diseases and offering \"therapies\" that may benefit normal structure and fuction for persons facing such diseases is well founded in law. Let us therefore consider the use ofthe terms \"therapy\" and \"therapeutic\" with reference to alternative health practices. It compares those terms to the term-of-ar, \"treatment of disease.\" Alternative health practices can be generally defined as traditional 21 or other practices that are used by individuals, often for self-help, to achieve and maintain a healthy status, either on their own or complementar to standard medical care. These practices do not include the potentially dangerous use of invasive techniques and toxic drugs that are the province oflicensed medicine. They do, however, include developing therapies and nonstandard approaches that are outside the scope of licensed medicine. These are sometimes referred to as \"Complementar and Alternative Modalities\" (CAM). CAM health practices can be generally defined as traditional or other practices that are used by individuals, often for self-help, to achieve and maintain a healthy status, either on their own or complementary to standard medical care. These practices do not include the potentially dangerous use of invasive techniques and toxic drugs that are the sole province of licensed medicine. They do, however, include developing therapies and nonstandard approaches that are outside the scope of licensed medicine. Such approaches as Nutrition, Homeopathy, Hands-on-Healing, Magnetics, Sound Health, Energy Therapies, Biofeedback, Meditation, Breath Work, Reiki, Chi Gong, Tai Chi and Herbology are examples of complementary and alternative therapeutic practices. Traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic medicine or folk remedies and \"Dr. Mom\" home remedies are also examples of CAM practices. The terms \"therapy\" and \"therapeutic\" do not occur, for example, in the context of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). Rather, that statute, passed unanimously by Congress, tells us that Dietary Supplements may not \"diagnose, treat, cure or prevent\" any disease. It does not specifically forbid the use of the word \"therapy\" (or \"therapeutic\"). Under the Supreme Court's rule in the Thompson v Western 22 Medical 535 U. S. 357 (2002) 238 F.3d 1090, affirmed. case, we should expect that these words would not be forbidden by the Cours. Furher, the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association has also begun to acknowledge an independent use of the term \"therapy.\" The original Hippocratic Oath, with its injunction to \"Do no harm.\" has been replaced by a complex Code detailing the relationship between physician and patient and alternative practitioner. Changes made during the early 1990's were inspired by anti-trust lawsuits brought during the 1980's by chiropractors and others. These changes are just now becoming recognized by regulators and cours. While \"treatment which has no scientific basis\" remains condemned (Opinion 3.01), under Opinion 3.04, physicians are free to \"refer\" a patient \"for therapeutic or diagnostic services to another physician, limited practitioner or any other provider of health care services permitted by law to furnish such services, whenever he or she believes that this may benefit the patient.\" Thus, unscientific \"treatment\" is distinguished from \"health care services permitted by law.\" \"Treatment\" -- which means the use of standard medicine and surgery to \"cure\" disease -- is distinguished from other health care services (therapies) which need only meet the lesser \"may benefit\" standard. While physicians \"prescribe\" treatments for disease, therapies that may benefit may be subject to \"referral\" thereby further indicating the distinction. Thus, for example, Dietary Supplements that support normal structure and function to support therapeutic outcomes can be seen to complement licensed medicine, but not to be held to its strictures, nor limited in its practice to licensed physicians. Since 23 such therapies are not prescription services, members of the public may choose such services without the permission of their physician. The claims made for Therapeutic Nutritionals must, of course, be allowed Structure and Function Claims. Thus, for example, one canot claim that a nutrient (except for plant sterols) lowers cholesterol levels - since there is now a \"disease\" of hypercholesterolemia -but can claim that a nutrient maintains normal cholesterol levels for persons with normal cholesteroL. A purveyor may say that a certain combination of multivitamins was designed to maintain normal structure and function for a person with diabetes, but not that the combination treats diabetes or affects the blood sugar leveL. Similarly, any claim made for any alternative practice must meet the FTC standard of \"truthful and not misleading\" and must be based on reasonable substantiation. Telling people what an alternative practitioner does NOT do is as important as tellng what is done. It is therefore important to include the proper Disclaimers for any use of alternative practices. As the High Cour said in Thompson, \"We have previously rejected the notion that the Governent has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information. * * * Even if the Governent did argue that it had an interest in preventing misleading advertisements, this interest could be satisfied by the far less restrictive alternative of requiring... a warning...\" What is the proper level of substantiation for alternative practice claims? It is not the \"significant scientific agreement\" required of drug claims, but rather, the general \"competent scientific evidence\" standard that applies to all commercial claims. That does not necessarily mean that pureyors need to have multiple double-blind experiments (as 24 \" may be required for drug approval). Such substantiation just needs to be competent and scientific. This means research studies (which is when scientists review the work of others and apply it to specific questions) and clinical trials (which can be as formal as double- blind, placebo controlled investigations) as well as traditional knowledge and clinical experience all have a role to play, but ultimately, such substantiation must rest on the informed professional opinion of some credentialed person who can (in the case of Dietary Supplements, for example) sign onto the Structure and Function Claims Notice to the FDA, attesting that \"the notifying firm has substantiation that the Statement to which this Notice applies is truthful and not misleading.\" (Regulations under 21 U.S.C. 403(r) (6)). Many times people seek to make claims based on Traditional Uses. This is what the FTC says, \"Claims based on historical or traditional use should be substantiated by confirming scientific evidence, or should be presented in such a way that consumers understand that the sole basis for the claim is a history of use of the product for a particular purpose. A number of supplements, particularly botanical products, have a long history of use as traditional medicines in the United States or in other countries to treat certain conditions or symptoms. Several European countries have a separate regulatory approach to these traditional medicines, allowing manufacturers to make certain limited claims about their traditional use for treating certain health conditions. Some countries also require accompanying disclosures about the fact that the product has not been scientifically established to be effective, as well as disclosures about potential adverse effects. At this time there is no separate regulatory process for approval of claims for these traditional medicine products under DSHEA and FDA labeling rules. * * * The advertiser 25 should also make sure that it can document the extent and maner of historical use and be careful not to overstate such use. As par of this inquiry, the advertiser should make sure that the product it is marketing is consistent with the product as traditionally administered. If there are significant differences between the traditional use product and the marketed product, in the form of administration, the formulation of ingredients, or the dose, a \"traditional use\" claim may not be appropriate.\" Throughout the world today people are looking to traditional methodologies and leading-edge CAM techniques because they offer alternatives to toxic, expensive drugs with their dangerous side effects, un-manageable and uneasonable costs and other invasive technologies of modern medicine. This search for alternatives is protected by the fundamental right of individuals to communicate and lear; to heal and be healed. This has been settled law for over a hundred years. \"The state has not restricted the cure of the body to the practice of medicine and surgery -- allopathy, as it is termed, -- nor required that, before anyone can be treated for any bodily il, the physician must have acquired a competent knowledge of allopathy and be licensed by those skiled therein. To do that would be to limit progress by establishing allopathy as the state system of healing, and forbidding all others. This would be as foreign to our system as a state church for the cure of souls. All the state has done has been to enact that, when one wished to practice medicine or surgery, he must, as a protection to the public (not to the doctor), be examined and licensed by those skiled in surgery and medicine. To restrict all healing to that one kind -- to allopathy, excluding homeopathy, osteopathy, and all other treatments -- might be a protection to doctors in surgery and 26 -,.~ i \"1 medicine; but that is not the object of the act, and might make it unconstitutional, because creating a monopoly.\" North Carolina's Supreme Court in State v MacKnight, 42 S.E. 580, 1902 at p 582. The problem raised by these examples and the issues they address is not how they should be resolved. The problem is that Complaint Counsel has comely ignored they existence and ;owe ahead arguing the only answer the atsuppled by their cancer expert as appropriate for single entity inherently dangerous chemicals that might have some benefit that outweighs there harm. Cjompnat Counsel fied to address the issues that are at the hear of the case. Respondent has presented evidence that they complied with the standards that govern herbal claims. Complaint counsel has presented no evidence they have not. CONCLUSION Complaint Counsel's motion for Sumary Decision should be denied. Dated this 10th day of March, 2009.

It was not Respondents' practice to obtain scientific studies about any of the components in their products. P. F eijo Dep. Tr. at 120, i. 9- 19. 155. Respondents did not search for scientific studies regarding the components in their products because \"(w)e're working with people, and again, it's experiential and it's working with the whole person.\" P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 120, i. 20-22. 156. James Feijo agrees that individual results may var and that what one person says in her testimonial may not apply to other people. J. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 141, 1. 19-25 - 142, i. 1-8. 157. According to Patricia Feijo, \"only God can cure cancer.\" P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 115, i. 19\u00ad 20. 158. According to Patricia Feijo, \"We (James and Patricia Feijo) do have knowledge that is experientiaL. We have seen how these products work. God has shown us (James and Patricia Feijo) and given us a wealth of knowledge and information that - - and we felt it is very truthful and actually our duty to share with people.\" P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 116, I. 12-26. BioShark 159. Respondents conducted no scientific testing on Bio*Shark. P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 161, I. 12-16. 160. Respondents' substantiation for the statement that \"(p lure skeletal tissue of sharks. . . can stop tumor growth\" is \"from the material that (they) had read that shark cartilage provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis and the information (they) have that (they) have. . . read and complied for many years now.\" P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 157, I. 16-20. 161. Patricia Feijo is not aware of any other studies that might have been done on Bio*Shark or shark carilage other than Dr. Lane's studies. P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 162, 1. 5-16. 162. Universal Nutrition did not conduct any testing, quality or otherwise, on Bio*Shark. Kinney Dep. Tr. at 45, I. 19-25 - 46, 1. 1. 7 Herb Formula 163. Respondents never had an outside lab study the components of7 Herb Formula to see whether its components actually have the effect that Respondents believe it has. P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 132, 1. 11-15. 21 164. Rather than having an outside lab study the components of7 Herb Formula to determine whether its components were actually having the effect Respondents believe, Respondents have \"experiential information (and) many testimonies, many hundreds if not thousands of testimonies.\" P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 132,1. 16-18. 165. Respondents' basis for asserting that using 7 Herb Formula will help someone with any the separate ingredients tye of cancer is \"their knowledge about the structure/function of and the history of the herbal formally, so experientially. . . (they) can say generally that if you suffer from any type of cancer that (Respondents) suggest taking (7 Herb Formula).\" P. FeijoDep. Tr. at 175,1. 23-25 -176, 1. 1-7. GDU 166. GDU was never subjected to clinical trials. P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 190, i. 20-21. 167. Respondents have not done any studies to know whether GDU would counteract with any conventional cancer medicine someone was taking. P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 194, 1. 11- 1 4. BioMixx 168. Respondents did not conduct any tests or clinical studies on BioMixx. P. Feijo Dep. Tr. at 199, i. 15-18. 169. Respondents did not engage anybody else to do any kind of clinical tests on BioMixx. P. FeijoDep. Tr. at 199,1. 19-21. 170. Respondents' basis for asserting that BioMixx fights cancer is \"(b)ased on the structure of the ingredients, what we know that to be, and based on the function of those ingredients, what we know that to be, and based on the experiential evidence, the witness of many.\" P. FeijoDep. Tr. at 199, i. 22-25 - 200, i. 1-4. 171. Universal Nutrition has not conducted any testing on BioMixx. Kinney Dep. Tr. at 50, i. 8-9. G. DR. MILLER CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS NO COMPETENT AND RELIABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIMS THAT DCO'S PRODUCTS TREAT. CURE. OR PREVENT CANCER Introduction 172. Denis R. Miller, M.D. is a board-certified pediatric hematologist/oncologist. S.D. Ex. 1 Complaint Counsel's Expert Denis R. Miler, M.D., dated February 18,(Declaration of 2009, attaching Denis R. Miler, M.D. Expert Report (hereinafter referred to as D. Miler Expert Report) at 1). 22 173. For over 40 years, Dr. Miler has directed clinical care, education, laboratory and clinical research, and administration, heading divisions or departments at University of Rochester Medical Center, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Northwestern University Medical SchooL. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 1). 174. Dr. Miler also has served as Associate Medical Director of Cancer Treatment Centers of America (\"CTCA\") as well as Scientific Director of CTCA's Cancer Treatment Research Foundations. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 1). 175. As Scientific Director, Dr. Miler supervised the clinical research program and was principal investigator for a number of Phase VII clinical studies involving treatments for hematological malignancies and cancers of the head and neck, lung, breast, pancreas, and colon. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 1 -2). 176. Dr. Miller has authored or co-authored over 300 book chapters, peer-reviewed articles, and abstracts, and has served on the editorial boards of the British Journal of Hematology and the American Journal of Clinical Oncology. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 3). 177. Dr. Miller currently is the Oncology/Hematology Therapeutic Area Leader at P AREXEL International, a leading contract research organization, where he manages clinical trials for the pharmaceutical industr. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 2). 178. To constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence, a product that purports to treat, cure, or prevent cancer must have its effcacy and safety demonstrated through controlled clinical studies. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 7). 179. Only data from well-designed, controlled, clinical trials wil substantiate claims that a new therapy is safe and effective to treat, cure, or prevent cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 30). 180. Anecdotal reports of product efficacy are the weakest form of evidence supporting the anticancer activity ofa new agent. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 12). 181. Testimonials do not substitute for a well-designed clinical trial in proving the efficacy of a supposed cancer fighting product. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 30). 182. Dr. Miller's thorough review of peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents produced by DCO indicates that there is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that the DCO Products are effective either alone or in combination with other DCO products in the treatment or cure of cancer, in inhibiting tumor formation, and in preventing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 31). 23 Bio *Shark the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that Bio*Shark inhibits tumor growth in humans or that it is effective in the treatment of cancer in humans. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 13). 183. Dr. Miler's review ofthe peer-reviewed literatue and all of 184. Dr. Miler found that there were no adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating that Bio*Shark is antiangiogenic or is effective in the treatment of cancer, and even supporting non-clinical studies of crude or partially-purfied shark carilage products were extremely limited, particularly with regard to mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, pharacodynamics, and dose response. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 17). 185. Dr. Miler observed that Respondents' reliance on Dr. i. Wiliam Lane's book, \"Sharks Don't Get Cancer\" was misplaced, as studies at Johns Hopkins University indicate that sharks do indeed get cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 16). 7 Herb Formula the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumor formation and is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer in humans. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 18). 186. Dr. Miler's review of the peer-reviewed literature and all of 187. Dr. Miler found neither non-clinical nor clinical studies supporting claims that 7 Herb Formula or any of its individual ingredients are effective anticancer agents or inhibit tumor formation. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 19). 188. Any relevant studies on the ingredients Burdock root, Cat's Claw, sheep sorrel, slippery elm bark, turkish rhubarb root, Siberian ginseng, and watercress were performed either in vitro or on animals, not on humans with cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 19-22). GDU 189. Dr. Miler's review of the peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that GDU eliminates tumors and is effective in the treatment of cancer in humans. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 22). 190. Dr. Miler found no randomized, controlled clinical trials of any of the individual components of GDU or of GDU itself in patients with cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). 24 191. Dr. Miler, however, did note that curcumin (tumeric), one ofGDU's ingredients, is currently being evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine its potential as a chemoprotective and cancer preventive agent. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 22). 192. Animal studies have suggested that curcumin may have activity as a cancer preventive and therapeutic agent. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 23). 193. Nevertheless, Dr. Miler cautioned that some studies have suggested that curcumin may actually inhibit the anticancer activity of some approved anticancer agents as well as exacerbate iron deficiency. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). 194. Thus, Dr. Miler advised that further research on curcumin was necessary. S.D. Ex. i (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). BioMix 195. Dr. Miler's review of the peer-reviewed literature and all of the documents Respondents submitted as substantiation indicates that there was no competent and reliable scientific evidence that BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer and heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27). 196. Dr. Miller found that there are no reported studies of either BioMixx or its constituent ingredients being effective in the treatment of cancer. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 27-28). 197. Dr. Miller also found \"absolutely no data\" to support the claim that BioMixx is used to heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. S.D. Ex. 1 (D. Miler Expert Report at 29). H. RESPONDENTS' EXPERTS DO NOT POSSESS ANY INFORMATION SUBSTANTIATING RESPONDENTS' CLAIMS Introduction James Duke. Ph.D. 198. James Duke, Ph.D. (\"Duke\") has never met Jim and Patricia Feijo. Deposition of James Duke, Ph.D. (hereinafter referred to as Duke Dep. Tr.) at 8, i. 6-9. 199. Duke is not a medical doctor. Duke Dep. Tr. at 56, 1. 3-5. 200. Duke is not licensed to practice medicine in any state. Duke Dep. Tr. at 56, 1. 6-8. 201. Duke is not a board-certified oncologist. Duke Dep.

Tr. at 18, i. 8. 204. Duke would not recommend that people self-medicate with herbal remedies in treating cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 135, 1. 17-22. 205. Duke is sure that there is a risk that some people will pursue herbal medications instead of effective pharaceutical medications and thereby die. Duke Dep. Tr. at 136, i. 20-23. 206. Duke does not recall any holistic physicians who have consulted with him on the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 19, i. 10-13. 207. Duke does not recall any homeopaths who have consulted with him on the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 19, 1. 14-17. 208. Duke has never managed or participated in any studies to measure the efficacy of an herb in treating cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 29, i. 15-22. 209. Duke does not remember ever being a consultant on a study where the anticancer effects patients. Duke Dep. Tr. at 29, i. 23-25 \u00ad of an herb were being measured on a group of 30, i. 1-2. 210. Duke does not remember seeing the FTC's Complaint against Respondents. Duke Dep. Tr. at 36, i. 19-22. 211. Duke has no knowledge of any of the advertisements that the FTC has challenged as the predicate for the Complaint. Duke Dep. Tr. at 36, 1. 23-25 - 37, i. 1-2. 212. Duke was not sent any of Respondents' products. Duke Dep. Tr. at 37, 1. 3-5. 213. Duke has not spoken to any persons who have taken DCO products for the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 38, 1. 23-25. 214. Duke has not reviewed the medical records of anyone who claims to have taken DCO products for the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 39, 1. 1-4. 215. Duke had never heard ofDCO until this case. Duke Dep. Tr. at 39, i. 9-10. 216. Duke has never listened to the DCO Radio program. Duke Dep. Tr. at 39, 1. 11-14. 26 217. Duke knows of no tests where the patient prays and one group of patients gets a Biblically referenced herb and the other group of patient prays and gets an allopathic treatment. Duke Dep. Tr. at 41, i. 20-25 - 42, 1. 1-2. 218. Duke does not think that \"the FDA permits advertising for cancer unless clinically proven.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 46, i. 19-22. 219. Duke's \"Multiple Activity Menus\" (\"MAMs\") are an attempt to identify herbs that show promise in fighting disease. Duke Dep. Tr. at 91, 1. 20-23. 220. The MAM and the ratio that it yields does not prove that anyone ofthese herbs is effective in fighting or treating cancer. Rather, \"(i)t adds a listing of the chemicals in that herb that have been shown or assumed to help with cancer.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 92, 1. 5-11. 221. When entering in the MAM an activity for an herb, Duke only enters references to that source \"as it may be a good source ( or) it may be a bad source.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 93, 1. 8-13. 222. Duke acknowledged that it is a \"gut feeling\" on how he makes sure that the studies he references in the MAMs are reliable. Duke Dep. Tr. at 108, i. 17-21. 223. Duke acknowledged that his MAMs have not been cited in any peer-reviewed journal. Duke Dep. Tr. at 113,1. 2-4. 224. Duke explained that his Indication Evaluations (\"IE\") is where he has \"gone through all these abstracts over the years (and) I've scored for a given indication. Ifit's folklore and that's all I have, it would receive an 't; ifit has a chemical or an epidemiological or an animal or an in vitro evidence, I've given it a 1; and then the 2, as we mentioned earlier, that means it's either been clinically approved - - an extract of the plant has been clinically approved or it's been approved by the Commission E or the Tramil Commission for that indication. These are lines of evidence that point to me which ones are most important and should be studied for cancer.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 59, i. 7-21; 118, i. 10-13; 119, i. 7-9. information.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 109, i. 8-10. 225. The IE is a \"compendium of 226. There is no relationship between the MAMs and the IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 92, 1. 12-20. 227. Neither the MAMs nor the IE reflect information that indicates that turmeric, for example, is effective in the treatment of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 109, 1. 25 - 110, i. 1-6. 228. Duke has never measured the efficacy of herbs as a treatment for cancer in a controlled patient population. Duke Dep. Tr. at 55, 1. 21-24. 27 229. Duke is not able to express opinions on what the minimum dosage would be necessary to achieve cancer-fighting. Duke Dep. Tr. at 67,1. 24-25 - 68, 1. 1. 230. Duke recognizes the difference between something being efficacious in an in vitro study and something being effcacious in human beings. Duke Dep. Tr. at 71, i. 20-24. 231. As a matter of science, Duke does not believe that the herbal extract working in vitro proves that it would work in a human. Duke Dep. Tr. at 77, 1. 10-24. 232. Rather than relying solely on in vitro studies, Duke recommends \"the third ar-trial where the whole plant or an extract thereof is compared with a competing pharmaceuticaL.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 77, i. 17-24. 233. According to Duke, \"(t)he third arm would compare a given herb with a given pharaceutical and placebo.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 81, i. 17-23. 234. Other than the St. John's Wort trial that used a placebo and Zoloft, Duke is not aware of any other studies where an herb, a pharaceutical, and a placebo were studied in a side- by-side maner. Duke Dep. Tr. at 82, 1. 1-17. black cohosh as a major anticancer herb. Duke Dep. Tr. at 123, i. 5-13. 235. Duke does not think of the major things that are said about it.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 125, i. 23-25 - 126, i. 1-2. 236. Duke stated that there is no reference to cancer in eleuthero because \"that's not one of 237. Most of the studies Duke has seen have been for preventing cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 128,1.22-24. 238. Duke does not remember any studies specifically about treating cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 128,1. 25 - 129,1. 1-3. 239. Duke testified that anecdotal reports are \"even below. . . my lines of evidence.\" Duke Dep. Tr. at 131,1. 15-20. 240. Duke attributes the increase in life expectancy in the 150 years that pharaceuticals have been around to pharaceuticals themselves. Duke Dep. Tr. at 133, i. 9-15. 241. Duke does not believe that homeostatic balancing has been the subject of any peer- reviewed articles in connection with the treatment or cure of cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 133,1. 25 - 134, i. 1-12. 242. In Duke's IE, there have been no clinical trials as to the efficacy of black cohosh for cancer. Duke Dep. Tr. at 147, i. 8-25. 28 243. There are no clinical trials regarding garlic's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 148,1. 1-5. 244. There are no clinical trials regarding Yellow Root's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 149,1. 1-5. 245. There are no clinical trials regarding eleuthero's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 153,1. 3-7. 246. There are no clinical trials regarding soybean's efficacy as to cancer in Duke's IE. Duke Dep. Tr. at 153, i. 24-25 - 154,1. 1-7. 247. There are no entries for sarsaparlla in Duke's IE indicating that it has been evaluated for its effcacy in treating cancer in clinical trials. Duke Dep. Tr. at 156, 1. 21-24. 248. The editors of Duke's book, The Green Pharmacy Guide to Healing Foods, advised Duke to \"shy away from\" a section on cancer treatment. Duke Dep. Tr. at 178, i. 6-18. 249. Duke does not recall seeing any aricles that Mr. and Mrs. Feijo believe substantiated the claims that they made regarding the particular DCO Products. Duke Dep. Tr. at 185,1. 7\u00ad 11. 250. Duke has made no effort to evaluate whether the combination of the ingredients in each ofthe products that DCO sells - GDU, 7 Herb Formula, and BioMixx - has any synergistic effects. Duke Dep. Tr. at 190, 1. 10-21. 251. Duke made no effort to see whether there were any studies of any sort regarding the paricular products that DCO sells - GDU, 7 Herb Formula, and BioMixx. Duke Dep. Tr. at 190, i. 22-25 - 191,1. 1-4. James K. Dews 252. Respondents offer James K. Dews (\"Dews\") as an expert in \"(h)erbal formulations, specifically 7 Herb Formula.\" Deposition of James K. Dews (hereinafter referred to as J Dews Dep. Tr.) at 4, 1. 25 - 5, i. 1. 253. Dews attended the University of Texas at Arlington and Texas Wesleyan, but he did not finish college degrees at either institution. J Dews Dep. Tr. at 11, i. 2-15. 254. According to Dews, neutraceuticals involves the merging of food supplements and pharaceuticals. J Dews Dep. Tr. at 17, i. 25. 255. Neutraceuticals involves the extraction of certain chemical compounds that are in many foods or herbs. J Dews Dep. Tr. at 18,1. 14-18. 29 256. Consumers ingest neutraceuticals. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 18, i. 6. 257. The difference between a pharaceutical and a neutraceutica1 is that one can make a disease-curing claim with a pharmaceutical; one canot make a disease-curing claim with a neutraceutical. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 62, i. 17-18; see also 15,1. 12-13. 258. According to Dews, animal studies cannot be extrapolated to humans. J. Dews Dep. Tr. at 63, i. 18-25 - 64, i. 1-8. Rustum Rov. Ph.D. 259.

Roy does not have any formal training in medicine. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 26, 1. 9-11. 30 272. Roy has never treated or consulted with healers who were treating paricular patients. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 28, 1. 9-11. 273. Roy does not know what Daniel Chapter One sells. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 43, i. 6-8. 274. The practice of Daniel Chapter One selling products over the Internet to people that it had never seen, met, or examined the medical records for \"obviously limits\" homeopathy. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 50, i. 5-19. 275. Roy's ideal description of homeopathy would not include selling products over the Internet to persons that the seller has not met. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 51, i. 11-14. 276. It is not Roy's view that all herbal remedies are effective. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 60, i. 60, i. 23-25 - 61, 1. 1. 277. Roy has never been involved in trying to secure FDA approval for some medication. R. Roy Dep. Tr. at 79,1. 14-16. Jav Lehr 278. No one has ever consulted Jay Lehr (\"Lehr\") about using herbs in connection with cancer. Deposition of Jay Lehr (hereinafter referred to as J. Lehr Dep. Tr.) at 10, 1. 24-25 -11,1.1. 279. Lehr is not a cancer expert. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 15, i. 11. 280. Lehr would not speculate on whether Respondents' products could cure cancer; \"that's now outside my area of expertise.\" J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 33, i. 19-22. 281. Lehr has never spoken to Jim Feijo about his products that supposedly treat cancer or tumors. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 34, i. 2-5. 282. The only testing of pharaceutical drugs and herbal supplements that Lehr has been involved in involves testing on himself. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 15, 1. 18-25 - 16, 1. 1-6. 283. Lehr takes three DCO products every day - Endurosine, Mito/ A TP, and 18,1. 1-14. 284. The label for PrePost speaks to athletic training. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 38, i. 1-5. 285. Endorosine increases the oxygen-carrng capacity of the blood. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 38, i. 9-12. 286. Mito/ATP is a pure energy distilate. J. Lehr Dep. Tr. at 38, 1. 13-14. 31 287.

LaMont would not be comfortable with the Feijos saying that the DCO products are going to cure cancer. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 53, 1. 4-19. 348. LaMont can see why the Federal Trade Commission would have concerns about the statement that DCO's products are cancer solutions. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 127,1. 15-24. 349.

Tr. at 42,1. 24-25\u00ad 43, 1. 1. 450. LaMont agrees that it would be fair to stay that it's impossible today to state the degree to which ODU is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 45, 1. 21\u00ad 25 - 46, i. 1-8. 451. LaMont does not know whether GDU on its own at its dose would eliminate tumors. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 74, 1. 19-25 - 75, i. 1-3. 452. LaMont recommends curcumin to inhibit inflammation. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 27, i. 3-10. 453. LaMont recommends that her patients use turmeric in their diet and have them supplement it in a dose of around 300 milligrams a day. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 27, 1. 11-25. 454. LaMont's understanding is that 300 miligrams of turmeric per day has been commonly found to be effective at reducing inflammation. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 28, 1. 1 -5. 455. LaMont thinks that taking turmeric in high doses can inhibit clot formation. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 30, 1. 23-25 - 31, i. 1-4. 456. One clinical study that LaMont can mention came out last month and involved the use of turmeric or curcumin in patients with pancreatic cancer. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 38, 1. 7-25 \u00ad 39,1. 1-11. 457. According to LaMont, the 2008 study involving patients with pancreatic cancer used eight grams ofa curcuminoid a day. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 38, 1. 21-25 - 39, 1. 1-3. 458. LaMont believes that ODU contains 300 milligrams of turmeric. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 40, i. 16-21. 459. LaMont does not know whether 300 miligrams of turmeric were also studied in the context of the 2008 study. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 41, i. 1-3. 460. LaMont is not familiar with any clinical studies of curcumin at 300 milligrams per day. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 41, i. 15-23; 42, 1. 16-18. 461. LaMont has \"no way of knowing how many milligrams ( of quercetin) would produce a certain therapeutic response.\" LaMont Dep. Tr. at 64, 1. 13-22. 44 462. LaMont agreed that the dosage found in GDU is on the lower end of the therapeutic spectrum. LaMont Dep. Tr. at 67, 1. 8- 16. 463. LaMont agrees that there is a big difference between seeing bromelain work in the capacity of a swollen anle and having it work in the context of cancer. LaMont Dep.

I 1 Q. My name is Carole Paynter, and I'm an attorney 12 with the Federal Trade Commission. 13 Along here with me are my co-counsel, Ted Zang 14 and David Dulabon. 15 And we all represent the commission in this 16 case. 17 A. Okay. 18 Q. And you're here this morning to give your 19 deposition for all purposes. 20 A. Okay. 2 I MS. PAYNTER: Okay. And first, before we move 22 forward into your testimony, just I would like to put on 23 the record, Mr. Turner, what actually is the respondent 24 alleging Mr. Dews is an expert on. 25 MR. TURNER: Herbal formulations, specifically 1 (Pages 1 to 4) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 2/11/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 5 I 7 Herb Formula. I 2 MS. PAYNTER: Okay. Because I believe that the 2 .. .) submission you gave previously said preclaim 3 4 substantiation of respondents' challenged claims, so it 4 5 was very broad, so are you limiting that now? 5 6 MR. TURNER: Yes. Well, that's -- what I just 6 7 said is what it should be and that's what it should have 7 8 said, so I didn't catch that when it went in. 8 9 MS. PAYNTER: Okay. Just to 7 Herb Formula. 9 10 MR. TURNER: Correct. 10 i i MS. PAYNTER: Okay. Thank you. i i 12 THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of what charges the 12 13 FTC has made and I don't want to be. 13 14 BY MS. PAYNTER: 14 15 Q. Okay. Well, we'll see as we go forward what we 15 16 can get from you today. Okay? 16 17 As I mentioned, we are here to take your 17 18 testimony regarding matters in this case, the 18 19 Federal Trade Commission's action against 19 20 Daniel Chapter One and Mr. James Feijo, who is an 20 21 offcer and owner of the company. 21 22 A. Uh-huh. 22 23 23Q. First, have you ever been deposed before? 24 A. Oh, yes. 24 25 Q. Okay. And how many times have you been 25 6 1 i deposed? 2 A. I've lost count. Five or six times. 2 3 Q. And in what kind of action have you been 3 4 deposed? 4 5 A. This was mostly competitors, ex-employees, 5 6 things of that sort. 6 7 Q. Have you ever appeared as an expert witness in a 7 8 case? 8 9 A. I did in the State of New York -- New Jersey 9 io versus Alan Shair in which the state had charged him 10 1l with selling a not dangerous substance, and my testimony 1l 12 won him an acquittal and they changed the laws as a 12 13 result. 13 14 14Q. SO can you give me more information about that? 15 What was he sellng? 15 16 A. Yeah. I had a customer who was a psychologist, 16 17 not a psychiatrist, so he was not an M.D., he was a 17 18 Ph.D., and he was very much interested in products that 18 19 could be used for -- in his practice, and he had asked 19 20 me to produce a substance known as hydroxymethylbutyrate 20 21 or HMB. 21 22 Now, that is what is commonly sometimes referred 22 23 to as the date rape drug. Now, it is a drug. It is 23 24 used. And in the right amounts it's helpful in that it 24 25 helps to relax the patient. In large amounts you can 25 2 (Pages 5 to 8) 7 overrelax and actually knock the people out to where they don't know what's going on, and that's how this came about. And I told him I could not supply that because it was questionable, that he wouldn't know what to do with it or how to properly use it. He was not a physician, so therefore -- he was not a medical doctor; therefore, he could not use it. Then he said, Well, I've got to have it. And I said the closest thing I can get to it is beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is the common amino acid L-threonine, T-H-R-E-O-N-I-N-E, which has a similar action. And I said now -- he said he wanted to use it for research and so he wanted a kilo. Everyhing we do is metric, so that's I think metrically. And so'we supplied it, and I labeled it properly. Well, he got it and he was tellng his patients it was HMB. He got a knock on his door at two o'clock one morning, and they tore the door down and put him in prison, and so they were charging him with sellng an unapproved substance. In the meantime, they analyzed it and found that it was L-threonine. They checked our records, and it was indeed L-threonine. But they had to go on 8 through with the triaL. It ended up that they thanked me. And as a result, you have to be careful with chemical names. Just a slight difference can make a major difference in the way they work. Q. Okay. Well, do you remember what year that was, the case was? A. It's been about five or ten years ago. Q. Actually before we go on further, you mentioned drugs. i should ask you today, are you taking any medication that might affect your testimony today? A. No. Q. Okay. Thank you. And just -- i know you've been deposed before, so I know you've heard some of these instructions already, but you know, when you do answer, we need you to give a verbal response to the questions -\u00ad A. Yes, ma'am. Q. -- so the court reporter can take it down. If you don't understand something I've asked, please ask me to clarify it and, you know, let me know, and I'll rephrase it if! can. If there is -- if you need to take a break, just let me know, and at an appropriate time we can take a break. For The Record, Inc.

And 2 said, that you need me to correct, I'll go back and 2 then I went to the University of Texas at Arlington -\u00ad 3 correct it, and we can correct it on the record here 3 and of course the University of Texas has different 4 today. 4 schools around the state, and Arlington is between 5 Do you understand those instructions? 5 Dallas and Fort Worth -- and I majored in science. 6 A. Yes, ma'am. 6 Then my father was an accountant, and I was 7 I might mention, for her benefit, I'm stone deaf 7 helping him with his practice some, and so I also went 8 in that ear and I wear a hearing aid in this one, so I'm 8 to Texas Wesleyan, which is now a university, in 9 trying to speak clearly (indicating). 9 Fort Worth, and I majored in business administration and 10 Q. Am I speaking -- 10 accounting. II A. And I'll try to hear -- yes. You're doing 11 Q. And did you obtain a degree in any of the -\u00ad 12 fine. 12 A. Didn't finish it. 13 Q. Okay. Very good. Thank you. 13 Q. How many years did you attend college? 14 So sometimes I do speak fast. If I'm speaking 14 A. About two or three at UTA and about two at 15 too fast, please let me know and -- 15 Texas Wesleyan. 16 A. Okay. Yeah. But this bad ear is on her side, 16 Q. Since attending college, have you obtained any 17 so... 17 licenses or other certifications? 18 Q. Okay. 18 A. Well, I belong to quite a few of the different 19 So court reporter, you've been warned. You have 19 organizations involved, such as the tie, the 20 to shout. 20 AOAC (indicating). That's -- it used to be the 21 A. You'll notice I'll turn my head. 21 American Organization of Analytical Chemists. Now 22 Q. Okay. Well, do you want to sit on this side or 22 they -- it's international, so they just changed the 23 are you -- 23 name to AOAC. But that is the agency that sets the 24 A. No. It's fine. It's fine. I do pretty welL. 24 methods of analyzing chemical compounds and determining 25 This is a prett good hearing aid. 25 the correct or the offcial method of analysis, which is 10 12 1 Q. Okay. Good. the things I do in my profession. 1 one of 2 So you mentioned that you were involved in an 2 Q. Okay. And how long have you been a member of 3 action with the State of New Jersey as an expert, but 3 that group? 4 have you ever been involved in any action with yourself 4 A. I think you have to be there I think it's eight 5 or your company where the federal government has sued 5 or ten years before they give you a tie. 6 you? 6 Q. And do they give you a certification? 7 A. Right. Well, we do have two companies, but 7 A. Yes. 8 we've never been involved. We are regulated, certainly 8 Q. And is it something that you have to update 9 used to be inspected on a regular basis by the FDA. Now 9 annually? i 0 it's changed with the current situation. Usually it's 10 A. You have to be invited to join. You don't lIthe TDH, and sometimes the FDA follows up. 11 just -- they invite you. 12 Q. And what's the TDH? 12 Q. Okay. 13 A. Texas Department of Health. They do the primary 13 A. And usually they require a degree. I gave them 14 inspecting now. 14 my background and they said, Hey, you're in. 15 Q. Have you ever been sued by the Texas 15 Q~ Okay. 16 Department of Health? 16 A. Of course i also belong to the ACS, 17 A. No. i 7 American Chemical Society; International Society of 18 Q. Or any other -- or any action by them? 18 Pharmaceutical Engineers; International Food 19 A. No. I get along with them just fine. 19 Technologists; Cosmetic, Toiletries and Fragrances 20 (Discussion off the record initiated by the 20 Association -- we also make cosmetics -- you know, 21 court reporter.) 21 District Export CounciL. 22 BY MS. PAYNTER: 22 Q. What kind of associations are those, the ones 23 Q. Mr. Dews, can you tell me what your educational 23 you mentioned, the cosmetic association and -\u00ad 24 background is. 24 A. Well, if you're going to make cosmetics or 25 A. Yes. After high school -- I graduated from 25 perfumes or anything of that sort, then that's certainly 3 (Pages 9 to 12) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 2/11/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 13 15 1 an organization you would belong to. 1 don't remember them all and 1 didn't save the 2 And of course we kind of specialize -- we make 2 transcripts. 3 all kinds of products. We don't determine that. Our 3 Q. Okay. Well, just that in terms of, you know, 4 customers ask us what they want. But we do a lot of 4 your purpose here is to be as an expert -\u00ad 5 nutraceuticals, which we were the first company to make 5 A. Yeah. I'm called quite often. Like insurance 6 them, mostly because physicians were asking for those 6 companies will call me and ask me if some nutraceutical, 7 kinds of products. 7 would that -- they're trying -- someone is trying to get 8 it covered by insurance and would that just be 8 Q. Well, just going back, the associations, though, 9 those are trade associations? Do you get -- . .9 justified, and I said, well, theoretically it may not 10 A. Trade associations. Some ofthem are quasi. 10 because it's not intended to cure or help to cure a 11 Just like Food Chemical Codex, that's made up of 11 disease. 12 government and industry where they set the monographs 12 Nutraceuticals cannot be claimed to cure or help 13 for each ingredient and what it's used for and whether 13 to cure a disease. That's the definition, the legal 14 it's safe to use or what the -- what conditions it might 14 definition. 15 not be safe. 15 Q. Okay. In regards to -- well, let's go into what 16 16 your company -- you said -- you mentioned you have two Q. Okay. And going back to the case of the 17 State of New Jersey versus Mr. Shair -- was it Shair, 17 companies; is that correct? 18 was his name? 18 A. Yeah. Dews Research Laboratory only makes 19 A. Yeah. 19 products for other companies to sell, period. We don't 20 your testimony, were you testifying 20 get involved in the marketing. We've got enough to doQ. In terms of 21 just about what you had done for him? 21 just making the products. 22 A. What I had done which was confirmed by the tests 22 Q. And your other company, what's the other 23 that they ran. 23 company? 24 A. Now, unfortunately, it's kind of the analogy 24 Q. Okay. So were you testifying just about the 25 effects of the drug or more of the factual -- 25 would be like the farmer. the farmer doesn't get much 14 16 A. It's not a drug. Threonine is an amino acid. I for his crop, but the company marketing the food does 2 It's a food. 2 because they have the advertising behind them. '\" '\" The same thing with us. My customers make a 1 ,) Q. I apologize. Yeah. ,) 4 A. Okay. And that can get pretty tough because, 4 tremendous profit. I don't make that much. I have to 5 you know, who would know which is which. Sometimes 5 compete with companies that aren't as careful about the 6 there's a thin line. 6 quality, so price is definitely a driving factor. 7 But mainly that what I supplied was L-threonine. 7 Now, the profit is in the marketing. And there 8 i did label it correctly. What he relabeled it as was 8 are a lot of products which I became familiar with and a 9 out of my control. The only thing that I could -- if 9 lot of physicians saying, Yeah, I want you to make this 10 you ask my opinion, the only thing I could say he was 10 product, and 1'\\1 say, We\\1, this is the minimum order, Ii guilty of is poor judgment. 11 and then i can't afford that. But I hear that enough 12 and I say, Hmm, there's enough demand for that product, 12 Q. SO then your testimony wasn't really about the 13 effects of the amino acid, for example-- 13 why not -\u00ad 14 A. No. 14 Q. Okay. 15 A. -- put it in a company, so we formed a separate 15 Q. -- or effcacy; it was about the facts of the 16 actual -- 16 company, and that's a\\1 they do is market -- it's one of 17 A. The similarities in chemical construction. 17 my customers. 18 Q. Okay. And were you actually qualified as an 18 Q. What is the separate company? What's it 19 expert or you were just called as a witness? 19 called? 20 A. I was ca\\1ed as a witness in the -- in his 20 A. It's Dews Twenty First Century Products. 21 triaL. 21 Q. And that company actually sells products. 22 Q. Okay. Well, in terms of giving testimony based 22 A. Yeah. My wife and daughters run that company. 23 on your expertise in the pharmaceutical/nutraceutical 23 i don't -- certainly i -- the gentlemen would probably 24 area, have you ever given testimony in that regard? 24 agree with me if they've been married. You don't tell 25 A. Probably over the years, yes, but you know, I 25 your wife how to run her company; you advise her. 4 (Pages 13 to 16) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Dews 2/11/2009 17 I what kind 1 Q. And can you just give me an example of 2 of products you sell? 2 3 A. A lot of nutraceuticals, a lot of cosmeceuticals 3 4 in this country because they're much easier to make and 4 5 they're much easier to selL. The profit margins are 5 6 reasonable. 6 7 It's a good business to be in if your point is 7 8 to be in business. And I have to be. I have to 8 9 generate the cash flow. 9 10 Q. Well, are you involved in creating the products, io i I or is it just your wife and your daughters? 11 12 A. They market. I do most of the creation and -- 12 13 because I get the calls and then -- where they're not 13 14 willing to put up enough money to make a minimum batch, 14 15 so when I get enough calls, I say, Barbara, you know, 15 16 there's a lot of demand for this. 16 17 And a lot of times they're old drugs that are no 17 18 longer drugs. 18 19 Q. And Barbara is your wife? 19 20 A. My wife. 20 21 Q. Okay. Well, can you tell me -- you've used the 21 22 word \"nutraceuticals\" before. Can you just define what 22 23 those are? 23 24 A. Yeah. Basically they -- if you were to merge 24 25 food supplements and pharmaceuticals together, you would 25 18 1 get nutraceuticals. I 2 If you merged cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 2 ..3 together, you would get cosmeceuticals. That's what I ,) 4 was going to a while ago. 4 5 The difference? Well, of course, 5 6 nutraceuticals, you ingest it, and cosmeceuticals, you 6 7 put it on the outside. That's the nuts and bolts of the 7 8 actual manufacturing of nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, 8 9 phannaceuticals, OTe or prescription. It's the same. 9 10 The ingredients are different, but the technology is the 10 i 1 same. i 1 12 Q. Okay. So can you give me an example of a 12 13 nutraceutical? 13 14 A. Yeah. Right now, a very popular thing is to 14 15 extract out certain chemical compounds that are in many 15 16 foods, and this is interesting because, well, is it an 16 17 herb or is it a food. Well, the only difference is in 17 18 what you call it. 18 19 Q. Okay. 19 20 A. Now, does the herb do anything or does the food 20 21 do anything? Well, in a roundabout way, it's not the 21 22 herb or the food that's doing anything; it's the 22 23 chemicals that exist within that. And that's why we 23 24 have to be able to analyze these things, to measure, to 24 25 see if that chemical is there, and that's pharacology. 25 19 That's what I do. I received my basic scientific training. I took the courses in chemistry, physics, biology, all of this, pretty much in premed, but I went this direction. Then you take that and you -- it's the chemical that you want. You have to be able to analyze it. Now, a lot of times we'll take that food or that herb and we'll start separating it. We take it apart. That's the science of pharmacology. Now, I received my basic education and then I worked within companies, and I do work with a lot of universities with their research center and their scientists, and so I was trained after that by pharmacologists, mostly European, how to do this profession. Q. Okay. Well, can you tell me what kind of nutraceutical your company might produce? A. Sure. Well, popular when I started in that-\u00ad and this kind of gets -- and I apologize for that. It's not an easy question. Q. No. But just -\u00ad A. Hey, we've got five minutes. Tell me how to do a brain surgery. No. It doesn't work that way. But anyway, I was talking about one in particular, and that's the anthocyan ins. These are 20 things which have an antioxidant propert. And they exist in a lot of foods, particularly fruits, but they also exist in other foods. And the chemical compounds are very much identifiable. You can measure them. Now, we take that whole food, and what's the most largest percentage in there? Water. Is that a chemical? Is that the chemical we want? No. So we get rid of the water. The second thing, well, fiber. Does fiber? No. We're looking for this chemicaL. By removing things we increase the level of the chemicaL. This is traditional pharmacology. This is just standard -- it's Phanacology 101. Q. Okay. A. Okay? Then we increase that level so that that could be put into a tablet or a capsule or in a cosmetic or whatever, and it has a benefit. Does it rise to the level of a drug claim? Probably not. Would it be beneficial? Probably would. Would it hurt anybody? That's the first rule. No. Then why not do it. i guess I'm just a stupid Texan, but it makes sense to me and evidently it makes 5 (Pages 17 to 20) For The Record, Inc.

Now I'm going to look to see are those 10 preparing nutraceuticals or pharmaceuticals, you need to 10 dangerous and, if they are dangerous, at what level, 1 I make sure that it's safe? 11 because a lot of things can be harmless at a lower level 12 A. Dh-huh. 12 and very dangerous at too much. 13 Q. And how do you go about doing that? 13 So -- and then other times the active chemical 14 A. Well, the first thing we look at is the herb 14 that we find in an herb and the customer wants to use 15 itself. And there is data published, easily found, 15 another herb, are they compatible. One could negate the 16 that tells you exactly what's in it. Beyond that, it 16 properties of the other, so we have to determine that. 17 tells you what it should do, what properties that 17 And there also the data tells us what level it's 18 chemical would have if used externally or internally. 18 nonnalIy used. 19 That's published. It's usually backed up by clinical 19 So -- so -- and it wil tell you the whole herb 20 data. 20 or the extracted herb or the concentrated herb. 21 Does that clinical data rise to the level that 21 And so all that data is published. It's 22 the Federal Trade Commission would say it substantiates 22 published in the PDR. It's published in the German 23 the claim? Maybe not. But there certainly is data, 23 monographs, the Chinese monographs, the 24 and it tells exactly what this should do and at what 24 British Pharmacopoeia. 25 leveL. 25 A lot more herbs are used by the rest of the 22 24 1 Q.

It's an i 4 more hype, and that does occur, so we want to make sure 15 to get rid of 15 international compilation of almost any chemical that the hype. 16 you could think offor any use, and it tells you what 16 Q. And how do you do that? i 7 it is, what the history of it is, what studies have 17 A.

I've -- off 1 3 you're not doing yourself any favor. Y oulre not only 3 4 shooting yourself in the foot; you're slitting your own 4 5 throat. This is the surest way in the world to make 5 6 sure that product idea never sees the light of day. 6 7 Keep it simple. 7 8 Q. And why do you -- well, can you just elaborate 8 9 why you say that they'd be shooting themselves in the 9 10 foot? 10 11 A. Because I know how our government views this I I 12 sort of thing. 12 13 Q. How do we -- can you just tell me how we view 13 14 that sort of thing? 14 15 A. Well, you have to be -- a study was done by 15 16 Tufts University for the FDA, what is the average cost 16 17 of a new drug approval, how long does it take average 17 18 and how much does it cost. I can remember when it cost 18 19 a thousand bucks, but I'm an old man. Today the study 19 20 found out five years and $ 1.4 billon. 20 21 How much do you have to sell that product for 21 Ire going to gamble? You may not get approved.22 if you 22 23 You may go through phase one, phase two, phase three, 23 24 phase four, any number. How much oversight is enough? 24 25 So the worst thing you could do is get this 25 26 1 approved as a drug, ifthats the product you're trying i 2 to do, do you have that kind of money to gamble. 2 3 Q. But if someone -- but you said if someone calls 3 4 you and they might say something about cancer and your 4 5 advice would be to them -- 5 6 A. Don't ever mention that word to me again or I'm 6 7 going to drop you so fast, it will make your head swim. 7 8 Q. And why is that? 8 9 A. Because I know it's a very negative thing. And 9 10 I can see both sides of the argument. But if it helps 10 1 I them, well, yeah, I understand how you feel about this. 11 12 The problem is that the public's and the 12 13 government's interpretation of the word \"cure\" is 13 14 totally different. To the public, ifit makes me feel 14 15 better psychologically or actually, it's a cure. To the 15 16 government, that's not so. 16 17 Q. Okay. And-- 17 18 A. You might as well be speaking two different 18 19 languages. 19 20 Q. SO in your experience, the government's idea of 20 21 a cure is at a higher level than the average person? 21 22 A. It's at a level that they set. The 22 23 government -- governments set and bureaucracies set 23 24 whatever rules they set. They're doing this as 24 25 Congress dictates them to do or as they understand what 25 Congress dictates them to do. And that's it. That's the rules. I don't agree that wearing a seat belt is necessarly going to save my life, but I'll guarantee you 1 don't want to pay the $200 fine. Q. Okay. So with respect to cancer then, your view is the government doesn't want -- doesn't allow people to say that they have products that cure cancer? A. They have certain rules and they are the police, and you obey the rules. Q. Okay. Well, in your -- is it a laboratory? Is that what you have? A. Yes, that's exactly what it is. Q. In the laboratory do you also -- do you test drugs at all? A. We do test a lot of things. And keep in mind, what's a drug in this countr is usually not a drug in any other countr. The United States is totally at odds with the rest ofthe world because I manufacture -- over half of my business goes overseas, and every country is different. Q. Well, in this country, what is -- what would -\u00ad in your experience, what is considered a drug? A. Well, it's something -- a drug or a pharmaceutical, I mean, that's what the proper name should be. You also use the word \"drug\" for illegal street drugs -\u00ad Q. Right. A. -- so you have to make that -- but the claim is that it cures or helps to cure a disease, and that we just don't do, will not be involved in that. And if we see that one of our customers is doing it, we wil advise them that I would stop doing this if I were you. Q. Well, then in terms of a drug or pharmaceutical and the testing of those, do you test those? Do you test drugs in your lab? that chemical compound that is in that herb or that food is actually there and what the level is. A. We test to see if If you're going to say it in your documents, which they prepare their own labels from that, then they need to have that information. Q. And so you would provide them with a written statement -\u00ad A. It has so much of this chemical compound in it, and we have certified that, usually done with a certificate of analysis, and we prepare the certificate of analysis. Now, keep in mind all these -- no other country has nutraceuticals, only the USA, so in foreign 7 (Pages 25 to 28) For The Record, Inc.

Dews 2/11/2009 29 1 1 countries we have to submit the documents for a new drug 2 approval in their country according to their 2 3 regulations. They're not interested in ours. 3 4 As a matter of fact, you insult them to say that 4 5 they don't know what they're doing. 5 6 6 Q. Well, have you ever conducted any controlled 7 studies at your -- 7 8 A. Not in a clinical -- I'm not a clinician. i 8 9 don't practice medicine. i don't practice any part of 9 10 healthcare itself. I'm interested in making the product 10 11 and trying to make sure that it's probably safe for its 1 1 12 intended use. 12 13 Q. Okay. Are you involved in the labeling of the 13 14 products? 14 15 A. Very seldom. And we prefer not to. i try to do 15 16 that as best i can for my wife's company, and sometimes 16 17 we wil help to find a printer who can print the labels 17 18 and we try to go through the -- I'm very familiar with 18 19 Title 21 of the congressional Federal Register and i 19 20 have to know that and i generally know it better than 20 21 most of the people inspecting me because I've been at it 21 22 longer. 22 23 Q. And you mentioned before you provide a 23 24 certification for the products you -- 24 25 A. The certificate of analysis, depending on what 25 30 1 1 each country requires. 2 Q. Do you maintain those records? 2 ,..J A. Yeah. 3 4 Q. And how long do you maintain records for? 4 5 A. You keep records forever. 5 6 6 Q. Okay. 7 A. You keep samples of every batch of every product 7 8 and every ingredient that you produce yourself because 8 we do that, we make some of 9 the ingredients themselves, 9 10 and extraction is a perfect example. But those samples 10 1 1 are kept for six years because most of the dating we put 1 1 12 is five years. 12 13 Now, i know that dating is not required on a 13 14 nutraceutIcal in the United States, but it is in the 14 15 rest of the world, and nothing is sold only in the 15 16 United States anymore. 16 17 Q. SO dating, what does that refer to? 17 18 A. You put a date, best before, and usually we use 18 19 five years. And then the Title 21 says whatever date 19 20 you put plus a year, and that's six years. 20 21 Q. And so that's what you put on the certification 21 22 that you send to the -- to the -- 22 23 A. That it has been, we've done an analysis, the 23 24 active ingredient that we're suggesting you could put on 24 25 the label has been analyzed in our laboratory, and we 25 8 (Pages 29 to 32) 31 can certify that it's there and we can certify as to all the other physical characteristics. Q. Okay. Well, as I mentioned before, this is a case against a company called Daniel Chapter One -\u00ad A. Uh-huh. Q. -- correct? Are you familar with that company? A. No. Not until this came up. Q. Are you familiar with the owner of the company, James Feijo? A. Never heard of him. Q. Or Patricia Feijo? A. No. i think they talked to me on the telephone since this has come up. Q. Okay. A. That was my first time i ever heard of them. Q. Was there a reason specifically why you were retained as an expert in this case? A. Not a lot of companies do this. And you wonder, well, why do you do this, why don't you -- it's -- the industry in this country has moved to the point some years ago that the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare industry is pretty well dominated by the big international conglomerates. The little guy is really just not a player anymore. 32 Well, if you're going to be a little guy, what can you do. Well, when physicians began to ask for me for -- they said, You know, we want vitamin C tablets. I said, Why don't you send them to the health food store, or even the pharmacy has a department that has that. And the answer was: We want pharmaceutical quality control in these types of products. We want to know that it goes through a more rigorous manufacturing and quality control and quality assurance. Well, we were already making pharmaceuticals, so we never really changed anything. Now, this did not make us very competitive in the nutraceutical field because we're competing against companies that don't do that. Interesting enough, since the FDA put in their new GMPs, our business has shot up a thousand percent. Q. And what's a GMP? A. Good manufacturing practices. Q.Oh. A. These are the steps that are required to assure the quality and that the product is made the way it should be. And actually they call it now CGMPs, current good manufacturing practices, because they do change. And I know we have to do certificates of free For The Record, Inc.

They -- one of the times that Mr. Turner 24 25 or another attorney from his offce was asking me 25 10 (Pages 37 to 40) 39 questions about this and I was responding, they got on the line and introduced themselves.

SO if 16 discuss that. 16 See, I do have them. 17 A. Okay. I'm going to tell you I've been around 17 Q. Yes. You got them right. i 8 this long enough, I know what -- how these things go. 18 So why don't we talk about first burdock root. 19 I know what the herbs are. I know what they've 19 What is burdock root? 20 been recommended before officially. I do not know what 20 A. Burdock root used in suffcient quantities can 21 they have -- what you allege they said. 21 give a laxative action, although used in less it would 22 For me to read that would be sheer speculation 22 not. It's used for inflammation. 23 on my part. I'm not an expert in marketing, nor am I an 23 As I recall, I think the German monograph makes 24 expert on how the rules are promulgated by the 24 the statement \"used for purifying the blood.\" Well, I 25 Federal Trade Commission, and so therefore, I'm not 25 suppose that would be true in Germany but not in this 42 44 1 interested. I'm not going to read what you have said 1 country, although I think it's in the PDR also, the 2 you charged them with. 2 herbal PDR. 3 Q. All right. Well, let's see if we can do it 3 So those are the general uses for it, to reduce 4 without the exhibit. Okay? 4 inflammation and that sort of thing. 5 A. Right. 5 Q. Do you know whether burdock root has ever been 6 Q. We'll make our best effort. 6 used in the treatment of cancer? 7 Well, first of all, you said you are aware of 7 A. I'm sure it has and I'm sure it was used 8 informally. It could have been used by a medical 8 what's in 7 Herb Formula. 9 Can you tell me what's in it? 9 practitioner, but I don't know that they would be too 10 A. Yeah. I think -- and I may not get these in the 10 verbal about the fact. 11 correct order, ifthere is an order -- there is one 1 I Q. Are you aware of any studies that have ever been the 12 done on burdock root and its treatment of cancer? 13 Rumex family. We refer to it as dock or yellow dock. 13 A. I don't recall seeing cancer mentioned 14 Herbs have a lot of different names, even 14 specifically, only the general properties. 15 different plant genus names from one country to 15 Q. And sheep sorrel you mentioned. 16 another. 16 A. Uh-huh. 17 And it's generally used for inflammation. It 17 Q. Can you tell me again what sheep sorrel is? 18 does help to reduce inflammation. It does have a very 18 A. It's in the Rumex family. It's also referred to 19 mild laxative action if you take enough of it. If you i 9 as dock. It's also antiinflammatory. It helps as a 12 called sorreL. And this is a -- it's a member of it, it doesn't have any such 20 diuretic to get rid of excess moisture content. 21 action. And mainly that's what it's used for. 2 i You could probably make the stretch to say, 22 Now, this -- do you want me to take them one at 22 well, with cancer don't you have excess fluids. I 23 a time? 23 suppose, but I've never seen it specifically stated that 24 Q. Well, first I'm asking you to tell me what's in 24 way. 25 7 Herb. 20 don't take enough of 25 Q. Well, have you ever seen any studies done on 11 (Pages 41 to 44) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Dews 2/11/2009 1 sheep sorrel -\u00ad 2 A. That it reduces inflammation. 3 I'm sorr. 4 Q. -- studies of sheep sorrel in connection with 5 the treatment of cancer? 6 A. It -- only that it reduces inflammation. 7 Q. And so can you say what kind of studies have you 8 seen in connection with sheep sorrel? 9 A. Yes. It's in the PDR for herbal drugs. It's in 10 the German monographs. It's in quite a few books that I1 are published for physicians' references. 12 Physicians are very interested in this sort of 13 subject because it's become very popular, so their 14 patients are asking for this. 15 It's in the -- I believe it's in the 16 Chinese Medica which is the official, and so -- and in 17 the British Pharmacopoeia it's listed. 18 Q. Are you familar with whether sheep sorrel has 19 ever been used in folk -- let's say, as a folk remedy 20 for cancer? 21 A. Yeah. Now, there, any of these seven herbs 22 could have been used folk-wise for that, but not 23 offcially, not bluntly. 24 Q. Well, when you say \"not offcially,\" you mean in 25 terms of the scientific studies done? 1 A. Right. Generally they speak in terms -- anyone 2 who's a health practitioner, whether they're a physician 3 or even a naturopath, they're well aware that certainly 4 in many conditions which might be considered to be 5 diseases there are symptoms that -- such as excess fluid 6 retention in soft tissue, that some of these things wil 7 reduce the inflammation in soft tissue, but they're not 8 going to say it helps with cancer, other than folk 9 medicine. 10 Q. Okay. 11 Okay. The other -- the other component -\u00ad 12 another component is Siberian ginseng or ginseng. 13 A. Dh-huh. 14 Q. Can you describe what that is? 15 A. Sure. Sure. It's -- I'm trying to remember 16 the plant genus name, but anyway, it's-\u00ad 17 Eleutherococcus. It is used mainly to -- for energy. 18 It's an energizing -- it contains chemicals that tend 19 to energize. But I've never seen it stated that it 20 helps with cancer, just that it energizes. 21 Certainly if you're on chemotherapy or 22 something of that, your energy levels are pretty low, 23 so it might be beneficiaL. It certainly won't hurt. 24 It might help. 25 Q. Are you familar with the statement that 12 (Pages 45 to 48) 45 47 I Siberian ginseng produces saponins or -\u00ad 2 A. Yeah. The saponins are plant hormones, 3 phytohormones, and almost any food has these things in 4 it, and they have effects upon the body depending upon 5 which one you're using. 6 Q. Would they have effects on tumors? 7 A. Might. Certainly a tumor would require that a 8 lot of moisture go into that area and maybe more than 9 the surrounding tissue. Therefore, if you were to 10 reduce the moisture content, it might, it could be 11 helpful, but I've never seen it stated exactly that 12 way. 13 Q. Have you ever seen any studies that have found 14 that Siberian ginseng reduces tumors? 15 A. No. Just that it reduces in -- or it gives a 16 person more energy and which I think is mainly what it's 17 used for. 18 Most of these herbs have a lot of different uses 19 that have been used. Some of them were, you know, like 20 you say, native or traditional and some were studies, 21 and they tend to get kind of mixed up. 22 Q. Okay. Another component is cat's claw, as you 23 mentioned. 24 A. Dh-huh. 25 Q. And what is cat's claw? 46 48 1 A. eat's claw's plant genus name is -- oh, what is 2 that? Tomentosa is the second name. I can't think of 3 the first name now. I didn't get enough coffee this 4 morning. 5 Q. Okay. 6 A. But anyway, it's used in South America. It's 7 supposed to support the immune system. 8 Q. Have you seen studies that have found cat's -\u00ad 9 A. The PDR says so and also give the bibliography 10 ofthe studies. 11 Q. Have you ever seen any of those studies? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And do you know what kind of studies those were? 14 Were they double-blind studies? 15 A. Most of them were more single-blind, although 16 some were double-blind, and I'd have to go back and look 17 at it to see exactly which ones were and which ones 18 weren't. 19 But yes, it does seem to have an effect upon 20 supporting the immune system. 21 Could it be used by itself? No. Of course not. 22 Would it be helpful? It might would. 23 Q. Well, when you say \"could it be used by itself,\" 24 you mean to treat cancer? 25 A. For any particular condition, and I'm not For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 2/11/2009 49 51 1 singling out cancer. i 2 Q. Why do you say it couldn't be used by itself? 2 .. ,) A. If the only thing it's doing is supporting the 3 4 immune system, the word \"support\" itself means it has to 4 5 work with something else, so that right there would 5 6 negate such a claim. 6 7 Q. Another component is slippery elm. 7 8 A. Slippery elm again helps -- it's emollient; that 8 9 is, it helps tissue. It helps to get the moisture, 9 10 excess moisture, down. It's very soothing to the lower 10 1 i tract. 11 12 It's very high in sugars, and sugars are very 12 13 good. And there's quite a few sugars; there's not just 13 14 one. And that's -- it's used a lot in cough syrups 14 15 because it helps to get the excess fluids out, and so 15 16 it -- that's its purpose. 16 17 Q. Have you ever seen any studies showing that it 17 18 can help with, for example, stomach cancer? 18 19 A. No. I've never seen that specifically in those 19 20 words. 20 21 Q. Well, in other words? 21 22 A. Well, if it reduces inflammation of the 22 23 stomach, whatever the condition is, it might be 23 24 helpfuL. 24 25 25Q. But as far as you're aware, you've never seen 50 1 1 any actual scientifc studies done that would show that 2 it's helpful in any disease. 2 3 A. No. Helpful maybe, but curing, no. 3 4 Q. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. 4 5 Another component is watercress, and what would 5 6 that be used for? 6 7 A. Watercress is the flower nasturtium and so of 7 8 the mustard family, and it's used mainly to reduce 8 9 inflamation. 9 10 Q. Are there any studies, scientific studies 10 11 11 conducted on -\u00ad 12 A. There are studies on all of these but 12 13 not usually pertaining to any particular disease but 13 14 only to their overall effect upon the body. 14 15 Q. And in your business you have to be familiar 15 16 with those studies? 16 17 A. Oh, yeah. The first thing I've got to do. 17 18 It was real interesting when we started doing 18 19 the Chinese herbs because they have a totally different 19 20 way of looking at healthcare particularly, and it 20 21 sounded so foreign when the first thing I had to 21 22 understand is how does that relate to western medicine. 22 23 And as I got into it, the only difference was the 23 24 terminology or most of the differences was in the 24 25 terminology. There's some things that are different, 25 you know. But they talk about the upper burner. Well, that's your sinuses and your lungs. The lower burner is your stomach, you know. But on first when you read the names, you know, that -- what are they talking about. Then as you dig into it, oh. And this is the sort of thing -- maybe this is why I ended up doing what I do. I love to study and learn things. Q. Well, as we go on, the last component is turkey rhubarb root and -\u00ad A. Rhubarb used in sufficient quantities has a laxative action. And if it's low quantities, it wouldn't, enough, it would. It depends on the person. It depends on the person's psyche at the time that they -- or physiological makeup at the time that they use it, but it does -- and it is listed also as a blood purifier, and i guess if you get a mild laxative action, that could be said to be one way to do it. Q. One way to do what? A. If you remove excess feces from your intestinal tract, that probably would help to purify your system. Q. Okay. Well, have you ever seen any studies of rhubarb root as it relates to treating cancer? A. Only in a native, you know, and in traditionaL. Q. Traditional medicine? A. Could you call it medicine? Q. No. So when you say in the native folklore -- is that what you're saying? A. Yeah. Q. But in terms of the scientific studies, have you ever seen any on rhubarb root? A. Not really. Q. Okay. A. The only thing it could mention is purifYing, but it wouldn't specifically say for any disease. Q. SO what would be your opinion if a company were to make a claim that all of these herbs or in combination actually could help to treat cancer? Would you agree with that statement? A. Well, certainly ifsomeone were to ask me that, number one, I don't advise on that subject other than maybe my wife, but i would say, If I were you, I wouldn't go there. That's just like you can get into your car and you can drive from here to another city and drive a hundred miles an hour and not get caught and not get a ticket, but does that change the law. in were you, i wouldn't do that. You're just asking for a problem. 13 (Pages 49 to 52) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 52 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Dews 2/11/2009 53 1 1 Q. Well, is it your view that there's any -- is 2 there any truth in the statement that these herbs taken 2 3 together could treat cancer? 3 4 A. Well, remember, you're talking about officially 4 5 or in the opinion of the person -- 5 6 Q. Just your opinion, not offciaIly. 6 7 A. In my opinion, I don't know that it would rise 7 8 to that level, but I don't know that it would be 8 9 detrimental to use it. 9 io Q. Okay. And just for the record, are you familiar 10 11 with the product Bio*Shark? 11 12 A. Never heard of it. 12 13 But it's the typical kind of name they usually 13 14 would use for chondroitin -- let's see ifI can spell 14 15 it. C-H-O-N-D-R-O-I-T-I-N -- sulfate, just like the 15 16 mineral, S-U-L-F-A-T-E. 16 17 This is a -- it's a very complex carbohydrate 17 18 and it's actually a protein-carbohydrate complex. It 18 19 exists in many things, but it's particularly high in 19 20 shark cartilage. And it does help your body to produce 20 21 hyaluronic acid. 21 22 And studies have shown that it does help to 22 23 lubricate the joints, and certainly being 73 years old, 23 24 I have a need to lubricate my joints. I use it. It 24 25 works. It's not a drug. It's not approved as a cure 25 54 for anything, but then it's not curing, is it? It's not 2 getting at the cause of the arthritis; it's helping with 2 3 the results of it. 3 4 Q. WeIl, are you familiar with the use of shark 4 1 1 5 cartiage in the treatment of cancer? 5 6 A. No. I've heard that, but I've never really seen 6 7 any data. 7 8 Now, there may be some out there, but generally 8 9 when I see those, a mention of a disease, particularly 9 10 cancer or weight loss, I shy away with whatever it's 10 1 1 saying about it. 11 12 Q. And why is that? 12 13 A. Because I know it's just going to get you in 13 14 trouble. 14 15 Q. Okay. WeIl, what about in terms of the truth of 15 16 the abilty to, you know, affect cancer? 16 17 A. I think at some point, whether you're doing what 17 18 I do in making the products or doing what they're doing 18 19 in marketing the products, what are you here for? Are 19 20 you here to preach a sermon of what you believe? Are 20 21 you here to help the public? Are you here to make a 21 22 living? 22 23 1 think number one it would be to make a 23 24 living, number two and almost as close is helping the 24 25 public, but that doesn't leave any room for preaching 25 14 (Pages 53 to 56) 55 sermons. Q. Well, let's see. Well, are you familar with the product GDU? A. No. I don't have a clue what that is. Q. Are you familar with the product called BioMixx? A. No. Q. When you went back to look at the Web site, did you -- to look at the herbs in 7 Herb Formula, did you get any information about the quantities of each component within it? A. I don't recall that being in there. And since I had put the seven herbs together for Mr. Maclean, I knew what the quantities are. Q. Well, what are the quantities? A. Oh, I'd have to go back and look now. I don't have that in front of me, but I'm guessing that he continued to use the same proportions as they did before, which -- I also told him where to find the references. Hey, look them up for yourself. Q. SO did you have -- do you have records regarding the transaction with Dr. Maclean? A. It's so far back, I'd have to dig to find them, but I probably could. I don't know. I really -- having been in business 35 years, I have a lot of records. 56 I've run out of -- i have to build buildings to store them, and a lot of them 1 just throwaway. Dr. Maclean told you what the 7 Herb was going to be used for? Q. Do you remember if A. No. And I don't want to know. Q. Okay. A. That's not what I do. Q. Did he ever come back to you and say, Can you just test the 7 Herb to make sure I have the components correct? A. As I said, he said -- after 1 told him where to get the herbs and where to find the references on them since he didn't want me to make the product, I made up a few small but just the herbs in the right proportions in little bags, and I said, if you'll take this and put it in water and heat the water and brew a tea, then you can make the product, but know, ifI were you, I'd add a preservative to it, you don't want this stuff mildewing on you, and advised him. But ifhe ever tried to tell me any disease state, 1 would shut him up in a New York minute and say, I don't want to hear it. 1 don't go there. Q. Well, you advised him to make it as a tea; is that right? A. Oh, yeah. For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921 -5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 2/11/2009 57 59 I Q. And why as a tea? 2 A. Because he said he wanted to make a liquid. A 3 liquid is a tea. It depends on what you call it. 1 A. I've never seen any, and if anyone tried to 2 present them to me, I'd do the same thing I did here a 3 while ago. I really don't think it's a good idea for me 4 Q. SO do you know, was he providing it as an actual 4 to look at that. 5 like a powder substance or actual tea bags? 5 Q. And what about if there are any studies on 6 A. It's my understanding that he was brewing a 6 whether it prevents cancer? 7 liquid of some sort. 7 A. I guess a lot of things could, but I don't know 8 I think he wanted to test the herbs in those 8 of any studies. 9 combinations to see if it achieved the result that he 9 Q. And are you aware of whether there are any 10 was tring to get, and as I said, I don't want to know 10 studies showing that 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumor II what results you're trying to get. 11 formation? 12 Q. Well, could you use the combination of herbs as 12 A. No. I had never heard of the 7 Herb Formula 13 just something to put into like a drink? 13 until this, this came up, so I really haven't had time 14 A. Vh-huh, you could. 14 to delve into it. And besides that, that's not what I 15 Q. Does it have to be -- 15 do. I'm busy doing what I do. 16 A. It's just a food. It doesn't have to be a 16 Q. Well, with regard to the herbs in I 7 drug. 17 7 Herb Formula, are you familar with whether there are 18 Q. Does it have to be heated to get any effects? 18 any studies that say there's anticancer activity in any 19 A. Well, if you want to get the chemicals out of 19 of those components? 20 the herb -- remember, they're bound up there with the 20 A. No studies, no. And you know, there might be 21 fiber and other naturally occurring compounds. If you 21 some mention it might. Some physicians might have 22 want to -- you know, that's the first thing we have to 22 indicated it. I'm not sure whether it was a 23 do is, when we look at the herb, what's in there that 23 double-blind study or what because I really didn't delve 24 we're trying to get out and what is it soluble in it. 24 into it. 25 That's how you separate it. 25 Q. And then are you familar with the studies that 58 60 1 Fiber is not soluble in water, not even hot 1 are done to get drugs to market? 2 water. 2 A. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've done it. 3 Q. Okay. 3 Q. Can you just describe generalIy -\u00ad 4 A. That's pharacology. 4 A. It varies from country to country, but generally 5 Q. Besides looking at the Web site to go over the 5 you get a medical school at one of the universities, and 6 seven herbs in here, did you read anything else in 6 I've participated in a lot of them. 7 preparation for today? 7 i did the only one done on DHEA as a matter of a 8 A. I think you asked that and I've answered it. I 8 fact. i did that for Southwestern MedicaL. And we did 9 made a point, I only want to see the herbs. I want to 9 the study. i 0 make sure it's the same herbs that I remember. i 0 And it has to be controlled. You have to set 11 Q. Okay. But I think in your report did you go 11 it up to where the physicians don't know which is 12 back -- you mentioned the German monographs and 12 which. You've got a placebo. Sometimes there's a 13 other -- 13 triple blind where you might have three things. One of 14 A. I look at each herb, yeah, what's the herb, 14 them wil be the actual chemical itself. At that point 15 what are the different references that have been 15 it's not a drug because it hasn't gone through the 16 published on it, what do they use it for and what it's 16 studies. It's in the process yet. And then you make 17 been indicated for offcially and unoffcially, at what 17 up a placebo which looks exactly like it. And the 18 levels. Again, all that information is readily 18 only -- and you have to label it for a study only and 19 available. 19 not to be sold. 20 Q. SO can I ask you, to your knowledge, are there 20 And the only distinction between the placebo and 21 any controlled studies regarding 7 Herb Formula and its 21 the real thing is a lot number. And the only person who 22 effectiveness in treating cancer? 22 can know which is which within the physicians' side or 23 A. I've never seen any. 23 the university or the physicians is one secretary. We 24 Q. Have you ever seen any studies that would say 24 prefer not to have the physicians know because we don't 25 that 7 Herb Formula is effective in curing cancer? 25 want them to begin to see results that are not really 15 (Pages 57 to 60) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 2/11/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Dews 61 63 1 there because they want to see the results and which is 2 the placebo. 3 In my company, I don't know. I have one 4 secretary that knows which is which that keeps up with 5 that. 6 And then you compile the data that you got from 7 the study, depending on how many respondents, how many 8 people were in the study, and you analyze that data and 9 then you say, welI, this many under this lot number this 10 is the results we saw and under this lot number this is II the results you saw. Then we can say okay. Now, are 12 you through, there's no more data coming? No. That's 13 it. Okay. Now we can determine which is which and 14 compile the results. 15 Q. And your company has participated in studies 16 like that? 17 A. Oh, yeah. Yeah. 18 Q. In what kind of studies? 19 A. We made the active component. We made the 20 placebo. We were asked to do this. We did it. There's 21 not a lot of companies that do what I do. 22 Q. Okay. And what kind of -- you mentioned DHEA 23 was -\u00ad 24 A. Dehydroepiandrosterone. It's one of those 25 phytohormones. It's -- it's a precursor to the anabolic 62 64 1 hormones. It could be anyone of them. 2 And that's -- they say, WelI, boy, that's the 3 latest thing out. I said, That's old hat. Good Lord, I 4 did that study twenty-some-odd years ago. 5 You don't know what it's going to turn into. It 6 depends on how your body handles it. 7 Understand something, which is a misconception 8 everybody has, including the government, no vitamin, no 9 mineral, no drug, none of them do anything by 10 themselves. Your body uses that to perform certain 1 1 functions, mixes that or combines it with or metabolizes 12 it with something else, and that has an effect that 13 leads to a structure/function claim. 14 So getting the idea of, oh, welI, yeah, this 15 drug and it does -- no, it doesn't. It helps your body 16 to do it. A drug does that and so does a nutraceutical. 17 The difference is, a drug you can make a disease-curing 18 claim, a nutraceutical you can't. 19 Q. 7 Herb Formula, is that a nutraceutical? 20 A. Oh, yeah. It would be classified as such, if 21 you kept aII your labeling and aII your advertising 22 within line. 23 Q. And has your company ever done any studies -\u00ad 24 you mentioned the double-blind studies -- with regard to 25 cancer drugs have you been involved? 16 (Pages 61 to 64) A. No. We haven't been asked to do that. We 2 don't do anything unless we're asked. And usually it's 3 the university that's doing the study. We're just 4 supplying the necessary materials to do it with and the 5 control. 6 Q. And in terms -\u00ad 7 A. And I have to fight with the physicians 8 sometimes. I'm not going to tell you which is which. 1 9 Q. Well, when you reach -- before you reach the 10 stage of giving actual drugs, what -- are you familar 11 with the stages that come before that, you know, the 12 phase one, phase two trials? 13 A. It could run through as many as four phases and 14 which is why our heaIthcare is so high, and so you see 15 why people are turning to nutraceuticals, and a lot of 16 them are old pharmaceuticals that are no longer 17 pharmaceuticals. 18 Q. And in terms of phase one/phase two animal 19 studies, are you -- is it your opinion that findings in 20 animal studies can be extrapolated to -\u00ad 21 A. In this country -\u00ad 22 Q. -- to humans? 23 A. Oh, I'm sorr. I know the answer and I 24 apologize. 25 Q. Okay. 1 A. In this countr, animal studies are no longer 2 the end usable result. You tend to go to human studies. 3 You might start with animal studies. You want to see, 4 welI, you know, looking at this chemical structure and a 5 potential for harm -- and that's the study of 6 pharmacology. And you see why 1 can't get involved with 7 too many things, because this is diffcult enough in 8 itsel f. 9 Q. Right. 10 A. -- looking at that, I think there's a potential 11 here for har. 12 Well, how much should I use? Well, we don't 13 know yet, do we? 14 So let's tr it on animals first. We can begin 15 to get some feedback of if it's harmful and what levels 16 to use. If we kil the animal, we know that's too much. 17 Ifwe get no results, that's too little. 18 So we begin to zero in on what is safe for an 19 animaL. Now, with that data, we can take that and see 20 whether we want to go to phase two or phase three or 21 whatever phase, because you may have several animal 22 studies, and to see, well, now let's try it on humans. 23 You know, we have a prett good idea of what's too much, 24 what's too little, and the fact that it's safe, it 25 appears to be safe up to this point, and now we can For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Dews 2/11/2009 65 67 1 begin -- so by the time the humans actually get it, 2 we've already done that safety. 3 Q. Okay. And so that now it's not proper to take 4 results from animal studies to say that it works in 5 humans the -\u00ad 6 A. As a rule, that's not done -- in other countries 7 it's still done -- because a funny thing has occurred 8 here. People wil spend whatever for their health. 9 They'll go in debt, they'll sell everyhing they've got 10 to stay alive a little bit longer. 11 At what point does the cost override the 12 benefit. And that's a tough calL. I'm not saying that 13 anybody is right in this. It's a tough calL. Other 14 countries say the main thing is for the health of the 15 public. In this country, well, I'm not saying it's 16 right or wrong. I'm saying that's the way it is. 17 your knowledge of herbs, areQ. Well, in terms of 18 you familar with the -- with turmeric? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Or which is -- what's the active component in 21 that? 22 A. The active chemical is curcumin. 23 Q. Yes. 24 A. Curcumin is very good at reducing inflammation, 25 very, very good, and that's why the Indians put so much 66 68 1 of it in all their foods. It's also why it's a main 2 thing used in allopathic medicine. It does reduce .. .J inflammation. 4 Now, can you say that reducing inflammation is a 5 cure for any particular disease? No. But could you say 6 that it might be helpful? Yeah, you could probably make 7 that statement. 8 Q. And are there studies that have shown that 9 curcumin is helpful? 10 A. Yeah. It is -- of all the -- and by the way, if 11 you think that all of pharmaceuticals -- and I'm talking 12 about prescription -- are not herbs, you're wrong. A 13 lot of them are, and boy, I mean there's a list a mile 14 long. 15 And you know, the point is, you're interested in 16 a certain chemical compound, and where you get it really 17 doesn't matter as long as you've got it. You can make 18 it synthetically. You can find it in plants. These 19 plants develop these compounds. 20 So yes, it has effect. Generally when we look 21 at that, we're not interesting in curing cancer, we're 22 interested in reducing inflammation. There's a 23 distinction. 24 Q. Well, with curcumin, have you seen actual 25 studies on humans using curcumin? 1 A. Yes. There are quite a few studies. It does 2 reduce inflammation. 3 If someone were really doing a study or if I was 4 involved in a study and someone says, Well, we want to 5 do a study on curing cancer, I'll say, Well, then count 6 me out. Because I think you have to star with you're 7 trying to work upon the symptoms of the disease. We're 8 not trying to cure the disease by working on a symptom 9 of the disease. There's a big difference. 10 So if you want to do this study on curcumin to 11 see if it does indeed reduce inflammation and to what 12 degree and at what level can you get too much, if any, 13 and at what level is too low, well, I talked about this 14 a while ago, then count me in, but when you star trying 15 to cure a disease when you haven't even figured out how 16 to do anything about the symptom, I know I'm dealing 17 with a bunch of amateurs. 18 MS. PAYNTER: Okay. Again, I'm just going to 19 step out one second. I'll be right back. We're almost 20 finished I think. 21 (Recess) 22 MS. PAYNTER: So I'm going to withdraw Exhibit 23 Number 1 -\u00ad 24 THE WITNESS: Okay. 25 MS. PAYNTER: -- and I would like to make 1 Exhibit Number 1 Mr. Dews' expert report. 2 (Dews Deposition Exhibit Number 1, Report of 3 Expert Witness Jim Dews, was marked for 4 identification.) 5 BY MS. PAYNTER: 6 Q. SO, Mr. Dews, I'm handing you Exhibit Number 1, 7 which is a copy of your expert report. 8 A. Let me get my glasses. 9 Here we go. Let's see what it is. 10 Yeah, this is -- this is -- was answering 11 questions which they asked me over the telephone. 12 Q. Okay. 13 A. Yeah. 14 Q. If you can go to page 7, please. 15 A. Okay. 16 Okay. 17 Q. And I just wanted to ask you questions just 18 regarding some things that are on here. 19 It says you're being compensated $35.00 per 20 hour? 2 i A. Yes. Vh-huh. 22 Q. Or 280 per day plus expenses; correct? 23 A. Right. 24 Q. And in section in it says \"Materials 25 Considered. \" 17 (Pages 65 to 68) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter Onei et 01. Dews 2/11/2009 69 71 1 Do you see that? i monographs are published in that book. And the reason 2 A. Okay. Section-- 2 why someone had to do that is because in Germany they 3 Q. On page 7? 3 speak and read German. 4 A. On page 7? 4 Q. Okay. 5 Q. Yes. 5 A. In the United -- it is published -- it was 6 A. 1 don't see that. 6 published in German and then republished in English so 7 Q. Do you see at the bottom? the world could read what they're saying. 7 the rest of 8 A. Oh, this. I'm looking at the wrong number. 8 Q. Okay. The next item is British Pharmacopoeia, 9 Q. Page 7, please. 9 and you have a notation here, \"Burdock root is 10 A. Sorr. you're in England.\" 10 recognized as a drug if 11 A. Right. And there are quite a few of 11 Q. That's okay. the herbs 12 MR. TURNER: It's I think here (indicating). 12 in the seven herbs that are. 13 THE WITNESS: Now we got it. I'll keep those in 13 And the offcial listing of the 14 order. Yeah. Okay. 14 British Pharmacopoeia is the Martindale. It's not the 15 BY MS. PAYNTER: 15 same Marindale you attorneys use. And that is the 16 Q. And it says \"Materials Considered.\" i 6 British Pharmacopoeia, and it's published by a 1 7 Do you see that? 17 publishing company but in connection with the British 1 8 A. Yes. Uh-huh. 18 government. And it lists -- there's a lot of herbs 19 Q. And it says that you reviewed the German 19 listed in there and indications and uses and 20 monographs on herbs -- 20 contraindications and how a physician would use it. 21 A. Right. 21 Q. And again, it would be in connection with saying 22 Q. -- in the 7 Herb Formula. 22 treats inflammation or supports immune system? 23 A. Yeah. 23 A. Right. As a rule, that's what you do. You-\u00ad 24 Q. And what is the German monographs on herbs? 24 and a physician -- you're not going to go to that 25 A. Okay. The German government -- herbal medicine 25 physician and he's going to pull out one pill and here, 70 72 1 is -- remained official there even when it stopped being take this pil and it wil cure your disease. He has to 1 2 here. And it's, according to the German government or 2 use all of the tools at his disposaL. .. ,) their variation of the FDA, what can be used by a 3 How am I going to go about alleviating your 4 practitioner and what claims can be made for it. And 4 symptoms? Well, reducing the inflammation is certainly 5 that's -- those are the official laws in that country 5 one of the things that you would do, but it doesn't cure 6 for using these types of products. The indications are 6 the disease by itself. 7 spelled out. 7 Q. Okay. Well, in the British Pharmacopoeia, do 8 8 you recall all of the herbs are listed in there? Q. In reviewing the herbs in 7 Herb Formula as 9 identifed in the German monographs, were there any 9 A. Most of them are listed. There are a few that 10 indications for use in cancer treatment? 10 are maybe not as popular in some countries, and so they 11 A. I don't -- I don't -- generally speaking, in 1 1 tend to get -- not make it. 12 most countries that use herbal medicine, you just don't 12 Q. Okay. 13 see that kind of claim. You see it reduces 13 A. The next -- oh, excuse me. Go ahead. 14 inflammation. It helps to purify the blood, you see 14 Q. The next one then, the USP or the 15 that. You'll see -- but they don't mention a disease as 15 United States Pharmacopeia. 16 a rule. 16 A. Right. That's everyhing that's offcially a 17 17 drug. And of course to be offcially a drug you have to Q. Would it -\u00ad 18 A. More the symptoms. 18 treat a disease, and certainly since we don't do that in 19 19 this country with herbs, they're not listed as a drug, Q. SO for example, they might say that one of those 20 components helps reduce tumors? 20 as a cure for any specific disease. 21 A. It helps reduce inflammation. 21 Q. SO the components in 7 Herb are not listed in 22 22 number 4; is that what you're saying? Q. Okay. The next item says \"Herbal Drugs and 23 Phytopharmaceuticals. \" 23 A. Right. It's just I need to look at that to make 24 Do you see that one? 24 sure they're not listed. 25 A. Yeah. And that really is the same. The German 25 Q. I see. 18 (Pages 69 to 72) For The Recordi Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 , Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 2/11/2009 73 75 I Okay. And then number 5, the Complementary and 2 Alternative Physician's Guide, is that an American 3 publication? 4 A. It's American. It's published in America for 5 American physicians. 6 And a lot of physicians are very much interested 7 in this subject now because their patients are demanding 8 it and they see some results. 9 So therefore, they needed a guide, and so a lot i 0 of guides began to be published, and this was one of 11 them. This is a physician's handbook. 12 A medical doctor who says, Well, my patient came 13 in and wanted burdock root. I want to learn all about 14 it. If you look in that reference, it wil tell you 15 everyhing about that herb, every study that's been done 16 on it and exactly what it's indicated for and how to use 17 it and when not to use it. 18 Q. Well, as you say that, in terms of the seven 19 herbs in 7 Herb Formula, are you aware of whether they 20 counteract any pharmaceuticals? 21 A. Not aware of any looking at what I can learn 22 about them. I don't see any problem. As I've repeated, 23 it can't hurt; it might help. 24 Q. Okay. The next thing you looked at were the 25 Physicians' Desk Reference? 1 A. Uh-huh. 2 Q. And what publication is that? 3 A. That's the Physicians' Desk Reference. It is 4 published by Thomson Publishing but with -- under -- in 5 control with, in relation with the government that they 6 do go through there and check everything to make sure 7 that there's no statements made that our regulatory 8 agencies would have a problem with. 9 And there is a PDR for herbal drugs and again, i 0 just like the one above it, the Complementary and 11 Alternative Physician's Guide, everything about it is 12 listed, the active chemical that you're looking for, i 3 what the indications are, what the contraindications 14 are, everyhing, and including the bibliography where 15 you can look up the studies that have been done on it. 16 Q. Okay. Now-\u00ad 17 A. And all seven herbs are in the PDR and one of 18 them says for purifying the blood. 19 Q. Okay. 20 A. 1 suppose a laxative would do that. 21 Q. Well, now, number 7, I'm not sure what this 22 statement means, so can you -\u00ad 23 A. Well, they just asked me in general would you-\u00ad 24 would you agree with the statement that no one could 25 find out about these herbs or the indications. I said 1 that's ridiculous. 2 Q. Oh, okay. 3 A. And the only reason why someone couldn't find it 4 is they never bothered to look. 5 Q. Okay. Okay. 6 A. Of course I guess you would have to ask, well, 7 what are you tring to find. 8 Q. That's true. 9 A. Are we through with that one? 10 Q. Yes. I think we're through with this. Let me 11 just make sure. 12 A. Okay. 13 Q. And I don't recall -- we were talking about 14 Dr. Maclean before. 15 Do you recall what the name of his company is? 16 A. You know, I don't now. It's been a long time, i 7 and he's someone that just suddenly appeared and 18 suddenly disappeared and i never heard from him again. 19 A lot of them do that. 20 Q. Okay. 21 A. They get ahold of my name somehow and say, I 22 heard that you know something about this and I need some 23 help. 24 Q. Did Dr. Maclean contact you in connection with 25 this case? 74 76 i A. He did not. As a rule, someone like that would 2 never, never mention the name of their customer. 3 They're afraid I might try to steal it from them, which 4 I wouldn't, but they don't know that. 5 Q. Okay. 6 A. I don't want the customer. 7 MR. TURNER: Let me just clarify. I don't think 8 he understood the question. 9 MS. PAYNTER: Okay. Go ahead. 10 MR. TURNER: The question you said was did 1 i Dr. Maclean contact you in conjunction with this case. i 2 THE WITNESS: Not in this case, no. No. 13 Never. I haven't even heard from him in, gosh, 14 15-20 years. 15 MS. PAYNTER: Thank you, Jim. 16 THE WITNESS: I'm sorr. 17 BY MS. PAYNTER: 18 Q. That's okay. i 9 Let me just check my last list, and I'll -- I 20 think we're finished, but let me just check. 21 (Pause in the proceedings.) 22 Just -- I just want to ask you, are you 23 familar with what are called conventional cancer 24 treatments? 25 A. Oh, yes. Yes. Very much so. 19 (Pages 73 to 76) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 2/11/2009 77 79 I Q. And just a few would be -- i physicians tended to prescribe their items because they 2 A. Well, it's what's used in this country today, 2 liked them. 3 and that's fine. That's not my field. I'm not a 3 The other group were product-knowledge people 4 clinician. 4 that really, really, really concentrated on 5 Q. Okay. I mean, do you have an opinion as to 5 understanding every word those old men were telling 6 whether those treatments are effective or not or... 6 them and asked questions afterwards. That's what I 7 A. No. I really don't have any -- I guess they 7 did. 8 are. They use them. There must be a reason. 8 And usually those end up being moved to the 9 Q. And going back just to your experience, when did 9 home offce. i didn't want to move up there, and so I io you start working in the pharmaceutical area? 10 ended up being in -- staying in Texas. We had medical I I A. Oh, it must have been 19 -- I worked for a i I diagnostics and pharmaceuticals. i 2 wholesale drg company fresh out of schooL. Gosh, it i 2 I would go into a clinic, put my card in for i 3 would have been late '50s. 13 each of the doctors -- there might be seven doctors -\u00ad 14 Q. And you worked for them as a salesperson at that 14 and go to the lab and start -- and carry two detail 15 time? 15 bags and start detailing the lab technician on how to 16 A. I worked for a wholesale drug company. Then I 16 do the analysis and doing the blood samples and the i 7 went to work as a detail man with the company, and 17 urine samples, and then as the -- and I'd usually get a i 8 they -- there are two kinds of detail men. This is kind 18 pizza or several pizzas, depending on how many i 9 of an inside thing, almost a joke. One kind is what we 19 physicians, and they would wander in during lunchtime 20 call the golf buddy. He's too dumb to ever really 20 and eat pizza and we'd talk about -- now that we talked 21 understand the chemistry. And let me explain that a 21 about diagnosing it, now we're going to talk about 22 little bit further. 22 treating it. 23 As I said, the company I was with at that time, 23 And I did that. And I led the company in sales 24 Wampole Laboratories, was a technology transfer company 24 every year that I was there, 10 or 15 years, because I 25 for MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They 25 worked my butt off and because I love to learn things, 78 80 i had professors who were mostly European phannacologists. i so 1 dug into it. And from that I would get -- became 2 Those were my teachers. 2 very familiar with other detail men, physicians, 3 And what we would do, we would go in for 3 pharmacists, hospitals, and they began to ask me would 4 training sessions. They hire bright, young people that 4 you join us in a new company, which we did, and I 5 they think can do this. And these old professors with 5 fonned the company, got it on its feet, left and 6 their horrible European accents got up there and taught 6 started my own company with the intentions of making 7 phannacology, at least the part that related to the 7 only ethical phannaceuticals. It's not what I was 8 products that we would be detailing the physician 8 asked to make. 9 about. 9 Q. And what are ethical pharmaceuticals? 10 A detail person's job is to sit down with the 10 A. Well, that's phannaceuticals that would require i 1 physician and say, We have this drug, and this is what i i a prescription. 12 it's used for, and would you need -- if you have any 12 Q. Okay. 13 patients that might have a need for this, we wish you'd 13 A. You know, they had some over-the-counter also. i 4 think about us when you write the prescription. 14 And a lot oftimes a drug, a phannaceutical, wil start 15 And some of the guys just -- or gals, because it 15 out as only under prescription, and after it's been on i 6 began to evolve about that time, they really never i 6 the market a while and particularly after the patent has 17 learned anything. They went out and partied the night i 7 run out, then they go to over-the-counter if it appears 18 before because we had these meetings in places like i 8 to be safe enough to use without that control. 19 Bourbon Street in New Orleans, and so they were so hung i 9 And so that's -- then these nutraceuticals came 20 over the next morning and too dumb to understand it in 20 along, and there they were using a lot of native things. 21 the first place or too lazy. vitamins, minerals, amino 21 They were using a lot of 22 Q. Right. 22 acids. 23 A. And so they really never learned it very good. 23 We were the first company to market free-fonn 24 Oh, well, here's the card, you know, the product 24 amino acids or combinations, coenzyme vitamins. We were 25 card (indicating). Oh, let's go play golf. And the 25 the first company to market coenzyme vitamins, very 20 (Pages 77 to 80) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Dews 2/11/2009 81 83 I popular in this field now. I coming in is going off on the sides and they can't use 2 And I can explain what a coenzyme vitamin is if 2 it, and you call them schizophrenic. It's not the only 3 you want to hear it. ..,) cause. It's one of the causes. 4 Q. Sure. Go ahead. 4 There is never, never one cause for any disease. 5 A. A coenzyme vitamin, that vitamin does not go 5 There are many. 6 into your body and do anything. And where I got onto 6 So using this, if you explain it that way, you 7 this, I was working with a group of psychiatrists from 7 explain it, and of course now pyridoxal-5-phosphate is 8 the American Psychiatric Association, and they noticed 8 one of the most popular nutraceuticals out there. 9 that when they gave megadoses of vitamin B6 that people 9 And I remember I said, Well, where was it 10 who were schizophrenic would get better, but then after 10 developed? It was developed by Merck, not in the i i a while it stopped working. 11 United States, in Danstadt, Germany. 12 And I said -- they said, Why? 12 Well, I knew their director of sales. I went in 13 You know, that's what i do. You go to a 13 early one day because ofthe time difference, picked up 14 pharmacologist for something like that. Jim, can you 14 the phone and called Darmstadt, and I called him and I 15 figure out what's going on here? 15 said, Do you have any pyridoxal-5-phosphate? 16 And so I looked into it. And I said, Doctor, 16 And of course he could speak English quite well, 17 I've done some research on this -- or Doctors -- and 17 and he said, Yeah, I think we have maybe a kilo. We got 18 what I found out is that vitamin B6 -- its chemical name 18 the patent back in the '50s and never came up with 19 is pyridoxine. I always like chemical names. It tells 19 anything from it and we just can't figure a use for it. 20 me what it is. Then I know what the structure is. 20 i said, Can I buy that kilo? 21 And i said that it's not used by the body in 21 Now, why? 22 that form. i said what you have to do, you have to 22 I said, Well, I've got a idea. 23 phosphorylate it. 23 He said, Okay, fine. 24 In other words, you link a molecule of 24 So I took that kilo and we made some tablets, 25 phosphorus to the vitamin and you turn it from a vitamin 25 put 50 milligrams. Well, the physicians wanted me to 82 84 1 into a coenzyme vitamin. It's another step. You've 1 use 250. i said, No, no, no, you don't need that much. 2 done something that their body hasn't done. 2 i could use less than 50 and it would work. Five-\u00ad 3 Well, does everybody need that? No. People 3 three our four would work of the right form, and tr 4 that can't metabolize it properly. 4 that just on your schizophrenic patients. That wasn't a 5 Well, why is that so? Well, ifl was trying to 5 double-blind study. 6 think of a simple way to explain it -- and that's one 6 And they tried it and it worked. They took them 7 thing I always tried to do when i was detailing 7 off of it; they went back. It would turn them on and 8 doctors, I would explain it so that anybody could 8 off like a faucet. Nothing but a vitamin. That's a 9 understand it. And the doctor would say, Well, you 9 miracle. 10 know, i knew the technical answer, but now i can 10 Is that a cure? We didn't claim it was. We 11 explain it to my patients. And i would kind of -\u00ad 11 know what they're using it for. But we don't think it's 12 fine. Whatever. 12 very smart to invest over a billon dollars in a new 13 But the point is this. Let's say that the 13 drug approvaL. 14 process of phosphorylizing that vitamin -- let's do an 14 Q. Well, in terms of your knowledge of putting 15 analogy. i love analogies. It's something that you can 15 together -- you know, extracting the chemicals out of 16 understand. And let's say that in the body that part 16 herbs, at what point in your career did you begin doing 17 that does that is like a funnel, so all of these 17 that kind of work? Was that always -\u00ad 18 vitamins and other minerals and other things go into the 18 A. Almost from the start. 19 funnel, and then it's metabolized into the coenzyme 19 Q. From the beginning. Okay. 20 form. After all, phosphorus is a mineral, B6 is a 20 A. And that's why they kept calling me, because i 21 vitamin, and they're linked together, and it comes out 2 I am creative. 22 the other end which is a very small opening, and then 22 Q. Okay. 23 your body can use it. 23 A. i like to say I'm just a dumb Texan. i don't 24 Now, in people that can't do it, their funnel is 24 know I can't do this, so i do it. 25 upside down, so all the vitamin B6 and phosphorus that's 25 MS.

QUALIFICATIONS As you wil see in my curriculum vitae, I am dually licensed in California as naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist. I graduated from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon in 1981 and have been licensed in both Oregon and California to practice naturopathic medicine. I graduated from Emperor's College of Oriental Medicine in 1986 and have been licensed in both California and ~ Oregon to practice acupuncture. I am a member of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians and the California Naturopathic Doctors Association and the California Society of Oriental Medicine and Acupuncture. I have practiced naturopathic medicine since 198 i , working with ditt, nutritional supplements, botanical medicine, and mind-body treatments. Since being licensed as an acupuncturist in California in 1986, I have integrated acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine into my work. My practice focuses on helping people identify the root causes of their condition, removing the obstacles to cure, and developing personalized natural treatment protocols to resolve symptoms and promote health. I evaluate patients through a variety of state-of-the-art laboratory tests and integrate nutritional medicine with herbal medicine and acupuncture. Since 2005, I have been on the faculty of San Francisco State University's \"Institute for Holistic Healing Studies\" within their Department of Health Education. Over the past 4 years, her popular classes include \"Naturopathic Medicine and Personal Wellness\", \"Nutrition and Herbal Medicine\" and \"The Holistic Health Speakers Series\". In 1998, I joined the board of directors of the California Naturopathic Doctors Association (CNDA). I took a brief sabbatical from my practice in May of 2000 to serve legislative campaign to as Executive Director of the CNDA and lead the successful 1 license NDs in California. Passage of the Naturopathic Doctors Practice Act resulted in the creation of the Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine within California's Department of Consumer Affairs. Licensure of NDs provides Californians legal access to the care of licensed naturopathic doctors. The established scope of practice in California allows licensed NDs to serve as primary health care providers who treat acute and chronic conditions, in a prevention-oriented approach to healthcare. For the last 22 years, I have witnessed the tremendous value that changes in lifestyle, diet and the correct use of the nutritional and herbal supplements can provide. During this time in practice I have had the opportunity to provide adjunctive care to patients undergoing conventional cancer treatment, utilzing a range of dietary supplements and botanical medicines that were compatible with their conventional regimen. The body has immense self-healing capacities, which when properly supported can respond and heal from even serious diseases. In my experience, people receiving chemotherapy and radiation fare better, in both the short and long term, when they concurrently use natural therapies and lifestyle to mitigate the side 'effects and support their overall health. An additional note: I have had the unusual experience of supporting my first husband, John LaMont, M.D., a family practitioner, through his death from non- Hodgkins lymphoma in 1992. John lived for 16 years with this cancer and as one of the first medical doctors interested in nutrition and natural therapies, he pursued virtually all known conventional and alternative treatment modalities. Together we explored a variety of nutritional interventions including the use of high dose intravenous vitamins, traditional Chinese medical options including acupuncture and variety of Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic medicine including working with Dr. Deepak Chopra in 1991, Dr. Stanislaus Burzynski's antineoplastic therapies and well as 4 rounds of conventional chemotherapy, radiation, monoclonal antibody therapies at Stanford and a bone marrow transplant. 2 Together, my education and these experiences give me a unique perspective as an expert witness in this case. II. SCOPE OF WORK I have been asked by the attorneys representing Daniel Chapter One to provide a opinions on the use of nutrtional supplements and botanical medicines in the prevention and treatment of ilness, including but not limited to cancer. In addition, I was asked to review the evidence that exists regarding the mechanisms of action of the major constituents of DCO's cited products and to provide an opinion of that evidence for: \u00b7 \"GDD\" \u00b7 \"7 Herb Compensation: Prior expert testimony: see prior disclosures. III. MA TERIALS CONSIDERED To form my opinion, I have conducted literature searches on PubMed, that includes over 18 milion citations from MEDLINE and other life science journals for biomedical articles back to 1948. PubMed includes links to full text articles and other related resources. I also utilized Google, and numerous websites including the website of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Dr. Duke's Ethnobotanical and Phytochemical Database and the database of the American Botanical CounciL. I have utilized several books, including Medicinal Plants of the World (Van Wyk and Wink). In addition, I have drawn from my experience as a practicing naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist who utilizes dietar supplements and botanical medicines in daily practice. I have also reviewed the information provided to me by Daniel Chapter One, including the Daniel Chapter One Product Labels, Literature provided by Daniel Chapter 3 One, and the Summary of Medical Evidence provided Daniel Chapter One, all of which I understand have been provided to the FfC by Daniel Chapter One and/or its counsel. iv. SUMMARY OF OPINIONS ON THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, advised his patients to \"Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.\" Traditional and indigenous cultures naturally understood the connection between plants as both their food and their medicine. Today, there is a growing body of scientific evidence to substantiate the fact that the natural compounds present in plants act in multiple ways to support our innate homeostatic mechanisms, improve physiological function and reduce the expression of disease. \"Epidemiological studies consistently indicate that consumption of fruits and vegetables lowers cancer risk in humans and suggest that certain dietary constituents may be effective in preventing (colon) cancer. Plant-derived phenolic compounds manifest many beneficial effects and can potentially inhibit several stages of carcinogenesis in vivo.\" Carcinogenesis 2000 May; 21(5): 921-7. Many population studies have demonstrated lower incidences of several chronic degenerative diseases in cultures that eat a plant- based diet compared to the Western diet. Campbell, TC, The China Study (Dallas, TX: Ben Bella Books 2005); Cordain, L., \"Origins an Evolution of the Western Diet: Health Implications for the 21't Century,\" American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 81, no.2 (2005): 341-54. Humans have co-evolved with plants and we survive and thrive today because our bodies utilize plants for sustenance. The macronutrents, micronutrients and phytonutrients in food and phytochemicals in plants are biologically active compounds that influence our metabolism. A wealth of information on potential treatments for cancer and other conditions dwells in the clinical knowledge of traditional and indigenous cultures and their Material Medica. Herbalists have long known that herbs are an extension of food and have used the plants of this earh as medicines. They have prepared teas and concentrated extracts to potentiate the therapeutic effects of these phytomedicines. More recently, ethnobotanists and pharmocognocists have worked to identify and catalogue these plants and their bioactive constituents. International researchers have begun the laborious process of isolating the biologically active 4 compounds and examining their mechanisms of action in order to determine their effect on various aspects of disease, especially carcinogenesis (i.e. the production of cancer or carcinoma). The biologically active compounds in plant medicines have been termed \"secondary metabolites\". Interestingly, the compounds produced by one species to protect them from their environment actually influence the metabolism of another species, and mimic the structure of our hormones, neurotransmitters and other aspects of our metabolism. These biologically active compounds have interacted with and shaped our physiological processes over milennia in a process termed \"evolutionary molecular modeling\". One of the advantages of using the phytonutrients present in food and the phytochemicals present in plants is that they exert their influences on multiple molecular targets. \"Secondary metabolites usually are multifunctional compounds because most of them carry more than one pharmacologically active chemical group. In addition, secondary metabolites usually occur in complex mixtures. In consequence, the extract of a medicinal plant affects more than one molecular target and it is likely that several targets are affected concomitantly when taking phytomedicines. In complex disorders, the application of such extracts increases the chances of \"hitting\" one or several relevant targets\". Van Wyk and Wink, Medicinal Plants of the World, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon 2003. In his recent book\" Anticancer -- AWay of Life\", oncologist David Servan- Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., who is himself a two-time cancer survivor, suggests we can approach cancer in this way: \"There are certain circumstances under which these savage bands are disrupted and lose their virulence: (I) when the immune system mobilizes against them, (2) when the body refuses to create the inflammation without which they can neither grow nor invade new territories, or (3) when blood vessels refuse to reproduce and provide the supplies the cells need to grow. These are the mechanisms that can be reinforced to prevent the disease from taking hold. Once a tumor is installed, none of these natural defenses can replace chemotherapy-or radiotherapy. But they can be exploited, accompanying conventional treatments, to fully mobilze the body's resistance to cancer\". Dr. Servan-Schreiber goes on to elucidate the growing body of evidence that a 5 diet rich in chemoprotective plants can assist us in multiple ways in our fight to prevent and support the treatment of cancer. (Servan-Schreiber, D., Anticancer-A Way of Life, Viking Penguin Press, New York, New York, 2008). Scientific research, a selection of which follows in this report, demonstrates that the phytonutrients and phytochemicals present in plants have the capability to act at the precise molecular targets that scientists are seeking to affect with the new generation of biological response modifiers: . Anti-angiogenic effect: green tea and ginseng Some examples of how plant phytochemicals act as \"biological response modifiers\" to affect our physiological process are detailed here in this report: . Watercress: rich in glucosino1ates that inhibits tumor growth, alters cell cycle regulation . Green tea (EGCG): signal transduction, inhibits COX2 and induces apoptosis, Knowledge of this kind of information should empower us to use these compounds as our food and as our medicine. The awareness of the powerful chemoprotective effects of plant foods and medicines should not influence patients with cancer and other serious diseases to abandon using the most effective methods that modern medicine has to offer. Furthermore, such knowledge does not diminish the need for further research but instead should hasten its pace. \"Phytomedicines often contain a mixture of substances that have additive or even synergistic effects, so that the health benefits are difficult to test or verify. Plant medicine 6 or phytochemicals may have subtle effects of several different biochemical pathways and receptors in the mind-body continuum that may all contribute directly and indirectly to restore equilibrium and balance. It is hard to dismiss medical claims of safety and efficacy when a plant medicine has been used in traditional cultures for centuries without evidence of serious side effects. Research results generated over the last few decades have given us a much better understanding of the scientific rationale behind many natural remedies.\" Van Wyk and Wink, Medicinal Plants of/he World, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon 2003. Without a doubt, research is urgently needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action of phytonutrients and phytochemica1s in the prevention and treatment of disease. The very complexity of these compounds presents immense challenges for research since they do not occur, nor do they act in isolation. One challenge with this approach is that it reduces the naturally occurring agent, which contains multiple compounds affecting multiple targets, to a single agent affecting a single target. While it is urgent that we understand the secondary metabolites and their actions, developing a new drug from that information is not the only worthwhile path. Adding to the challenge is the fact that research dollars are limited when natural agents can't be patented and their sale will never recover the cost of the research. As pharmaceutical scientific research works to identify new potential drugs from natural agents, it tends to diminish or dismiss the therapeutic value of the former. Traditional use evidence does not replace human clinical trials. There are real limits to our current understanding of plant-based medicines that rests mostly on cultured cell lines and animal models. But many would argue that it is not essential that we wait to recommend the use of the original plant compound until all the evidence has been collected. The current situation is that cancer patients in particular are denied the opportunity to utilize natural therapies in a clinical setting until they have failed In our rush to identify and utilize the most biologically active components of food and botanical medicines, we must respect the fact that for milennia mankind has used these foods and plants without evidence of serious harm. conventional therapies. 7 v. ANAYLSIS AND FINDINGS A. GDU The four main ingredients in GDU are reviewed in this document. 1) Bromelain 2) Turmeric 3) a group of plant-derived proteolytic enzymes isolated from the stem and core of the pineapple. It has been used in the Chinese Materia Medica, other Asian cultures and by Western herbalists for a wide range of applications including but not limited to traumatic injury and arhritis and cancer. Clinical Summary: Bromelain has many in vitro and in vivo studies and its properties include: I) the ability to interfere with growth of malignant cells; 2) inhibit platelet aggregation; 3) fibrinolytic activity; 4) anti-inflammatory 5) skin debridement properties. These biological functions of bromelain, a non-toxic compound, have therapeutic values in modulating a) tumor growth; b) blood coagulation; c) inflammatory changes; d) debridement of third degree burns; 3) enhancement of absorption of drugs.

CUff Ph arm Des. 2002; 8(19):1695-706 Clinical summary: A growing body of research suggests that curcumin has a potential for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Preclinical trials have shown that curcumin can both inhibit the formation of tumors in animal models and act on a variety of molecular targets involved in cancer development. In vitro studies have shown that curcumin induces apoptosis and some degree of selectivity of cancer cells. Clinical trials have revealed that curcumin is well tolerated and may produce antitumor effects in people with precancerous lesions or who are at high risk for developing cancer. This seems to indicate that curcumin is a pharmacologically safe agent that may be used in cancer chemoprevention and therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown, however, that curcumin may produce toxic and carcinogenic effects under certain circumstances and specific conditions and may alter the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Mol Nutr Food Res. 2008 Jun; 52 Suppll:Sl03.27 Human clinical trial: Oral curcumin is well tolerated and, despite its limited absorption, has biological activity in some patients with pancreatic cancer. Clin Can Res. 2008: 14(14): 4491-4499. Turmeric has demonstrated anticarcinogenic effect in cultured cell lines and animal models, at all phases of cancer growth including initiation, post-initiation, promotion, and progression, allowing it to be useful in secondary prevention. Cancer Research. 1999 Feb 1 (59): 597-601 11 The current science indicates multiple mechanisms of action to support the intake of such a level of turmeric along with other dietary sources of flavonoids (quercitin) as a reasonable suggestion for individuals who are fighting cancer. Biochemically active constituents and known mechanisms of action: To date, at least 94 biologically active compounds have been isolated from turmeric (Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database plant derived phenolic compound curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the most active constituent.

SCIENTIFIC NAME: T ANACETUM PARTHENIUM (COMPOSITAE) Feverfew, Bachelor's button, wild chamomile Historical use: Feverfew has been used for centuries as a febrifuge and for the treatment of migraines and arthritis. Other historical uses have been in the treatment of anemia, earache, dysmenorrheal, dyspepsia, trauma and intestinal parasites. More recently, it has been used in gardens to control noxious pests (its pyrethrin component is an effective insecticide and herbicide). Duke JA, Handbook of Medicinal Herbs. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1985 p.l 18 Clinical summary: Derivatives from the leaves of the plant have been used primarily to treat migraine headaches. Parthenolide extract has been shown to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. Another constituent of feverfew has antioxidant activities. A few in 14 vitro studies have shown that feverfew exhibits anticancer effects. See http://www .mskcc .org/mskcc/html/692 I 9 .cfm and below. Biochemically active constituents and known mechanisms of action: To date, 46 biologically active constituents have been isolated from Chrysanthemum parthenium. (Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases (accessed 1/09 but dated 1992. Since this time, the botanical name has evolved to be listed as Tanacetum parthenium). Parthenolide, a sesquiterpine lactone, has been isolated from the leaf of Tanacetum and has been the most studied constituent for its anti-inflammatory action. Additional constituents include Parthenolide has demonstrated effectiveness against cancer by inhibiting NF Kappa B activity: . Parthenolide has been used in conjunction with Su1indac, an NSAID, in the treatment of pancreatic cancers, demonstrating decreased NFkappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activities in cells treated with the combination compared with the single agents, demonstrating cooperative targeting of the NF-KB pathway. These data provide preclinical support for a combined chemotherapeutic approach with NF- KB inhibitors and NSAIDs for Mol Cancer 2005;4(4 ):587-594 \u00b7 Transcription factors such as NF-KB provide powerful targets for drugs to use in the treatment of cancer. In this report parthenolide (PT), a sesquiterpene lactone of herbal remedies such as feverfew (Tanacetum partheniuni) with NF-kB inhibitory activity, markedly increased the degree of human leukemia HL-60 cell differentiation when simultaneously combined with 5 nM ID:,25\u00ad dihydroxyvitamin Di (1,25-(OH)2D3). PT by itself did not induce HL-60 cell differentiation. In addition, These results indicate that PT strongly potentiates the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation into monocytes via the inhibition of NF-KB activity and provide evidence that inhibition of NF-KB activation can be a pre-requisite to the efficient entry of promyelocytic leukemia cells into a 15 differentiation pathway. British Journal of Pharmacology (2002) 135, 1235-1244 \u00b7 Parthenolide is a major sesquiterpene derived from feverfew (Tan acetum parthenium) with known anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, the anticancer potential of this compound was suggested. In this study, we determined the effect of lines: human lung parthenolide on proliferation of three human cancer cell carcinoma (A549), human medulloblastoma (TE671), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Parthenolide inhibited proliferation of all three types of cancer cells (A549, TE671, HT-29) and HUVEC with the following IC(50) values (in muM): 4.3,6.5, 7.0 and 2.8, respectively. Thus, the antiproliferative potential of parthenolide was confirmed. Pharmacol Rep. 2007 233-7 \u00b7 Parthenolide is an active sesquiterpene lactone present in a variety of medicinal herbs and is well known for its anti-inflammatory activity. The antimicrotubular and antipToliferative influence pac1itaxel activity.

The glycoside form is readily available in dietary plants such as onions, apple, buckwheat, red wine and teas. Quercetin has a number of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti\u00ad inflammatory, and anti-allergy. Quercetin is being used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, cancer prevention and treatment. http://www .mskcc .org/mskcc/html/69346 .cfm Biological activities and known mechanism of action: Quercetin is a flavonoid molecule ubiquitous in nature. A number of its actions make it a potential anti-cancer agent, including cell cycle regulation, interaction with type 11 estrogen binding sites, and tyrosine kinase inhibition. Quercetin appears to be associated with little toxicity when administered orally or intravenously. Much in vitro and some preliminary human data indicate quercitin inhibits tumor growth. Altern Med Rev. 2000 Jun; 5(3): 196-200 What follows is an overview of the research on quercetin and cancer from Alternative Medicine Review 2000 Jun; 5(3): 196-200: 17 . Quercetin was found to down regulate expression of mutant p53 protein to nearly lines. Lower concentrations gave less reduction. The inhibition of expression of p53 was found to arrest the cells in the G2\u00ad M phase of the cell cycle. undetectable levels in human breast cancer cell . Quercetin has been found to inhibit the expression of the p21-ras oncogene in cultured colon cancer cell lines. Mutations of ras proto-oncogenes are found in over 50% of colon cancers, as well as many other tumor types. . Radiotherapy: Quercetin showed a significant but mild enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of radiation on rat hepatoma cells when added to the medium. A human study showed topical and oral administration of quercetin to reduce skin damage during radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancers. . Chemotherapy: Quercetin has been shown to increase the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo in mice. An in vitro study using human ovarian and lines found that addition of quercetin to cisplatin caused a potentiation of the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin endometrial cancer cell . Quercetin has been shown in vitro to protect normal renal tubular cells from cisplatin toxicity. Adverse reactions: Human studies have not shown any adverse effects associated with oral administration of quercetin in a single dose of up to 4,000 mg (Eur J Clin Pharmacol 1975; 9:229-234) or after one month 1999; and Bromelain: May assist the absorption of Quercetin in the intestine.

The most for cancer is phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). Watercress may have exceptionally good anticarcinogenic potential as it combines a potent inhibitor of Phase 1 enzymes (PEITC) with at least three inducers of phase II enzymes (PEITC, 7-methylsulfinylheptyl ITC and 27 8-methylsulfinyloctyl ITC. These compounds act at three stages of carcinogenesis in that they: i. Inhibit carcinogen activation 2. Induce phase II enzymes and enhance excretion of the potential carcinogens and 3. Induce apoptosis via activation of protein kinase pathway. The putative anticarcinogenic activity of ITC is consistent with the results of epidemiological studies, which have suggested a reduction in cancer risk through the consumption of cruciferous vegetables.

WHEY PROTEIN Whey Protein: Whey is a co-product of cow's milk in the manufacture of cheese and in recent years has become a functional food. The two primary sources of protein in milk are the caseins and whey. After processing occurs, the caseins are the proteins responsible for making curds, while the whey remains in an aqueous environment. and minerals. Today whey is a popular dietary protein supplement purported to provide antimicrobial activity, immune modulation, improved muscle strength and body composition, and prevention of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Ali Med Rev. 2008 Dee; 4(13); 341-7 Whey Protein Constituents: Whey protein contains all the essential amino acids in higher concentrations than vegetable protein sources. They are efficiently absorbed and utilized relative to free amino acid solutions. Whey proteins have a high concentration of Branched chain amino acids (BCAA): isoleucine, leucine, valine, which are important factors in tissue growth and repair. Whey proteins are also rich in the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine, which enhance immune function through intracellular conversion to glutathione, one of the most impoitant the celL. Mechanisms of has potent antioxidant activity, likely by contributing cysteine-rich proteins that aid in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a potent 353-75 use whey protein as a source of cystein to increase levels. As a an endogenous antioxidant enzyme that converts lipid peroxides into less harmful hydroxy acids. In addition to the above mentioned properties, the alpha- lactalbumin component of whey chelates heavy metals and reduces oxidative stress because of its iron chelating properties.

J Nutr 1985;114:1403-8 Clinical indications: Whey's amino acid profile makes it useful for enhancing body composition, supporting protein synthesis and building lean body mass. For these reasons it has been used in patients with diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, to support pediatric bowel health, and to improve glutathione levels in individuals infected with HIV and in cancer. Alt Med Rev. 2008 Dec; 4(13); 341-7 Whey protein concentrates have been researched extensively with respect to cancer prevention and treatment, and glutathione stimulation is thought to be the primary immune-modulating mechanism.

The most biologically active are the as immunomodulating agent in treating immunodeficiency diseases and to alleviate the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, the anti-carcinogenic effects of Astragalus saponin extract were investigated in HT-29 human colon cancer cells and tumor xenograft. Our findings have shown that Astragalus saponins (AST): o inhibits cell proliferation through accumulation in S phase and G2/M arrest, with concomitant suppression of p21 expression and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. o promotes in through caspase 3' activation and po1y(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, which is indicated by DNA fragmentation and nuclear chromatin condensation. o demonstrates an anti-tumorigenic effects in vivo, of which the reduction of tumor volume as well as pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in HT\u00ad 29 nude mice xenograft are comparable with that produced by the conventional chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). / o reduced the side effects (body weight drop and mortality) associated with the drug combo 5-FU and oxaliplatin are not induced by AST. o These results indicate that AST could be an effective chemotherapeutic agent in colon cancer treatment, which might also be used as an adjuvant in combination with other orthodox chemotherapeutic drugs to reduce the side effects of the latter compounds: Carcinogenesis 2007 28(6):1347-1355; doi: 10.1 093/carcinfbgl238 \u00b7 A partially purified fraction (F3) with an estimated molecular weight of 20,000 to 25,000 derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus, was found to possess a potent immunorestorative activity in vitro. 32 These data indicate that F3 administration markedly enhances the rats' ability to reject the xenogeneic graft and therefore possesses a strong immune potentiating activity in vivo. These preclinical data also provide the rational basis for the use of extracts of Astragalus membranaceus in phase I clinical trials among patients suffering from iatrogenic or inherent immune deficiency states. J Clin Lab ImmunoL. 1988 Mar;25(3): 125-9. . Meta-analysis: Astragalus shown have immunologic benefits by stimulating macrophage and natural kiler cell activity and inhibiting T-helper cell type 2 cytokines. Many published studies have assessed the use of Astragalus and other Chinese herbal medicines in combination with chemotherapy. We sought to evaluate evidence from randomized trials that Astragalus-based Chinese herbal medicine combined with platinum-based chemotherapy (versus platinum-based chemotherapy alone) improves survival, increases tumor response, improves performance status, or reduces chemotherapy toxicity. Results: Of 1,305 potentially relevant publications, 34 randomized studies representing 2,815 patients met inclusion criteria. Twelve studies (n = 940 patients) reported reduced risk of death at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.87). Thirty studies (n = 2,472) reported improved tumor response data (RR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.46). In subgroup analyses, Jin Fu Kang in two studies (n = 221 patients) reduced risk of death at 24 months (RR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.68) and in three studies (n = 411) increased tumor response (RR = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.53). Ai Di injection (four studies; n = 257) stabilized or improved Karnofsky performance status (RR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.46). Conclusion: Astragalus-based Chinese herbal medicine may increase effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy when combined with chemotherapy. These results require confirmation with rigorously controlled trials.

Robert Langer, PhD at MIT followed with the observation that bovine carilage could inhibit neovascularization of solid tumors. Dr. John Prudden demonstrated that bovine cartilage could inhibit the in vitro growth of osteosarcoma and human myeloma cultured cells. Dr. Prudden developed Catrix, a bovine tracheal cartilage, and began treating end-stage cancer patients in 1972. This therapy exerted a major inhibitory effect on a variety of cancers but did not eliminate them completely. In 1983, Langer began work comparing shark cartilage to bovine carilage, reporting the same amount of shark carilage contained i 000 times the quantity of anti-angiogenic factor as did bovine carilage. Initial studies in mice by Wiliam Lane, PhD showed dramatic results of a decrease in tumor weight of 40% in the treated animals compared to a 2.5 fold increase in tumor weight of the untreated group. Dr. Lane outlined a case report of 8 humans in stage II and IV cancer utilizing 30 grams/day of shark cartilage taken as enemas, which produced very encouraging results. A human clinical trial of 29 patients suffering from stage IV and V cancers that had failed conventional therapies was begun. At the end of 16 weeks 38 of rectal enemas at a dose of one gram of powdered shark carilage per 2 pounds of body weight, some patients had marked reduction in tumor size and reduced vascularization of the tumor tissue and tissue adjacent to the tumor. Many patients reported a reduction in pain and an improved sense of well-being. Townsend Letter for Doctors: Review article Aug/Sept. 1994 In 1994, a Phase 2 human clinical controlled trial was sanctioned by the FDA and conducted by Dennis Miler, MD et al at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. The results of this 60 patient study concluded that under the specific conditions of this study, shark cartilage as a single agent was inactive in patients with advanced-stage cancer and had no salutary effect on the quality of life. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;ll?(l 1 ):3649-55. The challenge with this and other human clinical trials in cancer patients is that the only candidates for therapy are those who are end-stage and have failed conventional treatments. This obviously eliminates candidates who have a strong and functional immune system. In 2008, researchers isolated two partially purified anti-angiogenesis proteins from shark cartilage that were demonstrated to block microvessel sprouting in the collagen- embedded rat aortic ring assay in vitro and inhibition of capilary sprouting in the CAM assay in vivo. Bioscience Reports (2008) 28. (15-21) Cartilage in general, and shark cartilage in particular, have demonstrated inhibition of angiogenesis in cell cultures and animal studies. The shark cartilage that has been used in most studies was a highly purified protein derivative. The particularly high doses used, distinct fishy flavor and difficulty with routes of administration present unique challenges with this therapy in humans. 39 VI. SUMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Based on my expenence and expertse, as well as the reseach cited above,l hold the following opinions: A. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of GDU contan bromelain, a source of natual proteolytc enzymes from the pineapple, which helps digest unwanted proteins. GDU also contans tueric, feverfew and quercitin, which help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Next, it is reasonable to claim that these ingredients as a whole may be used as an adjunct to cancer therapy, and that the ingredients possess a wide range of actions as anti-inflammatory agents. B. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula fight tumor formation, and fight pathogenic bactena. C. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of BioMixx boost the immune system, build lean boy mass and support healing. It is also reasonable to claim that these ingredients assist the boy in fighting cancer, cachexia and in healing the destrctive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" D. There is a reasonable basis for the claims that pure skeleta tissue of sharks provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis - the formation of new bloo vessels. It is also reaonable to claim that angiogenesis has been demonstrted to inhibit tumor growth in some studies. Febru 4, 2009 ~~~ Nb)i 40 Exhibit 4 REPORT OF EXPERT WITNESS JAMES DUKE James A.

There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula \" . . ., fights tumor formation, and fights pathogenic bacteria.\" 2. There is a reasonable basis for the claims th\u00e1t the ingredients of GDU \"contains natual proteolytic enzymes (from pineapple source brome1ain) to help digest protein -\u00ad even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. This formula also helps to relieve pain and heal infammation. . GDU is also used for. . .and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. ODU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic activity. . .\" 3. There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of BioMixx \"boosts the immune system, ... to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" v. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS I base my conclusions, from my experience and knowledge, on three analytical points: First, herbal based and nutritional food information can be drawn from the Bible. Second, herbs, including those from the Bible provide help to the health of people that can be as good as or superior to help provided by pharmaceuticals. Third, significant science, as set out below, supports herbal use, and a system \u00ad which I call a third arm to a standard pharmaceutical study-could establish the value of herbs to the scientific gold standard urged by conventional science.. Without an approach like the third ar approach, it wil never be possible to find suffcient resources to run classical pharmaceutical studies on whole herbs, let alone to evaluate the hundreds of single chemical entities in each herb. 3 In the meantime the public should not be denied access to the information available that certain herbs have credible evidence that they contribute to healing, even for conditions such as cancer. In the absence ofresources for massive studies we have to rely on the less expensive science set out below. 1. The Science of Herbs: I begin with the third point first. Here are three ways I use to establish the efficacy of an herb: one is the Multiple Activities Menu's (MAM' s), the second is Indications Evaluations (IE's ), and the third is 60 abstracts in PubMed. I am only presenting ways one and two here. A. The MAM is a listing, recognized worldwide, which I have created and maintained for over 20 years on the United States Departent of Agriculture (USDA) website. Information is put into the website about the relationship between an herb and a thecondition.-in this case cancer. Then the information is drawn out for a review of curent scientific status of the herb in question. The following are Multiple Activities Menu's (MAM's) for 16 DCa herbs and their relation to cancer as recorded in the USDA website. . These can be done online at my USDA website. DANIEL CHATER ONE HERBS MAM's: Claw) for Cancer (79/31 =2.55) The number on the right hand side of the \"I\" is the number of cancer affecting aspects of the herb being evaluated. See Appendix II for detailed presentation of the MAM's for DCO herbs, such as the following one for Turmeric, presented as an example. (Tureric, one of the 16 DCO herbs, would certainly be in my meals were I subject to cancer, and I am genetically targeted for colon cancer. Tureric's curcumin is probably better than Celebrex, which like other synthetic COX-2-I's was once touted off-label for the prevention of colon cancer. There are 66 indications of Turmeric affecting cancer in this MA. Some are bolded. ) Curcuma longa (Turmeric) (One of the top 5 medicinal spices, with some anticancer activities, proven to my Evaluations (IE's) Summary: Review ofIndications of 16 DCO herb indications to pharaceuticalHerbs. (See Appendix II for comparson of indications) Actaea (Cimicifuga) racemosa (Black Cohosh). Widely respected for menopausal diffculties. * Allium sativum (Garlic): My most important herbal medicine, useful at preventing all the major kilers and sepses. Ananas comosus China as an anticancer immunomodulator. Camellia sinensis (Green Tea): Food faracy item promoted for many indications. *Curcuma longa (Turmeric): One ofthe top 5 medicinal spices, with some anticancer activities, proven to my satisfaction. Eleutherococcus senticosus (Eleuthero) Sold widely as an alternative to ginseng, adaptogenic tonic. Glycine max (Soybean): Studied by the late Judah Folkman and widely sold as a food farmacy item, in part for its mix of antiangiogenic isoflavones and quercetin. the *Nastuium offcinale (Watercress): Like most crucifers (members of Brassicaceae), this nutritious edible species is properly touted as a cancer preventive. Rheum palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb); Sold as laxative and in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Rumex acetosella (Sheep sorrel) Sold in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Smilax aristolochiifolia (Sarsaparila) Widely sold, e.g., for Lyme Disease; contains compounds which can be converted to hormones. Tanacetum parthenium (Feverfew) I think itsabout as good for migraine pharmaceutical sumatriptan. Ulmus rubra (Slippery Elm) Sold in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Uncaria tomentosa (Cat's Claw) Famed immunomodulator from Latin America; proofs possibly more promotional thanscIentific. 8 Half of the new pharmaceuticals wil be relabeled (with stronger warngs) or parially or completely recalled within a decade. Meanwhile, more expensive pharmaceuticals wil continue to cause many more deaths than are caused by the safe herbs we are led to believe are dangerous. They are not! Check the Bextra, Celebrex, and Vioxx, and, let me predict, soon-to-be-heard statin, stories (three close friends of mine, too old to be worried about cholesterol, have been hospitalized from statins) and head counts of iatrogenic fatalities. The Null Numbers: The total number of annual iatrogenic deaths in America is 783,936. (Null et al, 2003). , Remember, pharaceuticals have been with us less than 150 years. If our ancestors left Africa via the Holy Land 2000 years ago (for faith-based literalists), or maybe a milion years ago (for the less literal), then our genes, tracing back to our AfricanHoly Land ancestors, have had at least 10 times more temporal experience with Biblical herbs (e.g., cinnamon, coriander, garlic, grape, mint, milk thistle, myrrh, olive, onion, saffron, turmeric, and the like). Pharaceuticals and synthetic food additives are years of evolutionary experience with the thousands of phytochemica1s in these species. Our relatively new to our genes. Our bodies have had thousands, perhaps milions, of them. In many cases, by my educated guess, the body has evolved homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining homeostatic balances for these bodies may even require many of phytochemicals. Our bodies can sequester them from our dietary millieux if we need them, excreting them if we do not. We can prove this for simple elemental chemicals like selenium and zinc. I believe it is the case that homeostatic balancing activities exist for hundreds of many long-familar dietary components. We just, as Congress, signed an RDA for choline in the last decade. The farter we get from our Paleolithic diet, and 9 (more importantly) the more synthetic pharaceuticals and food additives we ingest, the more liable we are to suffer imbalances. It's not only food additives that hur us; it is the subtractives as welL. The subtractive phytochemicals are those important nutrients reduced or lost in food processing: \"Ofthe 12 micronutrients which were plentiful in the natural grain, including vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, folic acid, E and the minerals iron, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium, less than 30%, and in some cases less than 10%, have been retained in the wheat products we eat. (Levin, 1996)\" Restoring chemical balance may require getting back to basics, those primitive Paleolithic foods rich in phytonutrients. At the same time, we should reduce over- processed nutrent-poor junk foods, avoiding additives and even pharaceuticals where possible and plausible. I'm not saying there is no place for pharniaceuticals. But I wil say that in many cases there are balanced Biblical foods that are pharmacologically competitive with unbalancing pharmaceuticals, and these food famiaceuticals should be drgs of first resort, and the pharaceuticals last resort. you believe in me and my Biblical food farmaceutical shotgun more than you believe in your allopath and her/his expensive pharmaceutical silver bullets, there's a better chance that my natural approach wil help you. Believing is half the cure. Can you the And if believe in a company whose $2-bilion-a-year drug was shown in lAMA (Journal of American Medical Association) back in 2002 to be no better than placebo for major depression? Can you believe that now, three years later, that company stil has the premier lead-off ad page for the lAMA, touting the $2-bilion-a-year drug as so trsted, with Biblical walnut oil andso reliable, so effcacious? I suspect you'd be better off 10 Biblical saffron, nourishing AND medicating your body, attenuating the depression with few or no consequential side effects. If you count all the possible side effects reported in the fine print ofthat ad for the $2-billon-a-year pharmaceutical, there are more than a hundred. When that study was printed back in 2002 showing the pharaceutical no better than placebo, almost nobody heard that the drug failed too. The news was instead blaring out \"St. Johnswort no better than placebo.\" True, 81. Johnswort (SJW) fared no better than placebo in this clinical comparson ofSJW, Zoloft, and placebo. But that's the half the story that Joan Q. Public heard a thousand times, while maybe once or twice hearing that the pharmaceutical failed too. Do I think there is a pharmaceutical! PhDA/press conspiracy? I wil say that they are all singing the same song, and the song is wrong, and is hurting Americans. Their monotonous song drives American consumers from the safer food, herb and spice farmaceuticals to the more expensive, more dangerous synthetic pharmaceuticals. All this at the expense of our health and the health of our planet. Even our rivers and lakes, and consequently our water supply, are now cocktails of pharmaceutical residues. of 2. Some Biblical Herbs and Spices: Potential Alternatives to Pharaceuticals list (for more examples see Appendix IV) of long- known plants that by some definitions might be considered spices or culinary herbs.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS the DCO products in Reviewing the MAM's and the IE's for the constituents of the maner that I have reviewed thousands of uses for hundreds of herbs for several decades, it is clear that significant evidence in support of the following uses exists: There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula, \" . . ., fights tumor formation, and fights pathogenic bacteria.\" There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients ofGDU, \"contains natural proteolytic enzymes (from pineapple source bromelain) to help digest protein -\u00ad even that of unwanted tumors and cysts.

Q /)& Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1929, James A. \"Jim\" Duke is a Phi Beta Kappa PhD (botany, 1961) graduate of the University of North Carolina. Jim, following military service, undertook postdoctoral activities at Washington University and Missouri Botanical Garden in S1. Louis, Missouri. There he began studies of neotropical ethnobotany, his overriding interest to this day. From 1963 to 1965, Duke was ecologist with the USDA (Beltsville, Maryland), joining Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1965-71) for ecological and ethnobotanical studies in Panama and Colombia. During this formative period, Duke lived with various ethnic groups, closely observing their deep dependence on forest products. The first of some twenty books, his Isthmian Ethnobotanical Dictionary catalogs hundreds of Isthmian plants and their uses. Rejoining USDA in 1971, Duke had assignments relating to crop diversification, medicinal plants, and energy plant studies in developing countries. A popular lecturer on the subjects of ethnobotany, herbs, medicinal plants, and new crops and their ecology, he has taped dozens of TV and radio shows. The National Agriculture Library has a video history of Dr. Duke's career. Duke grows hundreds of interesting plants on his six-acre farmette (Green Farmacy Garden) with his wife and illustrator, Peggy. On Sept. 30, 1995, he retired after - 30 years with the USDA.Before retiring, Dr. Duke brought his renowned ethnobotanical and phytochemicial database online at USDA. It is now, in Duke's retirement, one of the most frequently consulted areas of the USDA website. Since retiring Dr. Duke has served for five years as Senior Science Adviser to Nature's Herbs. and with AIlHerb.Com Since 2001, he has been a distinguished herbal lecturer with the Tai Sophia Healing Institute, Laurel MD. USDA DATABASE http://ww.ars-qrin.qov/duke/; Pleiotropy Database Multiple Activities Menu Duke has already doubled the raw data content in the add-on module that he maintains for private licensure. The database is especially useful for determining biological activities and healing potentials of food ands herbs. There is a growing interest in his data from people in companies and organizations including: Proctor & Gamble Corporation, New Chapter, Herbal Science, GAIA Herbs, MD Anderson Cancer Institute and many others. Fluent in Spanish, Duke has studied and/or lectured widely, concentrating on tropical ecology, medical botany, and crop diversification. Widely travelled, Duke \"cut his tropical eye teeth\" in Panama where he was resident from 1966-68. While working on an encyclopedia of economic plants, he has collaborated with the National Cancer Institute on both their AIDS and cancer- screening programs and their Designer Food Program (to prevent cancer). His data bases on the ecology, nutritional content, folk medicinal uses and chemical constituents of economic plants are being widely utilized. Duke's major goal lately is to reverse the disdain for alternative medicines in the US, where, as in the Third World, a growing percentage of people can no longer afford nor trust pharmaceuticals. Duke has a contagious interest in natural foods and nutritional approaches to preventive medicine. Between 1990-1992, Duke was advising the Designer Food Program of the NIH, then under the aegis of Dr. Herb Pierson. Lately Duke has been very active in ecotourism in Latin America and is teaching such themes as renewable rainforest products in the rainforests of Amazonian Peru. He has become an expert in the field of non-timber forest products. In 2008, Duke has already led trips to the rain forests of Costa Rica and Peru, along with numerous honoraria speeches (see below). With an aggregate of more then a decade in Latin America, Duke has traversed parts of Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guadelupe, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. In Asia, he has had lengthy visits in China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and quick looks at Burma, Japan, Laos and Vietnam. In the Middle East, he has worked in Iran, Israel, Kuwait, and Syria, with quick looks at the Mediterranean countries of Egypt, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. His only tours in tropical Africa include Madagascar, Sao Tome, The Ivory Coast and Zambia. Recently he has been teaching field ethnobotany regularly in Amazonian Peru, Belize and Costa Rica (mostly in the winter) and in the Maine northwoods (in summer only). Duke belongs to the American Botanical Council (Trustee), American Herb Association (Life), American Society of Pharmacognosy, Association for Tropical Biology (Life), Council of Agricultural Science and Technology (Cornerstone Life Member), Herb Research Foundation (Advisor), International Association of Plant Taxonomists (Life), International Society for Tropical Root Crops (Life), International Weed Science Society (Life), Organization for Tropical Studies (Life), Oriental Healing Arts Society (Honorary), Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Smithsonian Institution (Collaborator), Society for Conservation Biology (Life), Society for Economic Botany (Life), Southern Appalachian Botanical Club (Life), and the Washington Academy of Sciences (Life ). Duke serves on the board of trustees of the American Botanical Council (ABC), and the advisory board of the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research ACEER, He also serves as an occasional advisor or consultant to Alternative Medicine Digest, American Health, the Center for Alternative Medicine in Women's Health (NY), Center for Mind-Body Medicine, Center for Plant Conservation, Herb Research Foundation, International Expeditions, Rodale Press, Prevention Magazine, Rosenthal Center for Alternative/Complementary Medicine, TRAMIL, and the World Health Organization (Traditional Medicine Program Routinely queried by editors and writers for several different popular and scientific health-oriented journals, and by producers of radio and television networks, both conservative and liberal, Duke recently has given accredited continuing education lectures on herbal medicine, pros and cons, to chiropractors, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physicians. Early on. He was part of the Scientific Advisory Team of Shaman Pharmaceuticals (San Francisco), Medical Advisory Board of Herbalife (Los Angeles), and serves as Medicinal Plant Adviser to Reader's Digest and Time-Life.

ZANG: 9 Q. Good morning, Dr. LaMont. JO My name again is Theodore Zang, and I'm an 11 attorney representing the Federal Trade Commission. 12 This is a deposition in the action of the 13 Federal Trade Commission versus Daniel Chapter One and 14 James Feijo, and the deposition is being taken now for 15 all purposes in this case. 16 A couple of procedural things before we go into J7 the substance of the deposition. J 8 I want the record to reflect that you are 19 represented today by counsel. Is that correct? 20 A. Yes. 21 MR. ZANG: And Jim, do you want to introduce 22 yourselves? 23 MR. J. TURNER: Yeah. 24 Jim Turner, Swankin & Turner, and 25 Christopher Turner from Swankin & Turner. 1 (Pages 1 to 4) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 2/17/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. LaMont, N.D. 5 1 Betsy Lehrfeld will be joining us in the 1 2 afternoon. 2 3 MR. ZANG: Okay. 3 4 And one of my colleagues may be coming in 4 5 shortly as well, David Dulabon. 5 6 THE WITNESS: Okay. 6 7 MR. ZANG: And also procedurally, Jim, can we 7 8 agree to the same procedural rules that we've been 8 9 following, which is that all objections except as to the 9 10 fonn of the question and as to the claim of privilege 10 11 are reserved? 1 1 12 MR. J. TURNER: Yes. 12 13 MR. ZANG: Okay. 13 14 BY MR. ZANG: 14 15 Q. Dr. LaMont, have you ever had your deposition 15 16 taken before? 16 17 A. No, J haven't. 17 18 Q. SO let me tell you a litte bit about the ground 18 19 rules. And I'm sure that Mr. Turner has said something 19 20 similar to you, but it's a very odd experience if you've 20 21 never had your deposition taken before. 21 22 So one thing I want to remind you of is that we 22 23 have a court reporter here, and she's taking down 23 24 everything that everybody says, and it's important to 24 25 articulate your answer rather than to shake your head as 25 6 1 you might otherwise do in conversation. i 2 A. Right. 2 3 you don't understand a question 3Q. Okay. And if 4 that I ask, please let me know, and I'll do my best to 4 5 state it again. 5 6 A. Okay. 6 7 7Q. If at any point you need to take a break, please 8 let me know, and we can stop and do that. 8 9 A. Okay. 9 10 Q. But one question which I need to ask is whether 10 11 you're taking any medication today which would prevent Ii 12 you from testifying truthfully and accurately. 12 13 A. No. 13 14 Q. And is there any other reason why you wouldn't 14 15 be able to testify truthfully and accurately? 15 16 A. No. 16 17 Q. Okay. If at any point you give an answer and 17 18 then you realize that you want to change that answer or 18 19 supplement it, please let me know because, again, the 19 20 important point is to have a full and accurate record -- 20 21 A. Right. 21 22 Q. -- so I'd like you to do that if that should 22 23 occur. 23 24 A. Okay. 24 25 Q. All right. Before we begin, do you have any 25 2 (Pages 5 to 8) 7 questions? A. I don't think so. Q. All right. Let's go ahead then. A. All right. Q. SO can you state your full name for the record, please. A. Sally Blake LaMont. Q. And can you also provide your business address, please. If it's the same as your home address, that's fine, too. A. Well, I have a practice, a part-time practice. Which would you prefer? Q. The practice address is fine. A. Okay. 131 Camino Alto, Suite F, in Mill Valley, you need that. MR. ZANG: And Mr. Turner, now that we're into the substance, could you please state what Dr. LaMont is being offered as an expert in. MR. J. TURNER: Yes. She's an expert in naturopathic medicine, herbal medicine, functional medicine, which would encompass California, 94941, if those, and acupuncture and in -- she is an -- we're offering her as an expert on nutritional supplements and botanical medicines in the prevention and treatment of illness and as an expert in reviewing the evidence that 8 supports the functional uses of the four products that are the challenged products. MR. ZANG: All right. BY MR. ZANG: Q. And Dr. LaMont, have you ever been a party to a lawsuit before? A. No. Q. Why don't you describe briefly your educational background, please. A. All right. I have an undergraduate degree in human biology with an emphasis in microbiology from Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas, where I grew up. And I then went on to the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon -- and that's a four-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school -- and took board exams for that. And I can define that later. And then I went through the Emperor's College of Traditional Oriental Medicine in Santa Monica, California, Los Angeles area, and earned my degree as an acupuncturist there and as a naturopathic doctor at the first school, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine. Q. And what I want to do now is briefly put on the For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 , Daniel Chapter One, et a!. LaMont, N.D. 2/1 7/2009 161 163 1 colon cancer or this will cure your lung cancer but I 2 rather that turmeric and bromelain and parthenolides and 2 3 chrysanthemum affect multiple aspects of carcinogenesis 3 4 and therefore are recommending that you use a food-based 4 5 dose of these compounds over time. 5 6 Q. Let me ask you this. 6 7 If on their radio show a caller called in and 7 8 said, I have colon cancer, what should I do, and they 8 9 said, Well, take one of our products, take this product, 9 10 would you have a problem with that approach? 10 I I A. Well, J don't know. 1 I 12 Q. For the first time in a while you're showing 12 13 some hesitancy. Explain your hesitancy. 13 14 A. J wouldn't want to have anybody say, Take this, 14 15 it's going to cure your colon cancer. 15 16 I didn't think that that's what these folks were 16 17 doing. I'm under the assumption that they're 17 18 recommending that these nutrients are going to support 18 19 their immune function and help to alter the progression 19 20 of cancer in its many forms. 20 21 The flip side of them not saying -- not 21 22 educating the public about the benefits of turmeric and 22 23 green tea and these different agents is that the public 23 24 goes unaware that there's anything else that they can do 24 25 to shore up their defenses when they're faced with 25 162 I cancer, and to me that's very -- that's problematic. I 2 It's part of the reason we're in this predicament 2 3 where -- 3 4 4Q. But there are good people like you around to do 5 that education, aren't there? 5 6 A. There are, but -- and there need to be a whole 6 7 lot more because the predominance at this point of the 7 8 conventional oncologists haven't got a clue that there 8 9 is a body of evidence that suggests that anything other 9 10 than pharmacological chemotherapy and radiation is 10 II effective in preventing or treating cancer. II 12 And it took Dr. Servan-Schreiber the diagnosis 12 13 of cancer twice to stop and really investigate that and 13 14 to determine, at the encouragement of his brother and 14 15 friends and publicists, that you've got to get this 15 16 information out. 16 17 So I think that there is real value to saying 17 18 use these products and others, that we understand some 18 19 mechanism of action whereby they could help to deter the 19 20 progression of cancer, not that that's going to cure 20 21 your cancer but that it may help you to survive the 21 22 process of being treated for it. 22 23 Q. And my line of questioning now is really just 23 24 going to isn't there a good way of educating the public 24 25 and a way that may not be so good or well-advised. 25 And to the extent that Daniel Chapter One is giving advice with respect to specifc cancers, isn't that one of the less well-advised ways to go about this process of education? A. Can you rephrase that, please. Q. Let me ask Josett to reread it, and then if you don't understand it, absolutely. A. Yeah. It's sometimes hard to track these long questions. Q. It's getting late. A. Yeah. (The record was read as follows:) \"QUESTION: And my line of questioning now is really just going to isn't there a good way of educating the public and a way that may not be so good or well-advised. \"And to the extent that Daniel Chapter One is giving advice with respect to specific cancers, isn't that one of the less well-advised ways to go about this process of education?\" MR. J. TURNER: Do you still want him to rephrase the question? THE WITNESS: Well, I'm just thinking about it. I'm trying to decide if -- if they are in fact giving specific advice regarding specific cancers. And I don't know that they are. i think i would have to see that in the context of their overall -- like i don't know an example that they're saying you have colon cancer, you should take ODU. I didn't -- I don't know that they're doing that. So i don't think I can answer that question without having the context that it would fit into, without fully understanding that context. BY MR. ZANG: they're approaching the topic in terms of disease and talking about cancer and what to take for cancer generally, are you comfortable with that approach? Q. If A. I'm \u00e8ertainly more comfortable with that than specifically relating that it -- this is going to cure your X cancer. That would fall into the that's-a-big-stretch category. The fact that these herbs, their formulas have a number of different constituents that we have established have known mechanisms of action where they can help to potentially prevent and stop the progression of cancer, I'm more comfortable with that. Q. But you're most comfortable with what, with the structure/function -\u00ad A. Yeah. 41 (Pages 161 to 164) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 164 2/17/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. LaMont, N.D. 165 167 I Q. -- approach? 1 2 A. I'm most comfortable with patients being 2 \" ,) educated, with -- not patients, the public, all of us. 3 4 Unfortnately, every time a study is done -- like you 4 5 never see any of these studies in the newspaper. And 5 6 whenever there's a study that's done even suggesting 6 7 that a supplement would be useful, immediately there's 7 8 another one that says that it isn't. 8 9 One that's bothering me right now is the one 9 10 that came out last week proposing that the 10 1 1 Women's Health Initiative study concluded that women 1 i 12 who take a multivitamin and mineral have no reduced -- 12 13 there's no reduction in the incidence of heart disease 13 14 or cancer. I don't buy that. 14 15 If you go back and look at the way that is done, 15 16 that was a questionnaire that those thousands of women 16 17 who participated checked did you take a multiple vitamin 17 18 and mineraL. We don't know whether they were taking-- 18 19 I don't want to name one, but let's just say a drugstore 19 20 variety low dose or whether it was one that actually had 20 21 a highly absorbable fonn at a potency that actually 21 22 might have been expected to promote health in a way that 22 23 another wouldn't. 23 24 I might have rambled there a bit, but it's a -- 24 25 Q. That's all right. 25 166 I One thing that sticks out in my memory is a 1 2 radio show transcript of the Feijos' radio show where 2 3 one of the Feijos referred to doctors or certain doctors 3 4 as Dr. Dumb-Dumb. I guess they were advocating use of 4 5 their own products and skepticism about some of the 5 6 doctors out there. 6 7 What do you think about that approach of 7 8 referring to some doctors as Dr. Dumb-Dumb? Do you 8 9 think that that's welI-advised? 9 10 A. DisrespectfuL. No. DisrespectfuL. 10 I 1 I mean, I may not agree with all doctors, but i 1 i 12 certainly respect their extensive training and the 12 13 paradigm that they're functioning in. 13 14 I actually have many close friends who are 14 i 5 medical doctors, was married to one, have -- am in a -- 15 16 function in a group of integrative doctors, hundreds if 16 17 not thousands of us who believe very much in the way i 17 18 have been speaking today, and I'm never inclined to 18 19 insult a doctor. 19 20 Q. IS there a danger if consumers don't continue 20 21 with traditional cancer therapy? 21 22 A. Yeah. 22 23 Q. Can you elaborate on what that is, what that 23 24 danger is? 24 25 A. WeIl, cancer is a very difficult process to 25 42 (Pages 165 to 168) stop once it's started, and depending on -- I think that they need to consult and become highly educated in -- whenever a person -- whenever a person is diagnosed with cancer, they need to make their life mission to understand everyhing that they can about their cancer, how it started, every factor that could have created it, caused it, tripped the trigger on carcinogenesis, and they need to thoroughly take responsibility for their health, seek multiple opinions. I personally wouldn't take the advice of any one doctor. I would talk to two or three. And I would do Internet searches and I would -- this is what I suggest my patients do. And I think that the more well-informed people are, the better choice that they can make about the direction that they want to go. Occasionally there will be a person who, for maybe religious purposes or they just live in a different mindset, that there is no way they're going to subject themselves to the traumas and poisoning effect of chemotherapy and radiation. And let's face it. It. . .is poisoning. I mean, these are cytotoxic agents and not in the sense of, you know, curcumin could kill a cancer cell, but these go in and kil all rapidly reproducing cells in the body. And you lose muscle mass and you lose multiple organ function, and it drives many people to the brink of death just from the therapy. And if they're lucky, they recuperate and can live with that five-year survival rate and be proclaimed a success. Lots don't. And I think -- what are we up to -\u00ad 65 percent now of people can live five years past their -- concluding their treatment. So there's a long ways to go there. Some people are just not going to succumb to that. But that's a choice they need to make. That's what I have to say about that. Q. All right. Let's continue on BioMixx. We've spoken about green tea. Let's go to the next-\u00ad A. And astragalus and Eleutherococcus -- did we talk about astragalus before? Q. I don't believe so. A. Well, that's a very famous Chinese herb that really needs to go on the record here for its long use in Chinese medicine. Astragalus is -- its common name is astragalus, too. Q. What page are you on? A. We're on page 31. In traditional Chinese medicine it's been known For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 168 , Daniel Chapter One, et 01. LaMont, N.D. 2/17/2009 209 211 I Do you see what I'm saying? 1 2 It's -- I used the evidence -- I used some of 2 3 this evidence back in the GDU report but actually 3 4 apparently did not pick up that parthenolide was a 4 5 constituent ofBioMixx, and I don't have it listed 5 6 here. I did astragalus, Camellia sinensis, green tea 6 7 and Eleutherococcus. I didn't include parthenolide 7 8 agam. 8 9 Q. And with due respect, wasn't that a significant 9 10 omission in your report? 10 11 A. It was. In retrospect it would have been good. 11 12 But you know, for the record I would like to suggest 12 13 that we excerpt the materials on pages -- bear with me. I3 14 (Pause in the proceedings.) 14 15 Actually it is in GDU -- pages 14 through 17 and 15 16 to add them to -- you know, consider that they could be 16 17 repeated and applied to BioMixx 17 18 Q. Well, I wil point out that the deadline for the 18 19 finalization of the report has passed, so you're welcome 19 20 to put that into the record, but whether or not it 20 21 actually can be considered part of the report is a 21 22 question for a later day. 22 23 A. Okay. 23 24 Q. Going back to the statement that BioMixx is 24 25 effective in the treatment of cancer, I want the record 25 210 I to be clear as to whether or not you believe that 1 2 BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer. 2 3 A. I've stated that there's a reasonable basis to 3 4 claim that the ingredients ofBioMixx boost the immune 4 5 system, build lean body mass, support healing and that 5 6 these ingredients may assist the body in fighting 6 7 cancer, cachexia, which is the wasting of cancer, and in 7 8 healing the destructive effects of radiation and 8 9 chemotherapy treatments. 9 10 Q. All right. And that's on page 40 of your 10 1 1 report; correct? 1 1 12 A. The conclusion page. Yes. 12 13 Q. But you did not write that BioMixx is effective 13 14 in the treatment of cancer; correct? 14 15 A. No. 15 16 Q. And that's not one of your conclusions? 16 17 A. I said it is a -- its ingredients assist the 17 18 body in fighting cancer. There's a fine line between 18 19 treating and fighting, as we've discussed throughout the 19 20 day. 20 21 Q. And so again, you're not concluding that 21 22 BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer; 22 23 correct? 23 24 A. Not independently, but as an adjunct I believe 24 25 that it is effective in, as I've stated, mitigating 25 some of the negative effects of chemotherapy and -\u00ad yes. Q. SO again, I'm just trying to get a clear record. A. Yeah. Q. And i understand it's your testimony that there's a fine line, but again, you're not concluding that BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer? A. In treating cancer, no. Q. Okay. And are you concluding that BioMixx heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy? A. No. I am saying that there's evidence to suggest that astragalus and Eleutherococcus may mitigate some of the effects of radiation and chemotherapy, but I'm not -- how did you put it? Heal? Q. Concluding that BioMixx heals the destructive effects? A. Heals, yeah. It may help to heal but not necessarily completely heals. MR. ZANG: Okay. All right.
