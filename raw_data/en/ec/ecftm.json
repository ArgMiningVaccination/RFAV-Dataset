Plus, did you know that vitamin C works best when paired with certain skincare ingredients? For example, Hyaluron has great [moisturising properties](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-hype-on-hyaluronic-acid-2020012318653) when used in skincare. With all its benefits, we can clearly see why this vitamin is highly regarded by many beauty enthusiasts. However, not all vitamin skincare are the same. Finding skincare products that are effective and contain a healthy concentration of vitamin C can often prove difficult. That's why leading skincare brand NIVEA has engaged with over 100 Malaysians to test the efficacy of its cold-extracted vitamin C.

This means if the colour stays dark or light brown, there is a high chance the vitamin C is not potent enough or it has been exposed to oxidation. Thus, the objective of this experiment is to observe the presence of active vitamin C and how it reacts to iodine. Let's take a look and see how some of these iodine experiments turned out: Pretty amazing, right? From the videos above, we can see that NIVEA Extra Bright C&HYA's cold-extracted vitamin C turns the iodine water clear almost immediately. The experiment shows that NIVEA Extra Bright C&HYA has a more potent content of vitamin C, and is packed with anti-oxidants. The secret lies in its formulation method, as NIVEA Extra Bright C&HYA uses cold-extraction technology that is able to extract vitamin C without heat, thus preserving all the good-for-your-skin, beneficial vitamins and nutrients while ensuring maximum skin efficacy. FYI, the iodine test is SIRIM certified, which further solidifies the efficacy of cold-extracted vitamin C compared to oxidised vitamin C. With this in mind, NIVEA has formulated their brand new cleanser with cold-extracted vitamin C and 3X Hyaluron, which detoxifies, brightens, and the skin.
