We centered this one around the skin friendly, detoxifying benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) and then added Eucalyptus and Sage essential oils to help you breathe easier and increase circulation. Research suggests that soaking in ACV may reduce the bacteria associated with body odor as well as Candida. The detox wouldn't be complete if you didn't leave the tub with a clean mood as well so we included bubbles and Bergamot to round out this amazing, cleansing soak. Handmade in Salt Lake City, Utah. Key Benefits: Detoxifier / De-stress / Skin Restoration / Respiration Ingredients: Sodium Chloride (Solar Great Salt Lake Salt), Sodium Citric Acid, High Oleic Safflower Oil, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (Coconut derived), Apple Cider Vinegar Powder, FD&C Colors, Bergamot Oil (Citrus Bergamia Fruit), Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Sage Oil (Salvia Officinalis).
