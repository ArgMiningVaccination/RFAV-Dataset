The vaccines can help prevent your child from spreading COVID-19 to others, which is particularly important for kids who interact with older relatives and other adults at risk for severe illness from COVID-19. They can also help keep your child from getting seriously ill if they do get COVID-19. Despite misinformation swirling on the internet, the COVID-19 vaccines have been used under the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, which includes studies in adolescents. These studies and the data collected on those who have already received the COVID-19 vaccine show there is no evidence that the vaccine poses any serious risk to young people. None of the vaccines being used in the U.S. contain a live virus, and therefore, they cannot infect anyone with COVID-19. As with vaccinated adults, vaccinated young adults and teenagers may experience mild, temporary side effects, but this is an indication of the immune response to the vaccination, not COVID-19. Unlike previous strains of the virus, the Delta variant is having a greater impact on infection rates and hospitalizations among children and younger people. A recent study showed that children and adults under age 50 were 2.5 times more likely to become infected with Delta compared to those older than 50 years. Our hospitals are caring for more children with COVID-19 now than at any other point in the pandemic. MIS in children is a serious, potentially deadly, condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. While the cause of MIS has not been fully confirmed, we know that many children with MIS had the virus that causes COVID-19 or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS is typically seen in school-aged children, but cases have been reported in young adults, which makes it important that all kids ages 5 and up get vaccinated. Children younger than 5 years are not yet eligible to get vaccinated. It's important that parents and other caregivers of those children get vaccinated to protect them from being exposed to or infected with COVID-19. Children ages 12 and up are eligible to receive a Pfizer booster.
