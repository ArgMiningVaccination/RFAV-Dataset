What are the benefits of Integrative Medicine? Integrative Medicine practitioners usually take a holistic/total person approach to their patients. They understand that overall health and well-being is a combination of multiple factors, including genetics, physiology, the environment, personal relationships, health beliefs, and the power of a positive medical interaction. In some situations, Integrative Medicine modalities may achieve similar results to conventional medicine with fewer side effects, and may create a greater sense of individual self-efficacy.
