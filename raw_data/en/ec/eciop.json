It's a fact that if we do not give our bodies regular physical activity throughout our lives, our bodies become very vulnerable to illness and disease. The Active Austin Guide is a component of the \"Walk Texas ACTIVE AUSTIN 10-Week Challenge.\", It is available in English and Spanish in all Austin Public Libraries. The \"Walk Texas ACTIVE AUSTIN 10-Week Challenge\" is a free program to help people find ways to include more \"movement\" or physical activity into their lives. The Active Austin Guide includes information on free or low cost resources in Austin and Travis County that promote physical activity or healthy nutrition. You will find lists of trails, parks, pools, nature preserves, and more. You will also find healthy nutrition programs and resources in this guide. There are programs in our community that teach people how to grow their own gardens, find farmers markets, and even offer cooking classes focused on traditional family meals with nutritious, fresh ingredients. Our daily choices regarding nutrition and physical activity are extremely powerful determinants of health. Physical activity done most days of the week has been proven to be so powerful that you can reduce your risks for or even prevent developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, obesity, and some cancers. The general guidelines are: 30 minutes or more a day for adults 60 minutes or more a day for children most days of the week \"30-minutes a day\" can be one 30-minute period of physical activity or broken down into two 15-minute or three10-minute periods in one day. The same thing goes for the \"60-minutes a day\" goal. It all adds up to make a difference in your health. We are all affected by chronic disease trends in our nation, state, county, and city. This is preventable disease and death. Prevention is so important. Walk Texas ACTIVE AUSTIN is a 10-week program designed to help you begin or maintain an active lifestyle. An active lifestyle includes walking, running, dancing, swimming, and any other mode of physical activity you enjoy doing.2For 10 weeks, all participants record their daily/weekly physical activity, which converts to points depending on number of minutes active and mode of activity (see \"Activity Chart\"). At the end of the program, medals are given based on total points (see \"Incentives for Participants of Walk Texas\"). Walk Texas ACTIVE AUSTIN is coordinated through the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department - Chronic Disease Prevention and Control Program. The program is free of charge for anyone living or working in the Austin/Travis County area. The idea is to connect people and build support for people to increase physical activity most days per week. You may participate as an individual or group member (any age or stage of life) or as group leader (age 18 years and older). Each participant must register to take the 10-Week Challenge. Complete a registration form and release of liability and return forms to your group leader, or the Walk Texas ACTIVE AUSTIN Coordinator (see title page). Each team member tracks their own daily physical activity. Every week, team members report their progress to their group leader. The Walk Texas ACTIVE AUSTIN 10-Week Challenge is offered four times a year, beginning in January - March, April - June, July - September, and October - December. A brief orientation is offered prior to each new Challenge, to train new group leaders and/or new participants. The location of the orientation changes, contingent upon community sites willing to host the meeting (such as libraries, churches, work sites, etc.). Group LEADERS: start by recruiting team members to participate in teams of 5 to 10 people. An adult from your team agrees to be the Group Leader and attends the orientation training. All groups have autonomy to name their group, and decide where, when, and what they do to become more active as a team. Team members can also include physical activity they do on their own or with activity-buddies.

You want those closest to you to know your goal to become more active, and that they can do it too. You can also put flyers (provided upon request) around the neighborhoods where your team will meet. Talk to people and invite them to join you. Talk to neighborhood associations, churches, and groups that meet in your area to recruit team members. Have each team member complete a Registration Form and Release of Liability Form (provided). Every week, team members will report their progress to you. Your task as Group Leader is to keep track of their weekly progress and help them stay motivated. Meeting Time/Day: Your group can schedule a meeting time and date when ever is most convenient for your team. We recommend you meet as a group at least once a week at the same time, day and location. If you need help finding a location, we can help you decide on a safe place for your team to meet. If your team can not meet together every week, plan two trips in the beginning of your 10-Week Challenge to give your members the opportunity to find one to two buddies within your group to exercise with at a time convenient for them. Your planned trips could be to go on guided tours of local nature preserves, or try a new sport or activity together as a team, like tennis, basketball, or swimming. Motivating Team Members: Believe it or not, just checking in with team members once a week to get their weekly point totals is a huge motivator. Another source of motivation is keeping a journal or log of daily activities. Team camaraderie and the buddy-system increase commitment. Think of playful ways to challenge each other, whether it's a hula-hoop contest, jump-roping, or weekly badge of honor for most enthusiastic or motivated members. Keep track of Team Members' Success: You can track of your team members' weekly success using a wall chart (we provide) or any way you wish. Some Group Leaders use spreadsheets or data bases. The choice is up to you. At the end of your Challenge, have each team member complete an Award Form and Evaluation Form (provided). Be sure to submit all Award forms at the end of your 10-Week Challenge so we can provide you with medals. Reward Team Members: Praise and kind words of encouragement really do go a long way. You can reward members throughout the challenge just by acknowledging their efforts and progress. Ask your team to come up with ideas for how they would like to celebrate the end of their 10-Week Challenge. At the end of the challenge, celebrate your success together!5Physical Activity Benefits The benefits of regular physical activity are limitless!

Choose an activity that you enjoy or want to learn. If you enjoy the activity, it serves more than one purpose: stress reduction, joy, healthy physical body. 2. Find a place to exercise. At home - jump rope, exercise DVD's, on-line work-outs, ... In your neighborhood - walk, jog, run, bike, swim, garden, ... At local fitness centers - exercise classes, exercise instruction, socialization, and support At the mall - most malls open early for mall-walking 3. Use proper equipment. Proper equipment will help reduce risks of injury. Wear some form of ID. Wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows freedom of movement. Dress for the weather. Cold weather: dress in layers. Wear reflective bands if outside when dawn/dusk. If shoes are old and worn, invest in a new pair. Check with a local sporting goods store or sport shoe store for the shoes that are right for you and the activity(s) you choose. It is not necessary to buy the most expensive shoes or the newest exercise outfit, unless that will motivate you! 4. Always exercise at your pace. Use the \"talk test\" for aerobic activities. A good rule of thumb is - if you can talk, but not sing, you're exercising at a good pace. Strolling is good for the soul, but won't increase your fitness level. Keep your goals in mind. 5. Include a warm-up, a cool-down, and stretching with your activity. Start activity slowly and increase intensity gradually. Also, remember to cool-down when you're done. Walk around for a few minutes to allow heart rate to return to normal resting rate. Stretching is important for proper function of the joints. Stretch after exercise. See \"Stretching Basics\" on next page for more information.126. Drink plenty of water. When you exercise, your body temperature increases because heat is a by-product of work. Your body loses heat through the evaporation of sweat off the skin. If you don't get enough water, you can easily become dehydrated and risk heat exhaustion, cramps, or heat stroke. General rule of thumb: Number of ounces of water to consume per day [more if outdoors or exercising] = current body weight in pounds divided by 2. Ex. 100 pound person should consume 50 ounces or more of water per day. 7. Develop a support group. Encourage others to join you. Attend an exercise class. Work with a local clinic to promote a new walking group, and lead the walks on same day, time, and place every week. Socializing during exercise is a great way to develop friendships, it helps motivate you, and provides opportunity for receiving some positive feedback on your progress. 8. Have FUN! STRETCHING BASICS If you have any back, neck, bone or joint problems, please consult with your physician before beginning a stretch routine. When a muscle is stretched, it al - lows fuller range of motion at the joint, and helps to prevent or treat injuries. Use slow, static (no bounce) stretches and work within your limits, or stretch to the point where you feel mild tension. If you feel pain, ease up a little so you don't pull a muscle. It is best to stretch after your muscles are warmed up, or after your work - out. Breathe! Don't hold your breath while stretching. Try to hold your stretch 8 seconds, and slowly over time work up to 30 seconds per stretch. Stretch the muscles that are used for the physical activity of your choice. For example, for walking, make sure to stretch your calves and quadraceps after your walk. A few stretching tips: 1. Calves: Lean against a wall or chair, facing the wall, with right leg bent and left leg straight behind you. Left foot: toes and heal should be in a line point - ing straight to wall. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in lower left leg (calf muscles), and hold for 8 - 30 seconds. Switch legs. Repeat. Stretch each side one or two more times. 2. Quadraceps: For balance, use a chair or wall to lean on with left hand. Right hand reaches behind to grab right foot. Make sure right knee is close to left leg, 13pointing down to ground. Tilt pelvis forward until you feel the stretch in front of leg (quadraceps). If you don't feel a stretch, tilt hips forward. Hold 8 - 30 seconds. Switch sides. Repeat. Stretch each side one or two more times. 3. Lower Back: Sit on the floor with feet straight out at sides. Bend right leg so that right foot is near groin. Slowly bend forward from hip toward left foot until you feel mild tension. Keep back straight. Hold for 8-30 seconds. Don't forget to breathe. Switch sides. Repeat on each side one or two more times. 4. Arms - triceps: Raise right arm directly up, then let right hand fall behind head while right elbow is pointing up to the ceiling. Take left hand to right elbow and gently push arm down until you feel a stretch in the back side of upper arm (tri - ceps). Hold for 8-30 seconds. Switch sides. Repeat. Stretch each side one or two more times. 5. Neck: Keeping shoulders down, and arms hanging loose at sides, let right ear fall toward right shoulder until you feel a stretch on left side of neck. Hold about 10 seconds. Bring head back to center. Repeat on left side. Stretch each side one or two more times. Do not do head rolls. Target Heart Rate Target heart rate (THR) is a range of heart rate (beats per minute) used to determine how hard you are exercising. It's a good way to pace yourself and monitor your progress in physical activity. To use this method effectively, you will measure your pulse periodically during exercise and strive to stay within 50 to 75 percent of maximum heart rate. Target Heart Rate Formula: Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is computed mathematically by subtracting your age from 220: 220 - AGE = MHR Then, to find your range, multiply MHR by 60% to 85%, for lower and higher range: MHR X 0.6 = Lower range (LR) MHR X 0.85 = Higher range (HR) Divide both the lower and higher ranges by 6 to determine how many heart beats per 10 seconds for your range. Take your radial (wrist) or carotid (neck) pulse for 10 seconds during and after workout to assess your exercise intensity. Rate of perceived exertion is a scale of 1 to 10 to tell you how hard you feel you are working. On the scale, 1 is equal to \"couch-potato\" mode, 4 is equal to work - ing somewhat hard, 7 is equal to working very hard, and 10 is too much. The scale is easy to use and is highly related to heart rate. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how do you feel right now?14 How Hard Should I Work Out (Intensity)? When you are first beginning a new activity, strive for the lower range of your THR for the first few weeks. Gradually build up to your higher target heart rate over time. After 6 months, you can increase your intensity up to as much as 85% of your THR comfortably. Because everyone is different, you may be exercising at a hard rate and your heart rate doesn't show it. Or you may feel as if you are hardly moving and your heart rate may be very high. Your heart rate will fluctuate depending on: how much sleep you have had how much water you have had to drink how much stress you are having when you last ate and heredity. Note: A few high blood pressure medications lower the maximum heart rate and thus the target heart zone rate. If you're taking such medicine, call your physician to find out if you need to use a lower target heart rate when you exercise.15WARNING SIGNS Heart Attack Warning Signs Some heart attacks are sudden and intense. Yet most heart attacks start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort. The people affected aren't always sure what's wrong and may wait too long before getting help. Here are signs that can mean a heart attack is happening: Chest discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain. Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach. Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort. Other signs may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or light- headedness. As with men, women's most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. But women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particularly shortness of breath, nausea/ vomiting, and back or jaw pain. Even if you're not sure it's a heart attack, have it checked out (tell a doctor about your symptoms). Minutes matter! Fast action can save lives \u2014 maybe your own. Don't wait more than five minutes to call 9-1-1.

TALK (Is their speech slurred of face droopy?) REACH (Is one side weak or numb?) SEE (Is their vision all or partly lost?) FEEL (Is there headache severe?) For more information: 1-888-4STROKE or www.giveme5forstroke.org Source: The Stroke Collaborative: American Academy of Neurology, American College of Emergency Physicians, & The American Heart Association.16 Hypoglycemia = low blood sugar. This may happen to a person who has diabetes. Common symptoms may include: Nervousness, shaky feeling Cold sweats Faintness, feeling dizzy Sudden blurred vision Feel extremely hungry Sudden change in mood, very irritable or incoherent Headache Pounding heart beat If the person is conscious, have them sit or lie down. Give the person sugar in the form of fruit juice, soft drink, candy. Do not allow the person to continue to exercise. If the person loses consciousness, have someone else call EMS (911). Make sure the person is breathing and has a pulse. Do not try to give the person sugar if they are unconscious! If they vomit, turn them on their side. If you are trained in CPR and the person has no pulse or breathing, proceed with CPR. PREVENT Heat Illnesses: Heat cramps - painful muscle cramps in the arms or legs from overexertion in the heat. Have the individual drink water or commercial sport drinks and stop activity. Try massage of the cramped muscles. If cramps do not stop, take the person to the hospital. Heat exHaustion - extreme weakness, profuse sweating, clammy skin, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Blood pressure may drop and the person may faint. Heat exhaustion occurs following intense exercise in a hot, humid environment. Have the person stop all activity and rest in a cool place. Replace fluids with water or a commercial sport drink. Call EMS (911). Heat stroke - the most severe form of heat illness. Heat exhaustion can move to heat stroke if the individual does not replace fluids and rest. Heat stroke symptoms include NO sweating, high body temperature (106 degrees or higher) and lack of consciousness or extreme confusion. Call EMS (911) immediately and get this person to the hospital! Sponge the skin with cool water until help arrives.17 APD on Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail. - Photo by Sabrina McCartyPERSONAL SAFETY - MAKING THE RIGHT RESPONSE By Officer Scott Stephens, Senior Police Officer (retired), Crime Prevention Specialist - Austin Police Department Walking is one of the best activities to maintain good health and a good out look on life. There are many places in Austin where being outdoors is safe and occasionally there are places that are not safe. To maintain your margin of safety you must reduce the opportunity for you to be selected as a target of crime. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings! Walk with confidence and look at people approaching you. This look need only be long enough to see what the person looks like. Many people are selected as targets of criminals because they are sure that the person has not seen them and cannot pick them out of a police line up. When the risk is small the opportunity exists. Avoid wearing expensive jewelry while walking. This could make you a target for thieves. Crime Triangle There are three elements that must be present for a crime to occur: desire of a criminal to commit a crime; the ability to commit the crime; and the opportunity for the crime to be committed. We can only control one of the elements - deny the opportunity for the crime to occur. Do not leave targets for thieves visible inside your car. These targets consist of mail, radar detectors, clothing, and music accessories. If your address is visible on mail left in your car, a thief will know where you live and that you aren't home (= opportunity). Also remember to place valuables inside your trunk before you arrive in the parking lot. It is easy for experienced thieves to get into the trunk of vehicles. Don't advertise what's in your trunk. Trust Your Instincts If you think something is wrong - it probably is. Consider your instinct for trouble as your guardian angel and don't ignore it. React before it's too late. Don't let anyone violate your personal space without a reaction from you. Never allow your self to be abducted to another place. A robbery or physical assault can occur on first contact; something worse can occur if you go Desire Ability Opportunity18anywhere else with them. Break and run away, leaving your valuables behind - your life is more important. Thanks to our intuition we know when we are in danger, even though we don't know why. Extra Tips Consider carrying a throw down money clip with a small amount of cash. Contact police for suspicious persons-this could prevent an attack for you or a friend. If any group of people makes you feel uneasy or they are not using the property as intended, contact the police CALL 9-1-1 - for your safety and the walking area safety. Walking Routes It is not recommended to walk after dark. If your walk is expected to extend past sunset, choose a path that is well lit. Don't walk on unfamiliar trails alone. If walking after dark, walk with a friend. If walking alone, vary the times and routes that you walk. Crime Prevention Tips for any Situation: Four Basic Rules 1. React Immediately -Your best chance to escape violence is in the first seconds. 2. Resist -Immediate, Direct, Explosive. 3. Don't go to crime scene #2 -Always more isolated and always worse for you 4. Never, Never, Never give up! -Your attitude can help keep you alive Have A Plan We can deny the opportunity: If an item to steal is not easily accessible or the chances of the crime being witnessed are good, then the likelihood of the criminal risking getting caught or not getting anything of value is too great. Remember: \"You have the responsibility for yourself, to yourself, for your own safety.\" Habits you Can Live with! STAY AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS Walk with confidence and look at people approaching you. Have keys readied to enter your vehicle/office/home door. Don't carry too many items. DEVELOP YOUR REACTION PLAN 19There should be at least two parts to your plan: 1. Have something to say -Look squarely at someone you are concerned about and be firm in your response. NO! Get away from me! Don't I know your mother? Be Creative! 2. Have something to do -Scream while fleeing - this draws attention to the incident. Use a personal alarm\u00a9 or self defense spray. Fake a seizure, vomit, pee in your pants, pick your nose, talk to yourself. Be prepared to use defensive tactics. throw your car keys away from you to deny the attacker/abductor of taking you hostage in your car and leaving no evidence of your danger. Most importantly, you must do what ever it takes to survive a hostile encounter. The correct response to each encounter will never by the same so you must be open to other options. PREDATORS: Look for someone vulnerable to control Watch you like an animal. Follow you, waiting for the opportunity. May engage in conversation to test you. Will lie to you (its natural for them) Want to Control you! The first contact between the predator and the prey is the time when the prey has the most control. Deny control from the first contact. HOW DOES A STRANGER GET CONTROL? FORCED TEAMING - \"WE\" DISCOUNTING \" NO\"! TYPECASTING - You're Too Snobbish to Talk to Me. CHARM - Is there a motive for this? UNSOLICITED PROMISE - \"I promise I'll get out of the car if you just....\" Too MANY DETAILS - to distract you from person sneaking up on you? LOANSHARKING- \"you do this for me, I'll do that for you\" \"MIND SET\" AGAINST VIOLENCE Visualize yourself in a crime scene. Visualize your actions toward escape. -(Be as explosive as you have ever been) Visualize being injured and winning. 20Safety Tips for Motorists & Parents By Doug Ballew, Public Health Educator, Austin/Travis County Health & Human Services Department Motorists : Watch for Children! * By virtue of their weight and speed, motor vehicles are dangerous to children on foot and on bicycle. It is difficult for pedestrians in general, and child pedestrians in particular, to judge the distance and arrival time of a motor vehicle. The faster the vehicle's speed, the harder it is to judge its arrival time. * Watch for kids especially during times when they may be on their way to and from school (6 to 9am and 2 to 5pm) -- not just in school zones, but on all routes near schools. Children may be more likely to be injured on their way to and from schools outside of school zones than in school zones where crossing guards and flashing speed zone lights often provide them with the greatest protection. * Be observant of where school buses stop in your neighborhood, and watch for the greatest amount of child pedestrian activity there. Never attempt to pass a stopped school bus from either direction while its red lights are flashing. * Children are most likely to be injured in the afternoon when they are most active and rambunctious and when traffic is the most intense. Be especially attentive near schools and in residential areas in the afternoon. * Watch for children near parks, swimming pools, convenience stores and other likely neighborhood kids' destinations. Children are also sometimes injured near schools on weekends, holidays or on school days when they return to play on school grounds after crossing guards have gone and school zone lights are no longer flashing. * Reduce speed and proceed with extra caution if you see or hear an ice cream vendor's truck. Children are likely to be nearby. * Drive slowly on all residential streets and be aware that children may dart into the street with little warning. * Give children on bicycles a wide berth and drive slowly when you pass them. * Watch for children riding out from driveways on bicycles. * When turning, watch for child bicyclists riding across the street from sidewalks in pedestrian crosswalks.21Parents : Not long ago, children routinely moved around their neighborhoods by foot or by bicycle, and that was often how they traveled to and from school. Today, the decline in the number of children who walk or bike to school is apparent. At the same time, childhood obesity and physical inactivity have increased dramatically. Our project aims to make bicycling and walking to school a safer and more appealing transportation choice thus encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle from an early age. We are... A project of the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department Funded by the Texas Department of Transportation What we do? We work with schools, community partners, parents and volunteers to: Educate children, parents, and neighbors on walking, biking, and driving safely in and around schools. Enforce safe driving, pedestrian and cycling behaviors through a partnership between law enforcement and community members. Encourage walking and biking to school through community events. Evaluate activities and initiatives to ensure a quality program is being delivered. What can you do? There are several ways that you can contribute to the health and safety of your child's life: Determine the safest route to your child's school with the fewest streets to cross and utilize cross walks and crossing guards while avoiding busy or high-speed streets. Coordinate with other parents in the neighborhood to take turns leading walking school busses or bike trains (walking or biking with groups of children) to school. Practice safe walking and bicycling with your child. Be sure your child wears a properly fitted bike helmet every time they ride. Follow correct drop-off and pick-up rules if driving to the school is necessary. Most of all.... enjoy spending time walking and biking with your child.

Americans spend over $33 billion a year on weight loss programs, books, diets, and products, yet the trends are increasing in obesity and overweight, especially in children. Some think the Food Guide Pyramid is to blame, yet most Americans don't even follow the guidelines given in this model. January 12, 2005 , the 6th Edition of the National Guidelines for All Americans was released. It is updated every 5 years. \"My Pyramid,\" formerly known as the \"Food Guide Pyramid,\" was released in April 2005, as seen in model below. Please go to web site: http://www.mypyramid.gov to learn more about eating healthy. Key recommendations from the new Dietary Guidelines follow, reprinted from web site: http://www.healthierus.gov/dietary guidelines/ 2005 DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS Key Recommendations for the General Population The following information can be found at: http://www.mypyramid.gov WEIGHT MANAGEMENT To maintain body weight in a healthy range, balance calories from foods and beverages with calories expended. To prevent gradual weight gain over time, make small decreases in food and beverage calories and increase physical activity. [If you are trying to lose weight, or have a chronic disease such as diabetes, please make an appointment to meet with a registered dietitian. They can help you set reasonable goals to make changes in nutrition habits to improve your health.] PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Engage in regular physical activity and reduce sedentary activities to promote health, psychological well-being, and a healthy body weight. To reduce the risk of chronic disease in adulthood: Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate- intensity physical activity, above usual activity, at work or home on 23 most days of the week. For most people, greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in physical activity of more vigorous intensity or longer duration. To help manage body weight and prevent gradual, unhealthy body weight gain in adulthood: Engage in approximately 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous- intensity activity on most days of the week while not exceeding caloric intake requirements. To sustain weight loss in adulthood: Participate in at least 60 to 90 minutes of daily moderate-intensity physical activity while not exceeding caloric intake requirements. Some people may need to consult with a health care provider before participating in this level of activity. Achieve physical fitness by including cardiovascular conditioning, stretching exercises for flexibility, and resistance exercises or calisthenics for muscle strength and endurance. ADEQUATE NUTRIENTS WITHIN CALORIE NEEDS Consume a variety of nutrient-dense foods and beverages within and among the basic food groups while choosing foods that limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, salt, and alcohol. Meet recommended intakes within energy needs by adopting a balanced eating pattern, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Guide or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan. FOOD SAFETY To avoid microbial food borne illness: Clean hands, food contact surfaces, and fruits and vegetables. Meat and poultry should not be washed or rinsed to avoid spreading bacteria to other foods. Separate raw, cooked, and ready-to-eat foods while shopping, preparing, or storing foods. Cook foods to a safe temperature to kill microorganisms. Chill (refrigerate) perishable food promptly and defrost foods properly. Keep cold foods cold: * 400 F or below. Do not eat food left out of refrigeration more than 4 hours. Remember \" food temperature danger zone:\" bacteria thrive at 400 F to 1400 F. Bacteria still grow outside this range, but more slowly at freezing temperatures . * Source: http://culinaryarts. about.com/od/safetysanitation/a/bacteria_2.htm Avoid raw (unpasteurized) milk or any products made from unpasteurized 24milk, raw or partially cooked eggs or foods containing raw eggs, or raw or under cooked meat and poultry, unpasteurized juices, and raw sprouts. Also see: Food Safety at http://www.foodsafety.gov/ - Gateway to government food safety information. The Top 4 Cool Rules The Chill Factor\u2014Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared foods, and leftovers within 2 hours of purchase or preparation, or within 1 hour if the temperature is above 90 \u00b0F. Marinate foods in the refrigerator. The Thaw Law\u2014Never defrost food at room temperature. Thaw food in the refrigerator. For quick thawing, submerge food in cold water in airtight packaging, or thaw food in the microwave if you'll be cooking it immediately. Divide and Conquer\u2014Separate large amounts of leftovers into small, shallow containers for quicker cooling in the refrigerator. Avoid the Pack Attack\u2014Don't over-stuff the refrigerator. Cold air must circulate to keep food safe. FATS Consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fatty acids and less than 300 mg/day of cholesterol, and keep trans fatty acid consumption as low as possible. When selecting and preparing meat, poultry, dry beans, and milk or milk products, make choices that are lean, low-fat, or fat-free. CARBOHYDRATES Choose fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains often. Choose and prepare foods and beverages with little added sugars or caloric sweeteners. Reduce the incidence of dental caries by practicing good oral hygiene and consuming sugar- and starch-containing foods and beverages less frequently. SODIUM AND POTASSIUM Consume less than 2,300 mg (approximately 1 teaspoon of salt) of sodium per day. Choose and prepare foods with little salt. Rinse canned vegetables. At the same time, consume potassium-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. 25ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES Those who choose to drink alcoholic beverages should do so sensibly and in moderation -- defined as the consumption of up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed by some individuals, including those who cannot restrict their alcohol intake, women of childbearing age who may become pregnant, pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents, individuals taking medications that can interact with alcohol, and those with specific medical conditions. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided by individuals engaging in activities that require attention, skill, or coordination, such as driving or operating machinery. tHe following information includes guidelines and various reputable web sites to find out more about the food guide pyramid (see link above), eating fruits and vegetables, healthy recipes, nutrition research and healthy eating habits for health.

Fruits and vegetables can be great sources of the following important nutrients. Calcium: Calcium is essential for healthy bones and teeth. It is also needed for normal functioning of muscles, nerves and some glands. Fiber: Diets rich in dietary fiber have been shown to have a number of beneficial effects, including decreased risk of coronary heart disease. Folate: Healthful diets with adequate folate may reduce a woman's risk of having a child with a brain or spinal cord defect. Iron: Needed for healthy blood and normal functioning of all cells. Magnesium: Magnesium is necessary for healthy bones and is involved with more than 300 enzymes in your body! Inadequate levels may result in muscle cramps and high blood pressure. Potassium: Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain a healthy blood pressure. Sodium: Needed for normal cell function throughout the body. Most diets contain too much sodium which is associated with high blood pressure. Vitamin A: Keeps eyes and skin healthy and helps protect against infections. Vitamin C: Helps heal cuts and wounds and keeps teeth and gums healthy.

Check out the beautiful web site: http://www. ci.austin.tx.us/preserves/ Or e-mail your questions and comments to: Louis Rene' Barrera at: rene.barrera@ci.austin.tx.us Definition of a Nature Preserve City nature preserves are sanctuaries for native plants, animals, and their habitats, and for unique natural features. Your city preserves are managed primarily for the protection of these species and features. They also provide educational, scientific, and aesthetic benefits for the people of Austin. Description of Program The Austin Parks Department's Nature Preserves Program manages many sites representing Austin's diverse natural resources. These special parks help increase the public's knowledge and appreciation of Austin's natural heritage. They are for nature-related activities only, such as nature walks, bird watching, and nature photography. Staff and volunteers cooperate in site protection, habitat restoration, research, educational activities, rare plant rescues, trail building, and outings. Rules All life is protected here. No picking the flowers, fruits, or nuts, or digging up the plants. No harassing or injuring any animal species - even if you don't like the species. Leave the bones, fossils, and minerals too. It is hard to do, but do it anyway. Stay on the marked people-paths. These are routed around erodible areas, wildlife homes, and other sensitive features. For example, don't climb or let your children climb on cliff faces or steep slopes. This destroys the cliff plants. To provide a tranquil atmosphere and to protect the preserve species and habitats, travel by foot only. Nature Preserves do not have jogging trails or picnic areas. Please pack out what you pack in. No large groups unless authorized. Quiet please. No radios or cassettes or shouting. The following information is reprinted with permission from the Austin Parks and Recreation Nature Preserves guide. 34 35Blunn Creek Nature Preserve Blunn Creek Preserve is 40 acres of stream side and upland woods and meadows between St. Edward's Drive and Oltorf Street, west of Travis High School. The trail head is at St. Edward's Drive, just east of Eastside Drive. The spring-fed creek and the hack berry/elm woods support resident wildlife and offer refuge, rest and food for migratory species. The woodlands are in transition ecologically, and may ultimately become oak/elm/hack berry woodland. Older remnants of the Preserve feature mature oaks and old native Texas persimmon trees. Here are special geological features. One of two lookout areas is composed of compacted volcanic ash, deposited in the late Cretaceous Age - 100 million years ago. Visitors can see the cone of the old volcanic eruption beneath the Main Building of St. Edward's University. The Preserve was purchased with General Revenue Bonds in 1982 for $1.8 million. St. Edward's at Sundown Photo by Rene Barrera36Mayfield Park and Preserve Mayfield Park and Preserve is located next to Laguna Gloria on West 35th Street. The 22-acre park and preserve is located directly on Barrow Brook Cove of Lake Austin. Donated in 1971 by Mrs. Mary Mayfield Gutsch, the grounds include the preserve woods, a series of five lily ponds, and a home, which is representative of turn of the century suburban lake cottage retreats. Numerous peafowl can be seen roaming free. The Mayfield Park and Preserve is mature oak and juniper woodland, with an understory of mountain laurels, elbow bush, silktassel, and turk's cap. In the past, the land was used as cow pasture. Today the native habitat is invaded by Chinese Ligustrum, which competes with the native understory plants like Silktassel for needed light and water. Trails meander through the woods and cross the creeks with bridges and footstones. There is a duck blind located along the lake trail. One may enjoy the lake view and wildlife without disturbing the wood ducks and other aquatic birds that make this preserve their home.37 \"Keep Austin Wild\" Red Shouldered Hawk with Chick ~ Image by John Ingram38 Zilker Nature Preserve & Metropolitan Park The west end of Zilker Park has the 60-acre Zilker Nature Preserve, with walking trails and the Austin Nature Center. Zilker Nature Preserve was designated as a Preserve in 1935. The Zilker Preserve features an ephemeral creek edged with meadow, stream side habitats and a high cliff with shallow caves. A rock-walled ramada overlooks the Preserve and downtown Austin. The habitat directly above the cliff is endemic to the drier portions of the Edward's Plateau. Wooley croton bush and myrtle croton, as well as mountain laurel are in abundance. Town Lake is nearby. Foot trails start at Barton Springs Drive under the Loop One Bridge, and also at the Nature Center. The Austin nature Center is located at the west end of Zilker Park, off Stratford Drive, west of Loop One. The Nature Center complex has exhibits and programs describing Austin's past and present native habitats and wildlife. Plan to walk some of the extensive nature trails! There are interpretive signs placed along the way to educate and inform. Parents can share the information tidbits with their children.39Goat Cave Karst Nature Preserve The Karst Preserve is located in southwest Austin off Brodie Lane south of William Cannon trail. Karst Preserve is 8 acres of trails featuring sinkholes, caves, and the honey-comb limestone of the Edward's Aquifer Recharge Zone. \"Karst\" is a limestone plateau in Eastern Europe much studied by geologists. The word is used today to mean any area of limestone where erosion has produced deep fractures, sinkholes, underground streams and caverns. The Edward's Aquifer Recharge Zone is home to hundreds of caves and sinkholes and fractures. A pleasantly shaded, short trail winds past caves, sinkholes and honeycomb rocks. The first sinkhole/cave is Wade Sink. You may explore it if you like. The second cave we ask you to leave alone as a resting place for wildlife by a temporary metal gate. Arrange for family or group tours of the third cave through the Austin Nature Center at 512/327-8181. From William Cannon go south on Brodie Lane, turn right onto Deer Lane. Pull over to the right near our sign where the road widens just before Coastal Drive. Stillhouse Hollow Nature Preserve (Formerly called Spicewood Springs Preserve) Within these 19.8 acres of shin oak and ashe juniper woodland are Karst sink holes and Cotterell Cave. Secluded deep within the huge canyon are several verdant yet vulnerable springs that sustain resident wildlife. Designated as Endangered species habitat limits all human activity to the main trail. Remember that signs are in place warning of $ 500.00 fines for leaving the main trail. To get to Spicewood Springs Nature Preserve, take MOPAC north to Spicewood Springs; go west (left) on Spicewood Springs Road to Mesa 40Drive - take a left; go to Burney - take a right; go to Sterling drive - take a right. Preserve will be on your left. Park on Burney if gate is closed. A beautiful 0.31 mile paved trail winds through Preserve to a wooden deck. Please park on Burney Street if gate is closed. For handicap access contact 327-7723. Stephenson Nature Preserve and Outdoor Education Center is one of Austin's best kept secrets. With over one hundred and forty-seven acres this southwesterly located natural area has expansive wildflower meadows and dense woodlands. Once part of a thousand acre ranch this preserve still shows remnant signs of it's past. Evidence of previous hog pens and corrals exist. Several old live stock ponds remain and one will be restored to benefit wildlife and migratory birds. A historic stone wall meanders along the western boundary of the preserve and traces the hillside with grander. Wildlife that frequents the preserve vary from gray fox, white tailed deer, and wild turkey.

Pass on left. Use verbal warning when passing or when situation warrants. Yield to the lesser power (cyclists to joggers, joggers to walkers, etc.) Run or walk no more than two abreast. Ride in single file. Speed is the major cause of accidents on the trail. Slow down in crowded situations or on turns or hills. Fast cyclists use the road. Give the trail all the respect you would normally give a narrow, curving, congested roadway - because that's what it is. Please note Nature Preserves do not permit dogs or bikes.

TRAIL Easy BeginnerInter- mediate Advanced Barton Creek Greenbelt x x x x Walnut Creek Park x x x City Park (Emma Long) x x x x McKinney Falls/Onion Creek x x x St. Ed's Park x x x Mule Shoe LCRA Park x x x Bluff Creek Ranch Warda x x x Pedernales Fall State Park x x x Rocky Hill Ranch Smithville x x x 71Rating System, defined: Easy Trail Short distances and smooth surfaces. Suitable for novice riders including kids. Kind of like a sidewalk, but made out of dirt... Beginner Level Still pretty smooth and easy, but the trail may have a few rocks, some tight and twisty sections and maybe some steep ups and downs. Nothing too hairy, though... Intermediate Level Tougher than Beginner. These are 'real' mountain bike trails. The trail will have a combination of one or more of the following: rocks, tight, twisty stuff, steep ups and downs, drops/ledges and hard climbs... Advanced Level Tough trail for more experienced riders. Expect lots of rocks and drops, the possibility of extended climbing, fast down hills and plenty of opportunities to inflict bodily and bike damage... THE BARTON CREEK GREENBELT Directions/Access points: Zilker Trail Head - West of the shallow end of Barton Springs Pool in Zilker Park. Spyglass - Take Barton Skyway east from MOPAC until it dead-ends. 360 - On the north side of 360 between MOPAC and Lamar, use the dirt parking lot at the bottom of the Toy's R Us hill. Gaines - MOPAC frontage road south of 360. Hill of Life - Take Scottish Woods road west (south) on 360 to Camp Craft rd. Turn right on Camp Craft Rd. and trail head is up the street approx 100 ft. (Parking available on east (north) side of 360 at school.) Trail Description: The +/- 8-mile (one-way) \"greenbelt\", as it is affectionately known, has it's share of rocky, technical , gnarly challenges for even the most advanced riders. It's definitely not the place to try to hammer, not just because it's technical, but because many hikers use the trail 72and because WE ARE ALL VERY POLITE OFF-ROAD CYCLISTS WHO ALWAYS GLADLY SHARE THE TRAIL and RESPECT OTHER TRAILS USERS (RIGHT? RIGHT!). There are numerous blind curves where a hiker, or another biker, could be coming around and a head-on (or even a glancing blow) will do little to advance your mountain biking career. After rainy spells the creek retains a good bit of water, making for some wet and wild creek crossings. Of course, there's rarely water in the creek during the summer when we need it the most. From the trailhead at Zilker to the trail at the dam past the Hill of Life, there are no less than 7 creek crossings to splash through. What's the Hill of Life, you ask? The Hill climbs about 150 feet in a 1/4 mile and it's about as close to real \"mountain\" biking as you're going to get in Austin. At the top of the hill it pops you out onto Camp Craft Road & Scottish Woods Drive, which shortly connects you to Loop 360 at Westlake High Drive. Then you can road it back to Zilker from there and still get home in time for dinner. There are pretty good information signs posted at the Zilker Park, Loop 360 and Hill of Life/ Scottish Woods entrances to the Greenbelt. The Barton Creek Greenbelt is an incredible natural resource, please respect it... and have fun! Contact Information: After a heavy rain the Parks Dept. closes the trail until it dries up some, so it's a good idea to call beforehand if it has rained in the last few days. To get current trail conditions and closure information, call the hot line anytime at 472-1267. Fee: No Fee for this public access trail. WALNUT CREEK TRAIL Directions: Located in North Austin, just off IH-35, the trails at Walnut Creek Park are easily accessible from all parts of the city. To get there, go north on either IH-35 or Mopac Expressway and exit onto Parmer Lane. Take Parmer east from Mopac, or west from the Interstate to N. Lamar Blvd. Go south on Lamar for about a half-mile, looking for the park sign on your right. Trail Description: The main trailhead is near the first parking area on the left, near the swimming pool. This 12+ mile network of trails is over 90% twisty 73singletrack, with a few jumps, down hills, and creek crossings thrown in. This is a work-in-progress with many new sections added. If you ride here check out anything that looks new, because it's all pretty sweet, thanks largely to the efforts of one guy, Mark Henneke, who has single-handedly built and cleaned up a lot of these trails. At first the trails seem like a maze with no flow, but after riding them a couple of times you find the loops and it's possible to do about 12 miles of continuous trail. Be careful until you learn the trails, as there are 2 or 3 places where unrideable dips can sneak up on you. To learn the trail, come out to one of the regularly occurring ARR rides at the park. Fee: No Fee for this public access trail. CITY PARK (a.k.a. \"Emma Long\"), Austin TX . Directions: Take 2222 exit from MOPAC or 360, head west to City Park Road. Turn left and go 3.8 miles to Oak Shore, turn left and go 0.9 miles until you see the motocross sign on the left, and you're there. Trail Description: Difficult. Six mile loop with technical rocky ledgy drops and climbs mixed with a bit of fast twisty hard pack. It's challenging - probably one of the most technical trails in Texas - but it's also a ton of fun. Important Stuff: This is an endangered species habitat so BE NICE! Stay on the trails. As you might have gathered, there might be motorcycles there. Listen and get out of the way if you hear one - you'll know about them before they know about you. And be friendly to the motorcycle riders - they built this trail and maintained it for years before mountain bikes ever came around. They were nice enough to let us ride their trail - so be nice back to them. Contact Information: 512-837-4500 Austin Parks & Recreation Department. Fee: No fee for this public access trail McKINNEY FALLS STATE PARK / ONION CREEK Directions: 183 South towards Lockhart. 'Bout 1.5 miles past Hwy 71 turn right on McKinney Falls Parkway. Park entrance is about 3 miles on the right. Trail Description: Easy / Intermediate. The McKinney Falls Homestead trail 74is an easy three mile loop across the creek from the parking area. Most of the trail twists and turns through the woods and then climbs up the hill to the back side of the park. There is a fun little whoop-de-do and a quick downhill run back to the creek. Most people ride counter-clockwise starting at the homestead, but this trail is NOT one way. This is a good trail for kids and beginner riders but has enough twists and dips to still be fun for the quicker intermediate riders. This is the trail ARR uses for the Kid Trips program and there are always hikers in the park so yield the trail to slower users. Upstream from the Upper Falls take a right turn off the paved path onto the singletrack that runs along Onion Creek. This trail follows the creek to a lava flow. Cross William Cannon on the Longhorn Pipeline easement, cross the creek for five more miles of trail in Onion Creek District Park and Greenbelt. Contact Information: 512-243-1643. Fees: Kids 12 and under are free. All others $2.00 per day. For Camping Reservations at all state parks call 512-389-8900 (M-F 9a-6p) SAINT EDWARD'S PARK Directions: Take Spicewood west from 360. Look for a parking lot on the left after bridge #5. Yes, they are numbered. There is room for one or two cars near the sign, the parking area is around the curve from the sign. Trail Description: There are two main parts to this trail - the singletrack near the creek and road side, and the 'climb' and singletrack trails on the hill. The roadside/creekside stuff is pretty flat and simple - nothing technical or hard. The 'climb' is an excellent challenge - a rocky, 8% average elevation gain over ~ 7/10ths of a mile. Once at the top, you can take the singletrack down and enjoy crossing the gully and the view from the ridge. Repeat that loop a few times each week, and you'll be a climbing fool before you know it. Fee: No fee for this public access trail MULESHOE BEND Directions: Take Highway 71 west past the Pedernales River. Approximately 2 miles past the Pedernales River turn right on Paleface Ranch Road. Continue on Paleface Ranch Rd. (go straight at the 3-way stop) until you get to Co. Rd. 75414; this road tees into the road you're on from the right and there are several fine landmarks to help find it, including a sign on the left for the Exxon/Kountry Kitchen, Windemere, and the George Jones Donkey Farm (no kidding). Turn right on Co. Rd. 414 and this road will end at Muleshoe, about 2.8 miles later. The road really curves a lot, but just stay on it and you'll get there. Trail Description: The Muleshoe trail is a perfect complement to the trails we already enjoy in the Austin area. It is a 7.5-mile loop trail with 95% wooded singletrack with some moderate climbs and descents, a few drop-offs, lots of twists and turns, and a couple of small creek crossings.... oh, yeah and a nice big lake to cool off in after the ride. The fact that it makes a big loop with jeep roads intersecting at 5 points along the trail makes it nice for beginners and families who might not want to complete an entire loop and provides good access to the trailhead/parking area. And for the intermediate/advanced riders, its a trail you can go fast on and have a lot of fun. (Watch out for feral hogs\u2014 they're out there!) This trail is a wonderful example of what can happen when mountain bikers work in partnership with land agencies combined with persistence, organization, and of course, a lot of hard work. As usual, a relatively small group of dedicated volunteers have made this trail a reality. Fee: $5 entry fee per vehicle.
