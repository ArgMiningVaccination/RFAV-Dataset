The shelves were bare. Books on Chinese traditional medicine, never numerous, were out of print. It was the moment, one would have said, for an enterprising publisher to put together a quickie. What Herder & Herder have given us instead is work contracted for in the pre PingPong era, carefully researched and written by someone with all the time in the world: a Buddhist monk. Stephan Palos, a Sinologist and former physiotherapist living in a Tibetan exile monastery in Switzerland, became acquainted with acupuncture in his native Hungary. He addresses his book, \"The Chinese Art of Healing,\" to intelligent medical and lay readers who want more than a popularization such as \"Acupuncture and You,\" by Louis Moss (London, 1964), and need less than the magistral text, \"Pathogenie et Pathologie Energetiques en Medecine Chinoise,\" by Nguyen Van Nghi (Marseilles, 1971). In his opening chapters, the author leads us through a bewildering mass of historical documents. (Some 4,250 are available to medical scholars.) They begin with the encyclopedic and muchquoted \"Yellow Emperor's Clas sic of Internal Medicine,\" collected at about the time of Christ; wind up through the productive period of the Sung Dynasty; quickly past the stagnant Manchu era, to the Nanking Government's attempts to eradicate traditional practices in favor of Western scientific medicine; and, finally, come to the rehabilitation and reappraisal of acupuncture under Mao Tsetung. Traditional medicine is holistic. The mindbody dichotomy that permeated so much of preFreudian medical thinking in Europe\u2014and is still clung to by doctors more comfortable with the palpable soma than the spooky psyche\u2014is alien to the Chinese. (A willing suspension of disbelief is required, however, of readers schooled in Western philosophy and trained in the scientific method, if they are to understand a treatment whose philosophical underpinnings are a mixture of Taoism and Buddhism, and whose claim to validity is based almost solely on the empirical evidence of the cures.) Health is thought to be governed by a flow of T'chi (vital energy), composed of Yang and Yin forces, along welldefined routes called meridians. To keep a healthy body in good tone, or treat a sick one, preciselylocated points along the meridians are needled. As an aid to visualizing the T'chi system, Palos has provided anatomical drawings. Unlike the medieval, dashingly theatrical figures wearing colorful turbans and loin cloths used in older books, these drawings are modern; and unlike the neuter charts recently brought out of China, they are explicitly masculine. (The monastery influence?) The heart meridian, we notice in a moment of recognition in otherwise foreign territory, traces the path described by the pain in angina pectoris\u2014across the chest, down the left arm and into the little finger. Acupuncture massage, the external treatment of the points by carefully circumscribed hand movements in place of the needles; moxibustion, the lighting of cones of artemisia vulgaris (wormwood) to prepare the area about to be punctured (and described by James Reston in his autobiographical fragment, \"Now, About My Operation in Peking\"); pharmacological treatment with herbal medicines, of particular interest to those disenchanted with synthetic drugs, are all described in some detail. Since traditional medicine is preventive medicine (in the good old days of Li Chukuo, ghostwriter to the legendary Yellow Emperor, people paid the doctor only if he kept them well), respiration and exercise are not left to chance. T'aiChi Chuan, a series of disciplined shadowboxing movements, requiring so little vigorous effort they can be performed with safety by the aged and ill, have recently\u2014like so much chinoiserie\u2014come into vogue in exercise classes in New York. Perhaps the most interesting chapters are devoted to presentday practices. Through the cooperation of the Chinese Medical Society in Peking during the years when Westerners had little contact with Red China, Palos was able to follow the rapid evolution of an ancient therapy in a Marxist society. Not surprisingly, Taoist terminology is fading fast. There is less and less talk of Yang and Yin these days. On the other hand, \"secret\" formulae, previously handed down by word of mouth from one practitioner to another like family recipes, are being recorded and tested. For the first time careful records are being kept. A nationwide survey of results achieved through treatment with acupuncture was conducted between 1951 and 1954. Out of a total of 8,063 patients treated, 2,816 were judged \"cured,\" 4,604 \"markedly improved\" and \"improved.\" Of major significance is Chi Lien's invention of electroacupuncture: it is her work that led to the use of electricallyvibrated needles to induce drugless anesthesia for major surgery. The revolution in Chinese traditional medicine, set in motion by Mao's directive that all doctors must study acupuncture, was accelerated during the Cultural Revolution\u2014when those who had resisted the order were rusticated to the provinces and told that they must not only learn needletherapy but also that, having learned it, they must treat patients previously rejected by \"bourgeois medicine\" as hopeless. Experimenting on themselves, these men found that by inserting the needle an unheard of one inch and a half into the \"silent point\" (the back of the head) they were able to cure certain kinds of deafness. Later, their technique was perfected with elec. troacupuncture and used routinely Palos recognizes that the way the Chinese report their cures and research findings is unsatisfactory to Occidental doctors (although how unsatisfactory he is only partly aware, as shown by occasional naivet\u00e9 on his part). On their behalf, he begs for patience: \"It is only now that China is becoming more closely acquainted with the methodology of a system based on scientific principles. For this reason, competent experts must, for the time being, treat any submitted data with critical reserve.\" The evidence so far offered for the existence of the T'chi system is unconvincing to American scientists. So far! After an overprotected childhood, and an anarchistic adolescence, Chinese traditional medicine is on the verge of a vigorous and disciplined adulthood. It may well be, as some practitioners believe, that the latter half of the 20th century will one day be called the Golden Age of Acupuncture. "}
