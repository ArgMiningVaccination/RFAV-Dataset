Like all academic libraries of the 21st century, UMDNJ's Libraries are hybrid facilities to an ever increasing extent, preserving past knowledge while offering the latest resources, services and information technology. To do this well necessitates acquiring extensive and appropriate resources, enabling ready and straightforward access to them, and using both traditional and cutting-edge methods of acquisition, access and delivery of service to users. Technology and access to information are being transformed at a pace that requires dynamic research libraries to be more nimble and flexible than ever before. New emphases in research and teaching, and the heightened expectations of the UMDNJ user community require that the libraries are proactive in anticipating needs, customizing information services that respond to user requirements, and designing facilities that enable new kinds of interaction. The UMDNJ Libraries embrace the 21st century concept of knowledge management. These include the systems and processes used to acquire, organize, store, access, retrieve, teach and disseminate knowledge and information in all formats - traditional and digital. The University Libraries provide a critical portal where scholarship in all formats is discovered and used, where collaborative education takes place, and where students, faculty and staff can find the expert assistance of highly trained librarians. The scholarly resources made available by the UMDNJ Libraries, combined with effective knowledge management, are crucial competitive assets in an era of massive change in health care and information technology. Providing access to scholarly resources and information services to students, housestaff, faculty, and staff is the University Libraries' primary goal. The Libraries are continually expanding information access, in pa rticular, to electronic scholarly resources available onsite and remotely. The Libraries provide access to 94 electronic databases, 427 major electronic textbooks in the health sciences and over 10,615 of the most highly rated scholarly electronic journals. Utilization of licensed electronic resources, online books and journals in full-text, is growing monthly. Beginning in January 2007, the University Libraries are more aggressively supporting electronic journal subscriptions while eliminating large numbers of print journals. As a result of this reduction, the University Libraries attempt to address the ongoing need for new electronic content and archival collections . Collectively, the University Libraries have canceled print subscriptions to over 700 unique journal titles, while only losing access to 55 little used print subscriptions. The reduction in print subscriptions insures the Libraries' ability to continue providing access to the electronic versions of the journals. Currently, all UMDNJ libraries are wireless env ironments, providing flexible learning and study spaces for all users. New technologies are currently being implemented that will enhance library services to the University community. These include expanding access to electronic resources using open-link/URL technology through a comprehensive knowledge base called SFX and deploying federated search capability enabling searches of multiple resources simultaneously. 28 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 The UMDNJ Libraries are active participants in the New Jersey Knowledge Initiative, a New Jersey State Library funded program, which provides access to high-end life sciences electronic scholarly resources to New Jersey's academic libraries and over 300 biotechnology, start-up and incubator businesses. Through the Knowledge Initiative, the libraries have an expanded role in New Jersey's economic development by providing the best available resources to our rese archers, clinicians, and students. The UMDNJ Libraries contribute to UMDNJ's community services goals and the reality of Internet medicine through HealthyNJ, an extensive consumer health website (http://www.healthynj.org ). HealthyNJ assists consumers in their quest to rapidly find patient/consumer information tailored to a wide range of cultural, educational, and language needs. Currently, there are 400 total topics in the Diseases and Conditions and Health and Wellness portals. Of these, over 200 topics are fully available in Spanish. The site has recently been enhanced with \"Read Me First\" entries resulting in more widespread use.

Data as of October 1, 2006 101UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 FACULTY MASTER EDUCATORS' PROGRAM AT UMDNJ BACKGROUND Purpose: Although education is the primary mission of the University, faculty members often garner greater recognition internally and externally for their research and clinical accomplishments than their excellence as ed ucators. This paradox is by no means unique to UMDNJ, but quite common in academic health centers, in which excellence in education often is subordinated to research and clinical achievements in promotion and tenure decisions. To emphasize the value placed upon faculty excellence in teaching, consistent with the University's strategic goals, Dr. Stuart Cook formally launched the Master Educators' Program at UMDNJ at his inauguration on April 9, 1999. Shortly thereafter, a University-wide committee chaired by the Dean of the UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions (SHRP) was convened to determine the scope of the program and the general criteria to be employed in selecting Master Educators throughout the Schools of the University. The committee recommended the creation of a UMDNJ Master Educators' Guild, charged to help the University forge excellence in education throughout its Schools and to provide leadership in the continuous improvement of the teaching/learning continuum of the University's educational mission through educational scholarship, research and innovation. In June 2004, the Guild was officially named the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild, in honor of its founder. The Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educator Award recognizes faculty members for a commitment to excellence in education as demonstrated over a long period of time. It moves beyond the concept of excellence in teaching to the more global concept of education, which includes the considerations of learning and teaching styles, and the multiple settings in which education occurs at UMDNJ. Toward this purpose, the recipients of the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educator Award are expected to work together in the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild to continuously improve education at UMDNJ. Through a formal structure and bylaws that were first approved in September 2001 and revised in 2005, the Guild provides a stable foundation and home for the Master Educators to bring their influence to bear on the improvement of education throughout the Schools of UMDNJ and to share this expertise with educators in health sciences venues across the nation. Criteria: Nominees for Master Educator designation must demonstrate: Exceptional teaching skills in either a traditional modality of education (lecture, laboratory or clinical teaching) or an alternative form of teaching such as web-based education or another form of distance learning. Creativity in curricular design or innovation in the delivery of education to students; currency in knowledge. The requisite level of scholarship. Efficiency and effectiveness in teaching. The ability to engender enthusiasm among students, such that they are motivated to master the relevant subject matter or clinical competency. High regard as an excellent educator by his/her peers. 102 FACULTY UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 Within these general University-wide guide lines, each School of UMDNJ has developed specific criteria for selection and has established a Master Educator Review Committee comprising faculty, students and faculty administrators. ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO DATE Induction of Guild Members : In September 2000, the first 12 Master Educators were selected and inducted into the newly formed Master Educators' Guild. Additional classes have been inducted annually, with a curr ent total of over 66 members from the eight Schools of the University. It is a diverse group with regard to professional background and focus, and in 2006 the first librarian was inducted. The next class of Master Educators will be inducted on University Day, September 18, 2007. The Guild is actively engaged in several projects, described below. Online Center for Excellence in Health Sciences Education and Teaching (http://cte.umdnj.edu ): This Center, which helps the Guild achieve its role in promoting educational excellence through the innovative use of information technologies, was established and funded through the University 's Educational Technology Mini-Grant Program. The Center has three primary goals: to support, promote and enhance School and University-wide faculty development, furthering collaboration across the University by overcoming the barriers of time and place; to serve as a comprehensive resource center for the health sciences teaching community at large, projecting the University's educational expertise outward to the worldwide Internet community; and to provide a \"virtual home\" for the Master Educators' Guild. Officially launched during the 2004 University Day ceremonies, the Center's website provides a venue for the following activities: Coordinate and disseminate information on faculty development opportunities provided by the UMDNJ Schools (via an interactive online calendar). Provide University-wide mentoring and consultation services (via a new faculty mentoring program, a searchable database of faculty consultants, and a consultation discussion forum). Offer selected online programming of broad interest and appeal (via WebCT courses/tutorials). Publish and provide desk-top delivery of regular features on selected teaching and learning topics (e.g., educational technology, student evaluation, problem-based learning, clinical education, etc.). Serve as a dynamic repository of scholarly information on teaching and learning in the health professions (via provision of prestructured PubMed bibliographic queries and a large searchable database of relevant educational literature). Serve as a gateway to related sites (including other online University teaching centers and education and technology e-journals). Provide opportunities for external enrollment in selected online courses and tutorials offered by the University and/or Guild. Serve as the Guild's electronic archiv es, providing background information on the Guild, its origin, purpose, history and achievements. Provide a Guild Gallery, to include members' biographies and links to their research/scholarship. Furnish a gateway to the Guild's collaborative intranet. 103 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 FACULTY Use of the Center for Teaching Excellence is robust. It was visited over 30,000 times from May to June, 2007, representing a 92% increase in visits over last year. Visitors came from all six populated continents, with 86 percent being new to the Center and 14 percent being return users. Most external visitors found the Center via a Google search. All sections of the web site saw an increase in pageviews over last year. Active Learning was the most visited section of the Center, followed in order by Student Evaluation, Clinical Education, Traditional Teaching, Career Development and the Technology Corner. Faculty Mentoring Initiative: Academic Mentoring is a major initiative of the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild, reflecting the conviction of the members of the Guild that an organized system of mentoring will promote educational improvement across the University. The Guild already prov ides informational resources on mentoring through its Online Center, and has developed draft recommendations and guidelines on faculty mentoring. The guidelines first provide an overview of successful mentoring models, including the roles and responsibilities of both mentors and mentees. They then focus on mentoring at UMDNJ, including structure, responsibilities, incentives, evaluation and the role of the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild in the process. Academic Integrity Initiative: In association with the theme of Academic Integrity selected by the Master Educators' Guild for its AY 2005-2006 Grand Rounds and Symposium (see below), the Guild formed a new Committee on Academic Integrity. The Committee has gathered data from all Schools to determine the current status of academic integrity and activities designed to foster academic integrity at UMDNJ; analyzed the existing honor codes and codes of ethics of each School; and prepared the first draft of a \"white paper\" that presents recommendations for unification or standardization of guidelines among all Schools. The Committee will finalize its recommendations by the fall of 2007, before disseminating the document to the UMDNJ President and Academic Deans for review/adoption. Annual Master Educators' Guild Symposia: Since 2002, the Guild has sponsored a series of annual symposia open to all faculty of the University on topics it believes to be integral to its purposes. Each has featured a distinguished keynote speaker as well as workshops, demonstrations, discussion groups or poster sessions led by Master Educators and other faculty members. Themes have included educational technology, academic mentoring, the scholarship of teaching and learning, collaboration and interdisciplinary education, and academic integrity. In 2007, the Guild partnered with the NJEDge.Net and the UMDNJ Informatics Institute in hosting a conference entitled Best Practices Showcase: Integrating Technology into Learning. Annual University Day Educational Grand Rounds: Beginning in 2003, the Master Educators' Guild instituted another innovative approach to the attainment of its mission: Educational Grand Rounds during the annual University Day program in September. Topics generally complement the theme for the spring symposium, and have included professionalism among health care providers, integrating professional education and facilitating collaboration through mentoring, and academic integrity. 104 FACULTY UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 ENDOWED CHAIRS UMDNJ-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL Wesley J.

The University offers a myriad of programs and activities that serve our State and advance the health and quality of life of its residents. By providing more than 240 community service programs throughout the State, UMDNJ extends prevention, health care and related services to all of New Jersey's communities. Many of these programs target medically needy populations or those at high risk of particular health problems. A Community Resource Directory outlining all major community programs, activities and initiatives offered to the public, including health promotion, disease prevention, educational enrichment, neighborhood development and economic empowerment, is on UMDNJ's Ur ban and Community Development Website: www.umdnj.edu/comreweb . All of the Schools of UMDNJ provide students with opportunities for clinical education in community-based programs and settings, and foster cultural sensitivity and competence. Many sponsored research programs at UM DNJ focus on New Jersey's most urgent health problems. University faculty and scientists are helping to advance prevention and treatment in such areas as cancer; the effects of environmental agents on human health; biodefense; HIV/AIDS; tuberculosis; heart disease; mental health; oral health; health disparities; and aging. UMDNJ faculty and staff also participate in numerous boards and organizations, volunteering many hours to address health, education and other issues affecting New Jersey. UMDNJ's commitment to public service is further exemplified by our substantial employment of urban and minority residents, the purchase of goods and services from minority-owned and special vendors, and partnerships with community-based organizations. These activities contribute to the redevelopment and economic growth of the cities and regions that host the University's campuses. Provided here are highlights of a few of the many University programs and services that continue to make a positive impact in New Jersey.

The program also provides community service presentations to well over 1,000 participants at over 30 locations. ANNUAL ALZHEIMER'S CAREGIVERS CONFERENCE (SOM) Each year the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging (NJISA) and the New Jersey Geriatric Education Center, in collaboration with the Delaware Valley Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, provides faculty support for this large seven-county program for caregivers of those with Alzheimer's disease in Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, Cumberland, Salem, Atlantic, and Cape May counties. The program is attended by more than 250 caregivers and family members of those with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia. In 2006, Dr. Steven Dinsmore and Dr. Robert Nagele were the keynote speakers at the conference, which was hosted on the Stratford campus of UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine. The New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging will host the Caregivers' Conference on the Stratford campus of SOM in November 2007. ASIAN RISK ASSESSMENT COURSE (SPH) In collaboration with New Jersey Institute of Technology, the UMDNJ-School of Public Health taught environmental risk assessment in a month-long course funded by the Asian Development Bank. This was the fifth year that the course was taught in Bangkok, Thailand at Chulalongkorn University. The School also continues to assist the faculty at Prince of Songkla University in Hat Yai, Thailand in furthering development of the Center for Toxicology and Risk Management, which was established in 2001. Through collaborative funding from the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UMDNJ, two studies have been initiated in Southern Thailand looking at lead and arsenic contamination in children in two villages working with the Prince of Songkla University faculty. For more information on this project contact Dr. Mark Robson at robsonma@umdnj.edu . BRAIN AND MEMORY PROGRAM (SOM) Funded by the Wallerstein Foundation, Shop-Rite LPGA and the New Jersey Foundation on Aging, SOM New Jersey Institute for Succe ssful Aging continues to provide programs for community residents in Burlington County, Camden County, Essex County, East Orange, Morris County, and Jamesburg. Sessions are publicly advertised and promoted through local service groups, such as the Rotary, JCC, Lions Clubs, Eldermed (Kennedy Health System), and senior centers and church groups. The program includes brain health, activities to improve memory, and nutrition and exercise. In addition to keeping mind and body healthy, the focus is to increase awareness of the importance of early evaluation of memory problems. This outreach 118 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 effort, launched in September 2004, targets the 55+ age group and also serves a large church-affiliated minority population in Camden County. CAMDEN CITY HEALTHY FUTURES COMMITTEE and CITY OF CAMDEN COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROJECT (SPH) The Camden City Healthy Futures Committee, whose membership includes representation from the UMDNJ-School of Public Health, the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine and the SPH's Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, is dedicated to improving the health of the ci tizens of Camden. The objectives of the Committee are to \"promote a continuing dialogue among Camden health care and other organizations\" and \"initiate a process that promotes a sustainable network for future joint planning and health delivery in the city.\" SPH faculty and students on the Stratford/Camden Campus continued to assist the Camden City Healthy Futures Committee in conducting a community health assessment. With the support of the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, students this year completed focus groups with key constituent groups in the city to learn about health issues. Students also completed key informant interviews with city representatives and analyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance data for the city. All data are being compiled and shared with the Committee. For more information on this project contact Dr. Bernadette West at westbm@umdnj.edu , Dr. Marcia Sass at sassmm@umdnj.edu or Dr. Sherry Pomerantz at pomerash@umdnj.edu . CAMDEN CITY SENIOR HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROJECT (SPH) With funding from the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, faculty and students have initiated a senior health needs assessment in the city of Camden. Students are conducting 100 in-person interviews with at-risk seniors to explore health concerns, barriers to care and ways in which seniors tackle these barriers. Interviews are being conducted in four senior buildings in the city. CAMDEN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (SN) In 1999, the UMDNJ-School of Nursing established a Community Health Center (CHC) in Camden, New Jersey. The CHC was developed as an integral clinical component of the School, complete with faculty-endorsed vision, mission and value statements. The CHC receives financial support from an endowment awarded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and from the School of Nursing directly. The CHC is a joint venture of the UMDNJ-School of Nursing and the Camden County Council on Economic Opportunity (CCCOEO). CCCOEO invited the participation of the School of Nursing to include health care in its array of services offered to Camden residents. The services provided include primary care with referrals to local acute care facilities, health screening programs, and education and advocacy efforts. The majority served are either uninsured employed resi dents or Medicaid unemployed residents. Collaboration provides the sustaining foundation of the CHC. The primary relationship with CCCOEO is the mainstay partnership that feeds the Center with employee referrals and indirect funding. Clinical collaborations include the following: 1) CamCare, a local 119 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES ambulatory practice center; 2) Camden Department of Health Immunization Programs; 3) Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey; 4) UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine three-hour Saturday clinic providing services to both children and adults; and 5) the Hispanic Family Center. CHC provides clinical and screening efforts at the following sites on a regular basis: 1) CCCOEO headquarters; 2) Head Start Program; 3) the Hispanic Family Center; and 4) the Urban Women's Center. These health screenings focus on detection of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, anemia, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and tuberculosis. In addition, adults with acute episodic health problems and those requiring phy sical examinations are also cared for at the CHC. Since its establishment, the CHC continues to be an invaluable resource to Camden city residents. Hundreds of patient contacts ar e made annually by CHC staff, and its reach is expanding through partnerships with community service organizations. For both nursing students and students of osteopathic medicine, the CHC provides essential learning regarding the delivery of community services at a very local level. CAMDEN COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES CENTER AT LAKELAND (SOM) A SOM New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging geriatrician, Ira Cuttler, M.D., continues to provide primary care medical services to more than 260 residents at the county long-term care facility at Lakeland, with a total of 2,404 visits logged in 2005-2006. This facility is 99% Medicaid supported. THE CAMDEN SATURDAY HEALTH CLINIC (SOM) This initiative was funded in June 2004 by a \"Caring for Community\" grant award from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), in collaboration with the Pfizer Medical Humanities Initiative. SOM was one of only eight medical schools in the country to win this award. The primary goal of the clinic, which is held every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., is to provide urgent, primary and preventative health care, as well as health education, to the medically underserved population of Camden. To foster an interdisciplinary environment, the Camden Saturday Health Clinic (CSHC) is managed and operated by SOM students in collaboration with practitioners from an array of health care disciplines. Patients are seen by appointment or on a walk-in basis by a team of two medical students, who perform the initial exam/assessment of the patient. An attending physician from the SOM Family Medicine Department then sees the patient and guides the team to develop a treatment plan. Services offered include acute care for walk-ins; immunizations; school physicals; gynecological testing and HIV testing and counseling; STD education; screening tests for chronic diseases (i.e., high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, asthma, anemia, and depression); chronic disease management; and health education. Not only does the CSHC provide service to the community, but it also promotes cultural awareness and interdisciplinary experiences for medical students as part of their educational experience. The CSHC is supported by school-sponsored fundraising events, as well as grants and donations. 120 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY (RWJMS) The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) is committed to expanding its capacity to provide exceptional and innovative outreac h to New Jersey's medically underserved populations. The CINJ Office of Community Outreach works in conjunction with the Gallo Prostate Cancer Center, the Middlesex Count ry Cancer Coalition, the Healthier New Brunswick 2010 Community Health Advisory Group, and the New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection Coalition to meet the cancer education and outreach needs of its community constituents. Outreach activities include breast, prostate, cervical, lung, and skin cancer screenings; cancer prevention programs; and informative treatment-related lectures to community organizations. The Novartis Outreach and Education Project Established in 1998 with a grant from Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, the goal of the Novartis Outreach and Education Project at CINJ is to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of the statewide cancer research clinical trial population. The project combines target outreach and education efforts to both the medically underserved and health care provider segments of New Jersey. The proj ect provides seed funds and program support to cancer education and outreach programs already working with various communities throughout the State. This innovative program provides technical and grant support to help communities become self-sustaining partners in providing their own cancer education and awareness. The program facilitates increased knowledge and trust, both of which have been shown to be major barriers to cancer clinical trial participation for members of medically underserved groups. Current grantees are serving the medically underserved, advanced stage cancer patients, African Americans, and Hispanics throughout the entire state of New Jersey. The Dean and Betty Gallo Prostate Cancer Center The Center has developed many strong community ties that have been instrumental in increasing prostate cancer screening and education programs throughout the State, including screenings held at churches, clinics, and village gatherings and advertised through local papers, radio stations, bulletins, food stores, and community centers. Continuing Umbrella for Research Education The Continuing Umbrella for Research Educat ion (CURE), originally established in 2003 with a grant from the National Cancer Institute, is now funded by Johnson & Johnson. The program enrolls eight students each year - four from Rutgers and four from the New Brunswick Health Science Technology High School - to conduct research at CINJ. Running for two summers and the academic year in between, the program provides students with an excellent opportunity to experience the research environment and develop and pursue opportunities for careers in science. Health Disparity Tumor Study Group Comprised of physicians, researchers, nurses, and experts in public health, healthcare administration and tumor registry, the charter of this group was to complement our community outreach efforts with focused research on healthcare disparities issues, with the express purpose of using outcomes data to direct and monitor our community outreach efforts. During the past six months, we have concentrated our efforts on identifying reliable data sources to ask specific questions regarding the extent of our outreach programs and cancer care delivery within multiple populations and 121 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES strengthened collaborations with our colleagues at the New Jersey Medical School and School of Public Health who are national experts in health disparities research. Other CINJ Activities A patient-relief fund was established with patient donations to assist with transportation, parking, etc., for indigent individuals. CINJ is active in New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection, a CDC sponsored program that provides cancer screenings in all 21 New Jersey counties for uninsured individuals. CINJ collaborates with the NJ Commission on Cancer Research and the American Cancer Society on a project funded by Aventis entitled IMPACT, Improving Minority and Medically Underserved Participation and Access in Clinical Trials . It is targeted to the Newark, Camden, Trenton, Jersey City, and Paterson communities. In collaboration with the New Jersey Health Disparities Institute, CINJ sponsored a statewide symposium entitled \"Tackling Cancer Disparities in New Jersey.\" Drs. Ronald Morton and Diane Brown received a grant funded by NIH to develop a \"Center of Excellence in Health Disparities in New Jersey\" through the National Center on Minority Health Disparities. CINJ collaborates with the UMDNJ-School of Public Health on a grant to identify barriers to participation in cancer clinical trials among African Americans and Hispanics in New Jersey. CINJ Office of Community Outreach is active in the development of an educational DVD to increase awareness and knowledge of colorectal cancer screening. CINJ Office of Community Outreach is active in the development of clinician- friendly screening guideline pocket guides for breast, prostate, cervical, and colorectal cancer. CARES INSTITUTE (SOM) In addition to providing state-of-the-art medical and mental health services to children and families who have experienced child abuse and neglect, the Child Abuse Research Education and Service (CARES) Institute at SOM provides a wide variety of training and educational services to the community. These opportunities are directed towards children, parents, teachers, social workers, law enforcement, mental health clinicians and medical professionals. Below is a list of training and educational activities for fiscal year 2007: July 2006 Communicating with Children August 2006 Introduction to Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Combined Parent-Child Cognitive Behavioral Therapy September 2006 Expert Lecture Series: Challenges in Differentiating SIDS, Positional Sleep and Suffocation Deaths in Infants Body Safety for Kids 122 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 \"Okay\" and \"Not Okay\" Touches for Kids October 2006 Understanding & Addressing the Needs of Children who have Suffered Abuse Mental Health Needs of Children in Foster Care November 2006 Law Enforcement Overview of Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Services Body Safety & Preventing Child Sexual Abuse for Parents December 2006 Expert Lecture Series: Investigating and Prosecuting Serious Physical Abuse and Child Homicide Body Safety & Preventing Child Sexual Abuse for Parents Child Abuse Awareness January 2007 Overview of Burn Injuries for Law Enforcement Overview of Sexually Transmitted Infections for Law Enforcement February 2007 Medical Indicators of Child Physical and Sexual Abuse Sexual Harassment Awareness March 2007 Trauma and Delinquency 3rd Annual Best Practice Symposium: Meeting the Medical and Mental Health Needs of Children in Foster Care Date Rape Awareness Overview of Failure to Thrive for Law Enforcement April 2007 Physician's Role in Substantiating Child Sexual Abuse Overview of Shaken Baby Syndrome for Child Protection Overview of Bruising for Child Protection Overview of Medical Diagnosis of Child Sexual Abuse for Child Protection Skeletal Injuries in Child Abuse for Child Protection Overview of Burns in Child Abuse for Child Protection June 2007 Panel Discussion: Response of the Social Systems and the Legal Systems Concerning Children Exposed to Domestic Violence Expert Lecture Series: The Nature of Nurture: Biology, Environment, and the Drug Exposed Child Expert Lecture Series: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Traumatic Grief CENTER FOR BIODEFENSE (NJMS) UMDNJ established the Center for BioDefense in 1999 in anticipation of bioterrorism attacks taking place in the United States. Since its founding, the Center has grown into a leading entity in the area of counter-terrorism, biodefense and emergency management. In light of the terrorist attacks in 2001, and of the President's commitment to protect America against future attacks, we are proud that New Jersey is able to join national efforts through the Center for BioDefense at UMDNJ. The breadth of the projects that the Center is supporting demonstrates the Center's close relationship with State efforts to increase New Jersey's state of preparedness. In addition, New Jersey's Congressional support to the Center guarantees that the citizens, residents and visitors 123 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES to this State will be able to react and respond to terrorism and other disasters. In a short period of time, the Center has gained a state and national reputation for its leadership and rapid response to the new age of bioterrorism. Since October 2001, members of the Center have embarked on an ambitious schedule of seminars, conferences, and other training sessions to educate scientists, clinicians, first responders, public health professionals, and the general public on terrorism and biodefense. CENTER FOR HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY (SPH) The School of Public Health's Center for Health Economics and Health Policy collaborates with the Rutgers University-Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research to present the Wednesday Noon Health Economics Seminar Series. Presentation topics for this past year included: Does Dual Medicare/VHA Use Improve Outcomes of Diabetes Care? The Health Care Safety Net and Crowd-Out of Private Health Insurance Medicaid Physician Fees and the Quality of Care of Medicaid Patients Crime and Circumstance: The Effect of Infant Health Shocks on Fathers' Criminal Activity Risk Preference Formation and Risky Behaviors in Adolescence and Adulthood: The Importance of Neighborhood and Family Background CENTER FOR SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION (SPH) The Center for School and Community Health Education (CSCHE), headquartered in New Brunswick, follows a mission to empower diverse populations to make informed decisions about their health through innovative outreach, creative partnerships and applied research. CSCHE translates leading scientific research into comprehensive educational materials through several outreach initiatives including professional development; curriculum development; w ebsite development for: classroom enhancement and parental involvement; the Safe Schools Program; and community outreach. Professional Development Training workshops support the use of CSCHE materials and the integration of health- based topics into school curricula. Through hands-on workshops, participants experience the curricular materials as both students and teachers, promoting teachers as learners. Participants familiarize themselves with the activities, discovering how the lessons and activities are interrelated and build upon one another, ultimately preparing them for the classroom. CSCHE workshops are designed to meet the specific needs of each target audience. To achieve this goal, CSCHE employs several teacher training models, including national train-the-trainer programs; regional teacher workshops held primarily during the summer; and both short- and long-term district collaborations to train all teachers at a specific grade level(s). To date, CSCHE's programs and services have impacted more than 7,200 teachers and 140,000 students in 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and overseas. Train-the-Trainer Programs: Using a train-the-trainer approach to increase the number of people who have the capacity to train teachers on select curricula is the most efficient method for ensuring nationwide curriculum dissemination through professional 124 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 development. This mechanism greatly increa ses the number of teachers/students impacted when compared to one organization acting alone. These programs may involve the collaboration of several school districts, educational/environmental organizations and universities' education and outreach programs. Trainers are trained to facilitate workshops for teachers in their area focusing on health-related curricula. Regional Teachers Workshops: The annual Environmental Health Sciences Summer Institute for Educators, Grades K-12, continues to meet the needs of teachers throughout New Jersey. The Summer Institute offers workshops facilitated by CSCHE staff and health educators, scientists and classroom teachers. The thirteenth annual Summer Institute, held in summer 2006, welcomed 116 educators representing 49 districts in the public and private sectors, who participated in five one- and multi-day workshops. Workshop topics included toxi cology, risk assessment, epidemiology, infectious diseases, real-life science and safe work practices for teenagers. District-Specific Teacher Workshops: With support from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), CSCHE has conducted the seven-year SUC 2ES 2 (Students Understanding Critical Connections between the Environment, Society and Self) program since 2000. SUC 2ES 2 represents a partnership between CSCHE and the Woodbridge Township School District, in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Education, the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University and Rider University. The goal is to develop three integrative, environmental health units, one for each of the district's second, fifth and seventh grades, based on the award-winning ToxRAP (Toxicology, Risk Assessment and Pollution) curriculum series. A critical project component is the implementation of a comprehensive evaluation of the ToxRAP materials and additional activities. This evaluation will determine the effectiveness of the curriculum in increasing environmental health literacy and in improving science attitudes among students. To date, all three curriculum guides have been developed and implemented in all of the district's elementary and middle schools. Student pre- and post-tests were conducted in treatment and comparison schools at each of the district's three grade levels. Preliminary results for second and fifth grades continue to show significant improvement in student learning. Curriculum Development Lesson plans containing current and impartial information increase public health literacy, with an emphasis on environmental health, while enhancing educational resources in elementary, secondary and vocational school classrooms (grades K-12). Teaching techniques include problem-based learning, games, graphing, hands-on experiments and case studies. Age-appropriate investigative science, math, health and language arts activities present students with real-life scenarios through which they learn problem-solving, decision-making and critical-thinking skills. These tools for learning are readily transferable to other areas of students' lives. Select modules are also available in Spanish-bilingual and all-Spanish versions. Materials, where applicable, are indexed to state and national education standards. Working with the LIFE Center at The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (LPGA Pros in the Fight to Eradicate Breast Cancer), CSCHE is developing the ToxRAP Breast Cancer module. The module will enable both female and male high school students, through the process of scientific inquiry, to identify risk factors for breast cancer; learn how cancer develops; and make life-style changes to reduce the risk of cancer. The module will primarily target science classrooms. Following the ToxRAP model, students will be given 125 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES a case study involving a family where one person has breast cancer based on a composite of real cases. Students will help the family work through all of the associated scientific and psychological issues as the family moves through diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Safe Schools Safe Schools is a project supported by the New Jersey Department of Education, Office of Vocational-Technical, Career and Innovative Programs, to assist schools in reducing risk due to occupational safety and health hazards. Safe Schools involves a number of outreach components designed to support teachers, administrators, safety and health designees, structured learning experience/career orientation coordinators, county apprenticeship coordinators, cooperative education coordinators and those involved in school-to-careers. As one of its components, project staff developed recommendations through a Safe Schools Program Task Force for the New Jersey Department of Education and the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development regarding prohibited and restricted hazardous healthcare work activities for minors (youth under the age of 18) involved in school-sponsored structured learning experiences. These recommendations will guide revisions to New Jersey child labor laws. In addition, 1,254 teachers and administrators in New Jersey were trained during 68 courses focusing on occupational safety and health issues through the Safe Schools Program. Much of the training focused on preparing participants to meet the new teacher licensing requirements related to ensuring students associated with school-sponsored structured learning experiences are placed at safe work sites. Community Outreach The five-year HOPE Partnership (Health Observances and Public Education), made possible with funding from the National Center for Research Resources, represents a collaboration of seven universities. The HOPE Partnership concentrates on three established national health observances that focus on diseases, ill nesses or ailments to which a majority of the population can relate: Cancer Control Month, Allergy and Asthma Awareness Month and Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. Partners are developing, implementing and evaluating outreach program s that contain educational materials designed to raise public awareness of how research is leading towards the prevention, detection and/or treatment of diseases/illnesses. The materials are being implemented through community learning, formal and informal education, the media, non-profit organization events and science centers/mu seums. Team members have completed more than 50 focus groups among project target audiences (middle and high school students and teachers and the general public) to help guide the development of the educational materials. The Health Observance Package for Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month (held every May) was review ed by target audiences and implemented in spring 2007. The educational materials for Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (nationally observed the third week of October) were reviewed by target audiences and implemented in fall 2006; materials for Cancer Control Month are under development. CSCHE is partnering with Oregon State Universi ty, University of Arizona, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Southern California/University of California, Los Angeles, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and University of Wisconsin-Madison. 126 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 For more information on CSCHE programs and services, contact Laura Hemminger at hemminlb@umdnj.edu . CHARLES E. BRIMM MEDICAL ARTS HIGH SCHOOL (SOM) SOM Family Medicine third year students and residents participate in a program for the Medical Arts High School (located at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden) in which they discuss health-related issues with high school students, including potential careers in clinical medicine. The well-received program - part of the federal Kids in Health Care program - is being expanded to include more health prevention education programs for Camden's 7th and 8th graders by SOM Family Medicine physicians. Over the past five years, the SOM Family Medicine Department has also participated in Camden's Summer Medical Youth Program, which promotes careers in the health sciences. COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY (RWJMS) The UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has collaborated with Rutgers University and Seton Hall University in developing a number of programs aimed at increasing the enrollment of underrepresented minority students in medical school and the sciences. ACCESS-MED is a consortium program for undergraduates offered by Rutgers, Seton Hall, and RWJMS to provide academic enrichment, support and counseling for educationally and financially disadvantaged students pursuing health science careers. The Office of Special Academic Programs administers three summer programs that increase the diversity of biomedical researchers, physicians and other health care professionals: The Biomedical Careers Program is an eight-week joint RWJMS - Rutgers University program for educationally and financially disadvantaged undergraduate students interested in careers in medicine or other health professions. The RISE program, a collaboration involving RWJMS, Rutgers University Graduate School of Education and the UMDNJ-Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, is aimed at minority and disadvantaged students interested in careers in biomedical research. The Pre-matriculation Summer Program allows educationally or financially disadvantaged incoming medical students to preview selected topics in anatomy, biochemistry, and cell biology/histology. All of these programs, as well as RWJMS' affirmative action efforts, have contributed to the School's successful diversity efforts. RWJMS has had an average of 20% underrepresented minority student enrollment during the past five years. The School is also collecting data about faculty diversity and is actively seeking to increase the recruitment, retention and promotion of underrepresented minority and women faculty. In recognition of the School's commitment to improving the health of the communities served and to increasing diversity, RWJMS has developed specific strategic goals and objectives related to these areas. These goals and objectives are part of the School's five-year strategic planning process. To facilitate planning and implementation of 127 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES initiatives aimed at meeting these goals, the School has created two subcommittees, one for community health and the other for promoting diversity. Each committee has representation from faculty and administration. The community health subcommittee has community representatives as well. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER INSTITUTE (SOM) The Community Health Worker Institute (CHWI) was initially established by the Camden Area Health Education Center (AHEC) in 2000. In 2004, CHWI obtained federal funding through SOM from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-Health Resources and Services Administration for a Model State-Supported Area Health Education Center. It is one of only three statewide initiatives in the country aimed at developing the emerging profession of Community Health Worker (CHW). Based at SOM, the CHWI is administered through the Camden AHEC. Its goal is to enable medical and other health professions students in UMDNJ to gain knowledge about the potential of CHW's to improve health literacy; increase knowledge about cultural sensitivity and cultural competence in health care delivery; enhance quality of care; and provide diverse learning exper iences in underserved communities. The Institute has been working to facilitate identification of competencies/standards and training resources for community health workers that can be applied statewide, which will ultimately lead to clear identification of this important new occupation. On March 30, 2007, the CHWI hosted a statewide conference on the Stratford campus that was attended by 132 community health workers. COMMUNITY NUTRITION INITIATIVES (SHRP) Each year, the SHRP-Dietetic Internship Program has been involved in several community nutrition initiatives, and in 2007 these were targeted primarily to children and adolescents. Supermarket tours emphasizing shopping for a healthy heart were conducted with approximately 100 Trenton Central High School girls in conjunction with the Teen Esteem Program sponsored by the Women's Heart Foundation. In addition, culinary presentations and nutrition exhibits were presented to 120 high school freshman and sophomores from the Union County Academy of Health Sciences to celebrate National Nutrition Month. Finally \"You R What U Eat\" workshops were conducted for 180 Girl Scouts from the Delaware-Raritan Valley Girl Scout Council. COMMUNITY ORAL HEALTH AWARENESS DAY (NJDS) The New Jersey Dental School partnered with Essex County Dental Society and held its first Oral Health Community Awareness Day Fair at the Turtle Back Zoo on April 28, 2007. Fifty-five dental students and faculty volunteered for this community event. The goal of the event was to educate the public about effective dental care, oral cancer education and smoking cessation. Over 1,000 toothbrushes, toothpaste and floss were given away to encourage continued, or in many instances to begin, proper dental care. Volunteers also provided tooth brushing in struction and trivia questions about dental care along with a PowerPoint presentation on oral cancer prevention education. A tobacco dependence treatment specialist prov ided information on smoking cessation. Carnival games, arts and crafts and raffles that included many prizes made community oral health awareness day an educational and enjoyable day for all individuals. 128 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 THE COMMUNITY- ORIENTED DENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAM (NJDS) The Community-Oriented Dental Education Program (CODE) is in its twelfth year of having fourth-year pre-doctoral dental students deliver care under faculty supervision in NJDS's extramural dental centers in southern New Jersey. Students who move into the area near one of the community-based facilities participate in organized community projects throughout the year and come to Newark for didactic instruction one day each week. DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH (NJDS) The Department of Community Health provi ded oral health education programs for over 800 students, nursing home and community center participants at the following sites: Ridgewood Montessori School Congregation Israel Nursery School Kinnelon Public School Woodland School Integrity House Boys and Girls Club 13th Ave. School 14th Ave. School Newton Street School Miller Street School Camden Middle School Martin Luther King School Public School #48 Fellowship Farm School Beachwood Elementary School Ridgewood Montessori School Play & Grow, Somerset DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SYSTEMS & POLICY / DOMINICAN REPUBLIC HEALTH OUTREACH PROJECT (SPH) The Dominican Republic Health Project began in 2003 when nine students and two faculty members undertook public health projects in the Haitian bateyes of the Dominican Republic (DR). Bateyes are extremely poor communities of sugar cane workers and their families who live in primit ive palm frond and tin shacks with limited access to potable water and sanitary facilities and no access to health, social service or educational programs. Since that first visit, the Project has been expanded to represent the field work component of a new course, \"Public Health Applications in Developing Countries.\" In July of 2005, seven students traveled to the Dominican Republic with one faculty member; in January 2006, another 22 students and two faculty members traveled again to the DR. 129 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES The Dominican Republic Project is undertaken in collaboration with Crossroads, a non- denominational outreach mission that provides housing and nutritional programs to persons living in the bateyes of the North Coast of the Dominican Republic. Students and faculty plan specific public health interventions and obtain the resources necessary to implement them prior to their visit to the Dominican Republic. Typical projects include parasite control programs, primary care clinics, health education programs, and assistance in nutrition and sanitation projects. During the Project's existence, students have raised funds that have been used to: Purchase a cow to provide milk and a solar oven for bateye communities Build a water system in one bateye Construct a primary care center in a new village built by Crossroad Support an emergency medical fund Provide tuition for Haitian children to attend schools in the DR For more information on this project contact Dr. Lois Grau at graulo@umdnj.edu . DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FAMILY EDUCATION AND INFORMATION PROJECT (SPH) The Developmental Disabilities Family Education Project provides information and support to families of people with developmental disabilities who are making a transition from institutional to community living in New Jersey. Support for this Project is provided by the New Jersey Division of Developmental Disabilities. The Project engages families in choosing and helping to develop the most effective and viable community living options for their family members. Project activities include: Family Forums to provide families with a picture of the possibilities in community living. New Beginnings Family Meetings on transition to community living.

Since its inception in 1976, DAYAM has achieved its teaching, health care and research missions through a broad array of institutional, community-involved and community-based clinical services and psychosocial interventions. The scope of programs and services extends beyond direct clinical care to include prevention, education, advocacy and specific intervent ion and research in HIV and STDs, rape, 130 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 sexual abuse, substance use and abuse, truancy, school failure, violence and delinquency, adolescent mental health evaluation and counseling, adolescent gynecology and family planning. Currently, t he Division maintains a national reputation for its expertise in adolescent and young adult health care, and is the only inner city based comprehensive Adolescent Medicine Program in the State of New Jersey. DAYAM promotes the availability of efficacious responses to issues that adversely affect the quality of life of adolescents and young adults. Several projects focus on adolescent male development. The latter include Young Fathers Program, Male Student Support Program (MSSP) and the Waiting Room Parents Program. In addition, DAYAM has developed a coordinated approach that includes youth-specific HIV prevention, community-based youth-specific HIV counseling and testing, youth-specific HIV outreach, youth-specific HIV primary care and case management and adolescent HIV treatment systems research and evaluation. These include Peer Outreach Workers Educating Risk-takers (POWER), Spend Time on Prevention (STOP), Juveniles Understanding Methods of Prevention (JUMP), Screening, Treatment and Risk Reduction for Teens (START), Direct Service Outreach Initiative (DSOI), Services Targeting Adolescents Needing Direct Outreach (STAND), and DAYAM HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services. ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRACKING (SPH) SPH faculty members from the Department of Epidemiology serve on the Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Advisory Group. EPHT tracks the ongoing collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data on environmental hazards, exposures to those hazards, and health effects that may be related to the exposures. The goal of tracking is to provide information that can be used to plan, apply, and evaluate actions to prevent and control environmentally related diseases. This Advisory Group has been convened by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services to provide input and guidance on technical aspects of demonstration projects and communication of project findings to interested stakeholders and the public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded Environmental Public Health Tracking Program is led by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services in partnership with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. THE ERIC B. CHANDLER HEALTH CENTER (RWJMS) The Eric B. Chandler Health Center is the cornerstone of UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School community-based programs. Founded in 1987 in memory of Eric B. Chandler, Ed.D., it is owned and operated by the Medical School in collaboration with a Community Advisory Board. The Center is a comprehensive, family-oriented community facility dedicated to the provision of high quality ambulatory health care services to low- income, uninsured and underinsured residents of the Greater New Brunswick community. The Center is also a training facility for residents and medical students at RWJMS. Chandler received Federally Qualified Health Center status in 1991, and in 1993 was awarded PHS Section 330 community health center grant funding for the first time. Its mission is: 131 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES To provide high quality ambulatory health care services that are culturally effective. To promote a healthy lifestyle and educate patients to assume responsibility for and participate in their health care decisions. To provide high quality educational opportunities for medical students, residents, physicians, nursing and other health professional students who train at the Center. All trainees will learn to provide culturally effective, respectful, quality health care in the context of the community. To serve as a community resource for health and social services. The Center provides on-site primary care, internal medicine, pediatrics, and perinatal and gynecologic care, family planning, and preventive and restorative dental services to adults and children. Dental services for children in grades K through 5 are also provided at the Lord Stirling School in New Brunswick. In addition, the Center offers podiatry services, HIV counseling and testing services, laboratory services, and specialized care for people with HIV/AIDS. Social work staff, health educators, nutritionists, community outreach workers, and case managers contribute significantly to the Center's programs. With the support of a federal grant, in March 2006 the Chandler Health Center opened an Annex in New Brunswick to expand its services . The new facility, five blocks from the main building, responds to the need for more medical and dental services and health education for the underinsured and uninsured population of central New Jersey. With two medical and two dental examination rooms, a patient education room, and offices for support staff, the services at the Chandler Annex have eased the long backlogs for appointments at the main Chandler Center. As part of an academic health center, Chandler actively participates in training medical students, residents, nursing students, and social work students. Emphasis is placed on the use of a bio-psychosocial approach to patient care, with special attention given to helping learners understand the influences of poverty, poor education, cultural diversity and family structure on the delivery of effective patient care services. One of the primary goals of the Center is to teach learners about the unique issues that confront patients in an underserved urban setting. Each year over seventy residents and medical students rotate at Chandler. Internal medicine residents and pediatric residents are assigned to Chandler for their three years of continuity care experience. Ob/Gyn residents provide obstetrical care as well as continuity in gynecologic care. Medical students from the Homeless and Indigent Population Health Outreach Project (HIPHOP) rotate at the Center every eight to ten weeks. These students also participate in home visits with outreach workers. As part of its commitment to eliminating health disparities and improving clinical outcomes, the Center participates in the National Health Disparities Collaborative. Activities are designed to improve the overall care that each patient receives and to establish a process of improvement based on the Care Model. The Care Model fosters productive interactions between patients and a prepared practice team within a health care setting. The model is designed to maximize resources, use them effectively, and look towards the community for resources to help deliver evidence-based care. 132 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 The Center is also committed to the PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) method for accelerating the change process and improving work flow, patient care, and other activities at Chandler. As a community-based health center, Chandler also collaborates with local agencies to address both health and social needs. For example, Chandler regularly participates in community health fairs and projects sponsored by the Healthier New Brunswick 2010 Initiative. In addition to its core clinical services, Chandler has developed the following community-based programs: Family Education Program This outreach project features a series of health education seminars on topics such as domestic violence, immigration, managed care, home safety and health maintenance. Prenatal Classes A series of classes for pregnant women is offered in English and Spanish three times a year to provide information about normal pregnancy, what to expect during labor, and normal child development. A separate series of prenatal classes is offered for expectant adolescent mothers with additional topics such as continuing education after the baby's birth and preventing unplanned pregnancies. Reach Out and Read Program To encourage reading to children from an early age, the Chandler Center participates with the National Reach Out and Read Program cooperatively with Rutgers University. At every well child visit, children are given books that are appropriate for their developmental level. Health Information on Spanish Website The Chandler Center, with the support of the New Brunswick Interpreter Project, has just put its new Spanish language website online. This will make important health information more accessible and will provide a Spanish language guide to services available at Chandler. EVALUATION OF PRACTICING SAFETY, 2003 TO PRESENT (SPH) The Practicing Safety project \u2014a collaborative effort of UMDNJ and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), with funding by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation\u2014 completed its work with area pediatric practices to decrease child abuse and neglect by increasing anticipatory guidance given to parents of children under the age of four. SPH faculty and staff from the Health Systems and Policy Department were part of the Central Evaluation Team, which collected and analyzed quantitative and qualitative process and outcome data for the project. During this past year, the project completed its data collection efforts with the participating NJ and PA sites. This included gat hering surveys from physicians and staff on their use of the tools, gathering surveys from parents on their satisfaction with the materials, and reviewing medical records to determine if discussions are being documented during regular well child visits. For more information on this project contact Dr. Diane Abatemarco at dja17+@pitt.edu . 133 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES FOOD STAMP EDUCATION (SHRP) In conjunction with Rutgers University Cooper ative Extension, UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions has been providing nutrition education sessions for food stamp recipients in Essex County since 1998. The sessions are held in schools, after-school programs and community agencies.

The Child Health Program, a collaboration with the New Jersey State Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), Department of H ealth and Human Services (DHHS), works to ensure that the healthcare needs of vulnerable, at-risk children throughout New Jersey are met. The program collaborates with DYFS to develop a coordinated response to specific regional and statewide health needs by providing case management, consultation and continuing education to DYFS staff and caregivers for children in out-of-home placement. Pediatric AIDS Services The FXB Center is the largest and oldest pediatric HIV research and clinical care program in the U.S., having served over 1, 000 families predominantly from the Newark metropolitan area. The FXB Center is dedicate d to improving the lives of vulnerable families, including those infected and affected by HIV. 134 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 The FXB Center provides ongoing comprehensive, multidisciplinary, family-focused care and also offers access to new medications and investigational treatments to children through the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) program. The diverse care, outreach and education programs include two websites focused on healthcare providers (WomenChildrenHIV.org and aidsetc.org ) and two programs that implement effective strategies to engage HIV-positive women and HIV-exposed and infected children into care: The Family Place and Healthcare Connections. These activities, funded through multiple national and state government progr ams and private foundations, allow the FXB Center to address the social services, nursing, nutritional and emergency care needs of children and families in the Newark community, as well as to support national and international health education programs. Research Current projects include a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) training grant to disseminate and increase rapid HIV testing in labor and delivery. Several Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded initiatives focus on women's perspectives about approaches to HIV testing in pregnancy and understanding strategies to support implementation of recommendations for cervical cancer screening for women living with HIV infection. A recent National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)-funded investigation examined quality of life of children and youth with perinatally-acquired HIV infection and resulted in a publication in Pediatrics in 2005. Education The primary domestic education project is the HIV/AIDS National Resource Center (NRC) that serves the Ryan White Treatment Modernization Act-funded programs, the AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs) and the Title IV program. The NRC provides education, training and quality manag ement resources to health professionals caring for people living with HIV infection. It offers an online library of training resources, technical assistance, and materials on new and emerging clinical topics. Global Initiatives The FXB Center was the lead developer of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Infection (PMTCT) Generic Training Package, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the CDC. This Package is a comprehensive, evidence-based, capacity-building training pr ogram on PMTCT in resource-constrained settings designed to link and strengthen PMTC T services and training efforts. It is intended to be adapted by national PMTCT program staff to include country-specific policies, guidelines, and recommendations. The Generic Training Package is funded by the CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP) Universi ty Technical Assistan ce Project, which supports global education on HIV/AIDS. This project offers training and technical assistance to support capacity building and infrastructure development for direct care to families living with infectious and chronic diseases in resource-constrained settings. This includes training on PMTCT, family-centered care for individuals co-infected with TB and HIV, and palliative care and symptom management for individuals with chronic infectious diseases and life-limiting conditions. The Center has developed curricula and supportive materials for PMTCT and pediatric HIV management that have been adapted and implemented in diverse settings across the globe. Activities are ongoing in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The 23 in-country staff at the FXB Center UTAP project initiative in Guyana provide HIV care and treatment at all the public sites throughout the country. The FXB-Guyana 135 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES program also provides technical assistance to support the care of TB/HIV co-infected patients and the country's laboratory infrastructure. In Botswana, the FXB Center has developed a multi-system approach to healthcare provider staff retention to address the severe human capacity shortage. In addition to PMTCT healthcare provider education in Zanzibar and Tanzania, the Center is implementing several large-scale HIV/AIDS service delivery evaluation projects. In Kenya, the FXB Center is providing support to clinicians to facilitate the delivery of PMTCT services in line with the national guidelines. In Haiti, the FXB Center technical assistance team supports the development and implementation of pediatric HIV infection guidelines and education for pediatric healthcare providers. Since 2003, the FXB Center has been funded by PACTG to provide training at clinical research sites in resource-limited settings to support the conduct of clinical trials related to pediatric and perinatal HIV infection. The Center has continued this role as the clinical trials program transitioned to the International Maternal Pediatric and Adolescents AIDS Clinical Trials Program (IMPAACT) network. This initiative includes the development and implementation of HIV clin ical and research training for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, counselors, peer educators and Community Advisory Board members. Curricula and supportive materials for community HIV education and HIV nursing care have been developed and implemented in Thailand and several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. FREE ORAL CANCER SCREENING AT UMDNJ (NJDS) For the ninth year, volunteer faculty and community dentists performed free oral cancer examinations on New Jersey citizens with appropriate follow-up. Trained volunteer staff provided educational materials and instructions on lifestyle and habit changes to reduce the likelihood of developing oral cancer. The screenings were held in two locations in Somerdale and at the Dental School on April 26, 2007. The Newark screenings were performed in conjunction with the Essex County Cancer Fair, where all major cancer organizations had information booths. \"GIVE KIDS A SMILE\" DAY AT THE NEW JERSEY DENTAL SCHOOL (NJDS) The New Jersey Dental School (NJDS), in conjunction with the New Jersey Dental Association and the American Dental Association, hosted \"Give Kids a Smile Day.\" This special one-day annual event began in 2003 and is part of a national month-long Children's Dental Health Month. Offered at no cost to New Jersey youngsters ages 12 and under, the event allows the dental community to treat thousands of underserved children. NJDS volunteers, including dent ists, hygienists, dental assistants and non- clinical support staff, as well as community dentists, performed a wide range of dental services. Throughout the day a circus clown entertained the children while they awaited treatment. Tables were filled with educational activities, and face painting, balloon art, and other games were enjoyed. The total number of children treated has more than doubled since 2003. In 2004, 280 children were treated, and in 2005, 535 were treated. This year NJDS provided care to over 800 children, including patients registered for the day and walk-ins, as well as over 300 children from the Statewide Network for Community Oral Health. 136 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS INSTITUTE (NJMS) The UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School Global Tuberculosis Institute is a force in the effort to conquer and cure tuberculosis worldwide. The Institute plays a leading role in the international arena, providing experti se in program development, education and training, and research to ministers of health, national TB programs and healthcare providers around the globe. A History of Excellence TB infections in the U.S. soared to unprecedented levels in the early 1990s. The UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center was established in 1993 in response to this resurgence. Under the direction of Lee B. Reichman, MD, MPH, it achieved federal designation as a national Model Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Center in 1994, indicating its success in delivering state-of-the-art treatment, conducting cutting-edge research, and providing education and training to all levels of health care providers as well as those afflicted with this deadly, yet curable, disease. To reflect this ever-expanding commitment to stamp out the disease even in the most remote locales, the Center changed its name to the Global Tuberculosis Institute in early 2006. Mission and Goals The mission of the Global Tuberculosis Institute is to advance state-of-the-art tuberculosis care through excellence in research, practice and teaching. The goals of the Institute are to decrease tuberculosis morbidity through state-of-the-art diagnostic, treatment and prevention programs; to create a cadre of interacting clinical and research scientists with a prime interest in the intersection of basic science, clinical and epidemiological aspects of tuberculosis; to develop and apply innovative diagnostic, therapeutic, behavioral, preventive and educational modalities for tuberculosis and to provide an internationally recognized training center for courses and affiliations at all levels to increase the skills related to tuberculosis for physicians, nurses, epidemiologists and all other health-related professions. The Global Tuberculosis Institute's success has been achieved through the realization of these goals. The Institute has developed proven effective practices, which are shared with others involved in the fight against tuberculosis. State-of-the-Art Care The Institute provides outpatient services at its new state-of-the-art clinical facility designed from the ground up specifically for safe and effective treatment of tuberculosis. Renowned pulmonary and infectious disease specialists treat patients in the Waymon C. Lattimore Practice. Patient-centered care is provided through a multi-disciplinary team approach to address the complex clinical, social and cultural issues that impact the prevention control and elimination of tuberculosi s. Specialized care is given to children with tuberculosis, patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and those co-infected with HIV/AIDS. Demonstrated Effectiveness Since the Institute's creation, there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of tuberculosis cases within the population it serves. The Institute has an unprecedented record in patients' adherence in taking medica tion. Nearly all the patients--98 percent-- adhere to their medication regimen. 137 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES Many people in the population that the Institute serves are coping with a variety of life's challenges, and taking medicine is not a priority. To ensure that patients take their medications on time each day, the Institut e implemented a widely used strategy called directly observed therapy, or DOT. As its nam e indicates, as part of the support system, this therapy involves public health workers visiting tuberculosis patients to watch them take their medication. It is these dedicated professionals who have been instrumental in the Institute's unprecedented success. Providing Worldwide Education and Training The Institute's Education and Training staff uses its wealth of knowledge and experience to develop educational resources, training programs, and distance learning opportunities. Training courses and individualized programs on specific tuberculosis-related topics are presented to physicians, nurses, healthcare workers, and government leaders across the country and around the world. New, web-based educational programs are available for those who may not be able to travel, yet desire the latest tuberculosis information. The Institute's website houses an extensive collection of downloadable and adaptable resources at http://www.umdnj.edu/gtbiweb , and the staff provides technical assistance to a variety of providers to develop and integrate training into their own unique circumstances. Regional Training and Medical Consultation Services As a federally designated Regional Training and Medical Consultation Center, we are required to provide training, technical assistance and medical consultation to healthcare professionals throughout the Northeastern U.S. Our region includes Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia and the cities of Baltimore, Detroit, District of Columbia, New York City and Philadelphia. The Institute is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, with additional funds from U.S. Agency for International Development, NJ Department of Health and Senior Services and a number of non-governmental and private organizations and foundations. Medical Consultation Individualized information is provided by seni or medical staff to healthcare professionals and the public via a toll-free number, 1-800-4 TB DOCS (1-800-482-3627). This approach is well needed in the U.S. where rates of tuberculosis are declining along with the expertise and experience to deal with the disease and in high burden countries where resources may be less than adequate. When needed, the Institute provides supplementary advice to existing consultants for difficult cases of multi-drug resistant and pediatric tuberculosis, as well as for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS co-infection and others with complex medical management issues. Opening the Door to New Treatments and Practices The Institute is at the forefront of finding more effective ways to prevent and treat tuberculosis through groundbreaking research. As early as 1970, its staff was conducting clinical trials and doing studies in tuberculosis surveillance, patient behavior, and epidemiology. The Institute also collaborates closely with several of UMDNJ's 138 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 centers and departments, including the Center for Emerging Pathogens and the Public Health Research Institute. Currently, the Institute is participating in the study of new drug regimens that could shorten tuberculosis treatment. The Institute is a member of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuberculosis Trials Consortium and Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium. An International Connection The Institute participates in program revi ews and provides policy guidance and technical assistance on a variety of topics including tuberculosis at the primary healthcare level, co-infections of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and patient care in the private sector. Physicians and educators from the Institute have participated in training, presentations and symposia around the world, including the regions of Eastern Europe, Central and Eastern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America. The staff is also involved in international research. The Institute also offers individualized training programs in specific aspects of tuberculosis control for physicians, nurses, educators, government officials and others working in the field of tuberculosis. Specialized trainings can be tailored to meet the interests and needs of international participants. Training is geared towards participants from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis and aims to build the knowledge and skills of participants in these settings. The Institute has hosted trainees from more than 25 countries all over the world. Priority is given to healthcare providers from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis that are mobilized to respond to the problem. GREYSTONE PARK CLINICAL AFFILIATION (SHRP) The overall purpose of the Greystone Park affiliation is to enhance the quality of patient care services at this state psychiatric hospital by improving the competencies of direct care staff. To that end, five faculty members from the Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation provide a variety of programming and technical assistance initiatives that impact some 250 patients at Greystone Park annually. These initiatives include on-site undergraduate psychiatric rehabilitation course work, in-service training to improve staff group work skills, and specialized programs like the Program Readiness Mall for patients unable to use traditional hospital programs. HEALTH ENHANCEMENT AND LEARNING PROJECT (HELP) (SOM) The New Jersey Geriatric Education Center and the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging initiated a comprehensive health enhancement and learning program (HELP) through a grant from the New Jersey State Department of the Treasury and in collaboration with the Camden Area Health Education Center. The HELP program addresses chronic diseases/common geriatric syndromes, medications, and health management strategies for residents of selected senior citizen subsidized housing facilities in Camden. Built on the evidence-based Enhance Wellness Program and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, the project provided health assessments for residents, helped them identify health risk factors, and provided a behavioral health action plan. The project provided a nurse practitioner and community health worker to assist with cultural and health literacy issues and offered peer leadership training and support to assist the elderly participants in adhering to their identified health plan. The 139 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES goal of the program was to improve health an d prevent further disability in minority and underserved individuals with multiple chronic conditions, permitting them to age in place. The program also provided support and education to primary care physicians and health care professionals from multiple disciplines in the community, thus enhancing their knowledge of aging and appropriate assessment, intervention, and health promotion strategies, all directed at improving the quality of life and quality of care for aging New Jersey residents. HEALTH SCIENCE CAREERS PIPELINE (SHRP) The Health Science Careers Pipeline, formerly Tech Prep, began in the 1993-94 academic year with three high schools and 12 students. The program allows students early access to a career in the health scienc es and exposes them to health care settings where they learn patient care techniques. The program has a website www.healthcareers.umdnj.edu to educate students about various health careers. Approximately two-thirds of the students received college credit ranging from one to a maximum of 14 credits. These credits are ac cepted by every college in New Jersey and by a number of out-of-state colleges and unive rsities such as Georgetown University. HEALTHIER NEW BRUNSWICK 2010 INITIATIVE (RWJMS) Healthier New Brunswick 2010 is a longitudinal community-based, community-owned health improvement initiative managed by t he Community Health Advisory Group. In addition to the Medical School and several RWJMS institutes, the Advisory Group includes representatives from foundations, hospitals, community organizations, and development groups. Building on numerous previous health improvement efforts, the initiative is developing innovative strategies to address some of the persistent health problems affecting the residents of New Brunswick. In order to focus educational and preventive health care interventions, Healthier New Brunswick seeks to understand and incorporate a broad range of variables that influence children's health. Interventions are targeted to individuals, families, neighborhoods, the larger community and when appropriate, to the city as a whole. Partnerships with the New Brunswick Public Schools are particularly important in helping to achieve the project's goals. The four focus areas initially chosen for intervention are domestic violence, mental health/substance abuse, lead poisoning, and childhood obesity. HUNTERDON ENDOWED CHAIR IN COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY (RWJMS) With the support of the Hunterdon Health Fund, RWJMS will recruit a distinguished professor to serve as the new Endowed Chair in Community Health and Health Policy. With the appointment of the Chair, the Medical School plans to establish an Institute for Community Health and Health Policy for the improvement of the health status of vulnerable and underserved populations in the United States through innovations in patient care, medical education, and health policy. The Institute will bring together health policy and community health investigators, community-based faculty educators, and providers to develop research and educational projects that use a community-based participatory model to translate health policy and primary care research into practice. The new Institute will also provide opportunities for research collaboration with other schools within UMDNJ, and with Rutgers and Princeton Universities. 140 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE FAMILY SERVICE CENTER MONTHLY SUPPORT GROUP (SOM) This support group is offered by the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging on the third Tuesday of the month as part of the Huntington's Disease Family Service Center on the Stratford campus of SOM. It provides an opportunity for families and those with Huntington's disease to learn about the disease, cope with challenges, and access available resources. THE INSTITUTE FOR THE ELIMINATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES (SPH) The Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (IEHD) is a statewide initiative that engages and fosters research that will lead to a better understanding of the social-economic and cultural causes for the significant disparities that exist among various racial and ethnic groups, and seeks to identify strategies to address and eliminate them. Among its community interventions, the Institute is using Geographic Information Technology to identify the location of at-risk populations along with appropriate community resources that can be mobilized to reach these populations with health education and outreach. The Institute is also conducting research to examine racial differences in treatment offered to cancer patients in New Jersey, as well as examining social and cultural factors impacting adherence of African American wom en to adjuvant breast cancer treatment. IEHD has also provided pilot funding to UMDNJ faculty conducting health disparities research. In working with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Health Braintrust, IEHD hosted the conference: \"Bursting Out of Our Seams: Confronting the Challenge of Obesity in our Communities.\" The forum brought together more than 260 people including healthcare professionals, community leaders and members of the US House of Representatives' Congressional Black Caucus. In addition, the Institute continues to sponsor its health disparities seminar series in which nationally renowned speakers have shared findings and strategies pertaining to various health disparities. For more information on IEHD, contact Dr. Diane Brown at browndi@umdnj.edu . INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT INSTITUTE (SHRP) The Integrated Employment Institute is a program within the Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation at SHRP and is funded by the New Jersey Division of Mental Health Services. The mission of the Institute is to increase employment among people with psychiatric disabilities. To this end, the Institute seeks to influence individuals, organizations, and systems. The Institute works to increase the expectation of employment outcomes and to: Build the capacity of individuals to achieve or support employment goals. Develop organizational cultures, policies, and practices that promote employment outcomes. Remove systemic barriers and advocate for effective policies, practices and resources. 141 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES The Institute operates in eleven New Jersey counties. These include Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Salem. As a demonstration of best practice in the field, the Institute provides direct supported employment services to ten persons annually. These services include individualized career planning, competitive job development, placement, and follow-along support. The Institute provides service seminars to more than 100 persons with serious mental illness a year. These seminars are designed to build the capacity of the individual to direct his or her own career planning and acquisition. The Institute also helps mental health agencies promote employment services and employment outcomes for persons with serious mental illness through didactic and in-vivo training and on-going consultation. This includes training and technical assistance to outpatient departments, partial care programs, supported employment programs, supportive housing programs, assertive community treatment programs, and others throughout the region. Nearly 2,000 professionals a year receive training on more than 40 topics. Low-cost conferences and workshops are offered throughout the State where the participants can earn continuing education credit. The Institute convenes meetings of stakeholders and providers in various counties. Six of the Department's faculty members work full-time on this initiative. LEAD POISONED CHILDREN (NJMS) Lead poisoning from deteriorating paint that contains lead is a major hazard for urban children. Severe lead poisoning can lead to seizures and death while lower levels can impair performance in school and increase encounters with law enforcement authorities. The New Jersey Poison Information and Educat ion System (NJPIES) has established the New Jersey Lead Consortium, a monthly meeting where individuals from varied organizations such as DYFS, Medicaid and HMO's--as well as MDs, RNs, social workers and industrial hygienists--come together to discuss prevention/treatment of lead- poisoned children. At the monthly meeting, problem childhood lead-poisoning cases are reviewed, appropriate speakers are invited, and/or current journal articles are presented and discussed. LINKING THE CLASSROOM TO THE COMMUNITY (SPH) As an integral part of the MPH degree progr am goals and objectives, all MPH students at SPH connect with the real world environment in which public health practice and/or public health research is conducted. Fieldwork sites are selected by students with their faculty advisors among local, state and national agencies and organizations, governmental and voluntary health agencies, professional associations, hospitals and medical care services as well as internat ional locations. The fieldwork experience is based on the student's concentration in partnership with the agency. The following examples illustrate fieldwork projects completed during Academic Year 2006-2007 (project names and locations): Building the Capacity for Local Public Health Coalitions to Reach the Unmet Needs of Underrepresented Populations in New Jersey - HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean English-speaking Population in the Newark Eligible Metropolitan Area, 142 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 Newark EMA (Eligible Metropolitan Area) HIV Health Services Planning Council, Newark, NJ Implementation and Assessment of the PACNJ Asthma Action Plan, Pediatric/Adult Asthma Coalition of NJ, Union, NJ GED Performance Measurement Project, 1199 Training and Employment Funds, NY, NY Assessment of Substance Abuse Intervention and Treatment Retention in Juveniles: A Study of Adolescent Portable Therapy, Vera Institute of Justice, NY, NY Distribution of Brain Weights in Autistic Individuals, National Alliance for Autism Research, Princeton, NJ Addressing Community Health Needs at a Community-Based Organization: Challenges and Lessons Learned, Brooklyn Perinatal Network Inc., Brooklyn, NY New Jersey Cancer Prevalence Estimates by Major Cancer Site, Cancer Epidemiology Services, New Jersey Depar tment of Health and Senior Services, Trenton, NJ Prevalence of Complimentary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Breast and Prostate Cancer Patients, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ Perceptions of Contracting the HIV Virus, Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Practice & Primary Care, Washington, DC A Survey of Parents of Inner-city Children Presenting to the Emergency Room with Asthma, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Bronx, NY The Association Between CNS Medication and Motor Vehicle Accidents in the Elderly\" Center for the Study of Health Beliefs and Behaviors, New Brunswick, NJ Assessment of New Jersey Local Health Department Diabetes-related Services/Guidelines, NJ Department of Health and Senior Services, Trenton, NJ Major Determinants of Mortality in NJ: A Longitudinal Study, NJ Council of Teaching Hospitals, Trenton, NJ Healthy Camden City 2010 Update 2005\" Camden County Cancer Coalition, Camden, NJ Analysis of Camden City Focus Groups, Community Planning and Advocacy Council, Camden, NJ Escalating Cesarean Section Rates: A Health Policy Analysis, Rutgers-Center for State Health Policy, New Brunswick, NJ Assessing Cultural Dietary Beliefs and Practices Among Pregnant Latina Women Plainfield Health Center, Plainfield, NJ Association Between Public Knowledge of Prevention & Susceptibly Dental Disease and Unattained Objectives of Health People 2000, William Megill Dental Office, Rocky Hill, NJ Toxicological Assessment of Water Contaminants, Medarex, Pre-Clinical Development, Bloomsbury, NJ THE MARION P. THOMAS CHARTER SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP (SN) The UMDNJ-School of Nursing and Ramapo College joint nursing program has partnered with the Marion P. Thomas Charter School in Newark since 1999. The goal of the partnership is to develop and implement a health education curriculum for students, families and staff. At the beginning of the partnership in 1999, the school delivered a K-2 143 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES curriculum to 60 students. Each year the school adds a grade, so at present the school is a K-8 program enrolling 320 students. In partnership with the UMDNJ-School of Nursing, students enrolled in the Community Health nursing class under the tutelage of Frances Francabandera, Ed.D., R.N., have developed, implemented and evaluated a healthcare curriculum for students at all levels. This curriculum meets State standards and is individualized to include the specific needs for the groups of students, families and staff of the Charter School. For the last academic year, the content continued to focus on the areas of nutrition and sexuality in addition to the required content. The nursing students created course content dealing with healthy eating, healthy eating with \"fast food\", exercise and other topics dealing with nutrition. As the age range of the students has advanced, the topic of sexuality has become more important. Issues of importance for the staff have included stress management as well as healthy eating. All of this content is then shared with families through \"Health Notes,\" an in-home mailing for all students, staff and families. The nursing students also provided health screening for members of the Marion P. Thomas Charter School community. MAYOR'S WELLNESS CAMPAIGN (SN) The Mayor's Wellness Campaign (MWC) is a public-private partnership of civic, academic, and health-care policy advocates seeking to foster active living and healthy lifestyles with a long-term goal of reducing health care and other costs secondary to inactivity by providing communities with t he structure and resources to implement health community initiatives. The MWC Team is a partnership between the NJ Health Care Quality Institute, the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, with assistance from the NJ Department of Transportation and the joint nursing programs at Ramapo, and in association with the NJ State League of Municipalities. MWC Round One As part of the campaign, an MWC toolbox was distributed to all 566 of the State's municipalities at the NJ League of Municipalities' Conference in November 2005. The RN to BSN students of the joint nursing programs completed community assessments for nine Bergen and Passaic county municipalities, and these results were presented to the Mayors of the selected towns. Based on the results of these community assessments, the towns along with RNs from the joint nursing programs are identifying community specific interventions focusing on wellness. Results of these specific assessments were reported by the Mayors of Garfield and River Vale during the Conference on Municipalities. Round Two Community assessments are being completed for additional municipalities in Bergen and Passaic counties, and individual \"toolboxes\" will be created for involved towns. As a result, the Town of Garfield has initiated The Childhood Obesity Intervention Taskforce. This Taskforce is a collaboration between The joint nursing programs at Ramapo, Ramapo College, the Meadowlands Commission, the Town of Garfield, and the Community Health Education Program of William Paterson University. The RN to BSN students of the joint nursing programs at Ramapo, in collaboration with the school 144 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 nurses of the Garfield middle schools, have assessed the physical activity levels and BMIs of all middle school students in the Garfield School District. As an outcome, the Town of Garfield, through the Garfield Health Department and Town Council, applied for funding to address the identified childhood obesity issue. The original partners, including The Meadowlands Environmental Center, Ramapo College, and the joint nursing programs, were reconven ed and initiated a pilot program that will combine nutrition and physical activity education. The Ramapo and Meadowlands Survival Camp (RAMS) for Middle School Students was held on August 7-11, 2006. The program focused on \"survival skills\" from \"the Marsh-to-School-to-Home\". Twenty students and 20 faculty from community middle schools participated in the pilot, funded by the Leaders Academy for Health Community Development, Ramapo College, the Meadowlands Commission, and the Mayors' Wellness Project. Grant support will be sought following the pilot project to support the creation of curricula in schools and wellness projects for adults. M.D. WITH DISTINCTION IN SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY (RWJMS) UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has established the DISC program, providing students with the opportunity to earn the M.D. with Distinction in Service to the Community. Directed by the Office of Community Health, a select group of students plan, carry out and write up collaborative population health based scholarly projects under the guidance of faculty and community mentors. The program involves students over the full four years of medical school. It includes service and didactic components, journaling, the preparation of a thesis or publication, and a presentation of the completed project to the sponsoring community organization and the RWJMS community. The DISC program adds a rigorous, scholarly component to existing community service projects, generates experience in population health scholarship, responds to health needs as defined by the community, generates partnerships with community groups, and recognizes students who distinguish themselves by independent, strong, long-term commitments to community health programs. MEDICAL SCIENCE ACADEMY (SOM) The Medical Science Academy (formerly the High School Scholars Program) is a 28- week medical orientation program for twelfth-grade honor students from Camden, Burlington and Gloucester Counties in South Jersey. Students meet every Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM on the Stratford Campus. The Medical Science Academy offers integrated and thematically organized presentations by SOM faculty who volunteer their time to represent the medical and health care professions. Faculty address issu es such as responsibilities to themselves, their patients, their institutions and their communities, and provide current information relevant to their work. Students are able to participate in an optional research project sponsored by SOM in collaboration with UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions. Approximately 500 students have participated in the Medical Science Academy and have either completed training in a health-related profession or are attending undergraduate programs or medical schools. 145 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES MEDICAL STUDENT VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS (RWJMS) The Homeless and Indigent Population Health Outreach Project, (HIPHOP) was established by a group of RWJMS students in 1992 to help meet health needs of the greater New Brunswick community. HIPHOP links medical students with the community in an attempt to reduce barriers that prevent community members from accessing primary and preventive health care and education. Program objectives of HIPHOP are: To provide a variety of health outreach services to an underserved population. To provide medical, physician assistant, and public health students with meaningful service-learning experiences. To create a heightened awareness of the role that RWJMS should play within its community. To foster an atmosphere of responsible citizenship and encourage a lifelong commitment to community serv ice and humanism in medicine. To expand the program locally in such a way that it might be duplicated on a national level. The three major components of HIPHOP - the Clinic Project, the Homeless Project, and the Health Workshops Project - are designed to link specific learning objectives for students with the health-related needs of the community. The Clinic and Homeless Projects offer community members increased access to care by shadowing and assisting at St. John's Clinic and Trinity Health Center. These clinics are funded by Catholic Charities for the homeless and underserved of downtown New Brunswick and Perth Amboy. Working in teams of two fi rst-year medical students and one clinically experienced medical student, HIPHOP students take patient histories and perform physical examinations. They present their findings to a supervising physician, and together they develop and implement a plan of care. Several faculty members serve as preceptors. Students also work with Chandler's outreach workers to visit the homes of patients who have missed appointments or who need extra help. The teams provide information (for example, about immunizations, lead poisoning, nu trition and home safety), install safety devices (such as smoke detectors), and contact social service providers on behalf of their patients. The Health Workshops Project consists of two distinct educational programs: SHARRP (the Student Health Awareness and Risk Reduction Project) and STATS (Students Teaching AIDS To Students). Medical students in SHARRP develop mentoring relationships and provide health education through a series of interactive workshops with New Brunswick junior high school students to address issues of HIV prevention, sexual health and responsibility, self-esteem, environmental influences on health and behavior and substance abuse. In the STATS program, teams of medical students and physician assistant students visit high schools and other community sites to present one-time interactive workshops about HIV disease, sexual health and responsibility. In January 2005, a group of HIPHOP students started the HIPHOP Promise Clinic to provide increased access to health care for homeless people who receive their meals and social services at Elijah's Promise Soup Kitchen. Volunteer faculty physicians serve as preceptors for this weekly student-run clinic. 146 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 The Urban Health Initiative (UHI), RWJMS at Camden, provides a broad range of services to the Camden community and is critically important for RWJMS-Camden students. UHI is an organized opportunity for third and fourth year medical students to become involved in the Camden community in order to improve the overall quality of life of its citizens through service, charity, and education. Programs include an Adult Health Outreach Project (HOP) Clinic, a Pediatric HOP Clinic, a Women's HOP Clinic, and many school and community outreach programs. In August 2000, the AAMC-Pfizer Caring for Communities Project awarded funding to third and fourth year medical students from RWJMS-Camden to support the development of the first Adult HOP clinic. Thi s clinic provides free medical care to 110 uninsured adult residents of Camden in a medical student-run facility at the LEAP Academy Health Center. Twenty-nine clinical fa culty volunteer as preceptors in the HOP clinics. Students staff all aspects of the clinic, from the front desk to the pharmacy. All third-year RWJMS-Camden students participate in this elective experience, and each student follows from one to three patients for the year. A Pediatric HOP Clinic, begun in 2003, now serves about 80 patients whose families are uninsured residents of Camden. A Women's Health HOP clinic, begun in 2005, serves up to 60 patients. In addition to the free clinics, the UHI arranges for medical student volunteers to teach CPR and First Aid in schools, day care centers and churches throughout the city, as well as a comprehensive family health curriculum for students in grades K to 9 at the LEAP Academy. UHI also sponsors a Mentoring Program in which medical students provide small group and one-on-one teaching on a variety of health topics to middle school students at the Promise Charter School. A joint program between UHI and Cooper Hospital, the Health Science Academy was begun in 2006 as an opportunity for Camden high school students interested in health- related careers to gain first-hand exposure to the hospital environment and to receive advanced teaching in the health sciences. After an application process, high school students are selected to participate in this year-long program, which occurs every other Wednesday afternoon. These students head straight to the hospital after school for additional lessons on a range of health topics, such as diabetes, cardiology, bone/joint fractures, and substance abuse. RWJMS at Camden students are actively involved in presenting these lessons and mentoring the participants. On alternating sessions, the students are taken onto the hospital floors for tours of various clinical departments and talks about a variety of careers within the hospital setting. Rarely today are patients given an extended am ount of time to spend with their primary care provider to ask whatever health related concerns they have. Adopted as a UHI project in 2006, the Ask-the-Provider program gives local Camden residents just that opportunity. Once each month, the program provides an open forum for them to ask health providers any questions they have in an informal, intimate, and relaxed setting. In cooperation with Respond, Inc., a local day care organization, several medical students have connected Camden residents with the medi cal expertise of volunteer physicians. This year, the program has taken on new s hape, integrating a teaching segment for medical students to present a health-related topic to the evening's audience. Teaching topics this past academic year have included nutrition, infant feeding, asthma, children's health, and gynecological care. 147 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES MINI MED SCHOOL (NJMS) This program is designed to acquaint the community with the theory and practice of modern medicine, as well as to give them an understanding of the educational process involved in becoming a physician. Our public medical education programs are guided by a simple philosophical position: an educated patient is your doctor's best ally. By empowering the individual, the physician and other health care providers are better able to serve the person. The Mini Med School program provides an education that is meaningful and enjoyable for each of its participants. THE NATIONAL BORICUA LATINO HEALTH ORGANIZATION (SOM) The National Boricua Latino Health Organization (NBLHO) recently picked the student chapter at SOM as the winner of its \"Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias Chapter of the Year Award.\" This award is given annually to the chapter that best represents the ideals of NBLHO, which include recruiting Latinos into higher education, advocating for increased Latino representation in health-related areas and promoting awareness about social, political and economic issues involving Hispanic populations. During the past year, the SOM chapter sponsored a series of medical, cultural and social events for Hispanic Heritage Month, co-sponsored the Juvenile Diabetes Walk-a-thon, co-sponsored a Christmas party at a local nursing home and re-launched a mentoring program for high school students at LEAP Academy in Camden. SOM students are active in NBLHO leadership. The Co-Chair of the National Executive Board is SOM student Ms. Raquel S. Murphy. NBLHO is a proud member of the National Network of Latin American Medical Students. This is a national partnership between other regional Latino medical student groups to create one strong voice for Latino medical students throughout the entire United States. NATIONAL YOUTH LEADERSHIP FORUM ON MEDICINE (SOM) The National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine (NYLF) is designed to provide high school students from across the U.S. with exposure to the medical and health-related professions. Students from the NYLF visit the campus of SOM each summer during the months of June and July. During their visit, students are exposed to opportunities in osteopathic medicine and osteopathic manipulative medicine. The highlight of the visit is the Mini-Medical School that enables the students to interact with medical educators to learn about the admissions process, the rigorous academic expectations and other challenges that the road to medicine presents to aspiring physicians. SOM has sponsored visits by the NYLF since 1998. Each year approximately 265 high school students visit the campus. NEW BRUNSWICK COMMUNITY INTERPRETER PROJECT (RWJMS) The New Brunswick Community Interpreter Project (NBCIP), a grant-funded program based in the Office of Community Health, currently provides Spanish medical interpretation and translation services in three area health centers: The Eric B. Chandler Health Center, The High Risk Obstetrics Ambulatory Care Clinic at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey. The program's 148 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 goals are to make an impact on the quality of care received by Limited English Proficient patients in New Brunswick, and to give bilingual Rutgers students the opportunity to participate in a structured way in the local Hispanic community. Founded in 1999, the program has provided a student interpreter for more than 64,000 patient-provider encounters, and has translated over 100 vital medical documents into Spanish, including the recently published website for the Eric B. Chandler Health Center. The NBCIP has conducted basic interpreter training for bilingual staff at both the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the Woman's Ambulatory Care Clinic at St. Peter's University Hospital, as well as for bilingual medical students in t he RWJMS Department of Family Medicine. Additionally, the NBCIP has participated in the bilingual workshop given by the Department of Family Medicine for third-year medical students before they begin their clerkships. The program is staffed by two program coordinators and 35 student interpreters. NJ AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTERS (SOM) In collaboration with the NJ Area Health Education Centers (AHEC), the SOM Department of Family Medicine has expanded clinical experiences in underserved communities for students during their first and second year by designing Community Oriented Primary Care (COPC) projects. In addition, all third-year students participate in expanded Community Service rotations at NJ AHEC sites in Camden, Gloucester, Salem, Cumberland, and Atlantic counties. Host sites for these rotations include hospices, Head Start centers, federal prisons, migrant service organizations, adult daycare, local health departments, teen pregnancy prevention centers, and in-patient and out-patient substance abuse rehabilitation agencies. Each year over 16 COPC teams, each consisting of ten students, assess health needs and implement projects for helping underserved communities. With an emphasis on children and the elderly, projects this year included helping elementary school children with obesity; providing prenatal and well baby care for teenaged mothers; and helping seniors with Alzheimer's disease in the Camden Housing Authority program. NJ AHEC also facilitates many Kids into Health Careers programs, such as three Medical Explorer posts in Cumberland and Salem Counties; hospital job shadowing experiences in Gloucester County; Careers in Healthcare school fairs; and health careers curriculum to underserved middle school students in four Cumberland County schools. SOM students and faculty have participated in these activities that aim to increase the number of area minority and disadvantaged youth in the health professions. NEW JERSEY CENTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AT UMDNJ (SPH) The New Jersey Center for Public Health Preparedness at UMDNJ (NJCPHP), which is located at the UMDNJ-School of Public Health , is one of thirty-six Centers for Public Health Preparedness funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The New Jersey Center develops and provides education and training designed to ensure that public health, health care, emergency response, and other workers are prepared to more effectively respond to any biological, chemical, or nuclear threats or emergencies, as well as infectious disease outbreaks and natural disasters. Service accomplishments for NJCPHP in the 2006-2007 academic year include the distribution of the newsletter, New Jersey Prepared Together, and the online newsletter, 149 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES PHlash, to inform and to help coordinate preparedness education and training activities for the workforce of New Jersey. Several education and training activities were conducted specifically targeting nurses, practicing physicians, medical students, hospital emergency room staff, Port Authority security officers, and senior managers and their staffs in local, county and the state health department, among others. Two of the Center's faculty members were selected as Chair and Vice Chair of the State Health Department's Health Emergency Preparedness Advisory Council, and two members of the Center, representing the NJ Chapter of the American College of Physicians and the NJ Society for Public Health Education, are also members of this Council. Center members also participated in nation-wide groups of Centers working on pandemic influenza, chemical and radiological preparedness, state and local partnerships, vulnerable populations, and evaluation tools. THE NEW JERSEY GERIATRIC EDUCATION CENTER (SOM) Federally funded by the Bureau of Health Professions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/Health Resources and Services Administration (DHHS-HRSA), the New Jersey Geriatric Education Center (NJGEC) provides training in geriatrics and gerontology to health care professionals of multiple disciplines statewide, with a focus on minority and underserved communities. Administered through the SOM-New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging, the NJGEC has trained over 17,000 health care professionals of multiple disciplines since its inception in 1990. With the elimination of federal funding for geriatrics in FY 2006, the NJGEC continued its interdisciplinary training efforts beyond its first year of a new 5-year funding cycle. SOM supported NJGEC efforts on a limited basis through \"bridging funds.\" In February of 2007, full funding for geriatrics was restored for HRSA geriatric programs. The NJGEC has applied for federal funding for the 2007-2010 period and is pending grant review. NEW JERSEY POISON INFORMATION AND EDUCATION SYSTEM (NJMS) New Jersey's first poison center was established in the late 1950s. By 1975 there were 32 \"Poison Control Centers\" located in acute care hospitals throughout the state. In 1978, in response to a federal initiative to develop regional emergency medical services, New Jersey developed a task force to look into how to provide poison center services. In response to this initiative, the state legi slature passed enabling legislation calling upon the New Jersey Department of Health to develop a drug and poison information program for the state. In February 1983, as the result of this legislation and in a cooperative effort between the New Jersey Hospital Association and the New Jersey Department of Health the regional poison control system, New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), was born. NJPIES is a member of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) and is designated as a regional Poison Control Center under AAPCC guidelines. Additionally, NJPIES manages the Department of Health and Senior Services AIDS/STD hotline. The Center also serves as an information source for the NJDHSS in cases of product tampering or product recall and in food-borne illness incidents, performing a 150 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 valuable public service in time of crisis. NJPIES provides 24 hour, 7 days a week emergency service statewide for poison exposures, general poison and drug information. Specialists in Poison Information, who are physicians, registered nurses or pharmacists, handle all calls. Many of the specialists are fluent in Spanish and several are fluent in additional languages. NJPIES also has a contract with a telephone interpretation service, which allows immediate access to hundreds of languages and dialects. We offer TDD/TTY service for the hearing impaired. Specialist s answer questions about adverse effects of medications, possible risks for drug interaction or the potential effects of medicines on pregnancy or breast feeding. Specialists also answer questions prior to exposure to or use of a potentially poisonous or hazardous product, such as household chemicals, plants, cosmetics or environmental contamin ants like lead. They help the callers to assess the possibility for harm or damage and give recommendations for minimizing or eliminating risk. The Poison Control Center is funded through a contract with the state of New Jersey, Federal and other grants, and from private donations. NURSE MIDWIFERY SERVICE (SN) The School of Nursing offers nurse-midwifery services at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBIMC); St. Mary's Hospital in Passaic; and Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC). Services include prenatal care, in hospital labor management, and post partum/newborn care. At NBIMC there were a total of 800 prenatal visits and 704 births by the midwife. At St. Mary's Hospital there were 1,335 prenatal visits and 121 births by the midwife. The program at JCMC began mid-2006 with part time coverage of women during the labor process. NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV / AIDS (SHRP) This initiative, funded by Ryan White Titl e I, embodies UMDNJ's four missions: education, research, patient care and community service. For six years, SHRP's M.S. in Clinical Nutrition faculty has been providing nutrition services to individuals with HIV/AIDS in the Infectious Disease Practice at University Hospital and other Newark agencies. The nutrition status of individuals in the Infectious Disease Practice unit has been tracked and the positive impact of nutrition intervention documented on an annual basis. This program started in 1998 with Ryan White Title III funds (which initially supported a half-time Registered Dietitian) and gradually increased with Ryan White Title I monies to one full-time R.D. in 1999, the equivalent of 1.5 R.D.'s in 2000, and then to two R.D.'s in 2002. The program fulfills a critical need in Newark, a city with one of the largest HIV/AIDS populations in the U.S. Nutrition education services, food and clothing drives, and education of staff and patients have helped to provide a valuable service to the New Jersey community. OEO SUMMER EXPLORATION PROGRAM (SOM) The Summer Exploration Program is a six- week summer youth employment program that provides employment for high school students in the careers of their choice. The objective of the program is to train and mentor student interns to develop positive employee characteristics and skills while a llowing them to receive experience in a 151 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES vocational field of their choice. Each summer four high school students are selected to work in the Department of Academic and Student Affairs assisting with various projects. OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE (SPH) Centers for Education and Training The Centers for Education and Training (CET) provides training to over 3,000 men and women at its training facility annually, offering 250 continuing education short courses.

The goals of the program are: To provide high school students with public health career information. To provide teachers with resources to teach public health in high schools. To provide high school students with information on public health and how it impacts them every day. The OPHP has worked with the SPH Volunteer Opportunities In Community-Engaged Service (V.O.I.C.E.S.) organization to conduct the outreach program. PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICINE COURSE (RWJMS) RWJMS launched a new course in 2006, Patient-Centered Medicine , to provide students with more opportunities early in their education to learn in clinical settings, to integrate basic science and clinical information, to address ethical issues, to teach communication skills, to enhance cultural competency, and to strengthen community service links. All students participate in service learning activities. Patient-Centered Medicine fosters the value of community involvement and enhances opportunities for students to engage in community health programs. PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (SHRP) The Department of Developmental and Rehabilit ative Sciences offers full physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluation services to public school children in Newark, and partial services in Paterson. These services are part of the faculty practice plan of the Department but also include opportunities for physical therapy students to 153 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES participate as part of the Department's community service expectations. The service is provided to students at all levels of primary and secondary education in the school system. This service is the largest of its kind in the country offered wholly by a physical therapy program. PRE-COLLEGE PROGRAM (SHRP) The College Bound program offered jointly with New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University-Newark serves approximately 500 students in grades 7-12 from Newark, Irvington and East Orange. The program provides academic support through the academic year and offers a six-week full-time program in the summer. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH (NJMS) Since September 11, 2001, the Department forged collaboration with the Newark City Health Department. Initially, sessions cons isted of case scenarios for preparedness for Bioterrorism. Subsequently, this led to an expanded work group consisting of a coalition of the New Jersey Medical School, the Newark City Health Department, the Emergency Medical System, and local hospitals to establish a surveillance system and a field for capacity for investigations. PROJECT H.O.P.E. (SOM) H. Timothy Dombrowski, D.O., chair of the Department of Internal Medicine, provides primary care to the homeless of Camden one afternoon per month in collaboration with Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center and the Volunteers of America Men's Shelter and Helen Smith House/Leavenhouse. This clinic is one aspect of the larger program that provides medical, social, outreach, and advocacy services to Camden City's homeless via a mobile outreach unit. The outreach unit provides health screenings, counseling, and case management; two weekly satellite primary care clinics that provide physicals, non-emergency care, and case management; and a weekly evening clinic at the Bergen Lanning Health Center for extended follow-up. Christopher Myers, M.S.N., A.P., the nurse practitioner from St. Luke's, volunteers eight hours per month at the Bergen Lanning Health Center. Among an estimated Camden homeless populati on of 3,500 to 6,500, 1,340 are Project H.O.P.E. users. Project H.O.P.E. is also a training site for the SOM Department of Medicine's federally funded Primary Care Internal Medicine Residency Program and its Inner City Medicine rotation. RESPIRATORY CARE (SHRP) The respiratory care faculty have launched the Asthma Education Program for Inner-City Children. This program provides school-aged children and their parents/guardians with educational information about the causes, management and treatment of asthma. Thus far, several parochial and public schools in northern New Jersey are participating in the program, and still others have expressed interest. 154 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 RWJMS OFFICE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS (RWJMS) The RWJMS Office of Multicultural Affairs/Office of Special Academic Programs sponsors programs to address health disparities or focus on culturally competent health care as a way of eliminating health disparities. Its goal is to educate the medical school community regarding cultural issues affecting quality health care as well as to foster diversity through recruitment and retention of students underrepresented in medicine. The Office develops, organizes, and sponsors educational, cultural and summer program activities that focus on increasing awareness and sensitivity so that students, staff, and faculty gain a better appreciation and respect for the differences that exist in our society. THE SOM CHAPTER OF THE STUDENT NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (SOM) The Student National Medical Association (SNMA) chapter at SOM was named the Northeast region's \"Chapter of the Year\" by SNMA 's national board at the 2007 Annual meeting. Established in 1964, SNMA is the nation's oldest and largest medical student organization dedicated to ensuring culturally sensitive medical education and services, as well as increasing the number of African-American, Latino and other students of color entering and completing medical school. Selected from among the 18 SNMA chapters in the region, the members of UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine's chapter were noted for their tireless work to promote the SNMA mission of cultural competence and service to the medically underserved. Among the many events sponsored by the local SNMA chapter were a series of community lectures on topics related to health disparities, free health screenings at several events, a school supplies drive for Operation Backpack, a bone marrow donor registration drive and a fashion show and fundraiser to benefit local charities. SOM COMMITMENT TO OUR HOST COMMUNITY, THE BOROUGH OF STRATFORD (SOM) Under the leadership of SOM Interim Dean Thomas A. Cavalieri, D.O., there is a strong school-wide commitment to being a good neighbor with Stratford. Stratford is a 1.6 square mile borough comprised of 7,271 residents, 2,736 households and 1,906 families in Camden County. SOM and its student organizations provide a wide array of health-related services to Stratford schools and community organizations, including blood pressure screenings, diabetes testing, flu immunization programs and regular education programs that are well attended by the community. SOM's leadership of the Steering Committee that formed the Stratford Business and Civic Association in 2004 has demonstrated support for the borough's business community. SOM's Director of Strategic Planning and Program Development served as the organization's first President in 2005. 155 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES SPECIAL OLYMPICS - SPECIAL SMILES NJ (NJDS AND SHRP) The mission of the Special Olympics-Special Smiles program is to increase access to dental care for Special Olympics athletes, as well as all people with intellectual disabilities. Dental screenings, oral hygiene instruction, nutrition education, blood pressure screening and the fabrication of sports mouth guards are part of a collaborative effort by NJDS and SHRP to focus attention on the dental health issues facing New Jersey's Special Olympics athletes. The two UMDNJ Schools sponsor a health and wellness center for the Health Athletes Initiative of New Jersey Special Olympics, providing education and community service to New Jersey residents who join in Special Olympics activities. For the 11th year, data collected at the NJ Special Olympics Summer Games will help to generate a snapshot of the oral health of a representative sample of the hundreds of thousands of Special Olympics athletes around the world. These data are used to encourage increased education and funding. Oral and nutrition research projects identifying oral and nutrition health status of these athletes have been presented and published on the international level, and have been used to support the need for extended services to this population. SPH / CROATIA PARTNERSHIP (SPH) A Cooperative Agreement between the U.S. Agency for International Development and American International Health Alliance, Inc., enabled the formation of a partnership between the UMDNJ-School of Public Health in Piscataway, New Jersey and city of Split, Croatia, Healthy Cities Program, in November of 2001. Members of the SPH team from the Department of Health Systems and Policy and the Department of Health Education and Behavioral Science conducted in-person meetings for five years and now continue the collaboration long-distance. Faculty members provide technical assistance with the planning and implementation of a public health intervention focusing on the prevention of adolescent alcohol use. Faculty members have provided training in the Project Northland curriculum\u2014a school-based, three-year adolescent alcohol prevention intervention being implemented in 13 schools in the city of Split. In addition to SPH faculty, the Partnership team consists of the director of the city of Split Social and Non-Governmental Organizational Programs, the director of Domestic Violence Services, and the chief of the Department of Addictions. For more information contact Dr. Bernadette West at westbm@umdnj.edu . ST. LUKE'S CATHOLIC MEDICAL SERVICES (SOM) Lesley A. D'Ambola, D.O., of the General Internal Medicine Division, provides the medical directorship and clinical care at St. Luke's Catholic Medical Services in Camden, NJ. Christopher Myers, M.S.N., A.P., a nurse practitioner, joined Dr. D'Ambola in the practice in May 2004. St. Luke's is a primary care medical practice for the poor, uninsured and underinsured community of the City of Camden. St. Luke's was founded in 1983 as a joint venture of the Diocese of Camden and the Jesuit Urban Service Team (J.U.S.T.). Since it is one of the few medical practices with a fluent bilingual staff, it attracts a predominately Latino clientele. St. Luke's se rves a population that is 60% Latino, 30% African-American, and 10% White. Thirty percent of its patients have no health 156 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 insurance. Its professional staff includes a physician, a nurse, a nurse practitioner, three nursing assistants, and administrative staff. The addition of the nurse practitioner to the staff has enabled St. Luke's to add a home visit component to its service delivery model. In addition to primary care, St. Luke's staff provides individualized health education programs and preventive health care, with a focus on cancer screening and immunizations. In 2005, there were over 5,500 patient visits at St. Luke's, with Type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and anemia the most common diagnoses. St. Luke's is a training site for the medical school. It provides SOM's medical students, internal medicine residents, and geriatric fellows with a unique opportunity to learn about the practice of community-based, urban medicine. St. Luke's also offers a training experience designed to cultivate an appreciation of cultural diversity and to provide the knowledge and skills needed for culturally competent medical care. In addition, St. Luke's serves as the keystone training site for a Primary Care Internal Medicine Residency Program funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/Health Resources and Services Administration to train general internists to provide primary care to medically underserved populations. A related program is Dayton Manor, an assisted living facility in Camden. It formerly served as a retirement home that prov ided meals, laundry, and basic housekeeping services to its residents, many of whom came from State institutions for the mentally ill, boarding homes, or other residences. The population was medically complex with many physical and mental challenges. Many of these residents remained when the facility converted to assisted living in 2004. Like St. Luke's Catholic Medical Services, Dayton Manor is a training site for the SOM Department of Medicine's federally funded primary care internal medicine residency program. Along with St. Luke's and Project H.O.P.E., Dayton Manor is also a training site for SOM fourth-year medical students. Dr. D'Ambola of the General Internal Medicine Division serves as Medical Director and provides clinical services along with Mr. Myers, a nurse practitioner. STANDARDIZED PATIENT LABS (SOM) SOM is a pioneer in developing Standardized Patient Labs that assess medical students caring for patient \"actors\", thereby providing evaluation not only of diagnostic skills but of cultural competency as well. The full survey of SOM by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation in September 2006 included a commendation for the school's inclusion of cultural competency in the Standardized Patient Lab. In recognition of SOM's leadership, former Acting Governor Richard Codey came to the school's Stratford campus on March 23, 2005 to tour the Standardized Patient Labs and sign legislation requiring cultural competency education as a requirement for medical licensure in the State. STATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR TRAINING IN GERIATRICS AND GERONTOLOGY (SOM) The SOM New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging and the New Jersey Geriatric Education Center (NJGEC) continue to work collaboratively with other institutions and organizations to provide training on a variety of aging-related topics. During 2006, the 157 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging (NJISA) and the NJGEC participated in program planning and delivering content for University Behavioral HealthCare-Technical Assistance Center. A series of three forums were conducted with members from state agencies, community-based organizations, the aging services network, long term care providers, and mental health screeners. The content focused on mental health and state screening laws, pre-admission screening for Medicaid nursing home placement, and development of assessment and interventi on algorithms for managing behavioral health problems. This is part of a larger state-supported initiative in \"transformational change\" in the mental health system. The Blueprint on Aging for the State of New Jersey is currently under development through the NJ Department of Health and Senior Services and the NJ Commission on Aging Subcommittee on Health Promotion. The NJISA co-chairs the subcommittee and provided content, images and critique for the report. NJISA provided consultation services for planning and development for Meridian Health System in Brick, New Jersey in the late summer and fall of 2006, to assist with development of an academic geriatrics program and initiation of an Acute Care of the Elderly Unit. The NJISA is working closely with the UMDNJ-School of Nursing and the UMDNJ-School of Public Health to increase training opportunities in aging for students and health care professionals. NJISA continues to offer clinical practicum experiences for nursing, social work and psychology, and nutrition students from UMDNJ sister schools, Drexel University, Rutgers School of Social Work, the College of New Jersey, and Stockton State College. NJISA also provides clinical rotations across the geriatric care continuum for medical students from Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine and Kansas City School of Osteopathic Medicine. NJISA and the UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions have collaborated on a proposal to the UMDNJ Foundation to support a research focus on weight loss and chronic disease self-management. If approved, this one-year project will begin in July 2007 and will use nutrition evaluation and intervention strategies within the ambulatory practice of the NJISA. NJISA is offering an all-day Symposium on Geriatric Oncology on Friday, October 19, 2007, in collaboration with the Cancer Institute at Cooper Medical Center. Physicians from NJISA and Cooper will be featured speakers. STATEWIDE NETWORK FOR COMMUNITY ORAL HEALTH EXTRAMURAL DENTAL CENTERS (NJDS) The New Jersey Dental School has shown its commitment to Newark and the State of New Jersey with the creation of the Statewide Network for Community Oral Health. A needs assessment was performed which revealed that access to dental care was a problem for historically underserved populations; i.e., the low income, the indigent elderly, migrant workers and their families, those physically and mentally challenged, and HIV/AIDS patients. The purpose of the Statewide Network for Community Oral 158 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 Health is to carry out the educational and service missions of the University and the Dental School. The Statewide Network provides dental services to communities throughout the State of New Jersey with dental centers in Atlantic, Camden, and Somerset Counties. The Statewide Network had over 100,000 patient visits this past year. The dental centers in the Statewide Network serve as a venue for increasing the number of oral health care providers in underserved communities in New Jersey; increasing access to quality oral health care; and expanding the educational component of training oral health care providers. STATEWIDE TEEN HEALTH SEMINAR (SOM) The Stratford campus of SOM hosted for the fourth year a special Health Teen Seminar for over 150 high school seniors from over 70 high schools across the State. Sponsored by the Medical Society of New Jersey Allianc e, the April program provides information on substance abuse, nutrition, conflict resolution and other health care issues. SOM faculty serve as presenters on sports medicine (steroids), date rape and other topics requested by the students. STUDENT HEALTH ADVOCATES FOR RESOURCES & EDUCATION CENTER (NJMS) In 1996, students at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School created the Student Health Advocates for Resources and Education (SHARE) Center, an organization dedicated to encouraging and mobilizing all medical student s to become more involved with the Newark community. SHARE has three objectives: To establish and maintain community partnerships in order to improve the quality of our outreach programs through ongoing community needs assessment.

To maintain the sustainable infrastructure that assumes responsibility for coordinating student projects and centralizes operations of existing community service programs at NJMS. Students Teaching AIDS to Students (STATS) STATS is an outreach program in which first- and second-year medical students lead sexual health workshops for Newark's middle and high school students. The workshops focus on disease prevention through education and empowerment of teens to make healthy choices. Student Family Health Care Center (SFHCC) The SFHCC provides free, quality medical care to the Newark community. Under NJMS faculty, teams of medical students treat individuals of all ages who often have no insurance coverage. Throughout their four years of medical school, SFHCC is an opportunity for students to enhance their clinical skills and \"bedside manner. \" Community 2000 (C2000) C2000 is an outreach organization that serves the Newark community through health promotion and disease prevention. This organization assesses co mmunity health needs at local health fairs and addresses these needs through interactive adult workshops. C2000 also holds after-school workshops for Newark's youth to promote healthy 159 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES lifestyles. Participation in C2000 allows medical students to gain valuable skills in clinical medicine and patient education. C2000 organizes health fairs at community sites once a month. Patients are provided free screenings for hypertension, diabetes, vision and body mass index by teams of medical students. Patients discuss their screening results with a medical student and attending physician and can request additional material on other health topics. If necessary, health fair patients are referred to the SFHCC clinic for follow-up appointments. New Moms Program In 2002, SHARE Center launched its latest initiative to impact the care of young mothers within the city of Newark. This program is designed to increase awareness about women's health among medical students as well as future mothers, and to encourage a healthy lifestyle during and after pregnancy. As a community-based health care organization, medical students will enter the Newark community and effectively communicate with pregnant women about pressing maternal and prenatal health issues, identify at-risk mothers, and provide interventional support to increase the health and well-being of mothers and children in the city. Early Start Mentoring Program This is a community outreach project that places trained mentors into Newark elementary schools to promote positive social behavior and non-aggressive conflict resolution. The focus of the program is to develop self-esteem and social problem-solving skills, while offering a cari ng and supportive outlet for students. Unite For Sight This is an organization dedicated to eliminating preventable blindness through screening and education and to developing sustainable solutions to reduce health disparities. The NJMS chapter of Unite for Sight is involved in the following activities: Preliminary vision screenings for children and adults in soup kitchens, homeless shelters, schools and at C2000 health fairs. Enrollment in insurance and free health coverage programs (Children's Health Insurance Program, Academy of Ophthalmology's National Eye Care Projects, Academy of Optometry's VisionUSA, Sight For Students, Medicare, Medicaid, VA Insurance). Vision education program presentations teaching students and adults about eye anatomy and eye disease by examining the history of ophthalmology through unique perspectives, such as the comparison of ancient and modern ophthalmologic procedures, art history seminars addressing eye disease in eminent artists and discussing of the social history of eyeglasses. Program in Advocating Community Leader Empowerment (PINACLE) The goal of PINACLE is to establish a collaborative partnership between NJMS students and the permanent residents of the Newark community. Specifically, PINACLE seeks to develop a comprehensive primary health prevention program within the SHARE Center. The goals and objectives are as follows: To facilitate community access to NJMS services including those targeting the uninsured. 160 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 To streamline efforts to avoid duplication of service by fostering collaboration between medical students, other health related students, and faculty.

To better coordinate the service program s provided by University Hospital and other UMDNJ schools on the Newark campus. To improve the ability to identify and address which community health needs are being met and which are not. SUMMER MEDICAL AND DENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAM (NJMS) The Summer Medial and Dental Education Pr ogram (SMDEP) serves to advance the institution's core mission to meet society's current and future healthcare needs by preparing individuals underrepresented in medicine and dentistry while championing cultural competency and humanism in all aspects of education. SMDEP reaffirms continued involvement in pipeline initiatives that will foster even greater diversity. SMDEP provides the opportunity to strengthen the academic portfolios of individuals underrepresented so that they are competitive candidates for medicine and dentistry. Specifically, the goal is to increase the diversity in medicine and dentistry recognizing that disparities in healthcare do exist. To accomplish this goal, SMDEP has implemented a myriad of programs in collaboration with partners at the pre-college, undergraduate, professional school, and community levels. Collectively, these partnerships continue to embrace and recognize the impact that diversity has on the educational experience of all students and on the delivery of culturally competent quality healthcare. THE TOBACCO DEPENDENCE PROGRAM (SPH) The Tobacco Dependence Program at the UMDNJ-School of Public Health is part of a broad range of services developed by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services to reduce illness and death from tobacco. The program comprises a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise in the treatment of tobacco dependence and in training other health professionals to do so effectively. More details on the work of the program can be found at http://www.tobaccoprogram.org . The Tobacco Dependence Clinic The Tobacco Dependence Clinic opened its doors in January 2001 to provide specialist assessment and treatment for people who want help with a problem relating to tobacco dependence. By June 2007, the Clinic has seen over 3,000 patients, approximately 30% of whom remain abstinent six months following their original quit date. The clinic opened a second site in Newark in January 2007 and also serves as a tertiary referral and consultancy center for health professionals throughout New Jersey who may need assistance. For more information visit: www.tobaccoclinic.org . 161 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES Tobacco Training and Consultancy for Health Professionals The Tobacco Dependence Program offers specific consultation and training services for treatment and service providers throughout New Jersey, with particular focus in the areas of addictions, mental health and young people. These are three special populations with a high prevalence of smoking but limited access to treatment. Recent examples of work include: Training of staff members at 40 New Jersey high schools to implement the \"Youth Quit2Win\" smoking cessation program. Training of staff members at over 20 New Jersey addiction treatment centers to treat tobacco dependence in their clients. Training (in collaboration with the D epartment of Psychiatry at the UMDNJ- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) of staff members at six New Jersey psychiatric facilities to implement a smoking intervention with their patients. Training of over 500 Tobacco Dependence Treatment Specialists through a five- day intensive program. Tobacco Control in the Community The Tobacco Dependence Program (TDP) also has two grants aimed at community level interventions on tobacco control. \"Proyecto Vida: Latino Deja de Fumar\" aims to stimulate smoking cessation in New Jersey's Latino community, ( www.proyectovidanofume.org ) and the TDP also organizes the Middlesex Partnership Against Tobacco. Research The TDP is active in tobacco research and has published over 70 papers in peer-reviewed journals over the past seven year s, including many authored by MPH students on work conducted with community agencies for fieldwork placements. TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE AND EVALUATION RESEARCH PROGRAM (SPH) The Tobacco Surveillance and Evaluation Research Program (TSERP) was established in 2000 to evaluate New Jersey's Comprehensive Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) and is responsible for monitoring tobacco use trends in response to the State's tobacco control activities. TSERP also conducts research using statewide and nationally representative datasets to advance the field of tobacco control. A key priority of TSERP is the dissemination of its findings. Since 2000, TSERP has produced 14 reports for NJ CTCP, delivered over 70 conference presentations, and published over 30 journal articles. The program is currently in the process of establishing itself as a Center for Tobacco Surveillance & Evaluation Research. For more information on this project, contact Dr. Cristine Delnevo at delnevo@umdnj.edu . TRINKETS AND TRASH: ARTIFACTS OF THE TOBACCO EPIDEMIC (SPH) This program monitors and collects current and historic examples of tobacco products, promotional items, tobacco marketing materials and advertising. It is intended to serve as a source for scholarly research; provid e a historic record of tobacco industry products, marketing and promotion; and serve as a tool for advocacy and educating the general public. The website http://www.trinketsandtrash.org features downloadable 162 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 images of the newest products and promotions, along with images of older, more familiar items and some rare antiques.

Examples of the collection are on display at the SPH in Piscataway. For more information on this project contact Dr. Jane Lewis at lewismj@umdnj.edu . UMDNJ-RWJMS DEPARTMENTAL ACTIVITIES (RWJMS) Community service is at the core of many of the research and clinical activities of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine and the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI). The World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program provides outreach, diagnosis, support, and state-of-the-art-treatment to the virtual community of New Jersey responders who are still suffering after their work at this disaster site. On a smaller scale, much of the clinical work performed at the Clinical Center of EOHSI interfaces with neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces affected by exposures to toxic or hazardous pollutants, including some communities that receive ongoing medical surveillance for their prior exposures. In addition, research occurs in venues such as the New Jersey Turnpike and union halls across the region, as the Department and the EOHSI strive to understand the health hazards that affect our communities and workplaces. In conjunction with medical student training, faculty volunteer at The Promise Clinic in New Brunswick to perform medical examinations for urban minorities. Faculty have developed a Healthy Homes Demonstration Project with Isles, Inc, of Trenton. Building on the previously successful efforts of Dust Does Not Discriminate, Healthy Homes Mold Project and Arrest the Pests in Your Nest , faculty developed a VHS and an English and Spanish language DVD training module on mold and other environmental contaminants in the home. Entitled \"the Healthy Homes Video,\" the target audience is urban minority residents. Another ongoing Department project is the work being done in the Camden community through many churches and communi ty groups, including Heart of Camden, to address the methods of reducing community exposure and risk to toxins in the South Camden area. The Department is also developing a pilot community assessment course for Trenton community members to learn how to re cognize, assess, evaluate and remediate community hazards. In addition, a Community Based Sampling course is being developed for students in the graduate programs in Public Health, Toxicology, and Environmental Science to learn how to assess, sample and analyze an urban site and to deliver the information to the community. The Department of Family Medicine involves students in community-based activities beginning in the first year of medical school and throughout the residency program in family medicine. The goals of the Department's community-based initiatives are: To instill an ethic of community service and social responsibility in medical students/residents by training them in the context of community service. To foster partnerships between community organizations and the Medical School to promote the health of underserved/vulnerable populations. 163 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES To equip the next generation of health professionals with the community oriented/ culturally sensitive competenc ies needed to make a difference in the lives of their patients/clients and the communities they serve. The Department has developed a number of comm unity-based initiatives to help meet these goals. In Medical School, during the first-year Introduction to the Patient course, medical students are assigned to one of over twenty community-based organizations that host the students twice a month for a year. Students are exposed to services provided by the organization and are given the opportunity to interact with patients/clients to learn more about cultural, community, and familial factors influencing health. During the third-year family medicine clerkship, medical students participate in community-based service learning that has been incorporated into the curriculum. These activities are complemented by didactic sessions on communi ty-oriented primary care and principles of population-based health care. In addition, students may elect to participate in an eight-week Community-Oriented Primary Care (COPC) Assistantship between the first and second year of medical school. Students in COPC, who must complete independent projects, are assigned to a community-based health care or social service organization and attend weekly seminars covering topics aimed at increasing student awareness about the principles and practice of COPC, health disparities, population assessments, and culturally competent clinical care. Students also participate in a tour of local botanicas and bodegas. The New Brunswick RWJMS Family Medicine Residents provide quality primary care services to many of greater New Brunswick's uninsured and underinsured citizens, many of whom are not documented. Patients are seen in the Family Medicine Service and at clinics within RWJ-UH, Family Medicine at Monument Square, St. John's Clinic, soup kitchens and homeless shelters, senior citizen apartments, long-term care facilities and in patients' own homes. Additionally, the New Brunswick RWJMS Fam ily Medicine Residents provide primary care services to the greater New Brunswick community. As part of their training, all second-year residents participate in a cross-cultural community medicine rotation at St. John's Health Center in New Brunswick. The goal of the rotation is to encourage residents to practice in medically underse rved urban areas by offering a rewarding learning experience that enhances their skills in providing culturally sensitive, community-oriented primary care to a diverse and indigent population. Residents learn about different multicultural populations and became familiar with managing clinical issues prevalent in the community (e.g. lead poisoning, immunizations, TB exposure, HIV, substance use, health problems ex acerbated by poverty and homelessness). They participate in community-based health care activities including seeing patients at a child health conference, a pap/mammogram screening, and volunteering at a local soup kitchen. Community site visits included the Middlesex County Board of Social Services, a homeless shelter, a botanica and bodega, and accompanying St. John's prenatal and immunization outreach workers on home visits. In addition, residents conduct community presentations at the Edison Job Corps Academy, Ozanam Men's Homeless Shelter, and Naomi's Way--a transitional housing facility for women and their children. Presentation topics included: personal hygiene, nutrition, and respiratory illnesses. Residents also participate in community-based activities such as school physicals, health fairs, 164 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 pap/mammogram screenings, prostate cancer screenings, and community presentations, as part of their longitudinal community medicine experience.

This grant-funded project uses an interdisciplinary collaborative approach and an outcomes oriented focus for a nurse-faculty managed, university-based mobile healthcare project, in collaboration with UMDNJ-University Hospital. The project uses faculty-supervised student nurses and an interdisciplinary mobile health team staff, in association with the clinical affiliates of UMDNJ, community- based organizations (CBOs) and faith-based healthcare initiatives. Situated within the UMDNJ-School of Nursing, this initiative uniquely creates public- private partnerships in the mutual goal of improving access to care for urban at-risk populations. The broad objectives of the project are: 1) to screen, identify and provide health promotion/disease management services for at-risk populations; 2) to foster community involvement in the health assessment and referral process; and 3) to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive health promotion/disease management health education. The project staff provides primary care and screening services using a mobile healthcare facility on wheels designed to reduce the traditional barriers to health care access. A $250,000 grant from the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey, with matching funds from the UMDNJ-School of Nursing, covered the cost of start-up operations in April 2006. An HRSA grant for $1.7 million over five years was awarded to the project at the start of' fiscal year 2008. In partnership with the Children's Health Fund, the project has joined with a national network of mobile healthcare programs to leverage support for addressing the healthcare needs of the underserved. Following a year of planning and in anticipation of the arrival of the mobile van, the project initiated the delivery of primary care services in early March 2007 at five clinical sites in the greater Newark area. Preliminary data findings indicate a current caseload of 173 patients, with encounters ranging from 5 to 14 visits daily. The projec t serves a predominantly minority population of 81% Black, 19% Hispanic, and 2% White. The male to female ratio is 1:1. While the project services patients in all age groups, the largest percentage of patients are those in the 0-5 age category (70%). To date, the majority of visits (36%) are made to perform physical examinations for health clearance to permit attendance at elementary and pre- school. Dental screening and referral comprise the second most frequent reason (15%) for patient encounters. Treatment for disorders associated with genitourinary conditions account for 11% of the UMDNJ-SOM DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE (SOM) The SOM Department of Family Medicine has formed an interdisciplinary partnership with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Graduate School of Social Work to teach a course entitled \"Cultural Competency and Interdisciplinary Healthcare Delivery.\" Through this course, medical students, graduate students in social work and other healthcare professionals from the community are trained to be culturally competent and skilled in interdisciplinary healthcare delivery. The Area Health Education Centers support this course by providing a two-w eek service-learning experience for these 170 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 medical students at host sites in a medica lly underserved community. Sites include a homeless shelter, an HIV/AIDS mobile van, a senior center, a primary care clinic, and a hospice.

of smok ing cessation outcome in a lar ge cohort of patients receiving intensive treatment for tobacco dependence Discovered that patients who smoke at night have worse outcomes, patients who use more than one pharmacotherapy have better outcomes, and patients who participate in group treatment have better outcomes UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS 238 Identified that compliance with evidence-b ased treatment was associated with improved treatment outcome, as was older age and having more than two children Determined that clinicians should encourage smokers who relapse after an initial treatment episode to return for treatment, and repeat treatment should focus on addressing high nicotine dependence and potentially co-occurring mental health problems in order to improve cessation outcomes Identified that the odds of in itiating daily smoking were significantly lower for men who had started using snus than for those who had not (i.e, use of snus is associated with a reduced risk of becoming a daily smoker and an increased likelihood of stopping smoking) Showed that obese patients had 25% decre ased odds of being screened for colorectal cancer compared to non-obese patients Determined that pulmonologists, cardiologists, and family physicians had the highest levels of familiarity and referral with r egards to physicians' utilization of tobacco treatment services Determined that psychiatrists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, and surgeons had the lowest levels of familiarity and referral with regards to physicians' utilization of tobacco treatment Determined that physicians who were younger, female, who had more teaching hours and who accepted fewer new patients all had higher ra tes of referral with regards to physicians' utilization of tobacco treatment services Studied nicotine-dependence treatment in psychiatric comorbidity Characterized the functional significance of all the reported missense CYP2A13 genetic polymorphisms, and identified a \"null\" allele wh ich will help in the selection of appropriate CYP2A13 polymorphisms in human cancers re lated to NNK and aflatoxin exposure Showed that prostate-specific 10-year ival for low-grade cancers was similar after prostatectomy, radiotherapy and conservative management, but survival of patients with high-grade cancers was significant ly better after prostatectomy Discovered, by examining the rates of radical prostatectomy in Medicare beneficiaries before and after the introduction of PSA testing, a rapid increase in radical pr ostatectomies following the introduction of PSA testing, followed by a sharp decline particularly in older and white men Examined the interval after PSA screening and su bsequent risk of incurable prostate cancer and found that, among those diagnosed with prostate cancer, the risk of non-localized cancer did not differ between those tested two or three years prior to diagnosis and those tested one year prior to diagnosis Discovered that the rate of PSA screening among men aged 75 or older was 32.5%, which was greater than that of fecal occult blood screening among men, despite lack of evidence suggesting a benefit of PSA screening in this elderly population Demonstrated for the first time in a cohort the association of occupational exposure to hydrocarbons and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Demonstrated best practices for spatial analysis and mapping of health statistics to inform policymakers and the public RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September

through an individualized intensive research training progr am that includes the enrollment of primary care clinicians in the Masters of Public Health program Demonstrated that strength training and aerobi c exercise offer similar benefits in enhancing both fitness and psychological well-being in elderly obese women Demonstrated that caregiver burden and sati sfaction are significantly associated with spouses' depression, and that burden has a cross-partner effect on patient's depression Discovered that caregiving dyads coping with ES RD show high levels of stability in depressive symptoms over time, yet variabilit y within dyads is greater than between dyads Found that Black and white spouses, but not Bl ack and white patients, expressed significantly different preferences regarding dialysis conti nuation, as explained by caregiver burden and, to a lesser degree, spouse's report of patient health Demonstrated that there is more stability than change in patient preferences regarding continuation of dialysis over t he course of one year, indicating that it is possible to maintain the voice of the patient in end- of-life decisions when patients t hemselves are unable to do so Showed that a spouse's positive and negative affect is associated with the other spouse's positive and negative affect over time with in serious illness contexts such as ESRD Showed that changes in marital satisfaction are associated with changes in feelings of burden and benefit, and marital cohesion predicts decreases in care-related benefits in the context of ESRD Demonstrated that the patient and spouse's char acteristics are related to the quality of life of ESRD patients, their spouses, and the spouse's ratings of patient's quality of life Found evidence that caregivers recruited us ing volunteer sampling are significantly more burdened, less satisfied, more depressed, and provide more help to care-recipients than those recruited by random digit-dialing me thods and age-targeted listed households, which raises questions about the extent to which da ta gathered from volunteer samples can be generalized Ascertained that listed-h ousehold sampling methods produce samples of older adult populations similar to those achieved by random digit-dial methods, and at a considerable savings Opened the NJISA Research Call Center, a 19-stationed computer-assisted telephone interviewing facility Launched ORANJ BOWL, a longitudinal health study of New Jersey residents who are between 50 and 74 years of age, and recruited 1680 respondents Participated in the

The college, located at Jersey City Medical Center, enrolled its first class in 1956. It was the forerunner of the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, the UMDNJ-New Jersey Dental School and the UMDNJ-Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. 1962 New Jersey's first public program of medical education was chartered as part of Rutgers University. The Rutgers Medical School opened in 1966 as a two-year basic science institution offering the master of medical science (MMS) degree. 1965 The Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry was acquired by the State of New Jersey and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (NJCMD). Two years later, the medical school relocated to temporary facilities in Newark, although the dental school remained in Jersey City until 1977. 1968 Martland Hospital, formerly Newark City Hospital, was acquired by the State as the primary teaching facility for NJCMD. Closed as a health care facility in 1979, the Martland Building was renamed the Stanley S. Bergen Building in 1999 and currently houses the UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions, the UMDNJ- School of Nursing, the Newark campus of the UMDNJ-School of Public Health and various administrative and clinical offices. The Newark Agreements, a historic social contract among federal, state and local governments and the Newark community, were signed on March 1, clearing the way for the construction of a major academic health center in Newark's Central Ward. 1969 The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences was founded as a separate and independent school of NJCMD. 1970 The Medical and Dental Education Act of 1970, signed into law by Governor Cahill on June 16, created the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (CMDNJ) by merging NJCMD with the medical school of Rutgers University under a single board of trustees. 1971 Stanley S. Bergen, Jr., M.D., was named the first president of CMDNJ on July 1. The following week, ground was broken for construction of a $200-million Campus in Newark. 1972 The Community Mental Health Center at Piscataway was dedicated. The UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (then known as CMDNJ- Rutgers Medical School) matriculated its first third-year class of M.D. candidates. The school graduated its first M.D.'s in 1974. 287 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 UMDNJ HISTORY 1975 The South Jersey Medical Education Act, signed into law by Governor Byrne, directed the University to establish both allopathic and osteopathic programs of medical education in South Jersey. 1976 The Newark Campus, which included the Medical Science Building, the Dental School Building, the Community Mental Health Center, the George F. Smith Library of the Health Sciences and a power plant, was dedicated. The UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions (then called CMDNJ-School of Allied Health Professions) was established on the Newark Campus as a separate school. The School of Osteopathic Medicine was chartered, enrolling its first class the following year and graduating New Jersey's first doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O.'s) in 1981. 1977 An affiliation agreement with Middlesex General Hospital (now known as the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital) established the New Brunswick hospital as the core teaching facility for the then CMDNJ-Rutgers Medical School, while Cooper Medical Center/University Medical Center, Camden, became the core teaching affiliate for t he Clinical Campus at Camden. In the same year, a pilot class of third-year students began taking clinical rotations at the Camden hospital. Kennedy Memorial Hospital became the core teaching hospital for the School of Osteopathic Medicine. 1979 UMDNJ-University Hospital (then called College Hospital) in Newark opened in January and was dedicated as the primary teaching hospital for the New Jersey Medical School. 1981 Legislation signed by Governor Byrne established CMDNJ as the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). Along with university status, UMDNJ was granted additional independence and flexibility within state government. UMDNJ became the largest free-standing public university of the health sciences in the United States. 1984 UMDNJ dedicated the Education and Research Building in Camden. It now houses the UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Clinical Campus at Camden. 1985 The Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, a joint research facility of UMDNJ and Rutgers University, was established. 1986 The Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, a joint facility of UMDNJ and Rutgers University, was established. UMDNJ-Rutgers Medical School officially adopted UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School as its name, and Mi ddlesex General University Hospital became Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. 288 UMDNJ HISTORY UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2007 1989 An addition to the Camden Education and Research Building, designed to house the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, was dedicated. 1990 The Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine dedicated its new building on the Piscataway Campus. The Education and Research Building on the Stratford Campus was opened, bringing programs that had been held in Stratford and Piscataway together in a single location. The UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine's consolidation in Stratford also permitted the UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School to unify its programs, offering all basic sciences in Piscataway, with clinical education in New Brunswick and Camden. 1991 The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), the first and only multidisciplinary, medical school-based clinical cancer center in the state, was formed as a partnership of UMDNJ, RWJMS, and the New Brunswick Affiliated Hospitals. The Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, a joint facility of UMDNJ and Rutgers University, dedicated its new facility on the Piscataway Campus. 1992 The UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School Doctors Office Center was opened on the Newark Campus. Governor Florio signed into law The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Flexibility Act of 1992. The la w reaffirmed the University's expanded mission in the areas of nursing and health related professions, strengthened opportunities to form partnerships and collaborations, and provided the University with the structural flexibility to pursue the development, manufacture or marketing of products, technology, or scientific information, and the delivery of health care services directly or through joint ventures. The UMDNJ-School of Nursing was created as the seventh school of the University. 1993 The UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medi cine dedicated the Academic Center and a laboratory expansion at its Science Center, providing for additional educational and research facilities. 1995 The UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School dedicated a new complex for the Eric B.
