A fungus, (Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum ), new to the United States and detected in Connecticut during October of 2011, caused heavy mortality of boxwood plants in our nurseries and landscape settings. Stop sale notices were issued to businesses that had infected plants. The infected plants were destroyed by burial or i ncineration. Experiments on fungicide control were initiated to develop a control strategy. The diagnostic laborat ory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology kept up with heavy demands to identify fungus infections. In another important program, there has been extensive monitoring for the emerald ash borer (Agrilus plannipennis ), an important insect pest of ash trees, at more than 100 sites in the state. A solitary wasp (Cerceris fumipennis ), which hunts beetles in the family Buprestidae (including the emerald ash borer), is the main focus of the bio- surveillance effort. The hot summer of 2012 caused a heavy buildup of mosquitoes infected with the West Nile encephalitis virus. There were at least seven human cases. A new formulation was developed to control bed bugs, and a provisional patent application was filed. Analy tical chemists were busy testing foods for unwanted chemicals. New knowledge has been gained on e valuating grape cultivars , a variety of niche crops for growers , and monitoring for powdery mildew infections in vineyards. A new project was started on growing hops for the microbrewery industry. Biochemists made new discoveries on the development of plant leaves and photosynthesis. Good progress has been made on improving our buildings. The architectural plans for the Jenkins-Waggoner Laboratory are in the final stages. Construction has started on the Griswold Laboratory, and the pre- design phase plans for the Valley Laboratory renovations are nearly complete. The Experiment Station's outreach and service components complement the research programs by providing new information to our state residents. More than 22,000 people received answers to their questions, an d there were more than 2 million page views on our website. New facts sheets were posted on a regular basis. 6 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 BOARD OF CONTROL The management of The Station is vested in a Board of Control as specified in Section 22-79 of the General Statutes of Connecticut.

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 13 The day's activities began at 10:00AM with short talks under the main tent. At 11:20AM Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli welcomed all visitors to Lockwood Farm. The Century Farm Award was presented by Dr. John F. Anderson to the family at Collins Powder Hill Farm from Enfield, CT. Collins Powder Hill Farm, at 9 Powder Hill Road in Enfield, Connecticut, was established in 1868. Fruits, vegetables and tobacco, as well as a few animals, were grown on the farm. In the 1900's, an apple orchard became the new enterprise for the farm. Like many other Connecticut farms, diversification and adapting to changing times over the ye ars are cri tical to the survival of the farm. The Collins family developed a well-known chicken farm raising mostly breeding stock. Cows were then introduc ed and a dairy operation co -existed with egg and meat production. Today the principal family member s (John and Ashley Collins and Jack and M avis Collins) oversee a 180- acre farm with a dair y herd of about 170 cows, which includes an extensive br eeding program of Holstein and Jersey stock, a composting business, and a cre amery where premium ice cream is sold. Corn and alfalfa are now important crops. The Collins family has about 158 acres in farmland preservation. Numerous family members and employees over several generations have contributed to the success of the farm. After the Century Farm Award was presented, Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli introduced Mr. Gregory M. Schaan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Imperial Nurseries, Inc. in Granby, Connecticut. Mr. Schaan was The Samual W. Johnson Memorial Lecturer . He gave the talk \"Impact of the Nursery Industry on Connecticut's Economy\". After a brief presentation by the Experiment Station Associates, the morning's program was ended.

I. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Analyses are conducted across a wide range of sample matrices submitted to the Department of Analytical Chemistry by other State agencies, municipalities, police departments, non -profit groups, businesses, and other departments at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES). This list is not intended to be all- inclusive. 1. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Analytical Chemistry has two long -standing programs with the CT Department of Agriculture (DoAg) involving the analysis of feed and fertilizer products. a. Animal Feeds: Analysts: Craig Musante, John Ranciato Goal: To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in 1875. Products for household pets and commercial agricultural operations are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from the DoAg. Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn report findings to the product dealer and/or manufacturer. From July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, we completed analysis of 18 feed samples. These samples were analyzed for parameters such as protein, fat, moisture, fiber, and micronutrients. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 12 (66.7%). Analytical findings were turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory response. b. Fertilizers : Analysts: Craig Musante, John Ranci ato Goal: To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. 98 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in 1875.

Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn reports findings to the product dealer and product manufacturer. From July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, we completed analysis of 25 samples for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, and potash, and for micronutrients, including but not limited to, boron, sulfur, cobalt, magnesium, and iron. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 9 (36.0%). Analytical findings were turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory response. c. Analysis of seafood samples associated with the March 2012 Norwal k Fire Analysts: William Berger, Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer Summary : On March 28, 2012, an industrial fire occurred in Norwalk at a scrap metal recycling facility. Nearly 300,000 gallons of water was used to put out the burning diesel engines, electrical parts, and multiple other components present in the material. Contam inated water, sediment and the ash from the fire was transported directly into the storm water system that ultimately discharges into Long Island Sound. DoAg Aquaculture Bureau Staff took pictures of a heavy gray sediment covering the oysters along the sh oreline in that location the following day. The Bureau closed all shellfishing in Norwalk and the adjacent towns and requested organic contaminant analysis of the seafood by Department staff. Over the course of several weeks, collected seafood samples were analyzed for both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Impact: Results from the Analytical Chemistry Department's analyses were used to demonstrate a return to pre-fire levels of key organic contaminants and we re used to facilitate the re-opening of closed shellfish beds. 2. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , FOOD AND STANDARDS DIVISION Analyses conducted by the Analytical Chemistry department for the CT Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are important to public safety. The results of these analyses are reported in a timely fashion and can lead to the recall of products that have levels of chemical residues deemed unacceptable by regulatory agencies. a. Pesticide residues in food: Analysts: Walter Krol, Brian determine concentrations of agrochemicals in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale in CT and to assure compliance with established tolerances. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 99 Market basket survey samples are collected by Inspector Ellen Sloan of the DCP. Results are published in an annual Station bulletin available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes . From July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, 255 samples of fresh (151; 59.2%) and processed (104; 40.8%) samples were analyzed for pesticide residues. Beginning January 1, 2006, all market basket samples were analyzed using the QuEChERS method, providing lower limits of d etection and increased number of detectable agrochemicals (see figure). Please see past Records of the Year and Station bulletins for details. Of the 255 samples analyzed, 194 (76.1%) contained a total of 568 residues. There were 87 different pesticide active ingredients found. The three most commonly detected residues were the fungicide thiophanate methyl found was 0.192 ppm, and the average number of pesticide residues per sampl e containing residues was 3.88. The impact on our program of fully implementing QuEChERS is shown graphically below. Note that the number of residues observed and the proportion of samples with residues have dramatically increased. At the same time, the average residue concentration has decreased by a factor of 10. This is because the new technique allows for the detection of many more pesticides at much lower concentrations. Our collaborative project with the CT Department of Public Health (DPH) to simultaneously test food in the marketplace for both pesticide residues and potentially harmful pathogens continued, although at a reduced scale. Utilizing the collection and regulatory arm of the CT DCP, 5 of the aforementioned food samples were split at collection to undergo concurrent chemical and microbial analysis. No microbial pathogens were observed; however, two of the samples were found to contain violative pesticide residues. The first was a sample of fresh mint which contained residues of imidacloprid (0.007 ppm) and the second was chopped lettuce which was found to contain residues of pendimethalin (0.003 ppm). Neither pesticide is allowed on these commodities, thus resulting in no tolerance violations. Impact: The Department of Analytical Chemistry's Market -basket program serves as the sole surveillance and monitoring effort in the state, assuring that the food supply within CT is safe and free from adulteration. 0100200300400500600 0102030405060708090 Number of Chemicals Detected (Line) % of With Chemical Residues (Bars) 100 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 b. Miscellaneous samples Analyst: John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, 110 samples were submitted for analytical requests such as foreign material identification, possible product adulteration or tampering. For some samples, we rely on the expertise in other departments, including Plant Pathology & Ecology, Entomology, and Forestry & Horticulture. c. Infant formula samples Analyst: Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault, John Ranciato Summary : In early 2012, 20+ consumer complaints were received at the W omen, Infants, and C hildren (WIC) Program concerning Nutramigen-based products. The complaints included off-color or appearance but most infants that consumed the formula experienced projectile vomiting and diarrhea. Both liquid and powdered samples were delivered to the Department for chemical analysis. Samples were extracted and analyzed for over 850 pesticides, poisons, and toxins. Since the samples appeared to have large globular fat- like material in the solution, total fat content was measured. All samples were found to be free of chemical contamination and the fat content matched the label claim. A final determination was made that the emulsification of the fats in the formula was compromised and this phenomena may have been exacerbated by exposure to low temperature. In consultation with Department scientists, CT DPH laboratory personnel, and DCP officials, this product was removed from the CT State WIC nutrition program. Impact: Results from the Analytical Chemistry Department's analyses were used to identify the source of product deficiency and to justify product removal from the WIC program, thereby protecting a sensitive population of CT citizens. 3. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION a. Beverages/products for ethanol content Analyst: Terri Arsenault Goal: To provide % ethanol content for label registration and taxation purposes. Summary : We analyzed 34 products such as beers, wines, and liquors for ethanol content. The average % ethanol content for beers, wines and liquors were 6.07, 12.6, and 38.7%, respectively. b. Beverage authenticity Analyst: Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault Goal: To determine if products offered to customers at CT establishments are authentic as to brand. Summary : 32 alcoholic products were examined for authenticity; 4 samples were found to not match the chromatographic profile of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 101 comparison authentic samples. These results are returned to the Division of Liquor Control, who determines appropriate regulatory acti on. A research project has been initiated to investigate the potential use of conductivity measurements, which can be made with field portable probes, to screen samples for adulteration and authenticity. 5. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEEP), WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU a. Analysis of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) Analysts: Brian Eitzer, William Berger Goals: To ascertain the extent of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination. Common matrices include soils, waters, oils, sediments, surface wipes. Summary : From July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, 51 samples were analyzed from pre- existing sites and/or spill locations in CT. The sample collection by DEEP is part of mandatory long- term monitoring of these are as. As such, the findings are reported to DEEP for assessment of continued regulatory compliance. b. Analysis of pesticides Analysts: Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault, Christina Robb, William Berger Goals: To ascertain pesticide concentration associated with misapplication or drift in support of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Additional samples are analyzed in support DEEP surface and groundwater monitoring programs. Matrices include soils, waters, oils, sediments, surface wipes. Water, vegetation and soil samples can now be analyzed for glyphosate using liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Summary : From July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, 101 samples were analyzed under this program. Impact: Groundwater samples are screened for atrazine, imidacloprid, alachlor, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive samples are then confirmed by chromatography (gas [GC] and liquid [LC]) with mas s spectrometry. We have discovered that the ELISA screen produces a large number of false positive results for atrazine. This finding is significant as other water monitoring programs may rely exclusively on ELISA, which overestimates the presence of atrazine in the environment. 6. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES a. Analysis of samples for FDA Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Analysts: Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Brian Eitzer, Craig Musante, Christina Robb, Walter Krol, Kittipath Prapayotin -Riveros Summary : The Analytical Chemistry department has a Cooperative Agreement with the US FDA to conduct research and analyses related to chemical contaminants in food. The Department has successfully participated in proficiency tests and surveillance assignments for pesticides, toxins, metals and other contaminants 102 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 on several different analytical instruments. The Department is currently participating in an exercise involving the analysis of food samples related to the upcoming National Political Conventions. b. Analysis of samples for municipalities Analysts: Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Brian Eitzer, Walter Krol, Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, Department staff analyzed 41 samples for municipalities. After removal of the Occupy New Haven protesters from the city green, several soil samples were analyzed for both heavy metal and organic ch emical contamination. The soils were found to be equivalent to samples from control locations on the green. In addition, the Connecticut Agricultural Education Foundation (CTAEF) requested analysis of several soil samples taken from different elementary school grounds. Impact: The soil samples from the CTAEF were from taken from areas that were to be used by school- age children for vegetable gardens. The program is called \"Ag in the classroom\" and students will be planting, growing, and harvesting vegetables on school grounds. The food would then be donated to the school cafeterias for general consumption. Our results were returned with instructions to consult the DPH and the CT DEEP for data review. c. Analysis of candy for lead (Pb) content Analysts: Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : The New Haven Health Department has been concerned that the blood lead levels of certain ethnic groups in the city have not been declining as anticipated given current abatement efforts. As a result, approximately 30 samples of candy imported from Mexico and Central America were collected New Haven Health Inspectors and were analyzed by Department staff for P b content. The level of concern for Pb in candy is 100 parts per billion (ppb). Of the samples analyzed, 8 were found to exceed this limit (210-470 ppb). Impact: In response to our findings, New Haven Health Inspectors pulled certain products from store shelves. In addition, the Health Inspectors have amended their interview protocol for school age children to include questions about candy consumption. The Department is currently supporting both the state and city in an ongoing surveillance of these products. d. Analysis of samples for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Analysts: Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer Summary : The Analytical Chemistry department works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Weapons of Mass Destruction The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 103 Coordinator (WMD) out of the New Haven Field Office on issues related to chemical terrorism and the food supply. If requested, the department will provide chemical analysis on select samples. During the current reporting period, a sample consisting of an unknown liquid was found on the grounds of the FBI office in New Haven. After initial field screening, the sample was brought to the Analytical Chemistry department to rule out specific chemical agents of concern. The sample was found to contain nothing hazardous. 7. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS a. Analyses related to pollinator decline- Department of Entomology Analyst: Brian Eitzer Summary : Upon request from Dr. Kim berly Stoner in the Entomology Department, we determine concentrations of agrochemicals in pollen and wax to ascertain possible relationship to bee health. LC/MS methods have been developed for low level detection of pesticides. See Research section below. b. Analysis of Pesticides in Tobacco Leaves- Valley Laboratory Analysts: Walter Krol Summary : The Department received approximately 10 samples of tobacco leaves from Dr. James Lamondia at the Valley Laboratory. Department staff extracted and analyzed these samples for pesticide residues. 8. A NALYSIS OF CHECK SAMPLES Analysts: Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Christina Robb, Brian, Eitzer, Craig Musante Summary : Annual performance evaluation samples required by our certifying agency, CT DPH, as well as annual proficiency testing samples related to our FDA FERN work, and the AAPCO Check Sample program (pesticide formulations) were completed during the reporting period. Our reported results exceeded required criteria in all instances. II. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Research projects in the Department of Analytical Chemistry include applied and fundamental studies. Research is often stimulated by our service work and in turn, research results often impact service activities. 1. FOOD SAFETY Project 1: Comparison of Methods for Determination of Pesticide Residues in Food Investigators : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer Summary: The implementation and validation of more sensitive extraction methods for pesticides in food more accurately reflects the residues present in food commodities. This 104 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 information increases the effectiveness of food safety surveillance and also more accurately informs the consumer as to the residues present in the food they purchase. An extensive comparison of our previous extraction method, the VegPrep, with the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS) method is ongoing. In summary, the QuEChERS method can detect greater numbers of pesticides at concentrations of up to ten- times lower than previously used methods. A peer review manuscript describing these findings has been conditionally accepted for publication. Project 2: Validation of FERN Methods: The Ricin Capacity and Capability Exercise Investigators : Christina Robb, William Berger, Terri Arsenault Summary: Integral to our Cooperative Agreement with the FDA is the assessment of procedures for detecting toxins and pesticides in foods. The development of rapid, sensitive and accurate methods for chemical detection increases the robustness of food safet y and security systems in the United States. In conjunction with the CT DPH, a USDA FSIS FERN microbiology or mCAP laboratory, the Department participated in the November 2011 Ricin Capacity and Capability exercise. A total of 200 unhomogenized meat samples were sent to CT DPH but on the notice given, the capacity of DPH laboratory was 50 samples. The samples included ground meat, hot dogs, roast meats, jerky, quiche, breaded chicken nuggets, pigs- in-a- blanket and hams. In support of CT DPH, CAES agreed to participate in the exercise using the ELISA-16 method and accepted 80 samples into the laboratory. At CAES, three analysts and three hoods were dedicated to this exercise for 5 days. Meat samples were homogenized in a fume hood with a Robot Coupe food processor; hardware decontamination between samples was of significant concern during this exercise. By day 5, all 80 samples had been homogenized, extracted, and analyzed (in duplicate); for the 13 positive samples, the amount of ricin was estimated. Res ults were emailed to CT DPH on a daily basis; our laboratory had 100% accuracy using the ELISA-16 method. Impact: The Department demonstrated our ability to work under simulated emergency response conditions, processing and analyzing a large number of samples with 100% accuracy. This capability serves to protect both the food supply of both the state of CT and of the nation. Project 3: Validation of FERN Methods - Comparison of the DART to GC- MS/ LC-MS for the detection of pesticide residues in herbs Investigators : Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer Summary : As part of a Market -basket program, the CT DCP brings fresh and manufactured food samples to our laboratory for pesticide residues analysis. After finding large numbers of violative residues in fresh and dried herbs (18 out of 24 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 105 dried samples, 14 out of 15 fresh samples) in 2011, CAES began a study with the Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) on a direct comparison of the DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time) with our in house QuEChERS GC-MS and LC- MS/MS techniq ues. The DART is a mass spectrometer that is being considered for deployment with Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) to test imported food for chemical contamination in real time before entry into the United States. The results of this comparison, where the DART performed remarkably well, was presented by FCC staff (Dr. Sara Robinson) at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) meeting in Vancouver (May 2012). Impact: By assisting in the validation of a powerful new screening tool for use by the FDA and CBP, the Department continues to contribute to the overall safety of the nation's food supply. 2. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING/REMEDIATION Project 1: Nanoparticle contamination of agricultural crops Investigators: Craig Musante, Roberto De La Torre Roche, Jason C. White Summary : Nanomaterials (NM) have at least one dimension less than 100 nm and this small size results in unique properties not observed with equivalent bulk particles. Current nanomaterial use is ubiquitous; over 1300 NM-containing products are commercially available in areas such as electronics, health -care, cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. Of special concern to our laboratory is the use of nanomaterials in agriculture, including pesticides and fertilizers d irectly applied to food crops. From a regulatory perspective, nanomaterials are considered to have the same risk and toxicity profile as the equivalent bulk material. However, recent data out of our laboratory and others have suggested that this assumption may not be true. This potential lack of understanding on NM fate and effects in agricultural systems is disconcerting given that food crop contamination could be a significant uncharacterized pathway of human exposure. Two new USDA competitive grants are funding research to define the impact of NMs on food crops, with a focus on the risk posed to humans from exposure to these contaminated plants. Co -investigators on this grant include professors at the University of Massac husetts, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF), and Southern Illinois University-Carbondale. Another concern being investigated in this research is the impact of nanomaterials on the fate and effects of other chemicals present in agricultural systems. In a separate collaboration with Dr. Jason Kelsey of Muhlenberg College (Allentown, PA), the impact of carbon nanomaterials on both plants and worms in single and multispecies exposure scenarios is being investigated. Preliminary results have shown that although carbon 106 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 nanomaterials may impact plant health and the fate of co -contaminants in model systems (hydroponics, vermiculite), the effect in soil- based systems may be significantly less. Impact: Our research demonstrates that the toxicity of nanoparticles to agricultural plant species can be significantly greater than that observed for the corresponding non-nano or bulk material. The results also suggest that nanomaterials may alter the fate and effects of other agricultural chemicals. These findings have implications for the widespread use of nanomaterials in commercially available products. Project 2: Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with weathered persistent organic pollutants (POPs) Investigators: William Berger, Jason C. White Summary: This project illustrates the overlap of service and research in the Department. In 1990, samples from our market basket survey were found to contain chlordane, although the registration for this insecticide had long been terminated. Our research has shown that some agrochemicals such as DDT and chlordane have half -lives in soil of years or decades. Several separate lines of investigation were pursued to determine the potential of plants to remediate soils contaminated with these pollutants. Previous work has demonstrated that zucchini cultivars have remarkable abilities to phytoextract the weathered residues but that significant crop variability may exist down to the subspecies level. Specifically, zu cchini cultivars have the ability to accumulate contaminants whereas other squash do not. In ongoing field trials in CT and in collaboration with Professor Mehmet Isleyen (Sakarya University) in Turkey, previously created hybrid F1, F1 backcross, and hybrid F2 cultivars are being evaluated for the contaminant accumulation potential. In addition, grafting techniques are being applied to both contaminant accumulating and non-accumulating cultivars to investigate the mechanisms of phytoremediation. Separate laboratory based hydroponic investigations are continuing to investigate the role of aquaporins, water channels in the membranes of plant root The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 107 cells, in providing entry into the cell for POPs. These root pores are known to transport a variety of small solutes and hydrogen peroxide is known to temporarily close aquaporin channels. Previous hydroponic studies have shown that this closure corresponds to decreased chlordane uptake by zucchini. Current investigations are focusing on the effect of a range of peroxide concentrations on the uptake of another persistent organic pollutant, DDE, by a number of different zucchini and squash cultivars. Impact: The ability to accumulate and translocate weathered POPs is a unique ability restricted to zucchini. Mechanistic and inheritance studies will enable characterization underlying molecular basis for this phytoextraction ability, which will then permit optimization of this ability in zucchini or transfer of the gene(s) to other plant species. Project 3: Investigating the organic contaminant burden of the Mill and Quinnipiac River watersheds Investigators: Terri Arsenault, Jason C. White, Professor Harry Py lypiw Summary : In collaborative studies with Professor Harry Pylypiw of Quinnipiac University, the presence of pesticides, phthalates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in river sediments and water throughout south- central CT is being investigate d. Impact: Research of this nature will not only allow a characterization of the current state of watershed contamination but will also provide baseline data for future monitoring activities. Project 4: Analysis of Pesticides in Connecticut Pollen - Baseline Survey Investigators: Brian Eitzer and Kim Stoner (Dept. of Entomology) Summary: We are conducting research into how honey bees get exposed to pesticides during foraging. A honey bee can travel up to two miles from its hive as it collects pollen for use as food. During this time, the honey bee can be exposed to pesticides used in the residential or agricultural fields from which it collects. We have been collecting pollen from honey bee hives that represent urban , suburban and rural locations. The pollen is being collected from the same location for a period of several years allowing us to look at time trends within the data. During the past year we have started to inco rporate the use of high resolution mass spectrometry into our pesticide screening techniques allowing us to determine a larger number of pesticides and pesticide metabolites. Impact: Honey bees are being exposed to pesticides. Long- term monitoring from the same hives and locations provides baseline data that can be used to assess trends and changes in pesticide exposure. Project 5: Coordinated Agricultural Program on Honey Bee Health Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Keith Delaplane (University of Georgia, Lead Principal Investigator) Summary: This is a large multi-institutional project (over 20 funded investigators from 15 different institutions) that is considering issues related to the health of honey bees and other 108 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 native pollinators. These issues rela te to various pathogens and parasites (colony collapse disorder, Nosema , Varroa mites, etc.), as well as management practices. One of the threats to honey bees is use of pesticides in agricultural settings as well as w ithin the beekeeping community. The role of the CAES within this project is the analysis of pesticide residues. These residues will be examined as a part of several separate research projects inclu ded within the overall program. Pesticide residues will be examined in pollen taken from sent inel apiaries (apiaries maintained by University researchers) on a monthly basis so that pesticide exposure can be examined as a co -factor in studies on honey bee health. In addition, the wax from these hi ves will also be examined. Our results from these apiaries show that the pesticide content varies not only with sampling date and location but also within hives from the same location and time. The pesticide data are currently being correlated against various measures of hive health. Impact: Analysis of pesticide residues from apiaries that are being intensively monitored for infectious agents and colony health will allow us to determine if they are a co -factor in some of the problems being faced by honey bees. Project 7: Quantifying routes of exposure of honey bees to neo-nicotinoid seed treatments of corn Investigators: Brian Eitzer, Greg Hunt, and Christian Krupke (Dr. Hunt and Dr. Krupke are at Purdue University - Dr. Krupke is the PI) Summary: Production of corn for food and feed (and recently fuel) represents the largest single use of arable land in North America. Pest management in corn (which includes scouting/monitoring and applying pesticides as needed) has been replaced by a form of risk management, where each seed is treated for management of a broad suite of pests (primarily insects and nematodes). Neonicotinoids thoroughly dominate this market. Virtually every corn kernel planted in North America (the lone exception being organic production = 0.2% of total acreage) is coated with neonicotinoid insecticides at approximately 0.5 mg/kernal. The nature of these molecules ensure that insecticide activity extends not only to the roots, but to the above-ground plant parts as well. The major compounds used are highly toxic to bees with LD50 values in the 0.02-0.03 ng/bee range. Given that corn is typically planted at a rate of 31,000 kernels/acre, it is essential that any potential routes for pollinator exposure be evaluated. We are monitorin g for these neonicotinoid pesticides in samples of honey bees, honey bee pollen, soil, talc dust from seed planters, and dandelions from fields surrounding corn fields to try to determine possible exposure routes. We have found that the talc dust can contain very high concentrations of these pesticides. All of the samples are being analyzed using the QuEChERs extraction protocol and LC/MS/MS. We are currently examining dosimeters placed next to fields during planting to examine how the dust moves off sit e. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 109 The above photos of are of treated corn seed and dust from planters (courtesy of Purdue Department of Entomology). Impact: Knowledge of routes of exposure of honey bees to pesticides is important if we hope to minimize the impact of pesticide use on pollinators of our food crops. PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/internet inquiries : We receive 400 -500 calls from the public each yea r requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and the environment, heavy metals in paint, food, soils, and consumer products. In some instances, we refer the caller to a more appropriate CAES Department or State agency. 110 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS Protecting Honeybee Hives from American Foulbrood Disease: Dr. Douglas W. Dingman , assisted part -time by Regan Huntley, continued investigations on the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae: causative agent of the disease American of honey bees ( Apis mellifera ). He has extended his investigations to include the Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae . In apiaries were visited for conducting the multi- year survey of AFB prevalence in Connecticut. The level of AFB (sub-clinical and clinical infections) in Connecticut for FY 2011-2012 was 50% of the apiaries tested. However, the overall percentage of hives infected was near 15%. Testing of P. larvae isolates for resistance to oxytetracyclin e-hydrochloride (i.e., Terramycin used by beekeepers to control AFB), via culturing and PCR techniques, did not identify any new apiaries as containing tetracycline resistant P. larvae. Since the beginning of the AFB investigation in 2007, only six differ ent apiaries in Connecticut have been identified as containing antibiotic- resistant P. larvae. The genomic RFLP analysis investigation of P. larvae isolates is nearing completion and isolates collected outside of the United States are being compared to iso lates collected in Connecticut for production of a geographic distribution profile. Long-term infection profiles for two apiaries are being performed for AFB and nosemosis. These profiles will be useful for time- line comparative analysis of sanitation/tre atment procedures. Database entry of all registered beekeepers in Connecticut for the years 2007 -2010 has been completed. Apiary registrations for 2011 are being added to the database. Due to inadequate support, survey results obtained for all the AFB is olates will be linked to this database for future GIS mapping analysis as time permits. Starting August 2010, honey bee samples collected in Connecticut were examined for presence of the microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae using a PCR diagnostic test. For 30 different Connecticut apiaries, comprising 120 hives, 57% of the apiaries tested positive for N. ceranae (35% of the hives). No hives tested positive for N. apis . Microscopic analysis of hives testing positive for N. ceranae is being perfor med to estimate how many exceed the economic threshold (i.e., a population infection rate > 30%). Workshops to train Connecticut beekeepers on microscopic analysis of honey bees for nosema presence and estimation of the infection rate within a bee hive are beginning in collaboration with Mr. Mark Creighton (CT State bee inspector). Work with Mr. Mark Cooper (Director of Health, Westport/Weston Health District), Michael Pascucilla (Director of Health, East Shore District Health Department), Timothy Callahan (Director of Health, Norwalk Health Department), Dr. Adalgisa Caccone (Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies), and Lauren Brooks (Research Assistant, Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies) relating to microbial source tracking awaits pending funding The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 111 approval by Long Island Sound Futures Fund (US EPA, National Fish & Wildlife Foundation) for the cooperatively- submitted implementation grant. Impact American foulbrood and nosemosis diseases of honey bees cause significant economic losses to beekeepers and agr iculture, worldwide. Nosema ceranae , the major cause of nosemosis in Connecticut, is implicated in Colony Collapse Disorder and has been suggested as the cause of increased deaths during overwintering. This investigation continues to show a high presence of AFB within Connecticut beehives and is demonstrating an equally high prevalence of nosemosis in Connecticut apiaries. Beekeepers, being informed of the prevalence of these two diseases, are able to make informed decisions on control and treatment of di seased hives. Beekeepers are being trained to monitor hives for nosemosis as a first step in providing better methods of control. Advancing the molecular knowledge pertaining to P. larvae will provide information on host-pathogen interactions and possibl y result in new approaches to lower the impact of the disease. Genetic Regulation of Leaf Development Dr. Neil McHale assisted by Regan Huntley continued work on the genetic mechanisms governing growth and development in plants. Just as in animals, plants use mobile signal molecules known as hormones to regulate their pattern of growth. The most versatile of the plant hormones is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) also known as auxin, the discovery of which dates back to the time of Charles Darwin. To this day, plant physiologists and geneticists are working to uncover the molecular pathways that allow this simple compound to regulate such a myriad of plant growth patterns, including initiation of leaves, flowers, roots and fruit. Our work in auxin biology began with the isolation the LAM1 gene in tobacco, which is required for formation of leaf blades. The DNA sequence of LAM1 indicated that it was a member of the WOX super family of homeodomain transcription factors, which control developmental events throughout the plant. To determine when and where LAM1 is expressed, we fused the LAM1 promoter to a -glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and introduced it into wild-type plants. GUS staining revealed that vascular tissue of young leaf primordia was the primary location for LAM1 expression, although residual activity was observed in other tissue types. To determine whether vascular expression alone was sufficient to drive blade formation, we fused a vascular specific promoter from the SUC2 gene in Arabidopsis to the coding region of LAM1 and introduced this synthetic gene into bladeless mutant lam1 plants looking for restoration of blade formation. Similar transgenes employing other vascular promoters to drive LAM1 expression were also constructed and tested in this manner. In all but one case, vascular expression of LAM1 restored blade formation in lam1 mutant plants, demonstrating for the first time that molecular signals governing the lateral outgrowth of leaf blades originate in vascular tissue. Using a si milar approach, our collaborator Dr. Million Tadege (Oklahoma State Univ., Ardmore, OK) has analyzed the extent of functional overlap among WOX genes normally expressed in other plant organs, including roots and flowers. When expressed in the appropriate location for LAM1 in leaves, all of these genes can restore blade formation in mutant lam1 plants. Moreover, his work shows that a highly conserved C terminal domain found in all of these WOX genes is essential for this. This domain was initially identif ied in a WOX gene called WUSCHEL and is critical to 112 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 induction of cytokinin signaling, suggesting that blade formation must also hinge largely if not entirely on cytokinin induction. Impact Genes controlling patterns of plant development have been used e xtensively to make agriculturally important alterations in growth habit and time to flowering in a variety of crop plants. Genes like LAM1 can be used to tailor the development of leaf blades, the living solar panels that convert sunlight into energy required for photosynthesis. Our initial publications on the LAM1 gene were a critical cornerstone in the eventual isolation of this gene in the laboratory of Kiran Mysore (Noble Foundation, Ardmore, OK) by Dr. Million Tadege who made this the focus of his postdoctoral work in that lab. Research on LAM1 in alfalfa leaves continues to be the centerpiece of his program at Oklahoma State University where he is an assistant professor. Cloned genes and mutant strains from our program have likewise influenced the direction of investigations in many other research laboratories. Genetic Regulation of Photosynthesis Drs. Richard Peterson and Neil Schultes completed work on the role of the LHCB7 gene in photosynthesis. The nuclear LHCB7 gene is common in higher plants, encodes a transcript that is well expressed in a subset of leaf mesophyll cells, and is associated with a protein product that is homologous to pigment -binding components of the photosystem (PS) II peripheral antenna complex. We confirmed T -DNA insertion into coding regions of LCHB7 in two lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Physiological properties of wild type and AtLHCB7- deficient leaves (ecotype Columbia) were compared based on pigment content, CO 2 exchange, in vivo transmittance at 810 nm, and chlorophyll fluorescence. The latter two techniques are functional indicators for PSI and PSII, respectively. Key features of the mutant phenotype were confirmed by use of antisense technology and a hemizygous hybrid of the two AtLHCB7 insertion lines. Loss of AtLHCB7 expression significantly affected light utilization in PSII as characterized by a shift in the induction of photoprotective nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) to a lower irradiance threshold. The consequent decline in radiant energy capture by PSII was paralleled by an increase in Q A reduction in the mutant; mutually reinforcing effects that lower overall PSII quantum yield. This led to an initial hypothesis that AtLHCB7 -deficiency is associated with an increase in res istance to plastoquinol oxidation by cytochrome b6f caused, in turn, by a decrease in the lumenal pH (photosynthetic control). However, the latter was ruled out due to an absence of effects of AtLHCB7 genotype on: 1) the kinetics of the light -dark decline in the 810-nm signal, and 2) xanthophyll de -epoxidation state. We conclude that the pH -dependence of the conformational change prerequisite to NPQ formation in the PSII antenna complex is shifted upscale when AtLHCB7 is absent. Furthermore, this conform ational change is directly linked to an increased resistance to electron transfer from Q A- to the mobile plastoquinone Q B. The well documented superior photosynthetic and growth capacities of monocots possessing the C4 pathway of carbon assimilation has spurred efforts to introduce these characteristics into crop species that rely on the less efficient C3 mechanism. Recently , the third leaf of the 9 -day-old B73 maize leaf seedling was chosen as the C4 \"model\" system and characterized through a multidisciplinary systems approach including anatomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis (Li et al. Nature Genetics 4 2, 1060- 1067). We are compiling The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 113 physiological profiles of the B73 system to overlay on the above molecular information to aid in the elucidation of the complex program of gene expression culminating in the C4 syndrome. A key question that could aid in interpretation of molecular profiles is whether an observable transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis occurs during leaf development. A prominent attribute of C3 photosynthesis is Rubisco- catalyzed oxygenation of ribulose bisphosphate glycolate. Metabolic processing of glycolate is obligatorily associated with liberation of CO 2 coincident with assimilatory CO 2 fixation in the light (photorespiration). Thus, photorespiration raises the equilibrium atmospheric CO 2 concentration attained in a closed system when photosynthesis is balanced by CO 2 evolution (O 2/CO2 compensation point, ). We employ a closed system approach for measurement of using transparent plastic syringes and an infrared gas analyzer configured to integrate signals recorded after injection of gas samples into a flowing stream of N 2. Results indicate that above 3 cm from the base of the emerged portion of leaf 3 no effects of O 2 on can be detected consistent with negligible photorespiration. However, a modest O 2-dependent increase in is observed below this 3-cm boundary and is augmented as the more recently emerged base of the leaf is approached. This gradient suggests that C3 photosynthetic capacity may be highest in very young sink tissue shaded by the sheath at the base of leaf 3 (2 -4 cm above soil level). Dark respiration dominates metabolism in this barely pigmented region which complicates measurement of . Nevertheless, we have observed substantial and highly O 2-dependent excursions in CO 2 levels in sink tissue using the closed system method. Use of a Rubisco partitioning model suggests that, to the small extent that photosynthesis occurs, it is highly C3 in nature. Surprisingly, illumination results in a transition to C4 -like photosynthesis within the several-hour time frame of the experiment. This result could define a narrow zone in the developing leaf wherein light and/or accumulation of photorespiratory metabolites influence expression of critical regulatory genes leading to implementation of the C4 pathway. Impact The main impact of this work will be development of crop plants with higher photosynthetic capacity and able to withstand environmental stress. When water supply is limiting, for example, the photosynthetic apparatus can be damaged irreparably by continuous exposure to sunlight. Genes under investigation here contribute to protection from photodamage. Our work has had a direct influence on the course of related ongoing work in the labs of Dr. Agu Laisk, Department of Cell a nd Molecular Biology, University of Tartu, Estonia; Dr. Harry Frank of the Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut; Dr. Thomas Brutnell, Boyce Thompson Institute; and Dr. Tim Nelson (Yale University). Plant Nucleobase Transporters Dr. Neil Schultes assisted by Regan Huntley pursues studies on plant metabolism. Plants must synthesize all of the molecules needed for life from scratch. As a consequence, plants have an amazing and intricate capacity for primary and secondary metabolism - that is synthesis of metabolites (e.g. amino acids, proteins, DNA, starch, lipids, hormones etc.). Metabolites are in a constant state of flux in regards to concentration and distribution within plant cells and tissues. Understanding the rules governing this flux is an aim of biochemistry. Membrane bound transporters act as metabolite -specific gatekeepers that regulate traffic of metabolites between cellular compartments (chloroplasts, nuclei, vacuoles, mitochondria, peroxisomes and 114 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 endoplasmic reticulum). As such transporters are often key control points in plant biochemistry. Therefore , understanding how plant transporters function is an important goal for eventual enhancement of crop productivity. In our work we concentrate on the movement of a particular group of molecules called nucleobases. Nucleobases are essential for plants being the building blocks of DNA and RNA, key intermediates in the synthesis of plant hormone cytokinin and secondary metabolites such as caffine and main sources of nitrogen storage in seed endosperm. In plants, there are six different classes of transporters just for nucleobases. Our research defines the function for the nucleobase transporters in the nucleobase- ascorbate transporter (NAT), (AZG) an d cation symporter (NCS1) classes. The function of particular nucleobase transporters is determined in plants through mutational analysis and using a well defined microbe - brewers yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) - to produce individual nucleobase transporters and test transport characteristics. To assay the function of each individual nucleobase transporter, we clone the distinct nucleobase genes into yeast, produce the corresponding transporter and assay both radio-labeled uptake and toxic analogue grow. During the past year, we published a manuscript establishing that the Arabidopsis NCS1 transporter facilitates the movement of guanine, adenine and uracil - but not cytosine - across biological membranes. This is in contrast to the transport profiles of the canonical Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCS1 transporters - uracil or adenine, guanine and cytosine respectively. To determine if plant NCS1 transporter function in general diverged during evolution from the yeast NCS1 transport function, we isolated NCS1 transporter genes from species spanning the diversity of plant taxa. NCS1 transporter genes from algae were obtained and cloned into yeast expression vectors. Current experiments are underway to determine the solute transport specificities of these diverse NCS1 transporters. In a separate series of experiment s, we are investigating the function of the Arabidopsis NAT3 ( AtNAT3) gene through heterologous complementation in yeast using a 3H-xanthine uptake assay. Our initial results show that AtNAT3 functions as an efficient transporter of xanthine. Currently , we are assaying the transport profiles for the Arabidopsis NAT 1-8 transporters by a similar manner. In addition, we have investigated the function of the three maize AZG transporter genes. Initial results show that these genes encode for guanine and adenine transporters. Impact The movement of nitrogen and carbon-based compounds within plants is highly regulated by transporter proteins in the cell membrane. Understanding nitrogen and carbon use patterns by plants will have important implications for both basic plant biology as w ell as applied science. Developing plants that use fertilizer more efficiently is just one example of how results from this research may be applied. Our investigations on nucleobase- ascorbate transporter genes in plants has an impact on a number of other research laboratories investigating similar research interests. One example is our collaboration with Dr. Mourad on uracil transporter-encoding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 115 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a vari ety of service, research, pest surveillance, and regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Kenneth A. Welch Insect Inquiry Office. Sta ff in this office answer insect -related questions and identify insects and related ar thropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations. All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a major applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks, pests of field crops, nurseries, and orchards, wood-boring insects, and honey bees and other bee pollinators. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibility, in part, to ensure our nursery industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. The Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Connecticut. The industry estimates that environmental horticulture generates $1.022 billion gross income supporting 48,000 full and part-time jobs in Connecticut. In conjunction with regulatory activities, Department staff conducts a surveillance program in Connecticut for a variety of established pests and for exotic plant pests, some of regulatory concern, that represent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for plant pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. Examples are Ramorum blight (aka Sudden Oak Death), a fungus-like pathogen that can affect many plants, but that can be particularl y devastating to oaks, and two beetles, t he Asian longhorned beetle and emerald ash borer, that represent a threat to our maples (and other trees) and ashes, respectively. In addition, we participated in a regional Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Program s upported by the USDA. For plant diseases of regulatory concern, we work closely with the Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. We also conduct forest health surveys and a statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation and a gypsy moth egg mass survey. The results of our plant and forest surveys for 2010 may be found later in the Department's research activities along with summaries of our regulatory activities. The staff of the Department of Entomology also takes a lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experiment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's research at public events, health and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, Celebrating Agriculture in Woodstock, CT, the Garden Expo in Fairfield, CT, the Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, Norwalk -Wilton Tree Festival, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. Honey bees, butterflies, wood-boring beetles and/or ticks continue to be popular exhibits at these events. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Insect Inquiry Office: Dr. Gale Ridge and Rose Hiskes , with the assistance of Katherine Dugas on Forest Health and CAPS , answered questions from the public. The insect inquiry office in its present form has provided services for over 40 years. Insect identification services 116 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 date back to the earliest days of the institution starting with the first Annual Report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station published in 1877. The station announced that was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insect.....and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultural Science for the use and advantage of the citi zens of Connecticut\". The insect inquiry office is located on the top floor of the Jenkins Laboratory and receives thousands of visitors each year. However, in contrast to previous years when most inquiries were from visitors (around 60%), most of the inquiries this past year were from phone/cellphone calls (75% of total) to the office followed by visitors (17%), mail (5%), and e- mail (3%). The office served private citizens, pest control operators, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals, housing authorities, museums, municipalities, libraries, state government, and the news media. Between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 the insect inquiry office handled at least 7,703 recorded inquiries. There were 658 categories of inquiry including insects, arachnids, animals, use of pesticides, insect damage, general entomology, and horticultural issues. Of these 3583 (46%) were related to man and medical issues, 101 undetermined/general inquiries (2%), 3831 (48%) as natural resources, and 258 (4%) food related. Bed bug/bat bug inquiries remain the leading inquiry for the office with 1,411 (18.3%) of the identifications performed by the office. The bed bug webpage additionally had the highest level of activity. In order of numbers, the s econd highest query were ticks, followed by carpenter ants, hemlock woolly adelgid, white grubs, carpenter bees, Indian meal moths, carpet beetles, yellow jackets, squash vine borers, and cicada killers. Termite activity rose from 60 to 103 inquiries this past year. The office continues to lead in public outreach with numerous State and New England wide presentations and training programs for the emerald ash borer, Asian longhorn beetle, and bed bugs. The office serves private citizens, pest control professionals, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals and institutions, housing authorities, Number of inquiries from 1996- 2012 municipalities, state government and the media. CAES has also worked closely with the Yale Peabody Museum on a number of their exhibits. Their exhibit, Invasion of the Bloodsuckers, Bed Bugs and Beyond which closed in November 2011 used bed bugs from Dr. Ridge's colonies. Bird and Butterfly Garden: The Bird and Butterfly Garden is a partnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Spring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and The Connecticut Number of inquiries from FY 2005/2006 to FY 2011/2012.

Most maintenance and improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff. The garden is open to the public Monday- Friday 8:30 a.m.-4:00 p.m., it is closed on the weekends and state holidays. The ga rden creates several favorable habitats for our native birds, butterflies, and pollinating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Connecticut gardens. Plants are labeled for easy identification. The Bird & Butterfly Garden at Lockwood Farm is listed in the 'Nature Conservancy Open Days Directory for New England'. Jeffrey Fengler observed 12 different butterfly species, 1 species of moth, 13 species of birds, and 2 other animals around the garden on Plant Science Day August 3, 2011.

It consists of a variety of presentations by Station Staff on various aspects of research and findings of concern to forest ers in the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, USDA- APHIS-PPQ, and the forest health community. A sixth bed bug forum, organized by Dr. Gale E. Ridge , was held on October 6th, 2012 at the Station. It had guest speakers from Cornell University and Boston. They focused on the human side of the bed bug equation. Hoarding intervention and community approaches to bed bug management were subjects addressed during the forum. Tick Testing: Ticks, primarily the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis , had the highest number of specimens submitted for identification. Ticks are processed in the Tick Testing Laboratory at the Experiment Station by Elizabeth Alves and Bonnie Hamid . A total of 3,240 ticks feeding on humans were submitted for identification in 2011, of which 2,903 were the blacklegged tick or \"deer\" tick, Ixodes scapularis . Beginning in 2006, the policy was changed to only test engorged ticks. Therefore, of the ticks received in 2011, 1,513 (52.1%) were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal organism for Lyme disease, and 340 (22%) were found to carry this organism. 118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Natural Products for Tick Control: Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III and postdoctoral scientist Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj began studies on evaluation of natural products for tick control with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008. E xperiments were continued and completed in 2012 with the assistance of Heidi Stuber . Previously, we reported the r esults of field application of two formulations of nootkatone and a garlic-based product completed in 2010 and additional trials with garlic in 2011. Tick populations were low at participating properties in Fairfield County in 2012 and an additional trial with garlic could not be conducted. A decline in the activity of I. scapularis nymphs was also noted in our long- term monitoring sites in the towns of Old Lyme, Lyme, and E. Haddam, CT. In wooded plots, t here were 1.1, 0.8, and 0.3 nymphs per 100 m 2 sampled in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. A similar trend was evident on lawns (0.2, 0.08, and 0.06 per 100 m2). With 31 human Lyme disease cases for the three towns in 2010 and 17 cases in 2011, it is likely even fewer cases will be reported in 2012. Ticks and Tick-Associated Diseases : Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, Dr. Scott C. Williams, Dr. Steven J. Norris (University of Texas), and Dr. Erol Fikrig (Yale University), assisted by Tia Blevins, tested 557 recaptured white- footed Babesia microti captured and released in six tick -infested sites in Fairfield, New Haven, and Tolland Counties during 2007 through 2010. There was an overall recapture rate of 40%, but only four tagged mice were caught in two or more years. Seropositivity r ates were highly variable for B. burgdorferi (56% microti (11% to 84%), depending on the site and time of sampling; 206 (45%) of 463 seropositive mice had antibodies to all three pathogens. There were notable changes in antibody status for some mice from negative to positive (117 seroconversions) or from positive to negative (55 reversions). Impact: White-footed mice, reservoirs for all three pathogens, serve to infect immature Ixodes scapularis ticks that f eed on these rodents. These mice are ideal for monitoring infections in selected foci as a part of ecological and epidemiological studies. Knowledge of serologic reversions is important because white- footed mice may be able to eliminate certain pathogens, such as A. phagocytophilum , or mouse immune systems may cease to produce antibodies despite patent infections. These new findings will help interpret prevalence of antibodies to tick-borne pathogens in white-footed mice. Bed bugs fungal pathogen treatments and reproductive studies: Drs. Gale E. Ridge, Kirby C. Stafford III , and Dr. Anuja Bhardwaj conducted several experiments on the use of entomopathogenic fungi as a control on the Common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L. More specifically, Metarhizium brunneum strain F52 was used and proven effective against C. lectularius in the laboratory. Dr. Ridge additionally ran a study on C. lectularius fecundity, reproductive strategies, and viability using two populations, a laboratory strain (the Harlan line) and a New Haven \"wild\" strain (the Ridge line). Results revealed here -to-fore unobserved behaviors and fecundity traits. There is great concern across the U.S. and around the world about annual heavy losses of honey bee colonies, the decrease in diversity of bumble bee species, and the more general decline of many other species of pollinators. Dr. Kimberly Stoner, with assistance from Tracy Zarrillo, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 119 Morgan Lowry, Krystian Madrid, Benjamin Gluck, Christine Bell, Meaghan Stucke, and Ghada Hafez, is studying s everal aspects of pollination, bee health, and diversity of bee species. Pollination of Pumpkins and Winter Squash: Pumpkins and winter squash ( Cucurbita spp.) require insect pollination in order to set fruit, and fruit size is also closely related to th e amount of pollen deposited on the female flowers. Dr. Stoner is beginning a 5- year project to evaluate pollination of pumpkins and winter squash on 20 farms in Connecticut. This collaborative project comprising research on pollination of four commodities in four states, is funded by the Specialty Crops Research Initiative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first year of the study begins with counts of bees on pumpkins and winter squash in farmers' fields and collection of stigmas to determine the level of pollen deposited. Many factors that could affect the health and abundance of pollinators are also being monitored: concentrations of pesticides in the nectar and pollen of the plants, presence or absence of a range of pathogens in the three bee species most important in pollination, and habitat and floral resources for the bees in the surrounding landscape. Sampling Alternative Floral Resources on Vegetable Farms: One of the factors that determines the abundance and diversity of wild bees in an area and the suitability for managed honey bee colonies is the availability of flowering plants to provide nectar and pollen over the season of bee activity. Dr. Stoner and her team observed and collected bees on 105 species at 10 private farms, including cut flowers, herbs, cover crops and weeds. This project is funded by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Her team is recording time of flowering, area, flower density, taking 5-minute counts of bees, and then taking 5-minute net collections of bees for identification to species. The total number of bees observed is the product of the bees observed per minute of observation, and the number of minutes - which depends partly on how many farms grew the plants and partly on how long the plants bloomed. The plants with the greatest total numbers of bees observed were sunflowers and lavender. Both of these had high numbers of bees observed per minute, were grown on multiple farms, and bloomed and attracted bees for 2-3 months. The plant with the greatest number of bees observed per minute was buckwheat with 39.5 bees per minute, followed by common motherwort with 33.7 and catnip with 31.7. Each of these plants were grown on only one of the private farms and bloomed only briefly, so we had only 1- 2 samples for each species. In addition, the same measurements were made on replicated field plots with 7 perennial and 7 annual species of herbs and cut flowers, and 5 species of cover crops. At Lockwood Farm, anise Summer assistants Ben Gluck and Christy Bell sweep marjoram for bees. 120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 hyssop had the greatest number of total bees observed and also the highest number of bees per minute. Following behind were basil and the annual sunflower 'Soraya.' Surveys for Invasive Insects : Dr. Maier, assisted by Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, continued to investigate the distribution of the brown marmorated stink bug ( Halyomorpha halys). This Asian stink bug has an exceptionally broad host range, with the adults and nymphs often feeding on the same host plants. New distributional records usually were obtained from citizens who found adults in their homes during the fall and winter months. In 2011 and 2012, this invasive stink bug was detected in many new locations throughout Connecticut. Currently, it is known from 60 towns distributed in the 8 counties of the state. Fortunately, it has not yet damaged agricultural crops in Connecticut. In August 2011, the non-native spotted wing drosophila ( Drosophila suzukii ) was found at several locations in Connecticut for the first time. This Asian vinegar fly poses a threat to agricultural crops, particularly small fruits. During the past few years, larvae of this fly have caused millions of dollars of damage in other states. Between September and December 2011, Dr. Maier and his assistants found it in 86 (51%) of 169 municipalities distributed throughout the 8 counties of Connecticut. New distributional records were based primarily on capturing adults in vinegar- baited traps and on rearing them from infested fruit. During the survey, adults of the spotted wing drosophila were reared from the infested fruits of wild plants of American pokeweed ( Phytolacca also was reared from the fruits of the cultivated plants hosts of the spotted wing drosophila may contribute to the buildup of populations that later injure agricultural crops. Lily Leaf Beetle : The lily leaf beetle ( Lilioceris lilii) is a highly destructive pest of Asiatic and Oriental lilies that are grown in many flower gardens in Connecticut. Both the larvae and adults of this European beetle feed upon the foliage and flowers of lilies, sometimes causing the death of plants. Although this invasive beetle seems to prefer Asiatic true lilies, it has spread into the wild where it now injures two native lilies \u2014the Canada lily ( Lilium and the Turk's- cap lily (L. superbum ). Based on the high abundance of these non-native beetles, they soon may pose a threat to our populations of native lil ies. In 2012, Dr. Maier and his assistants began a new project to determine the impact on the lily leaf beetle on wild lilies. They found immatures or adults of the lily leaf beetle in 75% of the wild lily populations examined in spring and early summer. Experiments in future years will focus on how different densities of beetles affect wild lilies and how many generations the beetles have. Improved Use of Lindgren Funnels : Dr. Maier and his assistants have concluded a 4- year USDA-funded project on how baited Lindgren funnels, traps that imitate the form and sometimes the odor of a tree trunk, can be modified to increase their efficiency in capturing adults of wood-boring insects and their natural enemies. In 2011, a final experiment was conducted in a broad-leaved forest in Meshomasic State Forest, East Hampton. In this experiment, the catches of beetles in collection cups with the killing agents of 70% ethyl alcohol, soapy water, propylene The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 121 glycol, and vapona were compared. Collection cups with alcohol caught the greatest number of longhorned, predatory checkered, and bark beetles. Based on all experiments conducted between 2008 and 2011, Dr. Maier has concluded that (1) the killing agent used in Lindgren funnels can affect trap catch, (2) increasi ng the lid size of funnels decreases the amount of water and debris in the collection cups, and (3) the lid size of traps generally does not influence catch of targeted wood -borers. Notably, the use of 70% ethyl alcohol, the killing agent, in collection c ups significantly increases the catch of many economically important beetles in spring. Although alcohol costs more than other killing agents, its use may be justified in detection programs for highly destructive beetles. A benefit of increased lid size, particularly with the use of killing agents such as ethanol and propylene glycol, is that specimen quality is higher. This occurs because the preservative killing agents do not become diluted by rain accumulating in collection cups. Larger lids, along with improved specimen quality, may even allow the interval between trap inspections to be increased. Longhorned Beetles of Connecticut : Dr. Maier and his assistants have continued to assess the fauna of longhorned beetles in the state. They have gathered biological information on both native and non- native wood-borers by capturing adults in traps, rearing adults from larvae in wood, collecting adults on flowers, and examining museum collections. They have recorded nearly 200 species of longhorns in Connecticut. In 2011 and 2012, they trapped previously had not been reported from Connecticut. To date, they have reared 82 species from dead wood collected in New England; many of the host associations are new to science. They have examined the period of adult activity of over 100 species. They have generated a database, which now has over 8,100 entries. Biological data stored in the database should assist in the development of management plans for borers that are or may become pests. Agrilus species - The genus Agrilus (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) contains several species of economic importance, both native and invasive. Dr. Rutledge is pursuing several lines of research with two members of this genus. The Bronze Birch Borer (BBB), Agrilus anxious Glory, a native insect, requires stressed, living trees to develop, and thus frequently attack birches in landscape and nursery settings. The beetles cause considerable aesthetic and financial damage to homeowners and nurserymen in Connecticut. The emerald ash b orer (EAB), A. planipennis Fairmaire, an invasive pest, is a native of Asia that was discovered in Detroit MI in 2002 and has spread widely. While not yet detected in Connecticut, an infestation was found in Rhiencliff NY on the approximately 25 miles from the CT border. In collaboration with Dr. Melody Keena USDA FS, Dr. Rutledge is pursuing a multi-pronged approach to studying the reproductive behavior o f BBB and EAB which encompasses mating behavior, mate choice, and the kinetics of sperm transfer and storage. A study of the impact of mating frequency on fecundity in EAB published this year showed that EAB females need to mate more than one time to ensure fecundity. A similar study with BBB, which has been accepted for publication, showed that BBB females can achieve full fecundity with just one mating. The results of this research are being used to improve laboratory rearing of EAB, as well as to understand the population dynamics of both species. Finally, surveys are ongoing on the natural enemies of BBB and other species in the Buprestidae. This work has two main goals, the first is to document current natural enemies in advance of the probable release of non -native parasitoid wasps for the control of EAB when it arrives in the state. The second is to search for potential natural enemies that could be used 122 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 against EAB here. One technique used in this survey is dissection of Cerceris fumipennis -caught buprestid beetles for pathogenic organisms and microsporidia. Another approach is girdling birch trees in a number of habitats throughout the state to make them more attractive to egg -laying BBB. The infested trees are then left in situ and the next fall the trees are collected and any larvae dissected out of the tree, collected and examined for parasitoids and pathogens. Cerceris fumipennis : Dr. Claire Rutledge with the assista nce of Mioara Scott has several studies on the buprestid hunter Cerceris fumipennis (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) underway. This native, solitary hunting wasp uses adult buprestid beetles to provision her nest for her larvae. The wasps nest in colonies of 1 - 500 holes and prefer hard-packed sandy soil. When colonies are located, it is easy to monitor the wasps returning to their holes and identify the beetles that they are carrying. In areas that are infested by EAB, the wasps will bring EAB adults to the nests. Thus, the wasp provides a highly efficient, effective and free 'bio -surveillance' system. With funding from the US Forest Service, we are surveying colonies throughout CT. Wasp Watcher Program : The wasp watcher program was begun in the spring of 2010. The program had several goals. The first was to increase our ability to monitor colonies of C. fumipennis for invasive buprestid beetles, in particular EAB. Secondly, we hoped to educate and involve citizens on the issues and science surrounding invas ive species in general and wood -boring insects in particular. In the summer of 2010, we had 23 watchers at 21 colonies. In the summer of 2011, many of the original watchers returned. We were also joined by volunteers at the White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield and the Bartlett Arboretum in Stamford. We concentrated on colonies with many nests, and 29 watchers monitored 21 colonies. In 2012, we were again joined by the White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield. We were also approved as an 'outreach activity' by the University of Connecticut Extension Master Gardeners Program. We had 17 Master Gardeners join the Wasp Watchers for a total of 55 volunteers. The colonies were distributed throughout CT. No invasive buprestid beetles were found in 2010 and 2011. We are still awaiting results from 2012. Two lines of research in addition to the 'bio-surveillance' efforts were continued this past year. The first project is in collaboration with Philip Careless, Dr. Melissa Fierke SUNY and Colleen Teerling, Maine Forest Service. With funding from the forest service, we are co llecting data to determine the degree-day requirements of C. fumipennis . This knowledge should help us to better use and manipulate C. fumipennis as a bio-surveillance tool. Captive wasp colonies can be used to provide 'surveillance services in areas where invasive buprestids are suspected in much the same way that honey bee colonies are used to provide pollination services in agriculture. The second regards the cues used by C. fumipennis to recognize their prey. This project is in collaboration with Dr. Pe ter Silk of the Canadian Forest Service and Philip Careless (Canada Food and Agriculture). We are hoping to identify the chemical signature of Buprestidae used by C. fumipennis to recognize their prey. Wasps will grasp, and attempt to paralyze Moiara Scott and Stone Ng collect beetles from female Cerceris wasps returning to their burrows at a ball field. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 123 buprestid be etles, but not beetles in other families. The attractive elements can be removed by washing the beetles with solvents, and then restored by applying the extract. So far, we have shown that the wasps accept washed beetles coated with an extract from several different species of Buprestidae, and reject washed beetles coated with non- buprestid beetle extracts. A synthesized A. planipennis contact sex pheromone was shown to be attractive to the wasp in summer 2011. However, merely adding buprestid extract to a non-host beetle did not make that beetle acceptable. A test of the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons of 10 species of Buprestidae showed that their hydrocarbon profile is relatively simple, including only 2 to 3 major classes of hydrocarbons, whereas o ther beetles tested include up to 8 or 9. We will test the hypothesis that it is the presence of hydrocarbons in classes that do not appear in Buprestidae that cause wasps to reject beetles that are not buprestids. NURSERY AND PLANT INSPECTION ACTIVITIES Plant inspection and regulatory services are coordinated and conducted by State Entomologist Dr. Kirby Stafford , Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Tia Blevins , Inspector Ira Kettle. NURSERY INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION . Three-hundred eleven nurseries were certified to conduct intra- and interstate business. There were 721 nursery inspections during the growing season. Seven -thousand, nine -hundred and twenty five acres of nursery stock were examined. NURSERY INSECTS . The most abundant pests found in nurseries (in order of prevalence) were aphids on various trees and shrubs, Rhododendron leaf miner, mites on various trees and shrubs, Boxwood blight, and thrips. JAPANESE BEETLE CERTIFICATION . We observed treatments of 1,500 plants at two nurseries and issued phytosanitary certificates to comply with states that quarantine nursery stock from Connecticut because of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica. Two nurseries met other requirements of the United States Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan and shipped 2,843 plants to states that quarantine plants from Connecticut. JAPANESE BEETLE CERTIFICATION TO CANADA. Eight Connecticut nurseries, which met the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 249,704 plants to Canada in 2011. NURSERY DEALER PERMITS . Nursery dealer permits were issued to 175 firms. One-hundred forty five of these companies operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each. In total, there were 565 outlets. PHYTOSANITARY CERTIFICATES . Three-hundred and forty six phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant materials to destinations outside the United States: Product Number Apples (Cartons) 10,000 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas)( # Bags) 107 Chinese tree peonies (plants) 65 Greenhouse plants 847 Nursery stock (containers - B & B) 247,708 Orchids (plants) 2,524 Perennials (bare root plants) 2,587 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 (plants) 500 Seeds (cartons & bags) 203 Tobacco (bales, boxes, bundles & cartons) 144,939 Walnut shells (bags and drums) 180 SPECIAL INSPECTIONS . Six inspections were made for 54 individual plants and bulbs to assist homeowners moving out of state. One-hundred eleven inspections were made to assist nurseries moving the following plants interstate: Product Number Perennials (plants) 1,500 Nursery stock (containers) 1,209 (bare root plants) 1,500 Greenhouse plants 1,391 Orchids 2,524 Seed (# Bags) 111 There was one Post -Entry Quarantine site approved in CT in 2011. BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULA TORY SERVICES INSPEC TION ACTIVITY . In cooperation with officers from the Wallingford USDA -APHIS-PPQ office, three inspections were conducted in 2011 at facilities or laboratories working with recombinant or regulated organisms. PERMITS TO MOVE LIVE PLANT PESTS, NOXIOUS WEEDS, AND SOIL . In 2011, there were fifty five PPQ 526 Permits (Permit to move live plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil) approved in CT. There were four PPQ 330 Permits (Permit to move soil) approved in CT. FOREST HEALTH . During the summer of 2011, we examined 51 permanent, one- acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest health in Connecticut. These plots are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long-term studies. We evaluated signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches, limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to reflect increasing damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their health. We will continue to use these plots to monitor the forests over several years to assess whether our state forests remain healthy or are declining. In general, our forests remain healthy. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. Single rain events in March contributed to a high spring rainfall level for most of CT in 2011, even though most of the year was abnormally dry. Rainfall in the late summer and fall exceeded normal levels. Hurricane Irene struck CT on August 27, 2011, first as a Category 1 storm, degenerating rapidly to a tropical storm. Many trees were toppled and many more sustained damage to branches and crowns, due to strong winds. Foliage w as tattered and damaged by salt spray, especially in coastal areas. In the days that followed, prolonged flooding occurred in areas along streams and rivers, especially along the Housatonic and Connecticut River watersheds. Beach erosion was common, especi ally in the East Haven area of New Haven County. The effects of this hurricane will be felt in years to come, as damage to trees from breakage and the effects of flooding will be reflected in increased tree mortality and susceptibility to diseases and inse ct pests. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 125 The Halloween Nor'easter occurred on October 29 and 30, 2011, causing extensive damage to trees and landscapes. Heavy snowfall on trees that had not yet shed leaves resulted in branches breaking under the weight, trees collapsing, and stress on trees that did not break. The northwestern counties of CT were most severely impacted, with many roads blocked by downed trees and power lines. At one point, over 80 % of electric utility customers in CT were without power, in some cases for as long as two weeks. Many of the trees that succumbed were probably weakened by Hurricane/TS Irene. Long -term consequences of these two storms will be seen in the forested areas for years to come. INSECT AND DISEASE SURVEYS GYPSY MOTH. There was no observable defoliation due to Gypsy Moth recorded in CT in 2011. During egg mass surveys in winter 2011- 2012, very few viable egg masses were found. In November and December 2011, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80-95% favorable host sites on a 7- mile grid ( 102 sites) throughout Connecticut. No viable egg masses were found. ASIAN LONGHORNED BEETLE. We conducted inspections of 38,081 trees in all counties of CT for presence or signs of ALB infestation. HEMLOCK WOOLLY ADELGID. During 2011, we required all hemlock nursery stock that was being shipped out of Connecticut to be treated for Hemlock woolly adelgid. Three nurseries shipped hemlock trees out of state. Our inspectors observed treatments and issued phytosanitary certificates to cover 2,109 plants in these shipments. RAMORUM LEAF BLIGHT . As part of the P. ramorum National Nursery Survey, we inspected 20 nurseries during 2011. During this survey so far, 93,864 plants have been inspected and 236 samples from symptomatic plants were submitted for lab analysis. All samples were cultured and tested by ELISA; DNA from ELISA -positive samples was sent to Beltsville for PCR confirmation. One hundred ninety-five samples, about 83 %, were ELISA-positive, indicating the presence of Phytophthora sp. All sampl es from the nurseries were negative for P. ramorum . An aquatic survey was done in conjunction with the US Forest Service. The stream selected for survey surrounds a 400-acre production nursery that has been implicated in P. ramorum trace-back activity. On e location upstream of the nursery and one location downstream were baited with rhododendron leaves during April through September 2011; the baiting period was about 2 weeks each month, with a hiatus during June and July when the water temperature exceeded 20 o C. Leaf baits were submitted for testing to labs at the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and at Cornell University. While many leaf baits were positive for Phytophthora species, all leaf baits were negative for P. ramorum . There was one trace -forward action involving P. ramorum in CT in 2011. Host material was shipped to ten residences, and associated host material to nine residences, from a retail nursery in Oregon. All were contacted by letter, and all residences receiving host material were visited by inspectors. Samples were taken from symptomatic plants, and one plant, a Rhododendron, was found positive for P. ramorum . The Residential Protocol was carried out with the cooperation of the homeowner, and the location will be inspected and monitored for two additional years, as per protocol. 126 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 DAYLILY RUST . Daylily rust, caused by Puccinia hemerocallidis, was found on daylilies in a southeastern U.S. nursery for the first time in the summer of 2000, and in 2001 and 2002 on daylilies owned by private citizens. It is now confirmed to occur in three counties. During 2011, we surveyed daylilies in nurseries and garden centers for signs of this rust. Forty- two inspections (20,896 plants) were carried out; no signs of Puccinia hem erocallidis were found. CHRYSANTHEMUM WHITE RUST . In 2011, we inspected 121,943 plants for CWR. One private citizen reported CWR in his personal garden; the plants had been planted over 10 years ago. The plants were dug up, bagged in plastic trash bags, and disposed of in the municipal waste stream. Ins pection of properties within 400 meters revealed no nearby sources of inoculum. One chrysanthemum grower discovered CWR in his production area, and mitigated the infestation without regulatory interference. Approximately 20,000 plants were bagged and pla ced in dumpsters. Inspection of the surrounding environment and the remainder of his property revealed no further infestation. The area was treated with disinfectants after plant disposal. BOXWOOD BLIGHT . In November 2011, boxwood blight, caused by the fungus Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum , was discovered at a residence in Middlesex County CT. This disease is new to CT and to the US. Trace- back activity was initiated, and infected plants at the property were destroyed. To date, four residences, two wholesale nurseries, and seven retail locations have been confirmed to have boxwood blight. Disposal of affected plants is ongoing; to date, approximately 100,000 plants have been destroyed by burial or dumpster. FOREST HEALTH SURVEY . During the summer and autumn of 2011, we examined 51 permanent, one-acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest health in Connecticut. These plots are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long-term studies. We evaluated signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches, limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations a re designed to reflect increasing damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their health. We will continue to use these plots to monitor the forests over several years to assess whethe r our state forests remain healthy or are declining. In general, our forests remain healthy. Plots containing a significant ash ( Fraxinus sp .) component will be sites for trapping for emerald ash borer (Agrilus paniplennis ), an invasive insect that was detected in July 2010 in Saugerties, NY. HEMLOCK WOOLLY ADELGID. This pest has been present in CT for many years, and continues to cause patchy damage and decline among the remaining population of hemlocks. In 2011, a total of 35.6 acres in Fairfield County, 3,172.1 acres in Hartford County, 2,358.0 acres in Litchfield County, 120.2 acres in New Haven County, 247.1 acres in New London County, 251.0 acres in Tolland County, and 18.2 acres in Windham County were affected by HWA. Statewide, 6,202.2 acres were af fected by HWA. In fact, many areas of hemlock are healthy, especially in the northwest corner of the state; in many areas hemlocks are recovering due to wet summers and reduction in HWA populations, especially where biocontrol was implemented. There were no further hemlock or HWA mortality assessments in Connecticut for 2011 due to elimination of federal funding for this work. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 127 EMERALD ASH BORER . We found no emerald ash borers, or any symptoms of them in our survey. However, we did find that overall the health of ash trees in the state is poor, with only 35% of trees examined classified as healthy by the observers. Thus, it seems likely that Connecticut's ash population will be highly vulnerable to the borer when it does arrive. HARDWOOD ANTHRACNOSE . Anthracnose diseases of hardwood trees may be caused by several different genera of fungi; for purposes of mapping, any severe discoloration and defoliation of hardwoods is considered to be anthracnose. These diseases are favored by cool wet conditions, similar to those experienced in spring and early summer of 2011. Damage to trees from anthracnose diseases was widespread and general across the state; all forested areas were somewhat affected. ORANGE -STRIPED OAKWORM . The Orange -striped oakworm, Anisota senator ia, is a native moth that ranges from eastern Canada southward to Georgia. It is a common pest of oak species in Connecticut. Occasionally, local infestations occur when oaks have been stressed by other factors such as drought or gypsy moths. Serious defoliation can occur when this happens. The moths lay up to 500 eggs on the undersides of an oak leaves in early summer and are attracted to artificial light. The caterpillars feed on the foliage, and then they burrow into the soil and build an earthen cell, where it pupates and passes the winter. In 2011, 546.1 acres in Fairfield County, 547.7 acres in New London County, and 251.1 acres in Windham County, for a total of 1,344.9 acres statewide were affected by orange-striped oakworm. RED PINE SCALE. Red pine scale, Matsucoccus gallicolus , was described in CT in the 1940's, and causes sporadic damage. In Hartford County, 27.1 acres were affected; in Litchfield County, 5.1 acres were affected, and in Tolland County, 59.5 acres were affected by red pine scale, for a total of 91.7 acres statewide. APIARY CERTIFICATION Nine Hundred and Fifty-five beekeepers registered 5,443 colonies in 2011-2012. Our bee inspectors opened and inspected 561 colonies. One case of American foulbrood was detected. Apis ceranae was detected in many areas and is an increasing problem. Varroa mite is generally distributed in almost all beehives across the state. A new apiary inspector, Mark H. Creighton joined the Station on May 18, 2012. Apiary inspector Ira Kettle (pictured at right at the 2011 Hartford Flower and Garden Show) passed away in December 2011 after nearly 19 years of service to Connecticut's beekeepers. He will be missed. 128 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Pest/disease Positives Small Hive Beetle 7 American Foulbrood 1 Chalkbrood 7 Die-offs 150 Sacbrood 2 Nosema 7 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 129 DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program Mosquito surveillance for West Nile (WN) virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is integral to the public health response to these mosquito- transmitted viruses in Connecticut. The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, identity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) information that is used to assess the threat of WN virus and EEE to the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. The program is conducted by Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Philip Armstrong , assisted by John Shepard, Michael Thomas , and Shannon Finan. Mosquito trapping is conducted at 91 permanent trapping stations that are located in 72 municipalities throughout the state. In 2011, mosquito trapping was conducted from May 31 to October 20. Traps were set and attended by CAES staff every 10 days at each site on a regular rotation. Two trap types were used at all trapping stations - a CO2-baited CDC Light Trap, designed to trap host -seeking adult female mosquitoes (all species), and a Gravid Mosquito Trap, designed to trap previously blood- fed adult female mosquitoes (principally Culex and container breeding Ochlerotatus species). Mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning where they were identified to species. Mosquitoes were grouped (pooled) according to species, collecting site, and date and frozen at -80 oC. A maximum of 50 female mosquitoes were included in each p ool. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of WN virus and other mosquito- borne arboviruses of public health importance. Virus isolates from mo squito pools were tested for WN, EEE, Jamestown Canyon (JC), Cac he Valley (CV), Trivittatus (TVT), Highlands J (HJ), and LaCrosse (LAC), and Potosi (POT) viruses. Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or standard RT -PCR using virus -specific primers. All of the virus is olation work was conducted in a certified Bio -Safety Level 3 laboratory at the CAES. Weekly test results were reported to the CDC electronically via ArboNet and to the DPH for dissemination to other state agencies, local health departments, the media, and neighboring states. For the 2011 season, a record total of 334,371 mosquitoes (19,283 pools) representing 37 species were trapped and tested. A total of 166 isolations of WN virus were made from 7 mosquito species: pipiens = 117, Aedes cinereus = 1, Ochlerotatus canadensis = 1 collected at 46 sites in 37 towns in 7 counties: Fairfield ( Bridgeport , Danbury, Darien, Easton, Fairfield, Greenwich, New Canaan, Norwalk , Shelton, Stamford, Stratford, Trumbull, Westport), Hartford (Hartford, Glastonbury, New Britain, South Windsor ), Litchfield (Litchfield), Middlesex 130 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 (Cromwell, Westbrook), New Haven (Branford, East Haven, Hamden, Meriden, Milford, New Haven, North Branford, North Haven, Orange , West Haven, Woodbridge), and New London (Groton, Ledyard, North Stonington, Waterford), and Tolland (Tolland, Willington) (Figure 1) . The first positive mosq uitoes were collected on June 21, and the last on October 17. As in prior years, the majority of WN virus activity was detected in densely populated urban and suburban regions in southwestern (Fairfield and New Haven Counties) Connecticut. Nine locally acquired human cases of WN virus infection were reported to CTDPH from residents living in Bridgeport (2 cases), New Haven (2 cases), Greenwich, New Fairfield, Southington, Stamford (2 cases) . One equine case was reported from Suffield. Very little EEE virus activity was detected in 2011. A total of 4 isolations of EEE virus were made from Culiseta melanura (n=3) and Ochlerotatus canadensis (n=1) mosquitoes collected in North Plainfield and Stonington from September 15 to October 12. There were no human or horse cases of EEE reported. Other mosquito- borne viruses isolated included: Cache Valley (CV) 43 isolations from 12 species; Highlands J (HJ) = 21 isolations from 3 species (August 25 - October 24); Jamestown Canyon (JC) = 64 isolations from 11 species (June 1 - June 20); Potosi (POT) = 2 isolations from 2 species; Trivittatus (TVT) = 9 isolates from 1 species The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 131 Mosquito species trapped and tested for arboviruses in Connecticut, 2011 Mosquito Species # Mosquitoes # Pools Virus CV EEE HJ JC POT crucians 42 27 An. punctipennis 4,338 833 9 5 1 An. quadrimaculatus 950 An. walker 4,603 3 17 7 Cs. minnesotae 132 31 Cs. morsitans 107 54 Ochlerotatus 1 1 Oc. cantator 5,465 383 1 10 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Oc. communis 162 15 505 TOTAL S 334,371 19,283 43 4 21 53 2 9 166 CV = Cache Valley, HJ = Highlands J, JC = Jamestown Canyon, POT = Potosi, TVT = Trivittatus, WN = West Nile Impact. Mosquitoes were collected at 91 trap sites, located in 72 municipalities, in Connecticut. Following identification, the insects were processed for virus isolations and identified using molecular methods to analyze RNA. During 2011, 334,371 mosquitoes were tested for virus. There were 166 isolations of WN virus 4 isolations of EE E. There were 9 locally acquired human cases in the state linked to WN virus infection. News releases included information on how residents could protect themselves from mosquito bites, such as the use of repellents. The information contained in the new s releases had an immediate impact because many residents did take the suggested precautions. The long -term benefits include a healthy human population and a well-informed public concerning the potential risks of mosquito bites. Participation in the statewide surveillance program provided timely information about levels of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 133 virus activity in the mosquito population which was used to assess risk of human infection, inform the public and health care providers of these risks, guide vector control efforts, and prevent disease outbreaks. Studies on Mosquitoes and Eastern Equine Encephalitis Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) is a highly pathogenic mosquito-borne zoonosis that is responsible for outbreaks of severe disease in humans and equines, resulting in high mortality or severe neurological impairment in mos t survivors. In the northeastern U.S., EEE virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving the ornithophilic mosquito, Culiseta melanura and passerine birds in freshwater swamp habitats. To evaluate the role of Cs. melanura and Culiseta morsitans in recent episodes of EEE virus activity in Massachusetts, Drs. Goudarz Molaei, Theodore Andreadis, Philip Armstrong and Mr. Michael Thomas in collaboration with researchers from several Massachusetts Mosquito Control Projects (Central, Northeast, Bristol and Plymouth Counties) and the Massachusetts Department of Health collected blood- fed mosquitoes between June 2007 and October 2008 from virus foci in six counties, and identified the source of blood meals by PCR amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and sequencing. Analysis of 529 Cs. melanura and 25 Cs. morsitans revealed that nearly 99% and 96% of mosquitoes, respectively, acquired blood meals solely from avian hosts. American Robin, Turdus migratorius was identified as the most common vertebrat e host for Cs. melanura (21.7%, n = 115), = 30); and other mostly Passeriformes birds. Mammalian -derived blood meals were identified as white- tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus ; domestic cow, Bos taurus ; and human, Homo sapiens . There w ere four isolations of EEE, West Nile and Highland J viruses from Cs. melanura. Impact. Our results in conjunction with other lines of evidence including reservoir competency, prevalence of antibody and infection in nature suggest that American Robin, Tuf ted Titmouse, Black - capped Chickadee and a few other passerine birds may play key roles in supporting EEE virus transmission in Massachusetts. Infrequent blood- feeding of Cs. melanura on mammalian hosts, including humans, also indicates that this mosquito may occasionally contribute to epidemic/epizootic transmission of EEE virus in this region. Disease outbreaks caused by EEE virus may be prevented by implementing effective surveillance and intervention strategies directed against the mosquito vector. Methods for EEE virus detection in mosquitoes include a real -time reverse transcriptase PCR technique (TaqMan assay), but Drs. Philip Armstrong and Theodore Andreadis reported its failure to detect variants isolated in Connecticut in 2011 due to a single base -pair mismatch in the 134 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 probe-binding site. To improve the molecular detection of EEE virus, they developed a multi -target TaqMan assay in collaboration with Ms. Nicholanna Prince from the Connecticut Department of Public Health by adding a second primer/probe set to provide redundant targets for EEE virus detection. The multi-target TaqMan assay had similar performance characteristics to the conventional assay but also detected newly evolving strains of EEE virus. The approach increases the reliability of TaqMan assay by creating backup targets for virus detection without sacrificing sensitivity or specificity. Studies on Mosquitoes and West Nile Virus Seasonal epizootics of vector-borne pathogens infecting multiple species are ecologically complex and difficult to forecast. Pathogen transmission potential within the host community is determined by the relative abilities of host species to maintain and transmit the pathogen and by ecological factors influencing contact rates between hosts and vectors. Increasing evidence of strong feeding preferences by a number of vectors suggests that the host community experienced by the pathogen may be very different from the local host community. Scientists from Yale University in collaboration with Drs. Goudarz Molaei, and Theodore Andreadis developed an empirically informed transmission model for West Nile virus (WNV) in four sites using one vector species (Culex pipiens) and preferred and non- preferred avian hosts. They measured strong feeding preferences for American robins ( Turdus migratorius ) by proportion of Cx. pipiens blood meals from robins in relation to their abundance (feeding index). The model accurately predicted WNV prevalence in Cx. pipiens at three of four sites. Sensitivity analysis revealed feeding preference was the most influential parameter on intensity and timing of peak WNV infection in Cx. pipiens and a threshold feeding index for transmission was identified. Findings indicate host preference- induced contact heterogeneity is a key mediator of vector -borne pathogen epizootics in multi -species host communities, and should be The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 135 incorporated into multi-host transmission models. Studies in Biological C ontrol of Mosquitoes Drs. Theodore Andreadis and Charles Vossbrinck in collaboration with scientists from Tomsk State University and Institute of Systematic and Ecology of Animals, in Russia conducted a survey of mosqu ito larvae infected with microsporidia from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from 9 species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia ); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) 6 species Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in dist inguishing taxonomic relationships . SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yield ed similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito- parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host -parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host -parasite co -speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the \"normal\" host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system. Studies on the Mosquito Culex pipiens Scientists from Michigan State and the University of Wisconsin in collaboration with Dr. Theodore Andreadis and former Postdoctoral Scientist, Dr. Shoaming Huang analyzed the molecular genetic diversity in nine marker regions of five genes within the bacteriophage WO region of the Wolbachia pipentis strain wPip genome from a population of Culex pipiens sampled in metropolitan Chicago, Illinois. From 166 blood fed females, 50 distinct genetic profiles of wPip were identified. Rarefaction analysis suggested a maximum of 110 profiles out of a possible 512 predicted by combinations of the nine markers. A rank -abundance curve showed that few strains were common and most were rare. Multiple regression showed that markers associated with gene 136 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Gp2d, encoding a partial putative capsid protein, were significantly associated with ancestry of individuals to form molestus or form pipiens, as determined by prior microsatellite allele frequency analysis. None of the other eight markers was associated with ancestry to either form nor to ancestry to Cx. quinquefasciatus . Logistic regression of host choice (mammal vs. avian) as revealed by previous blood meal analysis revealed that significantly fewer individuals that had fed on mammals had the Gp9a genetic marker (58.5%) compared to avian- fed individuals (88.1%). These data suggest that certain wPip molecular genetic types are associated with genetic substructuring in the Cx. pipiens complex of metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, and that the association extends to phenotypic variation related to host preference. Studies on Insects of Economic Importance Severe losses are seen world -wide in the silk industry due to insect pathogens. Dr. Charles Vossbrinck has been working with members of the sericulture institute in Chongqing China to understand the source of P\u00e9brine disease of the silk moth, Bombyx mori . A primitive, microscopic, protozoan- like organism, Nosema bombycis , is the causative agent of a disease that results in millions of dollars of losses in China. Population analysis is showing us that there are several sources of this disease and that the disease is incubating in other moth species in the environment and then infecting this highly domesticated insect. With further analysis we hope that the transmission of this disease to the silk moth can be better understood and that additional preventative measure can be taken. Nosema bombycis is a close relative of Nosema ceranae, thought to be involved in sudden hive collapse in honey bees in the United States and , therefore, another parasite of a domesticated insect causing millions of dollars in agricultural losses each year. Invasive Aquatic Plant Program Surveillance and Monitoring Program We are quantifying the locations of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds, determining their effects on native plant communities, establishing baseline data to track their spread and providing information that is critical for developing control strategies. In 2011, Greg Bugbee, Mark June -Wells and Jordan Gibbons mapped native and invasive aquatic vegetation in 15 new and nine previously surveyed water bodies. We now have complete aquatic vegetation surveys of 185 Connecticut lakes and ponds. To begin to di scern how invasive plants are affecting plant community's overtime, we resurveyed six lakes that we did at least five years ago. In addition, Lake Candlewood, Connecticut's largest lake, was surveyed for the fifth consecutive year to determine the effects of alternate year deep and shallow winter drawdown on crispus ). Lake Lillinonah, Connecticut's third largest lake, was surveyed for the second time to track changes in the population of invasive species. We established transects in each water body, using global positioning systems to quantify changes in native and invasive aquatic species abundance and distribution. We The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 137 Brazilian waterweed collected water samples from all water bodies and analyzed them for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, clarity, alkalinity, co nductivity and phosphorus. These da ta, along with watershed information, are being used to investigate the factors that influence the susceptibility of water bodies to certain invasive species. We archive dry specimens of all plant species in the CAES herbarium for future reference. We designed our Invasive Aquatic Plant Program to utilize the latest digital technology to rapidly and comprehensively report our findings to the public. Lake survey maps and other data are published online within days of their completion ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ) More than 60 percent of the surveyed water bodies contain one or more invasive plant species and some lakes contained as many as four invasive species. The most common invasive plants are Eurasian watermilfoil , Variable water 2009 survey of Fence Rock Lake discovered Connecticut's first infestation of Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa ) and our resurveys in 2010 and 2011 found the population expanding (Figure 2). Our 2011 resurvey of Lake Lillinonah found a pioneer infestation of water chestnut (Figure 3) . This plant produces reproduct ive \"nutlike\" structures that have sharp spikes capable of piecing bare feet. A hand removal program is in place for 2012. We are working with the local lake association and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) to provide control options. Figure 2. Yearly progression of Brazilian waterweed in Fence Rock Lake, Guilford 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Figure 3. Locations of water chestnut found by CAES IAPP in Lake Lillinonah Impact. Our surveys provide one of the most complete aquatic plant and water chemistry databases available. Using water chemistry and plant presence/absence data from 92 Connecticut lakes with invasive species, allowed us to developed risk assessment ranges for use by local resource managers and policy makers. Our multivariate statistical approach elucidated strong correlations among our five most abundant non- native aquatic plant species and the lake water chemistry. This approach allowed us to group lakes by species presence. We foun d invasive aquatic plants occurred in two distinct groups: 1) fanwort and variable watermilfoil and 2) curly leaf pondweed, minor naiad, and Eurasian watermilfoil. We then compared whether th e occurrence of each group was based on water chemistry. Our analysis detected highly significant differences among groups. The fanwort and variable watermilfoil group preferred lakes with lower conductivity, alkalinity, and pH than the curly leaf pondweed, minor naiad, and Eurasian watermilfoil group. Finally, we de veloped a mathematical model based on lake water chemistry that can predict which lakes will contain the five invasive species with nearly 80 percent accuracy . To prevent the spread of invasive species, Connecticut has enacted laws banning the sale and transport of 20 invasive aquatic plants. CAES IAPP evaluated aquarium retailer compliance with these laws . In 2008 and 2010, we visited 75 aquarium aquatic plant dealers. We purchased plants that looked like a banned species and brought them back to the lab for positive identification. Because we could not conclusively identify many specimens, we obtained their genetic sequences and compared them to known sequences in the GENBANK NCBI database. We found that 30% of the stores were selling banned aquatic species and that fanwort was the most common banned species being sold (Table 1). Moreover, Brazilian waterweed and various watermilfoil species were mislabeled by the retailer more than 50% of the time . We believe that this noncompliance to State law is primarily due to difficulties in identifying aquatic plant species and ignorance of state statutes . In 2011, CAES IAPP followed up and revisited the 75 retailers and provided information on state laws, copies of the CAES IAPP Invasive Aquatic Plant Identification Guide and offered education seminars. In addition, our work has provided The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 139 Figure 4. Response of Curly leaf pondweed (left) and Eurasian watermilfoil (right) to Diquat in Crystal Lake. valuable information to the CT D epartment of Agriculture and the CT Department of Energy andEnvironmental Protection, who are charged with inspecting aquarium retailers and enforcing the State laws. Control efforts . The goal of this objective is 1) to investigate novel means of chemical control that minimize s herbicide usage and protect native vegetation and 2) find biological organisms that will provide long-term suppression of invasive species. Herbicides - Novel methods of chemical control with herbicides can rapidly remove invasive plants and begin to restore native plant communities to aquatic ecosystems. Bashan Lake - East Haddam, CT - We are in the 12th year of research involving the use of spot applications of the herbicide 2, 4- D to control variable milfoil in Bashan Lake. We have largely restored the lake to preinfestation conditions; however, regrowth requires yearly surveys and modest retreatments. We have shown the effectiveness of late summer herbicide applications thus limiting the exposure of those who use the lake to the herbicide. We have integrated underwater video equipment with GPS and geographic information system (GIS) technology to precisely locate and treat the patches of variable watermilfoil. Crystal Lake- Middletown, CT . Crystal Lake has extensive growth of curly leaf pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil. From 2006-2011, we tested the effectiveness of single year and consecutive year applications of the applications of the herbicide diquat dibromide. Because of the presence of the State threatened plant species Vasey's pondweed (Potamogeton vaseyi), certain areas of the l ake needed to be protected with limnobarriers.

Effects of grass carp on the abundance and frequency of curly leaf pondweed in Grannis Lake . treatment with diquat dibromide was applied. After several weeks, the unwanted vegetation was controlled. By late summer, re-growth of curly leaf pondweed had begun but Eurasian m ilfoil did not return. This trend continued in the non -treatment year of 2008 with re -growth of the curly leaf pondweed to pretreatment levels but no re-growth of the Eurasian watermilfoil (Figure 4). This near complete elimination of Eurasian watermilfoil by the April diquat treatment may be a new tool for controlling this plant but further study is needed. In 2008, a survey for Vasey's pondweed by CT DEEP found that the plant was growing well. Eight species of native plants were found the year after treat ment compared to only four the year prior to treatment. This resurgence in native species suggests that the early season application of diquat, and associated reduction in invasive species pressure, may be beneficial to the plant community. Longer term con trol of the curly leaf pondweed requires reducing its bank of reproductive structures in the sediment called turions through treatments in consecutive years. We made early season diquat applications in 2009 and 2010 to test this theory. Again, limnobarrier s were installed and plant populations were monitored. Two consecutive years of Diquat treatment in 2009 and 2010 provide better control of curly leaf pondweed one year later (2011) than only one year treatment in 2007. Unfortunately, a substantial amount of curly leaf pondweed remained and rapid reinfestation to pretreatment levels can be expected in coming years. This research suggests that curly leaf pondweed is a very tenacious plant and reducing its population to acceptable levels for more than one year will require more than two consecutive years of treatment. Biological control - Our biological control program has now been in progress for four years. This year's efforts followed two lines of investigation. Grannis Lake - East Haven, CT . 2011 was our seventh year of study at Grannis Lake, East Haven which has problems with Eurasian water milfoil , curly leaf pondweed and minor naiad. After many years of unsuccessful attempts to control the invasive species with herbicides, we introduced plant -eating fish called grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella ) in 2007. A total of 200 sterile (triploid) fish averaging 25 cm (10 inch) in length were introduced into the 20-acre lake. We monitored more than 200 georeferenced sites in the lake to determine the effects of the grass carp on both native and invasive plant species. After no decrease in vegetation in 2008 and 2009, our survey in May 2010 finally showe d the fish were reducing the abundance (mass per point) of the invasive species (Figure 5). Interestingly, the frequency of occurrence has not yet been reduced and suggesting that the fish are consuming the suspended vegetation without any appreciable red uction in basal plant parts. In 2011, the abundance of curly leaf pond weed and other invasive species began to rise again probably due to the aging and natural mortality The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 141 of the grass carp population. We expect to restock Grannis Lake, in 2012, in conform ance with CT DEEP guidelines. Candlewood Lake - Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Sherman, CT. We have continued research on lfoil in other states and is native in Connecticut. Unfortunately, weevil populations in CT are rarely high enough to cause a significant reduction in milfoil. Our research, in collaboration with Western Connecticut State University (WSCU), the Candlewood Lake Authority and EnviroScience, Inc., is determining if augmenting milfoil weevil populations might lead to suppression of Eurasian watermilfoil. Although Candlewood Lake contains over 350 watermilfoil, milfoil weevils are nearly nonexi stent. In June 2010, 5,000 weevils were stocked into site F (Figure 6) and 11,000 weevils were stocked in site G. Site F had received a preliminary weevil introduction in 2008. In June 2011, 9,000 weevils were restocked into site G. W eevils and damage were monitored in the sites each August. We found no evidence the weevil populations are increasing but realize this may take many years. 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Outreach . We strive to disseminate all information from our program to the public in a timely fashion and educate stakeholders in the identification, prevention and management of invasive aquatic species. Given the magnitude of invasion by non- native aquatic plants, we are making significant efforts to engage citizens, lake associations, and other stakeholders. CAES scientists have organized several workshops on the identification of invasive aquatic plants. We have assembled numerous publications that are freely available in hard or electronic copy via our website ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Included are all our digitized interactive lake maps and our complete herbarium. We also gave presentations to professional organizations such as the Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Soci ety (NEAPMS), the Connecticut Conference on Natural Resources (CCNR), the New England Chapter of the North American Lake Management Society (NEC -NALMS), North American Lake Management Society (NALMS), the Northeast Arc User Group (NEARC) and students groups such as the Connecticut Envirothon.

DNA sequencing by Dr. Charles Vossbrinck and Kittipath Prapayotin- Riveros gives researchers a much more detailed view of aquatic plant life. As a result , we were able to see that a separate form of the invasive Cabomba caroliniana (Fanwort) is indeed a separate source of invasion in Connecticut and is the predominant form in Billings Lake, Connecticut. A phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequence data shows these samples to be different genetically and unlike the isolates generally found in the Eastern US. Being able to see life forms using \"molecular glasses\" allows us to follow changes in our environment that are hard to imagine until we see these detailed results. Dynamic interactions of natural organic matter and organic compounds. Due to the importance of natural organic matter (NOM) to the fate of organic compounds, their adsorptive interactions with NOM have been studied extensively over the past few decades. Quantitative relationships have been probed between the intensity of sorption and both the molecular structure of the sorbate and the bulk physical-chemical properties of the sorbent. However, studies addressing the molecular - level nature of sorptive interactions of organic compounds with NOM have been far fewer in number due to the intrinsic difficulties of detecting and sorting out the interactions in such a heterogeneous material. Historically, NOM has been regarded as a passive sorbent, accepting molecules from the liquid and gaseous phases without undergoing change. So far, little attention has been paid to the + +sorption in holes (cavity pre -exists)sorption in the dissolution domain (cavity required)++ ++sorption in holes (cavity pre -exists)sorption in the dissolution domain (cavity required) Depiction of glassy and rubbery states showing the holes in the glassy phase and depiction of sorption in the dissolution domain, where a cavity has to open up, and sorption in the hole domain where the cavity preexists . 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 matrix dynamics of the solid phase during sorption. Dr. Joseph Pignatello has shown that sorption is a dynamic process, both for the sorbing compound, which transfers from the fluid state to a solid state, and for the sorbent itself, which undergoes physical changes upon sorption. In this sense, sorbate and so rbent co-evolve during the process of sorption. NOM can be regarded as a polymer -like phase that responds to the input of organic compounds in ways analogous to synthetic polymers. Sorption selectivity of organic compounds is shown to result in part from t he three-dimensional microstructure of NOM related to its glassy character. Sorption to NOM conforms to polymer theory by exhibiting isotherm shape and irreversible behaviors characteristic of the glassy organic physical state. The glassy state is a metastable state characterized by the presence of excess free volume (holes). In polymers and NOM, incoming molecules preferentially occupy holes due to the absence of a cavitation penalty. Incoming molecules can enlarge existing holes and create new holes. The physical changes in NOM induced by sorption result in hysteresis in the isotherm that persists indefinitely at ambient temperature. Sorption selectivity and hysteresis have important implications for the fate and bioavailability of contaminants.

The solid swells and then shrinks as the sorbate enters and then leaves the solid. The dashed line indicates the dimensio ns of the volume element o f the original solid. The component of the sorption free energy that is invested in swelling expansion is not fully recovered upon desorption. The swelling -shrinking process would be fully reversible if the solid was initially r ubbery. Advanced Solid- state NMR Characterization of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter Isolated Using the Coupled Reverse Osmosis/Electrodialysis Method The marine organic carbon pool is one of the largest dynamic reservoirs of organic carbon on earth, comparable in size to that of atmospheric carbon. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) comprises most of marine organic carbon.

Progress in the understanding of the chemical structures of DOM has been impeded by (1) the lack of a suitable method for its isolation, and (2) its intrinsic chemical complexity. The recently -developed coupled reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) method shows great promise as a solution to the problem of representativeness because this method can collect 70 -85% of total dissolved organic carbon from seawater. Advanced 13C solid-state techniques were employed to investigate the major structural characteristics of two surface- seawater dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples isolated using the novel RO/ED method. The NMR techniques included quantitative 13C direct polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS). The two samples (Coastal and Marine DOM) were collected at the mouth of the Ogeechee River and in the Gulf Stream, respectively. The NMR resu lts indicated that they were structurally distinct. Coastal DOM contained significantly more aromatic and carbonyl carbons , whereas Marine DOM was markedly enriched in alkoxy carbon (e.g., carbohydrate- like moieties). Both samples contained significant amide N, but Coastal DOM had nitrogen bonded to aromatic carbons. Our dipolar -dephased spectra indicated that a large fraction of alkoxy carbons were not protonated. The major structural units of Coastal DOM were carbohydrate- like moieties, residues of ligni n and peptides; those of Marine DOM were primarily carbohydrate- like moieties and peptides. In addition, both samples contained significant amounts of nonpolar alkyl groups. The potential sources of the major structural units of DOM were discussed in detai l. Sorbic acid as a quantitative probe for the formation, scavenging and steady- state concentrations of the triplet-excited state of organic compounds Dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) in both fresh and saline waters acts as a photosensitizer for sunlight-driven photochemical reactions of chemical contaminants, as well NOM itself. Photon absorption by a photosensitizer produces an excited singlet state (S 1) that can relax to the ground state or undergo intersystem crossing (isc) to an excited triplet state (T 1). The T 1 state can relax to the ground state, undergo reaction with other molecules, or generate secondary photo- oxidants\u2014typically, reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical or singlet oxygen\u2014that may subsequently react with other molecules. Methods that can determine T 1 steady-state concentrations and reaction rate constants with organic compounds are unavailable. In this study, sorbic acid (trans,trans -hexadienoic acid) was developed as a probe for the quantification of the formation rate, overall solution scavenging rate and steady -state concentrations of T 1 states of organic compounds. The method was validated against literature data for the quenching rate constant of triplet benzophenone by tyrosine obtained by laser flash photolysis and by Stern-Volmer plots of phosphorescence quenching. In contrast to these methods, the sorbic acid probe Products of interaction between triplet -excited state organic photosensitizer and sorbic acid 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 method does not require knowledge of the opt ical properties of T 1 states to monitor their quenching. Moreover, it permits simultaneous quantification of triplet formation, quenching and steady- state concentrations during illumination of complex chromophore mixtures, such as NOM, with polychromatic light above 315 nm. Application of the method to de -aerated Suwannee River NOM illuminated with polychromatic light (315-430 nm) resulted in a triplet quantum yield of 0.062. Preparation and Characterization of Humic Acid Cross- linked with Organic Bridging Groups Cross-links are bonds that connect strands of different molecules in a macromolecular or supramolecular solid. Cross-linking is believed to play a role in the humification of soil/sediment organic matter (SOM) and the diagenesis of organic geopolymers. Experience with synthetic polymers shows that cross- linking increases molecular weight, creates network structures, reduces solubility, inhibits biodegradation, increases matrix rigidity, decreases free volume, and influences the sorbent properties of the solid towards organic. Such changes may be important to the ecological function of humic substances, yet the role of crosslinking in these substances has been poorly investigated. Model cross-linked humic substances were prepared by cross -linking Amherst soil humic acid by a diepoxide and a polycarboxylic acid, applying procedures established for cross- linking of polymers and textile fabrics. Products of the cross -linking reactions were analyzed by FTIR and 13C CPMAS NMR. Physicochemical properties of the products were determined by solubility experiments and thermal analysis. The incorporation of the cross - linker into the matrix of the humic acid by covalent linkages was confirmed by both the disappearance of bands of the reactive functional groups of the cross -linker in the FTIR spectrum and the increase of signals related to the incorporation of the cross- linker into the matrix of the humic acid in the FTIR and 13C-CPMAS- NMR spectra. The formation of covalent ester and ether linkages by the cross- linking reaction was indicated. Water solubilities at pH 6.2 of the cross -linked samples as determined by UV/Vis spectrometry were reduced compared to controls. Fewer water molecule bridges were formed in the cross- linked samples, which was attributed to a lower number of available functional groups and increased distances between humic acid strands caused by the cross -linking molecules. Reduced reactivities of humic acid strands in the cross -linked samples further ind icated successful cross- linking. The reactions investigated in this study can be regarded as models for reactions occurring in natural soils to test the significance of cross-linking reactions in the humification process of soil organic matter and the phys ic-chemical properties and ecological function of organic matter in geosolids .

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 147 Speciation of the Ionizable Antibiotic Sulfamethazine on Black Carbon (Biochar) Sulfonamide antibiotics are widely used in veterinary medicine to promote growth and control infectious diseases. Since they are poorly metabolized, a large fraction is deposited onto soils from grazing and manure application. At field concentrations, antibiotics impact soil microbial communities and functions, and may contribute to the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. Sorption is a critical process controlling the mobility and bioavailability of sulfonamide antibiotics in soil. The subject of our report is sulfamethazine (SMT; 4 -amino-N-[4,6-dimethyl-2- pyrimidinyl] -benzenesulfonamide), a sulfonamide antibiotic, a heavily used swine antibiotic in the U.S. and European Union. Sorption of sulfonamides by whole soils, soil minerals, and dissolved orga nic matter has been studied, but reports are absent on sorption of these compounds to black carbon, an important component of the soil carbon pool and a form of which (biochar) is proposed as a soil amendment. Adsorption by black carbon of ionizable compounds, a class that includes sulfamethazine, is poorly characterized in general. Adsorption of the veterinary antibiotic sulfamethazine (SMT; a.k.a., sulfadimidine; pK a1 2.28, pK a2 7.42) on a charcoal was determined as a function of concentration, pH, inorga nic ions, and organic ions and molecules. SMT displayed unconventional adsorption behavior. Despite its hydrophilic nature (log Kow = 0.27), the distribution ratio Kd at pH 5, where SMT0 prevails, was as high as 106 L kg-1, up to 104 times greater than lit erature- reported Koc. The Kd decreases at high and low pH, but not commensurate with the decline in Kow of the ionized forms. At pH 1, where SMT+ is predominant and the surface is positive, a major driving force is - electron donor -acceptor interaction o f the protonated aniline ring with the -electron rich graphene surface, referred to as +- EDA, rather than ordinary electrostatic cation exchange. In the alkaline region, where SMT prevails and the surface is negative, adsorption is accompanied by near -stoichiometric proton exchange with water, leading to the release of OH and formation of an exceptionally strong H - bond between SMT0 and a surface carboxylate or phenolate, classified as a negative charge- assisted H - bond, (-)CAHB. At pH 5, SMT0 adsorption is accompanied by partial proton release and is competitive with trimethylphenylammonium ion, signifying contributions from SMT+ and/or the zwitterion, SMT\u00b1, which take advantage of +- EDA interaction and coulombic attraction to deprotonated surface groups. In essence, both pK a1 and pK a2 increase, and SMT\u00b1 is stabilized, in the adsorbed relative to the dissolved state. Adsorption of Aromatic Carboxylate Ions to Charcoal Black Carbon is Accompanied by Proton Exchange with Water The carboxylic acid functional group is abundant in natural soil organic matter and is present in the molecular structures of many natural and synthetic compounds released to soil, including plant exudates, Interaction of sulfamethazine (SMT) with the black carbon surface 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 natural signaling chemicals between rhizosphere species, pesticides, and environmental contaminants. Charcoal black carbon is a component of the soil carbon pool as a result of forest fires and deliberate burning practices. In addition, interest has emerged in the application of engineered charcoal from biomass waste, known as biochar, to agricultural and forest lands for its potential benefits to soil quality and for its carbon sequestration value. The effects of natural or added charco al on chemical and biological processes in the rhizosphere are mostly uncharacterized. A potentially critical property of charcoal with respect to these processes is its surface activity as an adsorbent. The adsorbent strength of charcoal towards organic compounds is a function of the biomass precursor, charring conditions (time and temperature profile, oxygen concentration), degree of post -charring weathering, and other factors that dictate specific surface area, microporosity, and surface chemistry of t he final material. Depending on these factors and abundance in soil, charcoal may contribute substantially to sorption, and therefore reduce the physical mobility and biological availability of contaminants, as well as the above-mentioned natural compound classes. Dr. Joseph Pignatello examined the adsorption of the allelopathic aromatic acids (AA), cinnamic and coumaric, to different charcoals (biochars) as part of a study on bioavailability of natural signaling chemicals in soil. Sorption isotherms in pH 7 buffer, where the AAs are >99% dissociated, are highly nonlinear, give distribution ratios as high as 10 4.8 L/kg, and are insensitive to Ca2+ or Mg2+. In unbuffered media sorption becomes progressively suppressed with loading and is accompanied by rele ase of OH with a stoichiometry approaching 1 at low concentrations, declining to about 0.4 - 0.5 as the pH rises. Sorption of cinnamate on graphite as a model for charcoal was roughly comparable on a surface area basis, but released negligible OH. A novel scheme is proposed that explains the pH dependence of adsorption and OH-stoichiometry and the graphite results. In a key step, AA undergoes proton exchange with water. To overcome the unfavorable proton exchange free energy, we suggest AA engages i n a type of hydrogen bond recognized to be of unusual strength with a surface carboxylate or phenolate group having a comparable pK a. This bond is depicted as [RCO 2...H...O-surf]. The same is possible for AA, but results in increased surface charge. The pr oton exchange pathway appears open to other weak acid adsorbates, including humic substances, on carbonaceous materials. + O C RO O1/2 1/2 Proposed mechanism for interaction of organic acid anions with carboxyl or phenoxyl functional groups on the surfaces of black carbon The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 149 Soil Testing Testing soil samples for fertility and suggesting methods for growing better plants are a continuing service for citizens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Greg Bugbee tested 6,100 sam ples and answered 1,862 related inquiries Impact. The soil testing services and suggestions made by staff members at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawns and nursery stock throughout the state. This provides direct economic and environmental benefit to the suburban community by reducing nitrogen runoff into soil and water . 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including novel specialty crops, grapes, and the effect of the growing deer population on natural and managed lands capes. NEW CROPS PROGRAM Investigation of new crops is essential to provide new opportunities for farmers during a time of changing agriculture in Connecticut. Today, about 11,000 acres on 733 farms in Connecticut are devoted to vegetable production with a cash value of 30.2 million dollars. This compares to 19.1 million dollars from 582 farms in 2002. Seventy-nine percent of these farms are less than 100 acres in size; sixty -three percent are less than 50 acres in size. With numerous small farms, there is a need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops. In addition, small farm sizes in Connecticut have resulted in marketing shifts from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Approximately 313 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales rooms, where a variety of fruit, vegetables, nursery stock, and Christmas trees are offered. About 36 of these are open all year. Nearly 20% of these farms offer pick-your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cos t of harvest labor. These savings are passed on to the consumer. The development of a network of farmers' markets in Connecticut's major urban centers and densely populated suburbs is an important segment of direct sales of vegetables to consumers. All produce sold at farmers' markets must be \"Connecticut Grown\". Farm fresh produce is offered at reasonable prices to urbanites who cannot travel to the farms. Niche crops valued by diverse ethnic groups are generally sold at these markets. According to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, there were 125 farmers' markets in 2011, attended by over 400 farmers compared to 87 markets in 2007, a 52% increase. As the popularity of farmers' markets in Connecticut have surged, so too has the need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops. Consumers used to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in large supermarkets are seeking a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside stands. A recent survey of vegetable growers by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station showed that over 70 vegetable crops are currently being grown in Connecticut. Since 1982, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers. Over 40 fruits and vegetables have been studied resulting in over 50 publications. Results are also communicated to growers at meetings and farm visits. Some of the crops studied in the New Crops Program include globe artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes, specialty melons, okra, and tomatillos. Research included variety trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut. Crops tha t were chosen have a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 151 Pak Choi Trials : From 2000 to 2006, the Asian population in Connecticut grew 42%. This and other ethnic groups wish to continue consumption of vegetables that are customarily in their diets, thereby giving farmers opportunities for production of crops with a ready market. Ethnic vegetables also appeal to high -end buyers for whom ethnic vegetables are not every day fare, but who enjoy gourmet produce and culinary variety. Many farmers wish to diversify their operations by growing ethnic vegetables, but there is little information on the culture of these vegetables in Connecticut. It is important that cultural techniques for these veget ables be adapted to Connecticut's soils and climate. In 2011, Dr. Abigail Maynard evaluated 12 different varieties of pak choi on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. The average yield at Windsor (sandy terrace soil) was 23.2 T/A compared to 19.4 T/A at Impact: (32.2 T/A) and Win Win Choi (28.6 T/A) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $0.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of $63,756/acre. Many cultivars (All Seasons, Canton Short, Dwarf G reen Petiole, Green Boy, Mei Qing Choi, Summer Boy, and Summer Flavor) bolted at both sites in the spring and were unmarketable. A farmer growing these cultivars in the spring would have had a crop failure resulting in no income. Most Connecticut farmers a re now growing the cultivar Joi Choi. The long- term benefits include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. Thirty -five percent of Connecticut's vegetable growers answering our survey currently include pak choi in at their farms. Sweet Potato Trials: A 1998 Connecticut Department of Agriculture survey showed that sweet potato is one of the most popular specialty vegetables. In the South, the sweet potato is also called yam, but both are identical species. I n the United States, North Carolina and Louisiana are the leading producers, but we have found that they can easily be grown in Connecticut. This crop has both a high market value and an expanding market. In addition, it is very nutritious, with high values of beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamin C. In 2011, Dr. Maynard evaluated 6 cultivars that have short maturities (90 days) at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Beauregard and O'Henry averaged the greatest yields (3.8 lbs/plant) with Jewels averaging 3.5 lbs/plant. At a retail price of $0.79/lb, there is a potential crop value of $43,589/acre. Beauregard is the most popular cultivar grown in Connecticut with forty- one percent of the surveyed vegetable growers including sweet potatoes at their farms. The long- term benefits of growing sweet potatoes include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume sweet potatoes. Edamame Trials: Edamame are specialty varieties of soybeans that are harvested in the green stage. The word \"edamame\" means \"beans on branches\" and it grows in clusters on bushy branches. Edamame is consumed as a snack, a vegetable dish, used in soups or processed into sweets. As a snack, the pods are lightly boiled in salted water, and then the seeds are squeez ed directly from the pods into the mouth with the fingers. Outside East Asia, edamame is most often found in Japanese restaurants and some Chinese restaurants, but it has also found popularity elsewhere as a healthy food item. In 2011, Dr. Maynard evaluate d 11cultivars of edamame for yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Impact: The cultivar Sunrise had the greatest yield (1.3 lbs pods/plant) with Mojo Green averaging 1.2 lbs pods/plant . At a retail price of $2.49/lb, there is potential crop valu e of over $47,000/acre. By growing the cultivar Sunrise instead of the cultivar Beer Friend, the grower can potentially produce almost 13,000 more pounds per acre or gross almost $32,000 more per acre. The long- term benefits include additional revenue for farmers, especially those who attend farmers markets in urban areas. Five percent of the Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now growing edamame. Specialty Pumpkin Trials: The typical predominant market for pumpkins is for jack- o'-lantern types (12 lbs to 20 lbs). However, small pumpkins are often needed for operations specializing in school tours where each child receives a pumpkin to take home. Smooth pumpkins are preferred for painting or coloring. Specialty pumpkins come in a wide range of colors and color combinations including white, pale green, tan, burnt orange, and yellow. Shape also varies from the ideal round, to squatty with a flattened or concave top, to oval, to tall and elongated. In 2011, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of 12 varieties of specialty pumpkins at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Apprentice (9.1 fruit/plant), Jack Be Little (7.2 fruit/plant), Gooligan (6.7 fruit/plant), and Baby Bear (6.5 fruit/plant) had the greatest yields. At a retail pri ce of $1.00/pumpkin, there is a potential crop value of $33,033/acre. By growing the cultivar Apprentice instead of the cultivar Wee-B- Little, the grower can potentially produce almost 30,000 more pumpkins per acre or gross almost $30,000 more per acre. Si xty-eight percent of Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now including some of these cultivars in addition to growing Jack-O- Lanterns. The long -term benefits of growing specialty pumpkins include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers markets or have their own roadside stands. Specialty Eggplant Trials: Eggplants are a botanically diverse group that can be divided into two groups based on fruit shape and color. The first group, and more traditional type, is the teardrop- shaped, large-fruited eggplant. Fruit of these eggplants are typically oval or long, and tapered in shape with a black, purplish-black, or purple skin color, often with a green calyx. The second group is collectively referred to as the \"specialty\" eggplants, some of which are referred to as \"Asian\" eggplants. Asian eggplants generally have a purple calyx. Fruit shapes of specialty eggplants vary, but are often long and smooth, ball- or bell-shaped. In 2011, Dr. Maynard evaluated 10 varieties of specialty eggplants on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Hansel (19 lbs/plant), Calliope (16 lbs/plant), and Fairy Tale (15 lbs/plant) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $1.49/lb, there is a potential crop value of $102,765/acre. The cost of producing ethnic eggplant varieties at the UMass Research Farm was estimated to be $6,000/acre. Based on this information, the total net receipts for Hansel grown at the UMass Research Farm would have exceeded $95,000/acre. Forty- six percent of Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now growing some of these specialty eggplant cultivars. The long-term benefits of growing specialty eggplant include an The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 153 additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers markets or have their own roadside stands. Specialty Pepper Trials: Specialty peppers include both hot and sweet varieties of unusual shape, size, or color. Colored peppers have extra flavor, nutrition, and aesthetic appeal, and therefore command a higher market price. Most colored peppers are obtained by leaving the fruits on the bush until they reach mature color (e.g., red, yellow, orange). Others, such as banana pepper, are pale yellow even when immature. Green bell peppers are high in vitamin C (one medium green bell pepper contains 177 percent of the RDA for vitamin C). As they mature and sweeten (turn color), the vitamin A content rises 9 -fold while the vitamin C content doubles. In 2011, Dr. Maynard evaluated 10 varieties of specialty peppers on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: Early Sunsation (yellow) had the greatest yields (8.8 lbs/plant) followed by Chablis Hybrid (red) (8.4 lbs/plant) and Lilac Hybrid (Lavender) (7.7 lbs/plant). At a retail price of $2.49/lb, there is a potential crop value of $119,311/acre. The long- term benefits of growing specialty peppers include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers markets or have their own roadside stands. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume colored bell peppers. Sixty -eight percent of Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now growing specialty peppers. SHEET COMPOSTING OF OAK AND MAPLE LEAVES Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer undecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow them under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf decomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet co mposting operation. This is also a situation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predominance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr. Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994-2010 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling. In 2011, lettuce, eggplant, and onions were grown with all plots receiving the same amount (1300 lb/A) of 10-10-10 fertilizer. Yields from plots amended with oak leaves were compared to plots amended with maple leaves and the unamended controls. Lettuce yields from plots amended with maple leaves had the greatest yields (1.6 lbs/head) compared to yields from the plots amended with oak leaves (1.1 lbs/head) and the unamended control plots (1.0 lbs/head). The greatest eggplant yields were from plots amended with oak leaves (15.5 lbs/plant) followed by plots amended with maple leaves (15.1 lbs/plant) and the unamended control plots (14.3 lbs/plant). The greatest onion yields were from the plots amended with oak leaves (8.6 lbs/10 ft row) 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 followed by the control plots (7.9 lbs/10 ft row) and plots amended with maple leaves (6.6 lbs/10 ft row). Impact: Many Con necticut homeowners are now disposing of their oak and maple leaves in their gardens without worrying about any deleterious effects on yields in their vegetable gardens. Incorporating tree leaves into gardens improves the environment by storing carbon in the soil and reducing the volume of material in the solid waste collection and disposal system. REDUCING ANIMAL DAMAGE Rabbit Repellent Trial: A deer repellent trial conducted on Japanese yews ( Taxus cuspidata 'Densiformis') by Drs. Ward and Williams in 2007 revealed that some commercially available deer repellents were more effective than others. In general, repellents that were applied more frequently performed better. In 2011, Dr. Williams launched a deer repellent study on Hosta (Hosta hosta 'Fran cee') that initially was intended to investigate the effectiveness of repellent formulations that could be made relatively inexpensively in a homeowners kitchen. Then in 2012, a repellent manufacturing company sponsored an eastern cottontail ( Sylvilagus floridanus ) repellent trial. A captive cottontail population was established and 8 different commercially available repellents are actively being tested on various species of lettuce, Johnny jump-ups (Viola tricolor ), and alfalfa ( Medicago sativa) against plants receiving no treatment and those protected by a fence. Results will be available at the end of the 2012 growing season. IMPACT: Browse damage from overabundant herds of white- tailed deer cause the Connecticut nursery and landscape industry $1.5 -$2 mi llion in direct damages to plants prior to sale at nurseries and garden centers as well as $1 million in lost sales to homeowners discouraged by repeated deer damage annually. However, rabbit damage to the growing industry has yet to be quantified, but is likely significant as well as a costly frustration to the recreational gardening public. Formulations to limit rabbit damage are often marketed as limiting deer damage as well and their usage could limit Connecticut nursery loses by $1.1-$1.5 million and could improve sales by $750,000 annually. Rehabilitated Fawn Survival and Behavior: Working collaboratively with Mr. Michael Gregonis of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, Dr. Williams is researching survival and dispersal of pen -raised white -tailed deer fawns for the second and final year of the study. Every year, a number of fawns are removed from the wild by well-intentioned, but misinformed members of the public and are raised by licensed wildlife rehabilitators. In the past, fawns were released back into the wild and their fate was unknown. In 2010, Mr. Gregonis and Dr. Williams radio-collared 19 fawns at three locations. Thirteen fawns were subjected to a hard release, in which fawns were transported to state forests and released. The remaining 6 fawns were subjected to a soft release, in which the pen door was opened and some food and water were provided. After 36 days, all 13 hard release fawns had died from various causes. After 85 days, all soft release fawns were dead. In fall 2011, 4 fawns were hard- released and 6 were soft-released. All 4 hard release fawns were dead within 4 days and 2 soft- release fawns are alive nearly 1 year after release. It is likely that the majority of fawns entered into this program are not orphaned at all, rather plucked from the wild while waiting for the doe to return. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 155 IMPACT: Pen -raising wild white -tailed deer fawns by hand provides too much human contact, imprinting fawns on humans, and ultimately resulting in near full domestication. Releasing them into the wild as domesticated stock incurs a survival rate of nearly zero. This research will be used to inform members of the Connecticut public to leave fawns in the wild as removing them will likely result in death. INVASIVE PLANT CONTRO L Two major threats to natural preserves and managed forests are exotic plant species and browsing by overabundant white- tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). Therefore, scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are examining both effects o f these two threats, and possible strategies to minimize their impacts and , thereby, enhance forest ecosystem services. Japanese Barberry Infestations Serve as a Refuge for Blacklegged Ticks: In many Connecticut forests with an overabundance the dominant understory shrub. This exotic invasive plant provides habitat favorable to blacklegged tick determine mouse and larval tick abundances at six replicate sites, Dr. Williams has been trapping mice since 2007 in unmanipulated dense barberry infestations, areas where barber ry was controlled, and areas where barberry was minimal or absent. The number of feeding larval ticks/mouse was recorded. Adult and nymphal ticks were sampled along permanent draglines within each treatment area, retained, and were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme disease in humans and pets. To date, there have been 1,691 white-footed mice captures. The number of captured mice did not differ between treatments. However, the average number of feeding larval ticks per mouse was highest on mice captured in dense barberry (6.0 larvae/mouse). Adult tick densities in dense barberry (207/acre) were higher than in both controlled barberry (90/acre) and no barberry (43/acre) areas. Ticks sampled from full barberry infestations and controlled barberry areas had similar infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi , 52 and 53% respectively. Adult tick infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi varied widely between treatments and study areas, but was lowest in areas where barberry was absent and generally lower where barberry was controlled. This in concert with the overall reduction in the adult tick cohort in areas where barberry was controlled resulted in 133 B. burgdorferi -infected ticks/acre in dense barberry, 55/acre where barberry was controlled, and 22/acre where barberry was absent. Results indicate that managing Japanese barberry will have a positive effect on public health by reducing the number of B. burgdorferi infected blacklegged ticks that can develop into motile life stages that commonly feed on humans. Mouse trapping and tick sampling efforts will continue for several more years to monitor long terms effects of controlling Japanese barberry. IMPACT: This r esearch is not only of interest from an ecological perspective, but also serves to scientifically document the potential negative impacts an invasive plant can have on human health. This research has been featured on gardening websites and multiple forest land managers have used it to strengthen their argument for the increased need to control invasive plants. Results from this research will lead to improved interest in the 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 control of invasives, and ultimately, a reduction in the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme disease in humans and domesticated animals. Various entities within the towns of Redding, Weston, Easton, Guilford, Greenwich, Hampton, Mansfield, and Coventry and in the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York have used these resu lts in part to justify equipment purchase and initiate or reinvigorate invasive plant control programs. Additionally, numerous towns in Connecticut as well as the states of Delaware and Maryland and the Province of British Columbia have used our research l inking deer and invasive plants to scientifically justify their respective deer management programs. The Japanese Barberry Infestation Microclimate : In spring 2008, two additional Japanese barberry management plots were established in Redding and North Branford, CT. Each plot was approximately 5 acres in size and Japanese barberry was controlled by Drs. Williams and Ward and J. P. Barsky using 400,000 BTU propane torches. This control strategy differs from previous efforts in that dead Japanese barberry plants remained standing instead of being removed altogether. We hypothesized that dense Japanese barberry infestations may retain humidity, resulting in increased abundances of blacklegged ticks, which require stable and humid conditions to survive. Therefore, temperature/relative humidity sensors were deployed from June-December 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, again in 2012 in areas where barberry was controlled, areas where barberry was not controlled, and areas where barberry was virtually absent. In addition, blacklegged ticks and white-footed mice have been continually sampled during sensor deployment. Sensor data analysis from 2008-2011 has revealed that unmanaged Japanese barberry infestations provide excellent habitat for blacklegged tick survival because, due to their closed canopy-like growth form, they retain more of the humidity from the previous night throughout the following day than do areas where barberry was controlled or absent. Additionally, the Japanese barberry canopy buffers temperature and relative humidity swings throughout the day, providing a more stable microclimate than areas where barberry was controlled or absent. Because blacklegged ticks have a high surface area to volume ratio, they are prone to desiccation, and as a result, need a con tinually humid and stable microclimate to survive, which the exotic invasive Japanese barberry appears to provide. Sensors will be retrieved at the end of 2012 and ticks and mice will continue to be sampled. IMPACT: This research investigates the causal me chanism behind the increased abundances of blacklegged ticks found in Japanese barberry infestations. By understanding this relationship, land managers can better target problem areas where Japanese barberry is most prevalent, which will ultimately lead to a reduction in the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme disease in humans and domesticated animals. RESTORING NATIVE VEGETATION A crucial first step in restoration of natural areas is eradication or control of invasive species. However, regulations (e.g., drinking water supply watersheds, local ordinances), deeds, or active public opposition can severely limit herbicide application as a management option to control The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 157 invasives species on some properties. In the absence of an effective biological control agent, options to control invasives without synthetic herbicides are limited to mechanical methods, fire, and organic herbicides. The paucity of reported research on the efficacy, or lack of efficacy, of options other than synthetic herbicides for many invasive species can result in managers implementing control strategies that are not effective. Investing limited resources in non - effective control efforts can be frustrating and lead to the erroneous conclusion that any control effort is a futile exercise. Deer Browse Exclosure Study : One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species dive rsity of vegetation protected from white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ) browse to unprotected plots. Drs. Williams and Ward are collecting vegetation data within sixteen deer exclosures and sixteen adjacent control plots throughout the state. Deer ex closures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within. Growth rates and species diversity of enclosed vegetation are compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation. The project is a collaborative effort with The Natur e Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclosures (and adjacent control plots), at Burnham Brook Preserve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement in Salem, and Devil's Den Preserve in Weston. We are also including four of our own exclosures on South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford. Plots have been sampled for herbaceous species cover in the spring of 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Late summer sampling was conducted in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 and included all woody and herbaceous plants. Preliminary data analyses indicate that herbaceous cover within exclos ures is greater than control plots. Density of tree seedlings at least two feet tall is twice as high within exclosures compared to control plots. All locations will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late summer 2012. Results from this study will reveal plant species composition and growth rates in the absence of browsing deer. IMPACT: Overabundant herds of white -tailed deer negatively affect forest regeneration by repeated browsing. This in turn will negatively affect the future of t he timber industry and other wildlife populations in Connecticut. The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut uses these data to scientifically justify and document the results of their deer management program by educating their constituency on the negative impacts of overabundant white - tailed deer on the very forest flora and fauna they are charged with protecting. The Nature Conservancy also uses these data as a benchmark with which to monitor and compare noticeable browse damage on other properties which may require deer reduction. Japanese barberry : Japanese barberry is listed as invasive in 20 states and 4 Canadian provinces and is associated with enhanced population densities of blacklegged ticks that can transmit the causal agent of Lyme disease. Drs. Jeff rey Ward and Scott Williams continued their studies of alternative methods to control Japanese barberry begun in 2006. This research both evaluated the effectiveness and relative costs among treatment combinations to control Japanese barberry, and by monitoring individual clumps across a range of size classes, assessed whether treatment prescriptions are dependent on clump size. The barberry control study now includes 149 plots at 28 study areas that has examined 55 treatment/timing options. This year, we will highlight a study that e xamined the long- term effectiveness of treating Japanese barberry and the impact of those treatments on other plant species. 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Beginning in 2007, the effectiveness of various alternative treatments to reduce barberry cover, including a two -step process, was examined at eight study areas over 4 -5 years. Prescribed burning and mechanical mowing by wood shredder or brush saw were utilized as initial treatments to reduce the above-ground portion of established barberry. All initial tre atments were equally effective in reducing barberry cover. However, without a follow- up treatment, barberry had recovered to 56-81% of pretreatment levels 50- 62 months after initial treatment. Follow -up treatments in mid -summer to kill new sprouts included foliar application of triclopyr or glyphosate, directed heating, and untreated controls. Relative to untreated controls, areas with follow-up treatments had lower barberry cover 50 -62 months after initial treatment, 75% and 17% cover, respectively. All follow -up treatments were equally effective although the labor cost of directed heating was at least four times higher than for foliar herbicide applications. Follow - up treatment type (directed heating vs. herbicide) had minimal impact on species other than barberry. While deer browsing did not have an impact on barberry cover, areas protected from browse damage had higher cover of Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), and total non- natives. Areas protected from deer browsing had lower cover of native grasses and ferns. Excellent reduction of Japanese barberry cover can be achieved using either propane torches or herbicides as follow- up treatments in a two -step process, but other invasive plants may become a problem w hen barberry is removed if deer populations are low. Japanese stiltgrass: Another species that has become a serious invasive plant in the eastern United States, including southern New England, is Japanese stiltgrass ( Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus). Stiltgrass is an annual grass species native to eastern Asia that is now found in Connecticut and at least twenty-seven other states from Florida to Texas, north to Illinois, and east to Massachusetts. USDA Forest Service lists stiltgrass as one of the w orst thirty -three invasive plants of southern forests. Depressed native plant populations associated with stiltgrass infestations may be the result of direct competition for resources or allelopathic effects. Dead stiltgrass stems do not decompose readily and the layer that is left behind after each growing season can form dense thatch that prevents native plant seedlings from emerging. Stiltgrass can also alter soil biota and chemistry. The biotic and abiotic changes caused by stiltgrass have a direct impa ct on habitat quality for wildlife, birds, and pollinators that are adapted to native plant species. Lastly, stiltgrass alters the aesthetic characteristic of infested forests and may have an impact on public perception and utilization of parks and preserves. Drs. Jeffrey Ward and Todd Mervosh (Valley Laboratory) compared the efficacy of herbicides and non- chemical options found effective for controlling stiltgrass in earlier studies with organic herbicides and with herbicides used at reduced rates in a wooded floodplain along the lower Connecticut River. They compared the impact of two years of conventional and alternative treatments on cover of other non-native species and on native species. Four blocks of eighteen 3 by 4-m plots were established in May 2008. Treatments included directed heating with a propane torch (June, July), hand- pulling (July), mowing with a string trimmer (July, August), and foliar applications of household vinegar [5% acetic acid] (June, July) and the herbicides imazapic (June), pel argonic acid (June, July), and pelargonic acid plus pendimethalin (June). The following herbicides were applied at labeled doses and at one-fourth labeled doses: fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (July), glufosinate (August), and glyphosate (August). Stiltgrass cover and height were evaluated periodically, and plant samples were collected in autumn of 2008 and 2009 to determine the number of viable seeds produced. Final evaluations were taken in June 2010 after two years of treatment. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 159 Stiltgrass cover averaged 88% on unt reated plots in fall of all years. All treatments reduced stiltgrass coverage and seed production. The least effective treatments were hand-pulling, pelargonic acid, and vinegar in July. Direct heating, mowing, and vinegar in June reduced seed production by more than 90%. All treatments containing imazapic, pelargonic acid plus pendimethalin, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, glufosinate, and glyphosate completely prevented stiltgrass seed production in the second year of treatment. Based on this study, Japanese stiltgrass can be effectively controlled over a two -year period with a variety of herbicides, including at one-fourth labeled dose, and non- chemical treatments. Use of herbicides at low doses might minimize public opposition while providing effective control and reducing environmental impact. Control of Japanese stiltgrass can be achieved without herbicides, but non- chemical methods will require additional time and labor costs. IMPACT: To improve drinking water quality and reduce the risk of exposure to Lyme disease, water companies in Connecticut (Aquarion), Rhode Island (Providence Water), and Massachusetts (MDC) initiated or expanded their invasive control management efforts during the pa st year on nearly 150 acres. The CT D epartment of Energy and Environmental P rotection , Forestry has expanded their efforts to control invasives by treating 6.5 acres in 2011. Land trusts that have continued or initiated barberry control include Aspetuck, Guilford, Haddam, Joshua, Lyme, and Salem. Over 96% of 128 att endees of an invasive control webinar who collectively managed 2.2 million acres reported a moderate or significant knowledge change. In addition, they will take the following actions [annotated list]: educate public, promote more invasive species control (agency personnel); discuss issue in management seminars, share information with landowners (educators); start barberry eradication program for several clients, work at reducing more exotics, modify approach and techniques used to manage exotic (foresters) ; step up barberry control, kill all barberry on 40 acres, burn barberry as opposed to mechanically pulling it out, press adjoining neighbors to control their invasives (woodland owners). REHABILITATING POORLY STOCKED FORESTS The value of the forest to Connecticut is much more than the timber and other forest products. First and foremost, forests protect watersheds, aquifers and groundwater supplies that provide the bulk of our clean drinking water. Trees can also provide air pollution control, acting as g iant filters to remove dust, particulates, and some airborne chemicals. In addition, trees cool our environment in the summer by recycling water and reflecting sunlight. Forests contribute to the character of Connect icut add to our enjoyment throughout the year. Poorly stocked stands have too few trees to fully utilize available growing space; resulting in low productivity, including carbon sequestration, compared with fully stocked stands. In addition, poorly stocked oak forests generally have trees of les s desired species with lower quality stems and irregular stand structures that are logistically difficult to manage. Poorly stocked stands are a common problem across a broad geographical extent - occupying more than 200,000 acres in Connecticut and 660,000 acres in southern New England. Across a wider region encompassing New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, 3.0 of 18.9 million acres of oak forests are poorly stocked. There are an additional 7.5 million acres of moderately stocked oak forests in 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 the region that are one harvest away from becoming poorly stocked. Oak forests that are not fully stocked are especially at risk of exploitive and unsustainable timber harvesting that can create poorly stocked forests. In 2012, Dr. Jeffrey Ward began to evaluate the costs and effectiveness of two systems for rehabilitating poorly stocked stands that could be implemented on family forests (small, privately owned forests), whose owners could accomplish much of the treatments. The first system will be a low intensity, minimal or no cost approach that promotes the desired size class by harvesting firewood and, in some cases, removing cull trees and releasing a limited number of saplings. The second system will be a high -intensity approach with the expense of remediation secondary to the emphasis of maximizing development of the desired size class. Results of this study could be used by many of the 1.3 million owners of 10- 50 acre forest parcels in the Northeast and Midwest. Depending on market conditions and management objectives, one of these systems could also be utilized by owners with larger holdings such as state agencies, water companies, or private corporations (e.g, forest industry, timber investment management organizations). Prescription goals are defined as one of four possible desired conditions after treatment: poletimber, sapling, regeneration, or two- aged stands. TARGET trees are defined as pole or sapling stems selected for release from competition using quality tree criteria. This project will conduct four simultaneous, parallel experiments - one for each prescription goal. Rather than repeat design elements common to all experiments, the project will be described as a single experiment. Plot treatment times - Four study sites have been established in poorly-stocked forests that had had a significant oak component prior to previous harvests. Each study site has nine 0.04 ha plots for each prescription goal and a total of 80 plots have been established. Data have been col lected for all trees with diameters greater than 12.5 cm and subplots have been sampled for smaller stems. After data collection is completed in 2012, treatments will be assigned and completed. IMPACT: Family forest owners will be provided with management tools to bring their forests up to their full productive capacity. This project emphasizes treatment options that could be implemented by non- professionals with minimal training to increase the likelihood of widespread adaption by landowners without a prof essional forestry background. A very modest gain of 5% productivity across the three million acres of poorly stocked oak forests would be equivalent to adding 150,000 acres of productive forest and would have the additional benefit of increasing value adde d by concentrating growth of trees of higher quality species with superior stems. VITICULTURE Winegrape growers and Farm Wineries in Connecticut face many challenges. Farm Wineries are required to grow a minimum of 25% of the fruit in their total output, but are having trouble meeting this standard. Consecutive very cold winters in 2003 and 2004, as well as in 2009 and 2011 resulted in significant plant loss on less cold hardy cultivars, and drove up prices for purchasing Connecticut fruit. Little information is available to growers regarding cultural information for growing more cold hardy and disease resistant cultivars in the state. Growers of more traditional cultivars require more information on cultural practices and their effects on long-term vine hea lth and fruit quality. Disease management is critical during the growing season due to Connecticut's warm, humid summers. The industry requires increased production The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 161 via better management practices in existing vineyards and improved cultivar selection in ne wly planted vineyards. Innovative practices need to be tested in Connecticut to assess their viticultural and economic appropriateness. Winegrapes: Studies have been initiated by Dr. William R. Nail from 2004-2012 to help determine cultural practices for g rowing high quality winegrapes profitably in Connecticut. The winegrape industry in Connecticut is one of the most rapidly expanding categories of agriculture in the state. The first Farm Winery opened in 1979, and there are currently 30 wineries with a Farm Winery license, with two or three more scheduled to open each year in the foreseeable future. The existence of these wineries adds substantially to local economies, as local restaurants, hotels, bed and breakfasts, and other establishments receive increased business due to their proximity. The Connecticut Wine Trail brochure, published by the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association, is the most popular brochure in the Department of Tourism travel offices. Cultural practices in Vitis vinifera: Dr. Na il established a planting of 288 Pinot Gris vines at Lockwood Farm in summer, 2004. Two different rootstocks were used: 3309C, the most commonly planted rootstock in the state, and 101-14, which may tend to ripen fruit earlier and have better tolerance to severe winter freezes. Impact: Vines grafted to 101- 14 had 32% less mortality due to winter freeze damage than those grafted to 3309C following their first winter. Crown gall in subsequent years continues to be slightly higher in 3309C vines. There were no significant differences in productivity or fruit quality between rootstocks without crown gall through the 2011 growing season. Planting on rootstocks more resistant to winter damage can result in savings of $7.60 for each year of lost production per vin e, plus $3.75 replacement cost per vine plus labor involved in removing diseased vines and replanting Effects of graft union height: Freeze damage to grafted grapevines frequently occurs at the graft union, which is typically very close (one to two inches) to the ground. Crown gall, caused by Agrobactium vitis , is a devastating and often lethal disease of grapevines, and frequently occurs on severely freeze-damaged vines, although symptoms may not appear for one or two years after the freeze event. Elevating the height of the graft union may result in less injury. Chardonnay clone 96 budwood was grafted onto 3309C rootstock at standard height and 26 inches higher in 2006, and vines were transplanted in spring 2007 to vineyards at Lockwood Farm and Westport, Massachusetts. Temperature data loggers have been installed at both graft union heights to monitor differences in temperature at the graft unions. Vines have been evaluated for bud fruitfulness, winter freeze damage, and crown gall incidence and severity beginning in 2008. Yield and fruit quality were evaluated beginning in 2009. Impact: Vines with crown gall typically require replacement. High -grafted vines may result in significant reduction in such losses, which would be approximately $2,150 plus labor per acre for each 10% of vine mortality. In the absence of snow cover, daily minimum temperatures averaged 0.5 to1.5 \u00baC higher at the higher graft union level. While no significant differences in crown gall incidence or severity have been observed i n the experimental vineyards, the high grafted vines have been more economical to manage, as their single straight trunks are less susceptible to inadvertent tractor and herbicide 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 damage. High grafted vines had a high potential yield of high quality fruit during their second year after transplanting, while low grafted vines would traditionally have had no yield. This potential yield of fruit, estimated at $2,000 per ton, would offset the increased cost production of the high grafted vines. Training and spacing effects on vine performance and fruit quality of hybrid cultivars: Grapevines in most older vineyards in Connecticut are planted on six foot spacing and trained to a vertically shoot positioned system. This has generally worked well for most vinifera cultivars and some hybrids. Recently released hybrid cultivars that are rapidly finding favor frequently have different growth habits that make them unsuitable for this traditional spacing and training. Within-row spacing of grapevines in the vineyard is one of the most critical decisions to be made at planting. Too close spacing results in excessive competition and excessive vegetative growth, leading to reduced yields of poor quality fruit. Spacing that is too far apart results in unproductive utilization of valuable vineyard space. The choice of spacing is permanent. However, errors made at planting can sometimes be partially remedied by dividing the canopy to accommodate vine growth. Divided canopies can increase yield per unit of linear row length, but are more difficult and labor -intensive to establish and maintain. To evaluate spacing and training systems for new cultivars, Dr. Nail established a new planting of the hybrid cultivars St. Croix and Cayuga White in May, 2005 at a private commercial vineyard in Wallingford. These cultivars are among the most popular hybrids for new plantings. They have different growth habits and management issues than vinifera cultivars, which may involve fundamental issues both before and after planting. Plants of both cu ltivars were planted at six and eight foot spacings, and were trained to four different training systems beginning in 2009: Vertically Shoot Positioned, Hudson River Umbrella, Geneva Double Curtain, and Scott Henry. This experiment is part of The Northern Grapes Project, which consists of 35 scientists from 13 states. Impact: The results of this study will allow both new and existing growers to help maximize their production, as well as possibly demonstrating that some systems are not efficient in Connecticut. The data collected to date suggest that the vertically divided Scott Henry system was most productive in the first year of full production, while the horizontally divided Geneva Double Curtain was much more productive in the second through fourth years than the other training systems. There were no differences in fruit quality among training systems. However, divided canopies require more intensive management than single canopies. Data were collected beginning in 2010 to determine the relative cost of maintaining these different training systems. This will assist growers in determining if the increased yields per linear unit of row will justify the additional labor and supply costs of divided canopy systems. Pruning systems: Most grapevines in Connecticut have traditionally been cane pruned. Cane pruning requires skilled labor, which is increasingly in short supply. Spur pruning to a cordon system requires less skilled labor and lends itself to mechanization. A planting of the hybrid The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 163 cultivars Cayuga White and St. Croix, both trained to four different training systems, was established in 2005. Beginning in 2011, vines on six-foot spacing were pruned to either cane or cordon (spur) pruning to compare the relative efficiencies of these pruning methods. Data on yield and fruit quality parameters were collected beginning in the 2011 harvest season, and will continue for at least three more years. This experiment is also part of The Northern Grapes Project. Impact: Cordon pruning is a viable alternative to the cane pruning method used in most Connecticut vineyards. Skilled labor costs, essential to cane pruning, are approximately 30% higher than unskilled labor costs. Of equal importance is the increasing unavailability of skilled labor. Over the course of a previous experiment on hybrid grapevines, there were no differences in yield, fruit quality, or any measured vegetative parameters measured between cane and cordon pruned vines. Therefore, cordon pruning can reduce pruning costs by approximately 30% for growe rs. Cultivar and clonal evaluation: Beginning in 2004, Dr. Nail has evaluated previously established experimental plots at Lockwood Farm and a private grower's vineyard in Shelton. The results of these trials have been published in station bulletins. New cultivar trials were established at Lockwood Farm and the Valley Laboratory in spring, 2008, in conjunction with the national project \"NE-1020: Multistate Evaluation of Winegrape Cultivars and Clones\". This project involves over 50 scientists from over 30 states, allowing for evaluation of regional comparisons of vegetative and fruit qualities. The planting at Lockwood Farm is the third largest planting in the Eastern United States. Both plantings contain established cultivars whose characteristics have been documented, as well as unreleased and untested cultivars whose performance in Connecticut are unknown. Data collection on these vines began with pruning data in spring 2010, and will continue for several years. Experimental wines were made from selected cultivars at the Enology laboratory at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station at Geneva in 2011, and will be evaluated for wine chemistry and sensory qualities beginning in 2012 and continue for several years. Impact: The NE -1020 plots will provide Connecticut growers with valuable information on the suitability of new cultivars if and when they are released. Viticultural and fruit quality characteristics are important when a new cultivar is introduced into a region. The results of these trials will a llow growers to make informed decisions as to the selection of appropriate new cultivars and their cultural requirements. Northern grapes : Many new, very winter -hardy hybrid winegrape cultivars have been developed relatively recently by plant breeders in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Some, such as St. Croix, have found favor with many Connecticut growers. These new cultivars are based on the American species Vitis riparia . Riparia-based cultivars typically have much higher acidity than more traditional winegrap e cultivars. New, as yet unreleased cultivars are untested in the state. Several new cultivars are being evaluated at Lockwood Farm and the Valley Laboratory. This is in conjunction with the Northern Grapes Project as well as NE-1020. Besides basic fruit quality parameters analyzed at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, more thorough analyses from all participating states will be conducted at the Midwest Grape and Wine Industry 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Institute at Iowa State University. Vegetative, fruit, and yield da ta were collected beginning in 2011, and will continue for at least four more years. Impact: Fruit quality from new riparia -based cultivars may pose problems for winemakers using traditional methods. By evaluating the fruit chemistry of these new cultivars, decisions regarding cultivar selection based on fruit acidity as well as standard yield and vegetative parameters will assist growers in selecting appropriate cultivars when they are released commercially. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 165 DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY The mission of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology is to manage plant health problems using innovative methods to protect the environment, ensure a safe food supply, and maintain a healthy landscape for Connecticut. Our diverse basic and applied re search programs seek a better understanding of the biology and ecology of plant pathogens and interactions between plants, pathogens, and the environment. Our services focus on the diagnosis of plant health problems for all Connecticut residents, includin g homeowners, plant care professionals, and commercial growers. The Department also has an active outreach program, which offers numerous fact sheets, disease management guides, web-based information, workshops, and presentations for grower groups, garden and horticultural clubs, special interest groups, and students. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Boxwood blight In October 2011, samples of boxwood plants with unusual symptoms were submitted to The Plant Disease Information Office for diagnosis. Dr. Sharon M. Douglas and Ms. Mary Inman observed leaf spots and blights, distinctive black cankers on stems, rapid defoliation, and severe dieback on affected plants (photos). After extensive microscopic examination and a search of the literature, the disease was tentat ively identified as boxwood blight, caused pseudonaviculatum ( syn. C. buxicola) . Since this fungus had not been reported in the U.S., samples of infected plants were sent to national mycologists at the United States Departmen t of Agriculture -Animal Plant Health Inspection Service -Plant Protection and Quarantine (USDA-APHIS-PPQ) for identification. They confirmed the fungus as C. pseudonaviculatum. Boxwood blight has been found in commercial and residential landscapes, garden centers, and nurseries in 5 counties in CT, as well as in 10 states in the U.S. including MA, MD, NC, NY, OH, OR, PA, RI, and VA, and two provinces in Canada (BC and ON). This disease was first described in the United Kingdom (UK) in the mid-1990s, and is found in New Zealand and throughout Europe. Boxwood blight has been reported to occur on all Buxus species to date, although some species and cultivars appear to be more susceptible than others. Buxus sempervirens (American or common boxwood) and B. sempervirens 'Suffruticosa' (English boxwood) appear to be highly susceptible. The complete host range of this pathogen is not known. However, experimental inoculations have demonstrated that other members of the boxwood family (Buxaceae) are susceptible, including Sarcococca and more recently, Dr. James LaMondia and CAES colleagues determined that Pachysandra terminalis and P. procumbens are also experimental hosts. In addition, samples of pachysandra from an established planting adjacent to boxwood blight -infected boxwood were confirmed to be infected by C. pseudonaviculatum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a natural infection of pachysandra in the landscape. 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 The fungus infects all aboveground portions of boxwood plants, but does not appear to infect the roots. Infections result in leaf spots, leaf blights, and stem cankers that lead to defoliation and death of boxwood plants. We have found that the pathogen can be isolated from symptomless plants. Boxwood blight spreads very rapidly under warm, humid conditions, and the disease cycle can be completed in one week. The temperature range is 41 -86\u00b0F, with an optimum of 77\u00b0F. Moisture is necessary for infection, but wounds are not necessary. The fungus readily forms fruiting structures called sporodochia on infected plants. These structures produce abundant spores ( conidia) in a slimy matrix on all infected parts of the plant, including leaves and stems. The fungus also forms resting structures called microsclerotia that allow the fung us to survive for at least 5 years. These structures are found in infected plant tissues and in leaf debris. Boxwood blight spores are splash-dispersed and can be carried by wind or wind-driven rain over short distances. Longer distance spread is though t to occur through human activities (e.g., contaminated boots, clothing, and equipment), animals, and birds, since the spores are sticky. Infected plant material is the primary means for long- distance spread. In many cases, these are apparently \"healthy\" boxwood\u2014 plants that are infected but have no symptoms or plants that are treated with fungicides that suppress, but do not kill or eradicate the fungus\u2014are shipped to nurseries and landscapes. This method of disease transmission is often called the \"Tro jan horse\" or \"Typhoid Mary\" syndrome. At present, boxwood blight is not federally regulated, but in Connecticut, regulatory actions are under the statutory authority of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES), Sec. 22-84 and Sec 22-98 of the Connecticut General Statutes. When boxwood blight is detected, a \"Stop Sale Notice\" is given to the nursery or business. This prevents the sale and movement of infected plants from the quarantined property. Many CT properties have voluntarily disposed of infected plants by burial on the quarantined property or have transported them to incinerators under supervision by CAES inspectors. This has resulted in significant financial losses in the state, which have already exceeded $3 million. CT growers also report additional losses from cancelled orders for non -boxwood hosts, as a result of customer concerns about the uncertainty of the spread and survival of C. pseudonaviculatum . The Experiment Station, led by Dr. Douglas, took a prominent role in de veloping Best Management Practices (BMPs) that provided guidance for nurseries, garden centers, and landscapers for dealing with this disease and offered suggestions to minimize the spread of the disease through commerce and planting of infected material. CAES B est Management Practices served as a template for a number of other states. Dr. Robert E. Marra has been working with Dr. Jo Anne Crouch of the USDA- ARS in developing a realtime PCR assay for the early detection of the boxwood blight pathogen. In preliminary studies, Dr. Marra and Dr. Crouch have demonstrated fairly high specificity of the realtime assay to C. pseudonaviculatum ; most closely related sister species show no specificity to the assay, while two species, C. gracilipes and C. indonesiae , have shown marginal specificity that results in barely measurable amplification in the assay. Drs. Marra and Crouch are refining the assay to eliminate these cross-reacting results. Dr. Marra has also demonstrated that the C. pseudonaviculatum primers and probe work well in the presence of Buxus sp. DNA, which furthermore does not compromise the sensitivity of the assay (see figure below). In experiments in which increasingly small amounts of fungal DNA were added to Buxus DNA, Dr. Marra estimated dete ction of the pathogen DNA as low as 3 picograms. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 167 Dr. Marra utilized a PCR -RFLP assay developed by Dr. Kurt Heungens (Belgium) to determine that all 16 Connecticut isolates obtained at that point belong to the G1 genotype, and not the G2 genotype. This is an important finding, because Dr. Heungens and his group have demonstrated that the G2 genotype is resistant to certain fungicides. Dr. Marra sequenced the beta-tubulin gene from two Connecticut isolates of the pathogen, isolated by Dr. LaMondia; these sequences were used to confirm the identity of the pathogen by comparing these sequences against those of the type specimen in the GenBank database. The sequences from these two Connecticut isolates were then deposited in GenBank. Multiplex realtime PCR results showing amplification of both host and pathogen DNA. DNA from boxwood was spiked with serial 10-fold dilutions of DNA from C. pseudonaviculatum , and used as template in realtime PCR reactions containing primers and probes for the universal plant cytochrome oxidase (COX) gene and the C.ps.- specific beta-tubulin (Btub) gene. These results demonstrate the sensitivity and efficiency of the assay, as evidenced by the ~3.3 cycle shift in Ct value with each ten -fold dilution. Impact: Rapid detection and communication about this important new disease of boxwood and decisive regulatory actions by The Experiment Station helped to minimize the economic impact of boxwood blight on the Connecticut nursery industry. Although significa nt losses were reported, CAES actions helped to Amplification of Buxus COX pg30 pg3 pg Amplification of C.ps. Btub gene 168 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 maintain boxwood as a viable and important component of the Connecticut landscape and nursery industry. Butternut research Dr. Sandra L. Anagnostakis planted grafted butternut trees from Dr. Mark Coggeshall (University of MO) at Lockwood Farm in May 2012. These trees are grafts of surviving butternuts from PA, IA, and VT. They will be inoculated with strains of the butternut canker fungus isolated from Connecticut to determine whether they are resistant to this devastating disease. Chestnut breeding for orchard and timber trees Dr. Sandra L. Anagnostakis found Asian chestnut gall wasp galls (Dryocosmus this year. This insect was accidently introduced into the U.S. by a chestnut grower in central Georgia in 1974 and has been moved north by tree sales and by flight of the insect. Trees in New Haven, Hamden, Wallingford, and North Haven had galls this spring, but none were found in Windsor or Griswold. The insect can have a serious impact on the health of the trees, as well as reducing nut production. For several years, Dr. Anagnostakis has made crosses of trees known to be resistant to this insect with trees known to be susceptible (photo of gall wasp galls on Ameri can chestnut), and a test of the progeny in North Carolina where the wasp was established showed that the resistance can be inherited. This year, many crosses were made using both timber type trees and orchard trees with resistant species. The Chestnut Plantation at Sleeping Giant has all the species and most of the possible hybrids of chestnut, and they will be surveyed to determine which trees have the best resistance. Sudden vegetation dieback The role of the purple marsh crab Sudden vegetation dieb ack (SVD) of Connecticut salt marshes still continues to occur along Connecticut's Long Island Sound. Many sites showed increased dieback in 2011 and 2012 (photo at right), while other sites showed slight recovery. Dr. Wade H. Elmer hypothesized that a m ajor factor in the increased dieback may be grazing pressure by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum . In addition, a newly described pathogenic species, Fusarium palustre , has been found in every SVD site, but there is insufficient evidence to assume the fungus was a primary cause for SVD. Four studies have been conducted on agar amended with NaCl that show that the salt marsh fungus is more tolerant to salinity than genetically similar terrestrial species, indicating that F. palustre may have co -evolved with salt marsh plants and adapted to saline environments. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 169 Grazing pressure by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, may be affecting recovery from SVD sites. We hypothesized that inoculation of Spartina alterniflora (SA) with F. palustre ( FP), and/or drought may increase herbivory. SA were exposed to different irrigation regimes and inoculated with FP or left un-inoculated. Pairwise combinations of SA plants were placed in bins with marsh crabs and photographed over a 1-2 day period for visual estimates of loss due to consumption. Herbivory was greatest on drought -stressed plants and/or plants that were inoculated with FP. Plants exposed to the same treatments and transplanted into a crab -infested SVD site were similarly consumed. In other published studies, it was shown that stressed SA plants had higher levels of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) than healthy plants. To determine if DMSO was an attractant for the marsh crab, we drenched healthy SA and other grass species with DMSO (200 micromoles) to determine if it increased herbivory when compared to untreated plants. Consumption of SA was significantly greater in the first 4 hr. on DMSO-treated SA plants than on controls, but did not increase herbivory on other grass species. These finding s suggest that plant stress, whether by disease or drought, may increase the attractiveness of SA to herbivory by marsh crabs and that DMSO might function as a chemo- attractant in SA. Genetic variation and dispersal dynamics in Fusarium palustre in salt marshes of eastern United States In order to elucidate patterns of dispersal of the newly described Spartina pathogen associated with wetland dieback, Fusarium palustre, Dr. Robert E. Marra performed a genetic analysis of 90 isolates collected fr om marshes ranging from Louisiana to Maine. Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), Dr. Marra showed an unexpected amount of genetic variability among these isolates. Also of note was the observation that genetic variation was highest in th e northeast, with no isolates appearing to be clones. In contrast, all four isolates from a Louisiana marsh were clonal. This result suggests the hypothesis, which we are currently testing, that the pathogen may have been first introduced in northeastern North America, with subsequent clonal introduction to coastal areas of the southeast and the Gulf. Dr. Marra continues to work with Dr. Elmer in analyzing newly collected isolates, from the south and the Gulf, as well as isolates from S. alterniflora in China, which appear to be F. palustre . Impact : This research provides critical insights into understanding Sudden Vegetation Dieback. By identifying significant factors associated with marsh grass recovery in SVD sites, we have established a foundation for understanding how physiological changes in S. alterniflora may affect its attraction to herbivores. Additionally, we are defining the role that genetic variability and dispersal of F. palustre might contribute to this syndrome. Biochar and earthworms Biochar is a fine-grained or granular, charcoal- like product, that when applied to soil will suppress Fusarium crown and root rot of asparagus. Biochar may suppress disease by 1) absorbing toxins in the soil, 2) increasing mycorrhi zal colonization in the roots, and 3) allowing the densities of fluorescent pseudomonads to proliferate in the rhizosphere. These beneficial microbes help to suppress disease through antibiosis, competition, or induction of systemically acquired resistance mechanisms. Dr. Wade H. Elmer has demonstrated that vegetables grew better and had less root diseases when the soils were augmented with adult earthworms. In perennial plantings, where root systems cannot be 170 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 easily manipulated after planting , earthworms might be used to provide delivery of beneficial products like biochar to the lower soil horizons. Experimental field plots were established in 2010 at the Experiment Station research farms in Hamden, Windsor, and Griswold, and were designed t o examine the individual and combined effect of earthworms and biochar. Earthworms were reapplied in 2011. Yield was taken during the spring 2012 at all three locations (graph at right). Results were similar and show that earthworms significantly promoted yield (P = 0.046), but that biochar and the combination of earthworms and biochar were not statistically different, and that the control had no effects (graph at right). This may be due to the ability of biochar to bind up nutrients along with the toxi ns that led to smaller plants and less yield. Alternatively, the biochar may have been inhibitory to the earthworms and negated their impact. We will continue the study for another year. Impact: These studies may provide evidence that earthworm activity can result in increased yields. We presume this is due to improve soil health. It also highlights the many factors affecting the successful implementation of this technology and cautions growers as to the negative benefits of biochar. Suppressing plant disease with silicon application and partial soil saturation in a flooded floor greenhouse. Use of ebb and flow recycled watering systems has become more common in Connecticut, although a major disadvantage of recycled watering is the potential for disease outbreaks and the development of fungicide -resistant pathogens. A joint project with Drs. Wade Elmer, Martin Gent, Richard McAvoy (University of Connecticut), and Joe Geremia (Geremia Greenhouse, Yalesville, CT) resulted in the construction of a flooded floor greenhouse at Lockwood Farm. Earlier studies demonstrated that partial saturation could reduce disease severity, reduce plant size, and increase horticultural marketability. Our objectives were to determine if soluble silicon applications could reduce foliar and root diseases and how that might interact with different irrigation regimes. Poinsettias and zinnias were grown on partial and full saturation with and without silicon applied as potassium silicate. Potassium carbonate was used in the control pots to factor against the effect of potassium. Pythium root rot was suppressed on Si-treated poinsettia plants, but only on plants receiving full saturation. It was observed that powdery mildew on zinnia was more severe under partial saturation than full saturation. However, the application of silicon significantly suppressed powdery mildew when compared to the control (K 2CO3) (figure at right; control plant on left). Impact: Partial saturation can offer great value to growers who use ebb & flow irrigation systems to suppress Pythium diseases, by saving fertilizer, fungicides, and producing more marketable plants with longer shelf lives. However the added stress on plants such as zinnias increased the damage caused by powdery mildew. Each crop/disease system may need separate evaluation, but these findings should encourage growers to ado pt partial saturation management practices when using ebb and flow irrigation in order to reduce damage from Pythium inoculum. The value of using silicon applications to suppress powdery mildew was demonstrated. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 171 Bacterial spot of stone fruits Dr. Robert E. Marra continued work on a SARE project on bacterial spot of stone fruits. This project focuses on the development of a biological control method against bacterial spot, caused by the bacterium, Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Xap), one of the prominent diseases in southern New England, particularly of peach and nectarine. The strategy to be tested is whether we can use a bacteriophage, a natural viral enemy of the pathogen, to protect plants from infection and reduce the severity of the disease. We have already demonstrated that there is no genetic variation among all of 43 phage strains that were isolated from peach orchards in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts. This absence of phage diversity may pose problems for long -term sustainability as a biocontrol, as the bacterium can become resistant fairly rapidly. Repeated efforts to perform inoculations with the Xap bacteria on potted greenhouse peach trees (the highly susceptible variety O'Henry) failed, as did a \"detached branch\" assay, in w hich branches from the potted O'Henry peaches were excised and immediately placed in water in flasks, then sustained in the growth chamber, inside humidity tents, under a regime of 27C and 12/12 hours day/night. Using 3-5 such flasks for one treatment, and another 3- 5 flasks as negative controls, we attempted inoculations of the branchlets with suspensions of the Xap bacteria. Three orchards of 49 trees each were planted in 2010 at the three research farms, Lockwood, Windsor, and Griswold. The variety, Sweet Dream, is considered desirable in southern New England, but is too susceptible to Xap to be economically feasible. The trees were pruned again this past late spring using an open- center training technique, and any dead trees were replaced. Impact : Bacterial spot caused by Xap is a major problem for peach growers in Connecticut. Control options are limited, and expensive. A naturally occurring bacteriophage would qualify as organic disease control, making it a very desirable option for orchardis ts. Neonectria canker caused Robert E. Marra 's research on Perennial Canker (also known as Neonectria canker) focuses on the ecology and genetics of the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima, with the goal of gaining a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, and population dynamics of the organism and its interactions with its hosts, particularly black birch (Betula lenta ) and yellow birch ( B. alleghaniensis Fundamental knowledge of the natural history of N. ditissima is lacking, yet is an essential prerequisite to the development of an effective control strategy. Field techniques and laboratory tools necessary to the study of this fungus and the disease it causes have been developed and are being used to examine the relationship between mating system and genetic structure. Previously, Dr. Marra developed a set of 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Microsatellites are chains of repeating DNA motifs (e.g., acgacgacgacgacg) found throughout the genomes of most eukaryotes; variation in the number of motif repeats at a microsatellite locus underlies the length differences among alleles. These 13 markers were used to genotype ascospore progeny from 44 perithecia isolated from two nearly adjacent sites at West Rock Ridge State Park in New Haven, CT. Ranging in allelic diversity from 2 -15 alleles/locus, with an average of 4.3 alleles per locus in this population, the markers show an unusually high level of diversity. The pooled haplotypes of sibling 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 ascospores from each of the 44 perithecia resulted in 27 unique multilocus diplotypes, which were then used to estimate parameters of population structure. Minimally significant (p0.05) linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between several pairs of loci, but r\u00af d , a standardized estimate of multilocus LD, was not significant. Genetic differentiation between the two subpopulations was minimally significant at three loci ( Dest = 0.11, 0.17, 0.19), while the harmonic mean across all loci was not ( Dest = 0.01); therefore, all subsequent analyses were performed on the entire population. Absence of segregation among sibling haplotypes was observed in 23 of the 44 perithecia, yielding a selfing rate, s, of 0.52. Contrary to expectation given the high degree of genetic diversity, heterozygote deficiencies were observed at all loci: F is, the inbreeding coefficient, ranged from 0.39 to 1.0, and averaged 0.71 over all loci. Interestingly, F is estimated from only the outcrossed portion of the population (n=21) was still high, 0.42, supporting the hypothesis that biparental inbreeding contributed significantly to overall inbreeding in this population. These observations support theoretical models that posit the importance of biparental inbreeding to the evolutionary stability of mixed mating. The results confirm an earlier hypothesis that N. ditissima has a mixed mating system, albeit one in which selfing, not outcrossing, is the predominant mating mode. A predominance of selfing was unexpected, given that our previous work showed that there is a high degree of genetic variability among cankers (each maternal canker has a unique 13 -locus genotype), from which I have failed to reject a null hypothesis of complete random mating (i.e., no selfing). One conclusion that may be drawn from this, which requires further testing, is that there is strong selection against outcrossing, and that dispersal dynamics of this fungus are complex, and require further study. Impact: Due to its increasing abundance in Connecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although trees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring caused by the cankers renders them of little value for lumber or veneer. Our efforts to more fully understand the biology and natural history of N. ditissima is an important contribution in the fields of mycology and evolutionary biology, and will contribute to the identification and utilization of control strategies. Mathematical models of plant disease epid emics Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino has challenged the usefulness of latent period and infectious period as epidemic descriptors. One of the ramifications of his analysis is the need to express the dynamics of a plant disease epidemic in terms of the mean generation time and the higher order temporal moments of the time course of progeny production. To this end, a Laplace Transform- based analysis has been devised to compare the epidemiological behavior of current theoretical models of spore production in term s of the temporal moments of the reproduction curve. In addition, in order to compare theory to experiment, Dr. Ferrandino has derived a fourth order approximation that accurately and explicitly predicts the initial infection rate in terms of the temporal moments of the reproduction curve (experimental or theoretical). These research efforts resulted in publications in refereed journals. Future work will include both the spatial spread and the temporal development of plant disease epidemics. The dispersal of inoculum will be modelled using Lagrangian stochastic simulation models founded on a thorough knowledge of the nature of turbulence to calculate the form of the dispersal function. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 173 Impact: This research redefines the basic temporal measures of plant disease epidemics and provides m athematical models of plant disease with parameters that are directly determined using field data. These are essential for evaluating the efficacy and economic and environmental sustainability of IPM programs. Weather stations at CAES research farms Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino has converted the weather stations at the three CAES experimental farms to WIFI. This allows hourly updates of the data without any monthly service charge. The cost for the previous cell phone service was ~$40 per month per weather station. The informa tion obtained from these weather stations is used to calculate weekly grape disease - risk ratings, which are posted on the CAES website. This information is also sent out via Email directly to growers. The switch to WIFI allows Dr. Ferrandino to continue providing valuable information to growers without the need for outside funding. Environmentally -friendly control of powdery mildew on landscape plants and general fruit and foliar pathogens on vegetable crops. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his work on environmentally -friendly controls of powdery mildew on common home landscape lilac, deciduous azalea, monarda, phlox, peony, and rudbeckia) and vegetable planted in the home garden (tomato, pepper, eggplant, muskmelon, and pumpkin). All foliar and fruit pathogens are being monitored on the vegetable plants. The alternatives to conventional chemical controls include sprays of cow's milk, horticultural oil, and potassium bicarbonate products. In 2011, powdery mildew was observed o n monarda, phlox, and lilac (photo at right) by 11 July. However, due to the heavy rainfall in August and September, all plants suffered from both fungal and bacterial leaf spots. This complication made it difficult to estimate powdery mildew levels late r in the season in order to evaluate relative efficacy of the applied foliar sprays. This year, so far, disease levels are too low to evaluate the efficacy of the various sprays. Ramorum blight/Phytophthora ramorum Dr. Marra has been working with Dr. Douglas in supervising the implementation of USDA - mandated assays for detection of P. ramorum on nursery material shipped from California, Oregon, and Washington. Nursery surveys, trace forwards, and trace-backs are conducted in cooperation with Dr. Victo ria L. Smith and state inspectors. The screening process begins with a serological test called ELISA (enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay), which detects all Phytophthora species. The ELISA assays are performed by summer research assistants under the supervision of Drs. Marra and Douglas. If a sample tests positive by ELISA, Dr. Marra extracts DNA from it and then analyzes for P. ramorum - specific nucleotide sequences using two real -time PCR assays. 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 The Molecular Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory was gi ven Provisional Approval Status for P. ramorum by APHIS -PPQ and in March of 2012, Drs. Marra and Li were certified in the 2012 Proficiency Testing Program for two real- time PCR assays. Impact : P. ramorum is a pathogen of growing concern in Connecticut b ecause of the numerous species of plants and trees common in Connecticut that are known or suspected hosts. Much of this concern centers on Connecticut's significant horticulture industry, which at over $1 billion in annual production ranks Connecticut am ong the ten largest in the country and contributes to more than half of the total agriculture in the state. Nurseries found to have plants infected with P. ramorum are effectively quarantined until rigorously demonstrated to be clear of the pathogen, a pr ocess that can take several months. Therefore, Ramorum Blight, independent of its impact on our forests and landscapes, can have a significant impact on the state's economy. Many of the most susceptible hosts \u2014eastern red oak, northern white oak, rhododendron, lilac, mountain laurel, and viburnum, to name a few\u2014are significant parts of the nursery industry as well as Connecticut forests and landscapes. Given that the eastern United States, including Connecticut, is considered at high risk for P. ramorum , based on host distribution and climate, concern over the possible release of the pathogen into the environment is warranted. Through the Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory (MPDL), Dr. Marra's goal is to accelerate and refine our ability to identify P. ramorum in infected plants from the nursery, garden center, forest, and landscape, greatly increasing our chances of averting a Ramorum Blight epidemic. Additionally, the molecular diagnostic techniques being used and under development in the MPDL will c ontinue to enhance the disease diagnostics services provided to Connecticut's stakeholders. Noteworthy diseases The 2011-2012 season was one for extremes and unusual weather patterns that contributed to significant health problems on woody ornamental trees and shrubs in the landscape, on forest trees, and on herbaceous plants. Characterized as one of the wettest years on record, weather records at Lockwood Farm reported 68.61 inches of cumulative precipitation in 2011, when compared with the 30- year average of 47.73 inches. Abnormally high levels of precipitation and cool to moderate temperatures were recorded throughout the 2011 season, with the exception of July, and many diseases resulted from these favorable conditions. January through March of 2012 started out relatively dry, but the spring rains provided conditions conducive for infection by many types of pathogens. A second weather extreme of 2011 occurred in August, as Tropical Storm Irene swept through the state causing significant physical damage to many trees and salt spray and coastal flooding damage to many ornamentals and lawn grasses. The third weather extreme occurred in late October, when an historic snow storm left over 20 inches of snow in some parts of the state. The snow fell on trees that still had their leaves, so it resulted in significant breakage to trees and shrubs, which resulted in major power outages. Unusual weather continued into fall and winter 2011 with abnormally mild temperatures that appeared to affect leaf dr op, as many deciduous trees held onto their leaves well beyond the \"normal\" drop period. Many trees and woody shrubs did not enter into true winter dormancy and were damaged by sudden periods of cold temperatures that occurred in winter. Spring 2012 also posed a problem for many The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 175 woody ornamentals with summer- like temperatures followed by frost that caused damage to some deciduous trees and conifers. Disease Survey Dr. Yonghao Li, Dr. Sharon Douglas, and Mary Inman diagnosed a wide range of plant health problems for homeowners, commercial growers, plant care professionals, and government and cooperative extension personnel during the past year. Fungal, bacterial, and physiological disorder diseases contributed to key health problems on trees, shrubs, flow ers, lawn grasses, fruits and vegetables, although viral and nematode diseases were also identified on some hosts. Herbaceous and Woody Ornamentals: A wide range of diseases was identified on perennials and annual flowers this season including downy mildew on alyssum; Thielaviopsis root rot on calibrachoa; Rhizoctonia root rot brown rust and white rust on chrysanthemum; downy mildew on coleus; Heterosporium leaf spot root rot on geranium; rust hibiscus; anthracnose and tobacco rattle virus on hosta; Didymellina leaf spot on iris; bacterial leaf blight on phlox; bacterial Botrytis blight on poinsettia; smut on trillium; Botrytis blight on tulip; and rust on violet. Woody their diseases were abutilon with Thielaviopsis root rot; boxwood blight; butterfly bush bacterial leaf Tobacco rattle virus on hosta Impatiens necrotic spot virus on begonia 176 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 spot; flowering cherry with black knot, brown rot, fungal leaf spot, and bacterial leaf spot; clematis with Phyllosticta leaf spot; crabapple spot, with anthracnose, leaf spot, and powdery mildew; elm with Dutch elm disease and black spot; enkianthus with ant hracnose and Phyllosticta leaf spot; euonymus with crown rot eastern filbert blight; forsythia with spot and Botryosphaeria honeysuckle bacterial leaf and leaf spot, blight; and Phyllosticta leaf spot; mountain laurel with Cercospora l spot; and Tubakia leaf spot, leaf black spot, downy mildew; and willow with rust and black canker. Conifer species and their diseases were arborvitae with Pestalotiopsis tip blight; cypress with of beech Septoria leaf spot of birch The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 177 Common vegetable diseases were downy mildew of basil; fungal club rot, Alternaria leaf spot, Cercospora leaf spot, bacterial black rot, and bacterial soft rot of broccoli; bacterial black rot and Alternaria leaf spot of cabbage; Alternaria leaf spot and black rot of cauliflower; Septoria leaf spot and cucumber mosaic virus of celery; bacterial black rot and bacterial leaf spot of collard; rust and northern blight of sweet corn; Alternaria leaf spot of crambe; bacterial soft rot and anthracnose of cucumber; Phomopsis leaf spot of eggplant; rust, bacterial soft rot, and Penicillium soft rot of garlic; bacterial black rot of kale; bacterial leaf spot, damping -off, and Phytophthora blight of l ate blight and Phytophthora fruit rot of pumpkin; powdery mildew and bacterial leaf spot of squash; late blight, Septoria leaf spot, early blight, bacterial leaf spot, anthracnose, powdery mildew, and Fulvia leaf mold of tomato. Tree and Small Fruit: Common tree and small fruit species and diseases were apple with scab, powdery mildew, frogeye spot, fire blight, rust, and bitter rot; apricot with black knot, brown brown rot, and fungal leaf spot; grape with black knot, anthracnose, and leaf curl; pear with fungal leaf spot, scab, bitter rot, and fi re blight; plum with brown rot and Glomerella leaf spot; and raspberry with Septoria spur blight, and Botrytis blight. Turf: Common disease problems on residential lawns and golf courses were snow mold, powdery mildew, red thread, Rhizoctonia brown patch, slime mold, anthracnose, rust, summer patch, and Pythium root rot. Weeds: Predominant weeds in turf and -of- violets, and wild garlic. Spreading of true bamboos remained an increasing public concern. Identification and control of Japanese knotweed and poison ivy continued to be significant problems. Increased public awareness of non -native plants led to many inquiries about invasive plants. Impact: Information on the diseases that occur on plants in Connecticut landscapes, natural woodlots, and forests each year helps to monitor and assess the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This information also assists in detecting new diseases or in identifying potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. SERVICE ACTIVITIES 178 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in a wide range of service and public outreach activities. Some of these services involve presentations, publications, displays at meetings and other outreach events, tours of facilities, and interviews, in addition to being conducted in cooperation with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, inspectors from the Bureau of Regulation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture collect official samples of vegetable, crop, and lawn seeds for analysis. Samples are submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station since it is the official seed testing labor atory for Connecticut. The Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology performs the germination and purity analyses that are required for compliance with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. In 2012, 343 vegetable, 7 lawn, and 10 crop seed samples were submitted to Dr. Douglas for testing. Ms. Inman tests all seeds following strict protocols designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA). Seedlings are carefully examined, since they must appear \"normal\" (i.e., fre e from decay, have well- developed primary root systems, have well-developed and intact hypocotyls and/or epicotyls, and have healthy cotyledons). Vegetable seeds are tested for germination, and as of the date of this report, 300 of the 343 vegetable seed samples have been tested, with 8 seed samples failed label claims for germination. Failures were not retested because of insufficient amounts of seed. None of the vegetable samples contained weed contaminants in 2012. Lawn seeds are tested for both germ ination and purity. Of the 7 lawn seed samples tested, three met label claims for both purity and germination. Three samples failed purity analysis and one sample failed claims for both germination and purity. No lawn samples contained noxious weed seed s. Of the 10 crop seed samples tested, eight samples met label claims for purity and germination and two samples failed: one failed purity and one failed both purity and germination. No noxious weeds were identified in the samples. A Station Technical B ulletin will be written to report the findings of this year's results. Impact: Results of seed tests conducted by Station staff are reported to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has the authority to stop the sale of product s that do not meet label claims or contain noxious weeds. In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchasing inferior seed and ensures that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. The long -term benefit of the seed testing program is to minimize the unintentional introduction of noxious weed seeds that could potentially impact crops of economic importance and the state's ecosystem. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection During the year, Dr. Li and Ms. Inman examined 29 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. Samples for 2012 National Nursery Survey and Trace -Forward and Trace -Back Surveys for Phytophthora ramorum The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 179 Connecticut continued to participate in a national survey of nurseries to assess the presence of the Ramorum Blight (Sudden Oak Death) pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum , in our state for 2012. The objective is to survey nurseries at risk of harboring or distributing P. ramorum- infected plants. Drs. Douglas and Marra supervise the USDA- mandated assays for testing. During the past year, Dr. Victoria Smith (Deputy State Entomologist) supervised the collection of 180 samples by CAES nursery inspectors. After the ELISA pre- screen for all Phytophthora species, 33% of the samples tested positive. This represented a significant decrease in Phytophthora -species positive samples when compar ed with the last three years of conducting national surveys when levels exceeded 75%. DNA was extracted from ELISA-positive samples and tested for P. ramorum . At the time of this publication, no samples tested positive for P. ramorum in the 2012 nursery survey. Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Information Office Drs. Li and Douglas, assisted by Ms. Inman , answered 5295 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizens. Although the majority of inquiries were on ornamentals, trees, and shrubs (66%), other categories, such as food crops (17%) and turf grasses (4%), were also well represented. A moderate percentage of inquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (13%), which included identification of plants and poison ivy control and identification. Although the majority of inquiries were from Connecticut homeowners (60% ), there were many inquiries from commercial growers and plant care professionals (29%). Inquiries from cooperative extension, health, news, and agricultural personnel (11%) remained consistent with previous years. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 39% of the questions came in by phone, 12% came in by mail, 5% came as email, and 44% were brought in person. The number of physical samples handled by the PDIO (56%) continued to exceed the number of phone calls (39%)\u2014 this is a trend that has been observed for the past 3 years. 438 letters and email messages with attached files of fact sheets were sent from the PDIO. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters, since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxicity, and control of poison ivy and other poisonous plants, identification of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health and environmental concerns. Additional inquiries from stakeholders Dr. Anagnostakis answered 246 questions, tested 147 samples, and made 15 site visits. Dr. Elmer answered 15 questions, and tested 9 samples, and made 10 site visits. Dr. Ferrandino answered 12 questions, tested 25 samples, and made 18 site visits. Dr. Marra answered 2 questions, tested 1 sample, and made 1 site visit. Impact: During the period covered by this Report, over 6365 Connecticut residents had plant disease problems accurately diagnosed by members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. In many cases, the plant health problems diagnosed did not require fungicides for control, contrary to the initial 180 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 perception that fungicides would be required. Staff worked closely to educate profession als and homeowners to develop disease management programs that were compatible with the environment that incorporated cultural practices, sanitation, and genetic resistance prior to pesticide use. Accurate diagnosis of plant health problems, educated citizenry, and implementation of integrated disease management strategies reduce pesticides introduced into the environment and water of Connecticut. MEETINGS ORGANIZED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Meetings and Workshops Dr. Wade H. Elmer co-sponsored two Bedding Plant Meetings with Ms. Leanne Pundt and Dr. Richard McAvoy of the University of Connecticut. Topics included \"Update on Managing Insects and Mites on Spring Crops,\" \"Update on Nutrition, Chemical Growth Regulators, and other Production Tips,\" \"Update on Emerging Diseases, Nutrition, and New Fungicides for Spring Crops,\" and \"Update on Pesticide Safety.\" On 7 February 2012 the meeting was held at the Tolland Cooperative Extension Center in Vernon, CT and on 14 February 2012 the meeting was held at the University of Connecticut, Torrington campus, in Torrington, CT. Dr. Wade Elmer organized an AgriScience Fair in Jones Auditorium for high school students in Future Farmers of America (FFA). Over 40 high school students presented their science projects, which were judged by several CAES staff members. (11 May 2012) Lockwood Lectures Dr. Robert Marra organized a Lockwood Lecture by Dr. David R. Houston, principal plant pathologist (retired) US Forest Service, Forest Insect and Disease Laboratory, Hamden, CT. Dr. Houston is an internationally recognized authority on beech bark disease. The title of the lecture was Beech Bark Disease: Biology, Ecology, and Forest Responses. A Five-Decade Quest for Understanding. ( 23 May 2012) Conference Organizing Dr. Robert E. Marra served on a Steering Committee for Connecticut Conference on Natural Resources from 2005 to present. The Conference was held this year on Monday, 12 March 2012, at the University of Connecticut, Storrs. The conference was attended by 210 people, including scientists from CAES. Dr. Robert E. Marra served on the three-person organizing and arrangements committee (and the only local person) for the annual meeting of the Mycological Society of America in New Haven, at the Omni Hotel, at CAES, and at Yale University. (13 - 18 July 2012) The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 181 VALLEY LABORATORY Scientists at the Valley Laboratory conduct multidisciplinary research on insects, diseases, soil nutrition, mycology, integrated pest management and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut. The Valley Laboratory, located in Windsor Connecticut, was originally established by the Board of Control in Windsor in 1921 to conduct tobacco research. While research on shade and broadleaf tobacco continues today, the mission of the research unit has greatly expanded to reflect the diverse agriculture present in the State. In addition to research, scientists and staff diagnose insect and plant health problems, test soils for fertility and structural analyses, conduct outreach to growers and homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host informational meetings, and assist students. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Activities on the farm: There were a total of 51 experimental plots at the Windsor farm during the past year. Five Windsor -based scientists had 23 of these plots; six New Haven -based scientists and a University of Connecticut graduate student were using 17 plots. The remaining plots were maintained by the Farm Manager as rotation crops or for seed collection. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiment s in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields and State forests. Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and his equipment ready and in excellent shape. He expertly maintained the many 182 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 field plots and addressed the specific needs of each scientist. He and his summer research assistants did an outstanding job maintaining the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Mr. Preste and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effort to comp ly with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pesticides and organized and conducted training sessions for the staff. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) Research Biological control using imported predators of the adelgid is a major long- term national strategy for reducing the impact and spread of invasive hemlock woolly adelgid threatening eastern hemlocks. Sasajiscymnus inating from the Pacific Northw est are the primary biological control agents released for HWA management. Projects 1 & 2 are funded by the USDA Forest Service and project 3 was funded by USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service - Plant Pest Quarantine (USDA APHIS -PPQ). 1) Project: Development of artificial diets for predators of hemlock woolly adelgid Dr. Carole Cheah, in collaboration with Dr. Allen Cohen of North Carolina State University, Insect Rearing Program, and supported by the USDA Forest Service, continued to test an artificial diet and/or supplement developed by Dr. Cohen. The optimal diet is to augment and improve the mass-rearing and production of adelgid predators, S. tsugae and L. nigrinus , for implementation of biological control in infested hemlock forests. Currently all mass rearing of predators requires healthy HWA -infested foliage. Supplies of the latter are unpredictable and of variable quality and affected by drought, winter extremes and accessible collection areas. HWA quality and quantity deficiencies often result is high mortalities of predators reared under laboratory conditions. Artificial egg diets developed by Dr. Cohen have resulted in equal or superior results to existing diets used for emergency feeds for HWA adult predators, S. tsugae and L. nigrinus , when abundant, high quality developing adelgids are not available. In 2011-2012, the optimal egg diet developed by Dr. Cohen and tested by Dr. Cheah (called CC diet) again promoted high survival and reproductive function of adul t S. tsugae and L. nigrinus in laboratory settings when used as a dietary supplement to natural prey rearing. The optimal CC diet in alginate form was also able to sustain S. tsugae adults on diet alone for 6 weeks with 96% survival during the summer. Weight measurements indicated that females gained weekly weights on diet alone as compared to adults main tained on dormant sistens first -instar adelgids. Adults also fed on CC diet packaged in stretched parafilm pierced with feeding holes. This form of packaging reduced the need to refresh diets every 2 days after dessication. Packaged diets had a longer shelf life of about a week or more. In addition, newly - emerged adult S. tsugae could be maintained on CC diet alone in alginate form for 7 weeks, maintaining or increasing weights on diet alone without mortality. Both females and males were subsequently reproductive 2 weeks later on return to HWA. Similarly, adult L. nigrinus in spring 2012 were able to be sustained on CC diet alone for 6 weeks with 75% survival and showed preference over a commercial supplement in choice trials by 2:1. In comparison, survival of L. nigrinus on the commercial supplement only was highly inferior to that on CC diet with 86% mortality by day 11. Some L. nigrinus adults were reproductive on return to HWA after a prolonged period on diets only. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 183 S. tsugae and L. nigrinus feeding on alginate forms of CC diet Impact: For large scale mass rearing of HWA predators, artificial diets should result in significant economic savings in production, and enhanced survival of adult predators during holding periods prior to release. The optimal formulations are being provided to 5 federally supported rearing programs and insectaries in 5 states rearing predator species for hemlock woolly adelgid biological control. 2) Quality and Process Control for production of HWA predators Several laboratories (university, state, federal, and private businesses) mass rear predators of HWA. Often these predator releases have failed to provide the expected levels of HWA control and mortality of predators produced has been high during the rearing process. It is not known if t hese failures are because of 1) inadequate numbers of predators being released, 2) problems in release techniques, or 3) the quality of the predators themselves 4) questionable quality of the adelgid prey used for rearing. The QC system consists of severa l tiers of observation and decision- making: 1) behavioral, 2) biomass and linear measurements, 3) biochemical assessments, and 4) internal morphology. This project is led by Dr. Allen Cohen of North Carolina State University who has developed unique produc t quality control assessment techniques as a basis for improvement of production and process control for mass- rearing of HWA predators, in collaboration with Dr. Cheah . In 2011 -2012, biochemical analyses and biomass measurements conducted by Dr. Cohen were expanded to quantify the quality of individual adelgids from various sites. Adelgids and the condition of hemlocks collected were rated for their quality visually by Dr. Cheah as part of the quality analyses. The initial analyses indicate that quality of adelgids is variable and may be a major factor influencing the rearing success and fitness of predators. Weight measurements of individual S. tsugae adults by Dr. Cheah indicated that weights varied with the stage and quality of the adelgid stage provid ed and also with the reproductive state of individuals. Parallel biochemical analyses and dissections by Dr. Cohen with measurements of biological parameters such as weights, oviposition, fecundity, sex ratios, were also conducted in spring 2012 by Dr. Cheah for field collected L. nigrinus from the Pacific Northwest and North Carolina for comparisons with lab- reared L. nigrinus and S. tsugae from South Carolina. Impact: The Quality Control system being developed will enable early detection and correction o f production and quality problems with the objective of optimizing the efficiency of predator production and biological control of HWA in mass rearing insectaries. 184 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 3) Project: Establishment of a HWA predator field insectary A field insectary at the Lock wood Farm was established by Dr. Cheah with staff of the Lockwood Farm of plantings of HWA-tolerant species of western, mountain and northern and southern Japanese hemlocks in May 2009. The objective is to develop a novel procedure for eventually field - rearing S. tsugae acclimated to the northeast climate for biological control releases. The fourth year of planting has yielded valuable data on the adaptation and survival of each species during highly variable Connecticut winters and summers. After the harsh and snowy winter of 2011, northern Japanese hemlock, Tsuga diversifolia , again proved to be the most hardy and adapted of the 4 species to the Connecticut climate. No top -kill of foliage was recorded for T. diversifolia exposed above the snowline while both western and mountain hemlocks had high levels of defoliation and tip dieback. Southern Japanese hemlock seedlings, which were planted as much smaller plugs in 2009, were totally protected by snow cover and survived but did not grow well during 2011 and 2012. Overall survival of the original T. sieboldii seedlings was the lowest at 36%. However, a new planting of much larger saplings of T. sieboldii were obtained from North Carolina and planted in the fall of 2011 to replace dead seedlings, with 100% survival into summer 2012. Survival of western hemlocks was good over the mild winter of 2012 and healthy new growth was recorded in 2012 but overall, survival over 4 years was at 48%. Mountain hemlocks survived (63%) but produced little new growth in 2012. However, Tsuga diversifolia has exhibited superior survival (100%) and produced vigorous new growth in 2012 and is the most adapted and established of the 4 species for Connecticut climates. Impact: Northern Japanese hemlock would be a suitable landscape/garden alternative to the threatened native eastern hemlock which is susceptible to HWA, and should be of commercial interest to specialty nurseries. Hemlock plot at Lockwood Farm June 2012 MILE -A-MINUTE WEED 1) Diet development for biological controls of invasive weeds Mile-a-minute weed, Persicaria perfoliata, (MAM) originates from Asia, was first discovered in eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is classified as a noxious invasive weed in Connecticut. Infestations are found in 9 eastern states and the first record of MAM in Connecticut was in 1997 in Greenwich. In Connecticut, 26 towns are currently infested. This rapidly growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quickly forms dense thi ckets which overwhelm and displace native vegetation and reduces plant diversity. An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 185 imported from central China, has been successfully reared and released for biological control of this invasive species in the Mid -Atlantic and southern New England states. 1) Diet development for biological controls of invasive weeds Weevil rearing is currently dependent on intensive greenhouse propagation of the vine and the development of an artificial diet for mass rearing would be beneficial in improving winter storage survival of adults, reducing space required for mass production and enhancing survival during shipments. Dr. Cheah has collaborated with Dr. Allen Cohen, North Carolina State University, on the development of an artificial diet for R. latipes in cooperation with the Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory (PABIL), New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Trenton, NJ, with funding support from the USDA Forest Service. In 2011-2012, adult R. latipes were attracted to feed robustly in the fall and winter on an improved artificial diet developed by Dr. Cohen using novel extraction methods. Dr. Cheah recorded survival of 44% over 96 days on the Cohen artificial MAM diet alone and improved on diet presentation and shelf life using a new packaging technique. However, there was no oviposition during the diet only period but mating was observed. However, weevils were able to feed and oviposit normally on return to MAM foliage in late February for several months. In spring 2012, a repeat of this diet only experiment with new gel formulations used newly emerged weevils about 1 week old. After 24 days on diet alone, 90% of weevils were still alive but while mating was observed, no eggs were deposited during the diet only phase of the trial, even when minimal MAM plant stimuli were provided. Oviposition was observed by the majority of test weevils just one week after return to MAM foliage. Adult R. latipes feeding on packaged Cohen artific ial MAM diet Impact: A suitable artificial diet for R. latipes adults would enhance winter storage of weevils produced during mass rearing for biological control in many states. Currently, winter survival during the storage phase without supplements is around 20%. 2) Implementation of Biological Control of Mile -a-Minute Weed in Connecticut This project is funded by USDA Forest Service and USDA APHIS PPQ in cooperation with the University of Delaware and New Jersey Department of Agriculture Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory. Dr. Carole Cheah , in collaboration with Donna Ellis from the University of Connecticut and Dr. Todd Mervosh of the Valley Laboratory, released an additional 5,600 R . latipes in Connecticut in June 2012, with re leases in 4 new areas and one new town, Wilton. The weevils have been released to control MAM in North Haven, Greenwich, Newtown, New Milford and Bridgewater (2009), Stamford, Westport and Fairfield (2010) and Sprague and Norwalk (2011). Dr. Cheah has pa rticipated in the releases and monitoring of all the release sites since 2009. Weevils have survived three diverse Connecticut winters, severe spring and summer flooding, and reproduced with multiple generations. High 186 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 feeding impact has been recorded in the late summer at several sites. Dispersal also has been recorded to at least 0.5 mile from initial release sites. However, heavy flooding during 2011 appears to have reduced populations in some sites. Releasing weevils on MAM at a Connecticut Audubo n sanctuary in Westport, June 2012 Weevils have overwintered and established at all release sites from 2009 -2011 and in a variety of different habitats Weevils released to control mile-a- minute weed in the western and eastern portions of the state are starting to impact and reduce local populations of MAM at several release sites Establishment of biocontrols for mile-a-minute weed would provide a natural control to limit spread and range expansion of a noxious and prolific invasive weed, and reduce the need for chemical control, especially in watershed areas, in utility right -of ways etc. Impact: Establishment of biocontrols for mile-a-minute weed would provide a natural control to limit spread and range expansion of a noxious and prolific invasive weed, a nd reduce the need for chemical control, especially in watershed areas, in utility right -of ways etc. C. ELONGATE HEMLOCK SCALE Augmentative Biological Control of Elongate Hemlock Scale Elongate hemlock scale, Fiorinia externa (EHS), an exotic scale present in Connecticut since the 1960s, has recently rapidly expanded its range and population densities to seriously damaging levels on forest and landscape hemlocks over much of Connecticut in the past 5 years. Forest stands in Co nnecticut with heavy elongate hemlock scale infestations have shown thinning crowns and declining health, leading to pre-emptive hemlock salvage in forest management. Preliminary sampling in EHS dominated Connecticut stands in 2010 by Dr. Cheah has indicat ed increased numbers of the twice- stabbed lady beetle, Chilocorus stigma, which is a native and widespread omnivorous scale predator. But C. stigma has not been mass-reared and is not available commercially. This project, funded by USDA APHIS PPQ, seeks to develop optimal laboratory methods to mass rear suitable scale cultures and C. stigma for potential augmentative and safe biological control releases in EHS -affected stands. In 2011-2012, Dr. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 187 Cheah visited several scale-infested hemlock stands for field collections of C. stigma in the fall and spring and is continuing a field survey of EHS presence and densities in hemlock stands in Connecticut. Adult consumption rates of EHS under laboratory conditions were measured. In spring 2012, Dr. Cheah scouted and collected several scale species infesting ornamental trees, woody shrubs and greenhouse plants and attempted their culture on butternut squash. S cale species inoculated to date include soft and armored scales such as euonymous scale, Fletcher scale, magnolia scale, cottony maple scale, elongate hemlock scale, circular hemlock scale and cottony taxus scale. Laboratory cultures of different scales on butternut squash are in their preliminary stages at this time. C. stigma feeding on EHS fall 2011 Impact: Currently , there is no effective non- chemical control of elongate hemlock scale and the range is expanding northwards into Maine. Development of novel mass rearing procedures for C. stigma, a safe, omnivorous, climatically-adapted native predator of EHS, would allow implementation into new areas, augment local forest populations and also provide a method of biological control for many scale pests in plantations and orchards. Insect Management Dr. Richard Cowles trapped spotted wing drosophila (SWD) on August 19, 2011, while monitoring activity of strawberry sap beetles in a grower's field. This was the first detection of this exotic pest in New England. Within approximately 2 months, SWD adults were detected as far north as Maine, and there was approximately $500,000 of damage to fruit crops in southern New England, with especially heavy damage to fall bearing raspberries, day neutral strawberries, late varieties of blueberries, and red wine grapes. Based upon requests from New E ngland cooperative extension fruit specialists, bait was formulated and tested in the lab to be equivalent to one developed by Peter Landolt (USDA ARS, Yakima, WA). The new attractant consists of a mixture of Welch's white grape juice, apple cider vinegar , and lab ethanol. The white grape juice and ethanol replace inexpensive red wine from Dr. Landolt's original formula, which is (1) difficult to purchase with university accounts and (2) is a dark color, which obscures seeing the wing spots of captured fl ies. Drosophila melanogaster , a close relative of D. suzukii (SWD), was reported to be able to taste artificial sweeteners. These sweeteners were tested in choice tests with 10% sucrose; in all cases SWD has a high preference for sucrose. Some artificial sweeteners 188 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 appeared to be highly deterrent to SWD, and may stimulate the flies' \"bitter\" receptors. However, another study of D. melanogaster discovered that their taste receptors cannot distinguish between low concentrations of salt (Na+) and sugar: this was confirmed through phagostimulant studies with SWD. Simulated spray deposits were assessed with behavioral tests to discover the concentration of salt or sugar that would elicit feeding on spray droplets by SWD. A threshold of about 0.1% would work f or either material. The addition of 0.1% sucrose is suggested for growers spraying effective materials, such as spinosyns, on susceptible fruit if SWD adults are present. Dr. Cowles hosted a spotted wing drosophila educational meeting at the Valley Labor atory, attended by twenty cooperative extension fruit entomology specialists from all New England states and New York, March 7, 2012. Spotted Wing Drosophila male. Bed Bug Management Dr. Richard Cowles continued pyrethroid resistance studies in bed bug s in collaborations with Drs. Anderson, Krol , and Ridge. Managing pyrethroid resistant bed bugs continues to be a challenge to homeowners and the pest control industry. Silica aerogel dust is highly effective against bed bugs, but requires contact with the bugs. Oleic acid is part of a healthy human diet and is listed as an EPA Section 25b Exempt ingredient. It was recently discovered to be a necromone (signal the presence of dead insects) to other insects. A laboratory test of bed bug behavior in collaboration with Dr. Ridge demonstrated that bed bugs are sensitive to and highly repelled by oleic acid. We anticipate that the combination of silica gel dust and oleic acid will be more effective than the silica gel alone, because the oleic acid will trig ger avoidance behaviors that enhance movement out of refuges and through dust residues. A provisional patent has been filed by the Station for the combination of desiccant dust and oleic acid. We will continue to determine how this combination may best be put to practical use. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 189 Impacts: Wine grape growers immediately adopted the use of kaolin to protect their crop from SWD, following laboratory demonstrations that this organically acceptable insecticide is both repellent and an effective desiccant that kills the flies. Growers along the East Coast have been adopting the basal trunk spray of dinotefuran (Safari) for protection of Christmas trees from armored scales. Mycology Research Dr. DeWei Li conducts research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on water-damaged building materials, and infiltration of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. Toxic indoor mold - Stachybotrys and Memnoniella biosystematics study: Stachybotrys elegans was reported from indoor environments for the first time. The nomenclatural status of Stachybotrys bisbyi and Stachybotrys sacchari were clarified in that they are invalid names which subsequently have no taxonomic values. The type species of both species have been lost. Neotypes of these two species need to be designated to validate these two species in the future. Impact: Controversies existing in additional species of Stachybotrys were clarified. These results provide significant information to mycologists and biologists about the nomenclatural status of these species which will help with identification and assist in research. New fungal taxa: Specimens were collected throughout the year indoors and outdoors. Dr. DeWei Li published and described two species new to science, Codinaea sinensis sp. nov., Parapleurotheciopsis quercicola sp. nov. Impact: These identification and publication of new species are important additions t o fungal biodiversity and biosystematics. The roles of these new species in the ecosystem and different environments remain to be studied. Indoor mold study: Dr. Li studied household mold and dust allergens and their epidemiological relationship with exposure, sensitization and childhood asthma morbidity in collaboration with Dr. Leaderer's group at Yale. Their results indicated that Penicillium spp. are important allergens to children in households. Exposure and sensitization to Penicillium indoors significantly increased the risk of developing symptoms such as wheezing in asthmatic children. Impact : Collaborations to link exposure to indoor molds to medical conditions is necessary and very important to the public, allergic patients and medical practitioners for protecting citizens, particularly children and adults with asthma. 190 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Boxwood blight : Boxwood blight is a new, introduced disease in Connecticut. The impact of the disease has been staggering; boxwood plant losses have been estimated at $3 million in Connecticut since October 2011. In addition, the concern about boxwood has resulted in reduced or lost orders for other plants, resulting in a multiplier effect on economic losses. Dr. James LaMondia initiated research shortly after the discovery of this disease to determine fungicide efficacy in vitro and in plant systems as a first step in the development of disease management tactics. This research will determine the fungicide concentrations required to achieve 85% suppression (EC 85) for at least 20 different fungicides in vitro. A number of different protectant and systemic fungicides are be ing evaluated against spore germination and fungal mycelial growth rate in petri dishes containing artificial growth medium amended with active ingredient concentrations ranging from 50 ppm down to 0.01 ppm (50, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.04, and 0.01) to determine EC 85 concentrations. Typical fungicide application rates are in the 100 to 200 ppm range. At least 20 different fungic ide active ingredients are under evaluation alone or in combination. The active ingredients represent registered and unregistered fungicides as well as materials currently under development by Crop Protection Companies being tested under agreement. Typically, up to 10 concentrations of each fungicide will be tested using three replicate plates for each isolate against at least two isolates of Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum and conducting each experiment at least twice. Initial results are promising. Fungicides with at least two systemic and three protectant modes of action have activity against spore germination and growth. Range of growth of Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum on plates amended with different concentrations (ppm) of fungicides. No fungicide control on right. In planta: Efficacious fungicides are being applied alone or in combination to liners and actively growing boxwood plants in pots in the greenhouse and at the CAES Valley Laboratory Research Farm container nursery area. Fungicides will be applied at label rates t o evaluate the potential for any phytotoxicity to boxwood. Treated and control plants will be inoculated with the pathogen at the Valley The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 191 Laboratory Research Farm container nursery area under conducive environmental conditions to determine the ability of individual systemic fungicides determined to be effective in vitro or fungicide combinations to prevent infection. The ability to prevent infection will be determined by evaluating plants for visual disease symptoms. Again, early results from greenhouse experiments on liners indicate that disease expression can be reduced by 95%. This research is ongoing and will be conducted over the next year. Our results will be used develop fungicide management programs with different and complementary combinations of active ingredients to inhibit spore germination and also affect growth of the pathogen in plants while following FRAC recommendations to reduce the development of fungicide resistance. Boxwood blight symptoms on boxwood liner. Dr. LaMondia has also identified other host plants in the Buxaceae family. Pathogenicity testing (Koch's postulates) was conducted by isolating the Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum pathogen from leaf and stem lesions of B. sempervirens. Single-spored cultures were obtained on artificial growth medium. Dr. Li identified the pathogen as C. pseudonaviculatum by morphological characteristics and Dr. Marra used molecular identification techniques to amplify a portion of the -tubulin gene from two Valley Lab isolates (Cps- CT-L1 and Cps-CT-S1). Amplified sequences were used in a BLAST search against the GenBank database to demonstrate 100% sequence identity only with other C. pseudonaviculatum strains. Healthy plants of Japanese Allegheny per 10- cm-diameter pot, were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. pseudonaviculatum (1.0 \u00d710 6 conidia per plant) and then transferred to the greenhouse. Circular lesions (1 -4 mm-diameter) were evident on leaves ten days after inoculation. All inoculated plants developed lesions, and no lesions were observed on non- inoculated plants. Leaves with lesions were surface sterilized, the pathogen was re- isolated from at least one leaf per plant. After three weeks, many of the leaves with lesions yellowed and dropped to the soil surface and heavy sporulation of 192 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 C. pseudonaviculatum and microsclerotia w ere observed. This is the first report of C. pseudonaviculatum causing a leaf spot disease on either Pachysandra terminalis or P. procumbens . Pachysandra is a widely grown ground cover suitable for shady, humid environmental conditions that may be conduc ive for the development of disease. Sarcococca sp. had previously been determined by other researchers to be a host of this pathogen. Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum has now been shown to cause disease on all common ornamental species in the Buxaceae g rown in North infecting Pachysandra procumbens The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 193 Impact: The identification of fungicides with activity against spore germination and vegetative growth of the boxwood blight pathogen will lead to the development of effective management strategies. Recognizing that Pachysandra species are hosts of the pathogen w ill remove potential unrecognized sources of the pathogen and remove potential sources of an epidemic. Biochar inhibits host recognition by plant parasitic nematodes. Biochar is an engineered charcoal soil amendment that sequesters carbon in soils and has been associated with increased plant growth and yield. Charcoal has high surface area and microporosity and is a strong adsorber of dissolved organic compounds. Dr. James LaMondia investigated biochar for potential to reduce the bioavailability of hos t-specific hatch signaling compounds in soil. Cyst nematodes hatch in greater numbers in response to unknown signaling compounds in host- specific root exudates. Root diffusates prepared from tobacco or eastern black nightshade roots were filtered and frozen until use. Full-strength or 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of diffusates were percolated though 100 cm 3 pasteurized sandy loam soil or soil amended with biochar (Agrichar, Best Energies, Inc., Madison WI) at rates of 1% or 10% biochar by volume. Collected diffusates were then added to 5 or 6 replicate hatch chambers each containing 15 cysts of Globodera tabacum and the numbers of hatched juveniles counted over time. The experiment was conducted twice with similar results. Juvenile hatch from cysts exposed to diffusates leached through biochar -amended soil was soil ( P=0.002). Both 1% and 10% biochar amendments were effective in reducing juvenile hatch from full- strength root diffusate to levels similar to water alone or the 100 -fold dilution of the root diffusate control, which were not different. Biochar may adsorb host-specific hatch signaling compounds, disrupting G. tabacum host recognition and subsequent hatch stimulation. Cyst nematode females developing on roots. Impact: Recognizing that Biochar may adsorb host-specific hatch signaling compounds, disrupting G. tabacum host recognition and subsequent hatch stimulation may allow crop production without nematode infection and l osses. 194 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Tobacco disease research The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Valley Laboratory was established in 1921 (as the Tobacco Substation), to combat tobacco problems and diseases such as wildfire, a devastating disease caused by a bacterial plant pathogen. Wildfire was event ually eliminated by the development of plant resistance, and ever since, tobacco breeding to incorporate genetic plant resistance to plant pathogens has been ongoing. Plant resistance to major pathogens is the most economical, environmentally responsible, and often most effective way to control plant diseases. The development of plant resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in the 1950's, to ozone damage (weather fleck) in the 1960's, black shank in the 1970's, and Fusarium wilt in the 1980's and early 1990's effectively controlled serious diseases which each threatened to seriously impact or even wipe out cigar wrapper tobacco production in the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently a number of pathogens that threaten the crop. Dr. LaMondia conducts a breeding program to develop resistance to the tobacco pathogens: Fusarium mosaic virus, and Peronospora tabacina (blue mold) for both shade and broadleaf type s. Last year , a male-sterile F1 hybrid 'B2' highly resistant to Fusarium wilt, TMV and the TCN and with moderate resistance to blue mold was released and licensed. Black root rot, caused by the fungus Thielaviopsis basicola has been damaging in recent ye ars with cool wet springs. We obtained three sources of dark wrapper tobacco with high levels of black root rot resistance from cooperating scientists in Kentucky. Crosses and back crosses to CT broadleaf have been selected for resistance and for broadleaf characteristics. Inbreds are being developed for use in hybrid lines with resistance to multiple pathogens. Impacts: The development of a male- sterile hybrid broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco with resistance to most of the major pathogens, including Fusarium wilt, TMV, the TCN and blue mold, should allow sustainable crop production with reduced losses to disease and much reduced pesticide inputs. B2 has been released as a new cultivar and seed production has been licensed to a local company. Proceeds wi ll support further research on plant resistance. Adding resistance to black root rot will further reduce plant losses to disease. Target Spot in Tobacco: In June 2011, fifteen transplant beds of broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum , cultivar 'C9') plants in Hartford County, Connecticut were observed with nearly 100% infection by the target spot pathogen. Leaf lesion symptoms ranged from small (2 to 3 mm) water- soaked spots to larger (2 to 3 cm) lesions. Disease was subsequently observed, also at nearly 100% incidence in a field on that farm and at additional broadleaf tobacco farms from two other towns in Hartford County and one town in Tolland County. Lesions exhibited a pattern of concentric rings, necrotic centers and tears in the cente rs and margins that often resulted in a shot-hole appearance. Some lesions had solani the margins of lesions. Multiple isolations were made and the pathogen was identified based on mycelial characteristics including multinucleate cells, septate hyphae wider than 7 \u00b5m and hyphal branches occurring at approximately right angles, constricted at the base. Healthy tobacco plants were inoculated by spraying with a mycelial suspension (1 \u00d7 10 5 CFU) of an isolate of R. solani recovered from tobacco. After 8 days, the pathogen The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 195 was re-isolated from all inoculated plants exhibiting water -soaked spots as disease symptoms. Leaves inoculated with water alone were asymptomatic. Dr. Vos sbrinck identified the pathogen using molecular techniques. DNA was liberated from hyphae of the R. solani isolate by bead beating in STE buffer using 0.15 mm zirconium beads. Two microliters of the eluate was used to amplify the ITS region. Amplified DNA was purified and sequenced. The sequence was exactly the same as an isolate from Massachusetts that we sequenced in 2010. The ITS sequence confirmed our identification of this new isolate as R. solani anastomosis group (AG) 3. This disease has been p reviously reported on tobacco from South America, South Africa, and the southern United States, from Canada and from Massachusetts. Conditions were very conducive for disease as 2011 was a very wet year in Connecticut. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this disease in broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco in Connecticut. The sequence data suggested that it may have been introduced to Connecticut from Massachusetts. We have found the target spot pathogen distributed across the tobacco producing area of Connecticut. This constitutes a serious threat as there are no systemic fungicides currently registered for control of this disease in broadleaf tobacco. Target spot symptoms on a tobacco leaf. Dr. LaMondia evaluated Azoxystrobin causal agent of tobacco sore shin and target spot, in greenhouse and in vitro tests. Azoxystrobin significantly increased root weights and reduced disease ratings compared with untreated controls, and also reduced the percent of the stem girdled. Some phytotoxicity (observed as fleck) was visible on one or two leaves of Quadris- treated transplants about one week after treatment. Leaves that expanded after treatment did not show symptoms. Activity of azoxystrobin fungicid e in vitro was not as effective as might be expected from what we have seen in field observations and greenhouse experiments. Dose- response 196 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 experiments of R. solani mycelial growth rate on half-strength PDA 1000 \u00b5g/ml a.i. Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), used to inhibit the alternative oxidase pathway in a number of fungi, was tested at 100 \u00b5g/ml SHAM in media to determine the efficacy of azoxystrobin against two isolates of R. solani in the absence of the alternative oxidase pathway. In the presence of SHAM, the inhibition of mycelial growth was over the LD 50 for all concentrations tested, indic ating that R. solani does use an alternative oxidation pathway in vitro . However, the observed inhibition decreased over time; inhibition averaged over all azoxystrobin concentrations was 63.3% after the first 24 hours, 52.0% after 48 hours and only 26.5% during the third to fourth day of exposure ( P = 0.001). It appears that an additional mechanism of alternative oxidation may become active over time in R. solani. Azoxystrobin ( Quadris) is registered for management of tobacco blue mold and should be val uable as a transplant band treatment to protect shade-grown tobacco plants from sore shin caused by Rhizoctonia solani . Impact: Early detection of a new pathogen allows for the development of management approaches and control before the pathogen becomes widespread. Azoxystrobin application early in the season can reduce the development of sore shin and target spot diseases. Fungicide resistance to blue mold in tobacco: Tobacco blue mold, caused by Peronospora tabacina, may be difficult to manage in com mercial tobacco crops despite repeated dimethomorph (DMM) fungicide applications. To investigate whether this may be due to reduced efficacy, Dr. LaMondia compared fungicide efficacy in replicated field trials in certain years from 2002 to 2011 and in in vitro assays to evaluate sporangial germination, infection, and sporulation. In 2002 and 2004, DMM fungicide was as efficacious against blue mold as DMM plus mancozeb, a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide. In 2009 and 2011, however, DMM was intermediate to mancozeb and untreated controls. In 2002, sporangial germination on 1.2 or 12 mg/L DMM-amended media was 87.0% and 9.1%, respectively, of germination on 0 mg/L media. No germination occurred at 120 mg/L DMM. In 2011, normalized sporangial germination on 1.2, 12, and 120 mg/L DMM-amended media was 86.2, 12.3, and 3.0%, respectively. In 2002, researchers in NC, using detached leaf assays, determined baseline sensitivity to DMM was less than 1 mg/L, with no sporulation observed. In 2011, using similar assays, we determined that 37% of leaf disks floating on 1.2 mg/L DMM were diseased, with sporangiophores and sporangia present. Based on these data, efficacy of DMM against P. tabacina has been reduced over time The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 197 Blue mold developing on detached tobacco leaf disks in a bioassay. Weed research Dr John F. Ahrens , Emeritus Plant Scientist, conducts research primarily on weeds in nursery production and Christmas trees and answers grower and other citizen requests for information. Although he officially retired in 1992, he continues to conduct and publish research results and works with growers to help them achieve success in controlling their many problem weeds. His advice on vegetation control is sought by growers and scientists throughout the northeastern United States, Canada and beyond. Dr Ahrens has been a l ong-time advisor to the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers Association and chairs their Fire Safety and Tree Improvement Committees. He cooperates in IR -4 projects to secure national registrations for pesticides needed by growers of ornamental plants. He also cooperates with personnel from the University of New Hampshire to annually update a bulletin for the New England Christmas tree growers. Growers from several states and Canada consult with him for advice on their vegetation control problems. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information A total of 7,074 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year. The majority of these queries (81%) were answered by Dr. LaMondia (2,216 - 90% commercial), and by Dr. Mervosh (2,051), and Ms. Ro se Hiskes (1,530) in the inquiry office. About 55% of the information requests to the inquiry office were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers and pest control operators. 198 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2011- 2012 Valley Lab scientists made 87 presentations to grower, professional and citizen groups, (approximately 3,780 people), were interviewed 20 times and made 225 visits to commercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and private landscapes to diagnose complex problems or conduct research projects. Dr. LaMondia initiated and maintained the Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco growers current with the progress of this devastating disease in North America, and the potential exposure to the pathogen and management options in the Valley. His laboratory conducted diagnostics for 165 nematode samples and was approved by APHIS as a certified pinewood nematode export testing facility. Thomas Rathier, emeritus soil scientist, continued to visit specific urban s ites where community gardens either already existed or were planned by community organizers. At each site, Mr. Rathier made an assessment of the horticultural capabilities of the site as well as the likeliness of metal contamination being found in soils on the site. Samples were taken at each site and analyzed by Mr. Rathier and Mr. Musante (Analytical Chemistry Department). Mr. Rathier subsequently relayed results to appropriate stakeholders along with suggestions for remediation and/or avoidance of soils whose metal concentrations exceed the Connecticut standards for remediation. Soil testing A total of 4,557 soil tests were expertly performed by Ms. Diane Riddle during the past year. About 61% were performed for commercial growers, 37% for homeowners, 6% for municipalities, and the remainder for Station research. Of the commercial samples submitted, 57% were for landscapers; 18% for tobacco growers; 7% for vegetable growers, 8% nursery growers; 2% for golf course superintendents; and 2% for Christ mas tree growers. Diane Riddle was also completed USDA APHIS Authorized Certification Official training. Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. During the past year 15 different groups used the room on 48 occasions. Our most frequent users were the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Connecticut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Invasive Plants Working Group, Connecticut Farmland Trust, Connect icut Council for Soil & Water Conservation, Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers Association, Connecticut Green Industries, USDA/APHIS, Co -operative Agricultural Pest Survey, Farmland Preservation, Yale Forestry School, Connecticut Nursery & Landscape Association, USDA Farm Service Agency. Ms. Jane Canepa- Morrison scheduled the meetings and James Preste arranged the furniture and ensured that the room was available after hours.
