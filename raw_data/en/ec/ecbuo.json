Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) Amazing moisturiser! Its subtle scent is divine and it makes my skin look fresh and dewy. Since I've been using 'gimme a shine' my skin feels healthier and smoother. Everything from the product, to the packaging has been made with an attention to quality! I especially love the aroma!!! I'm so impressed with themindfulayurveda products. I love the fact that they use herbs in their skincare, all natural with excellent quality. This is a light-weight moisturizer, a little goes a long way. It smells absolutely delightful. With each and every use my skin looks radiant, clear and bright, leaving it velvety soft. This moisturizer is rich yet amazingly light on the skin. Absorbs really well and leaves my skin velvety soft. My skin is no longer dry and my skin tone is evening out. I have chronically dry and dehydrated skin and this moisturizer is the only one that has helped. The ingredients are great and leaves my skin super hydrated. I would buy this again. "}
