They have properties that make them particular ly useful in art and technology, almost forcing the thought upon us of a special relation to man. This inner relationship will be pointed out in what follows as it bears upon therapy. In this connection we expressly recommend W. Pelikan s book in which the phenomenology of metals and their essential nature is presented in detail. 17 In what follows, his point of view will be extended to medicine. To begin with, it may appear curious that only seven metals are mentioned in Pelikan s book lead, tin, iron, gold, copper, mercury and silver especially since other metals occur in greater quantities in the human organism. The amount of the material, however, does not indicate the importance of the substance in the processes of the organism. The following table will make this clear. The Seven Metals Earth s Crust Plant Man (elements in %, according to Clarke) O 47,3 Ti 0,33 Si 27,2 C 0,22 Cl 0,01 (dry substance in %, according to Boysen- Jensen) C O H 5-6 N 0,3-4,5 The remianing substances comprise about 1-2% (at times, thought, up to 20%). They are: S, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, B, Fe, Mn, Cu, Si, Al, Cl (elements in %, according to Hackh) O 64,43 Mg 0,027 C 21,15 Mn 0, 3 A relationship between metals and man is evident in the cosmic and planetary origins of metals and organ processes. Memories of an earlier knowledge of these connections can still be found in names such as mercury, which is identical for the planet and the metal related to it. The terms saturnism for lead poisoning and aqua saturni for lead water are evidence that in earlier times the effects of the stars were connected with definite metals, and these in turn were experienced as identical with definite effects in the human organism. On the basis of his spiritual scientific research, Rudolf Steiner has presented the connections of planets, metals, organs, and processes in the human organism in a way that is appropriate to contemporary consciousness. From his studies, insight can be gained into the seven different processes that constitute the functions and organs of the human organism. From this knowledge an understanding arises of the interaction of life, soul and spirit with related physical processes and organs. Before the different metals will be discussed, procedures will be indicated that can enhance and direct their effectiveness, In general, these procedures apply to all metals. At the beginning of a metal therapy, it is advisable to start with the vegetabilized metals and only later change over to the metals or minerals. There is a special form of preparing metals that goes back to Rudolf Steiner. Here, the metals are subjected to a mirror-form before they are potentized. The metal is liquefied from its solid earthly state, volatilized and thereby reconnected to its cosmic formative processes. Not only is an exceedingly fine distribu tion and separation attained through the mirror-forming process, but the metals are removed from the earthly crystal forming forces and brought into proximity with the cosmic forces in the earth s circumference. This preparation of the metals is used when the formation of an organ or the re-formation of the soulspiritual life in general is to be stimulated by the ego. There are processes in the human organism that proceed in a polar way, but such that precisely through their continuous 3 4 working together they create an organism in which man can live with soul and spirit. We are concerned here with seven obvious processes in the human organism, each of which corresponds to a metal, a planetary process, in nature. The therapeutic application of the metals follows this arrangement. Since, in the final analysis, one is dealing with the effects of metal therapy on life processes of the organism, one must consider that an appeal is hereby made in a special way to the activity of the ether body. When the human being is observed without prejudice and to some extent this also applies to animals one can detect processes through which new living substance originates, particularly in growth. Here, the ether body is active, creating and maintaining substance. But an opposing process also exists in which substances continually fall away from the interrelationships of life and pass over to the dead mineral state. This can be seen, for example, in bone and tooth formation. The first process leads into life; it creates living substance. The second leads away from life to death; it creates mineral substances. These two contrasting, truly polar processes continually function in man. The first certainly predominates in youth, while the other, in aging, leads to death. They are expressions of the opposing activities of silver and lead. Silver As the moon is the celestial body closest to the earth, so the dynamic of silver takes hold of those processes that are first to go beyond earthly laws. These are life processes that have a cosmic origin. That they have a field of activity at all and are able to work into substance is due to the nature and dynamics of silver. Thus, the processes of vitalization, regeneration and reproduction in general, all constructive processes that create living substance are placed under silver. This refers to the function of the reproductive organs, whose connection to the moon is still clearly seen in the menstrual cycle, and also to the formation of new tissue generally. In the course of evolution, the female organism, through the development of freedom, has become separated from its rigid 4 5 relation to the moon rhythm. This cosmic connection has never been as strong in the male organism, in which the moon s effect is more functional. It is expressed in an enhancement of crea tive fantasy and general artistic activity. Herein lies the reason why men at least, until today were essentially more productive in the artistic and thought realms; their organisms enabled them to give more etheric forces to conscious processes. In women, these etheric forces remained bound physiologically. This does not mean, however, that this situation will remain the same for all time. According to an indication given by Rudolf Steiner, the wax ing moon primarily affects the vegetative processes and is directed more to the metabolic pole of the lower man. The waning moon exercises its influences more on the nervous function of the upper man. Life can develop only in the watery realm, never in the solid and crystalline. Therefore, the point of contact of the effects of silver is essentially identical with the capacity of the organism to control the watery processes properly. The connection of the moon with the watery sphere of the earth is well-known. The formation and growth of living substance are bound to light since the etheric organism is a light body. It is a silver process that takes up light and leads it over into life. The light sensitivity of silver salts is a final expression of the physical lawfulness of this fact. Organically, the brain is subject to silver and thus to the moon. Its form is completed earliest, and it is actually the oldest organ. Because the formative forces withdraw quite early and almost completely, it is almost dead, exercising its mirroring function by virtue of that fact; this is also typical of the silver process. In this mirroring function perception is made possible. In summary, silver works primarily by enhancing the connection of the ether body with the metabolism. The nutritional process is thereby consolidated and the metabolism, which is concerned not only with resorption but also with building up living body substance, is strengthened. Ingested food is broken down and destroyed in the gastrointestinal 5 6 tract a precondi tion for resorption. The dead products of catabolism must, however, be taken up and revitalized by the ether body. That a living substance is thus newly created is a function of the silver process. It utilizes various substances, such as vitamin A, in its activity; they are its carriers and subsidiary organs. The dis turbances of intestinal resorption that arise in vitamin A defi ciency, particularly the occurrence of dry skin and the altera tions in the mucous membranes, indicating inadequate life processes especially in the watery realm and bordering areas, point to the fact that vitamin A is a carrier of the silver process. This is explained in greater detail elsewhere. 18 With silver, a connection is re-established between the earthly rigidification and the cosmic formation. The organism is loosened and re-opened for cosmic effects, and the precondi tions are created for a partial rebirth from the bosom of the cosmos. The symptoms of silver poisoning can be quite revealing to the relative medical picture of the homeopathic proof. Liquids are not resorbed properly and a tendency to watery diarrhea occurs, as well as tympanites, meteorism, burping, and various gastric disturbances. There are inflammations in the mouth, on the tongue, etc. These symptoms occur most commonly with dry mucous membranes of the mouth, neck and larynx; there is a consequent hoarseness. In animal experiments, dyspnea is observed with final paralysis of the diaphragm and respiratory arrest. Psychologically, dullness of thought, confusion, inconsideracy, fatigue, weakness and loss of memory are evident. Interestingly, time seems to pass slowly to these individuals. Time, however, is connected with the ether or time body. The damage and disturbance of the nervous system can go so far that temporary blindness results. Headaches, primarily on the left side, which is connected especially with the ether body, can occur. The right side is more related to the earthly physical. These headaches can be improved by pressure on the head or by firmly binding it with a cloth; this stimulates skin sensation. The pressure causes consciousness to arise, thereby incarnating man s members more adequately. 6 7 This silver symptomatology becomes comprehensible from the way the members of man s being work. Relatively speaking, the ether body is separated from the totality of organic processes. It does not interact adequately with the substances so that a hardening, mineralizing process occurs, as seen in the drying of the mucous membranes in the upper body and neck and in the nervous system. Liquids cannot be resorbed, which means that they cannot be taken up into the ether body, and they thus pass through the gastrointestinal tract causing watery diarrhea. If, however, water is absorbed well but is not taken up into the ether body and instead accumulates as a result, then that is symptomatic of a disturbance of the potas sium process. Argentum is indicated for these conditions. Since silver enhances the binding of the ether body to the physical, it is indicated when this connection is weak. Naturally, this is true more of children than of adults. Children who unite weakly with their physical bodies and, in a larger sense, with their earthly existences in general, have build-up processes that are too weak. They will be pale, dreamy, often underweight and will look old. At times, the ether body does not join the physical body as adequately as might be appropriate for a particular age. Here, the moon has an excessively strong influence on that part of the ether body that extends beyond the physical. This can lead to sleep-walking but it may also be connected with a pavor noc turnus and bedwetting. Whenever the symptoms depend thus on the moon, silver is indicated. It is best to begin with Argentum per bryophyllum during the waxing moon, and Phosphorus D6 when it is waning. When this condition is carried over from childhood into the adult years, it can lead to constitutional malnutrition of the asthenic type or to a tendency to states of fatigue. Silver therapy is also indicated in atrophic processes in the cerebral area, and for stimulation of regeneration after injuries of the ner vous system. The potency used must be high, for example, Argentum prep. or Nitricum D20. 7 8 Constitutionally, silver is always indicated when the neces sary constructive processes are excessively damaged or limited by an overly strong catabolic process. Said briefly, if Saturn has harmed, Luna will help. On that basis, the application of high potencies of silver in febrile illnesses can be understood. When dealing with a consuming fever in which the ether body is unable to call up constructive forces, silver in D30 can be indi cated, preferably as injection and if possible together with Echinacea. If the breakdown by the astral body or ego is too strong, then silver can drive the astral and ego-organization out of the metabolic and limb system. 19 This situation can also arise after a shock, so that the ether body cannot be rejoined properly to the physical organism, especially in the metabolic region. It can be caused by a psychological shock, an accident, or even birth, causing the labile connection of the astral body to the regenerative organs particu larly to be disturbed. 20 The shocked astral body is then cramped into another region the neighboring digestive tract, for example. Such cramps are frequently loosened by the application of Oxalis alone. Argentum (either as Argentum per compresses of Oxalis, 20 percent externally; one teaspoon to 1/4 liter of warm eater, applied to the body (solar plexus). One thus works directly into the center of the vegetative nervous system, the brain of the abdomen. This Argentum-Oxalis therapy (so-called shock therapy ) has proven its effectiveness in applicat ions to intestinal neuroses, shocks in the region of the metabolic system, particularly the genitals, and also in disturbances in the vegetative nervous system. Since silver supports build-up and regeneration, its use in promoting conception is also understandable. The younger the organism the more its effect is indicated and intensified. If the silver process works on the most delicate substance of the body, the germ cell, then it is the basis for the origin and maintenance of the human form. Vegetabilized silver, Argentum per bryophyllum as injections and liquid, is used to begin silver therapy. In these preparations, silver is potentized by the vitally succulent 8 9 leaves of bryophytes. It is suggested particularly when as a consequence of the excessively active astral body the patient needs rest because of disturbed sleep. A hysterical component also indicates this preparation since Bryophyllum alone is an important remedy for hysteria. It retards overshooting soul forces and leads them over into the ether body. The indications for silver can be characterized by the two words, build-up and excretion. Silver as a remedy helps to attain a balance between both poles, insofar as excessive build-up with inefficient excretion and a stunted build-up with excessive excretion can be treated with it. The accent lies in a healthy life gained from fluid, plastic up-building. Silver leads from below into a formation that is offered to the forming forces of the upper pole, thereby making a proper excretion possible. In the soul, this polarity can be characterized by the two words somnambulism and psychological desiccation. In som nambulic and similar states the etheric catabolic forces of the lower person, whose excretions are often blocked, act one-sidedly into soul life, causing various visionary, fantastic ex periences that arise from this lower region. In the unconscious manner of this region, however, he is also united with the world from which he gets extra-sensory perceptions. This ab dominal clairvoyance, as Rudolf Steiner called it, is inappro priate for contemporary man. Thus, it is pathological and re quires treatment. The predominance of the other pole, a certain desiccation, is more frequent. As a consequence of inadequate anabolism that is at times connected with an excessive excretion, the person begins to dry up physically as well as psychologically. The death processes of the head, the passive, soulless perception and the abstract, imageless thinking predominate in the soul, which thus gradually loses its life. The ennui emanating from the psychological deprivations of modern man is the first result of this condition, and the epitome is found in the cessa tion of all creative forces. The balance between these two extremes is to be found in a healthy fantasy, the actual soul silver process. It leads to new images and formations in the soul life just as the physically active silver process does in the physical body. In fantasy, too, the emphasis is on build-up, which here is 9 10 united with the formative force of the upper pole. Thus during a proper silver therapy, one notices, besides the generally vitalizing effects, a stimulation of the life of fantasy. This allows the thinking to become replete with images again. The combination of silver and sulphur, natural argentite, brings the metabolism into movement through the sulphur components, causes the blocked excretory processes to flow again, and stimulates the build-up of protein. It finds its application where there is a constitutionally weak build-up, cachexia and genital hypoplasia, in constitutionally excessively intelligent, usually small-headed children and also as an intermediate treatment in arteriosclerosis, in stone-forming illnesses, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. It stimulates excretion in the kidneys and in the digestive area. Because of the sulphur component it is less indicated in blond, sulfuric constitutional types than is silver. The development of form that is connected with silver is addressed particularly by antimony s connection with silver; that is, dyscrasite. It is always indicated when a person overflows physically or psychologically, hence, in somnambulic or simi lar states. It helps to structure the blurring memory. In all these indications, it is the higher potencies that are required. Silver, sulphur, and antimony are combined in pyrargerite. Through the silver, the vitalizing sulphur component, along with that of the structuring antimony, is especially active in the genital region and is indicated in chronic inflammations of that area. Lead It is obvious that processes occur in the human organism through which substances are led from the living to the dead state. One can think primarily of bone and tooth formation in which substances actually pass over into the crystalline, mineral state. Without doubt, these substances, such as mineral apatite that can be found in bones, did not always exist. Apatite was not introduced into the bones as such but rather originated from an organic substance. This transformation of living substance into the minerally dead can be designated a death pro- 10 11 cess. In contrast to the lower animals, it is active in man and the higher animals. As is quite evident, however, the shells of snails are formed by a corresponding process that acts outside the actual living organism. But the bone and tooth formation occur within the organism, so that man takes part in this death process. Just as life has the tendency to expand and grow, so an essential aspect of the death process is delimiting. Here the physio logical foundation is given for man s feeling himself separate from the world, and recognizing himself as an I or ego. It is connected with the possibility of thinking. This thought process of separation, which reaches from physiological mineralization into the spiritual, was designated by Rudolf Steiner as the Saturn or lead process. As Saturn in the solar system, so does the lead process in man provide a border. Lead on the earth is the last material remnant of once spiritual living con nections between earth and Saturn. Through it, the oldest and most widely comprehensive region is delimited. Two seemingly contradictory physiological functions of the lead process formation and consciousness are connected here. The strong est and most active growth is found in embryonic life, but this demands a similarly strong forming process to prevent dis ordered growth. This forming impulse acts via the nervous system, which develops first and is predominant in the embryo. To a certain extent, forming means the same as delimitation of growth, which, especially during this time, is as necessary as growth itself. In the final analysis, the forming process works right down into the mineral structure, into bone and tooth formation. After birth and throughout life, the lead process is displaced into the processes of consciousness by the forming impulses, thereby making the entrance of the spirit into the organism possible. We would not be human beings with spirits, but rather beings with body and soul, if these Saturn forces were not there, said Rudolf Steiner. As long as the processes of consciousness predominate, as is the case during the day, aging and the death processes ensue. They increase with age and culminate in death. The polarity of death 11 12 and life is preformed in the human organism. The sensory nervous system contains the oldest organs and life plays a small part in them. The youngest organs that are most removed from consciousness and full of life belong to the blood. The life of a human being springs from the tension of this polarity of the transformation of life into death. The necessary transformation is a problem of the proper point in time. It can happen too early or too late. Thus, a grow ing child can develop well physically and blossom, but the soul s spiritual state will be dull; that is, the process of con sciousness will be unable to penetrate and transform a pre dominating ether body. Here is an indication of a lead process that is too weak or insufficient, and the processes of conscious ness can be enhanced by administering small quantities of lead. In younger children this condition can appear as rickets in which the forming and mineralizing is inadequate. How vita min D can be recognized as a lead process has been described in another place. 21 Plumbum in a carefully administered form is also indicated in rickets and especially in cranial tabes. It is obvious, considering the toxicity of lead, that only homeopathic amounts can be utilized. Then it unfolds effects that can be achieved by no other remedy. Especially in this therapeutic application, it can be observed repeatedly that it is not the quantity of lead contained in the potentized remedy that makes the difference, but rather the process, the dynamic effectiveness, that is freed by potentization. Particularly with lead medications, one can achieve practically the same results with quite a variety of potencies, even with the highest potencies in which lead as a substance is no longer present, as in Plumbum D60. For the symptoms mentioned previously, in which the life processes are too strong and consciousness is inadequately asserted, Plumbum D6-10 is indicated. This can occur in children in which there is a deficient bone formation as in rickets, but it can also appear at a later age when the imbalance of the vitality and dullness with inadequate consciousness is present, or when there is inadequate delimitation against the environment, as frequently happens in most cases of allergies, including hay fever. 12 13 Lead is also to be considered in low potencies when the organism requires calcium, as in eczemas that indicate a cal cium deficiency. Then, occasionally Plumbum given with Concavera will activate the calcium by depositing it out of solution. Here, the profound relationship between lead and calcium, so well-known in geology and chemistry, becomes apparent. In general, lead rules and orders the salt processes. Because of the exceptionally deep penetrating effect of lead on the consti tution, it should be administered only under the supervision of a physician and be dispensed only by prescription. The lower potencies especially ought to be given only for a few weeks, preferably a pinch in the morning and at noon, and then stopped. During this rest period, particularly in children, the positive effect of lead is stabilized with copper. If the treatment turns out to be negative, which will be expressed in loss of ap petite and/or enhanced processes of consciousness such as ir ritability, poor sleep, etc., one can obviate the bad effects by giving Argentum or Argentite D6. Although this lead medication, when given for the proper indications, can yield one of the most impressive therapeutic experiences, it is rarely indicated today. Because children today frequently suffer more from inadequate vitality, and the constitution is more marked by an excessively strong lead process, silver is indicated more than lead. When lead is administered in such excessive quantities that poisoning occurs and the lead process works too actively, a destructive process results that takes hold of the whole organism and finally leads to its destruction. Even in this destructive pro cess, lead demonstrates its relationship to the ego-organization and to the deadening processes, leading into mineralization. Lead poisoning occurs most commonly when it is consumed in such large quantities that the organism is unable to excrete it. Then it becomes apparent that it is one of the most terrible poisons. It presses directly into the region of life. One of the first symptoms of chronic lead poisoning is basophillic stip pling of the red blood cells, a sign of the profound damage to their life that finally leads to hemolysis. Further, hematopor phyrin 13 14 can be found in the urine as a symptom of liver damage and disturbance of the light metabolism. The delimiting character of lead extends also to the iron process, so that iron can no longer combine with porphyrin. Lead penetrates all of the vitally important organs, damages and destroys their epithelia, takes hold of the smooth and striated musculature and destroys the joints. In the muscles, the extensors of the hands are in volved, and their shaking tremor is a frequent symptom. An other point of attack lies in the vascular system. The blood pressure is increased; this is based on vascular spasms and is at first probably more of a functional nature. Finally, it severely damages the intima, causing endoarteriitis and sclerosis. Along with the general increased tendency to spasms, colicky abdominal pains, relatively frequent constipation and dysmenorrhea occur. It is understandable that a patient suffering from lead poison ing feels quite ill; he will be anorexic, anemic and finally cachectic. Asthmatic episodes are an expression of the excessively active nervous system, the dynamics of which are no longer transformed by the renal system. The lung, however, is hardly touched by all this. Toxic effects generally appear somewhat later in the nervous system. First, transient disturbances in sensitivity, which are easily overlooked and may be erroneously interpreted, can be observed. These disturbances manifest as anesthenias, parasthesias (the skin often becomes sensitive to pressure and cold air), neuralgias in various places, cramps including the legs, and visual disturbances caused by neuritis of the optic nerve. There can be transient blindness that ultimately becomes complete. Although all nerves are included in a disturbance that permeates the entire organism, it is nevertheless certain that the cerebral cortex is most strongly involved and the spinal ganglia somewhat less. Of the cranial nerves, the preference is for those of the larynx, the tongue, the eyes and the optic nerves. Thus, one is dealing with an exceptional involvement of those nerves that serve the conscious interaction of the ego in the organism; that is, thinking and speaking. In general, the ego-organization is invaded by the damaged blood and system of movement. The involvement of the cerebral cortex 14 15 is shown in a decline of memory and comprehension; states of fear, melancholic and manic mood disturbances, and finally delirium and dementia are terminal conditions. Here, the ego can no longer interact sufficiently and thus predominates over the astral body, initiating spastic states. Lead dehumanizes the human being. Women with lead poisoning have a tendency to abort; this is said also of the wives of men with lead poisoning. Lead passes even into the embryo, causing an illness analogous to that of the mother. It is clearly apparent that lead destroys its opponent, the silver process, which controls the processes of regeneration, the genitals and their functions. Our time is characterized more by an excessive conscious ness and lead process. It is expressed in a vitality that is defi cient when compared to the man of five hundred years ago, and also all living and thinking is determined by it. The refusal to accept a living perception rather than that of the shadow-like images of our mental life, and the sharp outline of abstract concepts are effects based on the lead process. When they go beyond what is healthy, the death process becomes established in thinking. As a result, one-sided, analytic, atomistic thinking prevails through which the world disintegrates into multiple details without living interconnections. Then thinking is used only to register and establish the various details that are passively perceived through the senses. Finally, the sense im pressions can only be grouped into superficial concepts. The intellectual thinking to which modern man tends as represented by materialistic thinking to which modern man tends as represented by materialistic electrical theories of thought and as characterized by the end state of degenerative brain processes when carried to its extreme, becomes primitive reflexive thinking. Thinking has been narrowed down to a fast-moving automatism in which the rigidifying component of the lead process is psychologically expressed. The ego becomes unable to remain in such a sphere so that one is finally dealing with the reflex reactions of the astral body, a condition that is common to animals: Automatism unites with animalism. Thus, one can frequently observe exaggerated emotional reactions or the drive of an animalistic nature, all of 15 16 which indicate astral reactions that are joined to the dullness and limited consciousness of reflexive thinking. This syn drome can also be found in various degenerative brain diseases, in brain damaged children and whenever the brain has lost part of its formative tendencies too early. This way of thinking described here has become such general property today that its one-sidedness is hardly seen, if at all. In telligence (measured as IQ!), counted as a gauge of spiritual capacities, encompasses only a fraction of the true capacities of thinking. Actually, thinking has potentiality and is extraordinarily multi-sided; it ranges from primitive, cunning common sense right up to wisdom, which is all-encompassing. The separation that is connected with the Saturn lead process brings with it, not only the possibility of ego consciousness but also the danger that the separation may be excessively strong, caus ing the narrowing of a spiritual area that will lead to the exclu sion of other more encompassing spiritual capacities. Finally, only the one-sided intelligence that has been described re mains. Insofar as one is concerned with an excessively strong lead process, it can be met with silver therapy. It is also a problem of education, however, in which man and his development must be placed on a broader basis that furthers not only his isolated intellectuality. Alcoholism is another instance in which lead therapy is indicated. Alcohol specifically paralyzes the ego functions in the human organism. This is expressed in the disturbed upright gait, speaking and thinking in those under its influence. It also releases inhibitions, drives, and cravings that are no longer controlled by the ego, and the astral body becomes manifest in its animal nature. In addicted individuals, there is a relative soul-spiritual weakness of the ego, which, under certain circumstances, may have developed secondarily through the addict s failure to face a particular task in life. Through lead, especially as lead oxide (minimum D3, trit. D6 injection), the predominance of the astral body is delimited, and the ego has again a framework in which to work effectively. Naturally, the remedy alone cannot cure the addiction; it provides only the possibility to do so. It is the task of the 16 17 physician to clarify the situation for the patient and to activate his personality so that he can use the offered help, practicing the control over his astral body by his ego. Lead therapy is also indicated for sclerosis. Rudolf Steiner suggested a pharmaceutical modification of lead for this; that is, Plumbum mellitum. To produce this, lead is processed in a special way with honey, sugar, and warmth. The connection with the ego-organization is established through the sugar; the activity of the lead is harmonized thereby and its one-sidedness is expanded. In arteriosclerosis in particular, one is dealing with an inadequate breakdown of vital substances that are subjected to a hardening and deposition process rather than being broken down and excreted. Therapeutically, it is much more meaningful than the overvalued control of the consumption of cholesterol to stimulate the organism to process this necessary physiological product in the right way. Frequently the entire physical organization becomes too dense, resulting in disordered salt processes and the most varied depositions. These can be approached naturally in many ways, for example, with formica, through which a re membering, a re-integration of the rigidified life back into the life cycle can result. Belladonna also works against this tendency to woodenness. It is essential, however, that these substances are subjected to a breakdown process and that maturation occurs properly so that it is connected with the aging process. Then they are led further (for example, cholesterol broken down into bile acids and excreted) and do not enter the region of the deposition processes. The inadequate breakdown process that underlies arteriosclerosis is specifically approached by Plumbum mellitum. As Sclerone (Plumbum mell. D12), it is used above all for prophylaxis. For the actual therapy, the higher potencies are more favorable (Plumbum Mell. D20) and may be supported by Arnica, Belladonna, Formica, and Betula folium. At times, silicic acid lead, Plumbum silicium, may work better than Plumbum mellitum, or also naturally oc curring barysilite, as trituration or injection in higher potencies. This can be used especially when consciousness is flooded 17 18 by an excessively strong metabolism and one wants to appeal to the forming and enlightening activity emanating from above. Furthermore, Plumbum silicium can also be used in morbus Scheuerman to affect bone formation and structure with silica. Once again, it must be pointed out that lead ought not to be used continuously. The prophylactic use of Sclerone should also proceed for 4-6 weeks and be followed by pauses of 2-4 weeks. Such cures should not be continued uninterruptedly. Sclerone is actually a geriatricum that is unique in its conception and activity. The principles of most geriatrics are based on the stimulation of declining vitality or the substitution of hormones, vitamins, trace minerals, etc. Development is not turned back by Sclerone, but rather a step forward is encouraged. The organism is assisted through the physiological metamor phoses of the formative forces that normally occur in aging, and that helped to unfold a free spiritual life instead of remain ing in the biological realm. Thus, an active, encompassing, comprehensive spiritual life is the best prophylaxis against sclerosis. The mildest application of lead is in the form of an ointment (Plumbum 0.1% unguentum) and it is primarily considered for local application in the treatment of cranial tabes. Furthermore, according to the principle of the vegetabilized metals, lead therapy can also be guided by the appropriate plant. Here can be named Plumbum per chicorium, through which the lead process is introduced into catabolism. It is indicated at the beginning of a lead therapy as well as in problems of fermenta tion and breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract as it is occa sionally found in children as an expression of inadequate metabolic penetration. If only silver and lead processes were active in man, his organism could unfold only between life and death. There would be no foundation for a conscious soul or spiritual activ ity. Other processes are necessary for that, and they act in such a way that a soul-spiritual activity extending right into the liv ing substance is possible. This happens above all through the copper and iron processes to be discussed further on. In keep ing with their nature, these are completely different from 18 19 purely biological life. In nature, one can find a process whose specific task is to mediate, to combine opposites and bring them together. Mercury The substances that are only biologically vitalized by the silver process must be put in the service of the entire organism and led over into the higher members of man s being. They must not be allowed to unfold their own lives, which would be unformed and undifferentiated, because they would be free of the organism s control. The process that brings this about is identical with mercury. It has been seen to contain mediating and combining forces since ancient times. Mercury, the messenger of the gods, medi ates between heaven and earth, between the higher spiritual beings and man, and generally between the different spheres. In ages past, this world force that is active in the cosmos and man and experienced as actively emanating from the higher worlds was seen as the god Mercury. Mercury was the god of the merchants because it was their task to make adjustments between areas of abundance and deficiencies. In a higher sense this is actually a healing activity, which explains why Mercury was also the god of physicians. The original principle of healing lies in the adjustment of illnesses. Often, only a defi cient or elevated blood value, etc., can be determined, but in many instances a correspondence can be found in another area. A deficiency of calcium in the blood, for instance, corre sponds to an excessive irritability of the nervous system; in cir rhosis of the liver, which is a drying out and hardening of an essentially watery organ, too much water is found in the wrong place, as in ascites. The vitality that the diabetic lacks in his nervous system can be found in the wrong place and underlies furunculosis. The excessive growth of a tumor brings about a decreased vitality of the organism. True healing will strive to remove what is excessive and also to put it in its rightful place. An important principle of healing is contained in the mercury process because of the inadequate mediation that underlies many illnesses. There is substantially 19 20 too much of something in one place that is deficient in another, causing congestions. The mercury process dissolves these and brings movement into stagnation. The metal mercury is the representative of this process and, in its purest form, shows it. It is understandable that not all disturbances can be treated with mercury, but this metal and its dynamics express the essence of the process. (Occasionally the disturbing congestion is caused by a deficiency that cannot be mediated by the mercury process and may, therefore, lie in the realm of the silver or copper processes.) The essence of mediation consists in the mediator having access to and relationships with the contrasts. It must have the properties of both extremes and must partake in them. If the mercury process is to carry life further, then it must be related to life and to its carrier, water. Through its liquid state and its striving to form drops, mercury shows its relationship to water; it also shows a direct tendency toward the living. Mercury easily forms a soluble combination with protein in the presence of salt. It strives to life, taking hold of the life pro cess and guiding it into a higher level. Its well-known disinfec tive properties, for example, as a sublimate used to kill lower life forms such as bacteria, is based on that activity. In man, the area of the mercury process is there where separating processes are formed in the organism that must again be taken into relationships with the total organism. 22 Life processes that have become separated from the overall function of the organism are found in malignancies. Here, cells as living formed entities come to lead their own lives outside the borders and laws of the organism. True healing of such conditions consists not only in removing or destroying the exuberant growth but also in guiding it back into the totality of the organism. This is a truly mercurial therapy, and this goal is striven for through treatment with mistletoe. Catarrhs are also examples of separations from the ruling forces of the organism. An organ that has been affected by cold is not permeated properly and so a catarrh becomes manifest. 20 21 Through mercury the excretions can again be integrated and reabsorbed. The sulphur combination, cinnabar, is particularly effective in these cases. The intensive connection of mercury with life and its ten dency to take hold of it and carry it further are also the bases for its great toxicity. As a substance it is able to permeate the whole organism, passing from the mother to the embryo and to the suckling infant, destroying life broadly, especially where there are physiological transitions to dead mineral substances (periodontal disease, dental decay, and falling teeth). The nervous system with its decreased life is particularly endangered in chronic mercury poisoning. Tremor mercurialis develops, and later, polyneuritis, pseudotabes and its symptomatology of paralysis adjutans. Here we point to the polar metal stannum; in the potency of D6 to D10 it can arrest the effects of mercury, It is a task of the glandular system, which is subordinated to the mercury process, to extend and permeate the living liquid substances with structure. Thus, all glandular organs can be affected with mercury, especially insofar as they are connected with the watery, mucoid processes, and this partly includes the nutritional. The absorbed, newly vitalized stream of nutri tion enters the lymphatic system, the region below the blood, by way of the portal vein to the liver, where the actual forma tion of human substance takes place. This process of media tion, this taking from the intestine into the blood in which the venous circulation is dominant is subordinated to the mer cury process. Thus, all disturbances of the glands as well as the lymphatic system and a part of the venous storage are indications for mercury therapy. Mercury rules the watery swellings, congestions, inflammations, and catarrhs in the gastrointestinal tract, and also the tonsils and mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and ears. The sulphur combination, cinnabar, is particularly indicated in chronically recurrent catarrhal states in the neck and sinus areas (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, Cinnabar D20 tablets). 21 22 Mercury cyanide goes back to a recommendation of V. Villars for diphtheria a stroke of genius! With this therapy the toxic components found in diphtheria are specifically attacked. It has proved to be of excellent help in diphtheria as well as in lacunar tonsillitis, etc., in which there is a similar, if weaker, toxic situation. The lung as an organ is formed by the forces of mercury. It mediates in inspiration and expiration and in the vitalizing and destructive forces. The foundation for a heterotrophic life is given man and animal by this breathing process. It makes possible a higher soul life that goes beyond the biological vegetative life. Thus, one can appeal to the formative forces in the lung with mercury (in middle potencies) and, since the regenerative processes are quite minimal in the upper regions, at least inhibit the destruction that occurs in bronchiectases. A constitutional mercury therapy is suitably begun with Mercury per-bryophyllum. This has proved itself in various compulsive phenomena that are based on the lung. Through the mediation of mercury, the therapy affords man the possi bility of finding a mean. Mercury brings movement into a situation and as Mercurious auratus D15 is thus especially in dicated in psychological imbalance and enhanced sensitivity as well as in rigidified depressive states. Tin 23 Of the seven metals, tin is closest to lead in its physical and chemical properties. It has the same relationship to lead as mercury has to silver, and as in these, the difference is profound, corresponding almost to another being. While the lead process rules the mineral border between life and death, tin, like mercury, is a step above the polarity of lead and silver; that is, above life and death. The realm of activity of the tin process is not the firm mineral state, but rather the half-solid states that are typical of organic substances. It is well-known that salts crystallize from solutions, immediately pass ing from a liquid to a solid state. The same holds true for crystallized sugar; water similarly passes to solid ice. There 22 23 are no intermediate stages or transitions. In the organic realm, however, there are all kinds of semi-solid in-between stages, such as gel, mucous, jelly, oil, cartilage, etc., which are neither completely liquid nor truly solid. Here, the transitional states are especially characteristic. A salt crystal manifests the result of death forces and also shows the corresponding forces that become manifest in the crystalline form. The form of the crystal system is thus determined by the substance. The radiating shape of radiolaria un mistakably reveals silica, while the round snail-like forms of the foraminifers are typical of the forms produced by calcium. Thus, in these protozoa and also in the siliceous, calcareous and horny sponges, in snails and bivalves, the forms are expressions of deposited substances that have been modified by the particular species. In higher organisms, particularly man, this is no longer the case. The bones, for example, are not formed by the inherent formative forces of calcium, but are pure expressions of the human or animal organisms that are better able to shape these forces. In the mineral realm, the inherent forces of a substance produce the form of a crystal. In the realm of the living, it is the building plan produced by the ether body of an organism that establishes the form. Utilizing the appropriate substances, it delimits their formative tendencies, overcomes them, and subordinates them to the higher etheric directives. The semi-liquid state is particularly open to this organizing formative impulse. This forming and plasticizing of organic material comes about through the forces of tin. Wherever this semi-liquid stage occurs, the action of the tin process is to be found. Pure water, H 2 0, is dead, but a living liquid always contains salts, proteins and other organic substances and goes more or less beyond the liquid. This relationship between organic substances and the tin process is most evident in cartilage or the gel state. It is a task of the tin process to regulate and plastically form them. It is understandable that this means a processing of water, but it is completely different from the mercury 23 24 process. It brings water into movement, decongests it and leads it further, whereas the tin process rules water, organizes and forms it, and as organic substance integrates it with the structure of the organism. This form-giving is naturally necessary, particularly so in the living watery substances. The establishment of the properly organized water metabolism is the function of the tin process. The forming and proper amount of water is necessary for the delimiting mucous membranes the pleura, pericardium, joint surfaces, etc. to function. The ex tremes of too dry, as in pleuritic sicca, or too moist as in pleuri tic exudative or pleural effusion, point to a disturbed tin pro cess. In both cases the indicated remedy is Stannum D10, D8, as injection or by mouth. In glaucoma the proper amount of water is also lacking in the vitreum, which shows the typical stannum consistency, and a special preparation, Corpus vitreum/stannum, has been put together to make stannum active in that part of the body. In principle, the same conditions apply to hydrocephaly: Uncontrolled water is not integrated into the total function of the organism. Here, too, therapeutic experience shows it to be pos sible to control this illness by using Stannum D8 injections, D10 trit., and 0.4% ointment or gel on the forehead. Arthrosis deformans points in a twofold way to a disturbed tin process and Stannum is primarily indicated. The substance, consistency, and formation of cartilage are typically affected by the activity of tin. When this is inadequate, it leads to a loss of cartilage as well as of form. Besides other therapeutic possi bilities, Stannum is one of the principal remedies in this disease. Connective tissue as well as cartilage also belong essentially to the form-giving living tissue. Its high silicic acid content indicates its formative forces. The many different disturbances resulting from prevalent and widespread connective tissue weakness, such as spinal and tendon problems, etc., are best approached with Stannum salicicum, that is Arandacite, along with silica-rich plant foods like barley and millet. 24 [What Each Vitamin & Mineral Does In Your Body.
