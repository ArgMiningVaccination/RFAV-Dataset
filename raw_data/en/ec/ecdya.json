(See also [pharmaceutical industry](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pharmaceutical-industry).) Records of medicinal plants and minerals date to ancient Chinese, Hindu, and Mediterranean civilizations. Ancient Greek physicians such as [Galen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galen) used a variety of drugs in their profession. During the 16th century ad, after Western [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine) began to recover from its long sleep during the Dark and Middle Ages, [pharmaceutical](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pharmaceutical) practice began to develop rapidly. In 1546 the first pharmacopoeia (list of drugs and their preparation) appeared in Germany, and the profession of [pharmacy](https://www.britannica.com/science/pharmacy) is considered to have begun in 1617 with the founding of the Society of Apothecaries in London. Among the earliest modern pharmaceuticals were the [anesthetics](https://www.britannica.com/science/anesthetic); [morphine](https://www.britannica.com/science/morphine) was first used in about 1804, [chloroform](https://www.britannica.com/science/chloroform) in 1847, and [cocaine](https://www.britannica.com/science/cocaine) in 1860.

[Alkaloids](https://www.britannica.com/science/alkaloid) were the first pure pharmaceuticals derived from natural substances (plants); they include quinine, nicotine, cocaine, atropine, and morphine. Drugs of animal origin include glandular extracts containing hormones, such as [insulin](https://www.britannica.com/science/insulin) for use in treating diabetes. Antibiotics, vaccines, human blood-plasma fractions, and steroid hormones are other important pharmaceuticals manufactured from natural substances. [Vitamins](https://www.britannica.com/science/vitamin), which were formerly obtained from natural sources, are now often made in the laboratory. In the preparation of dosages, many pharmaceuticals are ground to varying degrees of fineness. Many medicinal substances are added to water, alcohol, or another solvent so that they can be used in solution form. These may include spirits, elixirs, and tinctures.
