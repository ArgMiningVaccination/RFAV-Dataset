Medicare and Alternative Medicine Naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy and other forms of alternative medicine are not covered by Original Medicare. However, there are other services that Original Medicare may cover. For instance, Medical nutrition therapy is covered by Medicare Part B for people who have diabetes or kidney disease, or who have had a kidney transplant in the past 36 months. For Medicare to pay in full for this service, beneficiaries must have a referral from their doctor or qualified practitioner. Additionally, although counseling is not covered by Medicare, you may be eligible for a similar service such as depression screenings and alcohol misuse therapy. As a general rule of thumb, those interested in naturopathic medicine should check and see if a particular service is covered by Medicare or if there is a similar option available.
