Rabbi Margaret Frisch Klein Collected by Rabbi Lior Nevo Blessing for the Vaccine Blessed are you, Vaccine, Holy tool of science, medicine, and health, Secretly, invisibly transforming pathogen to antigen, Antigen to immunity. With each dose, be as anointing oil; Bless us each with strength and power to fight. No mere superstition are you, but the work of will, Curative and creative, Birthed by kn owledge and observation and trial and error, The culminated work of many minds, many hands, many hearts. Child of science and magic, Bless us in turn. Grant us hardiness, grant us protection, Grant us the will to persist against imperceptible onslaught. Do your secret work in our bodies and in our blood, As you did for our ancestors before us. With each moment may you grow into your purpose Of protecting those most susceptible, most vulnerable. Help us to recognize that you are no malefic potion, No plot or plan or scheme; But that you are the embodiment and creation of Love for one another, That you represent the promise of many hands making light work. When each of us who can, takes on this tiny risk, The risk for many more divides, and divides, Until one day, it's gone. May the labor of those who created you be not in vain, May your promise grow to fulfillment, May each of us persist, resist, grow strong with your help. May our losses be eased. May we be inoculated from strife and trouble. Vaccine, work of many, child of many: Blessed be you among balms. Rev.

I am about to be given a vaccine to protect me against the novel Coronavirus which has claimed so many lives this year. I a m concerned. I know this vaccine might have side effects, and I pray for the strength and grace to handle any that I experience, and to accept that all medications and vaccines have potential side effects. Give me the wisdom to trust my instincts and my body, that I will know when to be concerned. Help my mind to be calm and to trust in this medication and its healing capabilities. Divine Healer, I am grateful for those whom you have endowed with the knowledge and ability to create vaccines and medications that can protect us against or slow the progress of devastating diseases.

Rabbi Karen Reiss Medwed Collected by Rabbi Lior Nevo A prayer of thanksgiving for the COVID -19 vaccines Merciful God, hear our prayers for a world that continues to gr apple with a relentless virus, and our gratitude for the light beginning to emerge at the end of a long and deadly tunnel. As vaccines are at last becoming available for COVID -19 and as people begin to be inoculated around the globe, we give thanks for al l whose tireless labors have brought us to this day: technicians, scientists, medical personnel, biotech companies and government agencies that have worked together to find a cure that will restore our communities to wholeness and health. We pray that the reach of these vaccines will encompass the world, especially those places where medical resources have far too often been inadequate to the need \u2014 places where histories of colonialism have left abiding scars and where under -resourced medical systems are overwhelmed by the essential work of caring for those who have been infected. We continue to pray for healthcare workers around the globe who are running ragged after months of high -risk essential work on the frontlines of this pandemic. Grant them streng th, endurance, wisdom and courage for the living of these days. We pray for all who are desperately ill, for those who grieve the loss of loved ones and for those whose physical, mental and economic well - being have been most severely impacted by the havoc wrought by the pandemic. Grant wisdom to all entrusted with civic leadership as they discern and negotiate just ways in which to aid those most afflicted. Move our hearts to put partisanship aside for the common good, so that safeguards against the coronav irus will not be ignored and that our communities may be restored and revitalized. Let us live in the Spirit of Christ for one another and for our world. God, in your mercy, hear our prayers. Amen. Rev. Roger Gench Collected by Rabbi Lior Nevo A Prayer for Receiving the Covid Vaccine I have been praying for this day and now it is here! With great excitement, a touch of trepidation And with deep gratitude I give thanks To all the scientists who toiled day and night So that I might receive this tiny vaccination That will protect me and all souls around this world. With the pandemic still raging I am blessed to do my part to defeat it. Let this be the beginning of a new day, A new time of hope, of joy, of freedom And most of all, of health. I thank You, God, for blessing me with life For sustaining my life And for enabling me to reach this awe -filled moment. Amen Rabbi Naomi Lev y Collected by Rabbi Lior Nevo Prayer for Receiving the Covid Vaccine Holy One of Blessing, I say the shehekyanu prayer for all the big and little \"firsts\" the first day of school the first meal in a new home the first time seeing a friend after months have passed the first night of a holiday Every \"first time\" is a time to celebrate the miracle of life But as I receive the COVID -19 vaccine, it feels like the first time I've ever said these familiar words A shehekyanu of shehekyanus a first that leads to other firsts the first warm hug from a good friend the first coffee shop conv ersation the first in -person prayer service the first standing ovation after the first live performance the first time my hands touch the hands of another I receive this first, this vaccine, in memory of those who died from this disease, the one s who no longer have firsts to celebrate and in honor of those who worked while I quarantined essential workers, medical professionals, those who risked their lives to protect mine. With gratitude to them, and to You, for my survival in this time of death, I promise to protect others, and to bless the miracle of every breath.
