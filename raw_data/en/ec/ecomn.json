Ancient rasayana texts center around the use of prepared forms of mercury (see [samskaras](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Samskara_%28Ayurvedic%29.html)), as do occidental alchemical texts. However, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the ancient science of rasayana; rasayana is in fact a part of [Ayurveda](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Ayurveda.html). [Ayurveda](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Ayurveda.html), the oldest health science has eight branches. Rasayana (rejuvenation) is one of them. Rasa has different meanings like \"taste\", \"essence\", \"flavor\", \"juice\", or \"emotion\", but is not limited to any of these. In therapeutic process Rasa is concerned with the conservation, transformation, and revitalization of energy. Rasa nourishes our body, boosts immunity and helps to keep the body and mind in best of health. Rasayana describes an herbal preparation that promotes a youthful state of physical and mental health and expands happiness. Rasayana herbs have high levels of both safety for daily use and effectiveness. They are given to small children as tonics, and are also taken by the middle-aged and elderly to increase longevity. [[1]](#_note-0/) Rasayana herbs and formulas are often confused with the categories of adaptogens, amphoterics, alteratives and tonics, eventhough they are not identical. Rasayanas affect the body in a general way, i.e . they may affect the immune system rather than the lungs. They are [nontoxic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Nontoxic.html) in normal doses and are amphoteric, in that they won't over-tonify the body. Tonics will build up or stimulate the body towards normal health but can be over-tonifying. Alteratives will help normalize physiology, but do it through gentle eliminative functions that tend to focus on one or more organs, so are quite different. Amphoteric herbs seem to have a built in buffer that will help the body achieve [homeostatic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Homeostatic.html) or allostatic balance, building or eliminating to achieve physiological equilibrium. While all rasayanas are amphoteric, some amphoteric herbs can be specific to an organ and are thus not rasayanas. Both rasayanas and adaptogens are nontoxic, and amphoteric, but adaptogens tend to work on a body-wide basis, by stimulating the [HPA axis](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/HPA_axis.html) and the neuroendocrine system. Some rasayanas do not stimulate the HPA axis or may focus somewhat more narrowly on major systems of the body such as the digestive or immune systems. However the categories tend to overlap and many herbs belong to both categories. [[2]](#_note-1/) [[3]](#_note-2/) Additional recommended knowledge The aim and types of Rasayana Rasayana therapy enriches rasa with nutrients to help one attain longevity, memory, intelligence, health, youthfulness, excellence of luster, complexion & voice, optimum development of physique and sense organs, mastery over phonetics, respectability and brilliance. - Types of Rasayana [[4]](#_note-3/) - Kamya Rasayanas are promoters of normal health. These boost body energy levels, immunity and general health. - Pranakamya - Promoter of vitality and longevity - Medhakamya - Promoter of intelligence. - Srikamya - - Promoter of complexion. - Naimittika Rasayanas help to fight a specific disease. In pursuit of these matters, herbal prescriptions with many herbal substances, preserved in ghee and honey are given. [Chyawanprash](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Chyawanprash.html) is one of the traditional rasayanas. Specific [adaptogenic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Adaptogen.html) herbs are also tested for adaptogenic properties: The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts chebula) were administered orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.... All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation. [[5]](#_note-4/) Rasayana formulas Puri [[6]](#_note-5/) has given detailed account formulas, contain a large number of ingredients, including minerals, pearl, coral and gems, and include a specially processed ( [samskara](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Samskara_%28Ayurvedic%29.html)) mercury (the word ras indicates mercury as an ingredient). Because of negative publicity and cost factor, the use of the classical rasayana formulas has declined considerably, and most of the preparations available now have herbal ingredients with a couple of mineral and animal products. The non-availability and wild life protection act has made the use of musk, amber and parts of wild-life animals, nearly impossible. The current Rasayana formulas are based on such ingredients as amla ( [Emblica officinalis](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Emblica_officinalis.html) which has Terminalia chebula, ingredients. Here are some of the best known rasayana remedies and their modern uses. Since rasayana formulas are general and nontoxic,they are frequently prescribed with more specific formulas that address specific concerns. Nonetheless they may also have specific affinities as shown [[7]](#_note-6/) [[8]](#_note-7/): - 1. Alarasayana (standard formula). Blood tonic. - 2. Chandanadi powder (standard compound). Anti toxic, anti cancer,energy - 3. Gokshuradi Guggulu pills (Sarngadhara ( with [Triphala](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Triphala.html)) - 9. Triphala Guggulu from [Piper longum](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Piper_longum.html)). Samhita). Anti anti cancer - 10. Guggulu pills (Bhaisajya Ratnabali). Nerve tonic - 11.

Rasayana Shastra in Ancient India was much less developed than today. Nevertheless, the use and practice of Rasayana was widespread in Ancient India, and some examples of applied rasayana include paints used in the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Maharashtra state, the steel of Vishnustambha (literal meaning: the tower of Vishnu), and a processed wood sample in the Kondivade caves near the Rajmachi fort in Maharashtra.
