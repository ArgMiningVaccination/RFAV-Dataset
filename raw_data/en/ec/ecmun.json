Whether you are a complete beginner or someone looking for the next step in their well-being journey, these are the best virtual holistic therapies the Bazaar team recommends... For breadth of treatments: Triyoga Triyoga might be best known for its immensely popular London-based yoga and pilates studios, but the wellness company's new virtual service means that wherever you live you can now access perhaps the most extensive range of holistic therapies out there. From free guided meditation on Instagram to on-demand homeopathy, reiki healing and ayurvedic therapies via video link, whatever you need to calm your mind, you'll find it here. For more information and prices go to the [website](https://triyoga.co.uk/treatments-schedule/?where=*&what=*&from=24-04-2020&to=08-05-2020&time=*&with=*&search=true) For art therapy: Masterpeace You might consider mindfulness to mean sitting around doing nothing while you try to empty your mind, but that's a strong misconception. As Masterpeace, a company that is currently providing remote painting classes using Zoom demonstrates, art can help refocus your mind and give you something to physically take away from the experience. Luckily, you don't have to be too artistically gifted to take part as the sessions are expertly guided and provide lots of tips and tricks. Simply rustle up your underused art supplies. Log on and get creative. \u00a37 per class. To find more information go to the [website](https://masterpeace.studio/book/) For nutrition: Urban App Current circumstances have probably thrown your diet into a little bit of disarray, whether you are prone to stress-eating or are simply running out of ideas on what to cook. To help, Urban App is giving you access to the experts, with nutrition sessions rooted in science that allow you to get personalised advice over a video call... no Dr Google necessary. For more information go to the [website](https://urban.co/en-gb/treatments?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=UK_LIU_Nutrition_Launch_V11183150) For breathing techniques: Terrence the Teacher Normally available for appointments at the Harrods Wellness Clinic, Terrence the Teacher knows firsthand how transformational breathing techniques and mindfulness can be; he credits it for saving his life after a health scare. His guided breathing sessions are particularly helpful for anyone who is new to (or cynical about) the practice, as you will immediately feel your shoulders relax and your heart calm. The experience is as enjoyable as it is instructive. For more information go to the [website](https://www.terrencetheteacher.com/about/) For fragrance workshops: Bulgari Parfums You might find yourself turning to the comfort of your favourite signature scent at the moment and there is every reason for that - scent has an almost unique ability to settle the mind. Bulgari has organised weekly masterclasses with the house's expert perfumers, including Alberto Morillas, Sophie Labb\u00e9 and Jacques Cavallier, who will be sharing their advice on how to create suitably uplifting fragrances. For sound healing: Re:Mind Studio Sound healing works by harnessing the perceived healing properties of certain vibrations either through instruments, such as glass bowls and gongs, or the human voice. That's why it is so important that, when done virtually, the sound quality is high and you can feel connected to the teacher even when far apart. Re:Mind's live-streamed classes tick all those boxes and with suggestions to light candles, use comfy cushions and keep a thought-tracking journal to hand, the sound bath sessions are a really rather lovely and uplifting act of self-care. \u00a311 per session. For more information go to the [website](https://remindstudio.com/studio/sessions/resound) For the body: KXU A lot of us are feeling more achy than usual, whether that's because we have recently taken up a rather zealous exercise routine, find working from home uncomfortable or are missing our regular massage treatments. Luckily, while KXU therapists can't currently come help knead out knots in person, the talented team are still available for virtual appointments so you can get the physiotherapy exercises you need to limit injuries and discover ways to treat aches and pains from home. For more information contact [medispa@kxu.co.uk ](http://mailto:medispa@kxu.co.uk) For herbal remedies: Cloud Twelve If traditional therapies have fallen short of helping you with certain health concerns, including fears about your immune system, digestion or fertility, the founder of wellness sanctuary Cloud Twelve, Jenya Di Pierro, could help. Passionate about the power of herbs and how they can transform your health, she is offering her one-to-one herbalism consultations virtually for the first time. In each session, she utilises a combination of Greek, Chinese and Indian Ayurveda medicines to 'prescribe' natural tinctures and teas, while helping you better understand a 360-degree picture of your health and emotional wellbeing.
