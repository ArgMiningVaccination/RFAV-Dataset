When our bodies cannot cleanse, we become sick. It is the same for our emotional, mental, and spiritual health. Physical detox has been well studied and many options are available. Let's explore the other levels: - At the mental level, we may choose a day or half a day of silence; we may choose to slow down for a given period of time; or we may decide not to listen to the news, etc. - At the emotional level, we may choose a particular emotion to connect to. If we tend to be depressed, anxious, angry, sad, or overwhelmed, we may choose to experience gratefulness for a day. It will not cover or bury our pain, but it will help us become more flexible and break old patterns. - At the spiritual level, we may either start a spiritual practice or simplify our current practice. The art of detoxing is the art of creating space. When we trust space, we trust our heart's wisdom. Space will first be filled with a noisy agitated mind, but eventually, we will be able to deeply connect to ourselves and enjoy the quietness.
