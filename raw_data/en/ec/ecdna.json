It has applications in many fields, such as agriculture, food processing, medicine, and the industrial production of biomolecules, biofuels, and other chemicals. The Applied Biotechnology major provides students with an education in biotechnology as it is applied in the emphasis areas of: Industr ial Plant and Microbial Biotechnology (nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, enzymes, biofuels, specialty chemicals, etc.) Food and Beverage Fermentation (dairy products, alcoholic beverages, and other fermented foods and drinks) With this major, we aim to prepare students for careers in sectors of the agricultural, food, and manufacturing industries where interdisciplinary teams address the problem of sustaining the human population under the pressures of a growing population, land use changes, and climate change. This major by its nature focuses on practical solutions, to help the University advance its land -grant mission, and is interdisciplinary, with required courses covering microbiology, plant biology, food science, and nutrition. 5-year projected annual enrollment 1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year 8 19 33 50 67 Source(s) of Funding RCM revenue Nutritional Sciences operational funds (for one -time purchase of lab equipment) Approvals: ABOR Undergraduate Council CAAC Faculty Senate For use by Curricular Affairs: Create approval memo Send memo to college/dept and acad_org listserv Create UAccess Plan Table code(s) (secondary?)

Requirements for Accreditation: Not applicable. Program Comparisons University Appropriateness The Wildcat Journey pillar of the University of Arizona's Strategic Plan calls on us to prepare students for the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR). While previous industrial revolutions were defined by the emergence of one new game-changing technology, the 4IR is defined by the fusion of technologies. Specifically, the 4IR is \"blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres\" (1). Preparing students for careers in the 4IR means graduating students with strong career prospects in the contemporary and future job markets and with the necessary mind- and skill sets to innovate in multi- and interdisciplinary teams. The UA College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) aims to produce employable graduates, by being \"career-focused and not degree focused\" (2). In addition to aligning with the Wildcat Journey pillar of the UA Strategic Plan, this CALS aim aligns with the UA's Land Grant mission of teaching the practical aspects of our disciplines. Further, it meets the needs of the many students who are career- or graduate-school-focused from the onset of their undergraduate studies and are looking for a strong return on investment for their tuition dollars. This includes many Gen Z students, who tend to have a strong idea of their intended career field and look for academic programs that align with their plans (3). Biotechnology harnesses biological processes to develop products that help improve the lives of humans and animals as well as the health of the planet (4) and is a field that thrives because its practitioners embrace new technologies and work across disciplinary lines to innovate (5). In current biotechnology companies, you are likely to find molecular and cell biologists, food scientists, analytical, synthetic, and biological chemists, automation and bioprocess engineers, data scientists and bioinformaticians, and more, working in multidisciplinary teams to bring products to market, as one exemplification of a 4IR industry. For teams to be successful, its members need to be able to communicate effectively with colleagues in other specialties; for individuals to stand out and lead the team, they need to facilitate the integration of the various disciplines. With this Applied Biotechnology major, we aim to graduate students who are 'one step ahead' of many others in their graduating class because they will enter the workforce expecting and ready to integrate their knowledge from different disciplines. We will also offer emphasis areas (subplans) that help students focus on a specific industry (e.g. food, agriculture, or industrial biotechnology) to more explicitly guide them to careers in the relevant industry. In this way, we expect prospective students to view the Applied Biotechnology major as one that provides them with a career-oriented major and prepares them for the 4IR job market. 1.

The proposed UA Applied Biotechnology major is most similar to that offered at UC-Davis, which is administered out of their School of Plant Sciences (this proposal was led by the UA School of Plant Sciences) and offers the emphasis areas of Plant Biotechnology, Fermentation/Microbiology, Animal Biotechnology, and Bioinformatics. The first two of these emphasis areas are quite similar to the subjects emphasized in this proposed UA major. Additionally, the UC-Davis program has very similar target careers to our proposed program. The Michigan State offering is from their Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and appears to be aimed for students interested in more medically-oriented fields (veterinary or human), in addition to the biotechnology industry as a whole. It also focuses on the biochemistry behind biotechnology, instead of the plant and microbial applications on which our program focuses. Arizona State University Tempe offers a Bachelors of Science degree in \"Molecular Biosciences and Biotechnology\". The stated focus on the ASU program is \"the interface between molecular biology and biotechnology\". The ASU program literature goes on to state that \"[t]he interface drives major advancements in knowledge and applied research and development, like the development of next-generation biomedical products or biofuels\" (https://sols. asu.edu/degree-programs/molecular-biosciences-biotechnology). While some courses in our program will necessarily provide students with an education in the molecular biology aspects of Biotechnology, this is not our intended focus; rather, our Food and Beverage Fermentation and Industrial Plant Products and Biotechnology emphases focus on applications of biotechnology in specific non- biomedical industries. The practical nature of the fields emphasized in our program is appropriate for the UA's designation as a land-grant university and will train students to apply knowledge from multiple disciplines. The program at the Arizona State University West campus (BS in Biotechnology and Bioenterprise) claims its students will \"acquire the associated business and entrepreneurship skills needed to develop and market biotechnological innovations and solutions to problems facing the biotechnology and health sciences communities in Arizona, the nation and beyond\" (https://newcollege. asu.edu/biotechnology-and-bioenterprise). In other words, it focuses on entrepreneurship, to help prepare students for the business/innovation side of the biotechnology industry. In summary, our program is most like that at UC-Davis and differentiates itself from other programs by its emphasis on microbial/food/plant biotechnology, rather than the biochemistry aspects (Michigan State), the molecular/medical aspects (ASU-Tempe), or the business side (ASU-West). Faculty & Resources Faculty Current Faculty: INSTR ID NAME DEPTRANK DEGREE Prof Doctor of Philosophy5.00 Additional Faculty: No additional faculty are needed for the first three years of the program. If there is significant student interest in the Food Fermentation aspects of the program, the Department of Nutritional Science might develop additional courses on Fermentation Science and would need to hire additional faculty to teach those courses. However, the program can be initiated and run for several years without hiring additional faculty members.

Physical Facilities & Equipment Existing Physical Facilities: Overall, the facilities and equipment available today to support this major are satisfactory. The laboratory room (Forbes 231) used to teach PLS 340L, Biotechnology Laboratory, was renovated in 2017 and is well- equipped; since 2018, the following major pieces of new technical equipment have been acquired and no further equipment is needed at this time: - A bench-scale bioreactor and accompanying electronic control unit, to allow students to perform controlled fermentation experiments using microbial cultures - A NanoDrop spectrophotometer for measuring the concentration of small volumes of DNA - A plate reader, to take optical measurements of multiple liquid samples at once - A -80\u00b0C ultra-low temperature freezer for long-term culture and reagent storage - A set of micropipettors for each student - Multiple thermocyclers for PCR - [In addition to all the standard trappings of a molecular microbiology laboratory: microcentrifuges, rigs for DNA and protein gels, water baths, plate incubators, etc.] The NSC 3XXL Food and Beverage Fermentation Laboratory course will be taught in an existing teaching laboratory room in the Shantz building (room 101) that has been approved by and is regularly inspected by the Pima County Health Department for food production. It has all the needed equipment except for two temperature- and humidity-controlled incubators, which will need to be acquired (see next section). All other laboratory courses are well established and will use existing, satisfactory facilities.Additional Facilities Required & Anticipated: No additional physical facilities are needed at this time. If there is significant student interest in the Food Fermentation aspects of the program, the Department of Nutritional Science might develop additional laboratory courses on Fermentation Science and opt to build a fermentation 'pilot plant' for this purpose but we do not expect this to happen for several years after the program begins and the program is not dependent on these facilities. For the NSC 3XXL Food and Beverage Laboratory that is being developed in part to serve this major, the Department of Nutritional Sciences would require 2 temperature- and humidity-controlled incubators. We are planning to purchase the incubators (~$27,200 for both) on operational funds of the Nutritional Sciences unit. We do not anticipate any other equipment needs unless and until the 'pilot plant' facility, above, is built. Other Support Other Support Currently Available: Each of the three academic units involved in this proposal provides staff support to assist instructors in numerous teaching- and student advising- related activities. This support staff provides curriculum administration, including course and room scheduling, student registration, and student records management the units' academic programs, and assists the units' Curriculum Committees with new course approval. Each unit has a business office to manage the financial aspects of our academic programs. The Career and Academic Services (CAS) unit of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), in collaboration with the academic units, recently established a centralized support program for undergraduate advising, one that involves placing professional advisors into each unit, and will be available to provide advising for students in the Applied Biotechnology major. The CALS Career Center works with students to increase their employability through events and services such as resume reviews, cover letter coaching, mock interviews, providing career advice, and offering professional development workshops. We have access to the CALS Marketing and Communications group, including their Recruitment team. The Marketing professionals on the team will be able to develop marketing brochures, a landing website where students will be directed when performing web searches about our program/subject matter and from where they can request additional information, and social media advertisements. The Recruitment professionals will advertise our program to high school, community college, and UA undergraduate students at their existing recruitment events, in collaboration with the program advisor(s) and Undergraduate Recruitment Committees for our Units and our program, once one is established. Other Support Needed over the Next Three Years: We will need an academic advisor for the program. Initially, we will either have access to the centralized Career and Academic Services advisor pool or the Plant Sciences major advisor may have part of her position that is not currently assigned to Plant Sciences reassigned to this new major. Based on our projected enrollment, we will need no more than a 0.25 FTE advisor assigned to our program within a couple years of its inception, but if our actual enrollment outpaces our projections, we will adjust this accordingly to ensure a ratio of 1 FTE advisor per ~250 students.

II. NEED FOR THE MAJOR /JUSTIFICATION -describe how the major fulfills the needs of the city, state, region, and nation. Provide market analysis data or other tangible evidence of the need for an d interest in the proposed major (and emphases, if applicable) . This might include results from surveys of current students, alumni, and/or employers or reference to student enrollments in similar programs in the state or region. Include an assessment of the employment opportunities for graduates of the program for the next three years. Curricular Affairs can provide a job posting/demand report by skills 2 obtained/outcomes/CIP code of the proposed major. Please cont act the Office of Curricular Affairs to request the report for your proposal. Biotechnology falls under the broader category of Biosciences, which has been a sector of strong job growth in Arizona since at least 2002 (Figure 1). Indeed, employment in this field in Arizona grew 9% between 2014 and 2018, which was twice the growth rate of the nation (1). Additionally, these jobs provided wages that were 33% above Arizona's private sector average in 2016 (2). Figure 1 : Graph from the Flinn Foundation's Bioscience Roa dmap showing that job grown in the Arizona Bioscience sector outpaced that of other sectors between 2002 and 2016 (2). One of the goals of the Foundations' Roadmap is to increase and improve the 'talent pipeline' in the Biosciences in Arizona. Biotechnolo gy as a specific field is expected to see continued job growth in the next 10 years both nationally (~8% growth) and in Arizona (~8.4%) (3). US Bureau of Labor Statistics: \"Employment of biological technicians is projected to grow 7 percent from 2018 to 2028, faster than the average for all occupations. Continued growth in biotechnology and medical research is expected to increase demand for these workers.\" (4) In the Tucson/Oro Valley area specifically, there are several established biotechnology -adjacent companies, such as biomedical diagnostics companies ( e.g. Accelerate Diagnostics, Roche, and HTG Molecular Diagnostics). There is also ongoing 3 development in this area, such as at the Oro Valley Innovation Labs (5) and UA Tech Park at The Bridges (6), tha t has the potential to increase the local job market in the coming years. We anticipate that many of our graduates might find employment out of state, such as in the major biotechnology hubs of the San Francisco Bay area, Boston, and the Research Triangl e area in North Carolina. In the San Francisco Bay area alone, there are biotechnology companies in the medical ( e.g. Amgen and Genentech), food ( e.g. Impossible Foods, Clara Foods, Prime Roots, and Memphis Meats), and industrial and plant product ( e.g. Genencor and Demetrix) subsectors. Other companies in California that might hire our graduates are the many wineries, breweries, and cheese/dairy product factories there. This concentration of biotechnology -related companies in California might make this App lied Biotechnology major appeal to some of our out -of-State students from California who are looking to return to their hometown with a job -ready degree. Biotechnology is not a particularly common Bachelor's degree subject in the United States, possibly b ecause 4 -year universities in this country have historically focused on the basic biological sciences instead of applied biological science s. However, there are a few universities that have relatively large Biotechnology programs such as the UA peer instit ute, University of California -Davis. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, UC -Davis conferred 65 BS in Biotechnology degrees in 2018 -2019 (7) (Validate reported 52 degrees for 2018 (3). The University of Houston conferred the most degr ees in this field in the same time period: 75 (3). Other institutions that conferred BS in Biotechnology degrees in 2018 -2019 include Indiana University, Oregon State University, University of Georgia -Athens, and University of Nebraska Omaha, which each co nferred 12 to 19 degrees in this period (8). In Fall 2019, UA students in PLS 170C2 (Introductory Biotechnology general education course), MCB/MIC/PLS 340 (Introduction to Biotechnology), MIC 350 (Core Concepts in Molecular Microbiology), MIC 450 (Veterin ary Microbiology), and NSC 351R (Fundamentals of Food Science) were polled via a Qualtrics survey to gauge their interest in an Applied Biotechnology major and minor. Overall, 70 students responded to the survey. Of those, 38 (54%) said they were \"moderate ly\" or \"extremely\" likely to have chosen Applied Biotechnology as a major at the time they entered the UA and 12 (17%) were \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" likely to choose the major 'now' (many students who responded were Juniors or Seniors and thus far along in their current majors). When polled on their interest in an Applied Biotechnology minor, 42 (60%) were \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" likely to have chosen Applied Biotechnology as a minor at some point in their undergraduate education. These data, shown i n Figure 2, encouraged us to continue to plan both the major and the minor and suggest that there will be interest from students in declaring a major or minor in Applied Biotechnology. 4 Figure 2 : Data from Qualtrics surveys represented in graphical form. Responses were sorted into two categories, depending on the respondent's current major (biology -related or non -biology related). The count (not percent) of responses is graphed. The same students were polled on what emphasis they were most interested in and the data were analyzed for students who said they were \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" liked to have selected the Applied Biotechnology major either when they entered the UA or 'now'. For the most part, students selected either an emphasis that was closest to their current major ( e.g. Microbiology majors chose the Industrial Plant and Microbial Biotechnology emphasis) or the less specialized Applied Biotechnology emphasis. Perhaps because relatively few Nutritional Sciences majors were polled and were inter ested in the major (6 of 13), the Food and Beverage Fermentation emphasis was the least -chosen emphasis.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE - describe plans and timelines for 1) marketing the major and 2) student recruitment activities . We will engage the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) Marketing and Communication group, including their recruitment team, to assist with marketing and recruitment for the Applied Biotechnology major. For marketing, we expect to develop the following in the first six months after program approval, in line with what the CALS Marketing team has developed for other CALS majors: A professional, UA -branding compliant brochure to advertise the general information about our major and the prospective careers for graduates o The School of Plant Sciences has an existing brochure to advertise our Biotechnology -related courses that was developed by the UA Marketing team so this may serve as a starting point for the brochure for the major A 'landing page' we bsite, to capture an audience of people searching the internet for our subject of study. The website will include basic information about the program as well as a place to request more information, which is routed to the CALS Recruitment team Advertising i mages for placing on social media An Instagram and Twitter Account for the major 52 o The School of Plant Sciences has an undergraduate student worker to assist with our social media presence For student recruitment, we expect that the CALS Recruitment team wi ll begin advertising our major at their standard tabling events once the program is slated to begin. These recruitment professionals will advertise our program to high school, community college, and UA undergraduate students at their existing recruitment e vents, in collaboration with the program advisor(s) and Undergraduate Recruitment Committees for our units and/or our program, once one is established. We will also advertise our program internally, through the existing courses we are using to form the bas is of our new major, especially PLS 340 (Introduction to Biotechnology) and PLS 3XXR (Food and Beverage Fermentation). This may take the form of a slide that we present as part of a lecture or post on the course D2L sites. XIV. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION -describe how you will recruit diverse students and faculty to this program. In addition, describe retention efforts in place or being developed in order to retain students. While students from historically underrepresented groups pursue STEM degrees at roughly the same rate as their non - minority peers, retention remains a major problem (1). A recent study found that black and Latino students leave STEM majors at a much higher frequency than their white peers (2) and the same is known to be true for Native American and first - generation students. Based on this information, more of our diversity -related effort will focus on retention of students than on recruitment. Part of the reason for the low retention rates for underrepresented minority students is believed to be that these students are more likely to have low -income families, which can mean they do not have the same academic resources to help support them as do their peers from higher -income (and often non -minority) families. Another constraining factor for students in minority groups is likely to be bias in STEM fields and the relative paucity/visibility of 'like' role models who are establi shed in their field (3). To he lp with the first issue, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) currently has a branch of the Arizona Science, Engineering, and Math Scholars (ASEMS) program, which provides additional mentoring and professional development to students who are first-generation college students, Pell Grant recipients, from a group that is underrepresented in STEM, or are community college transfer students (4). CALS also has a First Cats program to support first -generation students in CALS majors (5). In additio n to the CALS resources to help with retention, we will encourage our students and faculty to be aware of the programs maintained by the University's Student Success and Retention Innovation initiative (6). 53 To ameliorate the second issue, we will encourag e instructors to discuss the contributions of diverse scientists to the fields they are teaching about. This diversity may take many forms - gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disabilities, or 'first -generation' status as students, for example, and in that way could help promote retention of all students. Further, we will encourage faculty to use the Universal Design for Learning principles in our required courses, especially when developing online sections (7). By using th ese principles, our courses can be accessible and inclusive environments that reduce the need for students to draw attention to themselves by requesting accommodations and which improve the feeling of self -efficacy in students. To temper 'imposter syndro me' in our students, we will work to foster a sense of belonging in all students, and especially minority students. For one thing, we will encourage the establishment of an undergraduate student club in Biotechnology, to encourage cohesion between students in the program. The club could bring in diverse outside speakers to talk to students about their experience in various careers and perhaps allow field trips to certain companies. In addition to benefiting students in career preparation, having a cohesive club that is well -supported by faculty in the program may also help with retention of students in the program. While we believe that retention -related interventions are critical to foster a diverse student body, especially in STEM fields, we do also acknowledge the role that recruitment plays. Career -focused majors are often preferable for students from lower - incom e families for whom the return on investment for their tuition dollars is paramount. Thus, we note that we are proposing a major and emphasis areas that are by their nature practical and career focused. We plan to keep refining our program to ensure that w e are adequately preparing our students for jobs and the start of a career upon graduations and in that way hope to attract students for whom this is a priority. For example, we may institute an internship requirement in our major, once we have it up and r unning. We will also work with our recruiters and advisors to strongly encourage transfer students from community colleges to apply to our program. These students could complete many of the pre -requisite courses as a 2 -year institution before transferring to our program to take advantage of our specialized 300 - and 400 -level courses, helping them make their college degree more affordable. [We do not currently have plans to hire additional faculty for this major but if we do, we will encourage underreprese nted minorities to apply for the job and will work to ensure that our program offers a welcoming, accepting environment for new faculty, regardless of their background etc.] 54 1.

Most of the information can be copied/pasted from completed sections above. Instructions/clarifi cation for completing the table below, from ABOR, can be viewed/downloaded here . University: University of Arizona Name of Proposed Academic Program : BS in Applied Biotechnology Academic Department : School of Plant Sciences; Department of Nutritional Sciences; School of Animal and Comparative Biomedical Sciences Geographic Site : UA-Tucson Instructional Modality : In-person Total Credit Hours : 120 Proposed Inception Term : Spring 2021 Brief Program Description : Biotechnology is the use of living cells or biological processes to develop products and technologies that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. It has applications in many fields, such as agriculture, food processing, medicine, and the industrial production of biomolecules, biofuels, and other chemicals. The Applied Biotechnology major provides students with an education in biotechnology as it is applied in the emphasis areas of: 55 Industrial Plant and Microbial Biotechnology (nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, enzymes, biofuels, specialty chemicals, etc.) Food and Beverage Fermentation (dairy products, alcoholic beverages, and other fermente d foods and drinks) With this major, we aim to prepare students for careers in sectors of the agricultural, food, and manufacturing industries where interdisciplinary teams address the problem of sustaining the human population under the pressures of a gro wing population, land use changes, and climate change. This major by its nature focuses on practical solutions, to help the University advance its land -grant mission, and is interdisciplinary, with required courses covering microbiology, plant biology, foo d science, and nutrition. Learning Outcomes and Assessment Plan : Learning Outcomes: Graduates of this program will be able to: 1. recall, describe, and interpret foundational scientific facts, especially in the areas of chemistry and biology 2. demonstrate digital and data literacy by retrieving and appraising publicly available scientific data 3. design and perform hands -on experiments; collect, graph and record data; interpret research results; and conclude whether the results support or refute a hypothesis 4. communicate scientific information in oral and written form to both professional and general audiences 5. evaluate the use of biotechnology as a solution to a problem and compare its use to other solutions to the same problem 6. work with others to solve complex problems and accomplish team goals 7. embody and uphold the ethical and responsible practice of science . Assessment Plan: 56 Projected Enrollment for the First Three Years: 1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year Number of Students in major 8 19 33 Evidence of Market Demand: 57 Biotechnology falls under the broader category of Biosciences, which has been a sector of strong job growth in Arizona since at least 2002 (Figure 1). Indeed, employment in this field in Arizona grew 9% between 2014 and 2018, which was twice the growth rate of the nation (1). Additionally, these jobs provided wages that were 33% above Arizona's private sector average in 2016 (2). Figure 1 : Graph from the Flinn Foundation's Bioscience Roadmap showing that job grown in the Arizona Biosc ience sector outpaced that of other sectors between 2002 and 2016 (2). One of the goals of the Foundations' Roadmap is to increase and improve the 'talent pipeline' in the Biosciences in Arizona. Biotechnology as a specific field is expected to see contin ued job growth in the next 10 years both nationally (~8% growth) and in Arizona (~8.4%) (3). US Bureau of Labor Statistics: \" Employment of biological technicians is projected to grow 7 percent from 2018 to 2028, faster than the average for all occupations . Continued growth in biotechnology and medical research is expected to increase demand for these workers .\" (4) In the Tucson/Oro Valley area specifically, there are several established biotechnology -adjacent companies, such as biomedical diagnostics compa nies ( e.g. Accelerate Diagnostics, Roche, and HTG Molecular Diagnostics). There is also ongoing development in this area, such as at the Oro Valley Innovation Labs (5) and UA Tech Park at The Bridges (6), that has the potential to increase the local job ma rket in the coming years. We anticipate that many of our graduates might find employment out of state, such as in the major biotechnology hubs of the San Francisco Bay area, Boston, and the Research Triangle area in North Carolina. In the San Francisco Bay area alone, there are biotechnology companies in the medical ( e.g. Amgen and Genentech), food ( e.g. Impossible Foods, Clara Foods, Prime Roots, and Memphis Meats), and industrial and 58 plant product ( e.g. Genencor and Demetrix) subsectors. Other companies i n California that might hire our graduates are the many wineries, breweries, and cheese/dairy product factories there. This concentration of biotechnology -related companies in California might make this Applied Biotechnology major appeal to some of our out -of-State students from California who are looking to return to their hometown with a job -ready degree. Biotechnology is not a particularly common Bachelor's degree subject in the United States, possibly because 4 -year universities in this country have hi storically focused on the basic biological sciences instead of applied biological sciences. However, there are a few universities that have relatively large Biotechnology programs such as the UA peer institute, University of California -Davis. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, UC -Davis conferred 65 BS in Biotechnology degrees in 2018 -2019 (7; Validate reported 52 degrees for 2018 (3)). The University of Houston conferred the most degrees in this field in the same time period: 75 (3). Other institutions that conferred BS in Biotechnology degrees in 2018 -2019 include Indiana University , Oregon State University, University of Georgia -Athens, and University of Nebraska Omaha, which each conferred 12 to 19 degrees in this period (8). In Fall 2019, UA students in PLS 170C2 (Introductory Biotechnology general education course), MCB/MIC/PLS 340 (Introduction to Biotechnology), MIC 350 (Core Concepts in Molecular Microbiology), MIC 450 (Veterinary Microbiology), and NSC 351R (Fundamentals of F ood Science) were polled via a Qualtrics survey to gauge their interest in an Applied Biotechnology major and minor. Overall, 70 students responded to the survey. Of those, 38 (54%) said they were \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" likely to have chosen Applied B iotechnology as a major at the time they entered the UA and 12 (17%) were \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" likely to choose the major 'now' (many students who responded were Juniors or Seniors and thus far along in their current majors). When polled on their in terest in an Applied Biotechnology minor, 42 (60%) were \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" likely to have chosen Applied Biotechnology as a minor at some point in their undergraduate education. These data, shown in Figure 2, encouraged us to continue to plan both the major and the minor and suggest that there will be interest from students in declaring a major or minor in Applied Biotechnology. 59 Figure 2 : Data from Qualtrics surveys represented in graphical form. Responses were sorted into two categories, depend ing on the respondent's current major (biology -related or non -biology related). The count (not percent) of responses is graphed. 1.
