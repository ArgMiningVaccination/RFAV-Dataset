It claims that our chief problem is neglect of the earth, and that salvation for us and the planet hinges on our repentance. David Walker is absolutely right when he says that 'inasmuch as the \"climate change gospel\" stands... A man has a quick consultation. You deal with the problem and hand over a prescription but he hovers. 'Actually there's something else, doctor... err, I'm seeing this lady and, well, I'm having problems. I was wondering, err, you know those tablets...?' This scenario has become more familiar... In August 2004 CMF was approached by a member about a government consultation on denying access to primary care for failed asylum seekers.

Anyone interested in medical missions and every would-be medical missionary should read this splendid book. Its 28 short chapters (each with evocative colour photographs) carry the first-hand accounts of some two dozen Singaporean medical missionaries and their families over the last 40 years. It is a reminder to any European... Some people claim to have lost faith in God because he did not answer their fervent prayers for healing.

Broken families, abortion, AIDS, internet pornography, clergy abuse, homosexual 'marriage': church and world are in a profound sexual crisis. Is there a way out?

In a climate where alternative medicine has become increasingly popular, Dr Coker's substantially revised version of her 1995 books seeks to explain the range of therapies that now exist and to suggest ways to handle patients and relatives who may request advice on such issues. A good overview analyses... Most Christian medical ethics books on the market are written by clinicians, aiming to provide biblical answers to tricky issues. Sean Doherty's thought provoking booklet starts from a different premise. Doherty is an Anglican curate and has led a medical ethics course for undergraduates, which formed the basis of the...

Joanne, Christine and Louise were all conceived following donor insemination (DI) Having been aware early in life of this, Joanne experiences increasing 'genetic bewilderment'.

The High Court in October turned down her application, but in the light of public interest allowed her to proceed to the Court of Appeal, while making it very clear that her arguments were extremely unlikely to succeed. [1] The parents of Daniel James, a 23-year-old rendered tetraplegic following a... NHS our religion? Diamond celebrations are past, but 'The National Health Service is the closest thing the English have to a religion'. (Nigel Lawson 1992) remains relevant. In 1976 Barbara Castle said the NHS was 'the nearest thing to the embodiment of the Good Samaritan that we have' while by... If you falter in times of trouble, how small is your strength! Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering towards slaughter. If you say, \"But we knew nothing about his\" does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life... The best thing about my new job is its remoteness - 60-mile round trips for house calls through the beautiful Yorkshire countryside. A whole hour per patient to admire the scenery and relax, think and pray, brood or just-be-alone! Last week I decided to use the drive to plan this... I was much affected by Bernie Palmer's meditation entitled 'Forsaken your first love?' [2]. I was particularly struck by his speaking of our need for regular spiritual appraisal. But whoever heard of appraisal without an appraiser? So, who is to be our spiritual appraiser? Ultimately, of course, the Holy Spirit...

The two most noteworthy changes are that the definition of mental disorder has significantly broadened to 'any disorder or disability of mind' and that community treatment orders\" have been introduced. Parliament's 'guiding principles'... Earlier this year supernatural phenomena were being reported in Lakeland, Florida at 'revival' events organised by Fresh Fire Ministries, and led by Todd Bentley. [1] Respected evangelical R T Kendall, now retired in Florida, was concerned but did not want to ignore a true work of God: [2] ... This autumn, debate about patients paying to 'top-up' NHS care has dominated the media. In West Sussex, Carole Simmons' family paid privately for the drug Avastin, not available on the NHS. They believed it would prolong her life. However, their NHS treatment was withdrawn as a consequence, leaving them with... The 1967 Abortion Act caused 6.8 million abortions. The 1990 Human Fertilisation And Embroyology Bill [1] takes us several steps further by bringing in more liberal embryo research, saviour siblings, animal-human hybrids, fatherless IVF children, and by making legal without explicit consent the use of tissue from children, "}
