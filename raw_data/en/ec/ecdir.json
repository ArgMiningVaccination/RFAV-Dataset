By following an anti-inflammatory diet you can fight off inflammation for good. What does an anti-inflammatory diet do? Your immune system becomes activated when your body recognizes anything that is foreign\u2014such as an invading microbe, plant pollen, or chemical. This often triggers a process called inflammation. Intermittent bouts of inflammation directed at truly threatening invaders protect your health. However, sometimes [inflammation](/topics/inflammation) persists, day in and day out, even when you are not threatened by a foreign invader. That's when inflammation can become your enemy. Many major diseases that plague us\u2014including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's\u2014have been linked to [chronic inflammation](/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-chronic-inflammation). One of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the grocery store. \"Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects,\" says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Choose the right [anti-inflammatory foods](/nutrition/eat-these-fruits-for-their-anti-inflammatory-benefits), and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you could accelerate the inflammatory disease process. | | Foods that cause inflammation Try to avoid or limit these foods as much as possible: The health risks of inflammatory foods Not surprisingly, the same foods on an inflammation diet are generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats. \"Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation,\" Dr. Hu says. \"It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases.\" Unhealthy foods also contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. \"Some of the food components or ingredients may have independent effects on inflammation over and above increased caloric intake,\" Dr. Hu says. | | Anti-inflammatory foods An Benefits of anti-inflammatory foods On the flip side are beverages and foods that reduce inflammation, and with it, chronic disease, says Dr. Hu. He notes in particular fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, apples, and leafy greens that are high in natural antioxidants and polyphenols\u2014protective compounds found in plants. Studies have also associated nuts with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [Coffee](/staying-healthy/another-benefit-of-drinking-green-tea-or-coffee), which contains polyphenols and other anti-inflammatory compounds, may protect against inflammation, as well. Anti-inflammatory diet To reduce levels of inflammation, aim for an overall healthy diet. If you're looking for an eating plan that closely follows the tenets of anti-inflammatory eating, consider the [Mediterranean diet](/staying-healthy/mediterranean-diet-linked-to-lower-inflammation-healthy-aging), which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health. \"A healthy diet is beneficial not only for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, but also for improving mood and overall quality of life,\" Dr. Hu says.
