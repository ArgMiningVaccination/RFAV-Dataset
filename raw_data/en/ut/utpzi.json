What Novicrit is used for Novicrit is used: - to treat anaemia associated with kidney disease - to treat anaemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer - in patients with anaemia who are about to undergo surgery as an alternative to a blood transfusion where there is the likelihood of moderate blood loss - in patients with anaemia who face major elective surgery and who, prior to it, donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during and after surgery. Novicrit stimulates the production of red blood cells and hence, a higher volume of blood can be taken from these patients. Novicrit contains the active ingredient epoetin lambda (rch). Epoetin lambda (rch) is man-made and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone produced in your kidneys. Epoetin lambda is a hormone which works by stimulating the production of red blood cells. It is used to treat anaemia, a condition in which there is a decreased number of red blood cells. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason. Novicrit is available only with a doctor's prescription and is not addictive.

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin. Do not use this medicine if: - you have or have had high blood pressure which is not properly controlled - you have a medical condition where the production of red blood cells is reduced or stopped (Pure Red Cell Aplasia) which developed following treatment with any erythropoietin - you are due to have surgery and for any reason cannot receive medication to reduce the risk of abnormal blood clotting - you are due to have elective surgery and you do not donate your own blood before surgery and you have severe disorders of the veins and arteries.

Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes. Your doctor will want to know if you are prone to allergies. If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using Novicrit. Taking other medicines Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines and Novicrit may interfere with each other. These include: - iron supplements - cyclosporin, an immunosuppresant. Such medicines may be affected by Novicrit or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine. How to use Novicrit Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. Your doctor will conduct investigations, for example blood tests, to help decide whether it is necessary for you to have Novicrit. They will work out the correct dose of Novicrit for you to use, how long the treatment should continue and how it will be given. This decision will be influenced by the cause of your anaemia. The dose you receive is based on your body weight in kilograms. Novicrit is administered either into a vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneously). Your doctor will know which route of administration is preferable in your case. How much to use - In patients with kidney failure Novicrit will usually be administered by the intravenous route but may also be given by the subcutaneous route. The recommended initial dose is 50IU/kg bodyweight 3 times a week. The starting dose may be adjusted by your doctor as needed to properly control your condition. - The initial dose for cancer patients is 150IU/kg bodyweight given subcutaneously 3 times a week. The starting dose may be adjusted by your doctor depending on how your anaemia responds to treatment. - In patients who are scheduled for elective surgery, the subcutaneous route is used. The usual dose is 600IU/kg bodyweight for 3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery. Alternatively, 300 IU/kg may be administered for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for 4 days immediately after. - In patients who donate blood prior to major surgery the recommended dose is 300IU to 600IU/kg bodyweight twice a week for 3 weeks. The intravenous route is used. Iron is an important constituent of red blood cells. It is important that levels of iron in your blood are normal throughout Epoetin lambda treatment. Where appropriate you will receive iron tablets or injections to ensure that the iron in your body will not be used up as more red blood cells are produced. How to inject Novicrit yourself At the start of your therapy, Novicrit may be injected by medical staff. However, your doctor may decide that it is right for you to learn how to inject it under the skin yourself. You will receive appropriate training for you to do this. Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself before you have been trained to do so. The Novicrit pre-filled syringe is ready for use. Only use solutions which are clear, colourless and free of visible particles. Do not shake the syringes. Ask your doctor if you are unsure of the correct dose for you. They will tell you exactly how much to use. Follow the instructions they give you. If you inject the wrong dose, Epoetin lambda may not work as well and your problem may not improve.
