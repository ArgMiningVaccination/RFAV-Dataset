Call 911 for all emergency situations. Childbirth is not a day, nor a moment, but a nine month journey to motherhood. And at Providence Mission Hospital we're here to offer an experience that is truly different, to walk that path together with you; with respect and empowerment, knowledge and understanding. Because we believe you are what's naturally best for your baby. And for one of life's most precious events, one you'll remember for the rest of your life, at Mission Hospital we offer a whole new approach to modern obstetrics. From exceptional labor and delivery services to an in-hospital midwifery birth center, Providence Mission Hospital offers safe, flexible birthing options that focus on your needs and respect your preferences. Whether you partner with one of our highly regarded obstetricians, or a certified nurse midwife, we'll walk with you through your pregnancy, listen closely, offer sound options and help you make informed decisions. Then we'll follow your lead \u2014 because you're the mom. Leaning toward a natural birth, with no interventions, in our cozy birth center? Great! Prefer an epidural ASAP? Also great! We're here to support your choices, your comfort and your safety. A Perinatal Nurse Navigator is available to help all patients, whether midwife or OB attended, in preparation for your delivery (including pre-admission). Our state-of-the-art facility has specialized physicians and services immediately available for any need that arises. And for maximum peace of mind, Providence Mission is the only hospital directly connected to CHOC at Mission Hospital, with expert neonatologists on-site 24/7 for babies who need specialized care. The maternal fetal medicine specialists at Providence Mission's Perinatal Diagnostic and Treatment Center work closely with CHOC's team to ensure the best care possible for mothers and babies. Even high-risk moms can feel secure because expert perinatologists are available to OBs and midwives during pregnancy and delivery. With Providence Mission's team by your side, you've got this. Let's Plan Together When you choose an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) to be your partner through pregnancy and delivery, we'll help you create a birth plan that fits your preferences. If you prefer natural birth but still want to partner with an OB-GYN, many of our doctors support natural, unmedicated birth plans - you can even request a doula, and enjoy soothing amenities like hydrotherapy and LED candles in our state-of-the-art labor and delivery unit. We respect and honor your plan-understanding that preferences and safety concerns can change throughout your pregnancy and right up to delivery day. A Modern Labor and Delivery Approach When you go into labor, you can expect the same level of supportive, compassionate, and safe care you've received throughout your pregnancy. We'll respect your birth plan, and you'll be able to choose when and if pain medication will be used. Your labor and delivery experience will be based on your preferences and what is safest for you and your baby at the time of delivery. Most babies can be born with very little medical help, and that's good news because when we minimize surgical intervention, we help ensure a safer delivery. We'll monitor your health and the health of your baby during the labor and birthing process. Unless necessary, we'll work with you to avoid common interventions like inducing labor or episiotomy to help prevent dangerous complications that can delay healing. Lower Risk. Higher Confidencey At the same time, we know every birth is different, as is every new mom. If you choose an epidural for pain relief-even if you change your mind from your birth plan-we will honor your request when it's safe to do. You are in charge of your birth experience, and that means easing your discomfort. Did you know that women are three times more likely to experience complications during cesarean delivery? For your safety, our OB-GYNs encourage vaginal birth even if you've had a previous C-section, when possible. However, there are times when a cesarean delivery may be medically necessary, and our experts will help ensure both you and your baby are safe and comfortable. Let's Start this Journey Together If you're ready for an outstanding pregnancy experience, start by choosing an OB-GYN who will be a good fit for you and will prioritize your safety. It's so important to find someone who listens to you, doesn't pressure you, and gets you-both your head and your heart. It's your pregnancy. Let Providence be your partner. If you want to bring your baby into the world naturally, Mission Hospital offers the best of both worlds. Our in-hospital midwifery birth center - one of only two in Southern California - offers natural childbirth in a home-like setting within the safety of a specialty hospital. We'll honor your decision to have an unmedicated birth, but if you change your mind or certain circumstances arise, we can provide pain management and other services. For women with low-risk pregnancies, this means you can have the natural, home-like experience that you want, with the benefit of immediate access to modern safety measures if they become necessary. In your private suite at the Mission Hospital Birth Center, your midwife - and a doula, if you like - will support you through this very natural process. If any issues arise, rest assured that Mission's OBs, nurses, laborists, anesthesiologists, perinatologists and Level 3 Neonatal ICU services are on hand 24/7 for full medical support. And for babies who need specialized attention, CHOC Children's at Mission is right inside our hospital. Mission Hospital is proud to collaborate with the midwives of Mission Heritage OB/GYN to offer comprehensive care for women, from preconception and family planning to prenatal care, delivery, postpartum care and well-woman care. These highly trained certified nurse midwives (CNMs) are licensed through the Board of Registered Nursing and certified through the American Midwifery Certification Board. Most also hold master's degrees in nurse midwifery and women's health. The word midwife means \"with woman.\" Your midwife will be with you throughout your pregnancy, delivery and early parenthood to provide trusted guidance, encouragement and support. Some of the ways we help, specifically, include: - Assisting you to develop a birth plan that reflects your personal wishes - Discussing both holistic and medical approaches to the discomforts of pregnancy - Helping you prepare emotionally, mentally and physically for pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum changes - Referring you to childbirth and breastfeeding education resources Our goal is for you to feel confident, prepared, well-supported and cared for during this intimate experience. It's our privilege to walk it with you. The midwifery suites in our birth center are comfortable, homelike spaces designed exclusively for natural childbirth. Our spacious, family-friendly rooms include: - Queen-size beds - Hydrotherapy showers and tubs - Birth stools and birth balls - Soothing amenities such as music, aromatherapy, LED candles and massage - Nitrous oxide as a pain-management option - Support from nurses who specialize in working with midwifery patients and doulas Our four midwifery suites are set apart from our traditional labor and delivery area to maintain a natural, homelike environment. While medical interventions such as epidurals and Pitocin (a labor inducer) are not used in the midwifery suites, a transfer to labor and delivery can happen in moments if new needs arise. Your midwife will stay by your side and continue to support you. Whether you choose a midwifery suite in our birth center or traditional labor and delivery, you have the full support of Mission Hospital behind you, including: - Comprehensive care, from preconception and family planning to prenatal and postpartum care, well-woman care, and treatment for minor gynecological issues - Extended appointment times - Shared decision-making between you and your providers - Clear education and communication - Referrals to in-house specialists and community resources - Collaborative, supportive back-up physicians on call and available when needed - Laborists and anesthesiologists on site 24/7 - Co-management with highly skilled obstetricians for higher-risk patients - Support for vaginal births after caesareans (VBAC) - A Perinatal Nurse Navigator is available to help all patients, whether midwife or OB attended, in preparation for your delivery at Mission Hospital (including preadmission) If you are expecting a low-risk birth, the decision is entirely up to you. Doctors and nurse midwives have the same goals - a healthy mom and baby - but their approach is different. The Midwifery model of care is more holistic. We view the mother/baby as inseparable, and thus, individualize care with the guidance of evidence-based information. We view labor as normal and honor this, but also appropriately intervene, consult, collaborate and refer as needed to our OB experts and other health care professionals. Mission Hospital offers safe options and we're here to support your choices. We look forward to helping you welcome your little one to the world.
