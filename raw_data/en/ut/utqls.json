Presentation warns about evils of Satanism Chad Graham The Daily Iowan Satan, disguised in video form, visited the Union Tuesday night in a presentation given by Iowa City and Minneapolis, Minn., pastors. The video, intended to inform pe0- ple about Satanism, was sponsored by the Solid Rock Christian Church in Coralville because \"people seem to be interested in it and it needs to be exposed,' pastor Brad Sherman said. \"People dabble in (Satanism) and they don't realize how dangerous it is,' he said. \"At our church we talk more about God's kingdom than Satan's kingdom.\" Bruce Harpel, a pastor at the Uni\u00ad versity of Minnesota who has been studying Satsnism for 15 years, said he fmds public authorities are in the dark concerning Satanism . '\"!'he police have to take a specula\u00ad tive type of approach, they don't know what's going on,\" he said. \"They say if someone is becoming involved in Satan ism they dress darkly and listen to heavy metal music, but I have found the opposite. Many seem like ordinary people.\" The 50-minute mm discussed the ritual of Satanic cults and described the degrees of Satanism from dab\u00ad blers -who are teenagers -to gen\u00ad have had Satanism passed down through gen\u00ad erations of their families. VI graduate student John Zabel said he found out ahout the presen\u00ad tation after a trip to the bathroom. \"I came because I found the adver\u00ad tisement on a urinal,\" he said. \"It seemed interesting . It wasn't as inflammatory as I thought it would be. You can't say one way is better than the other.\u00b7 The video also described WicC80s, who are seen as white witches who believe in magic but aren't evil. Iowa City resident and Wiccan Jay Lin\u00ad nell said unlike Satanists, Wiccans worship nature and don't believe in ritual killings. \"The film had some good points,\" he said. \"The mass murderers are sick people. The mm drew a lot of parallels between the worship of Satan for magic.\" Ul graduate student and Wiccan Dawn Atkins said Wiccans are not part of a cult and are wrongly con\u00b7 fused with Satanism. MI was raised Christian, but it didn't work out for me,\" she said. \"I don't want to kill people. We don't believe in Satanism and I have no clue about Satanists. The presenta\u00ad tion was a smear campaign against cults: Though Wiccans don't have an official register, there are an esti\u00ad mated 500 Wiccans in the Iowa City area and they are a campus group, Atkins said.

The price of a new facility will not be decided until the proposal is approved, but in a report last year, the corrections department esti\u00ad mated a cost of approximately $10 million. \"It's something we've been work\u00ad ing on with the Department of Cor\u00ad rections for a number of months,\" Dean Borg, director of public affairs for UIHC, said. The Department of Corrections' report said a health facility would be an effective way of treating sick inmates, while helping to reduce the staffing needs of state prison health departments. For safety reasons, the corrections depart\u00ad ment would provide UIHC with additional security personnel. Iowa state Rep. Teresa Garman, R-Ames, said the idea of a facility at UIHC was proposed last year, but a UI representative told Gar\u00ad man the university was not inter\u00ad ested then. \"We understand there's some empty space at the hospital, so rather than build a new facility, we could utilize the empty space in a Candidates lambaste orbes on farm policy DES MOINES -Phil Gramm and Lamar Alexander ganged up on a common foe Tuesday, denouncing publisher Steve Forbes' agricultural policies and suggesting voters are tiring of his finely honed television ad image. \"People are starting to see the store-bought image of Steve Forbes -Reagan Republican -as being phony when they start looking at the real image of (a) Rockefeller Republican,\" said Texas Sen_ Gramm. Alexander, a former Tennessee governor, asserted, \"I think Iowans are wise enough not to let Forbes turn the caucus into an auction.\" Forbes, who has spent some $15 million on campaign ads, has surged ahead of the rest of the Republican presidential field in polls in advance of next Monday's Iowa caucuses, closing the gap with front-runner Bob Dole. Forbes dismissed his rivals' com\u00ad plaints, saying he's simply spending his money better than his critics do. \"The people of Iowa are not for sale. The people of America are not for sale,\" Forbes said after a cam\u00ad paign stop in Fort Dodge, Iowa. \"All I'm doing is giving out my message. \"They will judge both the mes\u00ad sage and the messenger.\" Both Gramm and Alexander, in back-to-back appearances before a convention of Iowa corn and soy\u00ad bean growers, slammed Forbes for advocating the phasing out of a tax break for ethanol. The corn-based alcohol is mixed with gasoline to make a fuel that's supposed to be less harmful to the environment. \"I fully support the federal sup\u00ad port for ethanol,\" Alexander said. \"I think to knock it out as Forbes would do would be flat wrong for Iowa.\" Gramm voiced similar views, say\u00ad ing, \"I want to encourage the devel\u00ad opment and marketing of these rur\u00ad al fuels. I don't have any problem defending the tax deferential for ethanol. I think it's in the nation's interest.\" Dole, who was in Washington , had three Republican Midwestern congressmen traveling Iowa on his behalf and talking about farm issues, including ethanol subsidies . Rep. Jim Ross Lightfoot, R-Iowa, said ethanol production accounts for about 12,000 jobs in Iowa. \"It's a proven product, and we've got a lot of evidence to show it does help clean the air. It does do a lot for the environment. Apparently . Forbes hasn't quite figured that out yet,\" Lightfoot said. Forbes has suggested that the ethanol tax break, popular among corn growers in this state, should be phased out over a seven-to Randall's Express Supermarket Coralville Hwy, 6 Iowa City Sycamore Mall 338-7966 \"We already provide substantial care to prison inmates. It's the fastest growing segment of our care to patients who are provided care at university hospitals by state mandate. \" Dean Borg, director of public affairs for UIHC state building ,D she said. Ann Rhodes, vice president for University Relations , said the uni\u00ad versity is not completely opposed to creating the facility, but UIHC has different goals than the corrections department. Those goals will play an important part in the final deci\u00ad sion, she said. \"It wouldn't really further our teaching, research or service meth\u00ad ods,\" Rhodes said. \"It wouldn't be consistent with what the hospital is there for.\" Another problem the university faces with the proposal is the sug\u00ad gested consolidation of patients into one facility, as opposed to Associated Press Presidential hopeful, Lamar Alexander, serves breakfast to support\u00ad ers Tuesday in Des Moines as Iowa Republican Chairperson Brian Kennedy, left, assists. eight-year period. His proposed flat tax calls for the repeal of virtually all tax breaks, including those for home mortgages and charitable contributions . He said in a radio talk show in Sioux City, on Monday, that farmers would get an offsetting boost for the lost tax exemption by increased exports. Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee decided to trim $1.8 million in tax breaks to the ethanol industry. But Republicans, including Dole and House Speaker New Gingrich, R-Ga., saved the tax break in what many observers saw as a political move in an election year. Dole has accused congressional Democrat s of delaying action on a farm bill to embarrass him in the Iowa caucuses. At the growers conference and in an apparent criticism of Dole, Gramm said that he didn't want to \"cut a political deal to end up with a farm bill that won't work. 1 don't want a bad farm bill.\" Gramm also accused Forbes of benefiting financially by claiming agricultural zoning for much of his estate in New Jersey. \"Steve Forbes has an estate of 520 acres, 439 of which are zoned agriculture land, on which he pays $2,100 a year in taxes and he grows polo ponies,\" Gramm said. By con\u00ad trast, an Iowa corn farmer would pay about $8,000 in taxes on such acreage, according -{. IJ~r.]~ ~' CHIQUITA BANANAS U.S.D.A.

UIHC current\u00ad ly handles approximately 350 out\u00ad patient visits per month from inmates around Iowa. \"We already provide substantial care to prison inmates,\" he said. \"It's the fastest growing segment of our care to patients who are pro-vided care at university hospitals by state mandate.D John Tyrell, a member of the Iowa state Board of Regents, said regents have not yet discussed the issue and will not form any opin\u00ad ions until the details of the facility are decided on. \"We haven't heard about it om\u00ad ciany,\" he said. \"I think the Legis\u00ad lature will have to act upon it first.\" The Oakdale prison facility was also considered as a possible inftr\u00ad mary site, but was eliminated due to its current size restraints - 1,100 prisoners are held in an area designed for 520.

If the store isn't sure whether the book has been reordered, buyback prices are lower. The resolution was adopted as a formal statement of support on behalf of the illSG to work with the ill Faculty Senate and the ill Staff Council to adopt a buyback program that is more student-friendly. \"One of our biggest concerns is the whole book fiasco,\" Johnson said. \"If \"The bottom line is that professors aren't ordering their books on time.\" UISG President Jeremy Johnson something can be done, it should be done.\" The mSG Academic Affairs Com\u00ad mittee plans to address the issues to the Faculty Senate \u00b7and help educate professors about proper notification concerning textbook orders, Johnson said. In other business, the U1SG approved the appointment of a VISG technical officer to establish a page on the World Wide Web. The person will also act as a liaison between the illSG and Weeg Policy and Informa\u00ad tion Services. The web page will include biogra\u00ad phies of the executives and student senators as well as a calendar of upcoming events, Senator Matt Stue\u00ad land said. \"We're hoping to have this going in about a month and a half,\" Stueland said.

McCurry said. He said the venue will be determined after Clinton's lawyers consult Susan McDougal 's lawyers under the auspices of the court order. David Kendall, Clin\u00ad ton's personal lawyer, said the president would cooperate \"in an appropriate fashion.\" In the order approving the Clinton subpoena, U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. directed the lawyers to proceed in a way that does not interfere with 'the president's official duties, perhaps by using videotape or even satellite.

Jim Guy Tucker, who had other business dealings with the McDouga ls, face Inner--city deterioration feeds off poor nutrition Christopher McDougall Associated Press PHILADELPHIA -Dark and dirty except for the spray paint, this hardscrabble corner of West Philly was ditched by all but two diehard grocers. Both were hard\u00ad working and well\u00b7 liked, and both were gunned down over their counters late last year. I The murders of Milton Wilks and Won Joo Choi represent more I than personal tragedies. With their deaths, neighbors must trav- el at least a mile to buy anything outside the Ding-Dong, Frito and Hawaiian Punch family. In yet another part of Philadel\u00ad phia, residents must struggle to find food for their table. And the consequences are grave. Health experts say inner\u00b7city neighborhoods are suffering a serious nutrition crisis. And the lack. of healthy foods, they say, is I. aggravating many other social ills -crime rates, health costs, poor school performances and morbid obesity. I ~ Philadelphia is not alone. Researchers for the National Can- \"People in hard-hit neighborhoods are clearly not eating enough fruit and vegetables. 1/ Tom Baranowski of the University of Texas cer Institute have made nutrition profiles of Atlanta, St. Paul, Minn., and Birmingham, Ala., and the findings there are equally bleak. \"People in hard-hit neighbor\u00ad hoods are clearly not eating enough fruit and vegetables,\" said Thm Baranowski of the University of Texas, who led the NCI study. \"And study after study has shown that such foods are irreplaceable as protective factors against can\u00ad cer and heart disease.\u00b7 Baranowski's team found last year that lower-income families eat more processed foods than their middle-and upper-income families -meaning that while the poor pay more to eat, they get less back in nutritional content. Other problems can be far more insidious and less visible, such as lead poisoning . Even mild lead buildup in a child's bloodstream will increase irritability and aggressiveness - symptoms that make for poor school performance, said Dr. Ray Yip of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. However, there's an easy, low\u00ad cost solution to lead poisoning : a diet high in iron. \"The same recep\u00ad tor in the body which absorbs lead also absorbs iron. If that receptor is already saturated with iron, it blocks out the lead,\" said Yip. But the best sources of iron are precisely those that are hardest to find in food-stamp zones -raw spinach, kale and escarole. Inner-city youngsters , therefore , run up against a double whammy. They run the greatest risk of lead consumption, from old paint in the pged buildings where they Jive, and have the highest rate of iron deficiency . Up to 5 percent of urban children younger than 2 years old are iron poor, Yip said. The same children are also prone to morbid obesity, a health\u00ad and esteem-depleting condition that nutritionists are calling the epidemic of the 90s. \"Obesity increases as you go down the economic scale,\" said Dr. Francis Johnston , a University of Pennsylvania cultural biologist . While black Americans tend to be more obese than whites, the unifying factor appears to be income, Johnston said. He was shocked to find a 23 per\u00ad cent obesity rate among young\u00ad sters at a West Philadelphia school, the highest rate he had seen among any Americans except Samoans in Salt Lake City. Besides suffering from high blood pressure and heart disease, heavy people are statistically more prone to be underachievers and are more vulnerable to depression and generally weak health, Johnston said. \"Forget about the five-a-day helping of fruit and vegetables the National Institutes of Health rec\u00ad ommends,\" said Johnston. \"These kids are lucky to get one, and it's usually orange juice.' An examination of Ida Mills' shopping basket bears that out. In her North Philadelphia neighborhood, women chat on trial March 4 on conspiracy and fraud charges. Whitewater prosecu\u00ad tor Kenneth Starr says the three got $3 million in loans from federal\u00ad ly backed lenders to benefit them\u00ad sel ves illegally. Susan McDougal is accused of receiving a $300,000 loan that David Hale, a former municipal judge who ran a small business investment firm, contends Clinton pressured him to make. Clinton's testimony would afford him an opportunity to confront under oath Hale's claim -the sin\u00ad gle most serious allegation made against the president. Clinton, who has not been charged, has called the allegation \"a bunch of bull\" and said he doesn't ever recall talking to Hale about money. \"The government case is built on the accusations of Hale,\" James McDougal said. \"We'll let the jury listen to Hale's testimony and let them listen to Clinton's testimony and let them decide who to believe.\" If Clinton appears in person, he would be subject to cross-examina\u00ad tion by Starr, who was appointed to investigate Clinton's land deal and campaign finances . Prosecutors would be allowed to introduce evi\u00ad dence or testimony to challenge the president's veracity. Just last month, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first presiden\u00ad tial spouse to be subpoenaed to tes\u00ad tify before a federal grand jury. The first lady appeared Jan. 26 before the Whitewater grand jury in Washington to answer questions about billing documents from her former Little Rock law firm that showed up in the White House two years after Whitewater prosecutors first subpoenaed them. The records from Rose Law Firm showed how much the first lady worked on land transactions on behalf of Madison Guaranty Sav\u00ad ings & Loan, which failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $65 million. Susan McDougal's ex-husband, James, ran the savings and loan. , Associated Press A man walks past the West Philadelphia grocery store where owner Won Joo Choi was gunned down. Its grated door is covered with sympathy wishes from neighbors. Choi's death by a 13-year-old with a .45-caliber pistol closed the last shop where his neighbors could buy real groceries. stoops, holding infants and watch\u00ad ing girls skip and bounce over whirling ropes. But the streets empty at 5:30 p.m. when the sun goes down and working mothers are trying to get dinner on the table. \"If it's not in my pantry, I'm not the fool to go out there and get it,\" said Mills, who Jives 10 blocks from the closest convenience store and three miles from a supermar\u00ad ket. Mills, who receives food stamps to supplement her salary, usually relies on nonperishable goods for her three children. Her shopping basket one day recently was half\u00ad filled with baked beans, creamed corn, dry spaghetti and her \"day\u00ad and-night special,\" pancake bat\u00ad ter. The single fruit was lemons. \"Anyone who sees a single woman on the street at night, heading toward a market, knows she must have some money on her,\" said Mills. \"I'm no sitting duck.\" A grocery store in Mills' neigh\u00ad borhood would have a captive market, but the crime risk makes it a \"loco\" business proposition, said Santo Del Valle, who has experienced trouble enough run\u00ad ning his corner convenience store, the American and Tropical Food Mart. Del Valle, 66, has been robbed seven times, the last leaving him unconscious and bleeding from a gun butt to the head. He's sticking it out, he said in Spanish, because \"it's an honest income, and the good people around here need me.\" But because poor customers are unpredictable shoppers, he stocks nothing fresh except bananas, which he can sell either fresh or aged for frying.

The 6-inch-thick indictment , filed in January and made public Monday, claims dozens of inci\u00ad dents of sexual penetration.

Simpson continued to fight for acquittal in the court of public opinion fuesday and defended his right to make money from the murder case despite those who \"want me to ... lay down with the homeless .\" In his third extensive interview in 24 hours, Simpson called radio station KKBT-FM to plug his made-for-profit video and try to persuade skeptics that he did not stalk or murder ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman . On Monday, he spent an hour talking by phone to CNN and later in the day did an interview with the Los Aligeles Times. Brown Simpson was \"the love of my life,\" Simpson said as he dedi\u00ad cated a song to her -\"One Sweet Day\" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men -and ridiculed claims that he stalked her. It would be just as ludicrous , he said, to think that she stalked him when she followed him to Mexico in 1993 in an effort to save their rela\u00ad tionship, which had ended the pre\u00ad vious year in divorce. Paula Barbieri, Simpson's former girlfriend , feared Simpson was sui\u00ad cidal in the days after the two mur\u00ad ders, and she rationed his prescrip\u00ad tion medicine to prevent an over\u00ad dose and searched the house he was staying in for razor blades, according to a transcript of Barbi\u00ad eri's deposition testimony . Barbieri said that at one point, Simpson 's sister had to talk him out of suicide, and Simpson said several times he wanted to shoot himself, Barbieri testified. Barbieri also believed that Simp\u00ad son received the \"Dear John\" phone message she left the day of the two murders, but she testified that he didn't sound upset over their breakup.

The prosecutor said he expects further charges against her. Both were held on $100,000 bond. Family members told WLS-TV that the charges are untrue. Hen\u00ad ry Lawrence, Barbara Hill's brother, said the children were well-cared for and had not been sexually or physically abused. Four times since May 1993, the state's Department of Children and Family Services received calls alleging child neglect at the home. But it was only last spring that allegations of abuse arose, when the children began acting strangely after they were placed in the care of a relative because they had been left home alone, DCFS spokeswoman Martha Allen said. One child rubbed feces on a wall, a second child sliced her clothing in pieces and the youngest made sexual advances to an infant, according to a source familiar with the case files who spoke on the condition of anonymity . The children were evaluated at a hospital. each independently describing the abusive family, and the prosecutor's office was noti\u00ad fied. \"We had no (previous ) indica\u00ad tion ... that these children were abused in any way.

The Chicago Tribune quoted prosecutors it did not identify as saying the children were fed \"as a regular diet\" skinned and boiled rats rolled in flour and deep-fried, and boiled cockroaches served with hot sauce. Cavins declined to comment on those reports, but two sources in the Cook County state's attorney's office, speaking anonymously, said the accounts were accurate.

Pope John Paul II arrives at the Villa Maria fields in the Black Christ, a 400-year-old wooden icon, to Esquipulas , Guatemala. The pope made a pilgrim-remind Central America of its Roman Catholic tra\u00ad age Tuesday to Esquipulas to visit the Basilica of ditions where protestant inHuence is increasing. Pope graces Guatemala Anita Snow I. Associated Press ESQUIPULAS, Guatemala - Pope John Paul II visited the birth\u00ad place of Central America's peace process Tuesday and said he hoped an end to Guatemala's civil war could be reached quickly. Pilgrims walked days from neighboring Honduras and EI Sal\u00ad vador, many of them Indians in wool capes and straw hats, to arrive here at what is also the , home of a revered 400-year-o ld cedar wood icon called the Black Christ. . Speaking in this mountain ham\u00ad let, the pope suggested to more than 30,000 faithful at an open-air Mass that a peace initiative begun here a decade ago is unfinished. \"I dearly hope that Guatema la can conclude a definitive peace accord in the very near future,\" said Pope John Paul II. Although mildly phrased, the pontiff's state-r' ment could exert substantial pres\u00ad sure on the warring sides in this strongly Catholic country. Wearing a scarlet cape and white miter, the pope recalled in his homily the Esquipulas peace accords of 1986 that helped end civil wars in Nicar,agua and El Sal\u00ad vador. He said he hoped the \"fruits of Esquipulas\" would soon be within reach of Guatemala 's 10.7 million people, including an Indian majori\u00ad ty heavily represented there in col- , orful garb. The pontiff later paid homage to the 3-foot-tall carving known as the Black Christ, made more than 400 years ago and housed in a whitewashed basilica aglow with hundreds of fluttering candles. Encased in glass, the icon annu\u00ad ally draws more than a million pil\u00ad grims and tourists. Said by the faithful to work miraculous heal\u00ad ings, the icon got its name for cen\u00ad turies' worth of blackening canQle soot and incense, recently stripped away. An ocean away, the two sides to Guatemala's 35-year conflict quiet\u00ad ly met in Oslo, Norway, in a renewed effort to nudge along negotiations that have been stalled since last year. Beginning his first visit to Cen\u00ad tral America in 13 years, the pope on Monday had exhorted Guatemalans to end the region's last and longest conflict, a war that has cost at least 120,000 lives. \"Long live Pope John Paul II,\" Indians joyously shouted amid a sea of yellow-and -white flag s in the Vatican colors while hundreds ran behind his pope mobile as it parad\u00ad ed on a grassy field called the Val- ley of Maria. . In a traditional greeting , a marimba band struck up \"The Miraculous Black Christ of Esquip\u00ad ulas\" and barefoot Indian women in flowery blouses reached out to touch John Paul's white vestments as he walked to an altar. \"How great it is that the nations of Latin America surround Christ with such veneration and love,\" said the pope. \"For four centuries this image, of Christ on the Cross, has been venerated in this place.\" But it was his message for peace that won applause. \"We were waiting for a message of peace,\" said Sergio Patillo, a 44- year-old Guatemalan schoolteacher who walked 14 hours to arrive here. \"The country has suffered much bloodshed.\" Because of foggy, cloudy weather, the pope cut his visit to Esquipulas short, returning to Guatemala City where he celebrated Mass at an outdoor field 1\\.tesday afternoon. The pope spent Tuesday in Guatemala and is in Nicaragua today. He will be in EI Salvador on Thursday and then travel to Venezuela during the 69th foreign mission of his papacy. John Paul last visited Guatemala in March 1983, when the country was ruled by the mili\u00ad tary and at the height of civil war. Guatemala's leftist rebels announced a cease-fire, the third since November , to honor his visit. \"More than mere words, the pope's visit can change the mood of the country,\" said human rights activist Frank LaRue. \"It's impor\u00ad tant to bring the peace process back into the public eye and I think he's achieving that.\" President Alvaro Arzu, elected to a four-year term on Jan. 7, has said he wants a peace accord by August. But he has yet to name a new negotiating team and tough issues remain, including demilitarization. But U.N. peace mediator Jean Arnault met with government and rebels last week and said talks look as if they would get back on track soon. iI;UU.tj,j':f.,N.:@#U,1 .. ... , i , . First lady flies Air Force to promote book Karen Gullo Associated Press WASHINGTON -Taxpayers will pick up the lion's share of Hillary Rodham Clinton's airfare for a tour to promote her best-seil\u00ad ing book about children, govern\u00ad ment and airline estimates show. Rodham Clinton is flying on a 12-seat Air Force jet that costs $2,890 per flying hour because the Secret Service wanted the first lady to use a government plane for security reasons. Rodham Clinton's aides said the taxpayer expense is an unfortunate but necessary cost, but critics said the first lady should have found a cheaper way to promote her book, which is a private endeavor. The book, \"It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us,\" is No.1 on The New York Times' best-seller list. Most of the pro\u00b7 ceeds from it will go to children's hospitals and other charities. The total bill for the plane will come to about $69,360 by the time the tour ends later this month.

Taxpayers will absorb about 80 percent of the cost. Rodham Clinton's publisher, New York-based Simon & Schuster, will reimburse the government the amount of a first-class airfare tick\u00ad et for each leg of the trip for both Rodham Clinton and the two aides accompanying her. That reimbursement would total between $11,958 to $16,164, based on fares quoted by several airlines. That would leave taxpayers to absorb between $53,196 (77 per\u00ad cent) and $57,402 (82 percent) for the flights. The Secret Service pro\u00ad tection the fll'st lady is always pro\u00ad vided would be extra. \"The security comes at some expense to the taxpayer and we regret that, but the Secret Service made a recommendation and we listened to them,\u00b7 said Neel Latti\u00ad more, deputy press secretary for Rodham Clinton. When House Speaker Newt Gin\u00ad grich, R-Ga., traveled to promote his new book last year, he agreed to pick up the cost of air travel out of his own pocket. Taxpayers paid to have plainclothes U.S. Capitol Police provide his usual security. However, there is a precedent for presidents' wives using govern\u00ad ment planes for personal book tours. Barbara Bush used a mili\u00ad tary jet, at taxpayers expense, to promote her book about the Bush's dog Millie, which became a best\u00ad seller. But in an atmosphere of cost-cut\u00ad ting and budget-balancing, critics said Rodham Clinton should have found a less expensive alternative than the $2,890-an-hour Air Force plane. David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpay\u00ad ers Union, a nonpartisan group that advocates lower taxes, said Rodham Clinton could have char\u00ad tered a jet or done live video pre\u00ad sentations to save money. Using the Air Force jet \"1s the most expensive way to tackle this,\" Keating said. The exact cost of the trip won't be known until some weeks after the final leg of the tour is complete, Lattimore said. NEW 5HIPMENTI MAX.

FoOrbes garnered 13.3 percent of the vote in December compared with 14.5 percent in February . The leveling off of Forbes' support is contrary to ~he popular belief that Forbes is the candi\u00ad date with the most momentum in Iowa, Miller said. Despite the poll's results, local supporters of Steve Forbes believe he will continue to be a favorite among Iowa voters. \"We definitely have enough support,' said Curt Mercadante, a UI junior who works on the UI Forbes presidential campaign . \"You can't tell everything from polls.

Peo\u00ad ple liked that. Now the other candidates have raised counter attacks on him and have cri\u00ad tiqued Steve Forbes.

Change in the funding policy will not affect the Class III organiza \u00ad tions' ability to continue receiving funds in these content-neutral areas. UISG President Jeremy Johnson said another system for distribut \u00ad ing funds to student organizations is in the works. \"We're trying to come up with a better plan,\" Johnson said. \"Right now we're funding organizat ions that some students might not want their money going to. \u00b7Some of these groups should be raising money themselves , like the larger student organization s. This is just free money to them, so we're still in the process of thinking it out.\" administrators, the plan was rejected. This rejection resulted in the elimination of funding for class II I organizations ' expression pro\u00ad grams, such as when the organiza\u00ad tions host special speakers , Gard\u00ad ner said. \"We submitted a plan that would have given every UI student one of three options, in terms of their Stu\u00ad dent Activities fees,\" Gardner said. \"This would affect only the money from the Student Activities fees that would go toward these expres\u00ad sion groups.\" The three options given to UI students in the rejected plan included: Students could leave the mon\u00ad ey that would be allocated to expression programs with the rest of their Student Activities fees. Although Phil Gramm's support has risen from 2.8 percent to 3.9 percent, he has dropped behind Alexander among likely caucus atten\u00ad dants. Pat Buchanan trails both men with 3.9 percent of the votes. money for expression programs to as many as three other student organizations of their choice. Gardner said with the rejection of this plan, all Class III organiza\u00ad tions will lose expre9llion program\u00ad ming funding as of July I, 1997. However, at a Friday meeting of student leaders, UI President Mary Sue Coleman and other UI administrators, it was suggested that the rejected plan might need to be re-evaluated for possible con\u00ad sideration, Gardner said. Coleman said the UI needs to make sure it is following the law, as well as being fair to the stu\u00ad dents. Gardner said it is up to students whether funding is cut. \"Now it depends on the student groups who will be affected,' he said. \"They need to write to the urSG, write editorials to The Daily Iowan, write to Mary Sue Cole\u00b7 man. \"Their fate is in their own hands.\" Continued from Page lA Samuel Becker has been acting IlS interim provost since former UI president Hun'ter Rawlings III left last July for Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.

Ann Rhodes, vice president for University Relations , said there won't be a search firm involved in filling the position, so costs will be lower than the search for Ul Presi\u00ad dent Mary Sue Coleman . Rhodes said the expenses will mostly come from advertising and travel, totaling between $30,000 and $37,000.

Only Buchanan, Gramm and anti-abortion candidate Alan Keyes campaigned here. The other GOP hopefuls stayed away from Louisiana in homage to Iowa's tra\u00ad ditional role as the first caucus state. Those boycotting included the two leading contenders, Bob Dole lind Steve Forbes, as well as former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar. They insisted in advance that Louisiana wouldn't matter. \"The presidential race begins next Monday in Iowa,\" Alexander said. Indeed, even Louiliiana Republi\u00ad cllns seemed to thin k so.

Gramm held a narrow edge among the one in sev\u00ad en who said the most important fac\u00ad tor was picking a candidate who could beat President Clinton. The exit poll was conducted by Voter News Service, a cooperative of the AP, ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC. Although he was heavily favored, Gramm found himself on the receiv\u00ad ing end of a relentless Buchanan effort to suggest the Texas senator was hardly as conservative as he would have voters believe. He attacked Gramm for voting for higher taxes, for taking money from gambling interests and for support\u00ad ing Clinton administration Supreme Court picks who support abortion rights. Buchanan got a change: said businessman Cecil Hemn, who voted in Iowa. \"We don't need any more dinosaurs like Dole or Gramm who have been in Washington forever.\" Will LaBauve, who voted in Lafayette, supported Gramm dele\u00ad gates because the Texan was \"the better candidate in that he is more likely to win.\" Retired tate worker Cecile Butcher voted for Gramm delegate s, too, but only because Forbes wasn't participating . The exit survey suggested Buchanan might find the going tougher in the more crowded con\u00ad tests to come: 20 percent of those who turned out to support Gramm, Buchanan and Keyes said they would have preferred Dole or Gramm breaks promise to vote on farm bill Tom Seery Associated Press DES MOINES -Sen. Phil Gramm missed a key Senate vote on the farm bill Tuesday as he courted Iowa farmers and then flew to Louisiana for that state's presidential contest. Gramm told a joint convention of the Iowa Soybean Association and the Iowa Corn Growers Association that he favors the \"Freedom to Farm\" bill that would overhaul fed\u00ad eral farm policy. But he was absent from the Senate Iliter in the day when an effort to revive the bill fell one vote short. Two of Gramm's rivals for the -. GOP presidential nomination, Sens. Bob Dole and Richard Lugar, were in Washington for the 59-34 vote to end Democratic delays and force a farm bill vote. The Senate needed 60 votes to bring the bill up for debate. \"Everyone knew what the vote was about and everyone knew its importance,\" Lugar said in Wash\u00ad ington. Negotiations with Democratic opponents of the bill then resumed in Washington on Tuesday evening. The bill could come up for a vote Wednesday, said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. Grassley said he was disappoint\u00ad ed that Gramm and four other Republican senators missed the vote and forced negotiations with Democrats on the bill. \"If anyone of them were here, it means we wouldn't be having to work out this,\" said Grassley , a supporter of Dole's presidential bid. When asked about Gramm's absence, Grassley said, \"Anyone interested in doing well in Iowa should have been here voting.\" At the Iowa corn and soybean convention, farmers were surprised to hear that Gramm was headed to Louisiana instead of Washington after his morning speech. \"He needs to be there,\" Wallie Hardie, a North Dakota farmer who is vice president of the Nation\u00ad al Corn Growers Association, told the Iowa convention delegates. \"\",t');\"II\"\" 'J' In Louisiana, Gramm WIIS com\u00ad peting in a presidential delegate contest that had already angered Iowans because it preceded the Feb. 12 Iowa caucuses. Dole and Lugar had agreed not to compete in Louisiana. On Tuesday morning, Gramm drew applause from the Iowa farm audience with his speech as he called for an overhaul of farm poli\u00ad cy in Washington . \"I want to move toward market setting of prices,\" Gramm told a joint meeting of members of the state soybean and corn growers associ a tions. The Texas Republican continued his presidential campaigning Tues\u00ad day while Senate leaders were in Washington trying to schedule a debate on a new farm bill. The pre\u00ad vious five-year bill expired in December , and the nation 's farmers are growing increasingly impatient while waiting for a policy from Washington that will innuence what seeds and fertilizer they buy.

Yet it is parents'responsibility, not the government's, to regu\u00ad late what children are viewing. PJult values have seeped into children's minds through the easi\u00ad ly accessible adult world. The result is a society in which values re rarely monitored and violence is increasingly becoming a norm. From television to the Internet to magazines, many children can no longer be called children. A 12-year-old and a l3-year-old dropped a 5-year-old out of a Chjca~ go housing project. Three l3-year-old boys were charged with plotting to set off a homemade bomb, the instructions for which were derived from the Internet. A 15-year-old boy was arrested for allegedly start\u00ad ing a fire that killed five members of his family. Violent ~children\" are not a new phenomenon . But children are becoming older emotionally as the technological world around them offers exposure to \"adult\" ideas. To say the problem is a \"lack of family values\" is to simplify what is happening, since every family has some sort of values. It's more apt to point to the lack of control and explanation children receive. The exposure to violent actions has changed the traditional role of the child. It's true that many traditions need to be changed, but when the result is destructiveness, the evolving pattern of violence is what needs to be examined . Increasingly, children are put into a societal category in which the boundaries become more and more fuzzy. On one hand, children are told that they cannot make their own decisions, while the blatant exposure to adult values has given them free reign to decide what they canleam. People raged at Tipper Gore when she protested the messages in violent rap music. But she had a good point. Kids cannot be expected to think in nonviolent ways if they are continuously exposed to violent themes. The increase in violence is such that the governm~nt feels a need to offer regulations. Congress recently voted to require the makers of television sets to include a feature to block out material rated as offensively violent or sexual. The new bill also bans pornography over computer networks and institutes penalties for those convicted of distributing \"indecent\" sexual material to minors. While government control is not the answer, what should be applauded is the recognition that continuous exposure to these ideas has led to a deteriorating view of the value of human life in the minds of some minors. Violence is not new; it's a part of human nature. However, the con\u00ad stant repetition of violent themes has affected the way children think. Violence is fed to kids daily through manipulated images that glare at them through the television screens, sing to them through violent rap music and beckon to them on computer screens. What children are exposed to needs to be controlled, and it needs to be restricted through parental leadership. Individual adult perception once again needs to become the model of our population. Rima Vesely is an editorial writer and UI junior. Death penalty debate To the Editor: Todd Versteegh's editorial about the death penalty (The Daily Iowan, Feb. 1) makes some grave omissions, especial\u00ad ly disturbing when one considers the enormity of the issue. He writes, \"The usual arguments against the death penalty argue ... \" - and then treats us to only the weakest and most ridiculous argument used by opponents of the death penalty. This is the infamous cost of getting through all the appeals so that society can then shoot, strangle, poison or sizzle some inhumane human. There are other consideration s. Some years ago in England, public outcry against the death penalty sur\u00ad faced. What caused this outcry? Well, it seems the state, quite unfortunately , executed an innocent man. The State -\"Sorry about the error -we will do aM in our power to restore your good name.\" Obviously, it's too late to restore that man's life and freedom. That is what I find morally superior ~th the way some states (fortunately, Iowa is one of them) handle sentencing of first-degree murder convictions . MANDATORY life sentences, NO chance for parole -period. This sys\u00ad tem also allows the opportunity to cor\u00ad rect -certainly more than execution does -any mistakes made by police, the courts, etc. \"The Thin Blue Line,\" a compelling book and documentary film, details the travails of a man sentenced to death in Texas for a crime for which he was acquitted many years laier. How many innocent people have been wrongly executed? How many \"right\u00ad fUlly\" executed people balance out the horror of a state-sanctioned murder of an innocent person? Imagine it is you strapped to that table while the state, robed in white, prepares the merciful offering. You - but only you -know you're inno\u00ad cent. What do you feel now? I'll mention two other issues. The invisible cost of rationally planned and conducted murders to a nation's psy\u00ad che. I think the issue is not that some murderous pedophile should live or die. Do we diminish and pollute our national conscience by acting as executor? Another issue is certainly prison reform. Those incarcerated should work to provide for themselves, to pro\u00ad vide restitution to their victims and per\u00ad haps to find some worth in their tasks. Paul Young UI graduate student What's the word? To the Editor: Were there two typos in Stephanie Wilbur's Daily Iowan column of Jan. 16, or did she intend to state that \"punta\" means bitch in Spanish? I am hardly an expert of Spanish -mis amigos will readily vouch for me on this -but I am a bit confused and would appreciate some clarification . Growing up in the predominantly Latino Mission district of San Francisco, I have heard the word \"puta\" and the word \"punto\": which translate, respectively and roughly, as whore and point. I have never heard \u00b7punta: Maybe there is such a word that means what Wilbur states and I missed hear\u00ad ing it in my corner of the world. Once again, please clarify the mean\u00ad ing of \u00b7punta\" for others and myself who may wish to sprinkle it, or \u00b7puta\" or even \u00b7punto\" into our conversation or writing, as Wilbur has.

Pregnant teens know whom to trust One of the best ways to deal with differing opinions is to try, earnestly , to understand con\u00ad victions with which one does not agree. The Davenport City Council passed a parental noti\u00ad fication ordinance which states that abortion providers must \"notify a parent of a minor's intent to terminate a pregnancy.\" I am trying to understand the reason for such an ordinance. Giving the ordinance a generous interpreta\u00ad tion -which means not assuming those who passed it are unsympathetic, out of touch with reality and hate women -I imagine the council members in Davenport approved this ordinance because it would help young women make informed and supported decisions. In fact, one member, Councilor Tom Carroll, says \"this ordi\u00ad nance is geared toward children that would be in the process of making a very important choice ... we feel that parents must be a part of that choice\" Carroll obviously considers pregnant young women to be \"children.\" I am not sure I agree, but [ will accept his word choice for now. Given the assumption that young pregnant women should be classified as children, Carroll basical\u00ad ly thinks parents should help their children make important decisions. Generally, I agree. I would, however , rephrase this statement by claiming that good parents should help their children make impor\u00ad tant decisions . I also believe that good parents will find that their children voluntarily come to them with their problems and ask for help. Which children would tend to resist asking their parents for help and advice? I would guess parents who do not listen well, who are not sympathetic or compassionate, and parents who abuse their children or their partners might not 1.OWACtr1 Lea Haravon be consulted when a difficult decision needs to be made. Children with good parents ostensibly already come to their parents for advice, so those pregnant teens with good parents don't need this legislation . This ordinance is for preg\u00ad nant young women who would not normally go to their parents. Parenting is not only a noun, as in \"my par\u00ad ents.\" It is also a verb, as in \"to parent.\" One does not necessarily have to conceive or bring up children to parent. The reality is that some people parent well, and others don't. Some of us got parenting from our biological or adoptive parents. Others were parented by sisters, neighbors, grandparents , clergy or friends' fathers and mothers. Children are very intu\u00ad itive and creative when it comes to getting help. They know who will really listen and help them and who will not. Pregnant young women are no different. Ordaining notification of parents (defined as biological zygote donors or primary caretakers) denies the reality that not all mothers and fathers are good at mothering and fathering and that some people without children are good at parenting . The ordinance assumes a \"Beaver Cleaver\" world, in which families are blissful safe havens. I wish that this were true for all of us, but for many of us, our families of origin were downright nuclear (as in Three Mile Island). If families really were what they are assumed to be by Mr. Carroll and others, it seems to me that we would not need this ordinance, because there is no point in creating legislation for what people do anyway. (There are no laws stating that we must breathe or sleep. If there were, surely these would be the most observed laws in the land). Since families are not universally safe and nurturing , the ordinance forces young women who know better to tell their painful truth in an unsafe situation. Perhaps these young women would rather go to their older sister, grandpar\u00ad ent, rabbi or family friend. Some have suggest\u00ad ed that the parental notification law be expand\u00ad ed to include these kinds of \"parents.\" My guess is that young women will probably talk to one of these people anyway. Again, the ordinance is not necessary. It is interesting to me that, in general, people who are anti-abortion are pro-parental consent. Do they assume that the parent will discourage abortion? I have a friend who, pregnant at 17, looked for support from her anti-abortion father (she wanted to carry the pregnancy to term). He told her to have an abortion because it would \"look bad\" in their town if she were pregnant. I appreciate Carroll's notion that \"children\" need help making decisions sometimes. I think these pregnant young women think so, too. But they know, better than he does, to whom they should turn. Lea Haravon's column appears Wednesdays on the Viewpoints Page. UM,Un, Wf\" .. \" Islam no alternative to Christianity Many African-Americans have been influ\u00ad enced by the ally cinema-conditioned -about Mrican cul\u00ad ture in the United States. Thus, Islam appears to be the only viable alternative. There is a dual Mrican-American cultural history in the United States which separates the converted from the uncoverted, Christian from traditionalist and residents of British Colonial America from those of FrenchiSpanish\u00ad held Louisiana Purchase territory. Perhaps this dual African-American cultural history explains the recent increase in populari\u00ad ty of Louis Farrakhan, and the Nation of Islam's success with young, blue-collar African\u00ad Americans. To many young African\u00b7Americans, acculturated by American popular culture, resisting Christianity, or \"the white man's reli\u00ad gion,\" in favor of Islam . However, Islam i8 \"the Arab man's religion.\" An introductory glance at the history of Islam in Africa would show how it has oppressed African culture and continues to do so. The greatest enslavers of Africans in the Middle East or with Europeans in the trans-Atlantic slave trade were Muslims. Both white and black Muslims have been the greatest oppres\u00ad sors of traditional African cultures like Egypt\u00ad ian Ra and Ira of the Yoruba. Islam's first step in Africa was the Arabian conquest of Roman-controlled Egypt. From there, Islam spread westward across the conti\u00ad nent through the famed trans-Saharan trade routes, leaving only signs of jihads, or holy wars, in its wake. Now it appears that this Islamic oppressor has followed Africans into the Americas, too. The Nation of Islam, started by Elijah Muham-Wole Mongolfe mad, popularized by Malcolm X, liberated by Wallace D. Muhammad , and today controlled by Farrakhan, is perhaps the greatest threat to African-American stability, progress and libera\u00ad tion today. Why? Because of the hypocrisy and deceit in which the Nation operates . Last year, Far\u00ad rakhan suspended a spokesperson for making anti-Semitic remarks. At that time, when asked to oppose the aide's statements, Farrakhan refused, saying he was \"not in the repudiation business.\" But that did not stop Farrakhan from repudiating, denunciating and calling for the assassination of Malcolm XI Farrakhan, who now takes credit for the Mil\u00ad lion Man March, admitted to Barbara Walters on ABC that he \"helped create a climate which led to the assassination of Malcolm X.\" Today, however, the Nation still uses Malcolm X's pop\u00ad ularity to gain support among the frustrated and poorly educated. Moreover, forces in the Nation are presently rallying against Far\u00ad rakhan for control of the Nation. These chal\u00ad lengers feel Farrakhan is \"too soft.\" (See this month's issue of Vi be magazine .) Countless media professionals questioned partiCipants about their reasons for attending the Million Man March. Overwhelmingly, par-ticipants' reasons for marching included: dis\u00ad cussing the crisis of black male unemployment, their unusually high prison population and: their racist depictions in the mainstream \u00b7 media. However, this is not the agenda of Farrakhan and the Nation. The Nation presented the march as a rally called for by Farrakhan and . responded to by his supporters. Now, for instance, the Nation's World Wide Web address is co-titled, \"Million Man March.\" Thus, it is obvious that Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam are on a mission to mislead the American people as to their motives, the motives of the African-American community, and to sell us all out to his friend, Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi, with whom he met: recently on his Mrican tour. In fact, Farrakhan also visited Nigeria and South Africa, as well. In Africa, Farrakhan presented himself as the \"leader of black America.\" This cannot go unchallenged! So, in the final analysis, around what culture will the African\u00b7Americans strive: their own ancestral ways or any number of \"foreign ways\" . introduced to them in the West? How long will European-Americans ignore the actual history of the Great Enslavement and the Islamic\u00ad African participation in favor of placating their \" own guilt, pity and finally, patronizing atti-. tudes? . Perhaps only time will tell. Or, perhaps, you: and I will. Wole Mongo Ife's column appears Wednesdays on the Viewpoints Page.

Hence the Newsweek cover of Steve Forbes tearing up a 1040 Form; no more strug\u00ad gling with form upon form, no more ~Subtract line 6 from line 5, and enter the result on Form 1040, line 24,\" each spring. But to understand the consequences of shifting to a flat tax, it is critical to understand that the tax system affects peoples' economic well-being in many ways, of which actually paying money to the gov\u00ad ernment is only the most visible. By including some things in taxable income and taxing them fully, and excluding others or taxing them more lightly, the tax system leads businesses and families to arrange their affairs to reduce their taxes. Change the system, and many aspects of the economy respond, making some people better off and others worse off'. It is important to be aware that the flat tax currently this and other changes. Of course, ber employer might choose instead to raise her pay by more than $4,500, but that would have to be recouped in higher prices for the goods it produces, making the buyers of those products worse off. One might argue, of course, that this is a good thing. People might prefer to have the extra take-home pay, so they could choose to buy less insurance and more of something else if they preferred. You could also argue that by receiving untaxed health insurance instead of taxable income, the employee is receiving a tax break unavailable to others. However you come down on these issues, it remains a fact that the results of adopt\u00ad ing a flat tax are far more complicated than simply what happens to your payment on April 15th. being proposed is intended to replace both the personal income tax that taxpayers struggle with each year and the corporate income tax. The logic, again, is that all income should be taxed once at the same rate. If busi\u00ad oesses pay income tax on what they earn, the individu\u00ad als who receive after-tax business income shouldn't be taxed on it again. Thus, under the flat tax, the corpo\u00ad rate income tax would be replaced by a tax on business income (the difference between revenue and tax\u00ad deductible costs) at the same rate that households Would a flat tax be fair? That depends on what you think is fair. In a recent paper, my colleagues Ul Pro\u00ad fessors Amy Dunbar and Tom Pogue find that when all these effects are accounted for, the implementation of a flat tax reduces the taxes of the wealthiest 10 percent of the population by $54 billion, and increases the taxes of the rest of the population by $49 billion. If you believe that this change would be fair, you have to be prepared to argue that our current tax system unfairly overtaxes the richest American s, or that other benefits from the flat tax justify it. Steve Forbes apparently thinks 80. Do you? John Solow is a UI associate professor of economics. .\"''''*-Fare hike unfair To the Editor: There they go again. The city govern\u00ad ment is proposing fare hikes and ser\u00ad vice cutbacks in bus service to offset a shortfall in transit revenues. The pro-I posed rate hikes from 50 cents to 75 cents per ride and from $18 to $25 for a monthly pass will affect a significant ~ portion of the UI student population . 'By the time you read this letter, the fare hikes probably will be well on their way to enactment. , The effect of these rate hikes will be partlcularly acute for students who live in university housing at Hawkeye Court and Hawkeye Apartments on the west side of town. Approximately six years ago, the UI. Cambus and Iowa City Transit agreed that city buses would cover this area during the day and Cambus would cover the area at night. Law school skills practical To the Editor: As a practicing attomey and relatively recent law school grad, I disagree with the editorial in the Jan. 26 Daily Iowan. This editonctf, WJ'Ittln by a third-year law student at the UI, suggested that the \"case-based\" approach to legal educa- \" lion is anachronistic and ineffectual in teaching the practical aspects of being a lawyer. The author overlooked several points: The value of leaming to think like a lawyer. Whatever their shortcomin~, well-trained lawyers halle excellent rea\u00ad soning skills. These skills include the ability to parse complex factual situa-Although a portion of their student fees already goes to Cambus, students who live at Hawkeye Court or Hawkeye Apartments have to pay regular ICT rates during the day. Under the current agreement, these students are paying for transportat ion service twice. Those expenses will rise with a fare hike. A comparison of current expendi\u00ad tures will illuminate the problem. If one assumes that a student living at Hawk\u00ad eye Apartments buys a monthly ICT pass, he or she will pay $162 over nine months (this would rise to $225 under proposed fare hikes). In addition, a small portion of the student fees will go toward Cambus each semester. A com\u00ad muter who is eligible for a UI parking pass (many students who live in univer\u00ad sity housing are not eligible because they live too close to campus) pays 538.25 for the same nine months. A student who lives in a dorm serviced by Cambus pays only a small portion of his or her student fees each semester for unlimited transportation . What a beneficial deal th is is for UI students who live in university housing on the west side of town, many of whom have families! Cambus should service university housing during the day when most stu\u00ad dents need to get to campus and back. ICT could cover it at night. ICT would lose revenue in this scenario, but the students who live in university housing should not be a revenue source in a sweetheart deal. It is time for the UI's central adminis\u00ad tration and student government to rec\u00ad tify this situation which is a detriment to a substantial portion of UI students. Anything less is a disservice to those students who live in university hOUSing. J.

Ricky Byrdsong's squad also took Penn State to overtime , buJ lost 83-74. , \"It's a much better North\u00ad western team we're going to see than what their won-lost record indicates , ~ Davis said. Despite NorthweBtern 's poor record and Iowa's need for a Big Ten road win, Davis doesn't foresee an easy path for his Hawkeyes, thanks in large part to the Wildcats' recent play. \"They'll play better basket\u00ad ball down the stretch -and yet they've played some real good teams already,\" Davis said. \"We don't have an easy one and yet you'd like to have an easy one about right now to get back on track and get some of the kids on the bench 'lbnigbt will be Iowa's fifth attempt at a Big Ten road win. Iowa junior Jess Settles said that -when it all boils down -there isn't much dif\u00ad ference between playing on the road and playing at Carv\u00ad er-Hawkeye Arena. The reason for the severity of Kingsbury's pun\u00ad ishment is because he has already served one sus\u00ad pension this seaSOIl. The Hamilton, Ohio native served a one-game suspension for an incident against Indiana March 12 of last year. It was served concurrently with a suspension received after an arrest for public intonca tion. He also received a private reprimand after the incident.

What do you think is the role of the colleliate athlete in society? JS: It's so much more today than just stepping on the floor and yet that's your main job. I think there are so many young kidB that look up to the athlete more than the parent. I try, myself, to help out a youngster anytime I can, but I also undmtarict'l1ow some athletes argue that we should just play and people will just leave us alone. I, myself, take the role that if I can help anybody out, I'll do it. DI:How do you feel about tra,h.talJdn, in collertate and profesBionai sports? \"It's basically, you JUBt see the rim and you hit the shot,\" Settles said. \"There are places that are tougher to play than others -lighting and stuff - but all great shooters and great players just adjust.\u00b7 Kingsbury's suspension comes one day after the Big Ten reprimanded Michigan State's Jon Gar\u00ad avaglia for striking Purdue's Roy Hairston during a weekend game. The warm, welcoming reception for \"Big Dawg\" -and for officials from Florida, Washington and Texas -was nothing like the often hostile, skeptical reception of TagH\u00ad abue, \"Before the NFL asks for legisla\u00ad tive relieve, I would urge it to take some good faith gestures to respond to the problem of owners blackmailing cities, which 1 believe are very much of the NFL's own making,\" Baid Rep.

We are just kids and for some reason, in the fans perspective, once you get the uni\u00ad form on you are Bupposed to be transformed into a perfect person.

DI: What il it like to be in the spotlight at a major Big Ten univenity? JS: It's a dream come true for me and it's something since I was young I humbly expected .

DI: What would people be surprised to learn about JeBB Settles? JS: The fans don't understand that when we step on the floor we are completely different than we' are off the floor. It's a focus thing. There are some times when a fan will come up and ask for an auto\u00ad graph and will be real shy and think I'm going to kill them, but if you were to come to a practice you would see that I'm going to be laughing and maybe kicking a few balls in the BtandB too.

UNBEATEN IN SIX GAMES i1 Devils surge in second half David Wilkison Associated Press EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. - Lucky breaks, a boost of confi\u00ad dence and the thought of missing the playoffs have sparked a mid\u00ad season surge by the reigning Stan\u00ad ley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. . And an extra practice before the NHL All-Star break apparently didn't \u00b7hurt, although coach J!lcques Lemaire doesn't consider it a major factor. But this much is known. Since reaching the break at 19-22-4, the Devils are unbeaten in six games (4-0-2), the most recent a 3-2 over\u00ad time victory Saturday against Ottawa. A more stringent test awaits them tonight -a visit by Mario Lemiuex's Pittsburgh. \"1 think we got on a bit of a roll, and now we're starting to believe ltgain that we can win games even ~hough we're tied going into the end of the game or even down a goal,\" said right wing Randy McK\u00ad ay. . \"I don't know ... if they're start\u00ad ing to feel the playoffs or if they realize they were not working bard enough to win, but now it ~eems like they're more involved, ~ore serious,\" Lemaire said. He down played the canceled day off and the extra \"punishment\" practice he ordered last month before the All-Star break. It fol\u00ad lowed a poor performance by New (II think we got on a bit of a roll, and now we're starting to believe again that we cart win games even though we're tied going into the end of the game or even down a goal. \" Randy McKay, New Jersey Devils right wing Jersey in a a 4-2 home loss to Boston. \"I don't think it has anything to do with that practice,\" Lemaire said. ''They had their days off and they came back and realized that the playoffs are getting closer. They want to make the playoffs.\" Captain Scott Stevens agreed that no one relishes the thought of missing the playoffs. \"That's the only goal right now,\" he said. \"We're not looking for first place or anything. We're just look\u00ad ing to get in the playoffs. \"We're getting some breaks, we're winning the games by a goal now instead of losing by a goal like we were before. We're win\u00ad ning the close, low-scoring games. You only get breaks by working hard, and we're working harder.\" Neal Broten agreed \"some lucky breaks\" had contributed to the streak, and said the team needs to stay focused on winning. \"We haven't been playing really any better,\" he said. \"1 think we better count our blessings and not be patting ourselves on the back too hard.\" Perhaps an extension of their recent good fortune is the current state of the Penguins. The Devils are meeting a slump\u00ad ing Pittsburgh team, which leads the Northeast Division despite having lost three consecutive games. But the New Jersey players understand slumps, and realize they can't count on Pittsburgh's to continue much longer. \"We've got to be focused and be ready for the Pittsburgh that we know Pittsburgh can be,\" McKay said. \"Slumps happen for different teams at different times, and you never know where they're going to break out of it.\" TOUCH THE EARTH TOUCH THE EARTH OUTDOOR RECREATION AND EDUCATION PROGRAM .

He capped it with career-bests of 420 yards and nine touchdowns in a 72-48 championship victory over Milford. If those numbers aren't convinc\u00ad ing enough, consider what a physi\u00ad cal specimen Miles is. Last spring, he bench pressed 427 pounds and did 15 reps of 310 pounds. After a summer off, Miles opened his senior year by running the 40 in 4.6 seconds in high grass and a physical showed he only had 4 percent body fat. Shely said. \"He's probably going to grow about another inch to around Doonesbury 6-3, he'll carry anywhere from 235 to 240 (pounds), and he's not going to lose a step.\" While life in Lubbock would be an adjustment, it's nothing a red\u00ad shirt year couldn't fix_ Aiding Miles in the transition could be several Red Raiders from nearby Sudan.
