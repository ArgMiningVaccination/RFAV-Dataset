Katerina Zelenkin, is a Registered massage therapist. She is in good standing and member of College of Massage Therapists and member of Registered Massage Therapists Association of Ontario. Her interest in massage therapy was sparked after receiving her first massage from a student clinic. From there she wanted to help people using massage therapy. A graduate of the Sutherland Chan School of massage therapy, she believes there is no quick fix for poor habits (for instance: posture). Massage therapy needs to be part of everyday healthy living, to prevent accumulation of stress, poor posture and re-occurrence of pain among the numerous other benefits. Katerina is passionate about her clients achieving optimal health and living it everyday. Katerina has over 10 years of experience and specializes in relaxation, sports, pregnancy, and deep tissue massage, lymphatic massage among other types of treatments. Generally after your massage treatment, Katerina may suggest some self-care in the form of stretches and strengthening exercises, or hydrotherapy / hot / cold applications based on the focus of treatment. She will also educate you on proper posture and work ergonomics if needed. The massage therapy treatments are adjusted to clients long and short-term goals and the progress is monitored. Re-assessment of treatment goals is usually done after about four treatments. At Nature's Intentions Naturopathic Clinic, we provide naturopathic services that are focused on helping our clients optimize their health and well being. "}
