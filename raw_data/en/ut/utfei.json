And this is an excellent method for nurturing bacteria.\" \u2014Rudolf Steiner Based on brief, pithy quotations from Rudolf Steiner's collected works, the \"spiritual perspectives\" in this volume present core concepts on the subject of epidemics. These brief extracts do not claim to provide exhaustive treatment of the subject, but open up approaches to the complexity of Steiner's extraordinary world of ideas. Some readers will find these fragments sufficient stimulus in themselves, while others will use the source references as signposts toward deeper study and understanding. C O N T E N T S: 1.
