Problems. Still. Find. You. - Maybe you're experiencing minor daily obstacles in health, finances, relationships, business, depression, the unseen. Sure, these are small problems but they keep piling up. - Maybe you're worried that your life is too-good-to-be-true. Is something bad just around the corner? When is your streak of good luck going to run out? - Maybe you're too busy with life. You believe in spiritual solutions but you have no time for prayers. - Or maybe you're thinking, \"All of this describes what I'm going through!\" The karma connection People often say that experiences are caused by karma. And guess what? It's true. Karma is the energy created from things that we have done in the past. It remains dormant until it's triggered. Once triggered, we will experience that energy, which can be positive, negative or neutral. We all want to experience good karma coming back from the good things we have done in the past. However, karma runs out once we use it up. So we have to keep creating good actions if we want to keep having good experiences. We have also created plenty of negative karma which comes back as problems and difficulties. For some of us, negative karma may even return as a landslide \u2014 once it starts it just doesn't end and there's no easy way to escape. Unfortunately, we have no control over what karma is triggered, when it's triggered, or what problems it causes. And sometimes in life, even if we do our best to solve a problem, it's really just beyond us. But what if there's a proven way to help you divert your bad karma before it opens + overcome the problems that you already have? It's the universal law of cause and effect. Overcome karma, one step at a time A puja is a formal set of rituals and prayers to help you overcome obstacles and create the results you're looking for. Pujas work by purifying karma and creating merits. Merits are a special type of energy that can give you a good life situation + propel you to the highest spiritual state. What's more, merits are superior to good karma because they won't run out! Pujas are traditionally performed in temples by qualified monks, nuns or lay practitioners. They are done on behalf of benefactors who contribute towards the cost of the pujas and offerings. In return, the benefactor receives specific benefits such as: - Healing + long life - Better finances - Success in personal + business endeavours - Protection from seen + unseen dangers - Fewer obstacles + challenges - Favourable situations - Purification of past negative karma - Good karma + great merits However, not everyone has the time or financial resources to do regular pujas and offerings to generate enough merits to dilute the effects of karma. This is where we can help. Spiritual Supplements for your Karma We offer three types of done-for-you subscription plans to give you your daily and weekly dose of Sacred Pujas and Offerings.
