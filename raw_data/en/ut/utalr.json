The nervous system controls the functions of every cell, tissue, organ and system of your body. When the 24 bones that protect the spinal cord lose their normal position or motion, delicate nerve tissue can become choked or irritated. If your spine is out of alignment, chiropractic can correct this condition \u2014 without drugs or surgery, or the accompanying side effects. It's fitting that a child is delivering this message, as kids see many benefits from chiropractic care. Misalignments of spinal bones can occur early in life. During many typical births, a baby's head and neck are pulled and twisted as the newborn exist the birth canal. This can move spinal bones out of alignment and may cause problems later. Growing children benefit from regular chiropractic checkups as they become more active and encounter the routine bumps and falls of childhood. Youths involved in school sports programs can also benefit from chiropractic care both to maintain spinal heath and help improve athletic performance. I can help your entire family feel better and move better at every age and stage of life. Call 425-778-9600 today for a consultation. \u2014 "}
