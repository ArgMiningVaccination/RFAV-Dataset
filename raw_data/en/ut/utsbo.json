So we invite you very warm - ly to the annual conference of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum from 14-19 September 2021! If we celebrated the 100th birthday of Anthroposophic Med - icine in 2020, this year's annual conference with the title \"Human and Planetary Health - The Responsibil - ity of Medicine for People and Nature\" will be devot - ed to the big birthdays of our therapeutic movement: anthroposophic pharmacy, eurythmy therapy and the hospital impulse celebrate their 100th birthday . How do we deepen our understanding of how substances work in the human being and of the phar - maceutical processes required to this end which \"dis - solve elements into happenings\" , producing the ac -tion of becoming out of finished substance? This is the key question of anthroposophic pharmacy . Eurythmy therapy seeks to understand the action of vowels, consonants and words and the relationship between the spirit active in the world of substance and these logos forces at work in the sounds. There are a growing number of academic studies on the thera - peutic efficacy of eurythmy therapy. One large study, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, on \"Tai Chi and eurythmy therapy in fall prevention\" in the elderly is currently being con - ducted under unusual, i.e. partially virtual, conditions (https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/entaier-study/ studienbeschreibung.html ). The therapeutic forces of Anthroposophic Medi - cine were given their own \"building\" at an early stage From left to right: Pasque flower (Pulsatilla vulgaris) a typical plant currently adorning the rockery at the Goetheanum; cover of this year's annual conference of the Medical Section on the topic \"Human and Planetary Health - The Responsibility of Medicine for People and Nature\"; impression from the IPMT (Inter - national Postgraduate Medical Training) in Thailand which took place in April 2021, partly online, partly with face-to-face events. Dear Co-workers and Friends of the Medical Section!Whitsun verse Where sensory knowledge ends, That is where the gateway is located Which opens the realities of life To soul existence; The soul creates the key When it grows strong In the battle which cosmic powers Fight on their own ground With human forces; When through itself it drives out The sleep which envelops forces of knowledge With the night of the spirit At the limits of its senses. Rudolf Steiner, V. Vienna, 6 May 1915, (GA 40)Newsletter of the Medical Section Whitsun 2021 2The pandemic meant that we had to move the ear - ly years conference to 15-18 June 2022. On 7 May 2021, a series of five online contributions started which will concern themselves into June with the topics of pregnancy and early childhood with refer - ence to the current challenges in the pandemic . The mostly dialogue-based contributions come from in - ternational speakers in Africa, the USA and Europe; they can also be called up retrospectively if people register at a later time ( https://MedSection.goethea - num.org/ en). It was possible for the IPMT (International Post - graduate Medical Training) to take place in Thailand in the week from 20-26 April 2021. The majority of the 50 participants gathered at the conference loca - tion in Bangkok, another group participated online. A powerful and beautiful final session made clear how much initiative and love was poured into this IPMT by the organisers around Dr Kan-anek Kaewthaweesab. Appropriately for the challenges of our time, the focus was on the mental development of people, on topics such as anxiety, sleep disorders and depression. Al - bert Schmidli provided a Goetheanistic view of the metals and planets, tone eurythmy could be experi - enced, external applications in palliative medicine and a workshop on eurythmy therapy communicated practical therapeutic knowledge. More and more doctors in Thailand are also active in the field of mis - tletoe therapy for patients with cancer. Apart from the activities at the Goetheanum, in - tensive anthroposophical medical work is taking place in many countries: in Spain, FECISA is being founded this summer as an umbrella association of the an - throposophical medical therapies ; in Britain, two new Medical Section coordinators have started work; similarly in Brazil . The English Training in Anthropo - sophic Medicine in Britain, as an English-language medical training, is largely being held online and has found very interesting, interactive forms ( http:// www.emerson.org.uk/anthroposophic-medicine ). Colombia is organising monthly online seminars on topical medical subjects which place themselves in the context of the IPMT training ( https://www.ad - mac.com.co/eventos/ ) and in which experts both from South America and also from Europe are in - volved, thus enabling important interchange. A phar - maceutical training is starting this year in three plac - es (Thailand, Poland/Russia and Peru). In the USA, the results of the oncological training there are being compiled in an English-language publication on an - throposophical oncology . The work of IKAM as the coordinating group of the Medical Section has been strengthened. We are very pleased that Gudrun Rehberg has joined the Coordi - nation of Anthroposophic Body Therapies ! A very warm thank you goes to her predecessor, Conrad already - the Clinical and Therapeutic Institute, now Klinik Arlesheim, founded by Ita Wegman. In direct proximity to and in spiritual connection with the Goetheanum as the house of the word, this hospital started its work in June 1921. The hospital impulse has a turbulent century behind it and in the last two dec - ades in particular has had to cope with considerable challenges. Now hospitals and anthroposophical de - partments have come about which have each devel - oped their own profiles on the basis of Anthropos - ophic Medicine, created connections with university medicine and research, training and teaching, created new forms of institutional togetherness, networked with other hospitals and outpatient settings, and deep - ened the therapeutic impulses. During the annual con - ference we want to create opportunities for encounter and reciprocal learning in order thereby to contribute to the hospital impulse starting its new century with much energy. Medicine requires not just professional skills but just as much ethical and spiritual development. After all, the question of what is \"good\" for the patient is not a scientific one but essentially a moral one. In this respect, following the specialist conferences of the an - nual conference, we will concern ourselves with the meditative path of knowledge of the therapist. This path precedes the universally human path of develop - ment of the School of Spiritual Science, the Michael School, and leads to the ethical development of the art of healing, that is the meditative path of knowledge of the therapist connected with the being of Raphael. Alongside the two parts of the specialist conferenc - es and the conference of the School of Spiritual Sci - ence, a third part of our annual conference this year is devoted to multiprofessional collaboration . An art of healing can only develop through the interaction of the world and the macrocosm. The recovery of the human being requires the healing forces of nature, of the earth. We require a system of \"medicine that takes responsibility for people and nature\" in the sense of \"human and planetary health\" . This conference topic leads us directly to the current challenges threatening the health of people and the earth. It enquires into the helping contribution which a system of medicine in - spired by anthroposophy can make. We very much look forward to seeing each other again at the Goetheanum. Many impulses for the fu - ture have grown out of the last conference on the 100th birthday of Anthroposophic Medicine: about 40 contexts in which young people are working to - gether have arisen worldwide and continue the work of the previous Young Medics Forum in a new and evolved shape. The fruits and impulses of this work all over the world will flow into the annual conference. But we will also attempt to stay in contact with all those who cannot travel to Europe this year.3Lorenz, who unfortunately had to end this work. Our good wishes go with him as well as to the newly es - tablished Coordination of Body Therapies with Elma Pressel and Gudrun Rehberg! In the Goetheanum Leadership we are working on the challenges of the present time . They require the different sections of the School of Spiritual Sci - ence to work together because only by doing so can sufficient forces and helping impulses arise. In differ - ent formats, contributions, discussion and conversa - tion forums are made available on Covid-19 and the vaccination problem, on the restrictions of basic rights, on attacks on anthroposophy, on the impor - tance of art and on ethical as well as spiritual points of view ( https://www.goetheanum.tv/leben-und-ge - sellschaft ). The battle of cosmic powers with human forces in the human soul mentioned in the Whitsun verse - which introduces this newsletter - is expressed in the events of our time and needs \"keys\" for the re - alities of life. They consist of the individual develop - ment of the human being which - and this is a cen - tral Whitsun motif - leads to community building . This is connected with a spiritual being that reaches beyond the angel of the individual human being and can become effective through it. With warm greetings near and far! Matthias Girke and Georg Soldner NOTICES National register on dealing with Covid-19: Our col - league Prof Harald Matthes and his epidemiological research group have succeeded in setting up a register study at Berlin's Charit\u00e9 hospital. The register is in - tended to help compare: people without Covid-19 vaccination, with Covid-19 vaccination, adverse reac - tions to the vaccination, people with Covid-19 infec - tion or illness, as well as the occurrence of long Covid and the question of immunity through vaccination versus natural immunity. Only a broadly-based regis - ter will make it possible to come to a subsequent as - sessment of various strategies and vaccines. The regis - ter has been examined with regard to data protection law and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charit\u00e9. It is aimed at all citizens in German-speaking countries, regardless of whether they have already contracted Covid-19, are unvaccinated or vaccinated, so anyone aged 18 or over can take part. The survey (in German) can accessed via the following link: https:// sozmed.charite.de/redcap/surveys/?s=FL3MD - D8KFR&l=2 Children and coronavirus - the \"Here you can thrive!\" campaign: In view of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for children, the \"Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood\" working group (CARE I) of the Medical and Pedagogical Sections would like to put down a marker. Because children need reliable spaces for development at this time in particular.

For kindergartens, and parents! \"Imago Proxima Centauri\" founded in Milan/Italy: Our medical colleagues Dr Laura Borghi and Dr Dan - iele Nani are co-founders of the new \"Imago Proxima Centauri\" association. The trigger was \"the worrying pandemic scenarios and an accelerating move to - wards an era increasingly dominated by abstract thinking and algorithms\" . The main purpose of the as - sociation is \"the renewal of biology, which until now has been largely dependent on the paradigm of phys - ics. Only a qualitative biology, capable of capturing the essence of life, can help medicine move beyond the domain just comprising quantity and statistics, which has increasingly replaced the category of the human being. An epistemology and phenomenology as developed by Goethe and Steiner are the basic tools for this. The association will promote training seminars, studies and research in this direction which we consider to be fundamental for the proper devel - opment of a medicine in Ulm/Ger - many: The new association comprises pharmacists and biologists and offers basic training in Goethean - ism. The first module will take place in Stuttgart from 23-26 September 2021 on the subject: \"The metamor - phosis of the plant - ways to developing living think - ing\" .

The background to it is that increasing numbers of countries are liberalising assisted suicide and active euthanasia through legal regulations. What is the po - sition of Anthroposophic Medicine in this regard and what can it set against such a development? Read the statement on Anthromedics: https://www.anthro - medics.org/PRA-0981-EN Remembrance - on the 100th birthday of the physi - cian Hans-Heinrich Engel: Hans-Heinrich Engel was born in Germany on 29 July 1921. After studying med - icine, he found his way to Anthroposophic Medicine via homoeopathy. From 1951 until his early death in 1973, he was active in the Camphill movement as a close associate of Dr Karl K\u00f6nig. He not only possessed great knowledge but also had a wealth of creative and therapeutic ideas. In addition to medicine and music therapy, his affectionate interest was devoted to the children at Camphill for whom he himself developed the most effective music for therapy. This led to the significant lectures on \"Musical Anthropology\" which Engel gave in various countries and conferences and which are published in the Persephone series of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum.
