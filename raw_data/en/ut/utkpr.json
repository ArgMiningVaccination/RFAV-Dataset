The contents of t his plan will focus your attention on responding to a pandemic. Similar to an epidemic, a pandemic is a disease outbreak where several people become severely ill with the same disease at the same time. However, unlike an epidemic, a pandemic spreads throughout the world and results in an extremely high illness and death rate unless prevention strategies are rapidly implemented. Members of t he World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believe there is a very strong chance the next pandemic will be a novel human influenza virus. Due to the increase in international relations across the globe, we will have considerably less time to respond than in years past. To date, our plans have focused on evacuating the university and responding when damage has occurred to university property. As the events of September 11, 2001 have taught us, we cannot wait to be presented with a crisis. We have to continually develop, refine and educate community members about how the university will respond. The threat of a pandemic has provided us with the potential for unprecedented operational issues due to a projected high absenteeism rate for an extended period of t ime. A pandemic will cause major disruptions at our health care provider offices, hospitals, transportation systems, suppliers and other public services . While this plan provides a thorough approach to the issues we anticipate needing to be addressed, there is a level of specificity that is dependant on the type of infectious agent involved . Therefore, the Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines serve as guidance only and provide actions that should be considered as events unfold. August 14, 2009 3 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines Goals and Assumptions Goals Our primary goal is to protect the safety and well-being of o ur students, faculty and staff by minimizing spread of t he disease. Our secondary goal is to ensure the ability to continue the essential functions of each college, school and unit. Assumptions The best protection from a pandemic is prevention and education prior to and during a disease outbreak. The novel human influenza virus will spread rapidly resulting in high illness and death rate. American University should close at Level 4 (a confirmed case in a 500-mile radius of Washington, DC). The virus will be highly contagious and will affect at least 25% of o ur population. A pandemic is likely to cause widespread and sustained effects which are likely to stress all local resources. There will be a 2-3 day incubation period without symptoms. Once symptoms occur, individuals will be sick for 7-10 days. Essential employees will be at a higher risk of e xposure and illness than the general population. If t he University shuts down, it should remain closed for a minimum of 7-10 weeks. When possible, instruction should continue via Black Board. Approximately 15% of re sident students will not be able to leave campus and will require on-campus housing during an outbreak. On-campus housing will still have AU network and internet access. The Student Health Center should have adequate supplies of N95 masks, goggles, gowns, etc. for appropriate personnel and should ensure standard precautions are in place. Essential employees should have been identified in Colleague by their department head. Departments should be responsible for identifying and recording unit essential services. August 14, 2009 4 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines Roles and Responsibilities Office of the Vice President of Finance and Treasurer The Office of the Vice President of Finance and Treasurer will oversee the Emergency Management Workgroup which will maintain and drill this plan. The workgroup should review the plan at least once a year and should provide the Cabinet with appropriate recommendations to update the plan. Cabinet The Cabinet should provide executive level direction and authority for this plan. During the response phase of the plan, they should make policy decisions on campus closure and the President, or his designee, should activate the plan. Emergency R esponse Team Th e Emergency Response Team is comprised of academic and operational managers with the appropriate expertise and knowledge of the campus to provide input or assist in the coordination of the preparation, implementation, evaluation and revision of the Emergency Management Plan. The Team's role in this plan is to provide the Cabinet with information so the Cabinet can make informed and appropriate decisions. Colleges/Schools/Units Each college, school, and unit should prepare its response to a pandemic outbreak. Guidance and a template can be found in Appendix II. For additional assistance creating an office or personal plan, contact the Director of Business Compliance in the office of Risk Management and Safety Services at 202/885-2722. All plans should describe ways to quickly contact those who are abroad, as well as, define \"essential travel\" and include a procedure identifying who can approve or cancel travel during a pandemic event. It is imperative that absenteeism be tracked as early as possible. If a department has more than 15 people and has an absenteeism rate of 30% or more, the Director of HR Delivery should be contacted. Human R esources It should be expected that during a pandemic outbreak, staffing levels will be strained. Reasons for absenteeism may include: caring for family members, personal August 14, 2009 5 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines illness, and school closures. The Director of H R Delivery should collect information from colleges/schools/units and report significant absentee p atterns to the E xecutive Director. The Director of HR Delivery o nly needs to be informed when 30% or more of a unit cannot work due to an illness. Being prepared at home can enable employees to continue t heir regular job duties. If e mployees need assistance creating their own personal emergency preparedness plan, they can contact the Director of Business Compliance at 202/885-2722. Pandemic Flu Levels There are 6 levels within the Pandemic Preparedness plan. Each level should be activated by the President based on information gathered by various district and federal agencies. August 14, 2009 6 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines Proactive Planning Level A pandemic has not occurred in this level of the plan. This level of the plan should last until there is a confirmed pandemic in another country. All college/school/unit plans should be updated and communication plans should be tested. The university should remain open with regularly scheduled classes and activities. Institution Wide: The Cabinet and Emergency Response Team should begin to communicate, as needed, with the campus community via campus website, text alert, Today @ AU postings, e-mail and voice mail messages. Campus community members should be encouraged to regularly check the Emergency Preparedness website (prepared.american.edu) for information updates. Department Specific : E mployees should familiarize themselves with the university leave and compensation policy. All departments should identify essential staff and back ups who are designated to maintain necessary operations. All departments should be prepared to reassign staff to meet temporary service needs. Communication protocols should be confirmed and tested for all department members. All departments should inventory their supplies and reorder more in anticipation of vendor disruption. Departments employing more than 15 people should be prepared to notify the Director of HR Delivery or designee if their department is missing 30% or more of their employees. Academic Affairs : A general awareness campaign should be developed through central university administration and the Student Health Center. The importance of Distance Education through the Center for Teaching Excellence and the Provost's initiatives on distance learning should be stressed. Incentives for faculty engaged in distance education delivery should be considered. Easily accessible distance learning training programs for faculty and students should be developed. Information on tuition cancellation insurance should be provided to all students and parents, if applicable, through the Office of Student Accounts. The situation overseas should be monitored via CDC, WHO, State Dept, OSAC Bulletins, national and international news and media outlets. A statement should be posted on the AU Abroad website describing how to keep informed, how to protect against possible contamination, etc. Information on pandemic preparedness and planning should be included in all pre- departure orientation programs. AU Abroad sites should be engaged in their own planning and preparations. August 14, 2009 7 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines AU Abroad Enclave Program overseas directors should supply AU Abroad with cost estimates for quarantine and shelter-in-place arrangements, should they become necessary, for students. Health and Safety : S tudent Health Center staff should review (and update as necessary) the SHC response plans each semester (currently occurs during July and January staff retreats).

August 14, 2009 46 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines Appendix I Emergency Planning - Pandemic Incident 5 00 Mile Radius - Washington DC August 14, 2009 47 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines Appendix II College/School/Unit Pandemic Continuity Procedures Guidelines for developing a Pandemic Continuity Procedures are outlined below: I. Planning and Coordination The assumptions listed at the beginning of this plan should be used when developing your individual plan. Your individual pandemic preparedness plans should go into affect once the President activates the University Pandemic Preparedness plan. II. Supplies and Inventory Each college/school/unit should complete an inventory of all supplies and equipment identified as essential to your ongoing business functions and establish a process to maintain an adequate inventory. Shortages of supplies may occur during a pandemic due to an increase in demand, transportation system disruption or inability of suppliers to meet the demand due to their own staffing shortages. The university will take reasonable steps to ensure that key suppliers are prepared to supply us with regular shipments in the event of a disruption. III. Identifying Alternative Methods to Deliver Classes and Services Each college/school/unit should consider what methods can be used to sustain essential services and classes. Alternatives should be identified that will assist in maintaining the university infrastructure, services, care of research projects, and continuation of classes. Alternative methods include, but are not limited to: a) Create redundancy in your list of essential personnel. b) Keep a small stockpile of essential supplies and consider how you will manage if they are not available. c) Identify work functions that must be done in the office and those that can be done remotely. Create work plans for those that can be done remotely. d) Work with colleagues to develop back up systems in the event of failures. IV. Faculty/Staff/Student Travel During a pandemic outbreak, a delicate balance should be achieved when limiting travel or imposing other travel restrictions. Keep in mind that highly impacted countries may be forced to close their borders. In addition, countries may impose quarantine periods and medical screening for incoming passengers. August 14, 2009 48 American University Pandemic Preparedness Guidelines Colleges/schools/units should develop methods to quickly contact AU community members who are abroad.

Avoid any unnecessary travel and cancel or postpone nonessential meetings, gatherings, workshops and training sessions. 4. Do not congregate in work rooms, pantries, copier rooms or other areas where people socialize. 5. Bring lunch and eat at your desk or away from others (avoid lunch rooms and crowded restaurants). 6. Encourage members and others to request information and orders via phone and e-mail in order to minimize person-to-person contact. Have the orders, materials and information ready for fast pick-up or delivery. Outside activities Employees might be encouraged to the extent possible to: 1. Avoid public transportation (walk, cycle, drive a car) or go early or late to avoid rush-hour crowding on public transportation. 2. Avoid recreational or other leisure classes, meetings, activities, etc. where employees might come into contact with contagious people.
