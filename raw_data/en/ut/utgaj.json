NTIL ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO, the term \"medicine\" stood alone, requiring no further description or adjective. Practitioners of the healing arts who were not doctors or nurses of medicine were called quacks. Today, what was once just \"medicine\" has become \"mainstream\" medicine, \"convention- al\" medicine, or \"allopathic\" medicine. Meanwhile, some of the erstwhile quacks are now practitioners of \"alternative\" medicine or \"complementary\" medicine. The wall between mainstream medicine and alternative medicine used to be impene- trable. For instance, the American Medical Association's Principles of Medical Ethics for- bade physicians from collaborating with all varieties of alleged quacks, including chiro- practors, podiatrists, and even osteopaths.1-2 It aggressively worked to stifle such associations through its Committee on Quackery.1 How the world has changed. Today the AMA's harsh strictures against consorting with the alternative practitioners has eased, to the point where the AM A journals will soon be publishing entire issues devoted to the topic of alternative medicine.3 Although there are cer- tainly real quacks still out there, the tag is far less liberally applied, and the fashion these days is to look for value in unconventional approaches to illness and wellness. Most physicians are now well aware that many of their patients are consumers of some form of alternative medicine. As Vann4 point- ed out in a recent issue of the Journal, sales of herbal medicine alone have reached $2.5 bil- lion a year. As much as $14 billion a year may be spent on all types of alternative treatments.3 The challenge for today's physicians is to keep abreast of what their patients may be doing, and keep the lines of communication open. M WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE? The term \"alternative\" medicine implies that its treatments, such as homeopathy and herbal medicine, are often used instead of convention- al medical therapies. Complementary medi- cine, on the other hand, suggests that conven- tional and complementary treatments are not mutually exclusive and may be used together, such as acupuncture or biofeedback in a patient undergoing conventional medical treatment for a painful arthritic condition. However, there is a considerable blurring of hew these terms are used, with \"alternative medicine\" often being used to describe any unconvention- al method of diagnosis and treatment. m HOW DOES ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MESH WITH MAINSTREAM MEDICINE? Some recent articles in the mainstream med- ical literature have proposed that complemen- tary medicine is preferable to the use of uncon- ventional treatments that discourage main- stream treatments.5^7 Numerous surveys show that the majority of practicing physicians, especially generalists, see value in at least some forms of alternative medicine.8-14 However, not all forms of alternative medicine are con- sidered equally complementary or useful, and there is a spectrum of disciplines ranging from quackery on the far left to conventional medi- cine on the right. Particularly favored were chiropractic, acupuncture, and hypnosis, less so homeopathy and diet therapy, and least favored were reflexology, iridology, faith heal- ing, and Native American traditional medi- cine.\u00ab. 10.13 In 1992 Congress mandated that the NIH create the Office of Alternative Medicine The challenge is to keep a dialogue open with patients CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 65 NUMBER 4 APRIL 1998 215 on September 17, 2023.

An advisory board was appointed in 1994, and seven different broad areas for study were identified: alternative systems of medical practice; bioelectromagnetic applications; control; and pharmacological and biological treatments.15 The Office has established and funded centers for alternative medicine in cancer, women's health, stroke and neurological rehabilitation, HIV and AIDS, pain (two centers), aging, addictions, internal medicine, asthma and allergy, and chiropractic. The 1998 budget for the OAM is projected at $20 million, a 67% increase over the 1997 budget.16 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD Despite all this attention, data on efficacy of various alternative modalities leave a lot to be desired.17 For example, although over 150 controlled trials of homeopathy have been reported, only 15% to 20% of these studies are considered \"good\" by the OAM.16 A recent Medline search for articles on alternative medicine for the years 1992 to 1997 yielded 96 references, of which only 30 reported data, and all of the latter were opinion surveys of either patients or physicians. Part of the problem is difficulty in per- forming valid controlled trials, since people who are receptive to unconventional treat- ment may differ from those who are not recep- tive to alternative treatments. For example, Begbie et al18 found that, among cancer patients, satisfaction with alternative thera- pies correlated positively with younger age and marriage and negatively with good responses to conventional treatment. Blais et al19 found that users and nonusers of alterna- tive medicine differed in age, activity, educa- tion, and income. On the other hand Boisset and Fitzcharles20 were unable to confirm these findings in a group of rheumatology patients, as were Elder et al21 in family practice patients. While Furnham and Smith22 found no differences in sex, age, education, marital status, religion, or income between patients consulting a general practitioner vs those see- ing a homeopath, they did identify a \"higher psychiatric morbidity\" among those seeking homeopathic treatment. All of this disagree- ment about the validity of research into alter- native medicine just adds to the confusion sur- rounding this issue. Another difficulty in studying alternative medicines is the standardization of treatments. As Vann4 pointed out, many herbal prepara- tions are not standardized for ingredients or potency. Many herbal preparations with the same name may contain different blends of ingredients at different dosages. Some grumpy souls in the medical estab- lishment continue to dismiss all of alternative medicine by emphasizing its shortcomings. Physicians are particularly concerned when patients delay obtaining effective standard treatment to try alternative treatments, such as homeopathic methods, possibly leading to avoidable but irreversible damage.23 Substitution of ineffective alternative treat- ments for more effective conventional ones can also have dire consequences.24 Direct ill effects of alternative interventions, for exam- ple acupuncture in diabetics, can also be disas- trous.25 A sign of the growing power and afflu- ence of the alternative medicine industry: the malpractice attorneys are licking their chops.26 WAITING FOR DATA As we consider the pros and cons of alternative treatments, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between the underevaluated and the ineffective. Considering the medical com- munity's pragmatism, it may seem unlikely that truly effective therapies will long go unused. Nonetheless, this can happen, and a case in point is the three decades that elapsed between the introduction of methotrexate and its now widespread use in rheumatoid arthritis. Physicians clearly are much more broadmind- ed today about unconventional approaches than they were in the past, but they rightly continue to demand that proposed treatments be subjected to the rigors of scientific evalua- tion. The establishment of the OAM is a posi- tive step toward making sure that this occurs and that real quackery is exposed for what it is. At the same time, we as physicians are faced with the problem that many of our patients are taking treatments for which there CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 65 NUMBER 4 APRIL 1998 216 on September 17, 2023.

Many herbal medicines have effects, side effects, and drug interactions that are potentially serious. And reliance on other alternative therapies can undermine compli- ance with proven, conventional treatments. The challenge for us is to keep the dia- logue open with our patients, so we know what they are doing and can advise them, in a nonjudgmerital fashion, about potential dan- gers of these treatments. \u00fc 1 JOHN D.
