Background The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) provides a comprehensive system of HIV primary medical care, essential support services, and medications for low -income people with HIV. The program funds grants to states, cities, counties, and local community -based organizations to provide care and treatment services to people with HIV to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV transmission among hard-to -reach populations. The RWHAP has five statutorily defined Parts (Parts A, B, C, D and F) that provide funding for core medical, support services, and medications; technical assistance; clinical training; and t he development of innovative models of care to meet the needs of different communities and populations affected by HIV. An important framework in the RWHAP is the HIV care continuum, which depicts the series of stages a person with HIV engages in from initial diagnosis through their successful treatment with HIV medication to achieve viral suppression. Supporting people wit h HIV to reach viral suppression not only increases their own quality of life and lifespan, it also prevents sexual transmission to an HIV -negative partner. The HIV care continuum framework allows recipients and planning groups to measure progress and t o direct HIV resources most effectively. RWHAP recipients are encouraged to assess the outcomes of their programs and should work with their community and public health partners to improve outcomes across the HIV care continuum. HRSA encourages recipients to use the performance measures developed for the RWHAP at their local level to assess the efficacy of their programs and to analyze and improve the gaps along the HIV care cont inuum. Strategic Frameworks and National Objectives National objectives and strategic frameworks like the Healthy People 2030, the HIV National Strategic Plan: A Roadmap to End the HIV Epidemic (2021 - 2025) ; the Sexually Transmitted Infections National Strategic Plan for the United States (2021 - 2025) ; and the Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination (2021 - 2025) are crucial to addressing key public health challenges facing low -income people with HIV. These strategies detail the principl es, priorities, and actions to guide the national public health response and provides a blueprint for collective action across the federal government and other sectors . The RWHAP supports the implementation of these strategies and recipients should align their organization's efforts, within the parameters of the RWHAP statute and program guidance, with these strategies to extent possible. Expanding the Effort: Ending the HIV Epidemic According to recent data from the 2019 Ryan White Services Report (RSR), the RWHAP has made tremendous progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. From 2015 to 2019, HIV viral suppression among RWHAP patients who have had one or more medical visits during the calendar year and at least one viral load with a result of <200 copies/mL reported, has increased from 83.4 percent to 88.1 percent. Additionally, racial/ethnic, age-based, and regional disparities reflected in viral suppression rates have ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 3 significantly decreased.1 For example, the disparities in viral suppression rates between Black/African Americans and white clients have decreased since 2010.2 These improved outcomes mean more people with HIV in the United States will live near normal lifespans and have a reduced risk of transmitting HIV to others.3 In February 2019, the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative was launched to further expand federal efforts to reduce HIV infections. This 10-year initiative seeks to achieve the important goal of reducing new HIV infections in the United States to fewer than 3,000 per year by 2030. The initiative promotes and implements four strategies to substantially reduce HIV transmissions - Diagnose, Treat, Prevent, and Respond. T he initiative is a collaborative effort among key HHS agencies, primarily HRSA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Indian Health Service (IHS), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Servic es Administration (SAMHSA). For the RWHAP, the EHE initiative expands the program's ability to meet the needs of clients specifically focusing on linking people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, diagnosed but currently not in care, or are diagnosed in care but not yet virally suppressed to the essential HIV care and treatment and support services needed to help them achieve viral suppression. Using Data Effectively: Integrated Data Sharing and Use HRSA and CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention support integrated data sharing, analysis, and utilization for the purposes of program planning, conducting needs assessments, determining unmet need estimates, reporting, quality improvement, enhancing the HIV care continuum, and public health action. HRSA strongly encourages RWHAP recipients to: Follow the principles and standards in the Data Security and Confidentiality Guidelines for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Disease, and Tuberculosis Programs: Standards to Facilitate Sharing and Use of Surveillance Data for Public Health Action . Establish data sharing agreements between surveillance and HIV programs to ensure clarity about the process and purpose of the data sharing and utilization. Integrated data sharing, analysis, and utilization of HIV data by state and territorial health departments can help further progress toward reaching the HIV National Strategic Plan goals and improve outcomes on the HIV care continuum. HRSA strongly encourages complete CD4, viral load (VL) and HIV nucleotide sequence reporting to the state and territorial health departments' HIV surveillance systems to benefit fully from integrated data sharing, analysis, and utilization. State health departments may use C D4, VL, and nucleotide sequence data to identify cases, stage of HIV disease at 1 Health Resources and Services Administration. Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Annual Client -Level Data Report 2019. http://hab.hrsa.gov/data/data- reports . Published December 2020. Accessed December 2, 2020. 2 Black/African American clients went from 79.4 percent viral suppression in 2015 to 85.2 percent in 2019, while 88.3 percent of white clients were virally suppressed in 2015 and 91.8 percent in 2019 3 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Preventing Sexual Transmission of HIV with Anti-HIV Drugs. In: ClinicalTrials.gov [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National Library diagnosis, and monitor disease progression. These data can also be used to evaluate HIV testing and prevention efforts, determine entry into and retention in HIV care, measure viral suppression, monitor prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance, detect transmission clusters and understand transmission patterns, and assess unmet health care needs. Analyses at the national level to monitor progress toward ending the HIV epidemi c can only occur if all HIV -related CD4, VL, and HIV nucleotide sequence test results are reported by all jurisdictions. CDC requires the reporting to the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) all HIV -related CD4 results (counts and percentages), all VL results (undetectable and specific values), and HIV nucleotide sequences. Program Resources and Innovative Models HRSA has a number of projects and resources that may assist RWHAP recipients with program implementation. These include a variety of HRSA HAB cooperative agreements, contracts, and grants focused on specific technical assistance (TA), evaluation, and intervention activities. A list of these resources is available on TargetHIV . Recipient s should be familiar with these resources and are encouraged to use them as needed to support their program implementation. In addition, many RWHAP Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) projects have demonstrated promising new approaches for linking and retaining priority populations into care. As resources permit , RWHAP recipients are encouraged to review and integrate these tools within their HIV system of care in accordance with the allowable s ervice categories defined in PCN 16 -02 Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Services: Eligible Individuals and Allowable Uses of Funds . Examples of these resources include: E2i: Using Evidence -Informed Interventions to Improve Health Outcomes among People Living with HIV E2i uses an implementation science approach to evaluate and understand existing and new intervention strategies that can be used in RWHAP provider settings. Once interventions or strategies are demonstrated and evaluated using implementation science, manuals, guides, interactive online tools, publications, and instructional materials are developed and disseminated for replication and integration into RWHAP provider settings. Integrating HIV Innovative Practices (IHIP) Resources on the IHIP website include easy -to-use training manuals, curricula, case studies, pocket guides, monographs, and handbooks, as well as informational handouts and infographics about SPNS generally. IHIP also hosts TA training webinars designed to provide a more interactive experience with experts, and a TA help desk exists for you to submit additional questions and share your own lessons learned. Replication Resources from the SPNS Systems Linkages and Access to Care There are intervention manuals for patient navigation, care coordination, state bridge counselors, data to care, and other interventions developed for use at the state and regional levels to address specific HIV care continuum outcomes among hard-to -reach HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 5 Dissemination of Evidence Informed Interventions The Dissemination of Evidence-Informed Interventions initiative ran from 2015-2020 and disseminated four adapted linkage and retention interventions from prior SPNS and the Minority HIV/AIDS Funds (MHAF) from the HHS Secretary's Office initiatives to improve health outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The initiative produced four evidence- informed care and treatment interventions (CATIs) that are replicable, cost -effective, capable of producing optimal HIV care continuum outcomes, and easily adaptable to the changing healthcare environment. Manuals are currently available at the link provided and will be updated on an ongoing basis. HRSA HAB also recognizes the importance of addressing emerging issues, as well as supporting the needs of special populations. To help recipients in responding to these critical issues, HRSA HAB f unds projects to provide technical assistance and resources for recipients. Examples of projects include: Building Futures: Supporting Youth Living with H IV The Center for Engaging Black MSM Across the Care Continuum (CEBACC) Using Community Health Workers to Improve Linkage and Retention in Care Social determinants of health (SDOH) are conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. They include factors like socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood and physical environment, community violence, employment, and social support networks, as well as acc ess to health care. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is among these factors that can disproportionately affect underserved communities. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), IPV describes physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse, and can have both direct and indirect effects on individual, family, and community health. In 2017, HRSA launched its Strategy to Address IPV , an effort to address this critic al social determinant of health through agency -wide collaborative action. The Strategy includes four priority areas including (1) Training the nation's health workforce, (2) Building partnerships to raise awareness, (3) Increasing access to quality care, and (4) Addressing gaps in knowledge about IPV risks, impacts, and interventions. Applicants are encouraged to consider one or more of these priority areas, as relevant, in the development and measurement of their initiative. Additional resources to assist you in determining how to effectively address intimate partner violence in your HRSA -funded programs may be found in the HRSA Strategy to Address IPV . II. Award Information 1. Type of Application and Award Types of applications sought: New and Competing Continuation. ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 6 HRSA will provide funding in the form of a grant. 2. Summary of Funding HRSA estimates approximately $180 ,600,000 to be available annually to fund 347 recipients with three (3) different periods of performance start dates. You may apply up to the published ceiling amount in Appendix B per year. The actual amount available will not be determined until enactment of the final FY 202 2 federal budget. This program announcement is subject to the appropriation of funds and is a contingency action taken to ensure that, should funds become available for this purpose, applications can be processed, and funds can be awar ded in a timely manner. The funding announcement has three (3) period of performance start dates (see table below). Applications must be complete, within the specified page limit, and validated by Grants.gov prior to the deadline to be considered under this NOFO . Be sure to submit the application under the correct funding opportunity number. Funding Opportunity Number Period of Performance HRSA -22-011 January 1, 2022 through December 31, 202 4 HRSA -22-014 April 1, 202 2 through March 31, 202 5 HRSA -22-015 May 1, 2022 through April 30, 2025 Funding for each period of performance will be for three (3) years . Funding beyond the first year is subject to the availability of appropriated funds for RWHAP Part C HIV EIS Program: Existing Geographic Service Ar eas in subsequent fiscal years, satisfactory recipient performance, and a decision that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government. In FY 2018 , HRSA implemented a systematic revision of the distribut ion of RWHAP Part C funding to ensure that it is awarded across service areas based on the following objective RWHAP data: the number and current demographics of clients served, HIV -related health disparities, and the number of uninsured clients. The RWHAP Part C funding methodology ensures baseline funding for the maintenance of program operations , minimizes disruptions by constraining the maximum allowable decrease in funding, and maintains the provision of quality HIV care in existing service areas. For this c ompetition, HRSA has again used the funding methodology to determine the funding ceiling amount per service area under this NOFO, which continues to be a competitive, discretionary grant opportunity. The RWHAP Part C funding methodology uses quantitative data primarily from the RSR to allocate funds to grant service areas in a more streamlined and consistent manner , achiev ing a reasonable and sustainable allocation of resources to improve health outcom es for people with HIV . Similar to FY 2018, t he RWHAP Part C funding methodology includes the following proportions and objective factors: 1) 70 percent of funding is base funding (minimum award amount of $100,000 4 per service area augmented by an amount corresponding to the number of eligible Part C clients served in that area as reported through the 2019 RSR); and 2) 30 percent of funding is based on a) demographics as reported through the 2019 RSR (limited to the service area's proportion of populations 4 Due to efforts to constrain the degree of change in funding experienced by each service area, there is one service area whose base award amount is slightly lower than $100,000. ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 7 disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic with significant disparities in health outcomes, including men of color who have sex with men, women of color, people who inject drugs, youth aged 13-24, transgender individuals, and uninsured populations), and b) RWHAP Part A resources (RWHAP Part C service areas outside of RHWAP Part A jurisdictions will receive additional funding). Future iterations of the RWHAP Part C funding methodology may include new proportions in funding and factors , such as performance in HIV viral suppression, to ensure that the funding allocation across service areas will be responsive to HIV health disparities and the changing demographics of the HIV epidemic, as well as the evolving health care landscape. To maintain continued access to high quality HIV primary care and support services, funds will continue to be awarded across existing service areas. Existing service areas will be kept intact, as described in this NOFO. Under this three-year award, HRSA has constrained the degree of change in funding. The funding ceiling amounts in Appendix B reflect the implementation of this methodology . HRSA encourages current RWHAP Part C recipients to assess their history of expending Part C funds and to examine all resources available, including program income generated as a result of the RWHAP Part C award, when they consider the funding level for which to apply . Appendix B describes the ceiling amount for each service area; applicants can request a funding level that is less than the listed amount in light of their history of expending Part C funds and availabi lity of other resources. HRSA HAB anticipates directing any balance in funds to support the funding of new RWHAP Par t C service areas where there is the greatest burden of infection, illness, and di sparities from HIV , as well as to support the RWHAP Part C C apacity Development grant program. In addition, HRSA reserves the right to fund less than the amount requested based on a history of current RWHAP Part C recipients ' unobligated balances. All HRSA awards are subject to the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements at 45 CFR part 75 . III. Eligibility Information 1.

However, recipients must coordinate these services with other HIV prevention and testing programs to avoid duplication of effort. Linkages and formal referral mechanisms should be established to ensure follow - up care and t reatment for those persons identified as having HIV. Please note that RWHAP Part C funds cannot (1) supplant CTR efforts paid for by other sources, or (2) support routine CTR services in the general patient population, or testing activities in the general population. If HIV CTR is provided, these services must comply with sections 2661 to 2663 of the PHS Act. The revised HHS Guidelines for CTR are available at: http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines . The CT R program also must assure the confidentiality of patient information in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or non-occupational post -exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) is intended for persons who do not hav e HIV; therefore, RWHAP Part C funds shall not be used to pay for PrEP or nPEP medication or associated medical services. However, RWHAP recipients, including Part C providers, may ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 11 provide services such as counseling and targeted testing, which should be part of a comprehensive PrEP program. For further guidance, please see the HAB Program Letter on PrEP. Medical Care Evaluation and Clinical Care - RWHAP Part C recipients must provide comprehensive patient -centered primary health care services in an outpatient setting for low income people with HIV throughout their entire designated service area (see Appendix B ). In addition, recipients must ensure, directly or via referral, access for clients to core medical services as described in HAB PCN 16 -02. If a program is unable to provide any of these services directly , it must enter into formal arrangements, such as contracts or MOUs , with appropriate providers. Recipients must also be able to diagnose, provide prophylaxis, and treat or refer clients with tuberculosis, Hepatitis B or C, and sexually transmitted infections. Program -wide clinical protocols should be in place to address these co- morbidities. In addi tion, program clinical staff should track and coordinate all inpatient care. They should develop plans for the resumption of patient care in the program if a patient has been discharged from the hospital or if there is any other disruption in outpatient care. Finally, recipients must also have a system in place for after -hours and weekend clinical coverage for medical and dental services ; and patients must be involved and fully educated about their medical needs and treatment options within the standards of medical care. Clinical Guidelines - All clinical care must be provided in accordance with HHS Guidelines, which can be found on the HIV.GOV website at: https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines . You are strongly encouraged to require, at least yearly, continuing education opportunities for RWHAP Part C program staff to ensure they remain knowledgeable of clinical advances in the treatment of HIV and are familiar with the most recent HHS Guidelines. Referral Systems - A process must be in place for referring patients to needed health care and support services such as oral health, specialty care, medical case management, etc . The referral system should include the tracking and monitoring of those referrals, including the documentation of the referral's outcome in the medical record so that follow -up may occur. Linkage to Clinical Trials - A plan must be in place for referring appropriate patients to biomedical research facilities or community -based organizations that conduct HIV -related clinical trials. For information on these protocols, visit the NIH HIV Clinical Trials Network website at: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/hiv - research-enterprise Clinical Quality Management - Section 2664(g)(5) of the PHS Act requires RWHAP Part C recipients to establish a CQM program to: (1) assess the extent to which HIV health services provided to patients under the grant are consistent with HHS Guidelines for the treatment of HIV and related opportunistic infections, (2) develop strategies for ensuring that such services are consistent with the guidelines for improvement in the access to quality HIV health services, and (3) ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 12 ensure that improvements in the access and quality of HIV health services are addressed. Please see HAB PCN 15 -02 Clinical Quality Management and related Frequently Asked Questions for PCN 15-02 for information on CQM program requirements. Coordination/Linkages to Other Programs - Coordination must occur with all available and accessible community resources, such as federally -funded and non- federally -funded programs (e.g., substance use disorder treatment, mental health treatment, homelessness, housing, other support service programs). This may also include other publicly funded entities providing primary care services, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and behavioral health treatment service organizations, including those funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). HRSA expects r ecipients to collaborate with entities that provide ongoing HIV prevention activities and establish formal linkages with them for referral of people with HIV into care and treatment services at your site. HRSA expects applicants located near existing RWHAP Part C funded programs to coordinate/collaborate with those programs and to avoid duplication of services provided in the service area. A searchable RWHAP recipient database is available at: http://findhivcare.hrsa.gov/index.html . In addition, HRSA requires successful applicants to coordinate services with other RWHAP providers, including Parts A, B, D, Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS), AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC s), the Dental Reimbursement Program, and the Community -Based Dental Partnership Program. HRSA encourages successful applicants located in an Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) or a Transitional Grant Area (TGA) to participate in the activities of the RWHAP Part A Planning Council and demonstrate that they have coordinated with and not duplicated Part A services. HRSA encourages RWHAP Part C recipients to participate in the RWHAP Part B state/territory planning body and/or RWHAP Part B HIV Care Consortium. Further, HRSA expects RWHAP Part C recipients to provide services consistent with their jurisdiction's Integrated HIV Prev ention and Care Plan, including the Statewide Coordinated Statement of Need. Medicaid Provider Status - All providers of services available under the state Medicaid plan must have entered into a participation agreement under the state plan and be qualified to receive payments under such plan, or receive a waiver from this requirement. This requirement may be waived for entities with which RWHAP Part C recipients have an agreement to provide services under the award that do not impose a charge or accept reimbursement available from any third- party payer, including reimbursement under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State health benefits program . Recipients providing services directly pursuant to the award will not be eligible for a waiver. Clinic Licensure - Primary medical care providers and case management agencies must be fully licensed to pr ovide clinical and case management services, as required by their state and/or local jurisdiction (see Attachment 13). ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 13 Administrative/Fiscal Requirements : Consumer Involvement - People with HIV who receive services at a RWHAP - funded organization should be actively involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of program and CQM activities. To receive effective input from people with HIV , programs should provide necessary training, m entoring, and supervision. Examples of involvement include but are not limited to the following: o Representation on the organization's Board of Directors. o Representation on a newly established or existing consumer advisory board. o Recruiting people with HIV to serve as volunteer peer trainers to work directly with patients to help them address issues related to making healthy decisions, treatment decisions and adherence, gaining access to clinical trials, and chronic disease self - management, etc. o Participation on workgroups, committees , and task forces, such as a Quality Committee, a Linkage/Retention initiative, or a Patient Education Committee. o Serving as peer educators, outreach workers, or staff in the clinic, with fair and equi table pay for the job they are hired to perform. o Participation through patient satisfaction and needs assessment surveys, forums, and focus groups. Imposition of Charges for Services - Patients cannot be denied services if they are unable to pay. The RWHAP statute prohibits imposing a charge on individuals whose income is at or below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and requires that recipients impose a charge on individuals with incomes greater than 100 percent of the FPL, according to a publicly available schedule of charges . o Annual Cap on Charges - The RWHAP statute requires recipients to limit the amount of charges for HIV -related services they can impose on patients per year : Individual Income Maximum Charge * At or below 100 percent of FPL N/A - no charge 101 to 200 percent of FPL No more than 5 percent of annual gross income 201 to 300 percent of FPL No more than 7 percent of annual gross income Over 300 percent of FPL No more than 10 percent of annual gross income o *Waiver of imposition of charges requirements: Entities operating as free clinics, meaning those that do not impose a charge or accept reimbursement available from any third party payer, may request a waiver of the imposition of charges requirements from H RSA. ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 14 Recipients must track the patient's income and charges imposed and have a system in place to ensure that they are able to cap out -of-pocket charges. Payor of Last Resort - With the exception of programs administered by or providing the services of the Indian Health Service, the RWHAP is the payor of last resort. RWHAP Part C funds may not be used for a service if payment has been made, or reasonably can be expected to be m ade by a State compensation program, an insurance policy, a Federal or State health benefits program, or by an entity that provides health services on a pre-paid basis . In accordance with the RWHAP client eligibility determination and recertification requirements (see HAB Program Letter on Rapid Eligibility and HAB PCN 13 -02 Clarifications on Ryan White Program Client Eligibility Determinations and Recertification Requirements ), HRSA expects clients' eligibility to be assessed during the initial eligibility determination and recertified at least every six months. At least once a year (whether defined as a 12-month period or calendar year), the recertification procedures should include the collection of more in-depth information, similar to that collected at the initial eligibility determination. The purposes of the eligibility and recertification procedures are to ensure that the program only serves eligible clients and that the RWHAP is the payor of last resort. Recipients and subrecipients are required to vigorously pursue and rigorously document enrollment into, and subsequent reimbursement from, health care coverage for which their clients may be eligible (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), state-funded HIV/AIDS programs, employer - sponsored health insurance coverage, health plans offered through other private health insurance) to extend finite RWHAP grant resources to low income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. RWHAP Part C funds cannot be used to supplement the maximum cost allowance for services reimbursed by third party paye rs such as Medicaid, Medicare, or other insurance programs. Please note that recipients cannot use direct or indirect federal funds such as RWHAP Parts A, B, D , and F Dental to duplicate reimbursement for services funded under Part C. Additionally, recipients cannot bill services reimbursed by RWHAP Part C to RWHAP Parts A, B, D, or F. Information Systems - Recipients must have an information system that has the capacity to manage and report at a minimum, the following administrative, fiscal, and clinical data: o Client Demographic/Clinical Data and Service Provision Data as required by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Services Report (RSR) - see the most recent Annual RSR Instruction Manual ; o Source and use of program income; o Services according to funding source; o Time and effort supported by grant funds; and o Number of people with HIV who received specific core medical and support services by funding source. Service Availability - HIV medical services should be available to clients no later than 90 days from the RWHAP Part C EIS award issuance -22-014, HRSA -22-015 15 Subawarded Services - information included in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.352 , subrecipient agreements must include: (1) the total number of people with HIV to be served; (2) eligibility for Medicaid certification of the medical providers and ambulatory care facilities; (3) details of the services to be provided; and (4) assurance t hat providers will comply with RWHAP Part C legislative and program requirements, including data sharing, submission of the RSR , and participation in the CQM program. Per 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 75.351 - .353, recipients must monitor the activities of their subrecipients as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes, in compliance with federal statutes, RWHAP legislative and programmatic requirements, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward; and that subaward performance goals are achieved. Rec ipients must ensure that subrecipients track, appropriately use, and report program income generated by the subaward. Recipients must also ensure that subrecipient expenditures adhere to legislative mandates regarding the distribution of funds. Medication Discounts - HRSA expects RWHAP grant recipients that purchase, are reimbursed for, or provide reimbursement to other entities for outpatient prescription drugs to secure the best prices available for such products and to maximize results for their organization and its patients (see 42 CFR part 50, subpart E ). Eligible health care organizations/covered entities that enroll in the 340B Drug Pricing Program must comply with all 340B Program requirements and will be subject to audit regarding 340B Program compliance. 340B Program requirements, including eligibility, can be found at: https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/ . Program Income -- All program incom e generated as a result of awarded funds is considered additive and must be added to the grant amount and used for otherwise allowable costs to further the objectives of the RWHAP Part C grant program. Please see HAB PCN 15 -03 for more information on the RWHAP and program income. Other Financial Issues - Programs must have appropriate financial systems in place that pr ovide internal controls in safeguarding assets, ensuring stewardship of federal funds, maintaining adequate cash flow to meet daily operations, and maximizing revenue from non-federal sources.

If requesting a funding preference, include a narrative submitted as Attachment 8 . NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Criterion(1) Need The purpose of this section is to use quantifiable data to demonstrate the burden of the HIV epidemic in the designated service area and the need for RWHAP Part C funding to meet the outpatient primary health care and support service needs of the target population(s), particularly in relation to identified gaps and challenges in the HIV care continuum. There ar e two (2) required components of the needs assessment section: 1. Target populations currently being served by your organization; and ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 17 2. The local HIV service delivery system and any recent changes , including changes as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic . 1. Populations Currently Being Served by Your Organization Base t his overview on the most recent three years of HIV surveillance data available for the service area and the past three calendar years (CY) of data (i.e., CY18 , CY1 9, and CY20) for your patient population(s) . Clearly cite all data sources. Please address each bullet with a table and any associated narrative explanation. Describe the burden of HIV in the population(s) being served by your organization and compare it to the overall burden of HIV i n the service area using newly diagnosed cases (diagnosed incidence) and total number of people with diagnosed HIV (diagnosed prevalence) data. Present data by race, ethnicity, age, gender, and transmission categories to highlight particular disparities. Clearly describe if there are specific highly impacted groups (i.e., subpopulations) within the service area who have the greatest needs and who will be a focus for RWHAP Part C funded services. This demonstrates your intent to address the goals to end the HIV epidemic through the reduction of HIV -related health disparities. Identify any trends that have emerged during the last three years, including those related to the COVID -19 pandemic, such as any increases or decreases in HIV incidence/prevalence among specific subpopulations. Provide the above information in a table format. Describe the unmet need based on your evaluation of the gaps in the HIV care continuum for the population(s) of people with HIV who are served by your organization. Provide data on the five stages of the HIV care continuum for the identified focus population(s) with disparate rates of HIV using the most recent five calendar years of available data ( e.g., CY1 6 through CY20). The stages in the HIV care continuum are: diagnosis of HIV infection, linkage to care, retention in care, receipt of antiretroviral therapy, and achievement of viral suppression. Clearly define the numerator and the denominator for each stage. Use the s ame numerators and denominators as outlined for the HHS Common HIV Core Indicators . Provide the data in a table format. A detailed resource for how to calculate data indicators for each stage can be found here in the CDC's HIV Resource Library . The table may list the stages in the left hand column and, across the top of the table, list the measurement periods by calendar year ( each year as a separate column). Briefly describe how you used RWHAP Part A or B Unmet Need estimates of people with HIV in your own program and budget planning efforts. Include any subpopulations in the designated service area who (1) are unaware of their HIV status, or (2) know they hav e tested positive for HIV. 2. The Local HIV Service Delivery System and Recent Changes Describe the HIV services available to people with HIV in the entire designated service area and demonstrate how the proposed RWHAP Part C services will not duplicate other funded services. The presentation of the local HIV service delivery system should cover three broad areas: ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 18 HIV service providers a. Provide a map of the entire designated service area (as listed in Appendix B ) and show the locations of all current and proposed local providers of HIV outpatient primary health care services, including your organization. Include this map as Attachment 9 . b. List all public and private organizations (including any other RWHAP provider s) that provide HIV outpatient primary health care services to people with HIV in the entire designated service area. Provide a table listing (1) name of organization, (2) specific services each one provides, (3) target populations served, and if possible (4) the number of unduplicated clients served annually. The CDC and HRSA Integrated HIV Prevention and Care Plan , including the Statewide Coordinated Statement of Need , together with the RWHAP Part A and Part B Programs , may serve as r esources for this information. Gaps in local services and barriers to care Based on the unmet need and gaps in the HIV care continuum as described in the Needs Assessment section, describe where current HIV core medical and support services need strengthening. Describe any corresponding significant barriers (individual/structural) , including those arising from COVID -19 pandemic , that prevent people with HIV from accessing needed services and achieving improved outcomes in the entire designated ser vice area. Description of the Current Health Care Landscape Describe the health care environment and any significant changes that have affected the availability of health care services, including: a. Your clients by payor source in CY 20 (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, state- funded HIV programs, employer -sponsored health insurance coverage, other private health insurance, and/or other third-party payor). b. How the Medicaid program provides services to people with HIV in your state, including a description of eligibility, a listing of the HIV core medical and support services covered by Medicaid, and any gaps in coverage for these services . For example, identify if there are limits on the number of primary care or mental health visits, the types of oral health services that are reimbursable, medical/non- medical case management services, or prescription medication coverage. c. Any gaps in coverage for HIV core medical and support services from other major health care payor sources (e.g., employer -sponsored health insurance coverage, state -funded HIV programs, Medicare, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) funding, and/or other third-party payor) in the designated service area. For example, identify if there are limits on the number of primary care or ment al health visits, the types of oral health services that are reimbursable, medical/non-medical case management services, or prescription medication coverage. d. Any recent economic, system, or demographic shifts (e.g., in specific populations, closings of loc al hospitals, community health care providers, or major local employers) , public health emergencies such as COVID -19, or natural disasters that have affected care to your clients. METHODOLOGY -- Corresponds to Section V's Review Criterion(2) Response Utilizing the section headings provided below, describe the proposed outpatient core medical and support services you will provide to address the unmet needs/service ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 19 gaps/barriers identified in your needs assessment section. For example, if a service area is lacking access to oral health care, you should describe how you will address this unmet need in the Core Medical Services subsection, or if the HIV viral suppression rate is low (e.g., as compared to your state's average rate) among a specific subpopulation in your clinic, your application should address this gap in the HIV Care Continuum Services subsection.

Follow the instructions included in the Application Guide and the additional budget instructions provided below. A budget that follows the Application Guide will ensure that, ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 26 if HRSA selects the application for funding, you will have a well -organized plan and by carefully following the appr oved plan can avoid audit issues during the implementation phase. Reminder: The Total Project or Program Costs are the total allowable costs (inclusive of direct and indirect costs) incurred by the recipient to carry out a HRSA -supported project or activ ity. Total project or program costs include costs charged to the award and costs borne by the recipient to satisfy a matching or cost -sharing requirement, as applicable. In addition to the SF -424 Application Guide requirements, you must also provide the l ine item budget and budget narrative according to the following five allowable RWHAP Part C cost categories: EIS, Core Medical Services, Support Services, CQM, and Administrative Costs . 1) Early Intervention Services (EIS) Costs \u2014At least 50 percent of the amount received under the grant must be expended on the following Part C EIS costs, either directly or through referrals, contracts, or MOUs : Targeted HIV testing Other clinical and diagnostic services regarding HIV, and periodic medical evaluations for people with HIV Providing therapeutic measures for preventing and treating the deterioration of the immune system and for preventing and treating conditions arising from HIV Applicants must ensure that at least 50 percent of the award will be expended on targeted HIV testing, clinical and diagnostic services regarding HIV and periodic medical evaluations for people with HIV , and providing therapeutic medications . Clinical and diagnostic services may include medical case management, mental health, oral health, and other clinical services, in addition to outpatient ambulatory health services . The legislative budgetary requirement of at least 50 percent for the EIS Cost Category excludes counseling and referrals /linkage to care, although the budget allocation for these services cannot be zero (see next section) . 2) Core Medical Services Costs (At least 75 percent of the award - after reserving amounts for administrative costs, planning/evaluation, and clinical quality management - must be expended on core medical services.) Core medical services , by statute, include the following service categories (further described in HAB PCN 16 -02): AIDS Drug Assistance Program Treatments AIDS Pharmaceutical Assistance EIS o Counseling individuals with respect to HIV o Referrals /linkage to care Health Insurance Premiums and Cost Sharing Assistance for Low Income Individuals Home and Community -Based Health Services Home Health Care Hospice Medical Case Management, including Treatment Adherence Services Medical Nutrition Therapy Mental Health Services ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 27 Oral Health Care Outpatient/Ambulatory Health Services Substance Abuse Outpatient Care As a reminder, 50 percent of the award must be allocated to the EIS cost category , as described above in IV.2.iii.1. Since allocations for c ounseling and referrals/linkage to care cannot be zero, they must be allocated under the Core Medical Services cost category (not EIS cost category ). 3) Support Services Costs - Support services as described in HAB PCN 16 -02 are those services needed by people with HIV to achieve optimal HIV medical outcomes. These include: Child Care Services Emergency Financial Assistance Food Bank/Home Delivered Meals Health Education/Risk Reduction Housing Legal Services Linguistic Services Medical Transportation Non-Medical Case Management Services Other Professional Services Outreach Services Permanency Planning Psychosocial Support Services Rehabilitation Services Respite Care Substance Abuse Services (residential) 4) CQM Costs - CQM includes those costs required to implement HAB PCN 15 -02. This incorporates those costs required to assess the extent to which services are consistent with the current HHS Guidelines for the treatment of HIV and related opportunistic infections, develop strategies for ensuring such services are consistent with the guidelines, and ensure improvements are made in the access to and quality of HIV health services. Exam ples of CQM costs include CQM coordination; CQI activities; data collection for CQM purposes (collection, aggregation, analysis, development and implementation of a data-based strategy for CQI implementation); CQM staff training/technical assistance (including travel and registration) to improve clinical care services; attendance for approximately three staff members at the National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care and Treatment; training subrecipients on CQM; participation in the Integrated Plan process and local planning; and people with HIV involvement in the design, implementation, and evaluation to improve services. HRSA expects that grant funding spent on clinical quality management shall be kept to a reasonable level. 5) Administrative Costs - (Not more than 10 percent of the total RWHAP Part C grant award may be expended on administrative costs) - Administrative Costs are those direct and indirect costs associated with the administration of the RWHAP Part C EIS ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 28 grant. Staff activities that are administrative in nature should be allocated to administrative costs. Planning and evaluation costs are subject to the 10 percent cap.

Funding Restrictions The General Provisions in Division H, Title II of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) apply to this program . Please see Section 4.1 of HRSA's SF-424 Application Guide for additional information. Note that these or other restrictions will apply in the following FY, as required by law. You may request funding for up to three years, at an annual ceiling amount of no more than the amount listed in Appendix B for the service area to which you are applying. If you are applying for more than one service area listed in Appendix B, you must submit a separate application for each service area under the correct funding opportunity number. Each application must address the entire service area, as defined in Appendix B. Awards to support projects beyond the first budget year will be contingent upon Congressional appropriation, s atisfactory progress in meeting the project's objectives, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the federal government. In addition to the general funding restrictions included in Section 4.1.iv of the SF-424 Application Guide , you may not use funds under this announcement for the following purposes: Charges that are billable to third party payors (e.g., private health insurance, prepaid health plans, Medicaid, Medicare, HUD, other RWHAP funding including ADAP) Payments for clinical research Payments for nursing home care Cash payments to intended reci pients of RWHAP services Purchase or improvement of land Purchase, construction, or major alterations or renovations on any building or other facility (see 45 CFR part 75 - subpart A PrEP or nPEP medications or medical services. As outlined in the June 22, 2016 RWHAP and PrEP program letter , the RWHAP legislation provides grant funds to be used for the care and treatment of people with HIV , thus prohibiting the use of RWHAP funds for PrEP medications or related medical services, such as physician visits and laboratory costs. However, RWHAP Part C recipients and subrecipients may provide prevention counseling and information, which should be part of a comprehensive PrEP program. Purchase of sterile needles or syringes for the purposes of hypodermic injection of any illegal drug. Some aspects of Syringe Services Programs are allowable with HRSA's prior approval and in compliance with HHS and HRSA policy (see: https://www.hiv.gov/federal -response/policies -issues/syringe-services -programs s/). Development of materials designed to promote or encourage, directly, intravenous drug use or sexual activity, whether homosexual or heterosexual . Research Foreign travel Other non-allowable costs can be found in 45 CFR part 75 - subpart E Cost Principles. The RWHAP Part C statute requires recipients to expend at least 50 percent of their Part C grant on Part C EIS costs (except counseling and referral s/linkage to care); at least 75 percent of the award ( after reserving amounts for administrative costs, planning/evaluation, and clinical quality management) on core medical services costs; and not more than 10 percent of the on administrative costs. Please see HAB PCN 15 -01 and Frequently Asked Questions for PCN 15-01 regarding the statutor y 10 percent limitation on administrative costs. HRSA also expects that grant funding spent on clinical quality management will be kept to a reasonable level, consistent with Parts A and B. You are required to have the necessary policies, procedures, and financial controls in place to ensure that your organization complies with all legal requirements and restrictions applicable to the receipt of federal funding, including statutory restrictions on use of funds for lobbying, executive salaries, gun control, abortion, etc. Like those for all other applicable grants requirements, the effectiveness of these policies, procedures, and controls is subject to audit. Program Income All program income generated as a result of awarded funds is considered additive and must be added to the grant amount and used for otherwise allowable costs to further the objectives of the RWHAP Part C grant program. HHS award regulations require recipients and/or subrecipients to track and report program income. Program income shall be monitored by the recipient, retained by the recipient (or subrecipient if earned at the subrecipient level), and used to provide RWHAP Part C services to eligible clients . Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided on 45 CFR \u00a7 75.307(f). Program income inc ludes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 36 funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awar d, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them . Please see 45 CFR \u00a7 ions Regarding the RWHAP and Program Income for additional information. V. Application Review Information 1.

Review and Selection Process The objective review process provides an objective evaluation to the individuals responsible for making award decisions. The highest ranked applications receive consideration for award within available funding ranges. HRSA may also consider assessment of r isk and the other pre-award activities described in Section 3 below. In addition to the ranking based on merit criteria, HRSA approving officials will apply other factors (e.g., geographical distribution) described below in selecting applications for award. See Section 5.3 of HRSA's SF-424 Application Guide for more details . HRSA will consider past performance in managing contracts, grants and/or cooperative agreements of similar size, scope and complexity. Past performance includes timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded federal funds will be expended prior to future awards. For all service areas with two or more applicants, up to five additional points related to past performance (excluding performance during FY 2019 and FY 2020 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic) will be added to the objective review score. HRSA will consider the following: Compliance with terms and conditions of RWHAP Parts C and/or D award(s) issued in FY 2018, specifically the number of patients the recipient proposed to serve in their appli cation in relation to the actual number of patients served as reported in annual progress reports ( 1 point) Previously awarded federal funds in FY 2018 expended (1 point ) Timeliness of reporting in FY 2018 (1 point) Site visit report findings and progress on programmatic corrective action plans, if applicable (1 point) Financial assessment conducted by HRSA's Division of Financial Integrity. Financial assessments are a summary of key findings from single audits and/or RWHAP program -` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 40 specific audit s as an indicator of financial risk and its possible impact on program performance. (1 point) Funding Preferences This program provides a funding preference for some applicants as authorized by section 2653 of the PHS Act. Applicants receiving preference will be placed in a more competitive position among applications that can be funded. Applications that do not receive a funding preference will receive full and equitable consideration during the review process . Funding preference will be granted to any qualified applicant that justifies their qualification for the funding preference by demonstrating that they meet the criteria for preference(s) as follows: Qualification 1: Increased Burden - The Secretary shall give a funding preference to any qualified applicant experiencing an increased burden in providing HIV services. To request this preference, an applicant must provide information on ALL of the following factors for the service area: Number of cases of HIV; Rate of increase of HIV cases; Lack of availability of early intervention services; Number and rate of increase of cases of sexually transmitted infections , tuberculosis, substance use disorder , and co-infection with hepatitis B or C; Lack of availability of primary health care providers other than the applicant; Distance between the applicant's service area and the nearest community that has an adequate level of availability of appropriate HIV -related services, and the length of time required for patients to travel that distance. The relevant time period for qualifying for this preference is the two-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the applicant is applying to receive the grant. Additional Preference(s): Qualification 2: Rural Areas If you qualify for preference under Qualification 1, you may request an additional funding preference if you provide EIS in rural areas. Rural communities are those that are NOT designated a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). An MSA, as defined by OMB, m ust include one city with 50,000 or more inhabitants. MSAs are also urbanized areas (defined by the Bureau of the Census) with at least 50,000 or more inhabitants and a total MSA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). Rural communities may exist within the broad geographic boundaries of MSAs. For more information, see http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth/aboutus/definition.html . For a list of those areas, refer to https://data.hrsa.gov/ tools/rural -health . Qualification 3: Underserved Areas If you qualify for preference under Qualification 1, you may request an additional funding preference if you provide EIS in areas that are underserved with respect to EIS. The RWHAP funds EIS under Parts A, B, C , and D . Applicants requesting a funding preference based on an underserved qualification must demonstrate that the area has gaps in the provision of EIS for people with HI V. You must define and document these gaps and may ` HRSA -22-011, HRSA -22-014, HRSA -22-015 41 include inadequate and/or unavailable services or services that do not sufficiently target particular segments of any community. If requesting a funding preference, include a narrative justification as Attachment 8 . The justification must demonstrate the existence of ALL of the specified factors for Qualification 1: Increased burden, as described in section V.3, Funding Preference. Applicants who qualify for preference under Qualification 1 can request additional preferences under Qualification 2: Rural Areas and/or Qualification 3: Underserved Areas. The additional requests must also be justified in this attachment. The funding preferences must be explicitly justified in this attachment in order for HRSA to consider them . 3. Assessment of Risk HRSA may elect not to fund applicants with management or financial instability that directly relates to the organization's ability to implement statutory, regulatory or other requirement s (45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 ). HRSA reviews applications receiving a favorable objective review for other considerations that include past performance, as applicable, cost analysis of the project/program budget, assessment of your management systems, ensuring continued applicant eligibi lity, and compliance with any public policy requirements, including those requiring just -in-time submissions. HRSA may ask you to submit additional programmatic or administrative information (such as an updated budget or \"other support\" information) or to undertake certain activities (such as negotiation of an indirect cost rate) in anticipation of an award. However, even at this point in the process, such requests do not guarantee that HRSA will make an award. Following review of all applicable information, HRSA's approving and business management officials will determine whether HRSA can make an award, if special conditions are required, and what level of funding is appropriate. Award decisions are discretionary and are not subject to appeal to any HRSA or HHS official or board. Effective January 1, 2016, HRSA is required to review and consider any information about your organization that is in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPI IS). You may review and comment on any information about your organization that a federal awarding agency previously entered. HRSA will consider any of your comments, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about your organization's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed as described in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 HHS Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants . HRSA will report to FAPIIS a determination that an applicant is not qualified Award Administration Information 1.
