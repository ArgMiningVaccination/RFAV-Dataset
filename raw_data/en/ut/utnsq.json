The Damask rose is native to Northern Persia (modern Iran) and thrives in open, sunny positions. It is a deciduous shrub growing to 2.4 metres tall, the stems have stout, curved prickles and stiff bristles. The leaves are pinnate, with five leaflets. The roses are a light to moderate pink to light red. The relatively small flowers grow in groups. Rosa damascena is mainly cultivated in Bulgaria, Turkey and Morocco, but is grown in other areas around the world. Common method of extraction: Steam distillation (Shugian, et al., 2017) Part typically used: Petals Colour: [Rose Otto essential oil](https://www.baseformula.com/rose-otto-essential-oil) is colourless to Odour: Deep-floral, slightly spicy odour Perfumery note: Middle Yield: Requires 5 tons of rose petals to produce 1 litre of rose oil Chemical composition: Typical notable chemical composition Rose Historical facts and traditional uses: Roses have been used by mankind for thousands of years. The Ancient Egyptians used them for skincare and fragrancing, and up until the Middle Ages they were also traditionally used as a medicine; Pliny listed 32 rose-based remedies. Roses became a symbol of pleasure during Roman times and were used in many different circumstances, for example as decorations at celebrations, weddings, festivals, for strewing on the floor and in perfumery and cosmetics. The Crusader Robert de Brie is given credit for bringing the Damask rose from Persia to Europe sometime between 1254 and 1276. The rose is named after the city of Damascus in Syria and is renowned for its fine fragrance. Rose oil and rose water (also called [Rose Hydrolat](https://www.baseformula.com/gels-hydrolats/hydrolats/rose-otto-hydrolat)) are commonly used in perfumery and cosmetics, and the petals (which are edible) and rose water can also be used for culinary purposes to decorate or flavour food.

Additional information: Rose otto (Rosa damascena) is extracted through steam distillation, producing a pure or true essential oil, whilst [Rose Absolute](https://www.baseformula.com/aromatherapy/aromatherapy-oils/absolute-oils/rose-damascena-absolute-oil) is extracted by solvent extraction, producing an 'absolute' rather than a pure or true oil. The aroma of Rose otto isn't as intense as the absolute, but it is still highly concentrated and a little goes a long way. Rose otto oil is more expensive, as the yield from steam distillation is lower than that of solvent extraction. It is useful to note however that some clients may have skin sensitivity to 'absolute' oils, due to traces of solvent residue remaining in the oil. Research studies: Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. A study was undertaken exploring the effects of Rose essential oil delaying Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms. Results indicated direct evidence on Rose essential oil for treating Alzheimer's disease on an organism level providing an indication that it may be used medicinally (Shugian, et al., 2017). A study was designed to determine the effect of Rose Otto oil (Rosa damascena) in inhalation and foot bath on the improvement of maternal and neonatal health outcomes. 80 women were randomly assigned to aromatherapy and control groups. The Aromatherapy group received inhalation and a foot bath with rose essential oil for 10 minutes at the beginning of the active phase and then at the onset of the transitional phase of labour. The control group received the routine care of the delivery room. The results indicated that the two groups were significantly different in terms of second stage labour duration (Kheirkhah, Valipour, Neisani, & Haghani, 2013). In a study intended to examine the effect of inhalation aromatherapy with rose essential oil on the anxiety of patients undergoing CABG surgery, 66 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) took part in a single-blind randomized clinical trial. The experimental group inhaled three drops of 4% rose essential oil for 10 minutes one night and one hour before surgery. The control group did not receive any intervention. Results indicated that that inhalation aromatherapy with rose essential oil could not significantly reduce anxiety in CABG patients. Further research with larger sample sizes and using different concentrations of rose essential oil was recommended to achieve more definitive conclusions (Fazlollahpour-Rokni, Seyed Afshin, Nouraddin, Rahman, & Raveanbakhsh, 2019). Another study looked at the effects of rose oil on human autonomic parameters and emotional responses in healthy subjects after transdermal absorption. This study found that Rose oil, compared to the placebo, caused significant decreases of breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure, indicating a decrease of autonomic arousal. At the emotional level, participants in the rose oil group rated themselves as more calm, more relaxed and less alert than subjects in the control group. These findings support the relaxing effects of rose oil and provide some evidence for the use of rose oil in aromatherapy for relieving stress and depression (Hongratanaworakit T, 2009). In another study exploring the physiological and subjective effects of daily exposure of olfactory stimulation with rose or orange oil on prefrontal cortex activity, 20 female university students P were exposed to 90 seconds to air impregnated with either rose or orange essential oil. The control group wore the same device but inhaled only unimpregnated air. Results indicated that olfactory stimulation by rose or orange oil induced: (1) a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration in the right prefrontal cortex and (2) an increase in \"comfortable,\" \"relaxed,\" and \"natural\" feelings. The researchers concluded that olfactory stimulation by rose or orange oil induces physiological and psychological relaxation (Lgarashi, Ikei, Song, & Miyazaki, 2014).
