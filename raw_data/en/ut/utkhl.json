The survey was conducted in April by Stewart's Natural Health Advisory Service in the UK. Of those who responded, 673 women were in the midst of the menopause. Two-thirds of these women believed it was putting a strain on their relationship with their partner. Nearly 60 per cent reported a loss of sex drive, while 36 per cent said that intercourse had become painful. \"I knew pretty much that we would get those results because I see it all the time,\" Stewart says. \"It's a comfort to those who are going through it to know that: a) they're not suffering alone; and b) there's a solution. Because it's devastating. I get patients who come in and say, 'I can't feel anything below the waist. I can't have a relationship with my husband; my husband actually thinks I don't love him any more.' \" Stewart, who was in Australia recently to promote her latest book Beat Menopause Naturally, says that while this survey highlights the problems many women experience during the menopause, it's important to be aware that it is \"just a life stage\", and that women can receive education which will help them through it. When they are through it, she says, \"they get their libido back - which is lovely - and their vagina becomes lubricated again. They can have normal relations again, which is so important, because this is such a great time of your life if you're feeling well.\" Although she has spent years at the forefront of menopause management programs in the UK, Stewart's transformation into a sought-after expert was quite accidental. She qualified in preventive dentistry and nutrition, and was on maternity leave from two jobs as a dental hygienist and counsellor when a simple project turned her life on its head. Her husband, a medical practitioner and homeopath, decided to set up the British Society for Nutritional Medicine with his colleagues. They wanted to educate doctors about drug-free, scientifically based approaches to different medical conditions, and needed to have 10,000 medical papers sorted into their respective ailments. Stewart took on the job, and was surprised to find 200 papers on pre-menstrual syndrome. She created a non-drug PMS program for her husband as an add-on to his practice, but then a journalist patient heard about it and wrote a story for the local paper. \"That story got picked up by a health magazine, then Cosmopolitan, then the News of the World, and then I was invited onto breakfast television - all in the space of about two months. And we started getting 700 to 800 letters a day . . . all about the non-drug approach to PMS,\" Stewart says. Before long, the PMT Advisory Service was born, which gradually morphed into a nutritional advisory service for women and then into the NHAS. \"It's all the same thing, really,\" Stewart says. \"It's just as time went on and we did more and more audits, we realised that we weren't just helping people over their PMS . . . We found that other things [were disappearing] like irritable bowel, fatigue, skin problems, headaches, all sorts of things. And people were losing weight without dieting.\" Combining her husband's work with her own, Stewart began to measure patients' nutrient levels to try and unearth the effect their diet was having on their health. The NHAS published three separate studies in which 50 to 80 per cent of the women surveyed had low stores of magnesium, and were also short of other nutrients such as B group vitamins, essential fatty acids, iron, zinc and calcium. However, when these nutrient levels were corrected, Stewart says, it had a \"normalising effect of hormone levels and hormone function ... and symptoms just disappeared\". She therefore regards it as crucial that all people are educated about the kinds of nutrients their body requires for good health. \"I know for certain that more than half the casualties we see in our clinics are due to the fact that people are lacking in education, because as soon as they get the knowledge and learn to meet their body's needs, their symptoms just disappear,\" she says. For the 75 per cent of women who experience unpleasant symptoms associated with the menopause (everything from hot flushes to weight gain and depression), this doesn't mean the only natural solution is an onerous diet. What it does mean is a few changes to bump up the level of isoflavones they eat to between 50 and 100 milligrams a day - the natural level for Japanese people eating foods such as miso and tofu. Yet Stewart says it's \"unrealistic\" to expect people used to Western food to suddenly turn around and adopt an Asian diet. The changes need only be simple: perhaps a soy milk and fruit shake or a muesli made of nuts and seeds for breakfast, a sandwich made with soy and linseed bread for lunch, and quick snacks or isoflavone supplements at other times to keep the levels in their body up around the clock (research shows that \"little and often\" is the most beneficial). \"The compliance rate is much higher these days than it used to be because it is so much easier and the foods are so much more widely available,\" Stewart says.
