AAMTA President's letterAdam Blanning, MD, President, for the AAMTAboard Anthroposophy is not a household term. In fact,very often, whether or not people can correctlypronounce the word is a rough measure of theirfamiliarity with Rudolf Steiner's work. Of course,learning to correctly pronounce \"anthroposophic\"is only the beginning of a much bigger learningprocess that involves becoming familiar with thelanguage of spiritual science as described bySteiner. One step might be to provide the persona dictionary of terms, like \"astral\" and\"consciousness soul,\" but that won't entirelysolve this issue either. Because when you areusing a language of processes and beings thelearning is not just about a vocabulary. It is alsoabout how we can strengthen and stretch our thinking life into a new way of considering the humanbeing and the world. Steiner's deed to work so earnestly on creating a language of the spirit stands asone of the great strengths of anthroposophy. With it, we can recognize and describe so many importantthings! However, it also creates a chasm if we are not conscientious about the ways we use language.Sometimes this is less of an issue. If you speak to a Waldorf parent, it is relatively easy to explain thatanthroposophic medicine and therapies work with the same ideas that stand behind Waldorf education,and incorporate herbal and homeopathic medicines, movement, and massage as healing tools. Whensomeone already has experience of what an anthroposophic activity brings (like Waldorf, Biodynamics,or Camphill communities) then, even with relatively vague terms, it is possible to build a bridge fairlysimply. This is usually because the person brings an existing experience of the spiritual validity ofanthroposophic work and that experience of truth builds trust. When that experiential connectionalready exists, communication is easier. We often build connections with people not connected to the anthroposophic movement, who areseeking something that is \"natural\" or \"holistic.\" They are very happy to encounter an alternative towhat is brought through standard Western medical approaches. There, again, language may not be soimportant. Instead, value is placed on aligned values and philosophy. A special few, those who want todig deeper, encounter the literature of anthroposophy, and in encountering it some will nd their life'swork, while others may turn away to nd something more accessible.At a recent meeting of medical and therapeutic associations joining in the founding of the Academy ofHealth and Integrative Medicine (www.aihm.org), it became clear that those two ways of sharing whatwe do are good, but not truly adequate. They are convenient but we need more means for outreach.The meeting gathered nearly seventy representatives from integrative medicine, naturopathy,homeopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, Chinese medicine, healing touch, holistic nursing, and otherdisciplines. When people asked, \"So what is anthroposophic medicine?\" there was no experientialfamiliarity to build on, and it became quickly clear that using words like \"natural\" and holistic,\" or evenwords like \"spiritual\" or \"working with the whole person,\" were essentially meaningless, becauseeveryone there considers what they are doing to be natural, holistic, spiritual, and working with thewhole person. Developing language that is truthful, but not exclusive, has become a focus this year forthe AAMTA board.That association's meeting was held in San Diego in October but the question of language andoutreach had already been percolating in our minds as an essential element for further growth. We areworking on it now. What can we offer as a one line, descriptive introduction for each of the therapies?What do we say when we are able to share a paragraph? Where do you refer people for an article, or aseries of articles? We are working to consciously build stepping stones from the open question of \"Whatdo you do?\" to the place where people are interested enough that they want to know \"Now, what is theastral body?\"If you have a resource, or would like to share an experience that could be important in how we createthis bridging work, please send it to adamblanning@hotmail.com. We hope to share and practice usingthis kind of bridging language in the year to come.Best wishes for health, growth, and good communication in 2015! Editor's NoteElizabeth Sustick, Vice President of AAMTADear Readers,Please welcome Issue Seven of the annualAAMTA Newsletter. It is rewarding to witnesshow, with every passing year, the interest andparticipation in the AAMTA grows, and thereforethe diversity of activity, as evidenced in thesereports.A theme is reflected in these newslettercontributions: how do we reach out to thebroader world of integrative therapeutics? Howdo we build relationships with those outside ourimmediate circles? These are questions AAMTAis active in pursuing and we welcome yourparticipation in that dialogue. Letters to the editor may be sent to esustick@aamta.org.May our common efforts to honor the human spirit shine brightly in the coming year and bring ustogether in rewarding encounters and initiatives of renewal.Thank you. PAAM And Outreach Peter Hinderberger, MD, President PAAMOutreach is essential for an organization to growand prosper. There are many reasons foroutreach: to realize the mission of theorganization, to partner with like-mindedorganizations or people, for fundraising, to linkwith the community, media, to share resources,etc.Outreach requires, on the one side, for theorganization to be clear about its identity,mission, and foremost about the purpose of itsoutreach and, on the other side, to know thepeople or organizations one reaches out to andto respond with commitment, attention, andappreciation.Historically, PAAM has done outreach mainly within the anthroposophic community: patients, WaldorfSchools, Lilipoh, Renewal, and anthroposophic foundations. This has been achieved by public talks,brochures, advertisement, or letters. Furthermore, PAAM maintains two websites:http://paam.net/home.html and http://www.anthromed.org/.PAAM is also \"out there\" through the websites of AAMTA, the International Federation ofAnthroposophic Medical Associations, and, of course, the Medical Section at the Goetheanum.Recently, a unique opportunity has arisen that will connect anthroposophic medicine with thecomplementary and alternative medical (CAM) community in the United States. Last month, theAcademy of Integrative Health and Medicine (AIHM) had its rst meeting, in San Diego. AIHM is aglobal, multidisciplinary umbrella organization for CAM organizations, individual CAM practitioners, aswell as CAM consumers. For more information, visit http://aihm.org/. Prominent and seasonedrepresentatives of the CAM community are board members. One of them is David Riley, MD, who isfamiliar with anthroposophic medicine. He personally invited PAAM to actively participate in shapingthis organization. We are excited about this development and look forward to be part of the biggercommunity of CAM. Introducing Newcomers to Anthroposophic Medicine:International Postgraduate Medical Training (IPMT) Alicia Landman-Reiner, MD, PAAM Training Director The IPMT, the centerpiece of our anthroposophic medical training, is now in its eighth year in the UnitedStates. The IPMT is also held around the world: in South America (Argentina, Chile, Colombia), theAsia-Pacic (Japan, China, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Australia), Europe, and South Africa. Its veintensive training weeks are held one week at a time, annually. Might not sound like a lot but we call onparticipants to be very active, from early morning until night.What works? Here in the US, we hold three trainings concurrently: doctors, nurses, and rhythmicalmassage therapists. This works because each training devotes most of the day to its own professionalwork. Each profession needs enough time to develop specic expertise.But community amongst health professionals is essential for good anthroposophic medicine. Thepatient, the healing effect, depends on it. The healing spirits gain presence. So the IPMT group of onehundred does morning eurythmy movement, and gathers again each evening to consider innerdevelopment and the universal image of the human being. We share meals and breaks. These times,and good nourishing food, are important.What is essential today for an anthroposophic health professional training? Look around: the worldaround us has become much more open to a holistic viewpoint. Meditation is discussed in academicand popular journals. The NIH's Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine budgets over fourhundred million dollars a year. Twenty American medical schools train doctors in Integrative Medicine, aterm coming to replace \"holistic,\" wonderful because \"integrative\" means standard accredited healingprofessions made better by a body-soul-spirit perspective. That's anthroposophic medicine!Nevertheless our work is not well known. A key issue facing our trainings today is: can we expressourselves to this wider circle of open, spiritually aware colleagues? Can our language, ouranthroposophy, mean something to them?We need to pursue questions of knowledge. We need, as doctors, to know our remedies! Astherapeutic eurythmists, to know and expertly do the gestures! There is a deeper step of making itthoroughly our own, and then a courageous step of speaking from there. It's in the direction of the spiritself, individualizing spirit. It's a forging, and at the same time a vulnerable position.Contact Alicia at areiner@cns.umass.edu. On the last night of IPMTAmanda Templeton, MDOn the last night of IPMT last year, Albert Schmidli, the pharmacist and alchemist we love so well, gavea lecture about the remedy Vulnodoron, or Cinis Capsellae comp. I'd like to share the impact that thislecture had on me. Please forgive any inaccuracies regarding anthroposophic pharmacy.When Albert speaks, there's a sense of excitement, as if he is just about to experience a remarkableevent or be on the verge of a new understanding in the next moment. This night, after the closing of the hall doors, he began the story of a prescription written by Rudolph Steiner's hand, a doron. It is myunderstanding that this original prescription is kept carefully at a pharmacy in Europe, a bit of paperwith some lines of notes kept with others like it. Albert described how this doron had been prepared bythe pharmacy decades ago but had fallen out of clinical use because it had not been found to be veryeffective. Then, Albert told how, as he reviewed the original prescription, he came upon the realizationthat a verb had been misunderstood by the original pharmacists who prepared the remedy. The remedyhad been prepared incorrectly. Albert prepared the remedy again, keeping to his new understanding ofthe correct steps.As he was speaking, I felt increasingly moved in a way that reminded me of being a medical studentand realizing that we physicians, among others, have very good ways of actually helping people. Iremember feeling a unique emotion: a mixture of pride and humility and mostly hope, in realizing that Iwas being taught something useful that, done well and done correctly, could possibly alleviate anotherhuman being's suffering. Over the years, I had nearly forgotten this particular emotion. During thislecture, I was overcome again by it.Albert went on to describe the indications for this remedy, including wound healing. Then, he describedpsychological wound healing as an indication for this remedy. He said this remedy had been helpful foran autistic boy who scratched his face compulsively in front of a mirror. Albert noted that this remedyasks the question, \"Do I want to incarnate?\"I don't pretend to understand the complete implications of this question, however, in my clinical practiceof psychiatry I have looked into the faces of many patients who seem to be asking if they want to bepresent in their lives following severe wounding. In the lecture hall, I experienced the odd mixture ofhope, pride, and humility again. I was overcome by the possibility of assisting our patients as they mightapproach this question. Tears came and I became a bit embarrassed to be in a lecture hall ofprofessionals without a tissue. My mentor happened to be sitting beside me and she reached into herbag to pull out a Tupperware container holding the bones of a small animal. These bones werewrapped in tissue to protect it from the next day's travel. Thoughtfully, she offered me this one tissueavailable to us, and dutifully whispered the contents of her container so that I could decide if I wanted touse a tissue that had been used to wrap around bones. I gratefully accepted this tissue. Somehow, thisexchange made me laugh at how sweet and absurd our experiences can be. And then as Albertcompleted his lecture, I felt grateful that I might be a part of the kind of medicine that could provide thisremedy. A Biodynamic Therapeutic Alliance Melissa Greer, D.O.In medical school, I learned very little about the role of nutrition in health. Much of what I did learn inconventional nutrition teachings I have found has little actual meaning in wellness. No one ever spokein medical school about the role of the farmer in health or illness. As a medical student, I was taught ofthe helping role of the physical therapist, the nurse, the masseuse, and the diabetes educator but nomention was made of the local farmer.Yet the role of the farmer is an extraordinarily influential one on local community health. Farmers havethe potential to be our frontline of wellbeing. As a physician, my daily work focuses on the health ofindividuals. The farmer can, through biodynamics, act as a therapist for the collective human body ofthe community. We speak much, in fact, about the karma of the physician in his/her therapeutic work.What of the karma of the farmer? Certainly each local farmer reaches more people each year throughhis/her work on the earth, which benets or harms the soil and water table, and provides an example ofworldview in his/her relationship to the earth. This is the same for all farmers whether conventional,organic, or biodynamic. However, not all work therapeutically. What wonder it would be if they did. This November, a group of interested people met in Louisville at the Biodynamics AssociationConference to look more closely at this relationship between healthcare and agriculture. PAAM boardmembers, Steven Johnson, D.O. and David Gershan, M.D., along with Matias Baker, biodynamicsconsultant, and Robert Karp, Executive Director of the Biodynamics Association, organized apreconference workshop, \"Bridging Biodynamic Agriculture and Anthroposophic Medicine.\" Thepurpose of this meeting was to bring awareness to this health partnership as well as to consider how tomove forward in local initiatives. A few themes discussed were:1. Awareness of partnership: The need to recognize who our therapeutic partners are in ourcommunities. The question was asked: if you work with your hands in the soil, who are yournearby partners in healthcare working in your community? If you are working in healthcare, whoare the individuals working with the land in your community?2. Study: Start conversations with these partners and establish regular studies on what thisagrarian healthcare implies for our communities. It is recognized that sustaining initiatives inSpiritual Science need a foundation of study from which creative new impulses can spring.3. Education: Consider the needs of each community and look for what initiatives can arise:education in the form of public talks/discussions, high school outreach, art exhibits, newtherapeutic approaches.4. Economic considerations: Be open to discussions on our economic health. Consider also thelong-term earth benets of land trusts and their future role in biodynamic agriculture.5. Networking: Keep in touch with one another for encouragement, inspiration, and sharinginitiative progress. A discussion space for this initiative is currently under construction on theBDA website.With conscious intent, we are beginning to form a wellness alliance. Now this word \"alliance\" mayconjure up images of formal agreements between nations in a time of war. Maybe that, in some sense,could apply to our work as well. But more than this, alliance means union, a relationship in workingtogether, an active coming together in service to the world. We might do well just to go about our ownwork independently while touching the lives of those who come to us. However, we now recognize thatwe can locally co-create much more with a unied light.I'd like to propose that AAMTA fully recognize the work of biodynamic farmers therapeutically inanthroposophic wellness and healthcare. I'd like to suggest that each reader of this article take closeconsideration of the above and listen to whether it lights your heart and will. With this light, may wework together with the natural world to aid in building the spiritual body of man and earth.1 Corinthians 15: 46-49 While the ofcial discussion site for this initiative is under construction, please send your name andemail to our mailing list for further information: bridging.medicine.agriculture@gmail.com. Farming for HealthStephen Johnson, DOIn mid-November, over four hundred participants gathered in Louisville, Kentucky for the Farming forHealth conference, sponsored by the Biodynamic Association of North America. A group of sixtyfarmers, physicians, and therapists attended a half-day pre-conference attempting to bridgeanthroposophic healthcare and biodynamic farming and nutrition. The idea for this pre-conference grewout of conversations between David Karp (director of the BDA), Dr. David Gershan, Melissa Greer,myself, and many others. Dennis Klocek and myself gave keynote presentations on the topic of cosmicnutrition and salutogenic principals of health and several breakout groups were led by differentclinicians and farmers on topics related to these themes.These topics, as well as the general conference theme, were very well received and the number ofparticipants and intense conversations suggests that this collaboration has great potential for the future,if some individuals step forward to continue this impulse.David Gershan, M.D has initiated a blog to facilitate communication and conversation on this initiative.All are encouraged to join in the conversation. There was hope that the PAAM and AMTA would try tobridge what was started at the biodynamic conference in their upcoming conferences. A few weekslater, I presented and attended a local farm and economy conference at Vanderbilt University. There, aswell, hundreds of people gathered, from all walks of life, who believe that these kinds of local initiativesare key to the future of public health, policy, and social renewal in the future. Biodynamics is very much in the middle of the local farm and local economy movement, which is rapidlybecoming a forum for topics of public health, nutrition, and socioeconomic justice. A larger vision for thiscooperation would be that we cultivate in our work a practical working vision of hygienic occultism, asdiscussed by Rudolf Steiner, and contribute to a modern paradigm of health ecology.It is becoming increasingly clear in modern consciousness that the health of human beings, theenvironment, our communities, and all life are linked together. In the future, public health needs tobecome a discussion between farmers, gardeners, clinicians, teachers, businesspersons, policymakers, and all professions willing to sit at the table and coordinate our activities for the greater good ofall. I am hopeful that Anthroposophic medicine can take a leadership role in cultivating a modern concept of health ecology and participate is this emerging community movement with our Biodynamic,Waldorf, and other interested anthroposophic colleagues, as well as the many sincere human beingsstriving for the greater good in our communities. AnthroHealth: Looking Ahead in the Light of EFPAM's MeetingMichele SanzDuring the September International MedicalSection conference, I was invited to representAnthroHealth (AH) at the annual meeting of theEuropean Federation of Patients' Associationsfor Anthroposophic Medicine (EFPAM), inArlesheim.As much as there is denitely increased interestin Integrative Medicine in Europe as well as inthe U.S., it was humbling to be reminded thatanthroposophic medicine (AM) is still one of thebest-kept secrets in that eld! Although AM iscertainly better known and established in Europethan in other parts of the world, the fewrepresentatives of EFPAM member associationscomplained about the difculty of recruiting newmembers, particularly in a climate where youngerpeople don't like to join an association. Parallel tothis recent development, current members'loyalty to their association is decreasing. Steps,such as some of those mentioned below, werediscussed in that context:Find a niche positioning for AM that speaks to a broader range of supporters, e.g. healthylifestyle practices, after-care, or support and empowerment of patients and their family.Strive for recognition of AM as a system, along the lines of what the well-known Chinese orAyurvedic medicines have successfully done.Promote awareness in 2015 and beyond of \"4 A's Policy\" (Access, Applicability, Availability,Affordability), now recognized by EUROCAM.On the home front: AH, although still in the early stages of consolidating itself as an association, wasable to start doing some outreach this year and to successfully raise enough funds, thanks to thegenerosity of the anthroposophic medical community at large, to prepare a brochure and thebeginnings of a webpage. So far, the brochure was distributed at the PAAM-IPMT conference andsubsequently emailed to the participants, as well as via the AAMTA E-News. A recent mention of thisinitiative in the fall issue of Lilipoh has generated a few inquiries but, for various personal reasons,progress has been slower than anticipated. The hope for 2015 is to develop a page within AAMTA'swebsite.Anyone with ideas and skills to help with this project is invited to contact AH atcontact@anthrohealth.org. Thank you! Lili Kolisko MDDear Friends,Here are some examples of our activities in2014.Research We are continuing our study on theeffect of potentized substances on the life forcesof growing wheat seeds. This is a test that LilyKolisko and R. Steiner initially designed and weexpanded on. In the graph, you can see theinfluence of Plumbum (lead) on the growth forces. Note that even when lead is potentized nineteentimes over (diluted 1:10, nineteen times) so that almost no molecule of the toxic substance is left, thelead still has an inhibiting effect on the growth of the seedlings. (See how the chart lines point down, i.e.the growth is less than the control, the rst value). Then, surprisingly enough, at even higher dilutions -when truly not a single molecule of the lead is present anymore - the influence on the growth is nowstimulating! This kind of research helps to make better anthroposophic medicines and helps thephysician determine which potency is best suited for a particular patient.We are concentrating now on analyzing the relationship between star constellations and variouslypotentized substances.We are expanding our research into processes that R. Steiner gave a high importance to, such as theobtaining of mineral substances from ashing herbal material and including these salts, minerals, andashes into nished medicinal formulas. You can see in the photo what the ashes of horsetail (equisetumarvense) look like. Finding the correct temperature for \"ashing\" of individual plants and determining theoptimal length of time that the ashing should continue requires repeated experiments. Educational Activities This last year, we have visited many communities highlighting not onlyanthroposophic medicine but also emphasizing the esoteric basis of this new kind of medicine as wellas practicing eurythmy, both therapeutic eurythmy and eurythmy as an impulse to harmonize oneselfwith the ongoing impulses coming out of the spiritual world. We went to:Boston, MAKimberton, PANashville, TEHartland, WIViroqua, WIContributed to the IPMT in CaliforniaSome of the topics covered were the too tired or too wired child, remedies for chronic illnesses, andmore. Please let us know if you would like us to visit your community.At the last conference, given November 9, 2014 in Hartland, WI, we discussed the gems stones in R.Steiner's work, clinical applications for anthroposophic medicines, etc. We were especially happy to bejoined by excellent artists. In the coming year, we will give a complete new series of webinars on various medical topics. Pleasejoin us!If you would like to support our work, please visit our newly redesigned website athttp://www.koliskoinstitute.org. Sophia Micha-el RemediesKelly Sutton, MD How do we reach out to the broader world ofintegrative therapeutics?How do we build relationships with those outsideour immediate circles?I wear two hats in answering this call for ideas.One, as an AM provider who would like to seeher practice go forward with a younger physicianpartner (MD/DO/ND), and the other, as anorganizer of Sophia Micha-el Remedies, thewebsite offering free public education on anthroposophic healthcare (http://sophiamicha-elremedies.com/). As I answer my personal questions seeking broader relationships, I am also buildingconnections beyond just myself, to the broader world of AM.As a provider in a specic place (Fair Oaks, CA), I hope to work with a holistic MD friend and create atea for holistic providers in our area to meet one another, learn what the range of practices is in ourarea, and see if there is a foundation for a future study group. At least socially, I hope we can cometogether once a year. I hope we can have our tea early in 2015, so providers can sign up for IPMT 2015if they are interested. I will also join LinkedIn and be open about what I do in my practice, invitingcomments and questions.As an organizer for Sophia Micha-el Remedies (SMR), it is clear that the effort is only a year old, andstill small. Its rst task is to become better known and be of service to the Waldorf-Anthroposophiccommunity.Beyond that, it is clear that the unique insights of Rudolf Steiner have relevance to the difcultquestions of our time (e.g. Ebola) and we will plan an advertising campaign to holistic sites and groups.Because the website is public, there is careful discussion of language around use of words such as'spiritual' or 'Christ impulse.' At this point, we have considered that the plant can be a demonstration of cosmic forces at work.The SMR website is free to speak on political topics and has supported a Physicians' Statement ofConcern calling on the FDA to respond to a 2011 citizens' petition to safety test and label GMO foods(petitions are supposed to have a response in 180 day.The SMR editorial board has created an editorial calendar for the year, so physicians and therapistscan know what articles are planned in the next twelve months. The calendar is made available by SMR,inviting suggestions for topics, changes in content, clinical pearls, and offering an icon for SMR to beput on websites of anthroposophic organizations and individuals' practices. SMR hopes to offer eventlistings by region, so the AM-related activities of our nation are readily visible to readers.For more information, visit http://sophiamicha-elremedies.com/. Healing the Wound: AAMTA/PAAM Conference in Toronto 2014Veronica Koopmans, M.D.As the sun started warming the snow-covered ground last March, we welcomed the participants to thebiannual AAMTA/PAAM conference in Toronto, which was organized by CAMA. Participants came fromall over North America and it was, after months of preparation, a festive moment when the rst peoplestarted arriving in the atrium of the new Hesperus Building. We were happy to be able to use thebeautiful premises of the Toronto Waldorf School and have the meals in the dining room at Hesperus,which was graciously made available by the residents of Hesperus.\"Healing the Wound\" was the theme, a theme that occupies us every day as therapists and physicians.Dr. Guus van de Bie (a retired family physician from the Netherlands) introduced in his keynote theconcept of supersensible organ of repair, the four stages of the dynamic healing process in relationshipwith the four members of the Human Being and the Organ of Repair, in the light of the Lucifer andAhriman polarity.These themes and how they apply to healing from life's traumas were explored in further keynotelectures and workshops. Charlotte Allmer (a massage therapist and educator from Austria) spoke abouthow to create a space where healing is possible and shared from her great source of knowledge aboutexternal applications. Dr. Peter Gruenewald (a general practitioner in the UK) introduced us to how toheal from stress and taught us many exercises from his work in developing adaptive resilience.Marjolein Schulthess-Roozen (a psychiatrist at the Ita Wegman Clinic in Switzerland) shared her workwith traumatized patients in her practice and made us aware of how important it is to take thedevelopmental age when trauma takes place into consideration. Jef Saunders (a counselor in Toronto)gave a wonderful example about transformation through an artistic process. The last day was lled withan enlightening contribution by Norman Kingeter (a eurythmy therapist at the Ita Wegman Clinic inSwitzerland) on how to support patients through eurythmy and the day was closed off by Dr. KennethMcAlister (a physician in Toronto) on how to work with concepts of light and heaviness, based on thesecond meditation for Physicians. And so much more was explored in all the different workshops. We were nourished by a daily Eurythmy performance by Northern Star Eurythmy, gradually introducingus to the \"Butterfly Form\" of Marjolein Spock, as well as several musical contributions. In the great hall,we were surrounded by the seals of the rst Goetheanum, which created an intimate and supportedenvironment. And last, but not least, much joy was received from the meals of Evelyne Gharabani ofHeart Catering, that were, in the words of participants, \"incredible, wonderful, yummier, excellent, withlovely service!\"It was a true honor to welcome so many participants and I truly hope to meet you all in 2016 in SanFrancisco. AAMTA Biennial Conference 2016Carmen Hering, Tiffany coordinators of the 2016 AAMTAConference The 2016 AAMTA Conference will take place onthe beautiful IONS property of NorthernCalifornia! Rolling hills; live oaks, laurel,eucalyptus; hiking paths; room for solidarity aswell as group reflection; and joy will host us aswe discuss and share in the mysteries ofdigestion and nutrition. The dates are August 3rdthrough 6th, 2016. More will be revealed!Please contact your respective AAMTA groups to plan and develop study for presentations based onthis theme.

This year'sconference gathered about twenty ve people,from a broad range of disciplines, to work withtwo contrasting cases: number one (excessiveastral activity) and number eight (atonic astral).The combined cases really allowed for a broadexamination of the activity of the astral body,both from the side of contracting consciousnessin the sense pole and expansive metabolic activity through the kidney.The opportunity for everyone to both give and receive a ginger kidney compress turned out to be one of the core experiences. What was striking was the way in which people experienced the ginger (some asa cool warmth, some as a very activating warmth). Whether someone was tired and needed to beastrally energized or anxious and needed to be astrally calmed, the kidney support was helpful. One ofthe comments that was shared:\"Offering the kidney compresses to one another was also a special experience of doing/'deeding' if youwill, in addition to the cognitive consideration of the subject matter. Practice in viewing the polarities inthese two cases was helpful in strengthening one's observation skills and in getting more adept in usingthe contrast of polarities as a means to deeper understanding that goes beyond describing thesymptoms of distress.\"This process of approaching a case experientially from many sides has now proven to be a consistentlyrewarding experience, and a lovely way to build fellowship. Next fall will be the tenth annual meetingand feels like it will, in yet unknown ways, mark a new phase in this kind of group work. We lookforward to continuing the work and gaining new friends and colleagues in the process. Can You See Me?Jeanette RodriguezIt is with increasing frequency that children are struggling in the typical Waldorf classroom. Even withthe wide range of learning differences Waldorf teachers are able to manage, the amount of childrenwhose needs cannot be met is at a disturbing high. Many of these children are diagnosed withmainstream diagnoses, such as developmental delays and/or learning disabilities. The despair of thechildren who carry these karmic burdens seems to be directly related to the attempt of society to doaway with the need for human qualities and interaction. Human beings are being replaced bymechanical competence everywhere and education is being threatened by the measurement of testscores as being its sole purpose.These children feel helpless in their ability to engage their body in the process of trying to incarnate.What they know is that no one understands their words, their actions seem always out of place, andthey cannot learn or play like the other children. One could say that they have taken on a huge task -not just to redene education, but to redeem the qualities of the human being that make humanitypossible. They demand that we see them, really see them.The attempt to take on the challenge of meeting these children is the impulse behind the Otto SpechtSchool (OSS). OSS began as a Waldorf-based home school initiative in 2002 and by 2010, through theThreefold Educational Charter and the state of NY, it became a licensed private school.Along with grades 1-12, the OSS recently added an early childhood program, and a post high schooltransitional life skills program. All students are immersed in an adaptive Waldorf curriculum that focuseson and nurtures the development of the child's lower senses, as well as the harmonious relationshipbetween their beings of thinking, feeling, and willing. Classes are very small, with no more than ve students to one teacher - and often even one on one.The school is embedded in the Elder Care Fellowship Community where the students participate indaily meaningful work that relentlessly calls on them to engage their will - planting, weeding, cooking,carving, setting tables, molding clay, gathering eggs, tending cows. Like eurythmy, these activities arecrucial to the completeness of the curriculum and to the success of the student's educationalexperience.At the core of this therapeutic education remains the question, \"Do we see the child?\" If we truly seeand unconditionally accept the being that stands before us, then we can begin the mutual task ofeducation. The task is actually a journey for the salvation of humanity, which above all, cannot be madewithout compassion, integrity, reverence, and love. By connecting as one through the human path ofeducation, we nd the blessed meaning in caring for children in need of soul care. It is the remedy forour time.The Otto Specht School is located in Chestnut Ridge, NY. For more information, contact JeanetteRodriguez at jrodriguez@ottospecht.org or visit www.threefold.org. Reaching Out as Integrative Movement TherapistsDale RobinsonReaching out and forging connections with other therapeutic modalities needs an ability to clearly statewho we are and what we have to offer, as well as a willingness to listen to others and to understandwhat they are offering.For ATHENA, the question \"Who are we?\" is an ongoing issue. Therapeutic eurythmist, following thethreat of a lawsuit back in the 80's that \"curative\" stated a false claim, has replaced the term curativeeurythmist. Presently in the UK and in Germany, eurythmy therapy (eurythmie therapie) is the mostcommonly used term for what we do. This term is gaining more and more popularity on this continentas well. As a subtitle, the phrase integrative movement therapy is also becoming more popular.Perhaps a statement that would have the broadest acceptance among eurythmy colleagues right nowwould be: we are therapeutic eurythmists and we do eurythmy therapy, an integrative movementtherapy.But this still doesn't explain to people what we actually do. To reach out to the broader world ofintegrative therapeutics, we can spare people an explanation of eurythmy, per se, but we clearly haveto explain (better yet, demonstrate or allow people to experience) what we offer and are integrating, sothey can grasp what it is. Our anthroposophical understanding of the human being (and our focus astherapists) gives our work a wide array of applications but not everyone will readily understand all ofthese. So depending on who we are addressing, we might elaborate on one or more of the followingpossibilities (this list is not meant to be limiting):Eurythmy movements integrate the four bodily (or lower) senses: touch, well-being or life, self- movement, and balance. You see this integration clearly in the Dexterity 'E' exercise or with anyof the consonant gestures which in eurythmy therapy are often done with small jumps, landingon the toes for a second or two.Using physiological terms (just looking at the physical body), eurythmy therapy is very effectiveat integrating the tactile system, the autonomic nervous system, the sensory-motor system, andthe vestibular system (which are respectively reflected in the four lower senses, above).We can also concentrate on and integrate the four members of the human being (physical,etheric, astral, and ego) which are, again, reflected or honed in the respective four bodilysenses or systems, above.Eurythmy movements can help integrate the three human soul forces: thinking, feeling, andwilling.We can also look at strengthening and integrating the higher senses elaborated by RudolfSteiner as these are a metamorphosis of, again, the lower senses. Here, together with thetransformation of metabolic forces and the rening of our feeling and thinking nature througheurythmy movements, we open doorways into the more subtle, psychological effects ofeurythmy therapy.We can also further strengthen and integrate into the earthly human being the cosmicarchetypes found in the planets and constellations (in the form of vowels and consonants) North American Anthroposophic Nurses AssociationElizabeth Sustick, Vice President of NAANANANNA is now two years old and working withthe reality that we live in a time where there is notime! We are searching for the tools that willallow us to generate the space and the light forthe pressing issues of continued growth anddevelopment. We want to be active in building upand working in alliances and we recognize thatwork done in relationship with others is the wayof the future. Toward this goal, we are fortunateto have not only AAMTA to partner with, but alsothe wellsprings of connections within theinternational anthroposophic medical communitythrough the Medical Section, and theInternational Forum for Anthroposophic Nursing(IFAN).It was out of these alliances that NANNAdeveloped and is able to continue to offercertied continuing education in RhythmicalEinreibung, Oil Dispersion Bath Therapy, and the Anthroposophic Nursing Foundation Course. Through the collaboration with PAAM at the IPMT startingin 2009, the development of the Foundation Course in Anthroposophic Nursing was made possible. In2015 at the International Postgraduate Medical Training, NAANA will take another step for the futuredevelopment of Anthroposophic Nursing through inaugurating the certied course work for theAnthroposophic Nurse Specialist.NAANA is committed to creating broader alliances. As our heart strength in number grows, more willbecome possible, and the way forward to building alliances with the greater therapeutic community willdevelop.\"For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintendedside effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself...Happiness must happen, andthe same holds true for success: you must let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen towhat your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.Then you will live to see that in the long run- in the long run, I say!- success will follow you preciselybecause you had forgotten to think about it.\"Victor Frankl, The Human Being in the Search for Meaning. RMTA Steps Forward with Therapist TrainingKathy Strutz, Secretary-Treasurer of RMTA AmericaIn the last several years, outreach activities forthe RMTA have been taking place more or lessbehind the scenes. Incorporation as a non-protoccurred in 2013, which paved the way for ourstanding as an organization publicly dedicated topromoting and expanding the presence ofrhythmical massage therapy in health andwellness care. With limited resources, we workedon the creation of a website(www.rhythmicalmassagetherapy.org) whichwould make us visible online, and provideinformation about our activities, the benets and efcacy of rhythmical massage therapy, and newtherapist training. The need for future rhythmical massage therapists engaged us in the tasks ofdeveloping a curriculum, teacher training, student recruitment, and negotiations with Rudolf SteinerCollege to lease teaching space.The new RMTA-sponsored training had a special and fruitful beginning in Fair Oaks in May 2014, withthe participation of eleven highly qualied students from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. InstructorsMargaret Kerndt and Marlies Schade presented an introduction to the massage movements, thearchetypal forms, and the elements through which these forms become manifest. We were fortunate tobe invited by PAAM to begin our work in conjunction with the International Postgraduate MedicalTraining course. This meant that in addition to their introduction to the rhythmical massage therapytraining, our students participated in early morning Eurythmy with ninety ve other doctors, nurses, andtherapists, led by Glenda Monash. Daily lectures with Albert Schmidli challenged them to plunge intothe phenomenology of the salt, sulphur, and mercury realms. In the evenings, Michaela Gloecklerspoke eloquently on the inner development of the therapist. Shared meals and break times encouragedinformal meetings and conversation among this large group of health care professionals working out ofAnthroposophy and gave our students a sense of the potential for rhythmical massage therapy to be anintegral part of a therapeutic community of colleagues. In October and November 2014, a subsequentthree-week session was held at Rudolf Steiner College and we look forward to again joining with the IPMT group in April 2015. We continue to receive inquiries about rhythmical massage therapy from our website and our presenceon the AAMTA site. As we go forward, we would like to have the resources to offer one- or two-dayintroductory workshops so that RMT can be experienced in small group settings and carried intocommunities. We hope to develop a larger working board of directors for RMTA. We would also like tohelp create internship placements for our graduates and nd other ways to *bring RMT into the world. SPANBob KellumSPAN continues to move forward in developingits certication process and website presence.We have had ve new members join us this falland we continue with our outreach programs.Bob Kellum recently spoke to the medicalstudents at NCNM in November, with a veryenthusiastic response, and he has also beenworking with four different student preceptorsinterested in learning about anthroposophic naturopathy. The Anthroposophic Club at NCNM isdeveloping a number of videos, in conjunction with Jannebeth Roell and Paul Kalnins, to providestudents there with information on short accessible topics, including the three-fold and four-fold bodies,the importance of warmth, the use of various topical compresses, etc. We are planning our secondannual conference here in Portland for May of 2015 (David Gershan is planning to join us), and PhilipIncao will be coming to give a talk to NCNM, the local community, and our Waldorf schools, in April.Two of us on the board (Ali Givens and Jennifer Schmitt) have also been deepening connections withWaldorf Schools, with good results. The Anthroposophic Therapeutic Singing Impulse: Beginningsand DevelopmentSandra ZeeseBorn September 22, 1879, in Sweden, ValborgSv\u00e4rdstr\u00f6m had an interest in medicine but wasencouraged to become a singer because of herextraordinary voice. She became a renownedopera star all through Europe. She met andmarried Louis Werbeck, who introduced her in1912 to Rudolf Steiner. When they met, Dr.Steiner said, \"You must sing in the same way Ispeak, with sublimated air.\" Thus began atwelve-year collaborative working relationship. Using the vowels and consonants, the musicalelements of tones, intervals, scales, andmelodies, along with movement and breathing,Valborg Werbeck-Sv\u00e4rdstr\u00f6m created many singing exercises and sequences that couldenliven energies, remove obstacles, and developthe physical, emotional, mental, and spiritualaspects of the human being, and reflect in thevoice. She brought her research to RudolfSteiner. Their collaboration culminated inJanuary 1924 when, having worked with her onthe singing exercises she was developing andgoing through her book, Uncovering the Voice:Catharsis through Singing, line by line, RudolfSteiner authorized her to call her singing schoolan Anthroposophic Singing School.After Dr. Steiner's passing in 1925, shecontinued working artistically and also workingtherapeutically in collaboration with Dr. ItaWegman, and in colleagueship with Dr. EugenKolisko and Dr. Karl K\u00f6nig.At the end of World War II, at sixty-six years old, she traveled to Eckw\u00e4lden, near Stuttgart. There,where the Anthroposophic, curative education impulse had survived, she worked with singing astherapy for special needs children and adults. Other leading anthroposophists also came to Eckw\u00e4lden,including Dr. Hauschka.In her last ve years, she passed her knowledge of anthroposphically-based singing therapy tocomposer, J\u00fcrgen Schriefer. They worked intensively and she imparted the depth and breadth of thetherapeutic singing impulse begun by her and Dr. Steiner until February 1, 1972, when she crossed thethreshold.J\u00fcrgen Schriefer carried on her work, traveling around the world, including many trips to Rudolf SteinerCollege. He taught many students, imparting an artistic path of development and specicallytherapeutic exercises.His compositions for Dr. Steiner's meditations on the twelve signs of the Zodiac and other verses,music for works by Goethe, Novalis, and other inspired pieces were performed in the ChartresCathedral and at the Goetheanum in several unforgettable concerts.Thomas Adam became his student in 1975, and, with his guidance, worked therapeutically in Bochumfor over two decades. In 1998, Mr. Adam was invited to come to America to give a training course inanthroposophic therapeutic singing. In 2004, fteen students graduated from this course, for which Dr.Stephen Johnson gave medical modules, with approval by Dr. Karnow for the Medical Section of NorthAmerica.That summer, a second course began on the west coast. Dr. Incao had taken a workshop ontherapeutic singing at the 2003 Artemisia Conference and enthusiastically worked with the medicalteaching for the second course. Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler attended the nal graduating session of that course inFebruary 2008, near Sacramento.Thomas Adam has worked closely with the Anthroposophic Art Therapy group at the Goetheanum inDornach. In January 2014, formation courses in anthroposophic therapeutic singing were certied bythe medical section in Dornach.In 2013, graduates from the American courses formed the Anthroposophic Therapeutic SingingAssociation of North America (ATSANA) and joined AAMTA in Toronto in March 2014.

Inner Fire, Inc.Beatrice BirchEvery week, I receive inquiries from desperateparents, individuals in crisis, and disheartenedprofessionals, all demoralized by the medication-based mental health system, which emphasizesshort-term relief through the suppression ofsymptoms but fosters long-term dependency ondrugs and their attendant disabling side-effects.They are searching for exactly what Inner Firewill be: a proactive, healing community offering people struggling with debilitating and traumatic life challenges a path of recovery without the use ofpsychotropic medication.\"I have all these feelings inside me and I cannot reach them. I used to be able to think clearly but can'tnow. It is as if the meds are pushing who I really am under the table.\" These are words a young manexpressed during one of our sessions together. He articulates a fundamental truth for so manystruggling individuals.The key word here is choice. For some, psychotropic medications can be benecial but for all too manythey result in permanent disability; social isolation; unemployment; loss of personality, initiative,creativity; and worse. I know far too many young individuals who have committed suicide, discouragedby the prospect of living the rest of their life under the dehumanizing fog of medication.In the spring, we intend to start building a home for twelve where, honoring the whole human being ofbody, soul, and spirit, individuals can slowly ease off their medications, or avoid them all together, whilebeing supported by Inner Fire's psychiatrist and detox program which include proactive therapies andmeaningful work.As Dr. Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist, who for over fty years never medicated and never had a suicide,stated: \"You think we understand the brain? It is more complicated than the universe... Once you startmedicating you are no longer interested in the individual's story.\"From my thirty years of experience working in Anthroposophical medical and therapeutic practices inEngland, Holland, and the USA, I have witnessed the profound soul-spiritual growth of strivingindividuals through their engagement in the therapies whose foundations stem from AnthroposophiaThe success of Inner Fire is dependent on a community of experienced and pioneering therapists andguides who are committed to supporting individual choice and believe in the creator within each of usWe are looking for:Therapeutically: A therapeutic eurythmist, spatial dynamic practitioner, music therapist,rhythmical massage therapist, biographical counselor, and a registered, anthroposophicallytrained nurse.

Their departments and servicescomplement each other very well. A new service,oncologic rehabilitation will also be developed.It is a historic event. After more than ninetyyears, Ita Wegman Klinik, the rst and mosthistoric anthroposophic hospital in the world, and Lukas Klinik, a 1963 spin-off that was founded byAlexandre and Rita Leroi and Werner Kaelin with a special focus on oncology, were merged by theirsponsoring organizations. The Ita Wegman Klinik was founded in 1921 by Ita Wegman as Clinical-Therapeutical Institute, a name given by Rudolf Steiner. The common name of the clinic was ClinicArlesheim. So, with its new name, the Klinik Arlesheim connects to he history of the beginning decades,before the clinics split. In this sense, something grew together that belonged together and now isdedicated to a new, strong future.Moreover, the Klinik Arlesheim is the rst and biggest hospital for complementary medicine inSwitzerland. It unites all services of both merged partners, such as cardiology, pulmonology , neurology,as well as psychiatry and psychsomatic services, including 24-hour emergency services and anintense and broadly operating ambulant clinic. The center for anthroposophic oncology and supportivecare is a center of internationally known excellence and will be completed by a newly openeddepartment for oncologic rehabilitation. All services are ofcially acknowledged by the health authoritiesand are eligible for reimbursement through insurance and the public health system.The new hospital has eighty-four beds for in-patients, plus twenty beds in a day clinic for cancerpatients. The staff counts four hundred fty employees.It is a goal of those responsible to unite skills and forces in order to strengthen the home place ofanthroposophic medicine so it can grow und flourish to provide high quality, comprehensive medicalcare to patients from near and far.For further information, see www.klinik-arlesheim.ch Individual Paediatrics, by Georg Soldner MD, A ReviewA review by Alicia Landman, MDA new AM pediatric text has just come out in English: Individual Paediatrics, by GeorgSoldner MD Click here for flyerI highly recommend it to AM healthprofessionals, Waldorf schools and programs,and remedial teachers. It's 900+ pages onpediatric medical and behavioral conditions.Dr. Soldner discusses the prenatal periodincluding the soul-spiritual nature of the child,premature babies, and breastfeeding. Heincludes preventive issues such as vitamin D andsun exposure, fluoride, vaccination; Hediscusses a great variety of children's illnessesincluding fever care, allergy, asthma, Lymedisease, congenital heart disease, GI illnessesacute and chronic, respiratory infections, UTI's,rheumatoid illnesses. He also discussesbehavioral, developmental and learning-related topics such as sleep, anxiety, depression,ADHD/ADD, stuttering and speech delay, ticsand nailbiting, bedwetting, and problems with sight and hearing. While the level of discourse and ultimately thefocus is geared for doctors, I think there is muchof great interest to other health professionals and to educators. It can support Waldorf School facultymembers in their dialog with parents regarding child health issues, from a highly experienced pediatricperspective.Georg Soldner MD, the author, is a longtime anthroposophic medical doctor (pediatrician) and teacherof AM, in Germany, currently head of the German AM doctors' association. Dr. Soldner is also a warmand caring person you immediately want for your children's or grandchildren's doctor. He wrote the rstedition of this comprehensive pediatric text in 2001 with his colleague Michael Stellmann MD, nowdeceased. Dr. Soldner has since revised it; his popular work is now in its fourth edition in Germany.David Martin MD, chief translator, is a pediatrician and professor of medicine in Germany, fluent inEnglish, and thoroughly conversant with anthroposophic medicine. We are fortunate indeed to have hismedical and anthroposophic expertise guiding this rst-ever English translation. Representatives of the anthroposophic medical movement globally requested translation of this invaluable textbook, three years ago. Doctors' associations from the US, Canada, UK, New Zealand,and Sweden generously contributed and the Mahle Stiftung (Foundation) substantially supported theproject of translation. PAAM members in the US generously contributed additional funds as well asediting, seeing the project through to completion. Rudolf Steiner Library in NY helped with thebibliography. We at PAAM are very happy and proud to see the result of this all this work andgenerosity now available in print.The best possible thanks to Dr. Soldner for sharing his knowledge, experience and devotion would beto use the book as a consultative resource both for the treatment of children and the support ofparents\" as he hopes. He suggests that it is of great import \"...whether one approaches paediatricmedicine in purely technological terms...or whether children are encouraged to actively overcome their health crises through providing them with sustained support in their capacity for self-regulation. The latter approach, combined with accompanying paediatric expertise, enables the childand parents to experience that they themselves can contribute to achieving the condition ofhealth...their skills are strengthened and their trust in -- and familiarity with -- their own capacity toovercome crises is enhanced.\" You have received this email because you have subscribed to AAMTA assome@example.com.
