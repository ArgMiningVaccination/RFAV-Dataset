The NIS is an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) instrument administered to inmates in correctional facilities to measure the prevalence of sex ual assault at the facility level. BJS anticipates making one award for a 24-month period under this solicitation. This survey is part of the National Prison Rape Statis tics program (NPRS), a recurring survey series which will collect and analyze data on the prevalence of sexual assault among individuals held in federal and state prisons, local jails, and juvenile facilities as well as former inmates. The data collections under NPRS are in response to the mandate to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) under The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA). BJS, the statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Justice, is statutorily authorized to collect, compile, analyze, publish, and disseminate uniform national statistics concerning all aspects of criminal justice and related components of the justice system. BJS is responsible for collecting data for the NPRS. Findings from the NPRS will be used to develop and implement national standards for the detection, prevention, and reduction of sexual assault within correctional facilities. BJS is authorized to issue this solicitation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3732(c) and 15603(a). Deadline: Registration Registering with Grants.gov is a one-time process; how ever, if you are a first time registrant it could take up to several weeks to have your registration validated and confirmed and to receive your user password.

Deadline: Application The due date for applying for funding under this announcement is May 29, 2008, 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. Eligibility Both for-profit (commercial) and non-profit organiza tions may apply for funds. However, consistent with OJP fiscal requirements, for-profit organizations are not allowed to make a profit as a result of this award or to charge a management fee for the performance of this award. 4 Faith-Based and Other Community Organizations: Consistent with President George W. Bush's Executive Order 13279, dated December 12, 2002, and 28 C.F.R. Part 38, it is DOJ policy that faith-based and other community organizations that statutorily qualify as eligible applicants under DOJ programs are invited and encouraged to apply for assistance awards to fund eligible grant activities. Faith-based and other community organizations will be considered for awards on the same basis as other eligible applicants and, if they receive assistance awards, will be treated on an equal basis with all other grantees in the administration of such awards. No eligible applicant or grantee will be discriminated for or against on the basis of its religious character or affiliation, religious name, or the religious composition of its board of directors or persons working in the organization. Faith-based organizations receiving DOJ assist ance awards retain their independence and do not lose or have to modify their religious identity (e.g., removing religious symbols) to receive assistance awards. DOJ grant funds, however, may not be used to fund any inherently religious activity, such as prayer or worship. Inherently religious activi ty is permissible, although it cannot occur during an activity funded with DOJ grant funds; rather, such religious activity must be separate in time or place from the DOJ-funded program. Further, participati on in such activity by individuals receiving services must be voluntary. Programs funded by DOJ are not permitted to discriminate in the provision of services on the basis of a beneficiary's religion. If your organization is a faith-based organization that makes hiring decisions on the basis of religious belief, it may be entitled, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb, to receive federal funds and yet maintain that hiring practice, even if the law creating the funding program contains a general ban on religious discri mination in employment. For the circumstances under which this may occur, and the certifications that may be required, please see the reference to the Civil Rights Compliance section under \"Additional Requirements\" included herein. American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Tribes and/or Tribal Organizations: Applicants are limited to for-profit (commercial) organizations, non-profit organizations, faith-based and community organizations, institutions of higher learning, and consortiums with demonstrated organization and community-based experience working with Amer ican Indian and Alaska Native communities, including tribal commercial and non-profit organizations, tribal colleges and universities, and tribal consortiums. All tribal applications must be accompanied by a current authorizing resolution of the governing body of the tribal entity or other enactment of the tr ibal counsel or comparable government body. If the grant will benefit more than one tribal entity, a current authorizing resolution or other enactment of the tribal counsel or comparable government body from each tribal entity must be included. If the grant application is being submitted on behalf of a tribal entity, a letter or similar document authorizing the inclusion of the tribal entity named in the application must be included. Applicants are encouraged to review the Civil Rights Compliance section under \"Additional Requirements\" in this announcement. 5 Project-Specific Information The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-79) requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review of the incidence and effects of prison rape . The Act further specifies that the review and analysis shall be based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample, of not less than 10 percent of all federal, state, and county prisons, and a representative sample of municipal prisons. More than 8,700 facilities nationwide are covered by the Act. The Act requi res the Attorney General to submit a report , not later than June 30 of each year , listing institutions in the sample and ranking them according to the incidence of prison rape. BJS has developed a multiple-measure, multiple-met hod data collection strategy to fully implement requirements under PREA. In 2007, BJS accomplished the following activities: a) collected 2006 incident-level data from administrat ive records in all state and federal prisons and in a sample of local jails, and juvenile facilities on substantiated incidents of sexual violence; b) collected self-reports of sexual victimization from about 80,000 inmates in 146 prisons and 282 local jails nationwide; c) began implementation of the survey of adjudica ted youth in 256 state-operated local and private facilities; and, d) began collecting self-reports of sexual victimization from more than 11,500 former state inmates under active supervision in a nationally representative sample of 285 parole offices. In 2007 the national prison rape collection and reporting system were fully operational in prison and jail, with annual data reporting based on victim self-reports at the facility level. This will be the third round of collection for the NIS. As a result, the instrumentation, protocols, and sampling plans will need minimal alterations. BJS requires the use of ACASI technology for this collection, which involves inmates responding to a computer questionnaire, following audio instructions delivered via headphones. To increase confidentiality, inmates will receive one of two possible questionnaires - one on sexual assault or one on a separate topic, to be determined. All interviews will take about 30 minutes, regardless of questionnaire administered or answers provided, due to a padding function, which is also intended to increase confidentiality protection. Scope of Work The objectives of this project are to (1) refine NIS instrumentation, protocols, and sampling strategy; (2) minimize collection costs and potential disruption of facility operations; (3) maximize reliability of facility-level estimates and inmate response rate; (4) obtain approvals from an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the collection; (5) field the NIS in a sample of approximately 475 facilities (with up to 90,000 inmates) within the Federal Bureau of Prisons, state prisons, local jails, Indian country, facilities operated by or for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and military facilities; and, (6) provide the data and a complete project summary to BJS. Specifically, the Recipient of funds will: 6 1. Develop a detailed timetable for each task in the project. The data collection should begin within 12 months of the project start and be completed within 24 months. All deliverables are due within 24 months. After the BJS Project Manager (PM) has agreed to the timetable, all work must be completed as scheduled. 2. Refine the ACASI instrument and protocols for the NIS as needed. The Recipient shall modify the instrument in collaboration with the PM. The AC ASI instrument shall be fielded in English and Spanish. The instrument must maximize re spondent cooperation and confidentiality, be easily understood by a respondent with a 6th grade education, and not exceed an average respondent burden of 30 minutes. The instrument shall be tailored for use by male and female inmates in both prison and jail facilities. BJS already owns the laptop computers (Panasonic Toughbooks with touchscreen capability) that will be used to administer the survey instrument. The existing instrument is created from non-proprietary software commonly available to Government and Industry, in compliance with the Government's desire for portability in applications; any subsequent changes are subject to the same requirements. BJS retains all rights to the source code used to produce the instrument. Authoring software must be capable of producing a hard copy version of the ACASI interview instrument and the associated audio files for purposes of explaining to the PM, BJS staff, and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) exactly how the ACASI instrument is being implemented. The Recipient shall make available to the PM a draft version of the ACASI instrument (installed in a field laptop) for evaluation within 6 months of the project start. 3. Develop, test, and implement an alternative surv ey module that will serve either as a substitution or padding function for the NIS questionnaire. This module will be randomly assigned to a sample of inmates. A draft survey instrument will be provided to the Recipient by the PM within 6 months of the project start. The Recipient will be responsible for programming and implementing this additional module for the NIS. 4. Obtain IRB and OMB approvals for data collection. The Recipient, in collaboration with the PM, will submit the collection and protocols to an appropriate IRB and obtain approval. In addition, the Recipient is responsible for obtaining approval from any additional IRB's or review panels that may be required by sampled jurisdictions or facilities. Finally, the Recipient will submit a full OMB package for approval, including the supplemental survey. 5. Draw facility samples from BJS-provided fram es. The PM shall provide to the Recipient the various sampling frames necessary to draw the facility samples for prisons, jails, and other facilities (Indian country, ICE, military). BJS and the Recipient shall work collaboratively to determine the requirements of the various samples. The Act requires a 10% sample of prisons and jails across the nation, with at least one prison and one jail in each state. 6. Implement the NIS in collaboration with the PM. The Recipient, with assistance from the PM as needed, will secure cooperation and coordinate logistics with each individual facility. The Recipient shall ensure that field staff complies with all facility regulations and pass any required background checks. The Recipient shall be responsible for all subsequent logistics and case management related to field activities. 7. Deliver to BJS electronic versions of the collected data in both raw and final forms, documentation, and the final instrument on diskette and in SPSS and ASCII file format. Data collection 7 documentation should include, but is not limited to, a comprehensive codebook detailing variable positions, data coding, variable and value labels, any recoding implemented during the data cleaning process, methods used for dealing with missing data, any data allocations, weights, imputation, or non-response adjustment, and copies of all program code used to generate data or published statistics. Publication, presentation, or dissemination of the data in any form, prior to official release by BJS, is prohibited. All data and documentation from this survey may be posted on the BJS website, and data archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). 8. Meetings and Progress Reports - Formal meetings between the PM and the Recipient will be scheduled as needed. Such meetings shall take place at a location mutually acceptable to both parties. Conference calls between BJS project principals and the Recipient's Project Director shall be held at least twice per month. The Recipient shall s ubmit to the PM progress reports every six months including: (1) all activities performed during the period; (2) problems encountered and proposed or enacted solutions; (3) plans for the upcoming period; (4) a brief discussion of the expenditure of funds and a statement that indicates the percentage of the funds that have been expended; (5) and a statement as to whether the project will be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the delivery schedule and within the budgeted amount.
