The panel is required to do a comprehensive review and update of the report at least every 10 years, although more frequent major revisions are possible based on substantive information gleaned from new research and experience with practical implementation. To ensure the guidelines remain as up-to- date as possible, interim revisions (reflecting substantive updates, but of a less extensive nature than a major revision) are also accommodated.2 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONCopyright \u00a9 2020 by the American Veterinary Medical Association 1931 N.

During the past half-century, ef - forts to ensure the respectful and humane treatment of animals have garnered global attention.1,2 Concern for the welfare of animals is reflected in the growth of animal welfare science and ethics. The former is evident in the emergence of academic programs, es - tablishment of specialty colleges, implementation of curricular changes in veterinary colleges, prolifera - tion of scientific journal articles, and development of funding streams committed either partially or exclu - sively to the study of how animals are impacted by various environments and human interventions. The latter has seen the application of numerous ethical approaches (eg, rights-based theories, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, contractarianism, pragmatic ethics) to assessing the moral value of animals and the nature of the human-animal relationship.1,3-9 The proliferation of interest in animal use and care, at the national and international levels, is also apparent in recent protec - tions accorded to animals in new and amended laws and regulations, institutional and corporate policies, and purchasing and trade agreements. Changing so - cietal attitudes toward animal care and use have in - spired scrutiny of some traditional and contemporary practices applied in the management of animals used for agriculture, research and teaching, companion - ship, and recreation or entertainment and of animals encountered in the wild. Attention has also been fo - cused on conservation and the impact of human in - terventions on terrestrial and aquatic wildlife and the environment. Within these contexts, veterinarians provide leadership on how to care well for animals, including how to relieve unnecessary pain and suf - fering. In creating the 2020 and 2013 edition of the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (Guide - lines), the POE made every effort to identify and ap - ply the best research and empirical information avail - able. As new research is conducted and more practi - cal experience gained, recommended methods of eu - thanasia may change. As such, the AVMA and its POE have made a commitment to ensure the Guidelines reflect an expectation and paradigm of continuous improvement that is consistent with the obligations of the Veterinarian's Oath.10 As for other editions of the document, modifications of previous recommen - dations are also informed by continued professional and public sensitivity to the ethical care of animals. While some euthanasia methods may be utilized in slaughter (which refers to humane killing of ani - mals destined for human consumption) or harvest and depopulation, recommendations related to hu - mane slaughter and depopulation fall outside the pur - view of the Guidelines and are addressed by separate documents. The Guidelines set criteria for euthanasia, spec - ify appropriate euthanasia methods and agents, and are intended to assist veterinarians in their exercise of professional judgment. The Guidelines acknowl - edge that euthanasia is a process involving more than just what happens to an animal at the time of its death. Apart from delineating appropriate meth - ods and agents, these Guidelines also recognize the importance of considering and applying appropriate pre-euthanasia (eg, sedation) and animal handling practices, as well as attention to disposal of animals' remains. I2 Historical Context and Current Edition I2.1 HISTORY OF THE PANEL ON EUTHANASIA Since 1963 the AVMA has convened a POE to eval - uate methods and potential methods of euthanasia for the purpose of creating guidelines for veterinarians who carry out or oversee the euthanasia of animals. The scope of the 1963 edition was limited to meth - ods and recommendations applicable to dogs, cats, and other small mammals. Subsequent editions pub - lished in 1972 and 1978 encompassed more methods and species (laboratory animals and food animals, respectively), and included additional information about animals' physiologic and behavioral responses to euthanasia (specifically, pain, stress, and distress), euthanasia's effects on observers, and the economic feasibility and environmental impacts of various ap - proaches. In 1986 information on poikilothermic, aquatic, and fur-bearing wildlife was introduced; in 1993 recommendations for horses and wildlife were ABBREVIATIONS ASIC Acid-sensing ion channel CAS Controlled atmospheric stunning DEA Drug Enforcement Agency EEG Electroencephalogram or electroencephalographic EPA Environmental Protection Agency HPA Hypothalamic-pituitary axisIACUC Institutional animal care and use committee MS 222 Tricaine methanesulfonate NPCB Nonpenetrating captive bolt PCB Penetrating captive bolt POE Panel on Euthanasia SNS Sympathetic nervous system AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 5added; and in 2000 an update acknowledged a need for more research on approaches suitable for depopu - lation. An interim revision by the AVMA Animal Wel - fare Committee in 2007 incorporated information derived from an existing, but separate, AVMA policy on the use of maceration to euthanize day-old chicks, poults, and pipped eggs, and the name of the report was changed to the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. In 2013 the process for compiling the POE's report was substantially changed to include more breadth and depth of expertise in the affected spe - cies and environments in which euthana sia is per - formed. More than 3 years of deliberation by more than 60 individuals, including veterinarians, an imal scientists, behaviorists, psychologists, and an an imal ethicist, resulted in robust commentary and recom - mendations. A comment period allowed AVMA mem - bers an opportunity to provide input and share their experiences directly with POE members. The 2020 iteration of the Guidelines constitutes the ninth edition of the POE's report. The process for compiling this edition was similar to that of the 2013 edition. Two years of review, discussion, and revision by the POE culminated in this edition. A comment period was held and the input from AVMA members helps ensure the resulting document is not only sci - entifically robust, but practically sound. I2.2 SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES SINCE THE LAST EDITION In this interim update of the Guidelines, meth - ods, techniques, and agents of euthanasia have been updated and de tailed descriptions have been includ - ed to assist veter inarians in applying their profession - al judgment. Spe cies-specific sections have been ex - panded or added to include more guidance for terres - trial and aquatic species kept for a variety of purposes and under dif ferent conditions. Where possible, ap - propriate flowcharts, illustrations, tables, and appen - dices have been used to clarify rec ommendations. Appendices 1 and 2 may be useful as a quick refer - ence guide, but should never be used in lieu of the full text of the document by those perform ing eutha - nasia. All illustrations and figures have been moved to Appendix 3 of the document. Some of the more significant changes are as fol - lows: Language was added to clarify the distinction be - tween sedation and anesthesia. Specifically, ani - mals under sedation may be aroused to a conscious state with sufficient stimulation. Recognizing this is critical when categorizing the effects of agents and distinguishing even deep states of sedation from unconsciousness. The conditions for the use of CO2 with rodents in the laboratory have changed from a recommended 10% to 30% of the chamber or cage volume/min to a recommended 30% to 70% of the chamber or cage volume/min. The extensive literature used to make this recommendation is cited and the AVMA appreciates the proactive efforts made by the in - ternational research community to provide the evidence needed to make this determination. Euthanasia techniques appropriate for use with rabbits raised for meat are categorized and de - scribed. This material is located in the Laboratory Animals section to place them with other tech - niques used with these species. The Animals Farmed for Food and Fiber section has been expanded to include American bison, wa - ter buffalo, camelids, and cervids. Updates to the application of captive bolt in several species have been made and new illustrations are available to assist veterinarians in proper usage. In the Avians section the recommendation for when avian embryos achieve the potential for per - ception has been amended from 50% to 80% of in - cubation for all avian eggs. This recommendation should be applied across avians with consideration for species-specific differences in development and using the best available data. I2.3 STATEMENT OF USE The Guidelines are designed for use by members of the veterinary profession who carry out or oversee the euthanasia of animals. As such, they are intended to apply only to nonhuman species. The species addressed by the practice of vet - erinary medicine are diverse. A veterinarian experi - enced with the species of interest should be consult - ed when choosing a method of euthanasia, particular - ly when little species-specific research on euthanasia has been conducted. Methods and agents selected will often be situation specific, as a means of mini - mizing potential risks to the animal's welfare and personnel safety. Given the complexity of issues that euthanasia presents, references on anatomy, physiol - ogy, natural history, husbandry, and other disciplines may assist in understanding how various methods may impact an animal during the euthanasia process. Veterinarians performing or overseeing eutha - nasia must assess the potential for animal distress due to physical discomfort, abnormal social settings, novel physical surroundings, pheromones or odors from nearby or previously euthanized animals, the presence of humans, or other factors (including im - pact on the environment and other animals). In ad - dition, human safety and perceptions, availability of trained personnel, potential infectious disease concerns, conservation or other animal population objectives, regulatory oversight that may be species specific, available equipment and facilities, options for disposal, potential secondary toxicity, and other factors must be considered. Human safety is of ut - most importance, and appropriate safety equipment, protocols, and knowledge must be available before animals are handled. Advance preparation includes protocols and supplies for addressing personnel in - jury due to animal handling or exposure to drugs and equipment used during the process. Once eutha -6 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONnasia has been carried out, death must be carefully verified. All laws and regulations pertaining to the species being euthanized, the methods employed, and the disposal of the animal's remains and/or any water containing pharmaceuticals used for euthana - sia must be followed. The POE's objective in creating the Guidelines is to provide guidance for veterinarians about how to prevent and/or relieve the pain and suffering of ani - mals that are to be euthanized. While every effort has been made to identify and recommend appropriate approaches for common species encountered under common conditions, the POE recognized there will be less than perfect situations in which a recommend - ed method of euthanasia may not be possible and a method or agent that is best under the circumstances will need to be applied. For this reason, although the Guidelines may be interpreted and understood by a broad segment of the general population, a veterinar - ian should be consulted in their application. I3 What Is Euthanasia? Euthanasia is derived from the Greek terms eu meaning good and thanatos meaning death. The term is usually used to describe ending the life of an individual animal in a way that minimizes or elimi - nates pain and distress. A good death is tantamount to the humane termination of an animal's life. In the context of these Guidelines, the veteri - narian's prima facie duty in carrying out euthanasia includes, but is not limited to, (1) their humane dis - position to induce death in a manner that is in accord with an animal's interest and/or because it is a matter of welfare, and (2) the use of humane techniques to induce the most rapid and painless and distress-free death possible. These conditions, while separate, are not mutually exclusive and are codependent. Debate exists about whether euthanasia appro - priately describes the killing of some animals at the end of biological experiments11 and of unwanted shel - ter animals. The Panel believes that evaluating the so - cial acceptability of various uses of animals and/or the rationale for inducing death in these cases is beyond its purview; however, current AVMA policy supports the use of animals for various human purposes,12 and also recognizes the need to euthanize animals that are unwanted or unfit for adoption.13 Whenever ani - mals are used by humans, good animal care practices should be implemented and adherence to those good practices should be enforced. When evaluating our responsibilities toward animals, it is important to be sensitive to the context and the practical realities of the various types of human-animal relationships. Impacts on animals may not always be the center of the valuation process, and there is disagreement on how to account for conflicting interspecific interests. The Panel recognizes these are complex issues since how to bring about a \"good death\" for animals is re - garded as \"essentially contested\" (morally and con - ceptually),14 raising concerns across a large number of domains, including scientific, ethical, economic, environmental, political, and social. I3.1 A GOOD DEATH AS A MATTER OF HUMANE DISPOSITION Humane disposition reflects the veterinarian's desire to do what is best for the animal and serves to bring about the best possible outcome for the animal. Thus, euthanasia as a matter of humane disposition can be either intent or outcome based. Euthanasia as a matter of humane disposition oc - curs when death is a welcome event and continued existence is not an attractive option for the animal as perceived by the owner and veterinarian. When animals are plagued by disease that produces insur - mountable suffering, it can be argued that continuing to live is worse for the animal than death or that the animal no longer has an interest in living. The hu - mane disposition is to act for the sake of the animal or its interests, because the animal will not be harmed by the loss of life. Instead, there is consensus that the animal will be relieved of an unbearable burden. As an example, when treating a companion animal that is suffering severely at the end of life due to a debilitating terminal illness, a veterinarian may rec - ommend euthanasia, because the loss of life (and at - tendant natural decline in physical and psychological faculties) to the animal is not relatively worse com - pared with a continued existence that is filled with prolonged illness, suffering, and duress. In this case, euthanasia does not deprive the animal of the oppor - tunity to enjoy more goods of life (ie, to have more satisfactions fulfilled or enjoy more pleasurable expe - riences). And, these opportunities or experiences are much fewer or lesser in intensity than the presence or intensity of negative states or affect. Death, in this case, may be a welcome event and euthanasia helps to bring this about, because the animal's life is not worth living but, rather, is worth avoiding. Veterinarians may also be motivated to bring about the best outcome for the animal. Often, veteri - narians face the difficult question of trying to decide (or helping the animal's owner to decide) when eu - thanasia would be a good outcome. In making this de - cision many veterinarians appeal to indices of welfare or quality of life. Scientists have described welfare as having 3 components: that the animal functions well, feels well, and has the capacity to perform behaviors that are innate or species-specific adaptations15-17 (an alternative view is also available18). An animal has good welfare if, overall, its life has positive value for it. When an animal no longer continues to enjoy good welfare (when it no longer has a life worth living be - cause, on balance, its life no longer has positive value for it, or will shortly be overcome by negative states), the humane thing to do is to give it a good death. Eu - thanasia relieves the animal's suffering, which is the desired outcome. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 7I3.2 A GOOD DEATH AS A MATTER OF HUMANE TECHNIQUE When the decision has been made to euthanize and the goal is to minimize pain, distress, and nega - tive effect to the animal, the humaneness of the tech - nique (ie, how we bring about the death of animals) is also an important ethical issue. As veterinarians and human beings it is our responsibility to ensure that if an animal's life is to be taken, it is done with the highest degree of respect, and with an emphasis on making the death as painless and distress free as possible. When euthanasia is the preferred option, the technique employed should result in rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and, ultimately, a loss of brain function. In ad - dition, animal handling and the euthanasia technique should minimize distress experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciousness. The POE recognized that complete absence of pain and distress cannot al - ways be achieved. The Guidelines attempt to balance the ideal of minimal pain and distress with the real - ity of the many environments in which euthanasia is performed. While recommendations are made, it is impor - tant for those utilizing these recommendations to un - derstand that, in some instances, agents and methods of euthanasia identified as appropriate for a particular species may not be available or may become less than an ideal choice due to differences in circumstances. Conversely, when settings are atypical, methods nor - mally not considered appropriate may become the method of choice. Under such conditions, the hu - maneness (or perceived lack thereof) of the method used to bring about the death of an animal may be distinguished from the intent or outcome associated with an act of killing. Following this reasoning, it may still be an act of euthanasia to kill an animal in a man - ner that is not perfectly humane or that would not be considered appropriate in other contexts. For exam - ple, due to lack of control over free-ranging wildlife and the stress associated with close human contact, use of a firearm may be the most appropriate means of euthanasia. Also, shooting a suffering animal that is in extremis, instead of catching and transporting it to a clinic to euthanize it using a method normally considered to be appropriate (eg, barbiturates), is consistent with one interpretation of a good death. The former method promotes the animal's overall in - terests by ending its misery quickly, even though the latter technique may be considered to be more ac - ceptable under normal conditions.19 Neither of these examples, however, absolves the individual from their responsibility to ensure that recommended methods and agents of euthanasia are preferentially used. I4 Euthanasia and Veterinary Medical Ethics The AVMA has worked to ensure that veterinar - ians remain educated about public discourse around animal ethics and animal welfare issues and that they are able to participate in meaningful ways. While an essential ingredient in public discourses about ani - mals, sound science is by itself inadequate to address questions of ethics and values that surround the ap - propriate treatment of animals, especially as they relate to end-of-life issues. Since the 2013 edition, a number of authors20,21 have probed in greater depth the issue of a good death for animals in both philo - sophical and ethical terms. To this end, and consis - tent with its charge, the POE hopes to provide veteri - narians, those under their supervision, and the public with well-informed and credible arguments on how to approach the ethically important and sometimes complex issue of the death of an animal. In so doing, it hopes to promote greater understanding regarding the contexts or settings involving euthanasia and the complexity of end-of-life issues involving animals. While not a regulatory body, the AVMA also hopes to offer guidance to those who may apply these Guidelines as part of regulatory structures designed to protect the welfare of animals used for human purposes. By creating and maintaining these Guidelines, the AVMA hopes to ensure that when a veterinarian or other professional intentionally kills an animal under their charge, it is done with respect for the interests of the animal and that the process is as humane as possible (ie, that it minimizes pain and distress to the animal and that death occurs as rapidly as possible). The AVMA does not take the death of nonhuman animals lightly and attempts to provide guidance for its members on both the morality and practical ne - cessity of the intentional killing of animals. Veteri - narians, in carrying out the tenets of their Oath, may be compelled to bring about the intentional death of animals for a variety of reasons. The finality of death is, in part, what makes it an ethically important issue; death forever cuts off future positive states, benefits, or opportunities.22 In cases where an animal no longer has a good life, however, its death also extinguishes permanently any and all future harms associated with poor welfare or quality of life.19 What constitutes a good life and what counts as an impoverished life, or one that has limited quality such that the death of the animal is the most humane option, are research areas in need of further study by the veterinary and eth - ics communities.23,24 Animal scientists and veterinar - ians are also investigating the processes by which an animal dies during the antemortem period and eutha - nasia methods and techniques that mitigate harmful effects.25-28 Further research is also needed regarding the different contexts within which euthanasia oc - curs, so that improvements in the performance and outcomes of euthanasia can be made. The intentional killing of healthy animals, as well as those that are impaired, is a serious concern for the public. When animals must be killed and veterinar - ians are called upon to assist, the AVMA encourages careful consideration of the decision to euthanize 8 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONand the method(s) used. This is also true for euthana - sia carried out during the course of disease control or protection of public health, as a means of domestic or wild animal population control, in conjunction with animal use in biomedical research, and in the pro - cess of food and fiber production. Killing of healthy animals under such circumstances, while unpleasant and morally challenging, is a practical necessity. The AVMA recognizes such actions as acceptable if those carrying out euthanasia adhere to strict policies, guidelines, and applicable regulations. In thinking seriously about veterinary medical ethics, veterinarians should familiarize themselves with the plurality of public moral views surround - ing animal issues and also be cognizant of personal views and complicating factors that may impact their own ethical decision-making. While the Veterinari - an's Oath,10 Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA,29 state veterinary practice acts, and other guidance emanating from veterinary professional or - ganizations and regulatory bodies provide direction for how veterinarians should interact with clients and their animals, different veterinarians may have differ - ent personal ethical values1,30 and this may impact their recommendations. In their capacity as animal advocate and client advisor, the precision and credibility of advice provid - ed by veterinarians will help to advance client com - pliance. In many instances when veterinarians are called upon to benefit society through their scientific knowledge, practical experience, and understanding of how animals are benefited and harmed, straightfor - ward answers may not be forthcoming. In such cases, veterinarians and animal welfare scientists may have to facilitate conscientious decision-making by pro - moting ethical dialogue.31-34 As advisor and conduit for information (and while respecting the autonomy of their clients to make decisions on behalf of their animals), veterinarians should advance pertinent scientific knowledge and ethical concerns related to practices and procedures so that their clients and/or society can make informed decisions.1 Veterinarians who are committed to a broad un - derstanding of the \"do no harm\" principle may have to determine whether an animal's life is worth liv - ing, especially when there is no consensus on when it is appropriate to let that life go. While welfare or quality of life is typically adopted as part of the as - sessment of an animal's interests, what is in an ani - mal's interest need not be singularly identified with its welfare, especially if welfare is defined narrowly and if the animal is harmed more by its continued life than its death. For example, if welfare is defined solely in terms of an animal's subjective experience, euthanasia may be warranted even if the animal is not showing signs of suffering at the present time and if there is some commitment to avoid harm. Euthanasia may be considered to be the right course to spare the animal from what is to come (in conjunction with a more holistic or objective account of what is in an animal's interest), if medical intervention would only prolong a terminal condition, or if current health conditions cannot be successfully mitigated. In these instances, intentional killing need not be motivated by narrow welfare-based interests35 but may be con - nected to the overall value of death to the animal. That some animals are subjects-of-a-life,36-39 and that human caretakers have moral responsibilities to their animals and do not want to see them endure contin - ued harm,40,41 may be factors in deciding whether death is in an animal's interest. (A subject-of-a-life is a being that is regarded as having inherent value and should not be treated as a mere means to an end. It is a being that possesses an internal existence and has needs, desires, preferences, and a psychosocial iden - tity that extends through time.3,6) In some cases (eg, animals used for research), in - tentional killing of the animal to minimize harm to it may be trumped by more pressing ends. Here, the decision to kill an animal and how to do so will be complicated by external factors, such as productivity, the greater public and general good, economics, and concern for other animals. In human-animal relation - ships there usually are other mitigating factors that are relevant besides ones pertaining only to animal welfare or the animal's interest(s). In laboratory situ - ations, for example, where animals are employed as research subjects and death may be a terminal point, animal welfare considerations are balanced against the merits of the experimental design and merits of the research. In such cases, ensuring the respectful and humane treatment of research animals will be largely up to IACUCs. These committees must apply the principles of refinement, replacement, and re - duction, and ensure a respectful death for research animals. The decision to induce death may also in - volve whether replacements can be created for the animals that are killed.42,43 These other factors might justify killing an animal, despite the fact that the ani - mal might otherwise have had a life worth living. For example, killing may be justified for disease control or public health purposes, population control, bio - medical research, or slaughter for food and/or fiber. In other instances, keeping an animal alive that does not have a life worth living can be justified (eg, re - search circumstances where it would be impractical to kill the animal or when ensuring its survival would promote a greater good19). There may be instances in which the decision to kill an animal is questionable, especially if the ani - mal is predicted to have a life worth living if it is not killed. One example is the healthy companion animal whose owner wants to euthanize it because keeping it in the home is no longer possible or convenient. In this case, the veterinarian, as advisor and animal advocate, should be able to speak frankly about the animal's condition and suggest alternatives to eutha - nasia. Prima facie, it is the ethical responsibility of vet - erinarians to direct animal owners toward euthanasia AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 9as a compassionate treatment option when the alter - native is prolonged and unrelenting suffering.44 How - ever, accommodating a pluralism of values, interests, and duties in animal ethics is challenging. This un - derscores the need for veterinarians to consider the broader context in thinking about what animal care she or he will prescribe. There are no easy reduction - ist formulas to which to appeal. In many cases, advice will need to be responsive to the needs at hand. At - tention must be given to how the welfare and suffer - ing of the animal are understood within the context of its whole life and in light of socially acceptable ways in which humans and animals interact in differ - ent environments. Because veterinarians are committed to improv - ing animal and human health and welfare, and be - cause they work tirelessly to discover causes and cures for animal diseases and promote good animal management, some may feel a sense of disquiet or de - feat when euthanasia becomes the better course of action. The POE hopes that these Guidelines and oth - er AVMA policies will assist veterinarians who may be struggling with what may seem to be gratuitous euthanasia, the acceptability of certain procedures, and the sometimes routine nature of performing eu - thanasia. Toward that end, the decision aids in Fig- ures 1 and 2a are offered as a resource. I5 Evaluating Euthanasia Methods In evaluating methods of euthanasia, the POE considered the following criteria: (1) ability to induce loss of consciousness and death with a minimum of pain and distress; (2) time required to induce loss of consciousness; (3) reliability; (4) safety of personnel; (5) irreversibility; (6) compatibility with intended animal use and purpose; (7) documented emotional effect on observers or operators; (8) compatibility with subsequent evaluation, examination, or use of tissue; (9) drug availability and human abuse poten - tial; (10) compatibility with species, age, and health status; (11) ability to maintain equipment in proper working order; (12) safety for predators or scavengers should the animal's remains be consumed; (13) legal requirements; and (14) environmental impacts of the method or disposition of the animal's remains. Euthanasia methods are classified in the Guide - lines as acceptable, acceptable with conditions, and unacceptable. Acceptable methods are those that consistently produce a humane death when used as the sole means of euthanasia. Methods accept - able with conditions are those techniques that may require certain conditions to be met to consistently produce humane death, may have greater potential for operator error or safety hazard, are not well docu - mented in the scientific literature, or may require a secondary method to ensure death. Methods accept - able with conditions are equivalent to acceptable methods when all criteria for application of a method can be met. Unacceptable techniques are those meth - ods deemed inhumane under any conditions or that the POE found posed a substantial risk to the human applying the technique. The Guidelines also include information about adjunctive methods, which are those that should not be used as a sole method of eu - thanasia, but that can be used in conjunction with other methods to bring about euthanasia. The POE recognized there will be less-than-per - fect situations in which a method of euthanasia that is listed as acceptable or acceptable with conditions may not be possible, and a method or agent that is the best under the circumstances will need to be applied. As with many other procedures involving ani - mals, some methods of euthanasia require physical handling of the animal. The amount of control and kind of restraint required will be determined by the species, breed, and size of animal involved; the de - gree of domestication, tolerance to humans, level of excitement, and prior handling experience of the ani - mal; the presence of painful injury or disease; the an - imal's social environment; and the method of eutha - nasia and competence of the person(s) performing the euthanasia. Proper handling is vital to minimize pain and distress in animals, to ensure the safety of the person performing euthanasia, and, often, to pro - tect other people and animals. Handling animals that are not accustomed to humans or that are severely injured or otherwise compromised may not be pos - sible without inducing stress, so some latitude in the means of euthanasia is needed in some situations. The POE discussed the criteria for euthanasia used in the Guidelines as they apply to circumstances when the degree of control over the animal makes it dif - ficult to ensure death without pain and distress. Pre - medication with the intent of providing anxiolysis, analgesia, somnolence for easier and safer IV access, and reduction of stage II or postmortem activity that could be distressing to personnel is strongly encour - aged to reduce animal distress and improve person - nel safety. This is particularly important for prey spe - cies, nondomesticated species, and animals enduring painful conditions. Personnel who perform euthanasia must dem - onstrate proficiency in the use of the technique in a closely supervised environment. Each facility or in - stitution where euthanasia is performed (whether a clinic, laboratory, or other setting) is responsible for training its personnel adequately to ensure the facil - ity or institution operates in compliance with federal, state, and local laws. Furthermore, experience in the humane restraint of the species of animal to be eutha - nized is important and should be expected, to ensure that animal pain and distress are minimized. Train - ing and experience should include familiarity with the normal behavior of the species being euthanized, an appreciation of how handling and restraint affect that behavior, and an understanding of the mecha - nism by which the selected technique induces loss of consciousness and death. Euthanasia should only be attempted when the necessary drugs and supplies are available to ensure a smooth procedure.10 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONSelection of the most appropriate method of eu - thanasia in any given situation depends on the spe - cies and number of animals involved, available means of animal restraint, skill of personnel, and other con - siderations. Information in the scientific literature and available from practical experience focuses pri - marily on domesticated animals, but the same general considerations should be applied to all species. Euthanasia must be performed in accord with ap - plicable federal, state, and local laws governing drug acquisition and storage, occupational safety, and methods used for euthanasia and disposal of animals, with special attention to species requirements where possible. The AVMA encourages those responsible for performing euthanasia of nonhuman animals to re - view current federal, state, and local regulations. If drugs have been used, careful consideration must be given to appropriate disposal of the animal's remains and steps should be taken to avoid environmental contamination or harm to other animals. Circumstances may arise that are not clearly cov - ered by the Guidelines. Whenever such situations arise, a veterinarian experienced with the species should apply professional judgment, knowledge of clinically acceptable techniques, professional ethos, and social conscience in selecting an appropriate technique for ending an animal's life. It is imperative that death be verified after eutha - nasia and before disposal of the animal. An animal in deep narcosis following administration of an inject - able or inhalant agent may appear to be dead, but might eventually recover. Death must be confirmed by examining the animal for cessation of vital signs. Consideration should be given to the animal species and method of euthanasia when determining appro - priate criteria for confirming death. Safe handling and disposal of the resulting ani - mal remains are also critically important when the presence of zoonotic disease, foreign animal diseas - es, or other diseases of concern to population health is suspected. Appropriate diagnostic samples should be collected for testing, pertinent regulatory authori - ties should be notified, and the animal's body should be incinerated, if possible. Use of personal protective equipment and precautions for handling biohazard - ous materials are recommended. Animals that have injured humans may require specific actions to be taken depending on local and state laws. I5.1 CONSCIOUSNESS AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness refers to the subjective or inner qualitative experience of an animal in question. In humans, consciousness is common during both sleep and anesthesia, as evidenced by dreaming.45 One de - fining feature of dreaming is that, even while con - scious, we do not experience our environment\u2014we are disconnected from it. Ideally, general anesthesia prevents the experience of surgery and pain (con - nected consciousness), as well as producing behav -ioral unresponsiveness, either by inducing uncon - sciousness or by disconnecting consciousness from the environment.45 Unconsciousness, defined as loss of individual awareness, occurs when the brain's ability to inte - grate information is blocked or disrupted. In humans, onset of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness has been functionally defined by loss of appropriate re - sponse to verbal command; in animals, by loss of the righting reflex.46,47 This definition, introduced with the discovery of general anesthesia more than 160 years ago, is still useful because it is an easily observ - able, integrated whole-animal response. Anesthetics produce unconsciousness either by preventing integration (blocking interactions among specialized brain regions) or by reducing information (shrinking the number of activity patterns available to cortical networks) received by the cerebral cortex or equivalent structure(s). Further, the abrupt loss of consciousness that occurs at a critical concentration of anesthetic implies that the integrated repertoire of neural states underlying consciousness may collapse nonlinearly.48 Cross-species data suggest that memo - ry and awareness are abolished with less than half the concentration required to abolish movement. Thus, an anesthetic state (unconsciousness and amnesia) can be produced at concentrations of anesthetic that do not prevent physical movements.47 Measurements of brain electrical function have been used to objectively quantify the unconscious state. At some level between behavioral unrespon - siveness and the induction of a flat EEG (indicating the cessation of the brain's electrical activity and brain death), consciousness must vanish. However, EEG data cannot provide definitive answers as to onset of unconsciousness. Brain function monitors based on EEG are limited in their ability to directly indicate presence or absence of unconsciousness, es - pecially around the transition point48; also, it is not always clear which EEG patterns are indicators of ac - tivation by stress or pain.28 Physical methods that destroy or render nonfunc - tional the brain regions responsible for cortical inte - gration (eg, gunshot, captive bolt, cerebral electrocu blunt force trauma, maceration) produce instan - taneous unconsciousness. When physical methods directly destroy the brain, signs of unconsciousness include immediate collapse and a several-second pe - riod of tetanic spasm, followed by slow hind limb movements of increasing frequency49-51 in cattle; however, there is species variability in this response. The corneal reflex will be absent.52 Signs of effective electrocution are loss of righting reflex, loss of eye - blink and moving object tracking, extension of the limbs, opisthotonos, downward rotation of the eye - balls, and tonic spasm changing to clonic spasm, with eventual muscle flaccidity.53,54 Decapitation and cervical dislocation as physical methods of euthanasia require separate comment. The interpretation of brain electrical activity, which AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 11can persist for up to 30 seconds following these methods,55-58 has been controversial.59 As indicated previously, EEG methods cannot provide definitive answers as to onset of unconsciousness. Other stud - ies60-63 indicate such activity does not imply the abil - ity to perceive pain and conclude that loss of con - sciousness develops rapidly. Once loss of consciousness occurs (ie, there is no longer an inner qualitative experience) subsequently observed activities, such as convulsions, vocalization, reflex struggling, breath holding, and tachypnea, can be attributed to the second stage of anesthesia, which by definition lasts from loss of consciousness to the onset of a regular breathing pattern.64,65 Thus, events observed following loss of the righting reflex are likely not consciously perceived. Some agents may induce convulsions, but these generally follow loss of consciousness. Agents inducing convulsions prior to loss of consciousness are unacceptable for eutha - nasia. I5.1.1 A R evIew Sedatives and immobilizing agents should not be confused with anesthetics, since animals are not necessarily rendered unconscious by the former 2 agents. Sedated and immobilized animals may still be aware of their environment. During anesthesia, consciousness is not necessarily associated with connectedness, responsiveness, or even recall. The concept of a transition zone between consciousness and unconsciousness has been discussed by Terlouw et al.66,67 This is especially true as it pertains to ani - mals in slaughter plants. When animals are exsangui - nated without stunning,68 EEG studies69,70 show that a corneal reflex in response to touch can occur in unconscious animals. To clarify assessment of uncon - sciousness and consciousness, it is recommended to separate signs of definite consciousness from signs of unconsciousness or death. Following this paragraph is a list of 6 signs that an animal is definitely con - scious67; the subsequent paragraph is followed by a list of 3 signs that an animal is unconscious or (brain) dead. Consciousness likely depends on integrity of the corticothalamic networks. Spontaneous respon - siveness may depend on subcortical and spinal cord networks and connectedness (namely, an awareness of one's environment) and may depend on continued information integration in corticothalamic circuits and unperturbed norepinephrinergic signaling.45,71 According to Terlouw et al,67 terrestrial animals are definitely conscious when they exhibit any 1 of these 6 indicators: standing posture, head or body righting reflex, voluntary vocalization, spontaneous blinking (no touching), eye pursuit, and response to threat or menace test (no touching). Some modification of these indicators may be required on the basis of factors such as species and developmental stage. A terrestrial animal that is unconscious and brain-dead will not have corneal reflex, eyelash reflex (in re - sponse to touch), or rhythmic breathing.67 Determin -ing similar indicators for other species of animals is desired, and research into them is highly encouraged to help practitioners distinguish between animals that are brain-dead, unconscious (by anesthesia), im - mobilized, or sedated. Following are the 6 indicators of definite consciousness, in list form: Standing posture. Head or body righting reflex. Voluntary vocalization. Spontaneous blinking (no touching). Eye pursuit. Response to threat or menace test (no touching). Before carcass disposal or invasive dressing pro - cedures occur at a slaughter plant, it should be con - firmed that an animal is unconscious or brain-dead. Ensuring that an animal is unconscious or brain-dead requires all 3 of the following indicators: Absence of corneal reflex. Absence of eyelash reflex (response to touch). Absence of rhythmic breathing.67 I5.2 PAIN AND ITS PERCEPTION Criteria for painless death can be established only after the mechanisms of pain are understood. The perception of pain is defined as a conscious experi - ence.47 The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) describes pain as \"[a]n unpleasant sen - sory and emotional experience associated with ac - tual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Activity induced in the nociceptor and nociceptive pathways by a noxious stimulus is not pain, which is always a psychological state, even though we may well appreciate that pain most often has a proximate physical cause.\"72 The perception of pain based on mammalian models requires nerve impulses from peripheral no - ciceptors to reach a functioning conscious cerebral cortex and the associated subcortical brain struc - tures. Noxious stimulation that threatens to damage or destroy tissue produces activity in primary noci - ceptors and other sensory nerve endings. In addition to mechanical and thermal stimulation, a variety of endogenous substances can generate nociceptive impulses, including prostaglandins, hydrogen ions, potassium ions, substance P, purines, histamine, bra - dykinin, and leukotrienes, as can electrical currents. Nociceptive impulses are conducted by nocicep - tor primary afferent fibers to either the spinal cord or the brainstem and 2 general sets of neural networks. Reflex withdrawal and flexion in response to noci - ceptive input are mediated at the spinal level while ascending nociceptive pathways carry impulses to the reticular cerebral cortex (somatosensory cortex and system) for sensory processing and spatial localiza - tion. Thus, movement observed in response to noci - ception can be due to spinally mediated reflex activ - ity, cerebral cortical and subcortical processing, or a combination of the two. For example, it is well rec - ognized clinically that spinally mediated nociceptive 12 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONreflexes may remain intact distal to a compressive spi - nal lesion or complete spinal transaction that blocks the ascending nociceptive pathways. In contrast, administration of a local anesthetic into the epidural space suppresses both spinally mediated pathways; in ei - ther case, noxious stimuli are not perceived as pain in conscious human or nonhuman animals because activity in the ascending pathways, and thus access to the higher cortical centers, is suppressed or blocked. It is therefore incorrect to substitute the term pain for stimuli, receptors, reflexes, or pathways because the term implies higher sensory processing associ - ated with conscious perception. Consequently, the choice of a euthanasia agent or method is less critical if it is to be used on an animal that is anesthetized or unconscious, provided that the animal does not re - gain consciousness prior to death. Pain is subjective in the sense that individuals can differ in their perceptions of pain intensity as well as in their physical and behavioral responses to it. Pain can be broadly categorized as sensory-discriminative, where the origin and the stimulus causing pain are determined, or as motivational-affective, where the severity of the stimulus is perceived and a response to it determined.73 Sensory-discriminative nociceptive processing occurs within cortical and subcortical structures using mechanisms similar to those used to process other sensory-discriminatory input and pro - vides information on stimulus intensity, duration, lo - cation, and quality. Motivational-affective processing involves the ascending reticular formation for behav - ioral and cortical arousal, as well as thalamic input to the forebrain and limbic system for perception of dis - comfort, fear, anxiety, and depression. Motivational- affective neural networks also provide strong inputs to the limbic system, hypothalamus, and autonomic nervous system for reflex activation of the cardiovas - cular, pulmonary, and pituitary-adrenal systems. Although the perception of pain requires a con - scious experience, defining consciousness, and there - fore the ability to perceive pain, across many species is quite difficult. Previously it was thought that fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates lacked the anatomic structures necessary to perceive pain as we understand it in birds and mammals. For example, the invertebrate taxa include animals with no ner - vous system (eg, sponges) and nervous systems with no ganglionation or minimal ganglionation (eg, star - fish). However, there are also invertebrate taxa with well-developed brains and/or complex behaviors that include the ability to analyze and respond to com - plex environmental cues (eg, octopus, cuttlefish, spi - ders,74,75 honeybees, butterflies, ants). Most inverte - brates do respond to noxious stimuli and many have endogenous opioids.76 Amphibians and reptiles also represent taxa with a diverse range of anatomic and physiologic charac - teristics such that it is often difficult to ascertain that an amphibian or reptile is, in fact, dead. Although amphibians and reptiles respond to noxious stimuli and are presumed to feel pain, our understanding of their nociception and response to stimuli is incom - plete. Nevertheless, there is increasing taxa-specific evidence of the efficacy of analgesics to minimize the impact of noxious stimuli on these species.77,78 Con - sequently, euthanasia techniques that result in \"rapid loss of consciousness\" and \"minimize pain and dis - tress\" should be strived for, even where it is difficult to determine that these criteria have been met. Compelling recent evidence indicates finfish possess the components of nociceptive processing systems similar to those found in terrestrial verte - brates,59-65,72-80 though debate continues based on questions of the impact of quantitative differences in numbers of specific components such as unmyelin - ated C fibers in major nerve bundles. Suggestions that fish responses to pain merely represent simple reflex - es81 have been refuted by studies82,83 demonstrating forebrain and midbrain electrical activity in response to stimulation and differing with type of nociceptor stimulation. Learning and memory consolidation in trials where finfish are taught to avoid noxious stimuli have moved the issue of fish cognition and sentience forward84 to the point where the preponderance of accumulated evidence supports the position that fin - fish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates in regard to relief from pain. The POE was not able to identify similar studies of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish), amphibians, rep - tiles, and invertebrates, but believes that available information suggests that efforts to relieve pain and distress for these taxa are warranted, unless further investigation disproves a capacity to feel pain or dis - tress. While there is ongoing debate about fishes', am - phibians', reptiles', and invertebrate animals' ability to feel pain or otherwise experience compromised welfare, they do respond to noxious stimuli. Conse - quently, the Guidelines assume that a conservative and humane approach to the care of any creature is warranted, justifiable, and expected by society. Eu - thanasia methods should be employed that minimize the potential for distress or pain in all animal taxa, and these methods should be modified as new taxa- specific knowledge of their physiology and anatomy is acquired. I5.3 STRESS AND DISTRESS An understanding of the continuum that repre - sents stress and distress is essential for evaluating techniques that minimize any distress experienced by an animal being euthanized. Stress has been de - fined as the effect of physical, physiologic, or emo - tional factors (stressors) that induce an alteration in an animal's homeostasis or adaptive state.85 The response of an animal to stress represents the adap - tive process that is necessary to restore the baseline mental and physiologic state. These responses may involve changes in an animal's neuroendocrinologic AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 13system, autonomic nervous system, and mental sta - tus that may result in overt behavioral changes. An animal's response varies according to its experience, age, species, breed, and current physiologic and psy - chological state, as well as handling, social environ - ment, and other factors.86,87 Stress and the resulting responses have been di - vided into 3 phases.88 Eustress results when harm - less stimuli initiate adaptive responses that are ben - eficial to the animal. Neutral stress results when the animal's response to stimuli causes neither harmful nor beneficial effects to the animal. Distress results when an animal's response to stimuli interferes with its well-being and comfort.89 To avoid distress, veteri - narians should strive to euthanize animals within the animals' physical and behavioral comfort zones (eg, preferred temperatures, natural habitat, home) and, when possible, prepare a calming environment. I5.4 ANIMAL BEHAVIOR Although evaluations of euthanasia methods in the veterinary context are driven by science, clinical considerations and expectations from the public that high ethical standards will be observed may, in some cases, also play a role. When addressing euthanasia, veterinarians may disagree about what constitutes humane measures and a compassionate outcome for an animal or group of animals. This is reflective of the complexity or messiness of real-world situa - tions veterinarians can sometimes find themselves in, where difficult decisions must be made involving euthanasia, and the multifaceted nature of animal welfare. In the latter case, conceptions of animal welfare are linked to varying normative approaches to how an animal is doing as described by different human assessors.b Here, this disagreement may not necessarily involve disagreements about empirical information or clinical measures but instead may be due to a values-based disagreement about what con - stitutes good animal welfare90 or how an animal may be harmed or distressed by a particular clinical op - tion. So, while the core issue concerning euthanasia is how to bring about a good death for an animal, a disagreement may persist among veterinarians about how to weigh or weight various social and clinical trade-offs. For example, there may be disagreement over whether a quick death with some short-lived but acute distress, aversion, or suffering is preferable to one where the animal becomes unconscious over a longer period of time but does not demonstrate much behavioral aversion. More specifically, veterinarians in the laboratory context may debate which type of inhalant to use or its optimal flow rate to get rodents quicker to death or which can be anxiety producing and may not create a desired anesthetic state in the animal. Furthermore, depending on which concep - tion of welfare is emphasized, behavioral aversion as an indicator of poor animal welfare may be viewed as problematic by some but not others if, for example, more weight is given to the intensity of negative states experienced by an animal instead of the duration of exposure to a noxious agent. Measures designed to minimize pain or distress before animals become unconscious will likely achieve widespread sup - port only if veterinarians are sensitive to the variety of conceptions of animal welfare and are willing to engage openly about how animals may be impacted by various alternatives. In the context of laboratory animals, for example, resolution of a disagreement in emphasis or interpretation regarding affective states, basic functioning, and evidence of frustration, anxi - ety, or fear will likely be influenced by programmatic policies and practices that have been identified by the institution's IACUC as ensuring high animal welfare standards. The need to minimize animal distress, includ - ing negative affective or experientially based states like fear, aversion, anxiety, and apprehension, must be considered in determining the method of eutha - nasia. Ethologists and animal welfare scientists are getting better at discerning the nature and content of these states. Veterinarians and other personnel in - volved in performing euthanasia should familiarize themselves with pre-euthanasia protocols and be at - tentive to species and individual variability. For virtu - ally all animals, being placed in a novel environment is stressful91-94; therefore, a euthanasia approach that can be applied in familiar surroundings may help re - duce stress. For animals accustomed to human contact, gen - tle restraint (preferably in a familiar and safe environ - ment), careful handling, and talking during euthana - sia often have a calming effect and may also be effec - tive coping strategies for personnel.95 Sedation and/or anesthesia may assist in achieving the best conditions for euthanasia. It must be recognized that sedatives or anesthetics given at this stage that change circulation may delay the onset of the euthanasia agent. Animals that are in social groups of conspecifics or that are wild, feral, injured, or already distressed from disease pose another challenge. For example, mammals and birds that are not used to being handled have higher corticosteroid levels during handling and restraint compared with animals accustomed to frequent handling by people.96-98 For example, beef cattle that are extensively raised on pasture or range have higher corticosteroid levels when restrained in a squeeze chute compared with intensively raised dairy cattle that are always in close association with people,99,100 and being placed in a new cage has been shown to be stressful for rodents.101 Because handling may be a stressor for animals less accustomed to hu - man contact (eg, wildlife, feral species, zoo animals, and some laboratory animals), the methods of han - dling and degree of restraint (including none, such as for gunshot) required to perform euthanasia should be considered when evaluating various methods.86 When handling such animals, calming may be ac - complished by retaining them (as much as possible) in familiar environments, and by minimizing visual, 14 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONauditory, and tactile stimulation. When struggling during capture or restraint may cause pain, injury, or anxiety to the animal or danger to the operator, the use of tranquilizers, analgesics, and/or anesthetics may be necessary. A method of administration should be chosen that causes the least distress in the ani - mal for which euthanasia must be performed. Various techniques for oral delivery of sedatives to dogs and cats have been described that may be useful under these circumstances.102,103 Expressions and body postures that indicate vari - ous emotional states of animals have been described for some species.104-107 Behavioral responses to nox - ious stimuli in conscious animals include distress vocalization, struggling, attempts to escape, and de - fensive or redirected aggression. In cattle and pigs, vocalization during handling or painful procedures is associated with physiologic indicators of stress.108-110 Vocalization is associated with excessive pressure ap - plied by a restraint device.111,112 Salivation, sacs, pupillary dilata - tion, tachycardia, sweating, and reflex skeletal mus - cle contractions causing shivering, tremors, or other muscular spasms may occur in unconscious as well as conscious animals. Fear can cause immobility or play - ing dead in certain species, particularly rabbits and chickens.113 This immobility response should not be interpreted as loss of consciousness when the animal is, in fact, conscious. Distress vocalizations, fearful behavior, and release of certain odors or pheromones by a frightened animal may cause anxiety and appre - hension in other animals.114,115 Therefore, for sensitive species, it is desirable that other animals not be pres - ent when individual animal euthanasia is performed. Often, simple environmental modifications can help reduce agitation and stress, such as providing a non - slip floor for the animals to stand on, reducing noise, blocking the animal's vision with a blindfold or a bar - rier, or removing distracting stimuli that cause ani - mals to become agitated.112,116-119 I5.5 HUMAN BEHAVIOR The depth of the emotional attachment between animals and their owners or caretakers requires an additional layer of professional respect and care be - yond the ethical obligation to provide a good death for the animal. Human concerns associated with the euthanasia of healthy and unwanted animals can be particularly challenging, as can situations where the health interests of groups of animals and/or the health interests of people conflict with the welfare of individual animals (eg, animal health emergencies). The human-animal relationship should be re - spected by discussing euthanasia openly,120 providing an appropriate place to conduct the process, offering the opportunity for animal owners and/or caretakers to be present when at all possible (consistent with the best interests of the animal and the owners and caretakers), fully informing those present about what they will see (including possible unpleasant side ef -fects), and giving emotional support and information about grief counseling as needed.121-123 Regardless of the euthanasia method chosen, it is important to consider the level of understanding and perceptions of those in attendance as they witness euthanasia. When death has been achieved and verified, owners and caretakers should be verbally notified.122 Owners and caretakers are not the only people affected by the euthanasia of animals. Veterinarians and their staffs may also become attached to patients and struggle with the ethics of the caring-killing para - dox,124,125 particularly when they must end the lives of animals they have known and treated for many years. Repeating this scenario regularly may lead to emotional burnout, or compassion fatigue. The vari - ous ways in which veterinarians cope with euthana - sia have been discussed elsewhere.126 There are 6 settings in which the Panel was most aware of the potential for substantive psychological impacts of animal euthanasia on people. The first setting is the veterinary clinical setting (clinics and hospitals or mobile veterinary practices) where owners have to make decisions about whether and when to euthanize. Although many owners rely heavily on their veterinarian's judgment, others may have misgivings about making a decision. This is par - ticularly likely if an owner feels responsible for an ani - mal's medical or behavioral problem. Owners choose euthanasia for their animals for a variety of reasons, including prevention of suffering from a terminal ill - ness, their inability to care for the animal, the impact of the animal's condition on other animals or people, and/or financial considerations. The decision to eu - thanize often carries strong feelings of emotion such as guilt, sadness, shock, and disbelief.127 As society continues to pay more attention to questions about the moral status of animals, loss of animal life should be handled with the utmost respect and compassion by all animal care staff. The ability to communicate well is crucial to helping owners make end-of-life de - cisions for their animals and is a learned skill that re - quires training.128 Almost 80% of clients who recently experienced the death of a pet (87% by euthanasia) reported a pos - itive correlation between support from the veterinar - ian and staff and their ability to handle the grief asso - ciated with their pet's death.127 Owners should be giv - en the opportunity to be present during euthanasia, when feasible, and they should be prepared for what to expect.122,127,129 What drugs are being used and how the animal could respond should be discussed. Behaviors such as vocalization, agonal breaths, mus - cle twitches, failure of the eyelids to close, urination, or defecation can be distressing to owners. Counsel - ing services for owners having difficulty coping with animal death are available in some communities, and veterinarians are encouraged to seek grief support training to assist their clients.130-132 While good eu - thanasia practices (ie, client communication and edu - cation, compassionate species-appropriate handling AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 15and selection of technique, pre-euthanasia sedatives or anesthetics as needed to minimize anxiety and facilitate safe restraint, and careful confirmation of death) are often applied in the euthanasia of dogs and cats, they should also be followed for other species that are kept as pets, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, farm animals, and aquatic animals. The second setting is in animal care and control facilities where unwanted, homeless, diseased, and injured animals must be euthanized in large num - bers. The person performing euthanasia must be technically proficient (including the use of humane handling methods and familiarity with the method of euthanasia being employed), and must be able to understand and communicate to others the reasons for euthanasia and why a particular approach was selected. This requires organizational commitment to provide ongoing professional training on the lat - est methods, techniques, and materials available for euthanasia. Distress may develop among personnel directly involved in performing euthanasia repeatedly,133 and may include a psychological state characterized by a strong sense of work dissatisfaction or alienation, which may be expressed by absenteeism, belliger - ence, or careless and callous handling of animals.134 The impact on personnel may be worse when eu - thanasia is conducted in frequent, shorter sessions compared with fewer, longer sessions.135 In addition, animal shelter personnel have been shown to have more difficulty dealing emotionally with the euthana - sia of healthy, unwanted animals than those that are old, sick, injured, or wild.136 Specific coping strate - gies that can make the task more tolerable include adequate training programs so that euthanasia is per - formed competently, rotation of duties and shared responsibilities for staff performing euthanasia, peer support in the workplace, professional support as necessary, focusing on animals that are successfully adopted or returned to owners, devoting some work time to educational activities, and providing time off when workers feel distressed. Management should be aware of potential personnel problems related to animal euthanasia and determine whether it is neces - sary to institute a program to prevent, decrease, or eliminate this problem. The third setting is the laboratory. Researchers, technicians, and students may become attached to an - imals that must be euthanized in laboratory settings, even though the animals are often purpose-bred for research.137 The human-research animal bond posi - tively impacts quality of life for a variety of research animals, but those caring for the animals often experi - ence euthanasia- related stress symptoms comparable to those encountered in veterinary clinics and animal shelters.138-140 The same considerations afforded pet owners or shelter employees should be provided to those working in laboratories, particularly the provi - sion of training to promote grief coping skills.141 The fourth setting is wildlife conservation and management. Wildlife biologists, wildlife managers, and wildlife health professionals are often responsi - ble for euthanizing animals that are injured, diseased, or in excessive number or those that threaten prop - erty or human safety. Although relocation of some animals may be appropriate and attempted, reloca - tion is often only a temporary solution and may be insufficient to address a larger problem. People who must deal with these animals, especially under pub - lic pressure to save the animals rather than destroy them, can experience extreme distress and anxiety. In addition, the perceptions of not only the wildlife professionals, but of onlookers, need to be consid - ered when selecting a euthanasia method. The fifth setting is livestock and poultry produc - tion. As for shelter and laboratory animal workers, on-farm euthanasia of individual animals by farm workers charged with nurturing and raising produc - tion animals can take a heavy toll on employees both physically and emotionally.142 The sixth setting is that in which there is broad public exposure. Because euthanasia of zoo animals, animals involved in roadside or racetrack accidents, stranded marine animals, and nuisance or injured wildlife can draw public attention, human attitudes and responses must be considered whenever these animals are euthanized. Natural disasters and foreign animal disease programs also present public chal - lenges. Attention to public perceptions, however, should not outweigh the primary responsibility of doing what is in the animal's best interest under the circumstances (ie, using the most appropriate and painless euthanasia method possible). In addition to ensuring good care of animals dur - ing euthanasia and considering the psychological well-being of human participants, the physical safety of personnel handling the animals and performing euthanasia needs to be protected. The safe use of con - trolled substances and diversion control to prevent abuse is also part of the responsibility of those using such substances in the performance of euthanasia.143 I5.6 SEDATION VERSUS ANESTHESIA A distinction must be made between the terms sedation, tranquilization, and anesthesia as utilized in these Guidelines. A common characteristic of both sedatives and tranquilizers is that arousal to a conscious state can occur with sufficient stimula - tion, such that animals sedated or immobilized with these agents may still be consciously aware of, and connected to, their environment. Unlike properly ap - plied physical euthanasia methods where loss of con - sciousness is instantaneous and unambiguous (eg, captive bolt, gunshot, electrocution), application of other approved euthanasia methods requires animals be first rendered fully unconscious (eg, intracardiac pentobarbital, IV MgSO4 or KCl, exsanguination). While sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers, when administered in sufficient quantity, can produce a sleep-like state, humans may recall connected aware -16 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONness of their environment, and the same is likely true for animals. Indeed, humans experienced connect - ed awareness of their environment during sedation with dexmedetomidine sufficient to lose responsive - ness,144 and a state of surgical anesthesia could not be produced even when xylazine was administered at 55 to 88 times the usual dose (0.1 mg/kg [0.05 mg/ lb]) required to produce recumbency in cattle.c Im- mobilizing, tranquilizing, or sedative agents should not be relied on to produce a truly unresponsive, dis - connected unconscious state, regardless of the dose administered. Instead, an effective dose of a general anesthetic should be used when performing euthana - sia with methods causing distress or noxious stimula - tion prior to loss of consciousness. I6 Mechanisms of Euthanasia Euthanizing agents cause death by 3 basic mecha - nisms: (1) direct depression of neurons necessary for life function, (2) hypoxia, and (3) physical disruption of brain activity. The euthanasia process should mini - mize or eliminate pain, anxiety, and distress prior to loss of consciousness. As loss of consciousness result - ing from these mechanisms can occur at different rates, the suitability of a particular agent or method will depend on whether an animal experiences dis - tress prior to loss of consciousness. Unconsciousness, defined as loss of individual awareness, occurs when the brain's ability to inte - grate information is blocked or disrupted (see com - ments on unconsciousness for additional informa - tion). Ideally, euthanasia methods should result in rapid loss of consciousness, followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and the subsequent loss of brain function. Loss of consciousness should precede loss of muscle movement. Agents and methods that pre - vent movement through muscle paralysis, but that do not block or disrupt the cerebral cortex or equivalent structures (eg, succinylcholine, strychnine, curare, magnesium salts), are not ac - ceptable as sole agents for euthanasia of vertebrates because they result in distress and conscious percep - tion of pain prior to death. In contrast, magnesium salts are acceptable as the sole agent for euthanasia in many invertebrates due to the absence of evi - dence for cerebral activity in some members of these taxa,145,146 and there is evidence that the magnesium ion acts centrally in suppressing neural activity of cephalopods.147 Depression of the cortical neural system causes loss of consciousness followed by death. Depend - ing on the speed of onset of the particular agent or method used, release of inhibition of motor activity may be observed accompanied by vocalization and muscle contraction similar to that seen in the initial stages of anesthesia. Although distressing to observ - ers, these responses do not appear to be purposeful. Once ataxia and loss of righting reflex occur, subse - quent observed motor activity, such as convulsions, vocalization, and reflex struggling, can be attributed to the second stage of anesthesia, which by definition lasts from the loss of consciousness to the onset of a regular breathing pattern.64,65 Hypoxia is commonly achieved by exposing ani - mals to high concentrations of gases that displace oxygen (O2), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), or argon (Ar), or by exposure to carbon mon - oxide (CO) to block uptake of O2 by RBCs. Exsan - guination, an adjunctive method, is another method of inducing hypoxia, albeit indirectly, and can be a way to ensure death in an already unconscious or moribund animal. As with other euthanasia methods, some animals may exhibit motor activity or convul - sions following loss of consciousness due to hypoxia; however, this is reflex activity and is not consciously perceived by the animal. In addition, methods based on hypoxia will not be appropriate for species that are tolerant of prolonged periods of hypoxemia. Physical disruption of brain activity can be pro - duced through a blow to the skull resulting in concus - sive stunning; through direct destruction of the brain with a captive bolt, bullet, or pithing rod; or through depolarization of brain neurons following electrocu - tion. Death quickly follows when the midbrain cen - ters controlling respiration and cardiac activity fail. Convulsions and exaggerated muscle activity can fol - low loss of consciousness. Physical disruption meth - ods are often followed by exsanguination. These methods are inexpensive, humane, and painless if performed properly, and leave no drug residues in the animal's remains . Furthermore, animals presumably experience less fear and anxiety with methods that require little preparatory handling. However, physi - cal methods usually require a more direct association of the operator with the animals to be euthanized, which can be offensive to, and upsetting for, the op - erator. Physical methods must be skillfully executed to ensure a quick and humane death, because failure to do so can cause substantial suffering. In summary, the cerebral cortex or equivalent structure(s) and associated subcortical structures must be functional for pain to be perceived. If the cerebral cortex is nonfunctional because of neuronal depression, hypoxia, or physical disruption, pain is not experienced. Reflex motor activity that may oc - cur following loss of consciousness, although dis - tressing to observers, is not perceived by the animal as pain or distress. Given that we are limited to ap - plying euthanasia methods based on these 3 basic mechanisms, efforts should be directed toward edu - cating individuals involved in the euthanasia process, achieving technical proficiency, and refining the ap - plication of existing methods.148 I7 Confirmation of Death Death must be confirmed before disposal of any animal remains. A combination of criteria is most re - liable in confirming death, including lack of pulse, breathing, corneal reflex, and response to firm toe pinch; inability to hear respiratory sounds and heart - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 17beat by use of a stethoscope; graying of the mucous membranes; and rigor mortis. None of these signs alone, except rigor mortis, confirms death. In small animals, particularly in animal shelter settings, verification of death may be supplemented by percutaneous cardiac puncture after the animal is unconscious. Failure of the needle and attached syringe to move after insertion into the heart (aspi - ration of blood provides evidence of correct loca - tion) indicates lack of cardiac muscle movement and death.149 I8 Disposal of Animal Remains Regardless of the euthanasia method chosen, ani - mal remains must be handled appropriately and in ac - cord with state and local law. Regulations apply not only to the disposition of the animal's remains (eg, burial, incineration, rendering), but also to the man - agement of chemical residues (eg, pharmaceuticals [including but not limited to barbiturates, such as pentobarbital] and other residues, such as lead) that may adversely affect scavengers or result in the adul - teration of rendered products used for animal feed. Use of pentobarbital invokes legal responsibili - ties for veterinarians, animal shelters, and animal owners to properly dispose of animal remains after death. Animal remains containing pentobarbital are potentially poisonous for scavenging wildlife, includ - ing birds (eg, bald and golden eagles, vultures, hawk species, gulls, crows, ravens), carnivorous mammals (eg, bears, and domestic dogs.150 Federal laws protecting many of these species apply to secondary poisoning from animal remains containing pentobar - bital. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protec - tion Act may carry civil and criminal penalties, with fines in civil cases up to $25,000 and in criminal cases up to $500,000 and incarceration for up to 2 years.150 Serious repercussions may occur when vet - erinary health professionals who should be well-in - formed about the necessity for proper disposal of ani - mal remains fail to provide it, or fail to inform their clients how to provide it, whether there was intent to cause harm or not.151,152 Cases of suspected wildlife death from animal remains containing pentobarbital are investigated by the regional US Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement office. Recommendations by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for prevention of secondary poisoning from pentobarbital are to (1) incinerate or cremate animal remains whenever possible, (2) immediately bury deeply according to local laws and regulations, (3) securely cover or store animal remains if the ground is frozen until such time as deep burial is practical, (4) review and modify local landfill practices to pre - vent access of scavengers to legally disposed animal remains, (5) educate clients about proper disposal, (6) include a warning regarding disposal of animal remains on the euthanasia consent form, and (7) tag animal remains and outer bags or containers with prominent poison tags.150 Rendering is an important means of disposal of dead livestock and horses, and since many horses are euthanized with barbiturates, related residues can be hazardous. Rendered protein is used in animal feed for cattle, swine, poultry, fish, and companion animals, but products rendered from ruminants are prohibited by law for use in ruminant feed. Many pet food manu - facturers have lowered their acceptance thresholds for barbiturate concentrations in rendered product. Advances in analytical chemistry have spawned in - creasingly sensitive assays, and pet food manufactur - ers are using these techniques to ensure the purity of the rendered protein incorporated in their prod - ucts. Accordingly, increased analytical sensitivity has led many renderers to reconsider accepting horses euthanized using barbiturates. This places renderers and those wishing to employ rendering as a means of disposal for animals euthanized using pentobarbi - tal in a difficult position, and may result in renderers being reluctant to accept more animal remains than they can reasonably manage without creating residue concerns. Alternatives for disposal of animal remains must be considered in advance, in case the renderer cannot or will not accept animal remains containing barbiturate residues. Composting is another means of disposing of animal remains that is becoming increasingly com - mon. Studies examining the persistence of barbitu - rate residues in composted animal remains are few, but those that do exist suggest the persistence of the drugs in composted material. While the implications of this are still unclear, it does raise questions about potential environmental impacts in the case of ani - mal health emergencies or mass mortality events. Alternatives to the use of pentobarbital that may reduce the risk of secondary toxicity include general anesthesia followed by nontoxic injectable agents such as potassium chloride, or the application of physical methods such as PCB or gunshot. These al - ternatives, however, are not risk free. For example, pharmaceutical residues in animal remains other than barbiturates (eg, xylazine) may affect scaven - gers and can reduce the acceptability of the animal remains for renderers. Unfortunately, specific guid - ance from regulators regarding the use of such alter - natives is limited. The persistence of antimicrobials in animal re - mains presents parallel concerns, particularly for ani - mal remains that will be rendered. While many anti - microbials may be inactivated or destroyed through the rendering process, public health concerns associ - ated with antimicrobial resistance, coupled with the enhanced sensitivity of chemical assays and limited regulatory guidance for renderers, further complicate veterinarians' responsibilities for safe remediation. Safe handling and disposal of the resulting ani - mal remains are also critically important when zoo - notic diseases, foreign animal diseases, or diseases 18 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONof concern to population health are suspected. Ap - propriate diagnostic samples should be collected for testing, regulatory authorities must be contacted, and the animal remains must be incinerated (if possible). Personal protective equipment and precautions for handling biohazardous materials are recommended. Animals that have injured humans may require spe - cific actions to be taken depending on local and state laws. I9 Footnotes a.

Distress may be created by properties of the agent (eg, pungency, hypoxia, hypercarbia) or by the conditions under which the agent is administered (eg, home cage or dedicated chamber, gradual displacement or prefilling of the container), and may manifest itself behaviorally (eg, overt escape behaviors, approach-avoidance prefer - ences [aversion]) or physiologically (eg, changes in rate, SNS activity, HPA activity). Although SNS and HPA activation are well accepted as markers of a stress response, these systems are activated in re - sponse to both physical and psychological stressors and are not necessarily associated with higher-order CNS processing and conscious experience by the ani - mal. Furthermore, use of SNS and HPA activation to assess distress during inhalation of euthanasia agents is complicated by continued exposure to the agents during the period between loss of consciousness and death. Distress during administration of inhaled agents has been evaluated by means of both behavioral as - sessment and aversion testing. While overt behavior - al signs of distress have been reported in some stud - ies, others have not consistently found these effects. Through preference and approach-avoidance testing, all inhaled agents currently used for euthanasia have been identified as being aversive to varying degrees. Aversion is a measure of preference, and while aver - sion does not necessarily imply that the experience is painful, forcing animals into aversive situations creates distress. The conditions of exposure used for aversion studies, however, may differ from those used for stunning or killing. In addition, agents identified as being less aversive (eg, Ar or N2 gas mixtures, in - haled anesthetics) can still produce overt signs of be - havioral distress (eg, open-mouth breathing) in some species under certain conditions of administration (eg, gradual displacement). As previously noted in the section on consciousness, one of the characteristics of anesthesia in people is feeling as if one is having an out-of-body experience, suggesting a disconnection between one's sense of self and one's awareness of time and space.1 Although we cannot know for cer - tain the subjective experiences of animals, one can speculate similar feelings of disorientation may con - tribute to the observed signs of distress. As for physical methods, the conditions under which inhaled agents are administered for euthana - sia can have profound effects on an animal's response and, thus, agent suitability. Simply placing Sprague- Dawley rats into an unfamiliar exposure chamber containing room air produces arousal, if not distress.2 Pigs are social animals and prefer not to be isolated from one another; consequently, moving them to the CO2 stunning box in groups, rather than lining them up single file as needed for electric stunning, improves voluntary forward movement, reduces han - dling stress and electric prod use, and improves meat quality.3 That inhaled agents can produce distress and aversion in people raises concerns for their use in animals, in that the US Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training4 state, \"Unless the contrary is established, investigators should consider that procedures that cause pain or distress in human beings may cause pain or distress in other animals.\" Interestingly, more than 40% of human children 2 to 10 years old display distress behaviors during sevo - flurane induction, with 17% displaying significant distress and more than 30% physically resisting dur - ing induction.5 Fear in children undergoing anesthe - sia may be due to odor, feel of the mask, or a true phobia of the mask.6 Despite evidence of distress and aversion, inhaled anesthetics continue to be adminis - tered because the benefits associated with their use greatly outweigh any distress and/or aversion they may cause. The suitability of any particular inhaled agent for euthanasia therefore depends largely on distress and/ or pain experienced prior to loss of consciousness. Distress can be caused by handling, specific agent properties, or method of administration, such that a 1-size-fits-all approach cannot be easily applied. Suf - fering can be conceptualized as the product of severi - ty, incidence, and duration. As a general rule, a gentle death that takes longer is preferable to a rapid, but more distressing death7; however, in some species and under some circumstances, the most humane and pragmatic option may be exposure to an aversive agent or condition that results in rapid unconscious - ness with few or no outward signs of distress. Our goal is to identify best practices for administering inhaled agents, defining the optimal conditions for transport, handling, and agent selection and delivery to produce the least aversive and distressing experi - ence for each species. The following contingencies are common to all inhaled euthanasia agents: (1) Time to unconsciousness with inhaled agents is dependent on the displacement rate, container volume, and concentration. An understanding of the principles governing delivery of gases or vapors into enclosed spaces is necessary for ap - propriate application of both prefill and gradual displacement methods. The desired final concen - tration will be achieved more quickly by using a greater displacement rate (see M1.2). (2) Loss of consciousness will be more rapid if ani - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 23mals are initially exposed to a high concentration of the agent. However, for many agents and spe - cies, forced exposure to high concentrations can be aversive and distressing, such that gradual ex - posure may be the most pragmatic and humane option. (3) Inhaled agents must be supplied in purified form without contaminants or adulterants, typically from a commercially supplied source, cylinder, or tank, such that an effective displacement rate and/or concentration can be readily quantified. The direct application of products of combustion or sublimation is not acceptable due to unreliable or undesirable composition and/or displacement rate. (4) The equipment used to deliver and maintain in - haled agents must be in good working order and in compliance with state and federal regulations. Leaky or faulty equipment may lead to slow, dis - tressful death and may be hazardous to other ani - mals and to personnel. (5) Most inhaled agents are hazardous to animal workers because of the risk of explosions (eg, ether, CO), narcosis gases), addiction or physical abuse (eg, N2O, halocarbon anesthet - ics), or health effects resulting from chronic ex - posure (eg, N2O, CO, possibly halocarbon anes - thetics). (6) In sick or depressed animals where ventilation is decreased, agitation during induction is more likely because the rise in alveolar gas concentra - tion is delayed. A similar delayed rise in alveolar gas concentration can be observed in excited an - imals having increased cardiac output. Suitable premedication or noninhaled methods of eutha - nasia should be considered for such animals. (7) Neonatal animals appear to be resistant to hy - poxia, and because all inhaled agents ultimate - ly cause hypoxia, neonatal animals take longer to die than adults.8 Inhaled agents can be used alone in unweaned animals to induce loss of consciousness, but prolonged exposure time or a secondary method may be required to kill the unconscious animal. (8) Reptiles, amphibians, and diving birds and mam - mals have a great capacity for holding their breath and for anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, induction of anesthesia and time to loss of con - sciousness when inhaled agents are used may be greatly prolonged. Noninhaled methods of eutha - nasia should be considered for these species and a secondary method is required to kill the uncon - scious animal. (9) Rapid gas flows can produce noise or cold drafts leading to animal fright and escape behaviors. If high flows are required, equipment should be de - signed to minimize noise and gas streams blow - ing directly on the animals.(10) When possible, inhaled agents should be admin - istered under conditions where animals are most comfortable (eg, for rodents, in a darkened home cage9; for pigs, in small groups). If animals need to be combined, they should be of the same spe - cies and compatible cohorts, and, if needed, re - strained or separated so that they will not hurt themselves or others. Chambers should not be overloaded and need to be kept clean to mini - mize odors that might cause distress in animals subsequently euthanized. (11) Because some inhaled agents may be lighter or heavier than air, layering or loss of agent may permit animals to avoid exposure. Mixing can be maximized by ensuring incoming gas or vapor flow rates are sufficient. Chambers and contain - ers should be as leak free as possible. (12) Death must be verified following administration of inhaled agents. This can be done either by examination of individual animals or by adher - ence to validated exposure processes proven to result in death.10 If an animal is not dead, expo - sure must be repeated or followed with another method of euthanasia. M1.2 PRINCIPLES GOVERNING ADMINISTRATION Changes in gas concentration within any en - closed space involve 2 physical processes: 1) wash- in of new gas (or wash-out of existing gas) and 2) the time constant required for that change to occur within the container for a known flow rate. These processes are commonly combined in the practice of anesthesia to predict how quickly a change in con - centration of an inhaled anesthetic will occur within a circle rebreathing circuit.11 An understanding of how these processes work together is critical for the appropriate application of both gradual displacement and prefill immersion euthanasia methods.12 The rate of change of gas concentration within any enclosed space is a special form of nonlinear change known as an exponential process, and as such can be derived from the wash-in and wash-out exponential functions.13 Briefly, for the wash-in ex - ponential function the quantity under consideration rises toward a limiting value, at a rate that progres - sively decreases in proportion to the distance it still has to rise. In theory, the quantity approaches, but never reaches, 100%. Conversely, for the wash-out ex - ponential function the quantity under consideration falls at a rate that progressively decreases in propor - tion to the distance it still has to fall. Again, in theory, the quantity approaches, but never reaches, zero. The exponential wash-in and wash-out equations are used to derive the time constant ( ) for an en - closed volume or space. This constant is mathemati - cally equal to the enclosed volume or space undergo - ing wash-in or wash-out divided by the rate of flow, or displacement, into that space, where = volume/ flow rate.13,14 Thus, the time constant represents the 24 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONtime at which the wash-in or wash-out process would have been complete had the initial rate of change continued as a linear function rather than an expo - nential function.13 As such, the time constant is simi - lar in concept to the half-life, although they are nei - ther identical nor interchangeable.14 For the wash-in function, 1( ) is required for the concentration of the inflowing gas to rise to 63.2% of the inflowing gas concentration, 2( ) are required for the concentration to rise to 86.5%, and 3( ) are required for the concentration to rise to 95%, with () required for the gas concentration within the container to equal the inflowing gas concentration. Conversely, for the wash-out function, 1( ) is re - quired for the remaining gas concentration to fall to 36.8% of the original value, 2( ) are required for gas concentration to fall to 13.5%, 3( ) are required for gas concentration to fall to 5%, with () required for gas concentration to fall to 0% (Figure 3) . The flow, or displacement rate, therefore determines the time constant for any given enclosed volume, such that increasing the flow rate will result in a proportional reduction of the wash-in and wash-out time constants for any size chamber (and vice versa). Based on Figure 3, it can be shown that a gradual inflow or displacement rate of 20% of the chamber volume/minute represents a time constant ( ) value of 5 minutes (1 divided by 0.2/min) regardless of chamber volume. For example, CO2 displacement rate equivalent to 20% of the chamber volume/min, as recommended by Hornett and Haynes15 and Smith and Harrap,16 is predicted to increase CO2 concentra - tion from zero to 63.2% in 5 minutes (1 ), to 86.5% in 10 minutes (2 ), and to 95% in 15 minutes (3 ). An examination of the published experimental data of Smith and Harrap confirms this, where CO2 supplied at a displacement rate of 22% of chamber volume increased the CO2 concentration to approximately 64% in 4.5 minutes (1 for their chamber). Similarly, Niel and Weary17 reported 65% after 340 seconds (1 ) and 87% after 600 seconds (2 ) for a CO2 displace - ment rate of 17.5% of chamber volume/min. Prefill methods will require displacement rates of 3 to at - tain 95% of the inflow gas concentration within the chamber. Thus, gas displacement rate is critical to the hu - mane application of inhaled methods, such that an appropriate pressure-reducing regulator and flow me - ter combination or equivalent equipment with dem - onstrated capability for generating the recommended displacement rate for the size container being utilized is absolutely necessary when compressed gases are used for euthanasia. Nitrogen, Ar, and CO are all com - mercially supplied in cylinders under high pressure, but CO2 is unique in that it is supplied as a liquefied gas under high pressure. By reducing high pressure at the cylinder valve, gas flow is made constant to the flow meter as cylinder pressure decreases during use. With CO2, the regulator also acts to prevent high gas flow rates that can lead to delivery of freezing gas and dry ice snow to the animals as well as regulator icing and cylinder freezing. A distinction must be made between immersion, where animals are directly placed into a gas or vapor contained within a container, and the process of CAS as employed for the commercial stunning of poultry and hogs. Although a complete description of the op - eration of the commercial CAS systems currently in use is beyond the scope of this document, typically the entry point is open to the atmosphere with negli - gible concentrations of stunning gas present. Unlike immersion, animals are introduced at a controlled rate into a tightly controlled stunning atmospheric gradient, such that CAS can be considered to be a gradual displacement method. M1.3 INHALED ANESTHETICS Overdoses only isoflurane, enflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane are clinically available in the United States, although halothane and methoxy - flurane are still available elsewhere in the world. Hal - othane induces anesthesia rapidly and is an effective inhaled agent for euthanasia. Enflurane is less soluble in blood than halothane, but, because of its lower va - por pressure and lower potency, induction rates may be similar to those for halothane. At deep anesthetic planes, convulsions may occur. Enflurane is an effec - tive agent for euthanasia, but the associated seizure activity may be disturbing to personnel. Isoflurane is less soluble than halothane, and it induces anes - thesia more rapidly. However, it has a pungent odor and onset of unconsciousness may be delayed due to breath holding. Due to lower potency, isoflurane also may require more drug to kill an animal, compared with halothane. Sevoflurane is less potent than either isoflurane or halothane and has a lower vapor pres - sure. Anesthetic concentrations can be achieved and maintained rapidly but more drug will be required to kill the animal. Although sevoflurane is reported to possess less of an objectionable odor than isoflurane, some species may struggle violently and experience apnea when sevoflurane is administered by face mask sevoflurane induces epileptiform electrocortical activity.20 Des flurane is currently the least soluble potent inhaled anesthetic, but the vapor is quite pungent, which may slow induction. This drug is so volatile that it could displace O2 and induce hypoxemia during induction if supplemental O2 is not provided. Both diethyl ether and methoxyflurane are highly soluble, and may be accompanied by agitation because anesthetic induc - tion is quite slow. Diethyl ether is irritating to the eyes, nose, and respiratory airways; poses serious risks due to flammability and explosiveness; and has been used to create a model for stress.21-24 Although inhaled anesthetics are routinely used to produce general anesthesia in humans and animals, AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 25these agents may be aversive and distressful under certain conditions. Flecknell et al19 reported violent struggling accompanied by apnea and bradycardia in rabbits administered isoflurane, halothane, and sevo - flurane by mask or induction chamber, and conclud - ed these agents were aversive and should be avoided whenever possible. Leach et al25-27 found inhaled an - esthetic vapors to be associated with some degree of aversion in laboratory rodents, with increasing aver - sion noted as concentration increased; halothane was least aversive for rats, while halothane and enflurane were least aversive for mice. Makowska and Weary28 also reported halothane and isoflurane to be aversive to male Wistar rats, but less so than CO2. Aversion to inhaled anesthetics increases following initial expo - sure; rodents are more likely to leave the test cham - ber on second and subsequent exposures to inhaled anesthetics.29-31 This may indicate the possibility of learned aversion to these agents.32 Anesthetic vapor is inhaled until respiration ceas - es and death ensues. Because the liquid state of most inhaled anesthetics is irritating, animals should be ex - posed only to vapors. With inhaled anesthetics, ani - mals can be placed in a closed receptacle containing cotton or gauze soaked with an appropriate amount of liquid anesthetic33 or anesthetic vapor can be in - troduced from a precision vaporizer.34 Precision an - esthetic vaporizers typically are limited to 5% to 7% maximum output between 0.5 and 10 L/min O2 flow rate. Induction time will be influenced by dial setting, flow rate, and size of the container; time to death may be prolonged because O2 is commonly used as the vapor carrier gas. The amount of liquid anesthetic re - quired to produce a given concentration of anesthet - ic vapor within any closed container can be readily calculated35; in the case of isoflurane, a maximum of 33% vapor can be produced at 20\u00b0C. Sufficient air or O2 must be provided during the induction period to prevent hypoxia.33 In the case of small rodents placed in a large container, there will be sufficient O2 in the chamber to prevent hypoxia. Larger species placed in small containers may initially need supplemental air or O2.33 Nitrous oxide is the least potent of the inhalation anesthetics. In humans, the minimum alveolar con - centration (defined as the median effective dose) for N2O is 104%; its potency in other species is less than half that in humans (ie, approx 200%). Because the effective dose for N2O is above 100%, it cannot be used alone at 1 atmosphere of pressure in any spe - cies without producing hypoxia prior to respiratory or cardiac arrest. As a result, animals may become distressed prior to loss of consciousness when N2O is used as the sole agent. Up to 70% N2O may be com - bined with other inhaled gases to speed the onset of anesthesia; however, the anesthetic contribution of N2O will be only half (20% to 30%) of that expected in humans due to its reduced potency in animals.36 The addition of N2O to inhaled gases may rep - resent a refinement for euthanasia. Adding 75% N2O to 5% isoflurane in oxygen reduced time to loss of righting in mice by approximately 18%, while at 20% displacement rate administration of a mixture of 60% N2O with CO2 reduced time to loss of righting by 10%.37 However, while N2O narcosis prior to CO2 in 0- to 7-day-old piglets reduced the amount of time the piglets were exposed to CO2, it did not reduce the amount of distressful behaviors observed.38 Effective procedures should be in place to reduce animal worker exposure to anesthetic vapors.39 Hu- man workplace recommended exposure limits were issued in 1977 by the National Institute of Occupa - tional Safety and Health; concentrations for haloge - nated inhaled anesthetics are not to exceed 2 ppm (1-hour ceiling) when used alone, or 0.5 ppm for ha - logenated anesthetics combined with 25-ppm N2O (time-weighted average during use). The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists has assigned a threshold limit value time-weighted aver - age of 50 ppm for N2O, 50 ppm for halothane, and 75 ppm for enflurane for an 8-hour time-weighted expo - sure. These concentrations were established because they were found to be attainable utilizing clinical scavenging techniques and there are no controlled studies proving exposure at these concentrations are safe. No National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health-recommended exposure limits exist for the 3 most currently used anesthetics (isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane), and, at present, the Oc - cupational Safety and Health Administration has no permissible exposure limits regulating these specific agents. Advantages \u2014(1) Inhaled anesthetics are par - ticularly useful for euthanasia of smaller animals ( < 7 kg [15.4 lb]) or for animals in which venipuncture may be difficult. (2) Inhaled anesthetics can be ad - ministered by several different methods depending on the circumstances and equipment available (eg, face mask, open drop where the animal is not per - mitted to directly contact the anesthetic liquid, preci - sion vaporizer, rigid sevoflurane, desflurane, methoxyflurane, and N2O are nonflammable and non - explosive under usual clinical conditions. (4) Inhaled anesthetics can be useful as the sole euthanasia agent or as part of a 2-step process, where animals are first rendered unconscious through exposure to inhaled anesthetic agents and subsequently killed via a sec - ondary method. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Inhaled anesthetics are aver - sive to rabbits and laboratory rodents and the same may be true for other species. Animals may struggle and become anxious during induction of anesthesia, with some animals exhibiting escape behaviors prior to onset of unconsciousness. Learned aversion to in - haled anesthetics occurs in rodents. Should apnea or excitement occur, time to loss of consciousness may be prolonged. (2) Ether is irritating, flammable, and explosive. Explosions have occurred when animals, euthanized with ether, were placed in an ordinary 26 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION(not explosion-proof) refrigerator or freezer and when bagged animals were placed in an incinerator. (3) Induction with methoxyflurane is unacceptably slow in some species. (4) Because of design limits on vapor output, precision anesthetic vaporizers may be associated with a longer wash-in time constant and, thus, longer induction time; time to death may be prolonged as O2 is commonly used as the vapor car - rier gas. (5) Nitrous oxide used alone will create a hypoxic atmosphere and will support combustion at high concentrations. (6) Personnel and animals may be injured by exposure to these agents. There is rec - ognized potential for human abuse of inhaled anes - thetics. (7) Because large amounts of inhaled anes - thetics are absorbed and substantial amounts remain in the body for days, even after apparent recovery,40 use of inhaled anesthetics for euthanasia is unsuitable for food-producing animals due to potential for tissue residues. General recommendations \u2014Inhaled anesthet - ics are acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of small animals ( < 7 kg) where the following con - tingencies can be met: (1) In those species where aversion or overt escape behaviors have not been noted, exposure to high concentrations resulting in rapid loss of consciousness is preferred. Otherwise, gradual-fill methods can be used, keeping in mind the effect that chamber volume, flow rate, and anesthetic concentration will have on the time constant and rate of rise of anesthetic concentration. Inhaled anesthet - ics can be administered as the sole euthanasia agent or as part of a 2-step process, where animals are first rendered unconscious through inhaled anesthetic agent exposure and then subsequently killed by a sec - ondary method. (2) Order of preference is isoflurane, halothane, methoxyflurane, and desflurane, with or Nitrous oxide should not be used alone. Methoxyflurane is accept - able with conditions only if other agents or methods are not available. Ether is not acceptable for eutha - nasia. (3) Although acceptable, inhaled anesthetics are generally not used for larger animals because of cost and difficulty of administration. (4) Exposure of workers to anesthetics must comply with state and federal occupational health and safety regulations. (5) Neonatal animals will require extended exposure times.41 M1.4 CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is nonflammable and nonexplosive at concentrations < 12%. Carbon monoxide is a cumulative poison that produces fatal hypoxemia; it readily combines with hemoglobin and blocks uptake of O2 by erythro - cytes by forming carboxyhemoglobin.42,43 Precisely because it is insidious, difficult to detect, and highly toxic even at low concentrations, the lethal proper - ties of CO have long been recognized; indeed, ap - proximately 50,000 emergency room visits for human CO poisoning occur in the United States annually.44In people, the clinical presentation for CO inha - lation is nonspecific, with headache, dizziness, and weakness the most common symptoms of low-level CO toxicosis. As concentrations of CO increase, these signs may be followed by decreased visual acuity, tin - nitus, nausea, progressive depression, confusion, and collapse.45 With higher-level exposure, coma, convul - sions, and cardiorespiratory arrest may occur.43 Car- bon monoxide stimulates motor centers in the brain, such that loss of consciousness may be accompanied by convulsions and muscular spasms. Distinct signs of CO toxicosis are not evident until the CO concen - tration is 0.05% in air, and acute signs do not develop until CO concentration is approximately 0.2% in air. In humans, exposure to 0.32% CO and 0.45% CO for 1 hour will induce loss of consciousness and death, respectively.46 Chronic exposure to low concentra - tions of CO may be a health hazard, especially with regard to cardiovascular disease and teratogenic ef - fects.43,44,47-49 An efficient exhaust or ventilation sys - tem is essential to prevent accidental exposure of humans. In the past, mass euthanasia was accomplished by use of 3 different methods for generating CO: (1) chemical interaction of sodium formate and sulfuric acid, (2) exhaust fumes from gasoline internal com - bustion engines, and (3) commercially compressed CO in cylinders. The first 2 techniques are associated with substantial problems such as production of oth - er gases, inadequate production of CO, inadequate gas cooling, inability to quantify delivery rate, and maintenance of equipment. Ramsey and Eilmann50 found that a concentra - tion of 8% CO caused guinea pigs to collapse in 40 seconds to 2 minutes, and death occurred within 6 minutes. When used with mink and chinchillas, CO caused collapse in 1 minute, cessation of breathing in 2 minutes, and cardiac arrest in 5 to 7 minutes.51,52 Chalifoux and Dallaire53 evaluated the physiologic and behavioral characteristics of dogs exposed to 6% CO in air, and could not determine the precise time of loss of consciousness. Electroencephalographic re - cordings revealed 20 to 25 seconds of abnormal corti - cal function, and during this period the dogs became agitated and vocalized. It is not clear whether these behavioral responses are indicative of animal dis - tress; however, humans in this phase reportedly are not distressed.42 Subsequent studies54 have revealed that tranquilization with acepromazine significantly decreases behavioral and physiologic responses of dogs euthanized with CO. Carbon monoxide is noted to be aversive to laboratory rats, but not as aversive as CO2.55 In 1 study on cats,56 CO from gasoline engine exhaust was compared with a combination of 70% CO2 plus 30% O2. Signs of agitation before loss of con - sciousness were greater for the CO2-plus-O2 combi - nation. Time to complete immobilization was greater with CO2 plus O2 (approx 90 seconds) than with CO alone (approx 56 seconds).56 In another study in neo - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 27natal pigs,57 excitation was less likely to precede loss of consciousness if animals were exposed to a slow rise in CO concentration. A study of an epidemic of avian influenza in the Netherlands in 2003 compared the use of CO2 with CO for gassing whole houses of poultry.58 The researchers noted that more convulsions were ob - served in the presence of CO and recommended that CO2 was the preferred agent for this application due to safety regulations required for the use of CO. Advantages \u2014(1) Carbon monoxide induces loss of consciousness without pain and with minimal dis - cernible discomfort, depending on species. (2) Hy - poxemia induced by CO is insidious. (3) Death occurs rapidly if concentrations of 4% to 6% are used. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Carbon monoxide is an aversive agent for laboratory rodents and the same may be true for other species. (2) Safeguards must be taken to prevent and monitor exposure of personnel. (3) Electrical equipment exposed to CO (eg, lights and fans) must be spark free and explosion proof. General recommendations \u2014Carbon monoxide is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia, provided all of the following contingencies are met: (1) Person - nel using CO must be instructed thoroughly in its use and must understand its hazards and limitations. (2) The CO chamber must be of the highest-quality con - struction and should allow for separation of individual animals. If animals need to be combined, they should be of the same species, and, if needed, restrained or separated so that they will not hurt themselves or oth - ers. Chambers should not be overloaded and need to be kept clean to minimize odors that might distress animals that are subsequently euthanized. (3) The CO source and chamber must be located in a well- ventilated environment, preferably out-of-doors. (4) The chamber must be well lighted and must allow personnel direct observation of animals. (5) The CO flow rate should be adequate to rapidly achieve a uni - form CO concentration of at least 6% after animals are placed in the chamber, except for those species (eg, neonatal pigs) where it has been shown that less agita - tion occurs with a gradual rise in CO concentration.57 (6) If the chamber is inside a room, CO monitors must be placed in the room to warn personnel of hazard - ous concentrations. (7) It is essential that CO use be in compliance with state and federal occupational health and safety regulations. (8) Carbon monoxide must be supplied in a precisely regulated and purified form without contaminants or adulterants, typically from a commercially supplied cylinder or tank. The direct application of products of combustion or sub - limation is not acceptable due to unreliable or unde - sirable composition and/or displacement rate. As gas displacement rate is critical to the humane application of CO, an appropriate pressure-reducing regulator and flow meter combination or equivalent equipment with demonstrated capability for generating the rec - ommended displacement rate for the size container being utilized is absolutely necessary.M1.5 NITROGEN, ARGON Nitrogen and Ar are odorless, colorless, and tasteless gases that are inert, nonflammable, and nonexplosive. Nitrogen normally comprises 78% of atmospheric air, whereas Ar comprises < 1%. These gases function in the current context by displacing air (and the O2 it contains), causing anoxia. Exposure of Sprague-Dawley rats to severe hypoxic conditions (< 2% O2) using either gas leads to unconsciousness around 90 seconds and death after 3 minutes using Ar or 7 minutes using N22; similar findings have been reported for dogs, rabbits, and mink.51,52,59,60 Male Sprague-Dawley rats become hyperpneic, but can survive for more than 20 minutes in Ar or N2 at an O2 concentration of 4.9%.61 Rats are sensitive to even small changes in the concentration of O2, and are able to detect concen - trations both lower and higher than the 20.9% nor - mally found in air.62 Rats and mice allowed to travel between chambers containing different gases spent most of their time in the control chamber (contain - ing air), but preferred a hypoxic chamber (contain - ing Ar) to a chamber containing CO2; however, the animals stayed only a few seconds in either gas.25-27 Even when rats were trained to enter a chamber for a food reward they typically refused to enter, or left immediately after entering, when the atmosphere was hypoxic ( < 2% O2, 90% Ar).63 When rats were exposed to gradually decreasing concentrations of O2 and increasing concentrations of Ar, they always left the chamber before losing consciousness (typically when O2 declined to about 7%).64 With N2 flowing at a rate of 39% of chamber volume/min ( = 2 min - utes 34 seconds), rats collapsed in approximately 3 minutes and stopped breathing in 5 to 6 minutes; re - gardless of flow rate, signs of panic and distress were evident before the rats collapsed and died.15 During forced exposure to Ar gradually filling a chamber at a rate of 50% of the chamber volume/min ( = 2 minutes), male Sprague-Dawley rats showed open- mouthed breathing and seizure-like behavior prior to loss of consciousness, suggesting similar potential for distress.65 These observations are not surprising, as gradual displacement methods using N2 or Ar, alone or mixed with other gases, are predicted by the wash- in and wash-out functions to result in prolonged ex - posure to hypoxic conditions. In contrast, hypoxia produced by inert gases such as N2 and Ar appears to cause little or no aversion in turkeys66 or chickens67; these animals freely entered a chamber containing < 2% O2 and > 90% Ar. When Ar was used to euthanize chickens, exposure to a chamber prefilled with Ar, with an O2 concentration of < 2%, led to EEG changes and collapse in 9 to 12 seconds. Birds removed from the chamber at 15 to 17 seconds failed to respond to comb pinching. Contin - ued exposure led to convulsions at 20 to 24 seconds. Somatosensory evoked potentials were lost at 24 to 34 seconds, and the EEG became isoelectric at 57 to 66 seconds.68 With turkeys, immersion in 90% Ar 28 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONwith 2% residual O2 led to EEG suppression in 41 sec - onds, loss of Somatosensory evoked potential in 44 seconds, and isoelectric EEG in 101 seconds, leading the authors to conclude exposure times > 3 minutes were necessary to kill all birds.69 Failure to maintain < 2% O2 prolongs survival.70,71 Gerritzen et al72 also reported that chickens did not avoid chambers con - taining < 2% O2; birds gradually became unconscious without showing signs of distress. Chickens72-75 and turkeys66 killed by hypoxia show less head shaking and open-beak breathing than birds exposed to CO2. Hypoxia produced by N2 and Ar appears to re - duce, but not eliminate, aversive responses in pigs. Pigs chose to place their head in a hypoxic ( < 2% O2, 90% Ar) chamber containing a food reward, re - mained with their head in the chamber until they became ataxic, and freely returned to the chamber once they regained posture.76 In contrast, exposure to 90% Ar, 70% N2/30% CO2, and 85% N2/15% CO2 all resulted in signs of aversion, defined by the authors as escape attempts and gasping; however, the propor - tion of pigs showing these behaviors was lowest with Ar.77 Early removal from the stunning atmosphere re - sults in rapid regaining of consciousness, such that exposure times > 7 minutes are needed to ensure kill - ing with these gases.78 Mink will also enter into a hypoxic chamber ( < 2% O2, 90% Ar), but will not remain until the point of unconsciousness. The duration of hypoxic exposure freely chosen is similar to the average duration of a dive for mink, suggesting they are able to detect hy - poxia and modify their behavior to avoid detrimental effects.79 Advantages \u2014(1) Nitrogen and Ar do not appear to be directly aversive to chickens or turkeys, and the resulting hypoxia appears to be nonaversive or only mildly aversive to these species. Similarly, N2 and Ar gas mixtures do not appear to be directly aversive to pigs and appear to reduce, but not eliminate, the behavioral responses to hypoxia. (2) Nitrogen and Ar are nonflammable, nonexplosive, and readily avail - able as compressed gases. (3) Hazards to person - nel are minimal when used with properly designed equipment. (4) Argon and N2-CO2 gas mixtures are heavier than air and can be contained within an ap - paratus into which animals and birds can be lowered or immersed.77 Disadvantages \u2014(1) Hypoxia resulting from ex - posure to these gases is aversive to rats, mice, and mink. (2) Based on the wash-in and wash-out func - tions, gradual displacement methods using N2 or Ar, alone or mixed with other gases, may result in exposure to hypoxic conditions prior to loss of con - sciousness. Loss of consciousness will be preceded by open-mouth breathing and hyperpnea, which may be distressing for nonavian species. (3) Reestablish - ing a low concentration of O2 (ie, 6% or greater) in the chamber before death will allow immediate recov - ery.76,78,80 (4) Exposure times > 7 minutes are needed to ensure killing of pigs. (5) As with CO2, rats eutha -nized with Ar demonstrate alveolar hemorrhage con - sistent with terminal asphyxiation.65 (6) Argon costs about 3 times as much as N2. (7) These gases tend to cause more convulsive wing flapping in poultry than CO2 in air mixtures. General recommendations \u2014Hypoxia resulting from exposure to Ar or N2 gas mixtures is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of chickens and tur - keys. Likewise, hypoxia resulting from Ar or N2-CO2 gas mixtures is acceptable with conditions for eutha - nasia of pigs, provided animals can be directly placed into a < 2% O2 atmosphere and exposure times > 7 minutes are used. Use of Ar or N2 is unacceptable for other mammals. These gases create an anoxic envi - ronment that is distressing for some species and aver - sive to laboratory rodents and mink; other methods of euthanasia are preferable for these species. Argon or N2 hypoxia, defined as O2 < 2%, could be used to kill these animals after they are rendered uncon - scious via an acceptable method, although prolonged exposure may be necessary to ensure death. Nitrogen, Ar, and gas mixtures containing these gases must be supplied in a precisely regulated and purified form without contaminants or adulterants, typically from a commercially supplied cylinder or tank. The direct application of products of combus - tion or sublimation is not acceptable due to unreli - able or undesirable composition or displacement rate. As gas displacement rate is critical to the humane application of these gases, an appropriate pressure- reducing regulator and flow meter combination or equivalent equipment with demonstrated capability for generating the recommended displacement rate for the size container being utilized is absolutely nec - essary. M1.6 CARBON DIOXIDE Inhalation of CO2 causes respiratory acidosis and produces a reversible anesthetic state by rapidly de - creasing intracellular pH.81 Both basal and evoked neural activity are after inhalation of 100% CO2.81-84 Inhalation of CO2 at a concentration of 7.5% increases pain threshold, and concentrations of 30% and higher cause deep anesthesia and death with prolonged exposure.16,17,85-87 Methods to administer CO2 include placing animals directly into a closed, prefilled chamber containing CO2, or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of CO2. Carbon dioxide has the potential to cause dis - tress in animals via 3 different mechanisms: (1) pain due to formation of carbonic acid on respiratory and ocular membranes, (2) production of so-called air hunger and a feeling of breathlessness, and (3) direct stimulation of ion channels within the amygdala asso - ciated with the fear response. Substantial species and strain differences are reported. Carbon dioxide may cause pain due to the forma - tion of carbonic acid when it contacts moisture on the respiratory and ocular membranes. In humans, rats, and cats, most nociceptors begin to respond at AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 29CO2 concentrations of approximately 40%.88-91 Hu- mans report discomfort begins at 30% to 50% CO2 and intensifies to overt pain with higher concentra - tions.92-94 Inhaled irritants are known to induce a reflex apnea and heart rate reduction, and these re - sponses are thought to reduce transfer of harmful substances into the body.95 In rats, 100% CO2 elicits 10%, 25%, and 50% does not,96 suggesting that grad - ual displacement methods are less likely to produce pain prior to unconsciousness in rodents where un - consciousness occurs before chamber concentration reaches levels associated with nociceptor activation.32 On the other hand, bradycardia associated with CO2 exposure in rats is reported to occur prior to loss of consciousness.97 Carbon dioxide has a key role as a respiratory stimulant, and elevated concentrations are known to cause profound effects on the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and SNS.98-100 In humans, air hunger begins at concentrations as low as 8% and this sensation intensifies with higher concentrations, becoming severe at approximately 15%.101-103 With mild increases in inspired CO2, increased ventilation results in a reduction or elimination of air hunger, but there are limits to this compensatory mechanism such that air hunger may reoccur during spontane - ous breathing with moderate hypercarbia and hypox - emia.104-106 Adding O2 to CO2 may or may not pre - clude signs of distress.94,107-109 Supplemental O2 will, however, prolong time to hypoxemic death and may delay onset of unconsciousness. Although CO2 exposure has the potential to produce a stress response, interpretation of the sub - jective experiences of animals is complicated. Boro - vsky110 found an increase in norepinephrine in rats following 30 seconds of exposure to 100% CO2. Simi - larly, Reed111 exposed rats to 20 to 25 seconds of CO2, which was sufficient to render them recumbent, un - conscious, and unresponsive, and observed 10-fold in - creases in vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations. Indirect measures of SNS activation, such as elevated heart rate and blood pressure, have been complicated by the rapid depressant effects of CO2 exposure. Ac - tivation of the HPA has also been examined during CO2 exposure. Prolonged exposure to low concentra - tions of CO2 (6% to 10%) has been to increase corticosterone in rats112,113 and cortisol in dogs.114 In a single-blind study in healthy human volunteers, a sin - gle breath of 35% CO2 was found to result in elevated cortisol concentrations and exposure was associated with an increase in fear.115 It has been suggested that responses to systemic stressors associated with im - mediate survival, such as hypoxia and hypercapnia, are likely directly relayed from brainstem nuclei and are not associated with higher-order CNS processing and conscious experience.116 In fact, Kc et al117 found that hypothalamic vasopressin-containing neurons are similarly activated in response to CO2 exposure in both awake and anesthetized rats. As stated previ -ously, assessment of the animal's response to inhaled agents, such as CO2, is complicated by continued ex - posure during the period between loss of conscious - ness and death. Distress during CO2 exposure has also been ex - amined by means of behavioral assessment and aver - sion testing. Variability in behavioral responses to CO2 has been reported for rats and mice,15-17,65,108,118- 120 pigs,76,121-124 and poultry.66,72-75,125-128 While signs of distress have been reported as occurring in ani - mals in some studies, other researchers have not con - sistently observed these effects. This may be due to variations in methods of gas exposure and types of behaviors assessed, as well as strain variability. Using preference and approach-avoidance test - ing, rats and mice show aversion to CO2 concentra - tions sufficient to induce unconsciousness,25,26 and are willing to forgo a palatable food reward to avoid exposure to CO2 concentrations of approximately 15% and higher28,63 after up to 24 hours of food depri - vation.107 Powell et al9 reported a significant increase in anxious behaviors in mice with exposure to isoflu - rane, high-flow CO2, and brightly lighted chambers. Mink will avoid a chamber containing a desirable novel object when it contains 100% CO2.129 In con - trast to other species, a large proportion of chickens and turkeys will enter a chamber containing mod - erate concentrations of CO2 (60%) to gain access to food or social contact.67,72,121 Following incapacitation and prior to loss of consciousness, birds in these stud - ies show behaviors such as open-beak breathing and head-shaking; these behaviors, however, may not be associated with distress because birds do not with - draw from CO2 when these behaviors occur.73 Thus, it appears that birds are more willing than rodents and mink to tolerate CO2 at concentrations that are sufficient to induce loss of posture, and that loss of consciousness follows shortly afterwards. Using an approach-avoidance model, a preliminary study by Withrock et al130 suggests that dairy goat kids exhibit no avoidance behaviors to 10% to 30% CO2 and do not develop conditioned aversion. Genetics may play a role in CO2 response vari - ability. Panic disorder in humans is genetically linked to enhanced sensitivity to CO2.131 The fear network, comprising the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and its brainstem projections, appears to be abnormally sensitive to CO2 in these patients.132 The genetic background of some pigs, especially excitable lines such as the Hampshire and German Landrace, has been associated with animals that react poorly to CO2 stunning, while calmer lines combining the Yorkshire or Dutch Landrace con - formations show much milder reactions.133 Given a choice, Duroc and Large White pigs will tolerate 30% CO2 to gain access to a food reward, but will forgo the reward to avoid exposure to 90% CO2, even after a 24-hour period of food deprivation.76,121 A shock with an electric prod, however, is more aversive to Land - race X Large White pigs than inhaling 60% or 90% 30 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONCO2, with pigs inhaling 60% CO2 willing to reenter the crate containing CO2.122 Until further research is conducted, one can conclude that use of CO2 may be humane for certain genetic lines of pigs and stressful for others.133 Recent studies involving mice have found regions of the amygdala associated with fear behavior to con - tain ASICs sensitive to elevated CO2.134 Fear behav - iors and aversion in response to CO2 exposure were reduced in mice in which the ASIC receptors were eliminated or inhibited, suggesting that aversive re - sponses to CO2 in rodents, and potentially other spe - cies, are mediated in part by an innate fear response. Further studies defining the presence of ASICs and their role in CO2-induced fear in other rodent strains, as well as other animal species, are warranted. As with other inhaled agents, time to uncon - sciousness with CO2 is dependent on the displace - ment rate, container volume, and concentration used. In rats, unconsciousness is induced in approximately 12 to 33 seconds with 80% to 100% CO2 and 40 to 50 seconds with 70% CO2.108,135 Similarly, a rapidly in - creasing concentration (flow rate > 50% of the cham - ber volume/minute) induces unconsciousness in only 26 to 48 seconds.16,17,29,65,109,118,136 Leake and Waters87 found that dogs exposed to 30% to 40% CO2 were anesthetized in 1 to 2 minutes. For cats, inhalation of 60% CO2 results in loss of consciousness within 45 seconds, and respiratory arrest within 5 minutes.137 For pigs, exposure to 60% to 90% CO2 causes uncon - sciousness in 14 to 30 seconds,80-82,121 with uncon - sciousness occurring prior to onset of signs of exci - tation.80,84 Euthanasia via exposure to CO2 has been described for individual birds and small groups,138 and its application to euthanasia of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and rabbits has been studied, resulting in in - formation about times to collapse, unconsciousness and death, loss of somatosensory evoked potentials, and changes in EEG. Leghorn chicks 7 days of age collapsed in 12 seconds after exposure to 97% CO2.119 Raj71 found that 2 minutes' exposure to 90% CO2 was sufficient to kill day-old chicks exposed in batches. Broilers 5 weeks of age collapsed an average of 17 seconds after entering a tunnel filled with 60% CO2.72 Unlike N2 and Ar, which must be held within a very tight range of concentration for effective eutha - nasia, CO2 can render poultry unconscious and kill over a wide range of concentrations. In tests where it took 8 seconds to achieve the target gas concen - tration, broilers and mature hens collapsed in 19 to 21 seconds at 65% CO2 and 25 to 28 seconds at 35% CO2.139 In a gradual-fill study, ducks and turkeys lost consciousness before 25% CO2 was reached and died after the concentration reached 45%.125 At 49% CO2, EEG suppression, loss of somatosensory evoked po - tentials, and EEG silence occurred in 11, 26, and 76 seconds in chickens.140 In turkeys, EEG suppression took place in an average of 21 seconds at 49% CO2, but was reduced to 13 seconds at 86% CO2. In the same report, time to loss of somatosensory evoked potentials was not affected by gas concentration, av - eraging 20, 15, and 21 seconds, but time to EEG si - lence was concentration dependent (ie, 88, 67, and 42 seconds for 49%, 65%, and 86% CO2, respectively).141 In rabbits, a 58% CO2 displacement rate result - ed in a significantly shorter time to insensibility and death than did a 28% displacement rate, with nei - ther rate reported as inducing significant distress behaviors.142 In contrast, Dalmau et al143 compared immersion of meat rabbits into a commercial stun - ning system prefilled with 70%, 80%, or 90% CO2. Loss of posture occurred within the first 30 seconds following initial exposure to CO2; however, aversion (as nasal discomfort and vocalizations) was observed for 15 seconds prior to loss of posture. Dalmau et al concluded that despite the advantages their system provides in terms of prestunning handling and irre - versibility, it is not free of animal welfare problems. As a general rule, a gentle death that takes longer is preferable to a rapid, but more distressing death.7 Gradual-fill CO2 exposure causes aversion in rodents beginning at approximately a 15% concentration and lasting to onset of unconsciousness. If an appropri - ate gradual displacement rate is used, animals will lose consciousness before CO2 concentrations be - come painful.32,65 A 20%/min gradual displacement produces unconsciousness in 106 seconds at a CO2 concentration of 30%15,17,94,109; a slower 10%/min dis - placement increases time to onset of unconscious - ness to 156 seconds at a CO2 concentration of 21%.65 A 50%/min CO2 displacement rate, while holding the chamber concentration just below 40% CO2, mini - mizes the interval between onset of labored breath - ing and recumbency in mice; however, even at these rates, mice experienced > 30 seconds between onset of dyspnea and insensibility.29 For poultry, immersion into relatively low concentrations or exposure to CO2 concentrations producing a gradual induction of un - consciousness reduces convulsions compared with immersion into N2 or Ar.74,144 Carbon dioxide may invoke involuntary (unconscious) motor activity in birds, such as flapping of the wings or other terminal movements, which can damage tissues and be discon - certing for observers119,145; wing flapping is less with CO2 than with N2 or Ar.144 Due to respiratory adaptations in immature ani - mals, reptiles, amphibians, and some burrowing and diving species (eg, lagomorphs, mustelids, aquatic birds, nonhatched birds, newly hatched chicks), high CO2 concentrations, combined with extended exposure times, follow-up exposure to hypoxemia, or a secondary euthanasia method, may be required to ensure unconsciousness and death. High CO2 con- centrations ( > 60%) and extended exposure times ( > 5 minutes) are required for effective euthanasia of newly hatched chickens.71,146 On the day of birth, rats and mice exposed to 100% CO2 required exposure times of 35 and 50 minutes, respectively, to ensure death. By 10 days of age, exposure times of 5 minutes were sufficient to ensure death.147,148 For adult mink, AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 315 minutes of exposure is sufficient to ensure death using 100% CO2, but not using 70% CO2.51 Rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus also have prolonged survival times when exposed to CO2.149 Inhaled halocarbon anesthetics have been pro - posed as alternatives to CO2 for rodent euthana - sia.7,28,34 Inhaled anesthetics also produce various degrees of aversion in rodents25-28 and are associated in other animals and humans with aversion, distress, and escape behaviors during anesthetic induction. Both mice and rats will always choose exposure to light (an aversive condition) over exposure to CO2 (more aversive) in approach-avoidance tests, while > 50% of mice and rats will tolerate first exposure to an inhalant anesthetic until they become recum - bent. However, mice and rats also show evidence of learned aversion to inhaled anesthetic agents and are more likely to escape the test chamber, and to do so more quickly, on second and subsequent exposures to inhaled anesthetics; in contrast, aversion to CO2 does not increase with subsequent exposures.32 Time to death may be prolonged as O2 is commonly used as the vapor carrier gas with precision anesthetic vapor - izers. Because large amounts of inhaled anesthetics are absorbed and substantial amounts remain in the body for days, even after apparent recovery,40 eutha - nasia via inhaled anesthetics is unsuitable for food- producing animals because of the potential for tissue residues. Effective procedures should be in place to reduce worker exposure to anesthetic vapors. While incorporating inhaled anesthetics can be considered a potential refinement to CO2 and anoxic methods, further consideration of the consequences associated with this strategy is warranted. Advantages \u2014(1) The rapid depressant, analge - sic, and anesthetic effects of CO2 are well established. (2) Carbon dioxide is readily available in compressed gas cylinders. (3) Carbon dioxide is inexpensive, non - flammable, and nonexplosive and poses minimal haz - ard to personnel when used with properly designed equipment. (4) Carbon dioxide does not result in ac - cumulation of toxic tissue residues in animals from which food is produced. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Substantial and conflict - ing differences in response to CO2 inhalation exist between and within species, strains, and breeds, making broad generalizations difficult. (2) Carbon dioxide, whether administered by prefill or gradual displacement methods, can be aversive to some spe - cies, and therefore potential exists to cause distress. (3) Because CO2 is heavier than air, layering of gas or incomplete filling of a chamber may permit ani - mals to climb or raise their heads above the effective concentrations and avoid exposure. (4) Immature individuals and some aquatic and burrowing species may have extraordinary tolerance for CO2. (5) Rep - tiles and amphibians may breathe too slowly for the use of CO2. (6) Euthanasia by exposure to CO2 with O2 supplementation may take longer than euthana - sia by other means.94,108,109 (7) Induction of loss of consciousness at concentrations < 80% may produce postmortem pulmonary and upper respiratory tract lesions.94,150 (8) Dry ice and liquid CO2 are potential sources of distress or injury if permitted to directly contact animals. (9) If animals are anesthetized with inhaled agents prior to completing the euthanasia process with CO2, sufficient time should be allowed to prevent rapid recovery during the wash-in of CO2 and the subsequent wash-out of inhaled agent.32,151 General recommendations \u2014Carbon dioxide is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia in those species where aversion or distress can be minimized. Carbon dioxide exposure using a gradual-fill method is less likely to cause pain due to nociceptor activation by carbonic acid prior to onset of unconsciousness; a displacement rate from 30% to 70% of the chamber volume/min is recommended for rodents.15,63,65,142 Consideration should be given to the benefits of us - ing a darkened home cage, while also keeping in mind the need to have the animal under observa - tion.9 Whenever gradual displacement methods are used, CO2 flow should be maintained for at least 1 minute after respiratory arrest.16 If animals need to be combined, they should be of the same species and, if needed, restrained so that they will not hurt themselves or others. Immature animals must be ex - posed to high concentrations of CO2 for an extended period of time to ensure death. Oxygen administered together with CO2 appears to provide little advantage and is not recommended for euthanasia. There is no apparent welfare advantage to killing animals with CO2 when prior exposure to inhaled anesthetics has occurred.32 The practice of immersion, where conscious ro - dents are placed directly into a container prefilled with 100% CO2, is unacceptable. A 2-step process, where animals are first rendered unconscious and then immersed into 100% CO2, is preferred when gradual displacement methods cannot be used. Fur - ther studies are necessary before CO2 immersion can be recommended for rabbits.143 Immersion of poultry in lesser concentrations is acceptable with conditions as it does not appear to be distressing. Carbon dioxide and CO2 gas mixtures must be supplied in a precisely regulated and purified form without contaminants or adulterants, typically from a commercially supplied cylinder or tank. The direct application of products of combustion or sublimation is not acceptable due to unreliable or undesirable composition and/or displacement rate. As gas dis - placement rate is critical to the humane application of CO2, an appropriate pressure-reducing regulator and flow meter or equivalent equipment with dem - onstrated capability for generating the recommended displacement rates for the size container being uti - lized is absolutely necessary.32 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONM2 Noninhaled Agents M2.1 COMMON CONSIDERATIONS Noninhaled agents of euthanasia include chemi - cal agents that are introduced into the body by means other than through direct delivery to the respiratory tract. The primary routes of their administration are parenteral injection, topical application, and immer - sion. When it is being determined whether a particu - lar drug and route of administration are appropriate for euthanasia, consideration needs to be given to the species involved, the pharmacodynamics of the chemical agent, degree of physical or chemical re - straint required, potential hazards to personnel, con - sequences of intended or unintended consumption of the animal's remains by humans and other animals, and potential hazards to the environment from chem - ical residues. Many noninhaled euthanasia agents can induce a state of unconsciousness during which mini - mal vital functions are evident but from which some animals may recover. Therefore, as for any euthanasia method, death must be confirmed prior to final dispo - sition of the animal's remains. M2.1.1 Compound Ing Products approved by the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the FDA should be used whenever fea - sible. When not feasible, euthanasia agents com - pounded in compliance with applicable guidance document(s) and compliance policy guide(s) in ef - fect at the time of euthanasia should be used whenev - er feasible.152 Use of compounded euthanasia drugs that may create human or animal health risks (eg, un - intentional ingestion by other animals) is of concern. M2.1.2 Residue/Disposal Issues Animals euthanized by chemical means must never enter the human food chain and should be dis - posed of in accord with local, state, and federal laws. Disposal of euthanized animals has become increas - ingly problematic because most rendering facilities will no longer take animals euthanized with agents that pose residue hazards (eg, barbiturates). The po - tential for ingestion of euthanasia agents is an impor - tant consideration in the euthanasia of animals that are disposed of in outdoor settings where scavenging by other animals is possible153 or when euthanized animals are fed to zoo and exotic animals.154 Veteri - narians and laypersons have been fined for causing accidental deaths of endangered birds that ingested animal remains that were poorly buried.155 Environ - mental warnings must now be included on animal euthanasia drugs approved by the FDA Center for Vet - erinary Medicine.156 M2.2 ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION M2.2.1 pARente RAl InjeCtIon The use of injectable euthanasia agents is one of the most rapid and reliable methods of performing euthanasia. It is usually the most desirable method when it can be performed without causing fear or distress in the animal. When appropriately adminis - tered, acceptable injectable euthanasia agents result in smooth loss of consciousness prior to cessation of cardiac and/or respiratory function, minimizing pain and distress to the animal. However, heightened awareness for personnel safety is imperative when using injectable euthanasia agents because needle- stick injuries involving these drugs have been shown to result in adverse effects (41.6% of the time); 17% of these adverse effects were systemic and severe.157 Intravenous injections deliver euthanasia agents directly into the vascular system, allowing for rapid distribution of the agent to the brain or neural cen - ters, resulting in rapid loss of consciousness (for some invertebrates with closed circulatory systems, intrahemolymph injection is considered analogous to IV injection).158 When the restraint necessary for giving an animal an IV injection is likely to impart added distress to the animal or pose undue risk to the operator, sedation, anesthesia, or an acceptable alternate route or method of administration should be used. Aggressive or fearful animals should be se - dated prior to restraint for IV administration of the euthanasia agent. Paralytic immobilizing agents (eg, neuromuscular blocking agents) are unacceptable as a sole means of euthanasia, because animals under their influence remain awake and able to feel pain. Having said this, there may be select circumstances (eg, for wild or feral animals) where the administra - tion of paralytic agents (eg, neuromuscular blocking agents) may be the most rapid and humane means of restraint prior to euthanasia due to their more rapid onset compared with other immobilizing agents.159 In such situations, paralytic immobilizing agents may only be used if the chosen method of euthanasia (eg, captive bolt, IV injection of euthanasia solution) can be applied immediately following immobilization. Paralytic immobilizing agents must never be used as a sole means of euthanasia, nor should they be used if delay is expected between immobilization and eu - thanasia. When intravascular administration is considered impractical or impossible, IP or intracoelomic admin - istration of a nonirritating160 barbiturate or other ap - proved solution is acceptable. In laboratory rats, addi - tion of lidocaine or bupivacaine to pentobarbital re - intraperitoneal injection.161 Intracoelomic administration of buffered MS 222a is acceptable for some poikilotherms. When injectable euthanasia agents are administered into the peritoneal or coelomic cavities, vertebrates may be slow to pass through stages I and II of anesthe - sia.162 Accordingly, they should be placed in small en - closures in quiet areas to minimize excitement and trauma. Intra-abdominal administration of euthanasia agents is an acceptable means of delivery in inverte - brates with open circulatory systems. In anesthetized mice, retrobulbar injection of no AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 33more than 200 \u00b5L of injectable anesthetic solution (ketamine:xylazine) is acceptable with conditions, resulting in death within 5 seconds of cessation of in - jection.163 Intraosseous administration of some eutha - nasia solutions to awake animals may cause pain due to the viscosity of the agent, chemical irritation, or other reasons.164 Administration of analgesics, slower injection of euthanasia agent, and other strategies that may reduce discomfort should be used where pos - sible when administering euthanasia agents through preexisting intraosseous catheters.165 Placement of intraosseous (greater tubercle of the humerus, medial aspect of the proxi - mal tibia) catheters for administration of euthanasia agents and intracardiac, intrahepatic, intrasplenic, or intrarenal injections are acceptable only when performed on anesthetized or unconscious animals (with the exception of intrahepatic injections in cats as discussed in the Companion Animals section of the text). These routes are not acceptable in awake mammals and birds due to the difficulty and unpre - dictability of performing the techniques accurately with minimal discomfort. In some poikilotherms for which intracardiac puncture is the standard means of vascular access (eg, some snakes and other reptiles), intracardiac administration of euthanasia solutions in awake animals is acceptable. With the exceptions of IM delivery of ultrapotent opioids (ie, etorphine and carfentanil) and IM anesthetics, IM, SC, intrathoracic, intrapulmonary, intrathecal, and other nonvascular injections are not acceptable routes of administration for injectable eu - thanasia agents in awake animals. M2.2.2 Imme RsIon Euthanasia of fish and some aquatic amphibians and invertebrates must take into account the vast dif - ferences in metabolism, respiration, and tolerance to cerebral hypoxia among the various aquatic species. Because aquatic animals have diverse physiologic and anatomic characteristics, optimal methods for deliv - ery of euthanasia agents will vary. In many situations, the immersion of aquatic animals in water contain - ing euthanasia agents is the best way to minimize pain and distress. The response of aquatic animals to immersion agents can vary with species, concentra - tion of agent, and quality of water; consideration of these factors should be made when selecting an ap - propriate euthanasia agent. Immersion agents added to water may be absorbed by multiple routes, includ - ing across the gills, via ingestion, and/or through the skin. Ideally, immersion agents added to water will be nonirritating to skin, eyes, and oral and respiratory tissues and will result in rapid loss of consciousness (often, but not always, measured as a loss of righting response) with minimal signs of distress or avoidance behavior. Currently there are no US FDA-approved drugs for the euthanasia of aquatic animals. United States EPA-registered agents for poisoning fish (eg, rotenone, antimycin) are not recommended as eutha - nasia agents, because their mechanisms of action and times to death do not fit the criteria for euthanasia. Additionally, the use of these agents requires a re - stricted pesticide applicator's license and extralabel use of these agents is a violation of federal law. Agents approved by the FDA as tranquilizers and anesthet - ics for fish (eg, MS 222, metomidate) have been used extralabel as euthanasia agents for aquatic animals. M2.2.3 topICAl ApplICAtIon Absorption of topically applied agents is slow and variable, making topical application an unaccept - able means of efficient delivery of euthanasia agents for most animals. Exceptions include animals with highly permeable skin to which nonirritating, rapidly absorbed agents are applied (eg, amphibians eutha - nized with benzocaine gel). Currently there are no topical euthanasia agents that are US FDA approved for any species. M2.2.4 oRAl AdmInIstRAtIon The oral route has several disadvantages when considered for administration of euthanasia agents, including lack of established drugs and doses, vari - ability in agent bioavailability and rate of absorption, potential difficulty of administration (including po - tential for aspiration), and potential for loss of agent through vomiting or regurgitation (in species that are capable of these functions). For these reasons, the oral route is unacceptable as a sole means of euthana - sia. However, the oral route is an appropriate means to deliver sedatives prior to administration of paren - teral euthanasia agents. M2.3 BARBITURIC ACID DERIVATIVES Barbiturates depress the CNS in descending or - der, beginning with the cerebral cortex, with loss of consciousness progressing to anesthesia. With an overdose, deep anesthesia progresses to apnea due to depression of the respiratory center, and this is fol - lowed by cardiac arrest. All barbituric acid derivatives used for anesthesia are acceptable for euthanasia when administered IV. There is a rapid onset of action, and loss of conscious - ness induced by barbiturates results in minimal or transient pain associated with venipuncture. Desir - able barbiturates are those that are potent, nonirritat - ing, long acting, stable in solution, and inexpensive. Sodium pentobarbital best fits these criteria and is most widely used, although others such as secobar - bital are also acceptable. More research into the ef - ficacy, speed of action, and nociceptive responses of nonvascular routes of barbiturate euthanasia solu - tions is needed before changes in recommendations for these alternate routes can be made. Advantages \u2014(1) A primary advantage of bar - biturates is speed of action. This effect depends on the dose, concentration, route, and rate of the injec -34 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONtion. (2) Barbiturates induce euthanasia smoothly, with minimal discomfort for the animal. (3) Barbitu - rates are less expensive than many other euthanasia agents. (4) Food and Drug Administration-approved barbiturate-based euthanasia solutions are readily available. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Intravenous injection is necessary for best results and this requires trained personnel. (2) Each animal must be appropriately re - strained. (3) Current federal drug regulations require strict accounting for barbiturates, and these must be used under the supervision of personnel registered with the US DEA. (4) An aesthetically objectionable terminal gasp may occur in unconscious animals. (5) Some animals may go through an excitatory phase that may be distressing to observers. (6) These drugs persist in the animal's remains and may cause seda - tion or even death of animals that consume the body. (7) Tissue artifacts (eg, splenomegaly) may occur in some species euthanized with barbiturates. General recommendations \u2014The advantages of using barbiturates for euthanasia in dogs and cats far outweigh the disadvantages. Intravenous injection of a barbituric acid derivative is the preferred method for euthanasia of dogs, cats, other small animals, and horses. Barbiturates are also acceptable for all other species of animals if circumstances permit their use. Intraperitoneal or intracoelomic injection may be used in situations when an IV injection would be dis - tressful, dangerous, or difficult due to small patient size. Intracardiac (in mammals and birds), IM, intra - hepatic, and intrarenal injections must only be used if the animal is unconscious or anesthetized (with the exception of intrahepatic injections in cats as discussed in the Companion Animals section of the text). M2.4 PENTOBARBITAL COMBINATIONS Several euthanasia products combine a barbi - turic acid derivative (usually sodium pentobarbital) with local anesthetic agents, other CNS depressants (eg, phenytoin, ethanol), or agents that metabolize to pentobarbital. Although some of the additives are slowly cardiotoxic, euthanasia makes this pharma - cologic effect inconsequential. These combination products are listed by the DEA as schedule III drugs, making them somewhat simpler to obtain, store, and administer than schedule II drugs such as sodium pentobarbital. The pharmacologic properties and rec - ommended use of euthanasia products that combine sodium pentobarbital with agents such as lidocaine or phenytoin are interchangeable with those of pure barbituric acid derivatives. Mixing of pentobarbital with a neuromuscular blocking agent in the same injection apparatus is not an acceptable approach to euthanasia because of the potential for the neuromuscular blocking agent to in - duce paralysis prior to onset of unconsciousness.M2.5 TRIBUTAME Tributame euthanasia solution is an injectable, nonbarbiturate euthanasia agent with each milliliter containing 135 mg of embutramide, 45 mg of chloro - quine phosphate USP, and 1.9 mg lidocaine USP dis - solved in water and ethyl alcohol. The final formu - lation has a teal blue color with the bittering agent, denatonium benzoate, added to minimize the risk of the solution being ingested accidentally. Tributame was approved by the FDA in 2005 as an IV agent for euthanasia of dogs, and embutramide was classified as a schedule III controlled substance in 2006, mak - ing Tributame a C-III controlled agent.166-168 Embutramide is a derivative of -hydroxybutyrate that was investigated as a general anesthetic in the late 1950s, but was never used as a pharmaceutical agent due to a poor margin of safety, with severe cardiovascular effects including hypotension, myo - cardial depression, and ventricular dysrhythmias.169 Embutramide can be injected alone to cause death, but the time until death can exceed 5 minutes. Subse - quently, chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug with profound cardiovascular depressant effects, was added to embutramide, and studies verified a signifi - cantly shorter time until death.170,171 Studies on dogs showed this combination of 2 drugs to be effective, but when tested for euthanasia of cats, a substantial response to IV injection via peripheral vein was evi - dent. This effect was almost completely eliminated by addition of lidocaine. The addition of chloroquine and lidocaine also lowers the dosage of embutramide required for euthanasia.170 Death from Tributame re - sults from severe CNS depression, hypoxia, and cir - culatory collapse. Tributame produces unconsciousness in dogs in fewer than 30 seconds, with death occurring within 2 minutes; agonal breathing may occur in 60% to 70% of patients.172 Injection is to be given IV over a period of 10 to 15 seconds through a preplaced catheter or hypodermic needle at a dosage of 1 mL for each 5 lb (0.45 mL/kg [0.2 mL/lb]). Advantages \u2014(1) Tributame has a rapid onset of action. This effect depends on the dose, concentra - tion, route, and rate of the injection. (2) Tributame in - duces euthanasia smoothly, with minimal discomfort to the animal. (3) Schedule III status makes Tributame somewhat simpler to obtain, store, and administer than Schedule II drugs such as sodium pentobarbital. Disadvantages \u2014(1) At the time of compilation of this report, while Tributame is FDA approved for use in dogs, it is not currently being manufactured. (2) Intravenous injection by trained personnel is neces - sary. (3) Each animal must be individually restrained. (4) Aesthetically objectionable agonal breathing may occur in unconscious animals. (5) The component drugs tend to persist in the animal's remains and may cause sedation or even death of animals that consume the body. General recommendations \u2014If it becomes avail - able, Tributame is an acceptable euthanasia drug for AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 35dogs provided that it is administered IV by a highly skilled person at recommended dosages and at prop - er injection rates. If barbiturates are not available, its extralabel use in cats is also acceptable. Routes of ad - ministration of Tributame other than IV injection are not acceptable. M2.6 T-61 mebozonium causes nondepolarizing muscular paralysis.173 Concern has been expressed that the paralytic effect of mebozonium occurs be - fore embutramide-induced unconsciousness, creat - ing a potential for animal distress prior to loss of con - sciousness, as manifested by muscular activity and/or vocalization during injection. However, electrophysi - ologic studies in dogs and rabbits have shown that loss of consciousness and loss of motor activity occur simultaneously following T-61 injection.174 Although many consider the aesthetically unpleasant reactions of dogs to T-61 injection to be similar to dysphoria seen during the induction phases of anesthesia, the behavior demonstrated during these reactions can cause distress in personnel witnessing euthanasia. Because of these concerns, T-61 has been voluntarily withdrawn from the market by the manufacturer and is no longer manufactured or commercially available in the United States, although it is available in Cana - da and other countries. T-61 should be administered only IV and at carefully monitored rates of injection to avoid dysphoria during injection. Advantages \u2014(1) T-61 has a rapid onset of action and has been used to euthanize dogs, cats, horses, laboratory animals, birds, and wildlife. (2) Terminal (agonal) gasps that can occur in animals euthanized by IV barbiturates are not seen with use of T-61. Disadvantages \u2014(1) T-61 is currently not being manufactured in the United States. (2) Slow IV injec - tion is necessary to avoid dysphoria prior to uncon - sciousness. (3) Each animal must be appropriately restrained and the agent must be administered by trained personnel. (4) Secondary toxicosis may occur in animals that consume remains of animals eutha - nized with T-61. (5) Because T-61 contains embutra - mide, a schedule III controlled drug, it is subject to the same restrictions in acquisition, storage, and use as other schedule III agents. General recommendations \u2014T-61 is acceptable as an agent of euthanasia provided it is administered appropriately by trained personnel. Routes of admin - istration of T-61 other than IV are not acceptable. hydrochloride and carfentanil (10,000 times as potent as morphine sulfate) that are FDA approved for the im - mobilization of wildlife.175 These opioids have been used as immobilization and extralabel euthanasia drugs primarily for large animals, particularly wild - life. Carfentanil has been used transmucosally in a lol - lipop form to euthanize captive large apes.176 These drugs act on \u00b5 opioid receptors to cause profound CNS depression, with death secondary to respiratory arrest. Advantages \u2014(1) Etorphine and carfentanil can be delivered IM or transmucosally in situations where IV administration is unfeasible or dangerous. (2) These drugs have a rapid onset of action. Disadvantages \u2014(1) These drugs are strictly regulated, require special licensing to obtain and use, and are not FDA approved for use as agents of euthanasia. (2) There is substantial risk for humans handling the drugs, which can be absorbed through broken skin or mucous membranes. (3) These opioids may pose a risk of secondary toxicosis if the remains of euthanized animals are ingested; therefore proper disposal of animal remains is essential. General recommendations\u2014 Etorphine or carfentanil is acceptable with conditions for euthana - sia only in situations where use of other euthanasia methods is impractical or dangerous. Personnel han - dling the drugs must be familiar with their hazards, and a second person must be standing by and be pre - pared to summon medical support and administer first aid in case of accidental human exposure. M2.8 DISSOCIATIVE AGENTS AND 2-adrenergic receptor agonists induce rapid loss of consciousness, and sometimes muscle relaxation, prior to surgery, dentistry, or other procedures. These agents are sometimes given prior to administration of euthana - sia solutions to minimize animal distress, facilitate restraint, and/or provide a more aesthetic euthana - sia environment for owner-attended euthanasia. In overdose situations, these agents can cause death; however, doses that consistently will produce death have not been established for most species. In mice, injection of 100 \u00b5L of a 10:1 (mg:mg) solution of ketamine:xylazine resulted in death within 3 to 5 sec - onds after completion of the injection.163 Intraperito - neal injection of dissociative agents in combination with 2-adrenergic receptor agonists at 5 times the anesthetic dose has been used as a means of euthaniz - ing laboratory animals.177 Advantages \u2014(1) These agents are readily avail - able. (2) The combination of these agents causes rap - id loss of consciousness. (3) Although IV injection for euthanasia is preferred, these combinations can be delivered IM in situations where IV administration is not feasible or is dangerous. Disadvantages \u2014(1) These agents are not FDA approved for use as agents of euthanasia. (2) Doses that consistently produce rapid death have not been established for most drugs and species. (3) The cost 36 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONof the higher doses of agents required to cause death may substantially exceed that of an approved euthana - sia agent. (4) Many dissociative agents are controlled substances and their acquisition, storage, and use are restricted. (5) Some injectable agents can be hazard - ous for human personnel if accidental exposure oc - curs. (6) The environmental impact of residues of injectable anesthetics in the remains of euthanized animals has not been determined. General recommendations\u2014 In species for which effective euthanasia doses and routes have been established, overdose of dissociative agent- 2-adrenergic combinations is an acceptable meth - od of euthanasia. These agents are acceptable with conditions in situations where approved euthanasia drugs are not available or as secondary means of eu - thanasia in already anesthetized animals provided ut - most care is taken to ensure that death has occurred prior to disposing of animal remains. These combina - tions are also acceptable as the first step in a 2-step euthanasia method. Until the environmental impact of tissue residues is determined, special care must be taken in the disposal of animal remains. Injectable an - esthetics should not be used in animals intended for consumption. M2.9 POTASSIUM CHLORIDE AND MAGNESIUM SALTS Although unacceptable when used in conscious vertebrate animals, a solution of potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, or magnesium sulfate injected IV or intracardially in an animal that is unconscious or under general anesthesia is an acceptable way to induce cardiac arrest and death. The potassium ion is cardiotoxic, and rapid IV or intracardiac administra - tion of 1 to 2 mmol/kg (0.5 to 0.9 mmol/lb) of body weight (1 to 2 mEq K+/kg; 75 to 150 mg of potassium chloride/kg [34.1 to 68.2 mg/lb]) will cause cardiac arrest.178 This is an injectable technique for euthana - sia of livestock or wildlife species that may reduce the risk of toxicosis for predators or scavengers in situa - tions where the remains of euthanized animals may be consumed.179,180 Potassium chloride injected IV at 3 mg/kg (1.4 mg/lb) into parrots anesthetized with isoflurane caused mild vocalization in 1 of 6 birds and resulted in asystole in 68 seconds.181 Use of 10 mg/ kg (4.5 mg/lb) IV in anesthetized parrots resulted in involuntary muscle tremors in 5 of 6 birds and caused asystole in 32.8 seconds. Neither dosage resulted in histologic artifacts. Magnesium salts may also be mixed in water for use as immersion euthanasia agents for some aquatic invertebrates. In these animals, magnesium salts in - duce death through suppression of \u2014(1) Potassium chloride and mag - nesium salts are not controlled substances and are easily acquired, transported, and mixed in the field. (2) Potassium chloride and magnesium salt solutions, when administered after rendering an animal uncon - scious, result in animal remains that are potentially less toxic for scavengers and predators and may be a good choice in cases where proper disposal of animal remains (eg, rendering, incineration) is impossible or impractical. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Rippling of muscle tissue and clonic spasms may occur upon or shortly after injection. (2) Potassium chloride and magnesium salt solutions are not approved by the FDA for use as eu - thanasia agents. (3) Saturated solutions are required to obtain suitable concentrations for rapid injection into large animals. General recommendations \u2014Personnel per - forming this technique must be trained and knowl - edgeable in anesthetic techniques, and be competent in assessing the level of unconsciousness that is re - quired for administration of potassium chloride and magnesium salt solutions IV. Administration of potas - sium chloride or magnesium salt solutions IV requires animals to be in a surgical plane of anesthesia charac - terized by loss of consciousness, loss of reflex muscle response, and loss of response to noxious stimuli. Use in unconscious animals (made recumbent and unresponsive to noxious stimuli) is acceptable in situ - ations where other euthanasia methods are unavail - able or not feasible. Although no scavenger toxico - ses have been reported with potassium chloride or magnesium salts in combination with a general an - esthetic, proper disposal of animal remains should always be attempted to prevent possible toxicosis by consumption of animal remains contaminated with general anesthetics. CHLORAL HYDRATE AND -CHLORALOSE Chloral hydrate used in combination with magne - sium sulfate and sodium pentobarbital as an economi - cal anesthesia and euthanasia agent for large animals, but now is rarely used for this application in veteri - nary medicine. -Chloralose is a longer-acting deriva - tive of chloral hydrate that has been used for anes - thesia of laboratory animals, particularly for study of cerebrovasculature.182,183 When administered IV, these agents have almost immediate sedative action, but unless combined with other anesthetics, the on - set of anesthesia is delayed. Death is caused by hy - poxemia resulting from progressive depression of the respiratory center, and may be preceded by gasping, muscle spasms, and vocalization. Advantages \u2014(1) Historically, chloral hydrate was an inexpensive anesthetic and euthanasia agent, making it economical for large animals. (2) Schedule IV status makes chloral hydrate somewhat simpler to obtain, store, and administer than schedule II or III drugs, such as sodium pentobarbital. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Chloral hydrate depresses the cerebrum slowly; therefore, restraint may be a problem for some animals. (2) Chloral hydrate is no longer available as an FDA-approved drug in the Unit - ed States, so it must be compounded from bulk drug. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 37This is problematic because of the lack of manufac - turing controls, tests for potency, and potential ille - gality of using products made from bulk drugs. General recommendations \u2014Chloral hydrate and -chloralose are not acceptable euthanasia agents because the associated adverse effects may be severe, reactions can be aesthetically objectionable, and other products are better choices. M2.11 ALCOHOLS Ethanol and other alcohols increase cell mem - brane fluidity, alter ion channels within neural cells, and decrease nerve cell activity.184 Alcohols induce death through nervous system and respiratory de - pression, resulting in anesthesia and anoxia. Alcohols have been used as secondary euthanasia methods for some fish species185 and as primary injectable euthanasia agents in laboratory mice 35 days of age or older.186 Intraperitoneal injection of ethanol has been used for the euthanasia of laboratory mice ( Mus musculus ) and rats ( Rattus norvegicus ).187 Mice re - ceiving IP injections of 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol devel - oped gradual loss of muscle control, coma, and death within 2 to 6 minutes. However, mice < 35 days of age experienced prolonged time to death following IP ethanol administration, so this method is not ap - propriate in mice in this age group or for neonatal mice ( M musculus ).188 This method is not appropri - ate for euthanasia of rats due to volume of ethanol required and prolonged time to respiratory effects.187 Tribromoethanol is used as an anesthetic agent in laboratory rodents. Advantages \u2014(1) Alcohol is inexpensive and readily available. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Alcohols produce dose-re - lated irritation to tissue. (2) Onset of insensibility and death can be delayed following alcohol administra - tion. (3) The volume required to euthanize animals larger than mice renders most alcohols impractical as euthanasia agents. (4) Alcohols are not FDA approved as euthanasia agents. (5) Tribromoethanol is not com - mercially available as a pharmaceutical-grade prod - uct and must be compounded. General recommendations\u2014 Ethanol in low concentrations is an acceptable secondary means of euthanasia in fish rendered insensible by other means and as a primary or secondary means of euthanasia of some invertebrates. Immersion in high concentra - tions (eg, 70%) of ethanol is not acceptable. Ethanol is acceptable with conditions as an agent of euthanasia for mice 35 days of age and older, but is unacceptable as an agent of euthanasia for larger species. Tribromo - ethanol is acceptable with conditions as a method for euthanasia of laboratory rodents when approved by the IACUC and prepared, stored, and administered at the appropriate dosage. M2.12 MS 222 (TMS) Tricaine methanesulfonate, commonly referred to as MS 222, is an anesthetic agent that is FDA ap -proved for temporary immobilization of fish, amphib aquatic, cold-blooded animals.189 Tric- aine methanesulfonate has been used for euthanasia of reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Tricaine is a benzoic acid derivative and, in water of low alkalinity ( < 50 mg/L as CaCO3), the solution should be buffered with sodium bicarbonate.190 A 10 g/L stock solution can be made, and sodium bicarbonate added to saturation, resulting in a pH between 7.0 and 7.5 for the solution. The stock solution should be protected from light and refrigerated or frozen if possible. The solution should be replaced monthly and any time a brown color is observed.191 Potency is increased in warm water and decreased in cold water.190 Immersion of fish in solu - tions of MS 222 for 30 minutes following loss of rhyth - mic opercular movement is sufficient for euthanasia of most fish. Due to species differences in response to MS 222, a secondary method of euthanasia is rec - ommended in many fish to ensure death.190,192 In the United States, there is a 21-day withdrawal time for MS 222; therefore, it is not appropriate for euthanasia of animals intended for consumption. MS 222 rapidly enters the CNS and alters nerve conduction through blockade of voltage-sensitive so - dium channels.192 Additionally, accumulation within ventricular myocardium results in decreased cardio - vascular function. Death is due to decreased nervous and cardiovascular function. Studies193 with Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog or platanna) have shown that the concentrations of MS 222 traditionally used for amphibian euthanasia (0.25 to 0.5 g/L) are not sufficient to induce reliable eu - thanasia in this species. Immersion of frogs in 5 g/L of MS 222 resulted in deep anesthesia within 4 minutes, but at least 1 hour of immersion at this concentration was required to reliably euthanize 100% of frogs. The authors of that study recommended that if a concentra - tion of MS 222 < 5 g/L or a shorter time frame than 1 hour is allowed, a secondary euthanasia method should be used for X laevis. Intracoelomic injection of MS 222 at the highest possible dosage (2,590 mg/ kg [1,177 mg/lb]) did not result in euthanasia, with 6 of 20 frogs regaining mobility within 3 hours after in - jections. Consequently, intracoelomic injection of MS 222 is not considered to be an acceptable method of euthanasia for X laevis and possibly other amphibians. A 2-stage euthanasia method for reptiles using MS 222 has been described.172 The first stage entails intracoelomic injection of 250 to 500 mg/kg (113.6 to 227.3 mg/lb) of a pH-neutralized solution (0.7% to 1.0% MS 222), which results in rapid loss of con - sciousness ( < 30 seconds to 4 minutes). Once uncon - sciousness occurs, a second intracoelomic injection of unbuffered 50% MS 222 is administered. Advantages \u2014(1) Tricaine methanesulfonate is soluble in both fresh and salt water and can be used for a wide variety of fish, amphibians, and reptiles. (2) Tricaine methanesulfonate is commercially available and is not a controlled substance, which increases ease of acquisition, storage, and administration.38 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONDisadvantages \u2014(1) Tricaine methanesulfonate is expensive and may be cost prohibitive for use for large fish, amphibians, and reptiles or for large pop - ulations. (2) There appears to be substantial species variability in response to MS 222, with some species requiring higher doses or secondary measures to en - sure death. (3) Injection of MS 222 is not appropri - ate for fish as rapid excretion via the gills renders it ineffective by this route.190 (4) Tricaine methane - sulfonate cannot be used in animals intended for human consumption. (5) Occupational exposure to MS 222 has been associated with retinal toxicity in humans.194 (6) Tricaine methanesulfonate is not FDA approved for use as an agent of euthanasia. (7) The impact of MS 222 residues in euthanized fish on the environment or scavenger species has not been de - termined. General recommendations\u2014 Tricaine methane - sulfonate is an acceptable method of euthanasia for fish and for some amphibians and reptiles. When used for some fish and some amphibians (eg, Xeno - pus spp), a secondary method should be used to en - sure death. By itself, intracoelomic injection of MS 222 is not an acceptable euthanasia method for X laevis and possibly other amphibians. Animals eutha - nized with MS 222 should not be used as food sources for humans or other animals. M2.13 BENZOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE Benzocaine base, a compound similar to MS 222, is not water soluble and therefore is prepared as a stock solution (100 g/L) with acetone or ethanol; the presence of these solvents can be irritating to tissues. Conversely, benzocaine hydrochloride is water solu - ble and can be used directly for either anesthesia or euthanasia of fish and amphibians.172,191 Benzocaine- containing products should be protected from light and protected from freezing or excessive heat ( > 40\u00b0C). Topical application of 7.5% or 20% benzocaine gel on an amphibian's ventrum is ef - fective and does not require buffering. Similarly to MS 222, benzocaine acts through blockade of voltage- sensitive sodium channels within the CNS and heart, resulting in depression of the nervous and cardiovas - cular systems. The application of benzocaine hydrochloride gel to the ventral abdomen of amphibians (20% concen - tration; 2.0-cm X 1.0-mm application) is an effective means of anesthesia and euthanasia for some spe - cies.193,195,196 Following application of the gel to the ventrum of X laevis and placement in a wet bucket, righting and withdrawal reflexes subsided within 7 minutes, and death occurred within 5 hours.193 No evidence of dermal injury, loss of dermal hydration, or difficulty breathing was associated with topical ap - plication of benzocaine hydrochloride gel to amphib - ians. A recent investigation on euthanasia of adult X laevis describes a dose of 182 mg/kg (82.7 mg/ lb) of benzocaine hydrochloride gel benzocaine hydrochloride applica - erebi ) indicated that, for certain warm water fish species, an ice-slurry elicits less mo - tor response than benzocaine overdose as a method of euthanasia, but additional work is needed to deter - mine the most humane method.197 Advantages \u2014(1) Benzocaine hydrochloride is a relatively fast-acting and effective euthanasia agent for fish and amphibians. (2) Benzocaine hydrochlo - ride is not a controlled substance. (3) Benzocaine hy - drochloride has low toxicity for humans at concentra - tions used to euthanize fish. (4) Benzocaine hydro - chloride poses little environmental risk as it is readily filtered by use of activated carbon and breaks down in water within approximately 4 hours. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Benzocaine hydrochloride is not FDA approved for use as an agent of euthanasia. (2) Benzocaine hydrochloride may be cost prohibi - tive for euthanasia of larger fish, amphibians, and rep - tiles or large populations. (3) Benzocaine hydrochlo - ride solutions must be carefully buffered to avoid tis - sue irritation. (4) The impact of benzocaine residues in euthanized fish on the environment or scavenger species has not been determined. General recommendations\u2014 Benzocaine hydro - chloride gel and solutions are acceptable agents for euthanasia for fish and amphibians. Benzocaine hy - drochloride is not an acceptable euthanasia agent for animals intended for consumption. M2.14 EUGENOL Cloves contain a number of essential Eu- genol comprises 85% to 95% of the essential oils in cloves, and has been used as a food flavoring and a local anesthetic for human dentistry. Eugenol is clas - sified as a \"generally regarded as safe\" food additive by the FDA and as an exempted least-toxic pesticide active ingredient by the US EPA. Eugenol exhibits antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticon - vulsant activity. Some other components of clove oil, such as isoeugenol, are equivocal carcinogens based on studies in rodents.199 Clove oil and its extracts have become popular as anesthetic agents for fresh - water and marine fish because of their wide avail - ability, low cost, and shorter induction times when compared with MS 222.200,201 When compared with MS 222 as an anesthetic agent, eugenol was found to have a more rapid induction, prolonged recovery, and narrow margin of safety, as it can cause rapid onset of ventilatory failure at high concentrations ( > 400 mg/L).202 The anesthetic mechanism of clove oil and its de - rivatives has been poorly studied, but they appear to act similarly to other local anesthetics by inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels within the ner - vous system.175 Studies203-205 of rodents indicate this class of agents may cause paralysis in addition to their anesthetic effects. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 39Advantages \u2014(1) Clove oil and its derivatives are widely available, are relatively inexpensive, and are not controlled substances. (2) These agents have a short induction time. (3) Clove oil and its derivatives are effective at a wide range of water temperatures. (4) Eugenol has low risk for human toxicity at concen - trations used for euthanasia of fish. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Clove oil and its derivatives are not FDA approved for use as an agent of euthana - sia. (2) Animals euthanized with clove oil products are not approved for human consumption. (3) Some clove oil derivatives are potential carcinogens. (4) The impact of clove oil residues in euthanized fish on the environment or scavenger species has not been determined. General recommendations\u2014 Clove oil, isoeuge - nol, and eugenol are acceptable agents of euthanasia for fish. It is recommended that, whenever possible, products with standardized, known concentrations of essential oils be used so that accurate dosing can occur. These agents are not acceptable means of eu - thanasia for animals intended for consumption. M2.15 2-PHENOXYETHANOL Immersion in 2-phenoxyethanol has been used for anesthesia and euthanasia of fish at concentra - tions of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/L or higher.200 The solubility of 2-phenoxyethanol is reduced in colder water. The mechanism of action of 2-phenoxyethanol is poorly understood, but death is thought to occur from hy - poxia secondary to CNS depression. Fish should be kept in the 2-phenoxyethanol solution for at least 10 minutes after cessation of opercular movement. Advantages \u2014(1) 2-phenoxyethanol can be used in a 1-step immersion method for euthanasia of fish. (2) 2-phenoxyethanol is not a controlled substance. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Induction times can be pro - longed. (2) There are species variations in dosage lev - els and duration of exposure required for euthanasia. (3) Some species exhibit hyperactivity prior to loss of consciousness. (4) 2-phenoxyethanol is not FDA approved for use as an agent of euthanasia. (5) The impact of 2-phenoxyethanol residues in euthanized fish on the environment or scavenger species has not been determined. General recommendations\u2014 Although there are probably more efficient immersion agents avail - able, 2-phenoxyethanol is an acceptable method of euthanasia for fish under certain circumstances. 2-phenoxyethanol is not an acceptable means of eu - thanasia in animals intended for consumption. M2.16 QUINALDINE (2-METHYLQUINOLINE, QUINALIDINE SULFATE) Quinaldine has low solubility in water and there - fore must first be dissolved in acetone or alcohol and then buffered with bicarbonate.200 The potency of quinaldine varies with species, water temperature, water pH, and mineral content of water. Quinaldine acts through depression of sensory centers of the CNS. Advantages \u2014(1) Quinaldine can be used in a 1-step immersion method for euthanasia of fish. (2) Quinaldine is not a controlled substance. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Quinaldine is not FDA ap - proved for use as an agent of euthanasia. (2) The impact of quinaldine residues in euthanized fish on the environment or scavenger species has not been determined. General recommendations\u2014 Quinaldine is an acceptable method of euthanasia for fish under cer - tain circumstances. Quinaldine is not an acceptable means of euthanasia in animals intended for con - sumption. M2.17 METOMIDATE Metomidate is a highly water-soluble, nonbarbi - turate hypnotic that acts by causing CNS depression. It is a rapidly acting euthanasia compound when used at 10 times the upper limit of the recommended anes - thetic dose. Some species of fish require higher con - centrations of metomidate to achieve anesthesia.206 Fish should be kept in the solution for at least 10 minutes following cessation of opercular movement. Metomidate is not an acceptable means of eutha - nasia in animals intended for human consumption. Metomidate is currently listed as a fish sedative and anesthetic in the FDA Index of Legally Marketed Un - approved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species,207 which prohibits any off-label use of metomidate. Advantages \u2014(1) Metomidate can be utilized in a 1-step immersion method for euthanasia of fish. (2) Metomidate is not a controlled substance. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Extralabel use of metomi - date for euthanasia is prohibited due to its status as an FDA-indexed drug. (2) Some species of fish require higher concentrations of metomidate for anesthesia, making metomidate a poor choice for euthanasia agent for those species. (3) Fish euthanized using metomidate are not acceptable for consumption. (4) The impact of metomidate residues in euthanized fish on the environment or scavenger species has not been determined. General recommendations \u2014Should its regu - latory status change to allow its use for euthanasia, metomidate is an acceptable method for euthanasia of some species of fish under certain circumstances. Metomidate is not an acceptable means of euthanasia in animals intended for consumption. M2.18 SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and solutions made from calcium hypochlorite granules act as solvents and oxidants in tissue, resulting in saponi - fication of fatty acids, denaturation of proteins, and derangement of cellular processes.208 Hypochlorite has been used to euthanize unhatched and hatched zebrafish up to 7 days after fertilization, after which time hatchlings are considered developed beyond an 40 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONembryonic form and capable of experiencing distress or pain.209 Hypochlorite has also been used to termi - nate embryos in various research settings. Advantages \u2014(1) Sodium hypochlorite and cal - cium hypochlorite are inexpensive, are readily avail - able, and, at the concentrations used for embryonic and larval stage destruction (1% to 10%), pose mini - mal hazards to personnel. (2) These products are not controlled substances. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Concentrated hypochlorite solutions are corrosive and pose risk of dermal, ocu - lar, and respiratory injury to personnel if mishandled. General recommendations \u2014When used on ear - ly embryonic and larval stages prior to development of nociceptive abilities, application of hypochlorites is an acceptable means of euthanasia. Hypochlorites are unacceptable as the sole means of euthanasia of organisms beyond these embryonic and larval stages. M2.19 FORMALDEHYDE Formaldehyde causes cellular damage through oxidative injury as well as through formation of cross- linkages with DNA, RNA, and proteins.210 Formalde - hyde can be used to euthanize and preserve Porifera (sponges) as these invertebrates lack nervous tissue. Advantages \u2014(1) Formaldehyde is inexpensive, easily obtainable, and not a controlled substance. (2) Formaldehyde rapidly fixes tissues, preserving struc - ture for later study. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Formaldehyde poses sub - stantial health risks for personnel, including respira - tory, dermal, and ocular irritation and hypersensitiv - ity. Formaldehyde is also a known human carcino - gen.211 General recommendations \u2014Formaldehyde is an acceptable method of euthanasia for Porifera spe - cies. Formaldehyde is acceptable as an adjunctive method of euthanasia for Coelenterates (comb jellies, corals, anemones) and Gastropod molluscs (snails, slugs) only after these animals have been rendered nonresponsive by other methods (eg, magnesium chloride212). Formaldehyde is unacceptable as a first step or adjunctive method of euthanasia for other ani - mal species. M2.20 LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE Lidocaine hydrochloride is a local anesthetic that acts on ion channels of nerves, blocking the move - ment of sodium into the cell and resulting in failure of nerve conduction due to inability to generate action potentials.213 Additional alteration of nerve transmis - sion occurs due to lidocaine-induced inhibition of G- protein-coupled receptors and N-methyl- d-aspartate receptors.214 Local anesthetics have occasionally been incorporated into IV barbiturate- or embutra - mide-based euthanasia solutions, primarily for their cardiodepressant effects. Advantages \u2014(1) Lidocaine is inexpensive, wide - ly available, and not a controlled substance. (2) Lido - caine causes relatively rapid loss of cerebrocortical function (brain death) when administered intrathe - cally to anesthetized animals. (3) Lidocaine leaves relatively low tissue residues and is not expected to pose hazards to scavenging animals that might feed on the carcass.214 Disadvantages \u2014(1) Anesthesia and intrathecal administration require technical expertise to per - form. (2) Risk to scavenging animals from anesthetic drug residues must be considered. (3) Reflexive (ag - onal) breathing occurred occasionally after loss of brain electrical activity. (4) Exposure of personnel to encephalitic diseases (eg, rabies) from CSF removed from animals with unknown illness is possible. Recommendations \u2014Intrathecal 2% lidocaine hydrochloride is an acceptable secondary method of euthanasia in animals under anesthesia in situations where other euthanasia methods are unavailable or cost prohibitive or where proper carcass disposal cannot be assured. M2.21 UNACCEPTABLE AGENTS Strychnine, nicotine, insulin, caffeine, cleaning agents, solvents, pesticides, disinfectants, and other toxicants not specifically designed for therapeutic or euthanasia use are unacceptable for use as euthanasia agents under any circumstances. Magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, and neu - romuscular blocking agents are unacceptable for use as euthanasia agents in conscious vertebrate animals. These agents may be used for euthanasia of anesthe - tized or unconscious animals as previously described. M3 Physical Methods M3.1 COMMON CONSIDERATIONS Physical methods of euthanasia include captive bolt, gunshot, cervical dislocation, decapitation, electrocution, focused beam microwave irradiation, exsanguination, maceration, stunning, and pithing. When properly used by skilled personnel with well- maintained equipment, physical methods of euthana - sia may result in less fear and anxiety and be more rapid, painless, humane, and practical than other forms of euthanasia. Exsanguination, stunning, and pithing are not recommended as a sole means of eu - thanasia, but may be considered as adjuncts to other agents or methods. Some consider physical methods of euthanasia aes - thetically displeasing. There are occasions, however, when what is perceived as aesthetic and what is most humane are in conflict. Despite their aesthetic chal - lenges, in certain situations physical methods may be the most appropriate choice for euthanasia and rapid relief of pain and suffering. Personnel using physical methods of euthanasia must be well trained and moni - tored for each type of physical method performed to ensure euthanasia is conducted appropriately. They must also be sensitive to the aesthetic implications of the method and convey to onlookers what they should expect to observe when at all possible. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 41Since most physical methods involve trauma, there is inherent risk for animals and people. If the method is not performed correctly, personnel may be injured or the animal may not be effectively eutha - nized; personnel skill and experience are essential. Inexperienced persons should be trained by expe - rienced persons and should practice on euthanized animals or anesthetized animals to be euthanized until they are proficient in performing the method properly and humanely. After the method has been applied, death must be confirmed before disposal of the remains. M3.2 PCB Penetrating captive bolts have been used for eu - thanasia of ruminants, horses, swine, laboratory rab - bits, dogs, and alpacas.215,216 Standard captive bolts may be inadequate for euthanizing water buffalo.217 Their mode of action is concussion and trauma to the cerebral hemisphere and brainstem. More recent re - search218 in cattle indicates that changing the location of the shot to be a slightly higher location increases the probability of brainstem disruption. Adequate restraint is important to ensure proper placement of captive bolts. A cerebral hemisphere and the brain - stem must be sufficiently disrupted by the projectile to induce sudden loss of consciousness and subse - quent death. Young steers and heifers were success - fully rendered unconscious without disruption of the brainstem with a high-powered, pneumatic PCB.219 Appropriate placement of captive bolts for vari - ous species has been described.220-224 Signs of effec - tive captive bolt penetration and death are immedi - ate collapse and a several-second period of tetanic spasm, followed by slow hind limb movements of in - creasing frequency.225,226 The corneal reflex must be absent and the eyes must open into a wide blank stare and not be rotated.227 There are 2 types of PCBs: a regular PCB and an air injection PCB. In both cases, the bolts penetrate the brain. In the air injection PCB, air under high pressure is injected through the bolt into the brain to increase the extent of tissue destruction. Powder- activated guns that use the traditional captive bolt are available in 9 mm, .22 caliber, and .25 caliber.220 Cap- tive bolt guns powered by compressed air (pneumat - ic) are also available in regular and air injection types. All captive bolt guns require careful maintenance and cleaning after each day of use. Lack of maintenance is a major cause of captive bolt gun failure for both powder-activated and pneumatic captive bolt guns.228 Repeated firing of a captive bolt for extended periods may reduce effectiveness.229 This is due to the gun becoming overheated. Advantages \u2014(1) Both regular and air injection PCBs may be used effectively for euthanasia of ani - mals in research facilities and on the farm, when the use of drugs for this purpose is inappropriate or im - practical. (2) They do not chemically contaminate tis - sues.Disadvantages \u2014(1) Euthanasia by captive bolt can be aesthetically displeasing. (2) Death may not occur if equipment is not maintained and used prop - erly. (3) The air injection captive bolt must never be used on ruminants that will be used for food because of concerns about contamination of meat with speci - fied risk materials (neurologic tissue). (4) Because the PCB is destructive, brain tissue may not be able to be examined for evidence of rabies infection or chronic wasting disease. Leg-paddling motions that occur af - ter an animal is shot with a captive bolt are spinal re - flexes that occur in completely unconscious animals after the spinal cord has been severed at the base of the skull.230,231 General recommendations \u2014Use of the PCB is acceptable with conditions and is a practical method of euthanasia for horses, ruminants, swine, rabbits, and poultry. To ensure death, it is recommended that animals be immediately exsanguinated or pithed (see adjunctive methods) unless a powerful captive bolt gun designed for euthanasia is used. These guns have recently become available and reduce the need to ap - ply an adjunctive method. Ruminants used for food should not be pithed to avoid contamination of the carcass with specified risk materials. Captive bolt guns used for larger species must have an extended bolt. M3.3 NPCB Research has shown that NPCBs are less effec - tive on cattle than PCBs.232,233 The NPCB has a wide, mushroom-shaped head that does not penetrate the brain of large mammals, such as adult cattle, slaugh - ter-weight pigs, sows, and adult sheep. In general, NPCB guns only stun animals and should not be used as a sole method of euthanasia. Correct positioning is critical for an effective stun of an adult cow. Nonpen - etrating captive bolts are not effective for stunning bulls, adult swine, or cattle with long hair. Purpose-built or powder-activated pneumatic NPCB guns have recently been developed and suc - cessfully used for euthanasia of suckling pigs up to 9 kg (20 lb).234 Advantage\u2014 Less damage to the brain. Disadvantages\u2014 (1) Nonpenetrating captive bolt guns only stun animals and therefore are gener - ally not effective as a sole means of euthanasia. The exception is nonpenetrating pneumatic captive bolt guns that have been purpose-built for euthanasia of suckling pigs,b neonatal ruminants,220 and turkeys.235 (2) Depending on degree of destruction, use of an NPCB may preclude postmortem diagnostics for dis - eases of the brain, including rabies and chronic wast - ing disease. General recommendations \u2014In general, NPCB guns should not be used as a sole method of eutha - nasia. However, pneumatic purpose-built NPCB neonatal ruminants,220 and EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONM3.4 MANUALLY APPLIED BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD Euthanasia by manually applied blunt force trau - ma to the head must be evaluated in terms of the ana - tomic features of the species on which it is to be per - formed, the skill of those performing it, the number of animals to be euthanized, and the environment in which it is to be conducted. Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head can be a humane method of euthanasia for neonatal animals with thin craniums if a single sharp blow delivered to the central skull bones with sufficient force can produce immediate depression of the CNS and destruction of brain tissue. When properly performed, loss of consciousness is rapid. Personnel performing manually applied blunt force trauma to the head must be properly trained and monitored for proficiency with this method of euthanasia, and they must be aware of its aesthetic implications. Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head has been used primarily to euthanize small labora - tory animals with thin craniums.223,237,238 It has also been applied for euthanasia of young piglets. The ana - tomic features of neonatal calves make manually ap - plied blunt force trauma to the head unacceptable as a method of euthanasia for this species. Personnel who have to perform manually applied blunt force trauma to the head often find it displeas - ing and soon become fatigued. Fatigue can lead to inconsistency in application, creating humane con - cerns about its efficacious application to large num - bers of animals. For this reason, the AVMA encour - ages those using manually applied blunt force trauma to the head as a euthanasia method to actively search for alternate approaches. Advantages\u2014 (1) Blunt force trauma applied manually to the head is inexpensive and effective when performed correctly. (2) Blunt force trauma does not chemically contaminate tissues. Disadvantages\u2014 (1) Manually applied blunt force trauma is displeasing for personnel who have to perform it. (2) Repeatedly performing manually applied blunt force trauma can result in personnel fatigue, loss of efficacy, and humane concerns. (3) Trauma to the cranium can damage tissues and inter - fere with diagnosis of brain diseases. General recommendations\u2014 Replace, as much as possible, manually applied blunt force trauma to the head with alternate methods. Manually applied blunt force trauma is not acceptable for neonatal calves, because of their anatomic features. M3.5 GUNSHOT A properly placed gunshot can cause immediate insensibility and a humane death. Under some condi - tions, a gunshot may be the only practical method of euthanasia. Shooting should only be performed by highly skilled personnel trained in the use of firearms and only in jurisdictions that allow for legal firearm use. The safety of personnel, the public, and other animals that are nearby should be considered. The procedure should be performed outdoors and in ar - eas where public access is restricted. In applying gunshot to the head as a method of euthanasia for captive animals, the firearm should be aimed so that the projectile enters the brain, caus - ing instant loss of consciousness.33,224,239-242 This must take into account differences in brain position and skull conformation between species, as well as the energy requirement for penetration of the skull and sinus.221,240 Accurate targeting for a gunshot to the head in various species has been described.240,241,243 For wildlife and other freely roaming animals, the preferred target area should be the head. It may, however, not be possible or appropriate to target the head when killing is attempted from large distances (missed shots may result in jaw fractures or other nonfatal injuries) or when diagnostic samples of brain tissue are needed for diagnosis of diseases (eg, rabies, chronic wasting disease) important to public health. The appropriate firearm should be selected for the situation, with the goal being penetration and destruction of brain tissue without emergence from the contralateral side of the head.220,244 A gunshot to the heart or neck does not immediately render ani - mals unconscious, but may be required when it is not possible to meet the POE's definition of euthanasia.245 M3.5.1 BAsIC pRInCIples of fIReARms To determine whether a firearm or type of ammu - nition is appropriate for euthanizing animals, some basic principles must be understood. The kinetic en - ergy of an object increases as the speed and weight or mass of the object increase. In reference to firearms, the bullet's kinetic energy (muzzle energy) is the en - ergy of a bullet as it leaves the end of the barrel when the firearm is discharged. Muzzle energy is frequently used as an indicator of a bullet's destructive potential. The heavier the bullet and the greater its velocity, the higher its muzzle energy and capacity for destruction of objects in its path. Muzzle energy (E) can be expressed as the mass of the bullet (M) times its velocity (V) squared, divid - ed by 2.246 However, to accommodate units of mea - sure commonly used in the United States for civilian firearms, energy (E) is expressed in foot-pounds. This is calculated by multiplying the bullet's weight (W) times its velocity in feet per second (V) squared and dividing the result by 450,450. The International Sys - tem of Units expresses muzzle energy in joules (J). The muzzle energy of commercially available am - munition varies greatly. For example, the difference in muzzle energy generated from a .357 Magnum handgun loaded with a 180 grain compared with a 110 grain bullet may differ by as much as 180 foot- pounds.246 Velocity has an even greater impact on bullet energy than bullet mass. Selection of an ap - propriate bullet and firearm is critical to good per - formance when conducting euthanasia procedures. Lighter-weight, higher-velocity bullets can have high AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 43muzzle energy, but decreased penetration, which can be an issue when penetrating thick bones. Whereas most euthanasia using firearms is con - ducted at close range, calculations of muzzle energy are useful for determining which firearms are appro - priate for euthanasia of animals of varying sizes. As the bullet travels beyond the muzzle of the firearm its energy gradually begins to decrease. While this is not a concern for the use of firearms in close proxim - ity to the animal, when attempting to euthanize an animal from a distance, to ensure accuracy and that an acceptable level of muzzle energy is achieved, a high-powered rifle may be the better choice for con - ducting euthanasia. In all cases, the most important factors in ensuring successful euthanasia are the ex - perience and skill of the shooter. M3.5.2 muzzle eneRgy Requ IRements For euthanasia, the combination of firearm and ammunition247 selected must achieve a muzzle ener - gy of at least 300 feet-lb (407 J) for animals weighing up to 400 lb (180 kg). For animals larger than 400 lb, 1,000 feet-lb (1,356 J) is required.220 Handguns do not typically achieve the muzzle energy required to euthanize animals weighing more than 400 lb (180 kg), and therefore rifles must be used to euthanize these animals. Some would argue that the muzzle energies rec - ommended are well beyond what is necessary to achieve satisfactory results. Anecdotal comment sug - gests that the .22 LR is one of the most frequently used firearms for euthanasia of livestock with vary - ing degrees of success. There is little doubt that suc - cess or failure is partially related to firearm and bullet characteristics, but probably more so to selection of the ideal anatomic site (ie, a site more likely to affect the brainstem) for conducting the procedure. The Humane Slaughter Association lists multiple firearms for euthanasia of livestock, including shotguns (12, 16, 20, 28, and .410 gauges), handguns (.32 to .45 cali - ber), and rifles (.22, .243, .270, and .308). In general, when comparing handguns with rifles, the longer the barrel, the higher the muzzle velocity. Therefore, if a .22 is used for euthanasia it is best fired from a rifle. The .22 should never be used on aged bulls, boars, or rams.248 M3.5.3 Bullet seleCtIon While much of the emphasis in euthanasia by gunshot is placed on choice of the most appropriate firearm, it should be remembered that the gun is only the means of delivery. Bullet selection is quite pos - sibly the most important consideration for euthana - sia of livestock by gunshot. There are 3 basic types of bullets pertinent to this discussion: solid points, hollow points, and full metal jacket bullets. Solid- point bullets are preferred for euthanasia since they are designed for greater penetration of their targets. Under ideal conditions this type of bullet will also undergo moderate expansion to a mushroom shape that increases its destructive characteristics. Hollow- point bullets are designed with a hollowed-out tip that causes rapid expansion and fragmentation of the bullet on impact. The hollow-point design allows maximum transfer of energy without risk of overpen - etration. For applications where it may be desirable to control or reduce the degree of bullet penetration, hollow-point bullets are preferred. However, for the purposes of euthanasia of livestock the first require - ment is that the bullet possesses sufficient energy to penetrate the skull and enter the underlying brain tis - sue. The concern with hollow-point bullets is that, since the majority of their energy is released on im - pact through fragmentation, they may not have suffi - cient energy to traverse the skull. The other extreme is represented by full metal jacket bullets, which do not expand or fragment on impact with their targets. These bullets have a lead core with a thin metal jacket cover that completely covers (surrounds) the bullet. Full metal jacket bullets generally achieve maximum penetration, which may have benefits for euthanasia but also creates additional safety hazards for bystand - ers. Shotguns loaded with shot shells (number 4, 5, or 6) have sufficient energy to traverse the skull but, unlike the possibility of bullets from either a hand - gun or rifle, rarely exit the skull. These are important considerations when selecting a firearm for on-farm euthanasia. Probably the most important point to be made relative to the use of gunshot for euthanasia is that scientific information on firearm and bullet se - lection is lacking. This is an area of urgent need in euthanasia research. M3.5.4 fIReARm sAfety Firearm safety cannot be overemphasized. Guns are inherently dangerous and must be handled with caution at all times. This needs to become the mind - set in handling and use of firearms. Common recom - mendations include the following: 1) assume that all firearms are loaded, 2) always know where the muz - zle is and never allow it to point in the direction of oneself or bystanders, 3) keep fingers away from the trigger and out of the trigger guard until ready to fire, 4) be sure of the target and what lies beyond it, and 5) always be sure that the gun is unloaded when not in use. Readers desiring more information or training on proper use of firearms are advised to contact local hunter safety programs. These programs offer train - ing in firearm safety and also provide information on rules and regulations for firearm use. Firearms should never be held flush to an animal's body. The pressure within the barrel when fired may cause the barrel of the gun to explode, placing the shooter and observers at great risk of injury. Ideally, the muzzle of the firearm should be held within 1 to 2 feet of the animal's forehead and perpendicular to the skull with the intended path of the bullet roughly in the direction of the foramen magnum. This will reduce the potential for ricochet while directing the bullet toward the cerebrum, midbrain, and medulla 44 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONoblongata, which will assure immediate loss of con - sciousness and rapid death. Advantages \u2014(1) Loss of consciousness is instan - taneous if the projectile destroys most of the brain. (2) Given the need to minimize stress induced by handling and human contact, gunshot may be the most practical and logical method of euthanasia for wild or free-ranging species. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Gunshot may be dangerous for personnel. (2) It is aesthetically unpleasant for many. (3) Under field conditions, it may be difficult to hit the vital target area. (4) Brain tissue may not be able to be examined for evidence of brain diseases (eg, rabies infection, chronic wasting disease) when the head is targeted. (5) Skill in application of fire - arms and species-specific knowledge of appropriate target sites are required. In some states, firearm use is not permitted if the operator has been convicted of a felony. General recommendations \u2014When other meth - ods cannot be used, an accurately delivered gunshot is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia.241,249 When an animal can be appropriately restrained, the PCB, preferably one designed for euthanasia, is pre - ferred to a gunshot because it is safer for personnel. Prior to shooting, animals accustomed to the pres - ence of humans should be treated in a calm and reas - suring manner to minimize anxiety. In the case of wild animals, gunshots should be delivered with the least amount of prior human contact necessary. Gun - shot should not be used for routine euthanasia of ani - mals in animal control situations, such as municipal pounds or shelters. M3.6 CERVICAL DISLOCATION Cervical dislocation has been used for many years for euthanasia and, when performed by well- trained individuals on appropriate animals, appears to be humane. However, there are few scientific stud - ies available to confirm this observation. The method has been used to euthanize small birds, poultry, mice, immature rats ( < 200 g [7.1 oz]), and rabbits. For mice and rats, the thumb and index finger are placed on either side of the neck at the base of the skull or, alter - natively, a rod is pressed at the base of the skull. With the other hand, the base of the tail or the hind limbs are quickly pulled, causing separation of the cervi - cal vertebrae from the skull. For immature rabbits, the head is held in one hand and the hind limbs in the other. The animal is stretched and the neck is hy - perextended and dorsally twisted to separate the first cervical vertebra from the skull.223,250 For poultry and other birds, the legs of the bird should be grasped (or wings if grasped at the base) and the neck stretched by pulling on the head while applying a ventrodorsal rotational force to the skull. Crushing of cervical ver - tebrae and spinal cord is not acceptable unless the bird is first rendered unconscious. Personnel should be trained on anesthetized and/or dead animals to demonstrate proficiency.Data suggest that electrical activity in the brain persists for 13 seconds following cervical dislocation in rats,251 and unlike decapitation, rapid exsanguina - tion does not contribute to loss of consciousness.252,253 For some classes of poultry there is evidence that cervical dislocation may not cause immediate uncon - sciousness.235,236,254,255 Advantages \u2014(1) Cervical dislocation is a meth - od that may induce rapid loss of consciousness.150,251 (2) It does not chemically contaminate tissue. (3) It is rapidly accomplished. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Cervical dislocation may be aesthetically displeasing to personnel perform - ing or observing the method. (2) Cervical dislocation requires mastering technical skills to ensure loss of consciousness is rapidly induced. (3) Its use for eu - thanasia is limited to small birds, poultry, mice, im - mature rats ( < 200 g), and rabbits. General recommendations \u2014Manual cervical dislocation is acceptable with conditions for euthana - sia of small birds, poultry, mice, rats weighing < 200 g, and rabbits when performed by individuals with a demonstrated high degree of technical proficiency. In lieu of demonstrated technical competency, animals must be unconscious or anesthetized prior to cervical dislocation. For heavy rats and rabbits, the large mus - cle mass in the cervical region makes manual cervical dislocation physically more difficult.256 When per - formed on poultry, cervical dislocation must result in luxation of the cervical vertebrae without primary crushing of the vertebrae and spinal cord. In some classes of poultry, there is evidence that cervical dislocation may not cause immediate unconscious - ness.235,236,254,255 In these cases, other physical meth - ods such as blunt force trauma or decapitation may be more humane257 and should be employed when available or practicable. Those responsible for the use of this method must ensure that personnel performing cervical dis - location have been properly trained and consistently apply it humanely and effectively. M3.7 DECAPITATION Decapitation can be used to euthanize rodents and small rabbits in research settings. It provides a means to recover tissues and body fluids that are chemically uncontaminated. It also provides a means of obtaining anatomically undamaged brain tissue for study.258 Although it has been demonstrated that electri - cal activity in the brain persists for 13 to 14 seconds following decapitation,259 more recent studies and re - ports251-253 indicate this activity does not imply that pain is perceived, and in fact conclude that loss of consciousness develops rapidly. Visually evoked po - tentials in mice were reduced more quickly after cer - vical dislocation compared with decapitation.260 Guillotines designed to accomplish decapitation of adult rodents and small rabbits in a uniformly in - stantaneous manner are commercially available. Guil - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 45lotines are not commercially available for neonatal ro - dents, but sharp blades can be used for this purpose. Advantages \u2014(1) Decapitation appears to in - duce rapid loss of consciousness.251-254 (2) It does not chemically contaminate tissues. (3) It is rapidly ac - complished. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Handling and restraint re - quired to perform decapitation may be distressful for animals.261 (2) The interpretation of the presence of electrical activity in the brain following decapitation has created controversy, and its importance may still be open to debate.251-254,259 (3) Personnel perform - ing this method should recognize the inherent dan - ger of the guillotine and take precautions to prevent personal injury. (4) Decapitation may be aesthetically displeasing to personnel performing or observing the method. General recommendations \u2014This method is ac - ceptable with conditions if performed correctly, and it may be used in research settings when its use is required by the experimental design and approved by the IACUC. Decapitation is justified for studies where undamaged and uncontaminated brain tissue is re - quired. The equipment used to perform decapitation must be maintained in good working order and ser - viced on a regular basis to ensure sharpness of blades. The use of plastic cones to restrain animals appears to reduce distress from handling, minimizes the chance of injury to personnel, and improves position - ing of the animal. Decapitation of amphibians, fish, and reptiles is addressed elsewhere in the Guidelines. Those responsible for the use of this method must en - sure that personnel who perform decapitation have been properly trained to do so and are monitored for competence. M3.8 ELECTROCUTION Alternating current has been used to euthanize dogs, cattle, sheep, goats, swine, chickens, foxes, mink, and fish.227,239,242,262-270 Fifty- or 60-cycle elec - trical current is more effective than higher frequen - cies.271,272 Electrocution induces death by cardiac fibrillation, which causes cerebral hypoxia.269,270,273 However, animals do not lose consciousness for 10 to 30 seconds or more after onset of cardiac fibril - lation. It is imperative that animals be unconscious and insensible to pain before being electrocuted. Un - consciousness can be induced by any method that is acceptable or acceptable with conditions, including passing a current through the brain.274 Parameters for use of electricity to induce uncon - sciousness are readily available.239,275 When electric - ity is used to induce unconsciousness, a current is passed through the brain, which will induce a grand mal epileptic seizure.267,270,276,277 Signs of effective induction of the seizure are extension of the limbs, opisthotonus, downward rotation of the eyeballs, and a tonic (rigid) spasm changing to a clonic (paddling) spasm with eventual muscle flaccidity. There are 3 approaches to the use of electric -ity for euthanasia. They are head only, 1-step head to body, and 2-step head and body. To be effective for euthanasia all 3 of these methods must induce a grand mal epileptic seizure. For the head-only procedure, an electrical cur - rent is passed through the head to induce a seizure. This causes a temporary loss of consciousness of 15 to 30 seconds' duration,276-278 but does not induce cardi - ac fibrillation. For this reason, head-only application must be immediately followed by a secondary proce - dure to cause death. When the head-only procedure is applied, the grand mal seizure is easily observable. Electrically induced cardiac fibrillation, exsanguina - tion, or other appropriate adjunctive methods may be used to achieve death and should be performed within 15 seconds of when the animal becomes un - conscious. In the 1-step head-to-body approach an electri - cal current is simultaneously passed through both the brain and the heart. This simultaneously induces a grand mal seizure and electrocutes the animal by inducing cardiac arrest.263,276,279-281 Because electric - ity passes through the spinal column, clinical signs of the grand mal seizure may be masked; however, it is usually possible to see a weak tonic phase and weak clonic phase after a 3-second application. If current is applied for more than 3 seconds, tonic and clonic spasms may be blocked. The 1-step approach must be used with amperage settings that have been scientifi - cally verified to induce a seizure. Recommended am - perages are 1.25 amps for pigs, 1 amp for sheep, and 1.25 amps for cattle.238,281 Denicourt et al282 report that 110 V at 60 Hz applied for 3 seconds was effec - tive for pigs up to 125 kg (275 lb). In the 2-step method an electrical current is passed through the head to induce unconsciousness, then a second current is passed through either the side of the body or the brisket to induce cardiac ar - rest.283,284 Applying the second current by an elec - trode placed on the side of the body behind the fore - limb has been reported to be effective.283 A common cause of failure to induce uncon - sciousness is incorrect placement of the electrodes.279 Experiments with dogs revealed that electrode posi - tions where the brain is bypassed do not cause instan - taneous unconsciousness. When electricity passes only between the forelimbs and hind limbs or neck and feet, it causes the heart to fibrillate but does not induce sudden loss of consciousness.273 The animal will be electrocuted, but will remain conscious until it dies from cardiac fibrillation. Three options are available for correct electrode placement for the head-only method, including on both sides of the head between the eye and ear, the base of the ear on both sides of the head, and diago - nally below one ear and above the eye on the opposite side of the head. For the 1-step (head-to-back) meth - od, the head electrode may be placed on the forehead or immediately behind the ear. The head electrode should never be placed on the neck because the brain 46 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONwill be bypassed.285 Diagonal movement of the elec - trical current through the body can be accomplished by placing the head electrode behind one ear and the body electrode on the opposite side. When the 2-step procedure is used, placement of the body electrode behind the forelimb is effective.283 Electrodes consisting of a metal band or chain around the nose and a band or chain around the tho - rax appear to be effective for pigs weighing up to 125 kg.282 When electrical methods of euthanasia are used, the following signs of return to consciousness must be absent: rhythmic breathing, righting reflex, vocal - ization, eyeblink, and tracking of a moving object.283 Gasping and nystagmus may be present in animals that have been successfully rendered unconscious with electricity. Gasping should not be confused with rhythmic breathing, and nystagmus (a rapid vibrating or fluttering of the eye) should not be confused with eyeblink (complete closure and then complete open - ing of the eye, which occurs without touching). Advantages \u2014(1) Electrocution is humane if the animal is first rendered unconscious. (2) It does not chemically contaminate tissues. (3) It is economical. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Electrocution may be haz - ardous to personnel. (2) It is not useful for danger - ous, intractable animals that are difficult to restrain. (3) It is aesthetically objectionable because of violent extension and stiffening of the limbs, head, and neck. (4) It may not result in death in small animals ( < 5 kg [11 lb]) because ventricular fibrillation and circu - latory collapse do not always persist after cessation of current flow. (5) Sometimes it is not effective in dehydrated animals.275 (6) Personnel must be famil - iar with appropriate placement of electrodes and use of equipment. (7) Purpose-built equipment must be used. General recommendations \u2014Euthanasia by elec - trocution is acceptable with conditions. It requires special skills and equipment that will ensure passage of sufficient current through the brain to induce loss of consciousness and induce tonic and clonic epilep - tic spasms. Unconsciousness must be induced before cardiac fibrillation or simultaneously with cardiac fibrillation. Cardiac fibrillation must never occur be - fore the animal is rendered unconscious. Methods that apply electric current from head to tail, head to foot, or head to moistened metal plates on which the animal stands are unacceptable. The 2-step method should be used in situations where there may be ques - tions about sufficient current to induce a grand mal seizure with tonic and clonic spasms. This approach enables observation of tonic and clonic spasms before a second current is applied to induce cardiac arrest. Although acceptable with conditions if the aforemen - tioned requirements are met, the method's disadvan - tages outweigh its advantages in most applications. Electroimmobilization that paralyzes an animal with - out first inducing unconsciousness is extremely aver - sive and is unacceptable.274,275 For both humane and safety reasons, the use of household electrical cords is not acceptable. M3.9 KILL TRAPS Mechanical kill traps are used for the collection and killing of small, free-ranging mammals for com - mercial purposes (fur, skin, or meat), scientific pur - poses, to stop property damage, and to protect hu - man safety. Their use remains controversial and kill traps do not always render a rapid or stress-free death consistent with the criteria established for euthanasia by the POE.286 For this reason, use of live traps fol - lowed by other methods of euthanasia is preferred. There are a few situations when that is not possible (eg, pest control) or when it may actually be more stressful for the animals or dangerous for humans to use live traps. Although newer technologies are improving kill trap performance in achieving loss of consciousness quickly, individual testing is recommended to be sure the trap is working properly.287 If kill traps must be used, the most humane option available must be cho - sen,288-290 as evaluated by use of International Organi - zation for Standardization testing procedures,291 or by the methods of Gilbert,292 Proulx et al,293,294 or Hiltz and Roy.295 To reach the required level of efficacy, traps may need to be modified from manufacturers' production standards. In addition, as specified in scientific stud - ies, trap placement (ground vs tree sets), bait type, set location, selectivity apparatus, body placement modifying devices (eg, sidewings, cones), trigger sen - sitivity, and trigger type, size, and conformation are essential considerations that could affect a kill trap's ability to reach these standards. Several kill traps, modifications, and set specifics have been scientifi - cally evaluated and found to meet standards for vari - ous species.293,294,296-309,c Advantage \u2014(1) Free-ranging small mammals may be killed with minimal distress associated with handling and human contact. (2) Multiple animals may be effectively killed in situations where public health, animal behavior, or other constraints exist. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Traps may not kill within acceptable time periods. (2) Selectivity and efficien - cy is dependent on the skill and proficiency of the operator. (3) Nontarget species may be trapped and injured. General recommendations \u2014Kill traps do not consistently meet the POE's criteria for euthanasia, and may be best characterized as humane killing un - der some circumstances. At the same time, it is rec - ognized they can be practical and effective for scien - tific animal collection or pest control when used in a manner that ensures selectivity, a swift kill, and no damage to body parts needed for field research.310,311 Care must be taken to avoid trapping and injuring nontarget species. Traps need to be checked at least once daily. In those instances when an animal is wounded or cap - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 47tured but not dead, the animal must be killed quickly and humanely. Kill traps should be used only when other acceptable methods are not practical or have failed. Traps for nocturnal species should not be ac - tivated during the day to avoid capture of diurnal species.310 Trap manufacturers should strive to meet their responsibility of minimizing pain and suffering in target species. Traps that entrap a conscious ani - mal in glue or other sticky substance are not accept - able for euthanasia, but may be required for pest con - trol. Glue traps are acceptable for insects or spiders. M3.10 MACERATION Maceration, via use of a specially designed me - chanical apparatus having rotating blades or projec - tions, causes immediate fragmentation and death of poultry up to 72 hours old and embryonated eggs. A review312 of the use of commercially available mac - erators for euthanasia of chicks, poults, and pipped eggs indicates that death by maceration in poultry up to 72 hours old occurs immediately with minimal pain and distress. Maceration is an alternative to the use of CO2 for euthanasia of poultry up to 72 hours old. Maceration is believed to be equivalent to cer - vical dislocation and cranial compression as to time element, and is considered to be an acceptable means of euthanasia for newly hatched poultry by the Fed - eration of Animal Science Societies,313 Agriculture Canada,314 World Organization for Animal Health,239 and European Union.315 Advantages \u2014(1) Death is almost instantaneous. (2) The method is safe for workers. (3) Large numbers of animals can be killed quickly. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Special equipment is re - quired and it must be kept in excellent working con - dition. (2) Personnel must be trained to ensure prop - er operation of equipment. (3) Macerated tissues may present biosecurity risks. General recommendations \u2014Maceration re - quires special equipment that must be kept in excel - lent working order. Chicks must be delivered to the macerator in a way and at a rate that prevents a back - log of chicks at the point of entry into the macerator and without causing injury, suffocation, or avoidable distress to the chicks before maceration. M3.11 FOCUSED BEAM MICROWAVE IRRADIATION Heating by focused beam microwave irradiation is used primarily by neurobiologists to fix brain me - tabolites in vivo while maintaining the anatomic in - tegrity of the brain.316 Microwave instruments have been specifically designed for use in euthanasia of laboratory mice and rats. The instruments differ in design from kitchen units and may vary in maximal power output from 1.3 to 10 kW. All units direct their microwave energy to the head of the animal. The power required to rapidly halt brain enzyme activity depends on the efficiency of the unit, the ability to tune the resonant cavity, and the size of the rodent head.317 There is considerable variation among instru - ments in the time required for loss of consciousness and euthanasia. A 10-kW, 2,450-MHz instrument op - erated at a power of 9 kW will increase the brain tem - perature of 18- to 28-g (0.6- to 1.0-oz) mice to 79\u00b0C in 330 milliseconds, and the brain temperature of 250- to 420-g (8.8- to 14.8-oz) rats to 94\u00b0C in 800 mil - liseconds.318 Advantages \u2014(1) Loss of consciousness is achieved in < 100 milliseconds, and death in < 1 sec - ond. (2) This is the most effective method to fix brain tissue in vivo for subsequent assay of enzymatically labile chemicals. Disadvantages \u2014(1) Instruments are expensive. (2) Only animals the size of mice and rats can be eu - thanized with commercial instruments that are cur - rently available. General recommendations \u2014Focused beam mi - crowave irradiation is a humane method for eutha - nizing small laboratory rodents if instruments that induce rapid loss of consciousness are used. Only in - struments that are designed for this use and have ap - propriate power and microwave distribution can be used. Microwave ovens designed for domestic and in - stitutional kitchens are unacceptable for euthanasia. M3.12 THORACIC (CARDIOPULMONARY, CARDIAC) COMPRESSION Thoracic (cardiopulmonary, cardiac) compres - sion is a method that has been used by biologists to terminate the lives of wild small mammals and birds, mainly under field conditions.319 Although it has been used extensively in the field, data supporting this method are limited, including degree of distress induced and time to unconsciousness or death.320 Given our current knowledge of the physiology of both small mammals and birds, it cannot be assured that thoracic compression does not result in pain and distress before animals become unconscious. Con - sequently, thoracic compression is an unacceptable means of euthanizing animals that are not deeply anesthetized or insentient due to other reasons, but is appropriate as a secondary method for animals that are insentient. The consensus of veterinarians with field biology training and expertise is that portable equipment and alternate methods are currently available to field bi - ologists for euthanasia of wildlife under field condi - tions, in accordance with current standards for good animal welfare. Anesthetics can be administered pri - or to application of thoracic compression. Depending on taxa, open-drop methods or injectable agents that do not require DEA registration can be used. These alternate methods are generally practical to use with minimal training and preparation as standard proce - dures prior to embarking upon fieldwork.48 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE METHODS M3.13.1 exsAngu InAtIon Exsanguination can be used to ensure death sub - sequent to stunning, or in otherwise unconscious animals. Because anxiety is associated with extreme hypovolemia, exsanguination must not be used as a sole means of euthanasia.321 Animals may be exsan - guinated to obtain blood products, but only when they are sedated, stunned, or anesthetized.322 M3.13.2 pIthIng In general, pithing is used as an adjunctive proce - dure to ensure death in an animal that has been ren - dered unconscious by other means. For some species, such as frogs, with anatomic features that facilitate easy access to the CNS, pithing may be used as a sole means of euthanasia, but an anesthetic overdose is more suitable. Pithing in ruminants is performed by inserting a pithing rod or tool through the entry site produced in the skull by a PCB or free bullet.323 The operator manipulates the pithing tool to substantially destroy both brainstem and spinal cord tissue. Muscular ac - tivity during pithing can be considerable, but is fol - lowed by quiescence that facilitates exsanguination or other procedures. Pithing is sometimes used in ad - vance of exsanguination to reduce involuntary move - ment in stunned animals.324 This method should not be used in ruminants intended for food because of possible contamination of the meat with specified risk materials. Disposable pithing rods are available for pur - chase. The rod must be somewhat rigid, yet flexible, and of sufficient length to reach the brain and spinal column through the access point in the skull. M4 Footnotes a.

S1.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Companion animals for which euthanasia is de - termined to be necessary are usually encountered in 4 main environments: individually owned animals; breeding animals (from dams, sires, and single lit - ters to colonies of breeding animals); populations of animals maintained in animal control facilities, shelters and rescues, and pet shops; and animals maintained in research laboratories. Examples of less common venues in which companion animals might be euthanized include quarantine stations and Grey - hound racetracks. Aquatic companion animals are considered in Section S6, Finfish and Aquatic Inver - tebrates, of the Guidelines. As indicated previously in this document (see Section I5.5, Human Behavior), the relationships between companion animals and their owners or caretakers vary and should be care - fully considered and respected when selecting an ap - proach to euthanasia for these species. Euthanasia of companion animals is best con - ducted in quiet, familiar environments when prac - tical. The species being euthanized, the reason for euthanasia, and the availability of equipment and per - sonnel will all contribute to decisions about the most appropriate location. The professional judgment of the veterinarian conducting or providing oversight for euthanasia is paramount in making appropriate decisions about euthanasia (eg, location, agent, route of administration) in species kept as companions and in the specific environments where they are encoun - tered. Personnel conducting euthanasia must have a complete understanding of and proficiency in the eu - thanasia method to be used. For individually owned companion animals, eu - thanasia will often be conducted in a private room in a veterinary clinic or in the home, to minimize ani - mal and owner distress.1 Factors leading to the deci - sion to euthanize should be discussed openly,2 and the animal's owner should be permitted to be present during euthanasia whenever feasible. Owners should be fully informed about the process they are about to observe, including the potential for excitation dur - ing anesthesia and other possible complications.1,3 If one euthanasia method is proving difficult, another method should be tried immediately. Euthanasia should only be attempted when the necessary drugs and supplies are available to ensure a smooth proce - dure and, upon verification of death, owners should be verbally notified.4In animal control, shelter, and rescue situations; research laboratories; and other institutional set - tings, trained technical personnel rather than veteri - narians often perform euthanasia. Training and mon - itoring of these individuals for proficiency vary by setting and state (eg, animal control officers, animal care technicians in laboratories, certified euthanasia technicians in shelters in some states), as does the amount of veterinary supervision required. Eutha - nizing large numbers of animals on a regular basis can be stressful and may result in symptoms of com - passion fatigue.5 To minimize the stress and demands of this duty, trained personnel must be assured that they are performing euthanasia in the most humane manner possible. This requires an organizational commitment to provide ongoing professional train - ing on the latest methods and materials available for euthanasia and effective management of compas - sion fatigue for all personnel.6 In addition, person - nel should be familiar with methods of restraint and euthanasia for all species likely to be encountered in their facility. Areas where euthanasia is conducted in institu - tional settings should be isolated from other activi - ties, where possible, to minimize stress on animals and to provide staff with a professional and dedicated work area. A well-designed euthanasia space provides good lighting with the ability to dim or brighten as re - quired, ventilation, adaptable fixtures, and adequate space for at least 2 people to move around freely in different types of animal-handling situations.6,7 At- tempts should be made to minimize smells, sights, and sounds that may be stressors for animals being eu - thanized. Basic equipment for handling and restraint, a scale, clippers, tourniquets, stethoscope, cleaning supplies, a variety of needles and syringes, and body bags should be readily available to accommodate the needs of potentially diverse animal populations. In addition, a first-aid kit should be available to address minor human injuries, and medical attention should always be sought for bite injuries and more serious human injuries. Euthanasia protocols for companion animals (usually dogs and cats) in institutional settings (eg, shelters, large breeding facilities, research facilities, quarantine facilities, racetracks) may differ from those applied in traditional companion animal clini - cal practices due to situation-specific requirements, including variable access to pharmaceuticals and other equipment, diagnostic and research needs (eg, postmortem tissue samples), and the number of ani - mals to be euthanized. For this reason, general rec - ommendations about euthanasia methods applicable to companion animals are followed by more specific information as to their applicability in frequently en - countered environments. While protocols may differ, the interests of the animal must be given equal con - sideration whether the animal is individually owned or not. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 57S1.2 ACCEPTABLE METHODS S1.2.1 nonInhAled Agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 of a barbituric acid derivative (eg, pentobarbital, pentobarbital combination prod - uct) is the preferred method for euthanasia of dogs, cats, and other small companion animals. Barbitu - rates administered IV may be given alone as the sole agent of euthanasia or as the second step after seda - tion or general anesthesia. Refer to the product label or appropriate species references8 for recommended doses. Current federal drug regulations require strict accounting for barbiturates, and these must be used under the supervision of personnel registered with the US DEA. When IV access would be distressful, dangerous, or impractical (eg, small patient size such as puppies, kittens, small dogs and cats, rodents, and some other nondomestic species or behavioral considerations for some small exotic mammals and feral domestic animals), barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives may be administered IP (eg, sodium pentobarbital, secobarbital; not pentobarbital combination prod - ucts as these have only been approved for IV and in - tracardiac administration). Because of the potential for peritoneal irritation and pain (observed in rats),9 lidocaine has been used with some success in rats to ameliorate discomfort.10,11 Lidocaine was also used in combination with sodium pentobarbital in a laborato - ry comparison of IP and intrahepatic injection routes in cats from animal shelters.12 Additional studies are necessary to determine applicability to and dosing for other species. Nonbarbiturate anesthetic overdose \u2014Inject ket - amine and xylazine given IV, IP, or IM or propofol given IV) is acceptable for euthanasia when animal size, restraint requirements, or other circumstances indicate these drugs are the best option for euthana - sia. Assurance of death is paramount and may require a second step, such as a barbiturate, or additional doses of the anesthetic. For additional information see Section M2, Noninhaled Agents, and Section S2, Laboratory Animals. Tributame \u2014While it is not currently being man - ufactured, Tributame is an acceptable euthanasia drug for dogs provided it is administered IV by an ap - propriately trained individual at recommended dos - ages and at proper injection rates. If barbiturates are not available, its extralabel use in cats is also accept - able. Routes of administration other than IV injec - tion are not acceptable. Aesthetically objectionable agonal breathing may occur in unconscious animals and, consequently, the use of Tributame for owner- attended euthanasia is not recommended. While dis - concerting for observers, because the animal is un - conscious, agonal breathing has limited impact on its welfare. T-61\u2014T-61 is acceptable as an agent of euthanasia, provided it is administered appropriately by trained individuals. Slow IV injection is necessary to avoid muscular paralysis prior to unconsciousness.13 Routes other than IV are unacceptable. T-61 is also not cur - rently being manufactured in the United States but is obtainable from Canada. Should sodium pentobarbital become unavail - able and manufacturing resume in the United States for Tributame and T-61, the latter 2 agents may be - come important for euthanasia of dogs and cats. S1.3 ACCEPTABLE WITH CONDITIONS METHODS S1.3.1 nonInhAled Agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives (alternate routes of administration) \u2014The IP route is not practical for medium or large dogs due to the volume of agent that must be administered and a pro - longed time to death. A better choice for these ani - mals when IV access is unachievable using manual restraint is general anesthesia followed by intraorgan injection. In unconscious or anesthetized animals, in - as an alterna - tive to IV or IP injection of barbiturates when IV ac - cess is difficult.15 Intraorgan injections may speed the rate of barbiturate uptake over standard IP injections, and when an owner is present, this approach may be preferred over the IP route.16 The intrahepatic injec - tion of a combination of sodium pentobarbital and lidocaine in awake cats from animal shelters caused rapid unconsciousness and was more accurately placed than IP injections.12 Therefore, intrahepatic in - jection in awake cats may have limited application in controlled environments when conducted by trained personnel. However, positioning of awake cats for intrahepatic injection is in an upright position with the forequarters elevated rather than in lateral recum - bency. S1.3.2 InhAled Agents Inhaled anesthetics \u2014Overdoses of inhaled an - esthetics administered via chamber (eg, isoflurane, sevoflurane) are acceptable with conditions for eu - thanasia of small mammals and some other species < 7 kg because most vertebrates display aversion behavior to inhaled anesthetics (see Inhaled Agents section for details). Because of the potential for recov - ery, care must be taken to ensure death has occurred prior to disposing of animal remains. Inhaled anes - thetics may also be used to anesthetize small frac - tious animals prior to administration of an injectable euthanasia agent. Carbon monoxide \u2014Carbon monoxide can be used effectively for euthanasia when required con - ditions for administration (see detailed discussion in Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines) can be met. These conditions can be challenging and costly to meet on a practical basis, and there is substantial risk to personnel (hypoxia) if safety precautions are 58 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONnot observed. Consequently, CO is acceptable with conditions for use in institutional situations where ap - propriately designed and maintained equipment and trained and monitored personnel are available to ad - minister it, but it is not recommended for routine eu - thanasia of cats and dogs. It may be considered in un - usual or rare circumstances, such as natural disasters and large-scale disease outbreaks. Alternate methods with fewer conditions and disadvantages are recom - mended for companion animals where feasible. Carbon dioxide \u2014Carbon dioxide can be used effectively for euthanasia when required conditions for administration (see detailed discussion in Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines) can be met. How - ever, just as for use of CO, this can be challenging and costly to do on a practical basis. Narcosis is a hu - man safety risk associated with the use of CO2. Car - bon dioxide is acceptable with conditions for use in institutional situations where appropriately designed and maintained equipment and trained and moni - tored personnel are available to administer it, but it is not recommended for routine euthanasia of cats and dogs. It may be considered in unusual or rare circum - stances, including but not limited to, natural disasters and large-scale disease outbreaks. Alternate methods with fewer conditions and disadvantages are recom - mended for companion animals where feasible. S1.3.3 Phys ICAl Methods Gunshot \u2014Gunshot should only be performed by highly skilled personnel trained in the use of fire - arms (eg, animal control and law enforcement offi - cers, properly trained veterinarians) and only in ju - risdictions that allow for legal firearm use. A method acceptable with conditions, use of gunshot may be appropriate in remote areas or emergency situations in which withholding death by gunshot will result in prolonged, unrelieved pain and suffering of the animal or imminent danger to human life. Protocols for ensuring a humane death by gunshot have been described17,18 and preferred anatomic sites for use of gunshot for dogs and cats are provided in Figures 8 and 9 , respectively. Pre-euthanasia sedation (eg, medi - cation added to food) is recommended, whenever possible, for cats since they may be difficult to shoot humanely.17 Gunshot is not recommended as a rou - tine approach to the euthanasia of dogs, cats, or other small companion animals, and should not be used when other methods are available and practicable. PCB\u2014Use of a PCB by trained personnel in a con - trolled laboratory setting has been described as an ef - fective and humane method of euthanasia for rabbits and dogs.19 The bolt must be placed directly against the skull; therefore, safe and effective application of the technique may be facilitated by pre-euthanasia sedation or anesthesia. Penetrating captive bolt is not recommended as a routine approach to the euthana - sia of dogs, cats, or other small companion animals, and should not be used when other methods are available and practicable.S1.4 ADJUNCTIVE METHODS Potassium chloride \u2014Potassium chloride (1 to 2 mmol/kg, 75 to 150 mg/kg, or 1 to 2 mEq K+/kg) ad - ministered IV or intracardially may be used to eutha - nize companion animals when they are unconscious (unresponsive to noxious stimuli) or under general anesthesia. Use of potassium chloride in awake ani - mals is unacceptable. Nitrogen or argon \u2014Gradual displacement meth - ods using N2 or Ar, alone or with other gases, in awake dogs and cats may result in hypoxia prior to loss of consciousness (see Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines for details). Therefore, administration of N2 or Ar ( < 2% O2) should only be used as an adjunc - tive method for unconscious or anesthetized dogs and cats; prolonged exposure may be necessary to ensure death. Alternate methods with fewer conditions and disadvantages are recommended whenever feasible. Electrocution \u2014Electrocution using alternating current in dogs rendered unconscious by an accept - able means (eg, general anesthesia) may be used for euthanasia (see Section M3.8 of the Guidelines for de - tails). The disadvantages of electrocution outweigh its advantages; therefore it is not recommended for routine use in companion animals. Alternate meth - ods with fewer conditions and disadvantages should be used whenever feasible. S1.5 UNACCEPTABLE METHODS With the exception of IM delivery of select in - jectable anesthetics, the SC, IM, intrapulmonary, and intrathecal routes of administration are unacceptable for administration of injectable euthanasia agents be - cause of the limited information available regarding their effectiveness and high probability of pain asso - ciated with injection in awake animals. Household chemicals, disinfectants, cleaning agents, and pesticides are not acceptable for adminis - tration as euthanasia agents. Other unacceptable approaches to euthanasia in - clude hypothermia and drowning. S1.6 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS S1.6.1 DAnge Rous oR FRAC tIous AnImAls Animals that are unable to be safely and humanely restrained should be sedated by means of drugs deliv - ered orally (eg, gelatin capsules for delivery of drugs in food,20 liquid formulations squirted into mouths21) or remotely (eg, darts, pole syringes) before adminis - tration of euthanasia agents. Doing so will assist in re - lieving anxiety and pain for the animal, in addition to reducing safety risks for personnel. There is a variety of pre-euthanasia drugs that can be administered PO, SC, or IM, alone or in combination, to render animals unconscious with minimal handling in preparation for euthanasia.22 S1.6.2 DIspos Al of AnImAl RemAIns Residues of injectable agents commonly used for euthanasia of companion animals (eg, sodium pento - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 59barbital) tend to persist in the remains and may cause sedation or even death of animals that consume the body. For this reason safe handling and appropriate disposal of the remains are critically important. Addi - tional information is available in Section I8, Disposal of Animal Remains. S1.7 FETUSES AND NEONATES Scientific data23 indicate that mammalian em - bryos and fetuses are in a state of unconsciousness throughout pregnancy and birth. For dogs and cats, this is in part due to moderate neurologic immatu - rity, with sentience being achieved several days after birth. The precocious young of guinea pigs remain in - sentient and unconscious until 75% to 80% of the way through pregnancy and remain unconscious until af - ter birth due to chemical inhibitors (eg, of cerebrocortical activity.23 As a consequence, embryos and fetuses cannot consciously experience feelings such as breathlessness or pain. Therefore, they also \"cannot suffer while dying in utero after the death of the dam, whatever the cause.\"23 Information about developing nonmammalian eggs is available in the Avians; Free-Ranging Nondomestic Ani - mals sections of the Guidelines. Euthanasia of dogs, cats, and other mammals in mid- or late-term pregnancy should be conducted via an injection of a barbiturate or barbituric acid derivative (eg, sodium pentobarbital) as previously described. Fetuses should be left undisturbed in the uterus for 15 to 20 minutes after the bitch or queen has been confirmed dead. This guidance is also gener - ally applicable to nonmammalian species, with eutha - nasia of eggs per guidance provided in the Avians; Animals sections of the Guidelines. Intraperitoneal injections of pento - barbital should be avoided whenever possible during the later stages of pregnancy due to the likelihood of inadvertently entering the uterus, rendering the in - jection ineffective. Altricial neonatal and preweanling mammals are relatively resistant to euthanasia methods that rely on hypoxia as their mode of action. It is also difficult, if not impossible, to gain venous access. Therefore, IP injection of pentobarbital is the recommended meth - od of euthanasia in preweanling dogs, cats, and small mammals. Intraosseous injection may also be used, if strategies are used to minimize discomfort from in - jection by using intraosseous catheters that may be in place (see Section M2, Noninhaled Agents, of the Guidelines), or if the animal is anesthetized prior to injection. During ovariohysterectomy of pregnant dogs and cats and small mammals with altricial neonates, ligation of the uterine blood vessels with retention of the fetuses inside the uterus will result in death of the fetuses. The resistance of altricial neonates (eg, cats, dogs, mice, rats) to euthanasia methods whose mechanisms rely on hypoxia suggests that the uterus should not be opened for substantially longer periods than for precocial neonates,24 perhaps 1 hour or lon - ger. In the case of caesarian section in late-term preg - nancy, IP injection of pentobarbital is recommended for fetuses that must be euthanized for congenital deformities or illness and that have been removed from the uterus (creating the potential that success - ful breathing may have occurred). S1.8 EUTHANASIA IN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS S1.8.1 IndIvIduAl AnImAls In PResen Ce of Owne Rs Pre-euthanasia sedation or anesthesia should be provided whenever practicable, either before or af - ter the owner(s) has had the opportunity to spend some final moments with their pet. Once the animal is calm, either direct venipuncture or use of an IV catheter is acceptable for IV injection of the eutha - nizing agent. Use of an IV catheter prevents repeat injections and minimizes the need for restraint while pet owners are present. When circulation is compro - mised by the animal's condition and sedation or anes - thesia may reduce the likelihood of successful injec - tion, it may be necessary to proceed with IV injection in the awake animal, or another route of administra - tion of euthanizing agent might be considered. Alter - natively, general anesthesia may be induced, followed by administration of a euthanasia agent. S1.8.2 BReed Ing fACIlItIes Euthanasia protocols in large breeding facilities may differ from those utilized in a clinical practice set - ting. Indications for euthanasia in breeding facilities include neonates with congenital defects, acquired abnormalities or diseases within any segment of the population, or other conditions that render animals unsuitable for breeding or sale. Euthanasia may be performed on an individual-animal basis, or in groups. Euthanasia method is determined by animal species, size, age, and number of animals to be euthanized. Barbiturates are commonly administered IV or IP for individual euthanasia of any species, and for all ages of dogs and cats. Carbon dioxide euthanasia is common - ly utilized for individual or group euthanasia of small animals, including ferrets, rodents, and rabbits. Re - gardless of method and number of animals being eu - thanized, procedures must be performed in a profes - sional, compassionate manner by trained individuals under veterinary oversight. Appropriate techniques for assuring death must be applied individually, re - gardless of the number of animals being euthanized. S1.8.3 AnImAl Cont Rol, shelte RIng, And ResCue fACIlItIes The preferred method of euthanasia in these fa - cilities is injection of a barbiturate or barbituric acid 60 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONderivative with appropriate animal handling. When euthanizing animals that are well socialized without pre-euthanasia sedation or anesthesia, appropriate handling usually involves 2 trained people. One indi - vidual restrains the animal and the other administers the euthanasia agent.25 When euthanizing distressed, dangerous, or frac - tious animals, a sedative or anesthetic should be ad - ministered prior to attempting euthanasia. When the necessary restraint can be performed safely (appro - priate handling techniques and equipment must be used), a pre-euthanasia sedative or anesthetic can be delivered IM or PO. After administration of the seda - tive or anesthetic, the animal is released so that it can return to a comfortable low-stress location (eg, dimly lighted cage or area) while the drug takes effect.22 Be- cause of the diversity of animals received by shelters, technicians performing euthanasia must have a good understanding of animal behavior and restraint, the proper use of equipment, and the variety of euthana - sia drugs available and their effects.26 S1.8.4 lABoRAtoRy AnImAl fACIlItIes Euthanasia for companion animals in scientific settings must be approved by the IACUC. The IACUC has mandatory veterinary input and considers animal welfare, requirements for postmortem tissue speci - mens, and interference of euthanasia agents or meth - ods with study results. Scientific and husbandry staff form strong emotional bonds with companion ani - mals in scientific settings, so sensitivity to grief and compassion fatigue is necessary. S2 Laboratory Animals Methods acceptable with conditions are equiva - lent to acceptable methods when all criteria for ap - plication of a method can be met. S2.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS General comments about companion animals, farm animals, poikilotherms, and birds are provided elsewhere in the Guidelines, and usually apply to these species in the laboratory setting. Some other commonly used laboratory animal species are ad - dressed later in the text. Most laboratory mammals currently used in biomedical research are small ro - dents that are maintained in large numbers. Venous access in these animals is typically difficult, and in - jectable agents are usually delivered via the IP route. In addition to humane outcomes, an important consideration in the choice of method for euthana - sia of laboratory animals is the research objectives for the animals being euthanized. Euthanasia meth - ods can lead to metabolic and histologic artifacts that may affect research outcomes. For example, isoflurane may artificially elevate blood glucose con - centrations,27 while IP injection of barbiturates can create artifacts in intestinal tissues28 and euthanasia by inhalation of CO2 may elevate serum potassium concentrations.29 Time elapsed between euthanasia and tissue collection can also be a critical factor af - fecting choice of euthanasia method.30-32 Research needs may require the use of an adjunctive method (eg, bilateral thoracotomy, exsanguination, perfusion with fixatives, injection of potassium chloride). The application of such adjunctive methods is acceptable when the animal is fully anesthetized. Animals used in infectious disease studies may require special han - dling for animal and human health and safety. S2.2 SMALL LABORATORY AND WILD-CAUGHT RODENTS (MICE, RATS, HAMSTERS, GUINEA PIGS, GERBILS, DEGUS, COTTON RATS, ETC) All activities related to the euthanasia of rodents deserve consideration equivalent to the euthanasia method itself, and may factor into the choice of meth - od. Activities that contribute to distress in rodents in - clude transport, handling (in animals not accustomed to it), disruption of compatible groups, and elimina - tion of established scent marks.31-45 As eliminating all sources of distress may not be practical or possible, the selected method of euthanizing rodents should minimize these sources of potential distress. Meth - ods of euthanasia likely to elicit distress vocalizations or pheromones that other animals in the room could hear or smell may be best performed in another loca - tion, if transportation distress can be minimized. Sim - ilarly, wild-caught animals should be handled and eu - thanized in the manner least stressful to the animals. Death should be confirmed by physical examination, ensured by adjunctive physical method, or obviated by validation of euthanasia chambers and process.46 S2.2.1 ACCeptABle methods Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Injectable barbiturates and barbiturate combinations generally act quickly and smoothly to render rodents unconscious. The euthanasia dose is typically 3 times the anesthetic dose. Pentobarbital is the most commonly used barbiturate for laboratory rodents because of its long shelf life and rapidity of action. There are reports that pain may be associated with barbiturate injections given via the IP route,10,11,47,48 but the degree of pain and a suitable method for con - trolling pain have yet to be defined. The concurrent use of local anesthetics and anticonvulsants may aid in prevention of pain,47 but it should be considered that these compounds may also cause pain with IP injection. Dissociative agent combinations \u2014In conscious rodents, ketamine and similar dissociative agents should be used in combination with an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist such as xylazine or benzodiazepines such as diazepam.49 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 61S2.2.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods \u2014Halothane, rane, sevoflurane, or desflurane, with or without nitrous oxide, is acceptable with conditions for eu - thanasia of laboratory rodents.50 These agents may be useful in cases where physical restraint is difficult or impractical. When used as a sole euthanasia agent delivered via vaporizer for anesthetic induction and overdose, animals may need to be exposed for pro - longed time periods to ensure death.51-57 Death can be rapid when using the open-drop technique, but care must be taken to ensure that the rodent does not come in direct contact with the anesthetic. Carbon dioxide\u2014 Carbon dioxide, with or with - out premedication with halogenated anesthetics, is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of small ro - dents.58 Compressed CO2 gas in cylinders are the rec - ommended source of CO2 because gas inflow to the chamber can be precisely regulated. An optimal flow rate for CO2 euthanasia systems should displace 30% to 70% of the chamber or cage volume/min, with the understanding that there is potential for increased distress due to dyspnea at lower flow rates or mucous membrane pain associated with flow rates at the high ends of this range.31,32,54,56,59-64 However, as there is no clear evidence of a flow rate that optimally mini - mizes both pain and distress for all species, sexes, and genetic backgrounds, veterinarians should use their professional judgment to determine which flow rate is appropriate for their circumstances.31,32,56 Prefilled chambers are not recommended due to the potential for significant pain upon inhalation of the gas.60,65 If euthanasia is not conducted in the home cage, induc - tion chambers should be emptied and cleaned be - tween uses. Addition of O2 to CO2 will prolong the time to death and may complicate determination of consciousness. There appears to be no advantage to combining O2 with CO2 for euthanasia.11,60 Carbon monoxide \u2014Although CO administra - tion is not commonly used in laboratory animal set - tings and has been determined to be as aversive as other inhalants,52,66 it is acceptable with conditions as a method of rodent euthanasia when the conditions for effective and safe use can be met (see Inhaled Agents). Nitrous oxide \u2014Although nitrous oxide may be less aversive than the other inhaled gases described in this document,67 it is a weak anesthetic with a long time to loss of consciousness and should not be used alone.68 Nitrous oxide can be used in conjunction with other gases to shorten the time to loss of con - sciousness.50,69 S2.2.2.2 Noninhaled agents Tribromoethanol (USP/National Formulary/British Pharmacopeia) product, tribromo - ethanol is a commonly used rodent anesthetic. Its use is controversial due to its reported adverse effects (peritonitis and death).70 However, many IACUCs have approved its use in rodents. Because there are no reports of tribromoethanol being used as a sole agent for euthanasia, it is recommended only as an anesthetic before the application of an approved sec - ondary method.70,71 Tribromoethanol must be pre - pared and stored properly and administered at the appropriate dosage. Ethanol \u2014Intraperitoneal injections of 70% to 100% ethanol may be an appropriate method of eu - thanasia for adult mice when physical methods are not desired or other euthanasia agents are unavail - able.72-75 Mice injected with 0.5 mL of 70% or 100% ethanol demonstrated gradual loss of muscle control, loss of righting reflex, respiratory and cardiac arrest, and death in 2 to 4 minutes.72,74 The use of ethanol in mice < 35 days of age is questionable due to the long latency to death.75 Ethanol is not recommended in larger species such as rats due to the large volume required to induce death.74,75 S2.2.2.3 Physical methods Cervical dislocation \u2014Cervical dislocation is used in laboratory settings. Cervical dislocation re - quires neither special equipment nor transport of the animal and yields tissues uncontaminated by chemi - cal agents. Loss of cortical function following cervical dislocation is rapid and occurs within 5 to 10 seconds as measured by a significant reduction in amplitude recordings of visual evoked responses and EEG.76,77 Cervical dislocation is acceptable with conditions for mice and rats < 200 g. Personnel should be trained on anesthetized and/or dead animals to demonstrate proficiency. Decapitation \u2014Decapitation is used in laborato - ry settings because it yields tissues uncontaminated by chemical agents. Loss of cortical function follow - ing decapitation is rapid and occurs within 5 to 30 seconds as measured by a significant reduction in amplitude recordings of visual evoked responses and EEG changes.76-78 Specialized rodent guillotines are available and must be kept clean, in good condition with sharp blades. If handled correctly, rats and mice do not show evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-ad - renal axis activation from decapitation or from being present when other rats or mice are decapitated.79,80 Decapitation is acceptable with conditions for mice and rats. Personnel should be trained on anesthetized or dead animals to demonstrate proficiency. Focused beam microwave irradiation \u2014Fo- cused beam microwave irradiation, using a machine professionally designed for animal euthanasia (see Physical Methods), is acceptable with conditions for euthanizing mice and rats. It is the preferred method when immediate fixation of brain metabolites is re - quired for research purposes. S2.2.3 unACC eptABle methods S2.2.3.1 Inhaled agents Nitrogen and argon \u2014Administration of N2 or Ar is only acceptable in anesthetized mammals, as a 62 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONcoexisting O2 concentration of < 2% is necessary to achieve unconsciousness and death. Achieving that condition is difficult. In addition, Ar has been shown to be highly aversive to rats.81 Although N2 and Ar can kill animals,82-84 other methods of euthanasia are preferable. S2.2.3.2 Noninhaled agents Potassium chloride \u2014Intravenous or intracardi - ac administration of potassium chloride is not accept - able as a sole approach to euthanasia. Neuromuscular blocking agents \u2014Paralytic agents are unacceptable for use as sole euthanasia agents. Injectable barbiturates and neuromuscular blocking agents \u2014Combining injectable barbiturates blocking agents in the same sy - ringe for administration is unacceptable because the neuromuscular blocking agents may take effect be - fore the animal is anesthetized. Opioids \u2014Opioids are unacceptable for euthana - sia of laboratory animals as they are not rapidly act - ing, require high doses, and are not true anesthetic agents. Urethane \u2014Urethane is a human carcinogen used as a laboratory rodent anesthetic under certain conditions. It has a slow onset of action but a long duration of anesthesia. Because there are no reports of urethane being used as a sole agent for euthanasia, it is recommended only as an anesthetic before the application of an approved adjunctive method.53,70,71 -Chloralose \u2014-Chloralose is unacceptable as a sole agent of euthanasia. -Chloralose is a hypnotic agent that has poor analgesic properties53,71 and is recommended only as an anesthetic before the appli - cation of an approved adjunctive method. S2.2.4 fetuses And neon Ates Mammalian fetuses are unconscious in utero due to a combination of factors, such as low oxygen tension and hormonal influences in the uterus sup - pressing consciousness. Rat and mouse pups are born neurologically immature when compared with hu - mans, and their afferent pain pathways are not well developed until after postnatal day 5 to 7, with corti - cal development occurring later.85-90 Any laboratory rodents with altricial young, such as mice and rats, must be differentiated from rodents with precocial young, such as guinea pigs. Precocial young should be treated as adults. S2.2.4.1 Acceptable methods Euthanasia of the dam and mammalian fe - tuses \u2014Rodent fetuses along with other mammals are unconscious in utero and hypoxia does not evoke a response.91 Therefore, it is unnecessary to remove fe - tuses for euthanasia after the dam is euthanized. S2.2.4.1.1 Noninhaled agents Injectable barbiturates alone and tion with local anesthetics and anticonvulsants; dissociative agents combined with 2-adrenergic receptor agonist or benzodiazepines \u2014These agents are acceptable for use in fetuses or neonates.92 See discussion on the use of these agents in adult rodents. S2.2.4.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S2.2.4.2.1 Inhaled agents Inhaled anesthetics \u2014Nonflammable volatile an - esthetic agents are effective for in utero fetuses. Neo - natal mice may take up to 50 minutes to die from CO2 exposure,93 and neonatal rats may take as long as 35 minutes.94 Adequate exposure time should be provid - ed, or an adjunctive method (eg, cervical dislocation, or decapitation) should be performed after a neonate is nonresponsive to painful stimuli. An adjunctive method (eg, cervical dislocation, decapitation) must be performed when halogenated anesthetics are used on neonatal rodents to avoid the possibility of recov - ery.55 S2.2.4.2.2 Physical methods Hypothermia \u2014The gradual cooling of fetuses and altricial neonates (mice and rats) is acceptable with conditions. There are no data to support the use of hypothermia as a single method, and it should be followed with a secondary method following loss of movement. As cold surfaces can cause tissue damage and presumably pain, the animals should not come in direct contact with ice or precooled surfaces. Hy - pothermia for anesthesia is not recommended after approximately 10 days of age.53,88-90,95-97 Therefore, it is also an unacceptable euthanasia method in animals older than this age.98 Rapid freezing \u2014Mouse and rat fetuses and neo - nates < 5 days of age may be quickly killed by rapid freezing in liquid N2.23,96,97 Decapitation \u2014Decapitation using scissors or sharp blades is acceptable with conditions for altricial neonates.96,97 Some rodent neonates, whether altricial or precocial, may have a tissue mass that is too large for scissors, so appropriate decapitation tools should be selected. Cervical dislocation\u2014 Cervical dislocation by pinching and disrupting the spinal cord in the high cervical region is acceptable with conditions for fetal and neonatal mice and rats. S2.3 LABORATORY FARM ANIMALS, DOGS, CATS, FERRETS, AND NONHUMAN PRIMATES S2.3.1 gene RAl Cons IdeRAtIons The research goals will often influence the choice of method of euthanasia for farm animals, dogs, cats, and ferrets. Generally, sedation (as needed) followed by IV injectable barbiturates will be the preferred method. Tributame administered IV by trained per - sonnel may be an appropriate replacement for dogs if injectable barbiturates are not available. For more information on other methods of euthanasia of farm and companion species, consult the appropriate sec - tions of the guidelines. For nonhuman primates and other wild-caught or nondomesticated animals used in the laboratory, some general principles apply. Again, the research AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 63being conducted may influence the choice of eutha - nasia method, and if the institutional animal care and use program staff is unfamiliar with a species, re - searchers working with the species may provide valu - able guidance. Appropriate restraint for the species must always be applied. Distress in animals unfamil - iar with handling should be minimized. Venous ac - cess should be established or IM agents may be used (delivered via remote injection equipment if neces - sary) for sedation. These animals are preferentially euthanized with an injectable barbiturate. S2.3.2 speCIAl CAses When to be euthanized are fully anesthe - tized, adjunctive methods such as bilateral thoracoto - my, exsanguination, perfusion, and IV or intracardiac injection of potassium chloride are acceptable. S2.4 LABORATORY RABBITS S2.4.1 gene RAl Cons IdeRAtIons Recommended euthanasia methods of rabbits depend on the facilities and conditions in which the animals are housed and maintained. In a controlled setting such as a biomedical research facility where researchers have access to restraint devices and con - trolled drugs, IV injection of barbiturates is usually used. In large commercial production operations for biomedical research or meat, or to safely euthanize injured wild rabbits, the method selected will de - pend on the availability of resources and the skill and training of the operator. In all situations, the animals should be handled and euthanized in the manner least distressful to them. Death should always be veri - fied. Lack of breathing and palpable heartbeat as well as a fixed dilated pupil are some of the easiest recog - nized indicators of death. S2.4.2 ACCeptABle methods S2.4.2.1 Noninhaled agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 If rabbits are conditioned to handling or restraint de - vices are available, venous access may be obtained via the ear. In the case of fractious rabbits, sedation may be necessary to gain venous access for administration of an injectable barbiturate or injectable barbiturate combination. Barbiturates may also be administered IP. The concurrent use of local anesthetics and an - ticonvulsants may aid in prevention of pain,47 but it should be considered that these compounds may also cause pain with IP injection. These approaches are acceptable for companion rabbits as well. S2.4.3 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S2.4.3.1 Inhaled agents Halogenated anesthetics \u2014Inhaled anesthetics will generally be available only in a controlled set - ting, such as a biomedical research facility or vet - erinary care provider. In these situations, it is best to preanesthetize the animal with a sedative before removing it from the home cage and relocating it to access restraint devices and a gas anesthesia ma - chine. This method will reduce their natural tenden - cy to breath-hold when confronted with unpleasant odors.99-101 Animals already under anesthesia may be euthanized by an overdose of anesthetic. Carbon dioxide \u2014The recommended CO2 dis- placement rate for rabbits is 50% to 60% of the cham - ber or cage volume/min. As fossorial animals, rabbits appear to have a higher tolerance for elevated CO2 levels, so its use as a sole euthanasia agent may cause distress.102,103 In high concentrations (70%, 80%, CO2 has been reported104 to result in aversive behaviors for 15 seconds before the onset of unconsciousness. Walshb reported no distress behav - iors observed when CO2 was administered to rabbits at lower flow rates of approximately 28% and 58% chamber volume replacement/min. The fast-flow rate is recommended for CO2 euthanasia, as it resulted in significantly earlier loss of sensibility (40 seconds) and death than gradual fill (99 seconds).b Premedi - cation with sedatives may reduce potential aversion responses. S2.4.3.2 Physical methods Cervical dislocation\u2014 Cervical dislocation is ac - ceptable with conditions for rabbits when performed by individuals with a demonstrated high degree of technical proficiency. The need for technical compe - tency is great in heavy or mature rabbits in which the large muscle mass in the cervical region makes manual cervical dislocation more difficult. Mechani - cal devices designed to firmly hold the rabbit's head and facilitate the operator's applying downward force to the hips and back legs reduce the strength needed by the operator to euthanize rabbits. These devices have been shown to be highly effective (96%) for preweaned kits, growers, and adults. Training with cadavers is recommended.105 PCB\u2014The use of rabbit-sized PCBs to euthanize rabbits in laboratory or production facilities is accept - able with conditions. The captive bolt must be main - tained in clean working order, positioned correctly (by placing the captive bolt slightly paramedian on the frontal bone as close to the ears as possible),106 and operated safely by trained personnel. It is essen - tial to stabilize the head to prevent misses. Animals should be restrained on nonslip flooring, preferably in an open-top container allowing the rear of the rabbit to be pressed against the container wall. Us - ing the nondominant hand, the operator should re - strain the rabbit by pressing on the shoulder blades, and the thumb and forefinger should be placed gently around the neck of the rabbit. These devices are of - ten aesthetically displeasing and often result in envi - ronmental contamination, which may be a significant concern when sick animals are being removed from the colony. Operators must be trained, preferably on cadavers. NPCB \u2014The use of rabbit-sized NPCB to eutha GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONnize rabbits in laboratory or production facilities is acceptable with conditions. The NPCB has been shown to result in immediate insensibility in 100% of the events.105 Animals should be restrained on non - slip flooring, preferably in an open-top container al - lowing the rear of the rabbit to be pressed against the container wall. Using the nondominant hand, the operator should restrain the rabbit by pressing on the shoulder blades, and the thumb and forefinger should be placed gently around the neck of the rabbit. The device must be maintained in clean working order, positioned correctly (center of the forehead, with the barrel placed in front of the ears and behind the eyes), and discharged twice in rapid succession at the pressure recommended for the age and size of the rabbit (55 psi for preweaned kits, 70 psi for growers, 90 psi for adults; Figure 10 ).105 Operators must be trained, preferably on cadavers. S2.4.4 speCIAl CAses When rabbits to be euthanized are in a surgical plane of anesthesia, adjunctive methods such as de - livery of potassium chloride, exsanguination, or bilat - eral thoracotomy are acceptable. Manual application of blunt force trauma to the head has been shown to be difficult and aesthetically displeasing, resulting in undesired tissue damage, as well as being less effective than other means.105,107,b Blunt force trauma should be used only in emergency situations under extenuating circumstances, such as an injured rabbit too large for the operator to cervi - cally dislocate and an operator without any support - ing resources. S2.5 LABORATORY FISH, AMPHIBIANS, AND REPTILES Recommending euthanasia methods for finfish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles used in biomedical research is challenging due to the enor - mous number of species in use and variations in their biological and physiologic characteristics. In this sec - tion, only the most commonly used methods will be discussed for several frequently used species. Other methods less often used for euthanizing species used in research are discussed in detail in the relevant sec - tions of the Guidelines. See these sections for addi - tional information. There are no US FDA-approved drugs for eutha - nasia of aquatic animals. Tricaine is drug for temporary immobilization (sedation, anesthesia) of finfish, amphibians, and oth - er aquatic, cold-blooded animals. Immersion of adult zebrafish in MS 222 for 10 minutes following loss of rhythmic opercular movement was previously rec - ommended. However, because recovery of fish after exposure for this time has been shown to occur, 30 minutes is recommended as a precautionary measure until research is available to demonstrate immersion times needed to reliably cause irreversible death in ze - brafish. Zebrafish show some signs of stress when im -mersed in MS 222, and a secondary (physical) method of euthanasia is recommended to ensure death.108 MS 222 alone is not effective for euthanasia of zebrafish eggs, embryos, or larvae ( < 14 days old), and other methods should be used for these life stages.109 As described in the aquatics section it is accept - able for zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) to be euthanized by rapid chilling (2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C) until loss of orientation and cessation of operculur movements. Subsequent addi - tional exposure of the fish to chilled water for times specific to fish size and age108,110,111 should be used to ensure death. Rapid chilling of adult zebrafish result - ed in cessation of vital signs (10.6 \u00b1 3.28 seconds) 20 times as fast as in the case of MS 222 overdose (216.3 \u00b1 62 seconds).112 Adult zebrafish should be exposed for a minimum of 10 additional minutes following the loss of opercular movements. Zebrafish fry 4 to 7 days after fertilization (dpf) should be exposed for at least 20 additional minutes following loss of opercular movements.113 Rapid chilling (as well as MS 222) has been shown to be an unreliable euthanasia method for embryos < 3 dpf.108,112,114 Immersion in diluted so - dium or calcium hypochlorite solution is acceptable for embryos up to 7 days of age.115 If necessary to en - sure death of other life stages, rapid chilling may be followed by either an approved adjunctive euthanasia method or a humane killing method. Until further research is conducted, rapid chilling is acceptable with conditions for other small-bodied tropical and subtropical stenothermic species. Amphibian species commonly used in research include the African and Western clawed frog ( X lae - vis, Xenopus tropicalis ), species are best euthanized via a physical method while fully anesthetized. While injection of sodium pentobarbital IV, intracelomically, or in the lymph spaces is an acceptable method of euthanasia of these species, high doses are often required and these agents may have an inconsistent time to loss of consciousness (S7.3.4.1).116 S3. Animals Farmed for Food and Fiber Methods acceptable with conditions are equiva - lent to acceptable methods when all criteria for ap - plication of a method are met. S3.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS While some methods of slaughter and depopula - tion might meet the criteria for euthanasia identified by the POE, others will not and comments in this doc - ument are limited to methods used for euthanasia. The following section relates to species of animals domesticated for agricultural purposes, specifically cattle, sheep, goats, swine, and poultry, regardless of the context in which that animal is being kept or the basis for the decision to euthanize it. Suggestions for euthanasia of agricultural animals such as cam - elids, bison, and water buffalo, which are customarily AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 65raised to meet niche market demands for fiber and food, are also included. Handling of animals prior to euthanasia should be as stress free as possible. This is facilitated by en - suring that facilities are well designed, appropriate equipment is available, and animal handlers are prop - erly trained and their performance is monitored.117-121 Regardless of the method of euthanasia used, death must be confirmed before disposal of the ani - mal's remains. The most important indicator of death is lack of a heartbeat. However, because this may be difficult to evaluate or confirm in some situations, animals can be observed for secondary indicators of death, which might include lack of movement over a period of time (30 minutes beyond detection of a heartbeat) or the presence of rigor mortis. S3.2 BOVIDS barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Barbiturates act rapidly and normally induce a smooth transition from consciousness to unconsciousness and death\u2014a desirable outcome for the operator and observers. Although cost is a deterrent to the use of barbiturates for euthanasia of large numbers of ani - mals, these agents tend to be less expensive than oth - er injectable pharmaceuticals. Drawbacks to the use of barbiturates are that their administration requires adequate restraint of the animal, personnel who are registered with the US DEA (and other appropriate state authority where required), strict control over the drug with accounting of the amount used,122 and fewer options for disposal of animal remains because of potential residues. S3.2.1.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S3.2.1.2.1 Physical methods In emergency situations, such as euthanasia of a bovid that is not restrained, it may be difficult to re - strain a dangerous animal for IV injection. While ad - ministration of a sedative might be desirable, in some situations it is possible the animal could injure itself or bystanders before a sedative could take effect. In such cases, a neuromuscular blocking agent (eg, suc - cinylcholine) may be administered to the bovid IM or IV, but the bovid must be euthanized via an appropri - ate method as soon as the bovid can be controlled. Succinylcholine alone or without sufficient anesthet - ic is not acceptable for euthanasia. Gunshot \u2014Gunshot is the most common meth - od used for on-farm euthanasia of cattle.123 Death is caused by destruction of brain tissue and the degree of brain damage inflicted by the bullet is dependent on the firearm, type of bullet (or shotshell for shot - guns), and accuracy of aim. Handguns\u2014 Handguns or pistols are short-bar - reled firearms that may be fired with 1 hand. For eu - thanasia, use of handguns is limited to close-range shooting (within 1 to 2 feet or 30 to 60 cm) of the intended target. Calibers ranging from .32 to .45 are recommended for euthanasia of cattle.124 Bullets should be selected to have adequate penetration abil - ity. Older types of hollow-point bullets are designed to expand and fragment on impact with their targets, which reduces the depth of penetration. Under ideal conditions and good penetration of the skull, hollow- point bullets are able to cause extensive damage to neural tissues; however, because penetration of the skull is the first criterion in euthanasia, a solid lead bullet is preferred. Since the publication of the previ - ous edition, many new types of bullets and firearms are now available. These must be of sufficient muzzle velocity to ensure penetration. The muzzle velocity specifications are on most ammunition packaging. The .22 caliber handgun is generally not recommend - ed for routine euthanasia of adult cattle regardless of bullet used, because of the inability to consistently achieve desirable muzzle energies with standard commercial loads.124 Rifles\u2014 A rifle is a long-barreled firearm that is usually fired from the shoulder. Unlike the barrel of a shotgun, which has a smooth bore for shot shells, the bores of handgun and rifles contain a series of helical grooves (called rifling) that cause the bullet to spin as it travels through the barrel. Rifling imparts stability to the bullet and improves accuracy. For this reason, rifles are the preferred firearm for euthanasia when it is necessary to shoot from a distance. Another reason a rifle is preferred is that a longer barrel may improve bullet performance. Rifles are capable of delivering bullets at much higher muzzle velocities and energies and thus are not the ideal choice for euthanasia of animals in indoor or short-range conditions. General recommendations on rifle selection for use in euthanasia of cattle include .22, .223, .243, .270, .308, and others.124-126 Results of at least 1 study126 suggest that the .22 LR may not be the best selection of a firearm for euthanasia of adult cattle because of poor penetration, deflection, and fragmentation of the bullet. Standard- and high- velocity bullets fired from a .22 caliber rifle at a range of 25 m failed to penetrate skulls of steers and heif - ers studied. On the other hand, the .223 and .30-06 performed satisfactorily (eg, traversed the skull and caused sufficient brain damage to cause death) when fired from a distance of 25 m.126 This is in agreement with similar information indicating that .22 Magnum or larger-caliber firearms provide higher muzzle ener - gies and more consistent results when delivered to the proper anatomic site.125 When the most appropriate firearm is being cho - sen for the purpose of euthanasia, there are several factors to be considered, including caliber of the fire - arm, type of bullet or shotshell, distance from the target, age of the animal (aged animals have harder skulls), sex of the animal (bull or cow), and accuracy of aim. Based upon available information, if a .22 LR is to be used the following conditions apply: 1) the fire -66 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONarm of choice is a rifle: 2) a solid-point bullet should be used, 3) it must be fired within close range of the skull (within 30 to 90 cm [1 to 3 feet]), and 4) the bul - let must be directed so that proper anatomic place - ment on the skull is assured.127 Shotguns\u2014 Shotguns loaded with birdshot (lead or steel BBs) or slugs (solid lead projectiles specifi - cally designed for shotguns) are appropriate from a distance of 1 to 2 yards (1 to 2 m). Although all shot - guns are lethal at close range, the preferred gauges for euthanasia of cattle are 20, 16, or 12. Number 6 or larger birdshot or shotgun slugs are the best choices for euthanasia of cattle.124 Birdshot begins to disperse as it leaves the end of the gun barrel; however, if the operator stays within short range of the intended ana - tomic site, the birdshot will strike the skull as a com - pact bolus or mass of BBs with ballistic characteris - tics on entry that are similar to a solid lead bullet. At close range, penetration of the skull is assured with massive destruction of brain tissue from the disper - sion of birdshot into the brain that results in immedi - ate loss of consciousness and rapid death. The Canadian study126 cited previously evalu - ated several firearms, including the .410 and 12-gauge shotguns. The .410 loaded with either number 4 or number 6 birdshot fired from a distance of 1 m was very effective and had the advantage of less recoil compared with other firearms used. The 12-gauge shotgun loaded with number 7 1/2 birdshot fired from a distance of 2 m from its target was effective but considered to be more powerful than necessary. Results of a 1-oz rifled slug fired from a 12-gauge shot - gun at a distance of 25 m failed to penetrate the brain not because it lacked power, rather because of faulty shot placement. Researchers concluded that the rail sighting system on the shotgun was not sufficient for accurate shot placement if it was necessary to shoot from a distance. They also believed that recoil from this firearm would likely make it unpleasant to use if it were necessary to euthanize a large number of animals.126 One advantage of euthanasia using a shotgun is that when properly directed the birdshot will have sufficient energy to penetrate the skull but is unlikely to exit the skull. In the case of a free bullet or shot - gun slug there is always the possibility of the bullet or slug exiting the skull, creating an injury risk for operators and observers. For operator and bystander safety, the muzzle of a shotgun (or any other firearm) should never be held directly against the animal's head. Discharge of the firearm results in development of enormous pressure within the barrel that can re - sult in explosion of the barrel if the muzzle end is obstructed or blocked. PCB or NPCB \u2014Penetrating captive bolts are recommended for euthanasia of mature cattle in field situations. The use of NPCBs should be limited to calves. In large cattle NPCB is less effective than PCB.128,129 Styles include in-line (cylindrical) and pis - tol grip (resembling a handgun) versions. Pneumatic captive bolt guns (air powered) are limited to use in slaughter plant environments. Models using gun - powder charges are more often used in farm environ - ments. They consist of a steel bolt and piston at 1 end, housed within a barrel. Upon firing, the rapid expan - sion of gas within the breech and barrel propels the piston forward driving the bolt through the muzzle. A series of cushions are strategically located within the barrel to dissipate excess energy of the bolt. Depend - ing upon model, the bolt may be manually or auto - matically retracted. Accurate placement over the ide - al anatomic site, energy (ie, bolt velocity), and depth of penetration of the bolt determine effectiveness of the device to cause a loss of consciousness and death. Bolt velocity is dependent on maintenance in particu - lar, as well as cleaning and storage of the cartridge charges. Bolt velocities of 55 to 58 m/s are desirable for effective captive bolt use in packing plants.130-133 Recommended minimum bolt velocities proposed for shooting bulls are as high as 70 m/s. In packing plants where bolt velocity is of particular concern, bolt velocity is routinely monitored to assure proper function of these devices.134 In general, captive bolt guns, whether penetrat - ing or nonpenetrating, induce immediate loss of con - sciousness, but death is not always assured with the use of this device alone. In a study of 1,826 fed steers and heifers, 3 (0.16%) had signs of a return to sen - sibility or consciousness.129 Results were similar in observations of 692 bulls and cows where 8 (1.2%) animals had signs consistent with a return to con - sciousness.129 Failure to achieve a 100% loss of con - sciousness with no return to a conscious mental state was attributed to storage of the captive bolt charges in a damp location, poor maintenance of firing pins, inexperienced personnel operating the captive bolt (use of the incorrect anatomic site), misfires associ - ated with a dirty trigger on the captive bolt, and use of the device on cows and bulls with thick, heavy skulls.129,135 At the present time, an adjunctive method such as exsanguination, pithing, or the IV injection of a saturated solution of potassium chloride is recom - mended to ensure death when PCB is used.127 A new - er version of PCB has emerged in recent years.125 This device is equipped with an extended bolt with suf - ficient length and cartridge power to increase dam - age to the brain, including the brainstem. This device is being studied at the present time and may offer a euthanasia option with the PCB that does not require the need for an adjunctive method. Captive bolt guns are attractive options for eu - thanasia because they offer a greater degree of safety to the operator and bystanders; but they should only be used by trained people. The muzzle should always be pointed toward the ground and away from the body or bystanders in case of accidental discharge. Protective gear for both ears and eyes is strongly rec - ommended. Unlike techniques described for gunshot, the AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 67animal must be restrained for accurate placement of the captive bolt. And, unlike use of a firearm, proper use of the captive bolt requires that the muzzle of the device be held firmly against the animal's head. Once the animal is restrained, discharge of the captive bolt should occur with little or no delay so that animal distress is minimized. Adjunctive methods should be implemented as soon as the animal is rendered un - conscious to avoid a possible return to sensibility. Thus, when conducting euthanasia by captive bolt, some preplanning and preparation improves the like - lihood of a successful outcome. Visual indicators that an animal has been ren - dered unconscious from captive bolt or gunshot in - clude the following: immediate collapse; brief tetanic spasms followed by uncoordinated hind limb move - ments; immediate and sustained cessation of rhyth - mic breathing; lack of coordinated attempts to rise; absence of vocalization; glazed or glassy appearance to the eyes; and absence of eye reflexes.117 Nervous system control of the blink or corneal reflex is located in the brainstem; therefore, the presence of a corneal reflex is highly suggestive that an animal is still con - scious. Anatomic landmarks for use of the PCB and gunshot \u2014In cattle, the point of entry of the projec - tile should be at the intersection of 2 imaginary lines, each drawn from the outside corner of the eye to the center of the base of the opposite horn, or an equiva - lent position in polled animals (Figure 11A) .136 In long-faced cattle or young stock, a point on the mid - line of the face that is halfway between the top of the poll and an imaginary line connecting the out - side corners of the eyes can be used (Figure 11B) . Proper positioning of the firearm or PCB is necessary to achieve the desired results. Euthanasia of bison \u2014Proper handling of bi - son requires an understanding and respect for the wild nature of these animals. Handlers should strive to minimize stress by moving animals slowly utiliz - ing techniques similar to those applied in low-stress handling of cattle. Restraint requires specialized han - dling equipment designed to accommodate bison body conformation. The recommended method for the euthanasia of a bison is gunshot. A minimum of 1,356 J (1,000 feet-lb) of muzzle energy is required for euthanasia of yearlings, cows, and mature bulls. This limits the fire - arm options to higher-caliber centerfire rifles (eg, 30- 30, 270, 30-06, and others). The majority of handguns produce muzzle energies well below 1,356 J (1,000 feet-lb) and would not be appropriate for euthanasia of mature bison.137 The preferred anatomic site for entry of a bullet is on the forehead approximately 2.5 cm (1 inch) above an imaginary line connecting the bottom of the horns (Figure 12) , which places the shot in a similar loca - tion to recommendations for mature cattle. Ideally, the angle of entry should be perpendicular to the skull. If it is necessary to shoot the animal from a dis -tance, targets may be the head (frontal or lateral side) or the thorax (heart shot).137 Euthanasia of water buffalo \u2014There are impor - tant anatomic differences that need to be considered when determining the best method of euthanasia for water buffalo, compared with cattle. Skull bones are substantially thicker and the frontal and paranasal sinuses noticeably wider in buffalo, compared with cattle. Moreover, measures of the median distance from the frontal skin surface to the thalamus were 144.8 mm (117.1 to 172.0 mm) vs 102.0 (101.0 to 121.0 mm) in water buffalo and cattle, respectively.138 Bolt length of conventional captive bolt devices is 9 to 12 cm (3.5 to 4.7 inches), meaning that the ability of the bolt to make direct contact with the thalamus and brainstem is less likely using frontal sites in water buf - falo, compared with cattle. For this reason, use of the PCB at frontal sites in water buffalo is generally less effective. Considering the thicker skin and skull encoun - tered with water buffalo, the use of a high-caliber firearm is the preferred method of euthanasia under field conditions. In the study by Scwhenk et al,138 the frontal point of entry for captive bolt guns was chosen as the intersection of 2 imaginary lines con - necting the lower edge to the upper edge of the con - tralateral horn (Figure 13) . This site would appear to be similar to sites described in the guidelines for domestic cattle. Depth of concussion was evaluated in 30 water buffalo shot at the poll (described as the back of the head) with a PCB.139 Prevalence of a shallow depth of concussion was observed in 53% of animals. In 2 of the animals studied, the bolt missed the brain completely and entered the spinal cord. In 1 case, the bolt failed to penetrate into the brain. On postmor - tem examination of the brain, 79% of animals were shot in the midbrain or brainstem. One animal, an older bull, was shot in the frontal position but failed to collapse. On postmortem examination, research - ers confirmed that the bolt never penetrated into the cranial cavity of this animal. Three animals shot in the crown position (ie, the top of the head\u2014some - times referred to as the poll) immediately collapsed, but 2 resumed breathing shortly before ejection from the stunning pen and had to be reshot. Researchers concluded that poll position stunning could be effec - tive in water buffalo, but accurate placement of the PCB was important to prevent misdirection into the spinal cord, and animals need to be exsanguinated soon after they have lost consciousness. S3.2.1.3 Adjunctive methods S3.2.1.3.1 Noninhaled agents Potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate \u2014 Bolusing saturated solutions of salt through the heart disrupts electrical conductivity in heart muscle, re - sulting in fibrillation and heart failure. Animals must be unconscious before administration of potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate. While not acceptable as a sole method of euthanasia, rapid IV injection of 68 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONpotassium chloride may assist in ensuring death af - ter cattle have been rendered unconscious by PCB, gunshot, or administration of general anesthetics ( 2- adrenergic agents such as xylazine alone are insuf - ficient; see comments under Unacceptable methods). Normally, injection of 120 to 250 mL of a saturated solution of potassium chloride is sufficient to cause death; however, the potassium chloride solution should be administered until death is assured. When conducting euthanasia of cattle that may require subsequent administration of potassium chloride, the operator should prepare at least 3 to four 60-mL syringes of solution (equipped with 14- or 16-gauge needles) in advance. This will facilitate rapid admin - istration and ensure the animal does not regain con - sciousness. Any available vein may be used; however, it is important to position oneself out of the reach of limbs and hooves that may cause injury during pe - riods of involuntary movement. In most cases, it is safest to kneel down near the animal's back and close to the animal's head where one can reach over the neck to administer the injection into the jugular vein. Once the needle is in the vein, the injection should be delivered rapidly. Magnesium sulfate may be administered similarly to potassium chloride. Death may not occur as rap - idly, but similar to administration of potassium chlo - ride, residue risks for predators and scavengers are low (see Noninhaled Agents). S3.2.1.3.2 Physical methods Second shot \u2014Although 1 well-placed bullet or shot from a PCB usually results in immediate loss of consciousness with little likelihood of return to con - sciousness, one should always be prepared to deliver a second or even a third shot if necessary. The ad - ditional injury to brain tissue along with increased hemorrhage and edema creates substantial intracra - nial pressure. Compression resulting from this in - crease in pressure interrupts centers in the brain that control respiratory and cardiac functions and leads to death. Exsanguination\u2014 Exsanguination may be per - formed as an adjunctive measure to ensure death when necessary in an unconscious animal. Exsan - guination is usually accomplished via an incision of the ventral aspect of the throat or neck transecting skin, muscle, trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, and a multitude of sensory and motor nerves and other vessels. This procedure is not rec - ommended as a sole method of euthanasia; rather it is reserved for use as an adjunctive method to ensure death since information in the literature is inconsis - tent as to length of time between the neck cut and loss of consciousness. Some studies140,141 demonstrate a rapid loss of brain activity (measured by EEG) with little variation between individual animals. In con - trast, direct observation of time to collapse and EEG data indicate that the time from ventral-neck incision to unconsciousness is variable and may be quite pro - longed in animals killed by exsanguination.142-146The uncertainty of time from the neck incision to loss of consciousness raises obvious questions: Does the animal feel pain during the neck cut? Does the drop in blood pressure cause discomfort or dis - tress? Opinions on these questions remain divided. Some hold the view that when the knife ( sakin in Hebrew) is of appropriate size, exceptionally sharp, completely free of blemishes or imperfections, and used in such manner as to create a rapid clean inci - sion (such as performed by a shochet), exsanguina - tion is relatively painless.147 Others contend that tis - sues of the neck are well innervated with nociceptive nerve fibers such that transection leads to significant pain and distress sufficient to cause shock at the time of incision.148-150 In recognition that this issue remains controver - sial and that people conducting these procedures for the purposes of euthanasia are not likely to have a sakin or the skills of a shochet, the recommendation is that exsanguination only be used in unconscious animals as an adjunctive method to assure death. It should be performed with a pointed, very sharp knife with a rigid blade at least 15 cm (6 inches) long and conducted as soon as the loss of consciousness is con - firmed. Exsanguination can be disturbing to observe due to the large volume of blood loss; this also raises bi - osecurity concerns. When only the carotid arteries and jugular veins are cut, bleeding may persist at variable rates for several minutes. Severing these ves - sels closer to the thoracic inlet where the vessels are larger will increase blood flow rate. Some evidence suggests that restricted blood flow may be caused by the formation of false aneurysms in the severed ends of arteries in cattle.146 Pithing\u2014 Pithing is a technique designed to cause death by increasing destruction of brain and spinal cord tissue. It is performed by inserting a pithing rod through the entry site produced in the skull by a bul - let or PCB. The operator manipulates the pithing tool to destroy brainstem and spinal cord tissue to ensure death (see Physical Methods). Muscular activity dur - ing the pithing process is often quite violent, but is followed by quiescence that facilitates exsanguina - tion or other procedures.151 S3.2.1.4 Special cases and exceptions In emergency situations, it may be difficult or im - possible to safely restrain a dangerous animal for IV injection, and administration of a sedative to allow restraint might not be desirable because of the possi - bility that the animal could injure itself or bystanders before the sedative could take effect. In such cases, a neuromuscular blocking agent (eg, succinylcholine) may be administered IM, but the bovid must be eu - thanized via an appropriate method as soon as it can be controlled. Use of succinylcholine alone or with - out prior anesthesia is not acceptable for euthanasia. Use of the poll (bony protuberance on the top of the skull) for application of the PCB in abattoirs is not allowed by regulations in the European Union AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 69because the depth of concussion in this region is less than that observed in frontal sites.152 Conversely, for large bulls and water buffalo, use of the frontal site for administration of a captive bolt is not always ef - fective because of the thickness of the hide and skull in this region. Use of the poll position can be effec - tive if the appropriate captive bolt gun is used and when the muzzle is directed so that the discharged bolt will enter the brain.152 But in most cases the poll position is not preferred. Research has demonstrated that use of PCB at the poll is prone to operator error and misdirection of the bolt into the spinal cord in - stead of the brain.152 More animals were not properly rendered unconscious (ie, depth of concussion was shallow) using the poll position as compared with frontal sites. Additionally, in some emergency situa - tions, when the face is not safely accessible, a shot directed from just behind the poll and aimed toward the base of the tongue may be employed. This posi - tioning should not be routine. Placement of the captive bolt is critical to en - sure that the bolt enters the brain and not the spinal cord. Shots from the poll should be directed toward the base of the tongue unless brainstem tissues are needed for diagnostic reasons. Whether poll shooting is conducted by PCB or gunshot, there is substantial potential for misdirection of the bullet or bolt so that damage to the brain to achieve unconsciousness or death is not assured. This will result in delays in loss of consciousness and a greater likelihood of variable periods of extreme distress. S3.2.2 smAll RumInAnts Euthanasia of small ruminants may be necessary for reasons ranging from traumatic injury to incur - able disease. Methods include barbiturate overdose, gunshot, or captive bolt followed by an adjunctive method such as exsanguination, IV administration of potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate, or pith - ing. Electrocution is another option, but this method requires specialized equipment to restrain the ani - mal for proper placement of the electrodes. Because electricity and the necessary equipment are unlikely to be available for euthanasia under field conditions, electrocution is not considered to be practical for routine use. S3.2.2.1 Acceptable methods S3.2.2.1.1 Noninhaled agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Barbiturates act by depression of the CNS, which pro - gresses from a state of consciousness to unconscious - ness, deep anesthesia, and eventually death. Although use of these agents requires restraint and involves mild discomfort (ie, needle placement) for administration, observers generally find this a more acceptable meth - od of euthanasia because death comes about more peacefully. In the companion animal setting, these at - tributes are highly desirable. In production settings, concerns for cost and disposal of animal remains make this method a less attractive euthanasia option.S3.2.2.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S3.2.2.1.1 Inhaled agents Carbon dioxide inhalation as a form of euthana - sia has been evaluated in young goat kids ( < 3 weeks of age). Aversion testing suggests that concentra - tions below 70% CO2 are not aversive to goat kids, as they were willing to freely enter a test chamber containing up to 70% concentration to receive a milk meal. All kids entering the chamber of 70% CO2 lost consciousness while consuming the meal. Based on these data and clinical experience it is recommend - ed that once kids are placed in a euthanasia cham - ber it should be filled at a rate sufficient to achieve a CO2 concentration of > 70% by 5 minutes and to use a dwell time of 10 minutes to assure euthanasia. Euthanasia by CO2 inhalation has not been evaluated in older goats or sheep. Given that aversion to CO2 is variable by species and that physiologic differences in age and weight could affect success, the suitability of this form of euthanasia in other ruminant species warrants further investigation but cannot currently be recommended due to a lack of knowledge.153,154 S3.2.2.2.2 Physical methods Gunshot \u2014Firearms recommended for euthana - sia of adult small ruminants include the .22 LR rifle; .38 Special, .357 Magnum, and 9 mm or equivalent handguns; and shotguns. Some prefer hollow-point bullets to increase brain destruction and reduce the chance of ricochet. However, operators are re - minded that bullet fragmentation may substantially reduce the potential for brain destruction because of reduced penetration, particularly when used in large-horned adult rams. Shotguns or higher-caliber firearms loaded with solid-point bullets are preferred in these conditions. When firearms are used for eu - thanasia it is important that the gun never be held flush with the skull. Instead, the muzzle of the gun should be aimed in the desired direction and held no closer than 6 to 12 inches from the target. PCB and NPCB \u2014Effective application of the cap - tive bolt in sheep and goats is indicated by immediate loss of consciousness lasting until death by exsangui - nation or another adjunctive method. While it is pre - sumed that penetration of the bolt causes insensibili - ty, research into the determinants of effective captive bolt use indicates that the impact of the bolt on the cranium is a principal contributor to the loss of con - sciousness.131 The use of concussive methods (NPCB) has been determined to be an effective means of in - ducing insensibility in neonatal goats and kids that will persist until death caused by exsanguination.132 Anatomic landmarks for gunshot and captive bolts \u2014The location for placement of a captive bolt or entry of a free bullet for euthanasia is similar for both sheep and goats. The optimal site is on the intersec - tion of 2 lines, each of which is drawn from the later - al canthus of one eye to the middle of the base of the opposite ear (Figures 14AB, 15AB) .155,156 Alterna - tive landmarks that provide a very similar placement use the dorsal midline of the head at the level of the 70 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONexternal occipital protuberance aiming downward toward the cranialmost portion of the intermandibu - lar space.157 Frontal shots, aiming at the foramen mag - num, should be reserved for use only with gunshot and provide an alternate approach for heavily horned sheep and goats where the top of the skull may be too hard to access due to the horns. The large and variable sinus cavity of sheep and goats makes frontal shots with a captive bolt more inconsistent.136 Camelids \u2014The effectiveness of PCB was studied in 96 alpacas. Incorrect placement of the captive bolt resulted in incomplete concussion and the failure of 10 animals to be rendered insensitive. Researchers evaluated 2 anatomic sites: a frontal and a crown site. The frontal site was defined as on the intersection of 2 lines drawn from the medial canthus of each eye to the opposite ear while aiming the PCB at the brain - stem. This site proved to be less effective because ani - mals would move their head as the PCB entered their field of view immediately prior to the shot. Placement of the PCB at the crown position (ie, highest point on the head) aiming downward to the base of the jaw (Figure 16) was more likely to result in an immediate loss of consciousness and cause damage to the thala - mus and brainstem. While both landmarks are con - sidered acceptable for captive bolt placement, if the frontal site is used increased restraint of the animal may be required to prevent movement that would re - sult in incorrect placement. Cervids \u2014For euthanasia of captive farmed cer - vids, several options exist. For animals accustomed to being worked through drop chutes, the animals can be restrained in a drop chute and shot with a captive bolt. For deer without antlers, the proper site for en - try of a bolt from a PCB is the same as that described for goats and sheep previously\u2014on the intersection of 2 lines drawn from the lateral canthus to the base or top of the opposite ear. For antlered deer (bucks), a frontal site may be necessary, but may require a lon - ger bolt length. The frontal site may be determined as on the intersection of 2 lines drawn from the lat - eral canthus of each eye to the top of the base of the ear or base of the antler (Figure 17AB) . When drop chutes are not available or when the animals are not accustomed to being restrained in the chute, it may be beneficial to consider darting the animal with an anesthetic followed by use of a captive bolt or firearm at the sites discussed previously. When immobiliza - tion is feasible, it ensures accurate shot placement and minimizes the risk of a prolonged euthanasia. Im - mobilized animals (either chemically immobilized or immobilized from injury such as being hit by a car) should always be euthanized with a PCB or firearm via the sites discussed above. Shooting in the thorax or so-called center mass should be avoided. In situa - tions where the ability to sufficiently immobilize frac - tious animals is not available or immobilization poses a significant risk to human health, killing by trained shooters using specialized equipment can be highly effective.S3.2.2.3 Adjunctive methods S3.2.2.3.1 Noninhaled agents Potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate \u2014 Although not acceptable as a sole method of eutha - nasia, the rapid IV injection of potassium chloride is an effective method to ensure death in sheep and goats previously rendered unconscious by penetrat - ing or NPCB, gunshot, or administration of anesthet - ics. When conducting euthanasia of sheep and goats that may require subsequent administration of potas - sium chloride, the operator should prepare at least 1 or two 30-mL syringes of solution (equipped with an 18-gauge needle) in advance. This will facilitate rapid administration and ensure the animal does not regain consciousness. Any available vein may be used; however, it is important to position oneself out of the reach of limbs and hooves that may cause in - jury during periods of involuntary movement. Once the needle is in the vein, the injection should be de - livered rapidly. Magnesium sulfate may be administered similarly to potassium chloride. Death may not occur as rap - idly, but similar to administration of potassium chlo - ride, residue risks for predators and scavengers are low (see Noninhaled Agents). S3.2.2.3.2 Physical methods Second shot \u2014Although 1 well-placed bullet or shot from a PCB usually results in immediate loss of consciousness with little likelihood of return to con - sciousness, one should always be prepared to deliver a second or even a third shot if necessary. The additional injury to brain tissue along with increased hemorrhage and edema creates sufficient intracranial pressure to cause death in most cases, but damage to the brain - stem should always be the objective in euthanasia. Exsanguination\u2014 Exsanguination may be per - formed as an adjunctive step to ensure death when necessary in small ruminants. It may be accomplished via an incision of the ventral aspect of the throat or neck transecting skin, muscle, trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, and jugular veins. Exsanguination should be performed with a pointed, very sharp knife with a rigid blade at least 15 cm (6 inches) long. Exsanguination can be disturbing for bystand - ers because of the large volume of blood loss, which also raises biosecurity concerns. When only the ca - rotid arteries and jugular veins are cut, bleeding may persist at variable rates for several minutes. Severing these vessels closer to the thoracic inlet where the vessels are larger will increase blood flow rate. Pithing\u2014 Pithing is a technique designed to cause death by increasing destruction of brain and spinal cord tissue. It is performed by inserting a pithing rod through the entry site produced in the skull by a bul - let or PCB. The operator manipulates the pithing tool to destroy brainstem and spinal cord tissue to ensure death (see Physical Methods). Muscular activity dur - ing the pithing process is often quite violent, but is followed by quiescence that facilitates exsanguina - tion or other procedures.151 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 71S3.2.3 unACC eptABle methods The following methods are unacceptable for eu - thanasia of cattle and small ruminants: manually ap - plied blunt trauma to the head; injection of chemi - cal agents into conscious animals (eg, disinfectants, electrolytes such as potassium chloride and magne - sium sulfate, nonanesthetic pharmaceutical agents); administration of xylazine or any other 2-adrenergic receptor agonist followed by IV potassium chlo - ride or magnesium sulfate (although large doses of 2-adrenergic receptor agonists can produce a state resembling general anesthesia, they are recognized as being unreliable for that purpose158), drowning, or air embolism (ie, injection of air into the vascula - ture); and electrocution with 120 V, drowning, and exsanguination in conscious animals. Camelids, specifically alpacas and llamas, are kept primarily for fiber production and as pets. In South America, domestic camelids are maintained for food and as pack animals. Camelids are slaughtered by the method of puntilla, which involves inserting a knife into the back of the neck to sever the spinal cord. This immobilizes the animal, making exsanguination procedures safer154; however, research in llamas and cattle indicates that the stab is often ineffective in causing insensibility.159,160 Observations in 20 llamas killed by puntilla found that repeated stabbing was necessary to penetrate the foramen ovale; all animals exhibited rhythmic breathing and 95% had positive palpebral reflexes.159 Because of the inconsistency of the puntilla method, it cannot be recommended as an acceptable method of euthanasia of small ruminants or cattle. S3.2.4 neon Ates Neonatal calves, lambs, and kids \u2014Neonatal calves present special challenges for euthanasia. Methods include barbiturate overdose, gunshot, and captive bolt (penetrating or nonpenetrating) with an adjunctive method applied to ensure death. Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head is not accept - able for calves because their skulls are too hard to achieve immediate destruction of brain tissue lead - ing to unconsciousness and death. In lambs and kids, manually applied blunt force trauma is performed by manual impact of the head by swinging the animal against a hard surface or hitting the animal with a hard object such as a hammer. Both methods are diffi - cult if not impossible to apply consistently and there - fore are listed as unacceptable. Use of a penetrating or purpose-built NPCB (con - trolled blunt force trauma) is acceptable with con - ditions for calves, lambs, and kids. Controlled blunt force trauma differs from manually applied blunt force trauma because captive bolts deliver an appro - priate and uniform amount of force each time they are fired, and structural brain damage is more con - sistent. Studies161 using controlled blunt force trauma methods found that focal as well as diffuse injury caused by penetrating and NPCB pistols was similar and sufficient for both to be considered as effective for euthanasia of lambs. Based on electrophysiologic evidence,131 researchers determined that the primary determinant of effective shooting is the impact of the bolt and not penetration of the bolt into brain tissues. In contrast, 1 report162 credits structural changes in - cluding focal damage adjacent to the wound track and damage to peripheral tissues of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem as the predominant fac - tors affecting the loss of respiratory function and con - sciousness. Controlled blunt force trauma using an NPCB applies a consistent degree of force and has been determined to cause immediate insensibility in neo - natal calves,154 lambs,163 and kids.164,165 The preferred anatomic site in calves is similar to that described for mature cattle. The preferred shooting position for neonatal lambs and kids is to place the muzzle of the NPCB on the midline behind the poll (ie, between the ears) with the chin tucked into the neck (Figure 18).164,165 In the study by Sutherland et al,164 a pro - pane-powered NPCB capable of delivering 27.8 J of energy was used as the euthanasia device. In the stud - ies by Grist et al,163,165 researchers used the Accles and Shelvoke CASH Small Animal Killer (CPK 200) pow - ered by a 1- or 1.25-grain cartridge. Barbiturate overdose may be used for euthanasia of neonatal calves, lambs, and kids. In noncommercial situations, this method may be preferred over physi - cal methods. Drawbacks include temporary animal distress associated with restraint and needle place - ment, challenges associated with disposal of remains (residue concerns), and the requirement that only personnel registered with the US DEA may perform the procedure. Assuming these conditions can be met, barbiturate overdose is generally less objection - able to owners and observers than other methods. S3.2.5 dAms And fetuses Prerequisites for the sensation of pain, distress, or pleasurable experiences are sentience and con - sciousness. Both are necessary for animals to experi - ence either positive or negative states. Behavioral and EEG evidence indicates that mammalian fetuses are insentient and unconscious throughout the first 75% to 80% of gestation.23 As neuronal pathways between the cerebral cortex and thalamus become better established, the fetus develops the capacity for sen - tience. However, while maintained within the pro - tected environment of the animal's uterus it remains in an unconscious state due to the presence of 8 or more neuroinhibitors that act on the cerebral cortex of the fetus to maintain it in the sleep-like state of un - consciousness. At birth, the combined effects of re - duced neuroinhibition and onset of neuroactivation contribute to gradual arousal of the mammalian new - born into a state of consciousness that occurs within minutes to several hours after birth.23 These observations indicate that the fetus does not suffer as if drowning in amniotic fluid when the 72 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONdam is euthanized; nor is it likely to experience pain associated with other types of invasive procedures in utero. These studies also support the rationale for in - ternational guidelines on the handling of fetuses sug - gesting that fetuses should not be removed from the uterus before the EEG is most likely to be isoelectric. For example, when animals are euthanized by physi - cal methods that include exsanguination, delaying removal of the fetus from the uterus for a minimum of 5 minutes after hemorrhaging has ceased generally assures a substantial amount of anoxia-induced dam - age to the cerebral cortex that will normally prevent progression toward a return to sensibility.166 If there is any doubt as to the fetus's level of consciousness, it should be euthanized immediately by captive bolt and adjunctive methods as appropriate. It also addresses the welfare concerns of those who fear that the collection of tissues (in particular, fetal calf blood by intracardiac puncture) from live fetuses in the immediate postslaughter period cre - ates undue suffering. Although the heart may con - tinue to beat (which is necessary for the successful collection of fetal blood), in the absence of breathing there is little likelihood of return to a state of con - sciousness.166 Breathing can be prevented by clamp - ing off the fetus's trachea or by delaying its removal from the uterus for 15 to 20 minutes after death of the dam.166 These are by no means insignificant concerns as there is high demand for fetal tissues to support laboratory research. A 2002 report167 suggests that world demand for fetal calf serum was 500,000 L/y and growing, a need that would require the harvest of at least 1,000,000 fetuses/y. The information derived from these observations also has application for fetal rescue situations that may involve euthanasia of late-term pregnant dams by physical methods. The reason one might attempt this is to avoid remains-disposal complications from drug residues as would occur if the fetus were to be delivered by caesarian section using standard surgi - cal methods. Although respiration is interrupted, the heart continues to beat in animals rendered uncon - scious using physical methods. Therefore, it may be possible to rescue a fetus from an unconscious dam by caesarian section if the procedure can be per - formed before the fetus suffers irreversible effects of anoxia. Once the fetus is successfully delivered, euthanasia of the dam may be confirmed via any of the previously described adjunctive methods. It is important to understand that there are significant risks to fetal welfare if rescue is attempted. Welfare complications associated with fetal rescue attempts would include impaired brain function caused by an - oxia occurring during the rescue attempt, compro - mised respiratory function and body heat produc - tion resulting from fetal immaturity, and greater risk of infection as a consequence of failure of passive transfer of immunity.23,168,169 When the value of the fetus justifies the effort to secure a successful live de - livery, the preferred approach to assure fetal health and welfare is by caesarian section using standard surgical procedures. Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Pentobarbital readily crosses the placenta resulting in fetal depression in pregnant animals. However, death of the dam normally precedes the death of the fetus. In 1 study170 cardiac arrest in lambs was delayed for as long as 25 minutes beyond the death of the dam. Similar observations in mice demonstrated that death of the fetuses could only be achieved by the use of doses well in excess of those normally required for euthanasia.171 Based on these observations, one could offer a similar recommendation to that provided pre - viously for death by exsanguination whereby fetuses should be retained within the uterus for at least 15 to 20 minutes after maternal death has occurred to prevent the delivery of viable fetuses. S3.3 SWINE Methods of euthanasia commonly applied to swine include CO2, gunshot, captive bolt, overdose of an anesthetic administered by a veterinarian, elec - trocution, and blunt force trauma (suckling piglets only). Gas mixtures of N2O, Ar, N2, and CO2 may also be used but are not currently commonly applied in the field. Selection of the most appropriate method for each situation is dependent upon size and weight of the animal, availability of equipment and facili - ties, operator skill and experience with the proce - dure, aesthetic concerns, human safety, and options for disposal of remains. Certain physical methods of euthanasia may require adjunctive methods such as exsanguination or pithing to ensure death. A brief de - scription of each method and appropriate candidates for it are described. Detailed information on inhaled, noninhaled, and physical methods of euthanasia may be found in the respective sections of this document. S3.3.1 sows, BoARs, And gRowe R-fInIshe R pIgs Methods usually used for euthanasia of sows, boars, and grower-finisher pigs include gunshot, PCB, electrocution, and barbiturate overdose. Use of physical methods of euthanasia requires direct contact with the animal, and therefore restraint is necessary. Use of a snare is the most common form of restraint for this class of swine. Studies172-179 dem - onstrate varying degrees of stress associated with restraint by snaring techniques. To minimize stress associated with snaring, personnel conducting eutha - nasia of swine are advised to make advance prepara - tions (eg, prepare the site, load the gun or captive bolt) so that the time during which the animal must be restrained is minimized. S3.3.1.1 Acceptable methods S3.3.1.1.1 Noninhaled agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Mature sows, boars, and grower-finisher pigs may be euthanized by IV administration of euthanasia solu - tions containing barbiturates.180 A dosage of 1 mL/5 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 73kg (0.45 mL/2.3 lb) up to 30 kg (66 lb), then 1 mL/10 kg (0.45 mL/4.5 lb) thereafter, has been recommend - ed.181 This method may not cause death if not admin - istered IV. Other anesthetics (gas and/or injectable) may be used to induce unconsciousness, followed by an adjunctive method such as exsanguination. These are not commonly used in field conditions, but may be applicable in some settings. Because these drugs are controlled substances they must be administered by personnel who are registered with the US DEA. Strict record keeping is required of all who use and store these drugs. Some may find euthanasia by the IV administra - tion of an anesthetic less aesthetically displeasing than gunshot, captive bolt, or electrocution. Options for disposal of animals euthanized with barbiturates are complicated by concerns for residues that create risks for scavengers and other domesticated animals that may consume portions of the animal's remains, and renderers may not accept animal remains con - taminated with barbiturate residues. S3.3.1.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S3.3.1.2.1 Inhaled agents Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and argon \u2014Studied gas mixtures include N2 with CO2; Ar, alone and with CO2; and CO. Inhaled agents are most commonly used as a method of euthanasia in packing plant venues, and are considered to be ac - ceptable with conditions. However, they are typical - ly not practical in farm situations, and have greater application for pigs weighing 70 lb (31.8 kg) or less, rather than grower-finisher pigs or sows and boars. Gas combinations (eg, Ar and CO2, N2O and CO2) have been shown to be effective alternatives to CO2 alone. When the concentration of CO2 is high, ade - quate duration of exposure ensures unconsciousness is followed by death. These methods are described in greater detail for the euthanasia of nursery pigs and in the section on Inhaled Agents. S3.3.1.2.2 Physical methods Gunshot \u2014Gunshot is commonly used for eu - thanasia of growing and adult swine. When properly conducted using the appropriate firearm, euthanasia by gunshot produces immediate loss of conscious - ness and rapid death. There are 3 possible sites for conducting euthanasia in swine: frontal, temporal and from behind the ear toward the opposite eye (Figure 19AB) . The frontal site is in the center of the forehead slightly above a line drawn between the eyes. The projectile should be directed toward the spinal canal. The temporal site is slightly anterior and below the ear. Specific sites may vary slightly accord - ing to breed.124,182,183 Because of the thickness of the pig's skull, muz - zle energies of 400 N-m (300 feet-lb) or more are re - quired for euthanasia of adult sows, boars, and grow - ing-finishing pigs. When the alternate site behind the ear is chosen, a .22 caliber firearm loaded with a solid-point bullet may be used. Wadcutters and frag - menting bullets should not be used for euthanasia of swine. Potential for ricochet is reduced when eutha - nasia by gunshot can be conducted outdoors where bullets that pass through the animal may be captured in an earthen surface. Shotguns may be used at short range and offer the advantage of less potential for bul - let ricochet. Twelve-, 16-, or 20-gauge shotguns are recommended for mature pigs. The muzzle should never be held flush to the skull. When performed correctly, the pig drops to the floor immediately, ex - hibiting varying amounts of tonic and clonic muscle movements. Confirmation that the animal has been rendered insensible includes observing that rhythmic breathing has stopped and that righting reflex is ab - sent, vocalization is absent, and no palpebral reflexes or responses to noxious stimuli are present. All pigs should be observed for evidence of these responses until death has been confirmed. Gunshot is an effective, low-cost method of eu - thanasia when properly performed. Firearms are readily available in most areas. Human safety is the primary concern with the use of gunshot for eutha - nasia. Proper training on firearm safety and use is im - perative and gunshot should only be performed by personnel who have had appropriate training. PCB\u2014Use of well-maintained PCB guns with am - munition appropriately selected for the size of the animal is acceptable with conditions as a method of euthanasia for growing and adult swine.184,185 Proper application of the PCB requires restraint of the ani - mal because the device must be held firmly against the forehead over the site described for gunshot (Fig - ure 19A). When performed correctly, the pig drops to the floor immediately, exhibiting varying amounts of tonic and clonic muscle movements. Confirmation that the animal has been rendered insensible includes observation of the following: rhythmic breathing stops, no righting reflex is observed, vocalization is absent, and no palpebral reflexes or responses to nox - ious stimuli are present. All pigs should be observed for evidence of these responses until death has been confirmed. Death following use of the PCB is commonly achieved, but is not assured depending upon bolt length and depth of the frontal sinus in mature sows and boars. Therefore, secondary steps to ensure death (eg, a second application of the PCB, exsangui - nation, pithing) should be applied as necessary. Breed differences result in variable skull shapes making de - termination of the best anatomic site for conducting euthanasia in mature sows and boars difficult.182 Penetrating captive bolts offer safety advantages compared with firearms. Properly applied, the meth - od is very effective and costs associated with its use are minimal. However, it is important that PCB guns be maintained regularly (cleaning and replacement of worn parts) and that charges be stored properly to ensure appropriate bolt velocity. Bolt length and ammunition requirements for effective single-step euthanasia vary for different sizes and maturities of pigs. Using a captive bolt of insufficient length or 74 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONinsufficient charge reduces effectiveness. Personnel must be trained in the proper use of PCBs to ensure effective euthanasia. Electrocution \u2014Electrocution as a sole method of euthanasia can achieve death via 2-step or single-step processes.186-195 Electrical current must pass through the brain to achieve loss of consciousness, but then must cross the heart to cause fibrillation and cardiac arrest. As a 2-step process, electrode placements are head-head, followed by head to flank, for the appro - priate time. For a single-step process for euthanasia, head to opposite flank is an example of appropriate placement. Head-only electrocution induces a grand mal sei - zure and immediate unconsciousness, but death does not occur unless followed by head-to-heart electro - cution or the application of an adjunctive method to ensure death such as exsanguination.187,196 The sec - ondary step, whether head-to-heart electrocution or another method, must be performed within 15 sec - onds of onset of unconsciousness; otherwise, the animal may regain consciousness. Head-only electro - cution is performed by placement of the electrodes in 1 of 3 positions: between the eyes and base of the ears on either side of the head; below the base of the ears on either side of the head; or diagonally, below 1 ear to above the opposite eye. Placement of electrodes for head-to-heart electrocution is on the head in front of the brain (some use the base of the ear) with a secondary electrode attached to the body behind the heart on the opposite side. This assures diagonal movement of current through the animal's body. With specific electrode placement, current of 110 V at a minimum frequency of 60 Hz applied for a minimum of 3 seconds is sufficient for euthanasia of pigs up to 125 kg.197 Systems used for electrocu - tion must be capable of meeting minimum current requirements to ensure insensibility in the head-only method, and insensibility and cardiac fibrillation in the head-heart method. Electrocution is effective as a single-step process with appropriate tong or clamp placement. However, proper training and special equipment must be used to ensure adequate and safe euthanasia. While elec - trocution is commonly used to render animals in - sensible in packing plants and safety precautions in that environment are routine, for implementation on- farm where use of the method is less common, extra precautions may need to be taken to ensure human safety. Agonal gasping may be evident after current is withdrawn and may be aesthetically unacceptable for observers and operators. S3.3.1.3 Adjunctive methods Exsanguination \u2014While not appropriate as a sole method of euthanasia, exsanguination may be performed as a secondary step to ensure death when necessary. Pithing \u2014While not appropriate as a sole method of euthanasia, pithing may be performed as a second - ary step to ensure death when necessary.More information about these methods is avail - able in the Physical Methods section of the Guide - lines. S3.3.2 nuRseRy pIgs (70 lB oR lIghte R) Nursery pigs may be euthanized by use of inhaled gases (eg CO, CO2, N2), gunshot, PCB, NPCB, Descriptions of the use of CO2 and NPCB for euthanasia of young pigs follow. For details on other methods please see the preceding information in this section or the Phys - ical Methods section of the Guidelines. S3.3.2.1 Acceptable methods S3.3.2.1.1 Noninhaled agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Nursery pigs may be euthanized by IV administra - tion of euthanasia solutions containing barbiturates. Because these drugs are controlled substances they must be administered by personnel who are regis - tered with the US DEA. Strict record keeping is re - quired of all who use and store these drugs. Many find euthanasia by the IV administration of an anesthetic less aesthetically displeasing than ad - ministration of CO2, captive bolt, or electrocution. Options for disposal of animals euthanized with bar - biturates are complicated by concerns for residues that create risks for scavengers and other domesticat - ed animals that may consume portions of the animal's remains. S3.3.2.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S3.3.2.2.1 Inhaled agents Carbon dioxide \u2014Carbon dioxide alone or in combination with N2O or Ar has been used success - fully for euthanasia.198-202,c Properly applied, inhala - tion of CO2 is an effective method of euthanasia. On the other hand, if air exchange rates are not carefully controlled and monitored, animals may suffer sub - stantial stress from suffocation prior to loss of con - sciousness and death (see Inhaled Agents section of Guidelines). Conducting this procedure on small pigs requires a container large enough for the size and number of pigs to be euthanized. Pigs may be exposed to CO2 by gradually displacing ambient gases (introducing CO2 into the container) or by introducing the animals into a prefilled environment. In the gradual-fill approach, pigs are placed in an enclosed container and CO2 flow is initiated at a rate and for a time to reach a level suf - ficient to achieve euthanasia. In the prefill approach, a concentrated environment of CO2 is created, pigs are placed in that environment, and CO2 flow is re - sumed to maintain effective euthanasia concentra - tions. In both methods, exposure of pigs with normal respiration to a constant supply of 80% to 90% CO2 for a minimum of 5 minutes is necessary for effective euthanasia.203-212 Carbon dioxide offers advantages for euthanasia, including that it is relatively inexpensive, nonflam - mable and nonexplosive, and clean (no blood loss). Drawbacks to the use of CO2 are that it requires spe - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 75cial equipment and training for efficient and safe ap - plication. Systems must be able to achieve a level of anesthesia while not causing hypothermia. An appro - priate pressure-reducing regulator, with or without a flow meter, capable of generating the recommended displacement rates for the size container being uti - lized is necessary. As with other methods, death must be verified for each animal following administration of CO2.182 For young pigs, movement during the induction phase has caused some to question the degree of stress that may be induced with this method. Some interpret these movements as indications of aversion. There is evidence that such reactions may be normal for pigs in an unconscious state.204,209,210 Small or in - capacitated piglets have low tidal volumes and will not achieve death as rapidly as larger, more viable pigs. Carbon dioxide euthanasia in chamber settings has not been extensively studied for larger pigs. Mey - er and Morrow213 recommend that chamber volume be exchanged at least 2.5 times to accommodate the wash-in-wash-out principle regardless of the size of swine to be euthanized. Monitoring of equipment and gas must be routine and consistent to ensure there is always sufficient gas to accomplish the objective of euthanasia. Carbon dioxide containers should never be placed in an unventilated area due to risks associ - ated with an overdose of gaseous S3.3.2.2.2 Physical methods NPCB \u2014A purpose-built NPCB may be used for euthanasia of young pigs. The concussive impact of the bolt induces an immediate loss of conscious - ness that when followed by an adjunctive method to ensure death meets the criteria for euthanasia. The NPCB works best in younger pigs before the frontal bones are fully developed and hardened. Use of a proper functioning NPCB with appropri - ate charges offers the advantage of delivering a uni - form concussive force to the skull (controlled blunt force trauma). This reduces the potential for ineffec - tive stunning and euthanasia that may occur more often with the use of manually applied blunt force trauma. However, this method requires immediate application of an adjunctive method to ensure eutha - nasia.214 PCB\u2014Use of well-maintained PCB guns with am - munition appropriately selected for the size of the animal is acceptable with conditions as a method of euthanasia for growing and adult swine.184,185 Proper application of the PCB requires restraint of the ani - mal because the device must be held firmly against the forehead over the site described for gunshot (Fig - ure 12). When performed correctly, the pig drops to the floor immediately, exhibiting varying amounts of tonic and clonic muscle movements. Confirma - tion that the animal has been rendered insensible includes observing that rhythmic breathing stops, righting reflex is absent, vocalization is absent, and no palpebral reflexes or responses to noxious stimuli are present. All pigs should be observed for evidence of these responses until death has been confirmed. For more information, see the section on grow-finish swine earlier in the Guidelines. Electrocution \u2014Electrocution is acceptable with conditions for swine over 3 days of age.214 Details are provided earlier in this section and in the Physical Methods section of the Guidelines. S3.3.3 suCklIng pIgs Options for the euthanasia of suckling pigs in - clude CO2; mixtures of 3 days of age]); anesthetic over - dose; and blunt force trauma. Described in detail are the application of NPCB, manually applied blunt force trauma, and CO2. See previous sections of the Guidelines for more detailed information on the ap - plication of other euthanasia techniques. S3.3.3.1 Acceptable methods S3.3.3.1.1 Injectable agents Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Suckling pigs may be euthanized by IV administra - tion of euthanasia solutions containing barbiturates. Because these drugs are controlled substances they must be administered by personnel who are regis - tered with the US DEA. Strict record keeping is re - quired of all who use and store these drugs. Many find euthanasia by the IV administration of an anesthetic less aesthetically displeasing than ad - ministration of CO2, captive bolt, manually applied blunt force trauma, or electrocution. Disposal of ani - mals euthanized with barbiturates is complicated by concerns about residues that create risks for scaven - gers and other domesticated animals that may con - sume portions of the animal's remains. S3.3.3.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S3.3.3.2.1 Inhaled agents Carbon dioxide \u2014Carbon dioxide may be effec - tive as a method of euthanasia for small groups of neonatal piglets214; however, the parameters of the technique need to be optimized and published to en - sure consistency and repeatability. S3.3.3.2.2 Physical methods NPCB \u2014The NPCB can be an effective method of euthanasia for young piglets.215,216 Loss of conscious - ness and death are caused by a severe nonpenetrating concussive force applied to the forehead of the piglet. The utility of the NPCB is focused on the unique con - dition in suckling and young pigs where the frontal bones are not fully developed, leaving the brain sus - ceptible to blunt, high-velocity impact. When used in appropriately sized and aged pigs a secondary step to ensure death is unnecessary.217,218 The NPCB can be powered pneumatically or through the use of appropriate ammunition. Some brands of captive bolt guns have been made versatile by provid - ing different heads (varying length of bolt and pen - etrating or nonpenetrating end), and ammunition for various-size pigs, which allows the same gun to be used in different situations. Current research indi -76 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONcates that euthanasia using an NPCB is effective and repeatable with sufficient power, ammunition, and consistency in the gun design.215,216 Manually applied blunt force trauma \u2014Manu - ally applied blunt force trauma, when performed correctly, meets the definition of euthanasia, namely causing minimal distress with rapid loss of conscious - ness leading to death. As with the NPCB, the utility of manually applied blunt force trauma is focused on the unique condition in suckling and young pigs where the frontal bones are not fully developed, leaving the brain susceptible to blunt, high-velocity impact. This method may be less aesthetically acceptable than other alternatives, but when performed with proper training and proper application of technique, death is rapid. Uncertainty of success often causes repeated application or selection of an alternative euthanasia method.216 The AVMA encourages those using manu - ally applied blunt force trauma to the head as a eu - thanasia method to actively search for alternatives to ensure that criteria for euthanasia can be consistently met. S3.4 POULTRY Euthanasia methods for poultry (domesticated birds used for egg, meat, or feather production [eg, chickens, turkeys, quail, pheasants, ducks, geese]) include gas inhalation, manually applied blunt force trauma, cervical dislocation, decapitation, electro - cution, gunshot, captive bolt, and injectable agents. Where appropriate, additional comments are includ - ed to address physiologic differences among avian species, variations in environment, and the size or age of birds. S3.4.1 ACCeptABle methods S3.4.1.1 Noninhaled agents Overdoses of injectable anesthetics, including barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives \u2014Poul - try may be euthanized by IV injection of overdoses of anesthetics, including barbiturate and barbituric acid derivatives. Because these drugs are controlled sub - stances they must be administered by personnel who are registered with the US DEA. Strict record keeping is required of all who use and store these drugs. Many find administration of an anesthetic less displeasing than administration of CO2, CO, captive bolt, manually applied blunt force trauma, or electro - cution. Therefore, it may be preferred in some set - tings. A disadvantage of this method is that tissues from animals euthanized with barbiturates may not be used for food and may not be suitable for diag - nostic evaluation. Furthermore, options for disposal of animals euthanized with barbiturates are compli - cated by concerns for residues that create risks for scavengers and other domesticated animals that may consume portions of the animal's remains.S3.4.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S3.4.2.1 Inhaled gases Inhaled gases may be used satisfactorily for eu - thanasia of poultry, and detailed information about the various types of inhaled gases is available in the Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines. When in - haled gases are used for euthanasia, birds should be checked to verify death because they may appear dead but, depending on the agent, can regain con - sciousness if the exposure time or the concentration of the agent is insufficient. Gases must be supplied in purified forms without contaminants or adulter - ants, typically from a commercially supplied cylinder or tank. The gas-dispensing system should have suf - ficient capacity and control to maintain the necessary gas concentrations in the container being utilized, and the container itself should be sufficiently airtight to hold the gas at appropriate levels. Carbon dioxide \u2014The most common gas used for euthanasia of poultry is CO2, and its application has been extensively studied for chickens, turkeys, and ducks with information available about behav - ioral responses, times to collapse, unconsciousness, death, loss of somatosensory evoked potentials, loss of visually evoked responses, and changes in EEG and ECG (see Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines). There is no flow rate requirement at this time for the use of carbon dioxide in poultry. Carbon dioxide has successfully been applied for euthanasia of non - hatched eggs (pips), newly hatched poultry in hatch - eries, and adult birds (including routine euthanasia of large commercial laying hen flocks219-221 and on farms keeping birds for research or elite genetics). Because neonatal birds may be more accustomed to high con - centrations of CO2 (incubation environments typi - cally include more CO2), concentrations necessary to achieve rapid euthanasia of pipped eggs or newly hatched chicks may be substantially greater (as high as 80% to 90%) than for adults of the same species. One study222 found that CO2 concentrations needed to be held at 75% or higher for 5 minutes to ensure euthanasia of day-of-hatch chicks. Carbon dioxide may invoke involuntary (uncon - scious) motor activity in birds, such as flapping of the wings or other terminal movements, which can dam - age tissues and be disconcerting for observers.223,224 Slower induction of euthanasia in hypercapnic atmo - spheres reduces the severity of convulsions after loss of consciousness.225,226 Death normally occurs within minutes, depending on the species and the concen - tration of CO2 present in the closed chamber. Carbon monoxide \u2014Carbon monoxide may also be used for euthanasia of poultry. More convulsions may be observed in the presence of CO than nor - mally occur when CO2 is used for euthanasia.227 The CO flow rate should be sufficient to rapidly achieve a uniform concentration of at least 6% after birds are placed in the chamber (see Inhaled Agents section). Only pure, commercially available CO should be AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 77used. The direct application of products of combus - tion or sublimation is not acceptable due to unreli - able or undesirable composition and or displacement rate. Appropriate precautions must be taken to en - sure human safety because CO has a cumulative ef - fect in binding hemoglobin. Due to danger to human safety, carbon monoxide is not recommended for use in most commercial operations. Nitrogen or argon \u2014Nitrogen or Ar, used alone or mixed with approximately 30% CO2, is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of poultry provided the residual atmospheric O2 level can be reduced to and held at sufficiently low levels (eg, 2% to 3%).228- 230 These agents tend to cause more convulsions (eg, wing flapping) than CO2 in air (see Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines).225,231 It has also been not - ed that convulsions may start when consciousness, at least to some degree, may still be a possibility.232,233 Reduction of atmospheric pressure \u2014Reduc - tion of atmospheric pressure by drawing a vacuum in a chamber has been demonstrated to euthanize chicks and mature poultry in a manner comparable to that associated with anoxia-based methods involv - ing inert gases such as N2 or Ar.222,234 The intensity of convulsions after loss of posture (ie, after loss of con - sciousness) is similar to that seen with anoxia-based methods. This method is commonly known as LAPS (low-atmospheric-pressure stunning). S3.4.2.2 Physical methods The following methods are acceptable with con - ditions for euthanasia of poultry. Euthanasia methods should be chosen based on the welfare of the bird, human safety, skill and training of personnel, avail - ability of equipment, and the ability to adequately re - strain the bird. Cervical dislocation\u2014 When performed on con - scious poultry, cervical dislocation must result in luxation of the cervical vertebrae without primary crushing of the vertebrae and spinal cord. Manual or mechanical cervical dislocation may be used for poultry of an appropriate size and species when per - formed by competent personnel who correctly ap - ply the technique. In some classes of poultry there is evidence that cervical dislocation may not cause immediate unconsciousness.235-238 Cervical disloca - tion techniques that cause luxation of the vertebrae at or close to the skull may improve kill success and achieve more rapid reduction of reflexes.239 When performed manually, the shanks of the bird should be grasped (or wings if grasped at the base) and the neck stretched by pulling on the head while apply - ing a ventrodorsal rotational force to the skull until an obvious, typically sudden, reduction of resistance indicates separation of the cervical vertebrae. Separa - tion of the vertebrae should be verified by palpation. Crushing of the cervical vertebrae and spinal cord is not acceptable unless the bird is first rendered un - conscious. Decapitation\u2014 Decapitation is acceptable with conditions for the euthanasia of poultry when per -formed by competent personnel. Decapitation should be executed with a sharp instrument, ensuring rapid and unobstructed severing of the head from the neck. Manually applied blunt force trauma \u2014Euthana - sia by manually applied blunt force trauma to the head is acceptable with conditions for poultry, particularly birds such as turkeys or broiler breeder chickens that are too large for cervical dislocation.240,241 Manually applied blunt force trauma must be correctly applied by competent personnel. Blunt force trauma consist - ing of a single sufficiently strong hit placed in the frontoparietal region of the head resulted in loss of auditory evoked potentials in broilers, broiler breed - ers, and turkeys of up to 16 kg (35.2 lb).241 Fatigue can lead to inconsistency in application, creating concern that the technique may be difficult to apply humanely to large numbers of birds. For this reason, the AVMA encourages those using manually applied blunt force trauma to the head as a euthanasia method to search for alternatives. Electrocution \u2014Electrocution is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of individual birds. Birds subjected to electrocution should be observed to ensure death or an adjunctive method, such as ex - sanguination or cervical dislocation, should be per - formed immediately afterwards to ensure death. A small percentage of birds do not develop ventricular fibrillation even when exposed to high amperage cur - rent. Gunshot \u2014Gunshot is acceptable with condi - tions for free-ranging poultry and ratites when cap - ture or restraint would potentially be highly stressful for the animal or dangerous for humans. Gunshot is not recommended for captive poultry where restraint is feasible. PCB and NPCB \u2014Captive bolts (penetrating or nonpenetrating) are acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of poultry (eg, turkeys, broiler breeders, ratites, waterfowl) when performed by competent personnel (Figures 20-22) . The captive bolt device must be appropriately designed and configured for the species and bird size, provide sufficient impact energy, and be properly applied. The bird should be appropriately restrained to avoid injury to person - nel.135,239,241-243 Birds should be observed following captive bolt administration to ensure that death oc - curs. Any bird showing signs of recovery must re - ceive a second shot or be killed by some other means that is acceptable for a conscious bird. S3.4.3 Adjun CtIve methods Potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate intracardiac administration of potas - sium chloride or magnesium sulfate to a conscious bird as a sole method of euthanasia is unacceptable, it is acceptable to administer these agents to a bird that is fully anesthetized or otherwise unconscious as a means to ensure death. Exsanguination \u2014Although exsanguination of a conscious bird is an unacceptable method of euthana -78 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONsia, it is acceptable to exsanguinate birds that are ful - ly anesthetized or otherwise unconscious as a means to ensure death. Biosecurity precautions during and following exsanguination should be observed as part of appropriate disease response. S3.4.4 emBRyos And neon Ates In addition to methods involving inhaled agents mentioned previously, the following methods are ac - ceptable with conditions for euthanasia of embryos or neonates. Embryonated eggs may be destroyed by pro - longed exposure (20 minutes) to CO2 or before 80% of incubation, cooling (4 hours at 40\u00b0F), or freezing.95 In some cases inhaled anesthetics can be adminis - tered through the air cell at the large end of the egg. Egg addling can also be used.244 Embryos that have been exposed can be decapitated. Maceration, via use of a specially designed me - chanical apparatus having rotating blades or projec - tions, causes immediate fragmentation and death of newly hatched poultry and embryonated eggs.221 A review by the American Association of Avian Patholo - gists245 of the use of commercially available macera - tors for euthanasia of chicks, poults, and pipped eggs indicates that death by maceration in poultry up to 72 hours old occurs immediately with minimal pain and distress. Maceration is an alternative to the use of CO2 for euthanasia of poultry up to 72 hours old. Mac - eration is believed to be equivalent to cervical dislo - cation and cranial compression as to time element, and is considered to be an acceptable means of eu - thanasia for newly hatched poultry by the Federation of Animal Science Societies,246 Agriculture Canada,247 World Organization for Animal Health,136 and Euro - pean Council.248 Maceration requires special equipment that must be kept in excellent working order. Newly hatched poultry must be delivered to the macerator in a way and at a rate that prevents a backlog at the point of entry into the macerator and without causing injury, suffocation, or avoidable distress before maceration. S4 Equids Methods acceptable with conditions are equiva - lent to acceptable methods when all criteria for ap - plication of a method are met. S4.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS S4.1.1 humAn sAfety When equids are euthanized, consideration should be given to the unpredictability of a falling or thrashing equid. Most methods of euthanasia will re - sult in some degree of exaggerated muscular activity after the equid falls even if the equid is not experienc - ing pain or distress. Whatever euthanasia method is used should not put personnel at unnecessary risk.S4.1.2 dIspos Al of RemAIns For equids euthanized with pentobarbital, dispos - al of remains must be carried out promptly through on-farm burial, incineration or cremation, direct haul to a solid waste landfill, or biodigestion. This will help prevent exposure of wildlife and domestic animals to potentially toxic barbiturate residues. Disposal of re - mains must be conducted in accord with all federal, state, and local regulations. S4.2 METHODS S4.2.1 ACCeptABle methods S4.2.1.1 Noninhaled agents Barbiturates or barbituric acid derivatives \u2014 Pentobarbital or a pentobarbital combination is the principal choice for equine euthanasia by chemical means. Because a large volume of solution must be in - jected, use of an IV catheter placed in the jugular vein will facilitate the procedure. To facilitate catheteriza - tion of an excitable or fractious equid, such as acepromazine, or an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist can be administered, but these drugs may prolong time to loss of consciousness because of their effect on circulation and may result in varying de - grees of muscular activity and agonal gasping. Opioid agonists or agonist-antagonists in conjunction with 2-adrenergic may further facilitate restraint. S4.2.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S4.2.2.1 Physical methods PCB and gunshot \u2014Penetrating captive bolt and gunshot are considered acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of equids. Both should only be used by well-trained personnel who are regularly monitored to ensure proficiency, and firearms must be well maintained. Appropriate restraint is required for ap - plication of the PCB and special care should be taken to ensure that personnel are not injured by ricochet from free bullets. The correct anatomic site for application of gun - shot and PCB is illustrated in Figure 23 .249 The site for entry of the projectile is described as being on the intersection of 2 diagonal lines each running from the outer corner of the eye to the base of the oppo - site ear. S4.2.3 Adjun CtIve methods Recently, rendering plants and landfills have re - fused equine carcasses euthanized with pentobar - bital. For this reason, adjunctive methods should be considered. Anesthetizing the equid with xylazine- ketamine should be followed by one of the following: (1) saturated solution of potassium chloride injected IV or intracardially; (2) saturated solution of magne - sium sulfate injected IV; or (3) 60 mL of 2% lidocaine injected intrathecally.250 Each of these performed in an equid in a deep surgical plane of anesthesia is an acceptable method to invoke cardiac arrest and death. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 79Intrathecal administration of 2% lidocaine hydro - chloride to anesthetized horses resulted in sequential loss of respiration, loss of cerebrocortical activity, loss of brainstem function, and loss of cardiovascular activity, with loss of cerebrocortical activity occur - ring within 3.38 minutes after intrathecal lidocaine administration.214 Heart sounds persisted for up to 10 minutes, and ECG activity lasted up to 21 minutes, long after all brain activity had ceased. Tissues from horses euthanized via intrathecal lidocaine adminis - tration contained drug residues considered well be - low concentrations expected to pose hazards to scav almost immediate sedative action, but unless it is combined with other anesthetics, onset of anesthesia is delayed. Associated adverse effects can be severe and aestheti - cally objectionable, and chloral hydrate also has lim - ited availability. For these reasons, chloral hydrate is an unacceptable means of euthanizing equids. S4.3 SPECIAL CASES AND EXCEPTIONS In emergency situations, such as euthanasia of an equid with a serious injury at a racetrack or another equestrian event, it may be difficult to restrain a dan - gerous equid for IV injection. While administration of a sedative might be desirable, in some situations it is possible the equid could injure itself or bystanders before a sedative could take effect. In such cases, a neuromuscular blocking agent (eg, succinylcholine) may be administered to the equid IM or IV, but the equid must be euthanized via an appropriate method as soon as the equid can be controlled. Succinylcho - line alone or without sufficient anesthetic is not ac - ceptable for euthanasia. S5 Avians Methods acceptable with conditions are equiva - lent to acceptable methods when all criteria for ap - plication of a method are met. S5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS The following comments and recommendations pertain to pet, aviary, falconry, racing, research, and zoo birds. Information about appropriate euthanasia methods for wild birds can be found in the Reptiles, Zoo Animals, and Wildlife section of the Guidelines, whereas euthanasia of poultry and other birds used for food is addressed in the Animals Farmed for Food and Fiber section. Few peer-reviewed reports are available in the scientific literature about euthanasia of individual or small groups of birds. The information that does ex - ist comprises anecdotal accounts in book chapters, guidelines from various associations, and journal roundtable discussions and editorials.224,251-256,c There are scientific studies233,235,238,257-259 comparing various methods for depopulation of commercial poultry, but these methods may or may not meet the criteria for euthanasia, and may or may not be applicable to indi - vidual birds or small groups of birds. Because this taxon comprises more than 8,000 species, the choice of euthanasia method for a par - ticular bird will depend greatly on its species, size, anatomic and physiologic characteristics, environ - ment, degree of domestication, clinical state, and an - ticipated and actual response to restraint. Personnel performing euthanasia should be familiar with the species being euthanized, be able to interpret avian behavior indicative of stress, and use their knowledge and experience to choose restraint and euthanasia options that alleviate or minimize distress and result in rapid death. Legal requirements may apply in cases involving endangered or migratory species. S5.1.1 AnAtomy And phys Iology Birds differ anatomically and physiologically from mammals and these differences will affect whether and how particular euthanasia methods may be ac - ceptably applied. Because birds lack a diaphragm, they have a single coelomic cavity, rather than sepa - rate thoracic and abdominal cavities. When giving intracoelomic injections care must be taken that ma - terial is not injected into the air sacs, which could potentially drown the bird or expose its respiratory system to irritating substances. Air sacs act as a bel - lows to ventilate birds' small, nonexpanding lungs.260 Because there is no diaphragm, birds need to be able to move their sternum ventrally and cranially to breathe.261 Birds also have hollow, pneumatic bones, such as the humerus and femur, which communicate directly with the respiratory system. Pre-euthanasia and euthanasia drugs should not be administered via the intraosseous route into the humerus or femur be - cause drowning or irritation to the respiratory system may occur. Intraosseous catheters can, however, be safely placed in birds, preferably in the distal ulna or proximal tibiotarsus. A bird's respiratory system has greater capac - ity to process air than a mammal's due to a unique unidirectional flow of air through the lungs (which prevents mixing of inspired and expired air), more efficient gas exchange, and a greater surface area over which O2 can be exchanged (more and smaller air capillaries [3 \u00b5m] than the smallest mammalian al - veoli [35 \u00b5m]).261 Because of their greater capacity to process air, birds are more sensitive than mammals to inspired toxicants (eg, the proverbial canary in the coal mine collapsing before humans detect the meth - ane in the air).262 S5.1.2 RestRAInt Manual restraint for administering pre-eutha - nasia or euthanasia drugs is possible for many bird species. Nets or other equipment may be required or may improve conditions for both birds and people when handling birds less acclimated to human con -80 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONtact (eg, birds in zoos, wild birds). Multiple personnel may be required to safely handle larger species, such as ratites, and at least 1 additional person should be available to assist in case of an emergency. Chemical restraint may be useful in some situations, particu - larly for dangerous birds where human safety may be compromised by efforts at manual restraint. Drugs used for chemical restraint that are administered at high doses may serve as the first step of a 2-step eu - thanasia process. S5.2 METHODS Individual birds in a clinical or research setting can best be rendered unconscious by use of an in - haled agent (eg, isoflurane, sevoflurane, or halo - thane), prior to IV administration of an acceptable in - jectable euthanasia agent (eg, sodium pentobarbital). The following methods are considered to be accept - able or acceptable with conditions for avian species. For more detailed, non-species-specific information on various agents and methods, please refer to the Inhaled Agents, Noninhaled Pharmaceutical Agents, and Physical Methods sections of the Guidelines. S5.2.1 ACCeptABle methods S5.2.1.1 Noninhaled agents Intravenous injection of an injectable euthanasia agent is the quickest and most reliable means of euth - anizing birds when it can be performed without caus - ing fear or distress. Wild, fearful, or excited birds may require a sedative or anesthesia before IV injection can be performed. When IV injection is impossible, injectable euthanasia agents can be administered via intracoelomic, intracardiac, or intraosseous routes only if a bird is unconscious or anesthetized. If the intracoelomic route is used for birds, injection into the air sacs must be avoided, because of the potential for respiratory compromise, irritation of the respira - tory system, and delayed absorption via the air sacs. Euthanasia agents should also not be administered via the intraosseous route into the humerus or femur because of the potential for drowning or irritation to the respiratory system. Regardless of the route of ad - ministration, injectable agents can precipitate in tis - sues and can induce artifacts at necropsy and on his - topathologic examination.224,254,263 Barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives can be administered IV for euthanasia of anesthetized or properly restrained un - anesthetized birds. Barbiturates commonly used for injection are available as sodium salts that are alkaline and may be irritating and painful when injected di - rectly into tissues, rather than IV. Therefore, when IV injection is impossible, injectable euthanasia agents can be administered via intracoelomic, intracardiac, or intraosseous routes only if a bird is unconscious, or anesthetized. Concepts regarding barbiturate use in mammals generally also apply to birds and more information is available in the Noninhaled Agents section of the Guidelines.S5.2.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S5.2.2.1 Inhaled agents Inhaled anesthetics\u2014 Inhaled anesthetics may be used at high concentrations as a sole method of euthanasia or may be used to render birds uncon - scious prior to application of other methods of eu - thanasia.244,252 Exposure to high concentrations of inhaled anesthetics (eg, halothane, isoflurane, sevo - flurane, with or without N2O) is acceptable with con - ditions for euthanasia for birds. Birds exposed to high concentrations of inhaled anesthetic gases lose con - sciousness rapidly. Euthanasia via inhaled gases may be more practical than use of an injectable agent if large numbers of birds, such as in flock or aviary situ - ations, must be euthanized. Euthanasia by exposure to gas anesthetics also induces minimal tissue dam - age and results in the least amount of tissue artifact for necropsy.224,254 Carbon dioxide\u2014 High ( > 40%) concentrations of CO2 induce anesthesia initially followed by loss of consciousness. Euthanasia via exposure to CO2 has been described for individual birds and small groups,252 and its application to euthanasia of chick - ens, turkeys, and ducks has been studied extensively, resulting in information regarding times to collapse, unconsciousness, and death; loss of somatosensory evoked potentials; loss of visually evoked responses; and changes in EEG and ECG.257-259,264 Application rate of CO2 needs to be balanced with situational needs as rapid increases in CO2 concentration de - crease the amount of time to loss of posture and con - sciousness, while slower increases in concentration may cause less aversion or reaction, but increase time of exposure. Field applications of CO2 for broilers have resulted in stress levels similar to that invoked via routine handling265 or stress and distress similar to the handling or restraint required for other meth - ods of euthanasia.259 In a recent study, most turkeys would voluntarily enter a feeding chamber filled with Ar (90%), or a mixture of Ar (60%) and CO2 (30%), compared with only 50% of turkeys that would vol - untarily enter the chamber when filled with a high concentration of CO2 (72%) alone, suggesting an aver - sion to 72% CO2.266 More research is needed to better understand this comparative aversion in turkeys (eg, whether it is dose or species dependent and availabil - ity of agent). Concepts regarding the use of CO2 in mammals as described in the Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines generally also apply to birds. Exposure to CO2 may cause involuntary (unconscious) motor ac - tivity, such as flapping of the wings, which can dam - age tissues and be disconcerting to, and potentially dangerous for, observers.223,224 There are some special considerations for the use of CO2 for euthanasia of birds. Neonatal birds may be more acclimated to high CO2 concentrations, because the unhatched bird's environment typically has a high CO2 concentration (as high as 14% in the embryonic AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 81chicken). Consequently, CO2 concentrations required to achieve euthanasia of newly hatched chicks may be much higher (as much as 80% to 90%) than those for adults of the same species.244,259 Diving birds also have physiologic adaptations to hypercapnia and may require higher CO2 concentrations for euthanasia. Carbon monoxide \u2014Concepts regarding the use of CO for euthanasia of mammals also apply to birds. See the Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines for details. Nitrogen and argon \u2014Inert gases such as N2 and Ar, and gas mixtures involving these gases (including mixtures with CO2), have been used for euthanasia of poultry,267 but are not recommended for euthanasia of companion birds. Behavioral responses of broiler chickens were examined during short (10 seconds) exposures to 100% Ar, 100% N2, or mixtures (80% Ar:20% feeding and no aversive be - haviors were observed.268 Birds appear to not have in - trapulmonary chemoreceptors for N2 and Ar, and this may account for a lack of aversion during their initial exposure to and hypoxia from these gases.267 As a eu - thanasia agent, Ar gas mixed with < 2% O2 was shown to induce rapid loss of posture (average, 11 seconds), convulsions (average, 22 seconds), unconsciousness, and death (isoelectric EEG in 1 minute).269 Convul - sions can occur during euthanasia with these inert gases, but because these signs occurred after collapse and loss of consciousness, these gases are considered to be humane for the birds involved.267 S5.2.2.2 Physical methods Physical methods of euthanasia may be necessary in some field situations if other methods of euthana - sia are impractical or impossible to implement. That said, there is little scientific information available regarding the effect of various physical methods on electrical activity in the brain of birds, which makes evaluation of the humaneness of these procedures difficult. Cervical dislocation \u2014Cervical dislocation has generally been used for small birds ( < 200 g) when no other method is available, but the procedure has been performed on birds as large as 2.3 kg (5.1 lb). It should only be performed by well-trained personnel who are regularly monitored to ensure proficiency. Skilled individuals have been able to humanely per - form cervical dislocation in poultry. There is limited research specific to birds concerning electrical activ - ity in the brain following cervical dislocation. Cervi - cal dislocation of chickens (average weight of 2.3 kg) did not result in loss of visually evoked responses in 90% of cases when compared with use of a percus - sion bolt pistol, suggesting that fewer than 10% of cervical dislocations resulted in concussion.238 In 3- week-old turkeys (average weight of 1.6 kg [3.5 lb]) time to insensibility (based on nictitating membrane movement) was longer, but time to death (based on cessation of movement) was shorter after cervical dis - location compared with use of an NPCB and blunt force trauma.235 Whether pain is perceived is not known. Consciousness and perception of pain are not necessarily concurrent. Decapitation \u2014Based on information currently available, decapitation is considered to be accept - able with conditions for euthanasia of small ( < 200 g) birds. The AAZV Guidelines for Euthanasia of Non - domestic Animals244 also lists decapitation as accept - able with conditions, and suggests the method may be preferred over cervical dislocation under certain field conditions due to clear evidence of a successful procedure. One study270 indicated that several meth - ods of partial, mechanical decapitation of chickens (weighing 2.1 to 3.5 kg [4.6 to 7.7 lb]) did not result in the loss of visually evoked responses in 90% of cases when compared with use of a percussion bolt pistol and concluded that fewer than 10% of cervical dislo - cations resulted in concussion. In another study de - capitation applied to anesthetized chickens resulted in visually evoked responses up to 30 seconds follow - ing decapitation, but because the responses were ob - tained from anesthetized chickens it is not possible to conclude any association with cognitive process - es.95,270,271 As indicated previously (see discussion of Consciousness and Unconsciousness in the Guide - lines), at some level between behavioral unrespon - siveness and the induction of a flat EEG, conscious - ness must vanish; however, EEG data cannot provide definitive answers as to onset of unconsciousness. Gunshot \u2014Gunshot is not recommended as a method for captive birds, where restraint is feasible. Its use for wild birds is addressed in the Zoologic and Free-Ranging Nondomestic Animals section of the Guidelines. S5.2.3 CtIve methods Potassium chloride \u2014Although administration of potassium chloride to a conscious, unanesthetized bird is considered to be an unacceptable method of euthanasia, potassium chloride may be administered via the IV or intracardiac routes if a bird is uncon - scious or completely anesthetized prior to the injec - tion. Exsanguination \u2014Although exsanguination of a conscious, unanesthetized bird is an unacceptable approach to euthanasia, exsanguination may be used for euthanasia of unconscious or anesthetized birds. This approach may be appropriate if blood samples are needed for diagnostic or research purposes. Thoracic compression \u2014Although thoracic com - pression of a conscious, unanesthetized bird is an un - acceptable approach to euthanasia, it may be used as an adjunctive method for animals that are insentient. S5.2.4 UnACC eptABle Methods Thoracic compression (also known as cardiopul - monary or cardiac compression) is a method that has been used by biologists to terminate the lives of wild small mammals and birds, mainly under field condi - tions.272 Although this method has been used exten -82 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONsively in the field, data supporting its use, such as de - gree of distress induced and time to unconsciousness or death, are limited.273 Given current knowledge of the physiology of small mammals and birds, it can - not be assumed that thoracic compression does not result in pain or distress before animals become un - conscious. Consequently, thoracic compression is an unacceptable method of euthanizing animals that are not deeply anesthetized or insentient due to other reasons, but is appropriate as a secondary method for animals that are insentient. S5.3 EGGS, EMBRYOS, AND NEONATES Bird embryos that have attained > 80% incuba - tion demonstrate EEG activity that is sustained, with increases in amplitude suggesting the potential for pain perception in conscious embryos; therefore they should be euthanized by similar methods used in avian neonates such as anesthetic overdose, de - capitation, or prolonged ( > 20 minutes) exposure to CO2. Eggs at < 80% incubation may be destroyed by prolonged exposure ( > 20 minutes) to CO2,274 cool - ing (< 4\u00b0C for 4 hours), or freezing. Because research is still evolving and there are species-specific differ - ences in development, euthanasia of embryos should be performed based on the best available data and with attention to assuring, as best as possible, that conscious suffering does not occur. S6 Fish and Aquatic Invertebrates S6.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Fish and aquatic invertebrates play important roles as food, pets, research subjects, display animals, sources of recreation, and key components of healthy ecosystems. In each of these situations it may be nec - essary to cause the death of some animals. Consider - able evidence is accumulating that suggests it is ap - propriate to consider the possibility of pain percep - tion in these species.275-287 The aim is to accomplish death for these animals rapidly with the minimum amount of pain and distress practicable. Because the environment associated with fish and aquatic inverte - brates in each of their roles is different, and because knowledge about the evolutionary and societal status of poikilothermic animals (lower vertebrates and in - vertebrates) is limited, identifying and applying ap - propriate criteria for euthanasia can be difficult. S6.1.1 teRms ApplICAB le to endIng lIfe Specific to fish, the 3 main terms used to de - scribe the ending of life are euthanasia, slaughter, and humane killing. There is often confusion regard - ing how these terms and their associated methods differ. The methods described in the Guidelines serve as guidance for veterinarians and others who may need to perform euthanasia. These Guidelines are not intended to address slaughter, depopulation, or other killing methods. The AVMA Guidelines for the Humane Slaughter of Animals156 and the AVMA Guidelines for the Depopulation of Animals288 should be referenced in cases of slaughter or depopulation. The term harvest specifically refers to the act or pro - cess of gathering a crop, as in aquaculture and com - mercial fishing; however, harvest may also be used to describe fish removed from a water body by anglers. Whether harvested fish are slaughtered or humanely killed depends on the context of the activity.289-292 Addressing euthanasia of invertebrates in some set - tings is not meant to discount the necessity for and suitability of slaughter and pest control techniques that do not meet the definition of euthanasia. S6.1.2 humAn And AnImAl Cons IdeRAtIons Because of the diversity of physiologic and ana - tomic characteristics seen among species of fish and aquatic invertebrates, optimal methods for euthana - sia will vary. Euthanasia choices for fish and aquatic invertebrates must account for animal stress respons - es and human safety concerns associated with han - dling, as well as differences in metabolism, respira - tion, and tolerance to cerebral hypoxia. Virtually all methods require that personnel be carefully trained and monitored (although some carry more risks of human ineffectiveness than others), some require DEA registration and record keeping, and chemicals regulated by the EPA can only be legally used accord - ing to their label directions. Immersion of the fish or aquatic invertebrate in an appropriate euthanasia solution is often an easier method than using inject - able forms of euthanasia. Intracoelomic injections carry an inherent risk of organ damage and response time may vary. Intravenous injections require careful handling of fish, as well as trained and experienced personnel. Intramuscular injections with ketamine, 2-adrenergic receptor agonists, or Telazold can be ad - ministered via pole syringe or dart gun to larger fish to facilitate handling and reduce handling stress for fish, but rarely achieve surgical planes of anesthesia in teleosts. In all cases, veterinarians and others with expertise relevant to the species of interest should be consulted; professional judgment and relevant ex - pertise should be taken into account when ultimately determining the best method to use. In addition, it is often more difficult to ascertain when a fish or an aquatic invertebrate is dead as compared with birds and mammals. Some unique aspects of euthanasia for fish have been described.293,294 S6.1.3 pRepARA tIon And envIRonment As a general principle the preparations for eu - thanasia of fish should be very similar to the prepa - rations for anesthesia of fish.295-297 If possible, with - holding food for 12 to 24 hours prior to euthanasia will reduce regurgitation, defecation, and nitrog - enous waste production. The environment should be as quiet and nonstimulatory as possible given the circumstances. Light intensity should be reduced if AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 83possible, but with adequate lighting for personnel. This can also be achieved through use of a dark or opaque container and lid, or by use of less intense lighting (eg, red light illumination, as red light does not penetrate water well). Water quality should be similar to that of the envi - ronment from which the fish originated, or optimized for that species and situation, for the duration of eu - thanasia. If the water is of acceptable quality for fish health, the water in which they have been housed or captured should be used, and supplemental aeration and temperature control may be necessary. Either the immersion euthanasia solution is prepared with water from the fish housing system and the fish are trans - ferred into it or a concentrated form of the anesthetic agent as a solution (containing buffering agent if ap - propriate) is introduced directly into the container of fish to minimize stressors. If euthanizing a large popu - lation of fish, it is important to monitor the anesthetic bath water quality (temperature, dissolved O2, ammo - nia, and organic loading, in particular). The euthanasia agent may need to be supplemented or replaced pe - riodically because it will be removed when absorbed into the fish's bloodstream though the gills. Euthanasia methods should be tested in 1 animal or a small group of animals prior to use in a large population for an unfamiliar species, to ensure effectiveness.298 If han - dling the fish is required, appropriate equipment (nets, gloves) should be used to minimize stressors. S6.1.4 IndICAtoRs of deAth In fIsh And AquAtIC Inve RteBRA tes Because the thousands of species of fish and aquatic invertebrates vary greatly in anatomic and physiologic characteristics, reliable indicators of death may not be available for some. However, there are some standard approaches that can be useful for many of the more commonly encountered species. Loss of movement, loss of reactivity to any stimulus, and initial flaccidity (prior to rigor mortis) may serve as indicators of death for fish and some aquatic inver - tebrates. More useful indicators for many fish include respiratory arrest (cessation of rhythmic opercular activity) for a minimum of 30 minutes and loss of eye- roll (vestibulo-ocular reflex, the movement of the eye when the fish is rocked from side to side). The lat - ter is no longer present in fish that have been deeply anesthetized or euthanized.299 The heart can contin - ue to contract even after brain death or removal from the bodies of fish,300 so the presence of a heartbeat is not a reliable indicator of life, but sustained absence of heartbeat is a strong indicator of death. For more sessile, less active organisms, or those with specific anatomic or physiologic adaptations that prevent use of these indicators, it may be more difficult to assess loss of consciousness and death, and consulta - tion with species experts is recommended. Second - ary methods of euthanasia are recommended, when appropriate, after the fish or aquatic invertebrate is anesthetized, to ensure euthanasia.S6.1.5 dIspos ItIon of euth AnIzed AnImAls Any euthanized fish or invertebrate should be promptly removed from its aquarium, pond, or other vessel and disposed of according to all pertinent fed - eral, state, and local regulations, in a manner that will reduce the risk of disease spread, prevent pests and other nontarget species from gaining access to ani - mal remains, and ensure human and environmental safety. Preventing environmental contamination by any life stage of fish that could hatch and/or survive outside an acceptable, enclosed body of water is an important consideration in confirmation of death and disposal of the animal's remains. S6.1.6 fIsh And AquAtIC Inve RteBRA tes Intended foR humAn Consumpt Ion As previously indicated, the term slaughter is used primarily to refer to the killing of animals in - tended for human consumption (eg, agricultural har - vest, commercial fisheries) and these Guidelines are not intended to address that activity. However, when euthanasia of animals intended for human consump - tion is desired, tissue residues from the use of drugs and other chemicals will make many methods unac - ceptable unless they have been approved by the FDA for this purpose. Use of any unapproved chemicals for euthanasia prohibits entry of the fish into the food chain, either by rendering as fish meal or by dis - tributing as directly consumed product.290 With that said, currently there are no drugs approved by the FDA for euthanasia of fish or aquatic invertebrates. Carbon dioxide is a drug of low regulatory prior - ity301 that avoids unacceptable residues, but it is not an FDA-approved method for killing aquatic animals used for food. Physical methods that are acceptable with conditions include manually applied blunt force trauma to the head, decapitation, electrocution, and pithing. For more information regarding methods for slaughter, please refer to the AVMA Guidelines for the Humane Slaughter of Animals.156 S6.2 FINFISH Common methods used to euthanize fish include noninhaled methods (ie, immersion and injection) and physical methods. Because of general differences in anatomy and application seen between finfish and terrestrial animals (especially with regard to primary respiratory organs, and aqueous vs air environment), techniques involving addition of drugs to the fish's environment (ie, the water), for purposes of this doc - ument, are considered noninhaled methods. Descriptions of methods used to euthanize fish follow and include 1-step and 2-step procedures. Each method is further classified as acceptable, acceptable with conditions, or unacceptable considering char - acteristics of the methods and the environments in which euthanasia is conducted, including veterinary private practice (eg, companion and ornamental [dis - play] fish), ornamental (aquarium) fish wholesale and 84 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONretail facilities, research laboratories, and fish kept outdoors and in fisheries. An acceptable method reli - ably meets the requirements of euthanasia. Methods that are acceptable with conditions reliably meet the requirements of euthanasia when specified con - ditions are met. An unacceptable method does not meet the requirements of euthanasia. Because fishes' anatomic and physiologic characteristics are quite different from those of mammals and birds, classifi - cation of techniques may vary from what has been recommended for other species. S6.2.1 nonInhAled Agents Immersion (1 step) \u2014Intentional overdose via immersion in anesthetic solutions is a common method of euthanasia for fish.298,302-304 Some species exhibit aversive responses to particular anesthetic agents, while other species do not.305,306 Through preference and approach-avoidance testing, many anesthetic agents currently used for euthanasia have been identified as being aversive to varying degrees. Despite some evidence of distress and aversion, im - mersive anesthetics continue to be administered to fish because the benefits associated with their use outweigh any distress and aversion they may cause, similar to use of inhaled agents for air-breathing ani - mals. Fish should be left in the anesthetic solution for a minimum of 30 minutes after cessation of opercular movement.251,298,302 A recent study307 demonstrated that use of buffered MS 222 in a 1-step immersion technique was inadequate for euthanasia of goldfish (Carassius auratus ), a hypoxia-tolerant species. Re - sults from this study suggest that a 2-step method may be required for euthanasia of hypoxia-tolerant species,: step 1, immersion to render the fish un - conscious; step 2, a secondary adjunctive method to complete euthanasia (such as decapitation, pithing, or freezing). Options for immersion agents include the following: (1) Benzocaine or benzocaine hydrochloride, buff - ered. Solutions for immersion should be pre - pared in concentrations 250 mg/L and should be buffered.304 (2) Carbon dioxide. Immersion in CO2-saturated wa - ter causes narcosis and loss of consciousness after several minutes.251,298 Some species may exhibit hyperactivity prior to loss of consciousness.302 Purity and concentration of CO2 are important for effectiveness. Only CO2 from a source that allows for careful regulation of concentration, such as from cylinders, is acceptable. Care must be taken when using CO2 to prevent exposure to personnel (ie, euthanasia must be conducted in well-ventilated areas). (3) Ethanol. Ethanol has been suggested as an accept - able alternative method for fish euthanasia.308 The depressive effects of ethanol on the CNS are well described,309 and exposure of zebrafish via immersion has become a model for behavioral and molecular responses to alcohol, at concen -trations from 10 to 30 mL of 95% ethanol/L.310-312 At this dose, alcohol induces anesthesia, and pro - longed immersion produces death via respiratory depression causing anoxia. This is not equivalent to immersing fish directly into preservative con - centrations of ethanol (70%), which is not ac - ceptable as a euthanasia method. (4) Eugenol, isoeugenol, and clove oil. Whenever possible, products with standardized, known concentrations of essential oils should be used so that accurate dosing is possible. Concentrations required for anesthesia will vary depending on species and other factors, but may be as low as 17 mg/L for some species. Greater concentrations (10 times the upper range for anesthesia) will be required for euthanasia.298,313-315 These oils are not very water soluble; injecting the solution through a syringe and fine-gauge needle under the water in the container used for euthanizing is helpful in ensuring dispersal in the water. Fish should be left in the anesthetic solution for a min - imum of 10 minutes after cessation of opercular movement. These compounds are equivocal or known carcinogens according to the National Toxicology Program.316 Some studies in rodents indicate this group of anesthetics may cause pa - ralysis in addition to having anesthetic effects, and analgesic properties are unknown.70,317-319 The FDA strictly prohibits the use of clove oil and eugenol as anesthetics in fish having the potential to enter the food chain, except under Investigational New Animal Drug exemptions.320 Isoeugenol is a potential carcinogen316 so human safety in the application of that agent is of con - cern. (5) Isoflurane, sevoflurane. These concentrated liq - uid anesthetics can be added to water, although they are generally not very water soluble.302 In- jecting the solution through a syringe and fine gauge needle under the water in the container used for euthanizing is helpful in ensuring dis - persal in the water. Doses of > 5 to 20 mL/L can be used (10 times the upper range for anesthe - sia). However, because both anesthetics are high - ly volatile, human safety is of concern and use in a well-ventilated area is imperative. (6) Quinaldine sulfate. Solutions for immersion should be prepared in concentrations 100 mg/L.321 Quinaldine sulfate will acidify water; therefore, buffering is required to prevent dis - tress from acute drop in pH. (7) Tricaine methanesulfonate, buffered (MS 222, TMS). An aversive response to MS 222 has been demonstrated for zebrafish and medaka, while carp, fathead minnow, and rainbow trout showed no aversion.305,306 Despite evidence of distress and aversion, immersive anesthetics continue to be administered to fish because the benefits as - sociated with their use outweigh any distress and aversion they may cause. Solutions must be buff - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 85ered, and concentrations required for euthanasia may vary depending upon the species, life stage, and water chemistry parameters. A concentra - tion of 250 to 500 mg/L, or 5 to 10 times the anes - thetic dosage, is effective for most species.298,304 MS 222 at a dose of 400 mg/L has been shown to be ineffective for a few species (eg, Gulf of Mex - ico sturgeon).298 A recent study307 demonstrated that use of buffered MS 222 in a 1-step immer - sion technique was inadequate for euthanasia of goldfish ( C auratus ), a hypoxia-tolerant species. Results from this study support the recommen - dation for use of a 2-step method for euthana - sia of goldfish and some other hypoxia-tolerant species, including cichlids, with the first step of involving immersion to render the fish uncon - scious and the second involving application of an adjunctive method (such as decapitation, pithing, or freezing) to complete euthanasia. Fish that are too large for practical or cost-effective immersion in lethal doses of buffered MS 222 can be eutha - nized by applying the concentrated, buffered so - lution directly to the gills.298,302 (8) 2-phenoxyethanol. Solutions for immersion should be prepared in concentrations 0.5 to 0.6 mL/L or 0.3 to 0.4 mg/L.321 (9) Lidocaine. A buffered solution at 400 mg/L is ef - fective for euthanasia of adult zebrafish,109 but response to lidocaine by immersion varies con - siderably across species. Injection \u2014Injectable agents have been admin - istered for euthanasia via IV, intracoelomic, IM, and intracardiac routes.298,308 (1) Pentobarbital (1 step). (60 to 100 mg/kg [27.3 to 45.5 mg/lb]) can be administered by IV, intracardiac, or intracoelo - mic routes for euthanasia.251 Pentobarbital may also be administered via intracardiac injection for anesthetized animals as the second step of a 2-step euthanasia procedure. Death usually oc - curs within 30 minutes. (2) Ketamine (2 step). Ketamine may be adminis - tered at dosages from 66 to 88 mg/kg315 (30 to 40 mg/lb) via an IM injection followed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital. Observers should be ad - vised about the possibility of ketamine-induced muscle spasms during induction.298 (3) Ketamine-medetomidine (2 step). A combination of ketamine, at dosages of 1 to 2 mg/kg, with medetomidine, at dosages of 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/lb), may be administered via IM injection followed by a lethal dose of pentobar - bital.315(4) Propofol (2 step). A dose of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg (0.7 to 1.1 mg/lb) can be administered IV followed by an injection of a lethal dose of pento - barbital.315 S6.2.2 phys ICAl methods The following methods can be applied for eutha - nasia, providing they are performed with the proper equipment by trained personnel who are regularly monitored for proficiency. (1) Decapitation followed by pithing (2 step). Rapid severance of the head and brain from the spinal cord, followed by pithing of the brain, will cause rapid death and unconsciousness. Decapitation alone is not considered a humane approach to euthanasia, especially for species that may be particularly tolerant of low O2 concentrations. Pithing helps ensure rapid loss of brain function and death for those species.322 (2) Cervical transection using a knife or other sharp instrument inserted caudal to the skull to sever the spinal cord and cervical vertebrae, followed by pithing (2 step). The rationale for this ap - proach is similar to that for decapitation (destruc - tion of connections between brain and spinal cord) and pithing (destruction of brain tissue), except that the head is still physically attached by musculature to the body. (3) Manually applied blunt force trauma (cranial concussion; Figure 24 ) followed by pithing or exsanguination (2 step). Manually applied blunt force trauma (a rapid, accurately placed blow of sufficient energy to the cranium with an appro - priate-sized club) can cause immediate uncon - sciousness and potentially death, but should be followed by pithing or exsanguination to ensure death. The fish's size, species, and anatomy and characteristics of the blow (including its accu - racy, speed, and club mass) will determine the efficacy of manually applied blunt force trauma. This procedure requires training and monitoring for proficiency. Anatomic features, such as the location of the eyes, can help serve as a guide to the location of the brain.322,323 (4) Penetrating captive bolt or NPCB (Figure 25) . These methods are usually applied to large fish species.322 (5) Maceration (1 step). When applied correctly, us - ing a well-maintained macerator specifically de - signed for the size of fish being euthanized, death is nearly instantaneous.324 The process is aestheti - cally unpleasant for some operators and observ - ers. (6) Rapid chilling (hypothermic shock; 1 step or 2 step). It is acceptable for zebrafish ( D rerio ) to be euthanized by rapid chilling (2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C) until loss of orientation and operculum movements108,110,111 and subsequent holding times in ice-chilled wa - ter, specific to fish size and age. Zebrafish adults (approx 3.8 cm long) can be rapidly killed (10 to 20 seconds) by immersion in 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 39\u00b0F) water. Adult zebrafish should be exposed for a minimum of 10 minutes and fry 4 to 7 dpf for at least 20 minutes following loss of oper - culum movement to ensure death. Use of rapid chilling and use of buffered MS 222 alone have been shown to be unreliable euthanasia methods for zebrafish embryos < 3 dpf. To ensure embry -86 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONonic lethality these methods should be followed with an adjunctive method such as use of dilute sodium or calcium hypochlorite solution at 500 mg/L.111,115 If necessary to ensure death of other life stages, rapid chilling may be followed by ei - ther an approved adjunctive euthanasia method or a humane killing method. Until further re - search is conducted, rapid chilling is acceptable with conditions for other small-bodied, similarly sized tropical and subtropical stenothermic spe - cies. Species-specific thermal tolerance and body size will determine the appropriateness and ef - fectiveness of rapid chilling for euthanasia of fish. Fish size is important because the rate of heat loss via thermal conduction from a body is proportional to its surface area. Based on these 2 factors, it has been suggested that rapid chilling in water associated with an ice slurry is a suitable killing method for small tropical and subtropical fish species 3.8 cm in length (tip of the snout to the posterior end of the last vertebra) or smaller, having lower lethal temperatures above 4\u00b0C. To ensure optimal hypothermal shock (ie, rapid killing), transfer of fish into ice water must be com - pleted as quickly as possible. This means rapid transi - tions from acclimatization temperature to 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C must be achieved. This can be accomplished by using minimal water volume to transfer fish (ie, using a net to place fish in chilled water). In addition, fish should not be in direct contact with the ice in the water; rather a depression should be formed in the ice slurry to expose the entire surface of the fish to the chilled water. Full contact with cold water ensures optimal exposure and rapid chilling of the fish. Water tem - perature must not exceed 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C. Well-insulated containers, such as coolers, will assist in maintaining the ice slurry and a probe thermometer can be used to confirm water temperature. This method of euthanasia is not appropriate for temperate, cool, or cold-water-tolerant fish, such as carp, koi, goldfish, or other species that can survive at 4\u00b0C and below. It is appropriate for zebrafish and other small-bodied (3.8-cm-long or smaller) tropi - cal and subtropical stenothermic fish, for which the lower lethal temperature range is above 4\u00b0C.108,110,111 This method can also be acceptable for small to me - dium-sized (2.8- to 13.5-cm-long) Australian river giz - zard shad, as long as secondary euthanasia methods are applied after fish are rendered nonresponsive.110 However, because of surface-to-volume consider - ations, use of this method is not appropriate in other medium- to large-bodied fish until data regarding its applicability to euthanasia for those species become available. S6.2.3 Adjun CtIve methods Decapitation, pithing, exsanguination, freezing, and other physical or chemical methods for destroy - ing brain function may be used as the second step of a 2-step procedure when fish have been rendered unconscious prior to their application by an accept - able or acceptable-with-conditions, first-step method. If necessary to ensure death, rapid chilling for speci - fied groups may be followed by an approved adjunc - tive euthanasia method. Use of a dilute sodium hypo - chlorite or calcium hypochlorite solution may be an adjunctive method for early life stages of fish, includ - ing embryos and larvae.108,115 S6.2.4 UnACCept ABle Methods The following are unacceptable methods of eu - thanasia in any situation. Flushing of fish into sewer, septic, or other types of outflow systems is unaccept - able for many reasons. Water chemistry and quality may delay time to death and result in exposure to noxious compounds. For systems in close proximity to and/or connected to natural waterways, pathogen release or transmission may occur from diseased or carrier animals. Slow chilling or freezing of unanes - thetized animals, including placing fish into a freez - er without prior anesthesia, is also an unacceptable method. Similarly death by anoxia and desiccation after removal from the water or by anoxia in water; any death due to exposure to caustic chemicals; and death including prolonged traumatic injury prior to unconsciousness are unacceptable. While metomidate has been used for euthanasia of some finfish species, its listing in the Index of Le - gally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species by the FDA (with a specified use for sedation and anesthesia) means that its extralabel use for euthanasia is currently illegal. S6.2.5 lIfe stAge Cons IdeRAtIons The effectiveness of euthanasia methods de - scribed in these guidelines may vary by life stage, as well as by species. Early stages in the lives of fish, including embryos and larvae, may require higher concentrations of immersion anesthetics or a longer duration of exposure.303 As an example, immersion in a buffered MS 222 solution having a concentration > 1 g/L is not a reliable method for killing some fish in younger life stages.108,111,303 For some species and in some situations, adjunctive methods to guarantee death may need to be applied for these animals after anesthesia with buffered MS 222. Rapid chilling fol - lowed by an adjunctive method such as immersion in a dilute sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlo - rite solution is acceptable for zebrafish embryos and larvae as a 2-step method and is also acceptable with conditions as a 2-step method for destruction of other (nonzebrafish) species' embryos and larvae.111,115 S6.2.6 fInfIsh In pARtICulAR envIRonments S6.2.6.1 Veterinary private practice\u2014companion and ornamental (display) fish Clients with pet or display fish of any species often value them as companion animals and share a AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 87human-animal bond similar to that seen between cli - ents and other pets, such as dogs and cats. Therefore, it is important to consider the perception of the client when euthanasia methods are chosen. Clients should be offered the opportunity to be present during eu - thanasia whenever feasible; however, clients also should be educated as to what method will be used and what they may observe during euthanasia. For example, clients may believe the excitement phase of anesthesia, which can result in increased motor activ - ity or the appearance of agitation,302 is unduly painful or stressful for the fish even when it is not. The following methods are acceptable for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in solutions of buffered MS 222, buff ered benzocaine, isoflurane and sulfate, pentobarbital, ketamine followed by pentobarbital, a combination of ketamine and medetomidine followed by pentobarbital, and propofol followed by pentobarbital. Owners should be advised about the possibility of ket - amine-induced muscle spasms during induction when using that agent. The following methods are acceptable with con - ditions for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in eugenol, isoeugenol, or clove oil. Fish should be left in the solution for a minimum of 10 minutes after cessation of opercular move - ment.298,302 The following methods are not recommended for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in CO2-saturated water is not recom - mended because some fish exposed to this meth - od may become hyperactive, which can be dis - concerting for staff and owners. (2) Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head, decapitation, and pithing are not recommended because their application can be distressing for owners and staff. Early stages in the lives of fish, including embry - os and larvae, may require higher concentrations of immersion anesthetics or a longer duration of expo - sure.303 As an example, immersion in a buffered MS 222 solution having a concentration > 1 g/L is not a reliable method for killing some fish in early life stag - es.108,111,303 For some species and in some situations, adjunctive methods to guarantee death may need to be applied for these animals after anesthesia with buffered MS 222. Rapid chilling followed by immersion in a dilute sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite solu - tion is acceptable for zebrafish embryos and larvae as a 2-step method and is also acceptable with condi - tions as a 2-step method for destruction of other (non - zebrafish) species' embryos and larvae.111,115 S6.2.6.2 Aquarium fish wholesale and retail facilities Freshwater and marine aquarium fish are com - mercially collected from the wild, and are also bred in captivity. Tropical aquarium fish are sold at retail pet shops and fish stores from systems housing 1 or more species of fish per tank. Individual fish or popu - lations of fish may become injured or diseased and require euthanasia. Methods of euthanasia used in this environment need to be applicable to individual fish, to all fish in an aquarium, to fish held in multiple aquariums on a central filtration system, or for fish ponds. In certain situations euthanasia may not be feasible and depopulation methods may be required. The following methods are acceptable for use in this environment: Immersion in solutions of buffered MS 222, buff - ered benzocaine, ethanol, and quinaldine sulfate. Fish should be left in the anesthetic solution for 30 min - utes after cessation of opercular movement.251,298,302 The following methods are acceptable with con - ditions for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in CO2-saturated water (as long as ob - servers are advised and can accept that some fish exposed to this method may exhibit hyperactiv - ity and appear to be in distress); immersion in a euge nol, isoeugenol, or clove oil solution; or im - mersion in an ethanol solution. (2) Decapitation, cervical transection, or manually applied blunt force trauma as step 1 of a 2-step method, followed by pithing. (3) Freezing may be used as an adjunctive method of euthanasia following anesthesia. (4) Rapid chilling (hypothermic shock) for small- bodied (3.8-cm-long or smaller) tropical and sub - tropical stenothermic fish, for which the lower lethal temperature range is above 4\u00b0C.108,110,111 The following methods are not recommended for use in this environment: Use of injectable anesthetic drugs including bar - biturates, especially for larger species, requires the oversight of a veterinarian and DEA permitting for controlled substances. Therefore, unless a veterinar - ian is available on-site to oversee use of these drugs, this method is not recommended in this environ - ment. Early stages in the lives of fish, including embry - os and larvae, may require higher concentrations of immersion anesthetics or a longer duration of expo - sure.303 As an example, immersion in a buffered MS 222 solution having a concentration > 1 g/L is not a reliable method for killing some fish in early life stag - es.108,111,303 For some species and in some situations, adjunctive methods to guarantee death may need to be applied for these animals after anesthesia with buffered MS 222. Rapid chilling followed by immersion in a dilute sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite solu - tion is acceptable for zebrafish embryos and larvae as a 2-step method and is also acceptable with condi - tions as a 2-step method for destruction of other (non - zebrafish) species' embryos and larvae.111,115 S6.2.6.3 Research facilities Researchers working in laboratories should have 88 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONmaterials readily available to provide appropriate eu - thanasia for their research subjects when required, and should be trained and monitored for proficiency in the use of chosen techniques. Many facilities using fish as research subjects are engaged in biomedical research. Zebrafish are the most common species used for re - search and are usually kept in small-scale tank systems; however, some research facilities may also have large- scale housing and production systems or keep other larger species of fish and, consequently, may need to consider additional options for euthanasia.272 The ex - pertise of those knowledgeable about these settings and species should be sought as necessary. The following methods are acceptable for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in solutions of buffered MS 222, buff ered benzocaine, lidocaine, quinaldine sulfate, and 2-phenoxyethanol. Fish euthanized with these methods are not approved for use as hu - man food. (2) Rapid chilling (hypothermic shock) is acceptable for zebrafish ( D ( N erebi ) as long as transfer from ac - climatized temperatures to water associated with a 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C ice slurry occurs rapidly with as little transfer of warmer water as possible. The following methods are acceptable with con - ditions for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in CO2-saturated water (as long as ob - servers are advised and can accept that some fish exposed to this method may exhibit hyperactiv - ity and appear to be in distress) or immersion in a eugenol, isoeugenol, or clove oil solution. (2) Rapid chilling (hypothermic shock) to 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C is acceptable with conditions for small-bodied (3.8-cm-long or smaller) tropical and subtropical stenothermic fish, for which the lower lethal tem - perature range is above 4\u00b0C. Because of surface- to-volume considerations, use of this method is not appropriate for other medium- to large-bod - ied fish until additional data for those species be - come available. (3) Maceration is acceptable with conditions when death is instantaneous from using a well-main - tained macerator designed for the size of fish be - ing euthanized. The process is likely to be aes - thetically unpleasant for those observing it. (4) Decapitation followed by pithing. Rapid sever - ance of the head and brain from the spinal cord, followed by pithing of the brain, will cause rapid death and unconsciousness.272 (5) Manually applied blunt force trauma (cranial con - cussion) followed by pithing or exsanguination. Early stages in the lives of fish, including embry - os and larvae, may require higher concentrations of immersion anesthetics or a longer duration of expo - sure.303 As an example, immersion in a buffered MS 222 solution having a concentration > 1 g/L is not a reliable method for killing some fish in earlier life stages.108,111,303 For some species and in some situa -tions, adjunctive methods to guarantee death may need to be applied for these animals after anesthesia with buffered MS 222. Rapid chilling followed by immersion in a dilute sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite solu - tion is acceptable for zebrafish embryos and larvae as a 2-step method and is also acceptable with con - ditions as a 2-step method for destruction of other (nonzebrafish) species' embryos and larvae. S6.2.6.4 Fish kept outdoors and in fisheries Field research on fish takes place in a complex environment that must be understood by both re - searchers and their respective IACUC.272 Field re - search is frequently conducted on a scale comparable to commercial fishing, often with the same equip - ment, boats, and personnel. The large number of fish, limited boat space, adverse environmental condi - tions, and personnel safety concerns may justify use of harvest techniques that may not meet the criteria for euthanasia, but in all situations, pain and distress should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. Similarly, fisheries biologists may be faced with situa - tions involving numerous fish requiring depopulation (eg, invasive species) rather than euthanasia. Fieldwork on fish may also be conducted on a smaller scale under conditions that make euthanasia feasible. In such cases, the following methods should be applied and convenience for the researcher should not be a primary consideration. The following methods are acceptable for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in solutions of buffered MS 222, buff ered benzocaine, quinaldine sulfate, isoflurane or sevoflurane, ethanol, quinaldine sulfate, and 2-phenoxyethanol. Although a general concern for all environments and situations, the potential effects of drug residues and proper disposal of animal remains should be considered when us - ing any of these drugs. (2) An injection of pentobarbital (60 to 100 mg/kg) can be administered IV or intracoelomically.321 Pentobarbital may also be administered intracar - dially in anesthetized animals. Two-step injection procedures may also be used, including ketamine (IM) followed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital; a combination of ketamine and medetomidine (IM) followed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital; and propofol (IV) followed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital. Although a general concern for all environments and situations, the potential effects of drug residues and proper disposal of animal remains should be considered when us - ing any of these drugs. The following methods are acceptable with con - ditions for use in this environment: (1) Immersion in CO2-saturated water (as long as ob - servers are advised and can accept that some fish exposed to this method may exhibit hyperactiv - ity and appear to be in distress) or immersion in a euge nol, isoeugenol, or clove oil solution. AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 89(2) Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head followed by pithing or exsanguination. (3) Decapitation followed by pithing. Decapitation alone is not considered a humane form of eutha - nasia, especially for species that may be particu - larly tolerant of low O2 concentrations. Pithing helps ensure rapid death for those species. (4) Cervical transection followed by pithing or ex - sanguination. The rationale for this approach is similar to that for decapitation and pithing, ex - cept that the head is still physically attached by musculature to the body. (5) Captive bolt. This method is usually applied to large fish species. (6) Rapid chilling (hypothermic shock) in water of 2\u00b0 to 4\u00b0C for small-bodied (3.8-cm-long or small - er) tropical and subtropical stenothermic species (as previously described for zebrafish). Because of surface-to-volume considerations, use of this method is not appropriate in medium- to large- bodied fish until pertinent data for those species become available. Early stages in the lives of fish, including embry - os and larvae, may require higher concentrations of immersion anesthetics or a longer duration of expo - sure.303 As an example, immersion in a buffered MS 222 solution having a concentration > 1 g/L is not a reliable method for killing some fish in early life stag - es.108,111,303 For some species and in some situations, adjunctive methods to guarantee death may need to be applied for these animals after anesthesia with buffered MS 222. Rapid chilling followed by immer - sion in a dilute sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypo - chlorite solution is acceptable for zebrafish embryos and larvae as a 2-step method and is also acceptable with conditions as a 2-step method for destruction of other (nonzebrafish) species' embryos and lar - vae.111,115 S6.3 AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES Overdose of a general anesthetic is as appropri - ate a euthanasia strategy for aquatic invertebrates as it is for fish. And, immersion is an effective route of ad - ministration of anesthetic and euthanasia agents.325,326 Because confirming the death of many inverte - brates is difficult, 2-step euthanasia procedures are often recommended in which chemical induction of anesthesia, nonresponsiveness, or presumptive death is followed by an adjunctive method that destroys the brain or major ganglia physically (eg, pithing, freez - ing, boiling) or chemically (eg, alcohol, formalin). Ap - plication of the latter methods by themselves is gen - erally not considered to meet the criteria established for euthanasia.325,326 S6.3.1 ACCeptABle fIRst steps of eutha -nasia agent for aquatic invertebrates, although they are ineffective for crustaceans. Research indicates the magnesium ion acts centrally and also blocks both afferent and efferent nerve transmission in sup - pressing neural activity of cephalopods.327,328 A range of concentrations has been recommended for various phyla. A stock solution of MgCl2.6H2O at a concen - tration of 7.5% (75 g/L, about 370mM in deionized water) is nearly isosmotic with seawater and can be added to water in increasing ratios up to 1:1 stock solution volume to water volume (3.75%, 37.5 g/L, about 185 mM) or higher to effect euthanasia.329,330 A direct addition of magnesium salts to seawater results in a hyperosmotic solution.331 Magnesium salts may be combined with ethanol for euthanasia of cephalo - pods.331 Immersion for at least 15 minutes is recom - mended for cephalopods, as is an adjunct method like decerebration at least 5 minutes after respiratory ar - rest or after the animal is insensible.328,330 At least 30 minutes' immersion is recommended if brain destruc - tion is not an option.330 Species susceptibility to the effects of magnesium salts varies.329,330 Clove oil or eugenol \u2014Clove oil has been used effectively as an immersion agent for the euthanasia of some crustaceans (0.125 mL/L).325,332 Isoeugenol is a potential carcinogen316 so human safety in the application of that agent is of concern. Ethanol \u2014Ethanol has been used for euthanasia of some phyla, acting by inhibiting neuronal sodium and calcium channels in molluscs.309 It inhibits both afferent and efferent nerve transmission in cephalo - pods.328 Initial aversion and excitement have been reported as occurring in some but not all cephalo - pods.327,333,334 It is used at a concentration of 1% to 5% (10 to 50 mL/L)328,335 up to 10%,329 in contrast with concentrations of > 70% used for preservation, and may be less effective at cooler temperatures.334 It is recommended that ethanol be added slowly with mixing.329 Ethanol may be combined with a magne - sium salt solution for euthanasia of cephalopods.331 Immersion of at least 10 minutes followed by an adjunctive method such as decerebration is recom - mended.330 Species susceptibility to the effects of ethanol varies.330 Other agents for euthanasia, while less common, have been described and may be useful for specific applications.325,329 S6.3.2 ACCeptABle seCond steps of 2-step methods S6.3.2.1 Noninhaled agents for immersion Noninhaled agents that can be administered via immersion as the second step of a 2-step euthanasia approach include 70% alcohol and neutral-buffered 10% formalin. These agents are not acceptable, how - ever, for immersion as a single-step procedure, nor as the first step of a 2-step procedure. S6.3.2.2 Physical methods Pithing, freezing, and boiling are acceptable as the second step (adjunctive methods) of a 2-step eu -90 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONthanasia procedure. Pithing requires detailed ana - tomic knowledge of the species in question. These methods are not acceptable, however, as a single-step procedure, nor as the first step of a 2-step procedure. S6.3.3 lIfe stAge Cons IdeRAtIons The effectiveness of euthanasia methods de - scribed in the Guidelines may vary depending on life stage and species. As for fish, this should be consid - ered when euthanizing aquatic invertebrates. Meth - ods used for different life stages of the same species may require modification to maximize their effective - ness. Recommendations regarding use of adjunctive methods (as described previously) may also be neces - sary to guarantee death. S6.3.4 unACC eptABle methods Methods of killing that do not cause rapid death or that cause trauma prior to loss of consciousness are not considered humane methods of death, or eu - thanasia. These can include removing a fish or aquatic in - vertebrate from the water and allowing it to die by hy - poxia secondary to desiccation of gill tissue; leaving fish or aquatic invertebrates in a container of water without adequate aeration, causing death by anoxia; or any death due to exposure to caustic chemicals or traumatic injury without first inducing unconscious - ness in the fish or aquatic invertebrate. S7 Zoologic and Free- Ranging Nondomestic Animals Methods acceptable with conditions are equiva - lent to acceptable methods when all criteria for ap - plication of a method are met. S7.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS The nondomestic captive and free-ranging ani - mals discussed in the following sections vary sub - stantially in their anatomic and physiologic charac - teristics, native environment, behavior, social struc - ture, responses to humans, and other traits. These variations challenge the application and effectiveness of euthanasia methods for the many different species. The efficacy of these methods can be further limited by the circumstances under which euthanasia is per - formed. Consequently, the best means of terminat - ing an animal's life might not strictly conform to the definition of euthanasia. For nondomestic captive or free-ranging animals, the methods selected will often be situation specific, as a means of minimizing poten - tial risks to the animal's welfare and personnel safety. In addition, challenges associated with disposal of the remains of animals with drug residues that have been addressed in the section of the document on Disposal of Remains (eg, secondary toxicosis, envi - ronmental contamination, and other topics) are rel - evant to disposal of the remains of nondomestic ani - mals, particularly under field conditions. Given the complexity of issues that euthanasia of nondomestic animals presents, personnel are encouraged to con - sult references on anatomy, physiology, natural his - tory, husbandry, and other disciplines that will aid in understanding how various methods may impact an animal's euthanasia experience.95,271,336-338 Consulta - tion with experienced colleagues is recommended, particularly when novel circumstances and/or spe - cies are encountered. Animals may become distressed due to physical discomfort, anxiety in atypical social settings and physical surroundings, pheromones or odors from nearby or previously euthanized animals, and the presence of humans. In addition, human safety, ob - servers' perceptions, availability of trained personnel, potential infectious disease concerns, conservation and other population objectives, regulatory oversight that may be species specific, available equipment and facilities, options for disposal, potential secondary toxicity, research objectives, and other factors must be considered. Human safety is of utmost importance for all euthanasia procedures, and appropriate proto - cols and equipment (including supplies for address - ing human injury due to animal handling or exposure to immobilizing drugs) must be available prior to han - dling animals.339 Laws and regulations pertaining to the species being euthanized, the euthanasia meth - ods employed, and disposal of the remains must be followed. Euthanasia of captive wild animals requires con - sideration of basic stewardship, physiologic and be - havioral variation, and relief from pain and anxiety. Management can be guided by the physical and social setting the animal is in (eg, small enclosures, seminat - ural conditions), the animal's temperament, seasonal factors (eg, reproductive stage, physical condition, age and size), and differences from similar domestic species. Appropriate handling and modifying the ani - mal's physical and social environment to minimize distress, as well as administration of anxiolytics, are recommended. Provision of preferred bedding, tem - perature, humidity, and security in the period lead - ing up to euthanasia will allow the animal to be as comfortable as possible. Most small animals will find security in a dimly lighted, appropriately bedded and ventilated crate, box, tube, or similar container as this simulates a natural tendency to hide from per - ceived threats. Some species respond well to being left within typical social groups or familiar surround - ings as long as possible prior to euthanasia to mini - mize anxiety. Best practice for many captive wild animal spe - cies includes a multistep approach, beginning with administration of a sedative or anesthetic to relieve anxiety and pain. For wild animals in captivity, physi - cal and/or chemical restraint is usually required be - fore euthanasia can be performed. Physical restraint is appropriate when skilled staff, facilities, suitable equipment, and the animal's characteristics allow rapid immobilization with minimal distress.339 Refer - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 91ences should be consulted for appropriate doses of anesthetics and anxiolytics and preferred routes of administration.8,340-342 Animals can be premedicated via IM injection and/or orally. Intravenous adminis - tration of drugs is generally difficult without physical or chemical restraint. Chamber delivery of inhaled agents having little odor, such as sevoflurane, allows for induction of anesthesia in smaller species with minimal stress. Injectable anesthesia can be momen - tarily painful or discomforting during or immediately after administration due to a combination of volume, formulation, and route of administration, as well as the distress associated with physical restraint. The ad - vantages and disadvantages of administering anxio - lytics, anesthetics, or other drugs and applying physi - cal restraint should be balanced against the benefit of providing a swift death to end suffering. Research is needed to improve the euthanasia options available for some taxonomic groups and circumstances. S7.2 CAPTIVE INVERTEBRATES Invertebrates comprise more than 95% of the animal kingdom's species and include unrelated spiders (Araneae),343 centipedes millipedes (Myriapoda), insects many others. Terrestrial invertebrates play im - portant roles in laboratory research, as display ani - mals, and as companions in the home. Despite their varied roles, limited guidance is available on appro - priate methods by which invertebrates may be eu - thanized.251,336,345-347 This is due, in part, to a lack of coverage under animal welfare regulations applicable to animals used for research and other purposes in the United States and other countries.333,348 Diversity in anatomic, physiologic, and other characteristics limits generalizations across taxa.349 Of particular rel - evance are differences in innervation and circulatory systems, some of which do not have close corollar - ies in familiar vertebrate systems. This creates chal - lenges for developing humane means of terminating invertebrates' lives. While there is ongoing debate about inverte - brates' abilities to perceive pain or otherwise expe - rience compromised welfare, the Guidelines assume that a conservative and humane approach to the care of any creature is warranted and expected by society. Consequently, euthanasia methods should be used that minimize the potential for pain or distress. Most commonly used methods involve terminal anesthesia, followed by physical destruction of the nervous sys - tem, to assure lack of sensory perception and death of the animal. The diversity of invertebrate taxa may require equally diverse approaches to euthanasia. S7.2.1 ACCeptABle methods S7.2.1.1 Noninhaled agents Injectable agents \u2014While there is little dosing or outcome data in the peer-reviewed literature, an overdose of pentobarbital or similar agent, at a dose equivalent to that used for other poikilotherm verte -brates (piscine, amphibian, or reptilian) on a weight- to-weight basis, will generally suffice. Ideally these agents will be injected directly into the circulating hemolymph. However, because many invertebrates have an open circulatory system, true intravascular application can be difficult if not impossible. In such cases an intracoelomic injection would be warrant - ed unless otherwise contraindicated. Premedication with an injectable or inhaled agent may facilitate ministration overdoses. S7.2.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S7.2.2.1 Inhaled agents Inhaled anesthetics \u2014Overdose of an inhaled an - esthetic is acceptable with conditions for terrestrial invertebrates where injectable agents are not avail - able. Because confirming death of many species of invertebrates can be difficult, subsequent use of an adjunctive method of euthanasia is recommended. Carbon dioxide \u2014Carbon dioxide may be useful for euthanasia of some terrestrial invertebrates, but additional information is needed to confirm its effi - cacy. S7.2.2.2 Acceptable first steps of 2-step methods Two-step euthanasia procedures, as described for aquatic invertebrates, are acceptable for some or many species of invertebrates. Recent research docu - mented the efficacy of immersion in 5% laboratory- grade ethanol or an undiluted, uncarbonated beer (5% content) served to anesthetize land snails (Succinea putris ) without signs of distress as a first- step procedure.335 This was followed by immersion in solutions of 70% to 95% ethanol or neutral-buffered 10% formalin that served to euthanize snails and pre - serve tissue. Further research is needed to establish the general validity of applying this 2-step method and other methods to terrestrial invertebrate species. S7.2.2.3 Physical and chemical methods Physical (eg, boiling, freezing, pithing) and chem - ical (eg, alcohol, formalin) methods act by destroy - ing the brain or major ganglia. Physical and chemical methods should be applied adjunctively, following pharmaceutical or other chemical induction of an - esthesia, nonresponsiveness, or presumptive death. These methods are not considered to be humane as sole methods of euthanasia.345,346,350,351 Pithing \u2014This method requires detailed anatom - ic knowledge of the species in question. S7.2.3 unACC eptABle methods Because information on the physiologic respons - es of invertebrates to many methods of euthanasia is not available at this time, comments regarding unac - ceptable methods of euthanasia are limited to those that should not be applied as sole methods of eutha - nasia (see comments under Acceptable With Condi - tions Methods).92 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONs7.2.4 d evelopment Al stAges of Inve RteBRA tes Recommendations for euthanasia of invertebrates in developmental stages are currently not available. S7.3 CAPTIVE AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES S7.3.1 AnAtomy And phys Iology Amphibians and reptiles include caecilians (or - der Gymnophiona), frogs (order Chelonia). Once again, these taxonomic groups differ substantially anatomically and physiologically from each other, as well as from mammals. Of particular concern for am - phibians and reptiles are differences in metabolism and high tolerances to hypoxia, as compared with mammals, that limit the effectiveness of methods based on anoxia. In addition, consistent access to the vasculature can be challenging and, therefore, many conventional methods of euthanasia are less effica - cious for these species. Because it is often difficult to confirm that an amphibian or reptile is dead, the ap - plication of 2 or more euthanasia procedures is usu - ally recommended.293,352-354 Our understanding of amphibians' and reptiles' nociception and responses to stimuli is incomplete; therefore, many recommendations for minimizing pain and distress are extrapolated from information available about mammals. Where uncertainty exists, erring to proactively alleviate potential pain and suf - fering is recommended as an appropriate approach to euthanizing amphibians and reptiles. Consulting mul - tiple references on amphibian and reptile euthanasia is advised as a means of identifying methods that are most appropriate for a given species and set of cir - cumstances.116,293,294,352-356 S7.3.2 RestRAInt Physical restraint \u2014Manual restraint is possible for many species. Equipment may be required for re - straint of some species in some situations (eg, ven - omous species). Multiple people may be required for larger species, and at least 1 additional person should be available for emergencies. Large animals may rep - resent a proportionately greater risk for personnel. Chemical restraint \u2014Chemical restraint may be useful in some situations, particularly for venomous or large animals where human safety would be com - promised by manual restraint. Chemical restraint at high doses may serve as a first or preparatory step of euthanasia in some situations. S7.3.3 veRIfICAtIon of deAth Methods used to verify death in mammalian spe - cies, such as auscultation, ECG, Doppler ultrasound, or pulse oximetry, can be used for amphibians and reptiles, but it is important to remember that amphib -ian and reptilian hearts can beat even after brain death. Death should always be confirmed by physical intervention. S7.3.4 ACCeptABle methods S7.3.4.1 Noninhaled agents Injectable agents \u2014Venous access for administra - tion of euthanasia agents can be challenging for some species. Intracoelomic, subcutaneous lymph spaces, and lymph sacs are acceptable routes of administra - tion. Direct injection into the brain through the pari - etal eye, while under anesthesia, has been described for some lizard species.357 Sodium pentobarbital (60 to 100 mg/kg of body weight) can be administered IV, intracoelomically, in the subcutaneous lymph spaces, or in the lymph sacs, although doses vary by species.358 Doses as high as 1,100 mg/kg (500 mg/lb) of sodium pentobarbital with sodium phenytoin administered intracoelomi - cally may be required for euthanasia of some species such as X laevis .116 Time to effect may vary, with death occurring instantaneously or up to 30 minutes later.293,352-354,359,360 Barbiturates are best administered intravascularly to minimize the discomfort upon in - jection.361 However, where intravascular administra - tion is not possible or its benefits are outweighed by distress imposed by additional restraint, pain from alternate methods, risk to personnel, or other similar reasons, intracoelomic administration is an accept - able route for administration of barbiturates. Dissociative agents such as ketamine hydrochlo - ride or combinations such as tiletamine and zolaze - pam; inhaled agents; and IV administered anesthet - ics, such as propofol, or other ultra-short-acting bar - biturates, may be used for poikilotherms to induce rapid general anesthesia and subsequent euthanasia, although application of an adjunctive method to en - sure death is recommended. External or topical agents \u2014Buffered MS 222 may be administered via water baths (amphibians), or injected directly into the lymph sacs (amphibians) or the coelomic cavity (small amphibians and rep - tiles).362-365 Prolonged immersion (as long as 1 hour) may be required for 5- to 10-g/L water baths.116,358 Tricaine methanesulfonate does not create histopath - ologic artifacts.362 See the Noninhaled Agents section of the Guidelines for additional information. Benzocaine hydrochloride, a compound similar to MS 222, may be used as a bath or in a recircula - tion system at concentrations 250 mg/L or applied topically to the ventrum as a 7.5% or 20% gel for eu - thanasia of amphibians.366 A dose of 182 mg/kg of benzocaine gel (20% concentration, 2.0-cm X 1.0- mm application) has been reported as effective for euthanasia of adult X laevis .116 Pure benzocaine is not water soluble and should be avoided for anesthesia or euthanasia because it requires the use of acetone or ethanol solvents, which may be irritating to tissues.367 In general, these noninhaled agents are highly ef - fective, their onset of action is rapid, and they are ap - AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 93plicable across a range of species and sizes of animals. However, general anesthesia may be required prior to administration, some require IV administration for vessels that may be difficult to access, they may produce undesirable tissue artifacts, a controlled sub - stance license is required for barbiturates and some other products, and there may be environmental pol - lution and toxicity concerns depending on method of disposal of the remains. S7.3.5 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S7.3.5.1 Inhaled agents Inhaled anesthetics \u2014Inhaled anesthetics are acceptable with conditions when they are more practical than the previously mentioned acceptable methods, and where the limitations of this method are understood and addressed. Many reptiles and am - phibians are capable of breath holding and shunting of their blood, which permits conversion to anaero - bic metabolism for survival during prolonged periods of anoxia (up to 27 hours for some species).368-373 Because of this, induction of anesthesia and time to loss of consciousness may be greatly prolonged when inhaled agents are used. Death may not occur even with prolonged exposure.293,352-354 Lizards and most snakes do not hold their breath to the same extent as some of the chelonians, and are therefore more likely to have a clinical response to inhaled agents. Regard - less of the species or taxonomic group, death must be verified prior to terminating the use of the inhaled agent, or a second, guaranteed lethal procedure (eg, decapitation) should be performed to ensure death. Inhaled anesthetics are effective, have a moder - ately rapid onset, appear to induce a painless death, can maximize use of the euthanized animal for ana - lytical studies, and can minimize the need for animal handling. Caveats include that inhaled anesthetics are most suitable for smaller species, animals may experience an excitation phase prior to becoming anesthetized, they present environmental pollution and occupational hazard concerns, some are irritants or are perceived as noxious, and amphibians and rep - tiles may be resistant to their action because of breath holding. Carbon dioxide \u2014Carbon dioxide may be con - sidered for euthanasia of amphibians and reptiles if alternate methods are not practical and where the limitations of this method are understood and ad - dressed.293,294,352-354,356 Due to the potential lack of response to this method by many species and the requirement for a prolonged exposure time, other methods are preferable. Death by CO2 must be veri - fied, and preferably, assured by application of a sec - ondary lethal procedure. S7.3.5.2 Physical methods PCB or firearm \u2014Crocodilians and other large reptiles can be euthanized by a PCB or gunshot (free bullet) delivered to the brain.355,374 Nonpenetrating captive bolt can be effective for euthanasia of Ameri -can alligators374 that are 5 to 15 kg (11 to 33 lb), and further research is needed to establish this method's general applicability to large reptilian and amphib - ian species. Line drawings of the head of various am - phibians and reptiles, with recommended locations for captive bolt or firearm projectile penetration, are available (Figure 26) .356 Refer to ballistics details in the Physical Methods section and experts for more information on selection and use of firearms. These methods are moderately rapid (allow - ing for restraint), are applicable across a wide range of species and sizes, and leave no environmental residues other than lead (in the case of free bullet), which can be sequestered. However, size-appropriate equipment and appropriately trained personnel are required, violent muscle contractions can occur fol - lowing their application, and they may be aestheti - cally unpleasant for onlookers. Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head \u2014This method is acceptable with conditions, when other options are unavailable, as long as it is performed by well-trained and skilled personnel and if an adjunctive method, such as decapitation or pith - ing, is promptly applied to ensure death.95,336,352,366 Further research is needed to clarify methods, taxa, and size ranges where this method is effective and humane. Rapid freezing \u2014Reptiles and amphibians can be euthanized by rapid freezing when it results in imme - diate death. Based on rodent models, it is likely that this can be achieved by placing animals < 4 g (0.1 oz) in liquid N2.95 However, due to a dearth of empirical evidence supporting this method, operators should consider a secondary method to ensure that recovery does not occur. The technique should not be used for species that have adapted freeze tolerance strate - gies, as this method may not result in instant death.375 Placement of animals 4 g in liquid N2 or other uses of hypothermia are not acceptable. Spinal cord severance followed by destruction of brain tissue \u2014Death can be humanely and effec - tively induced in 5- to 15-kg American alligators by spinal cord severance promptly followed by pithing of the brain when operators are trained and skilled in the procedure.374 This method may be appropriate for some sizes of other reptile and amphibian species, but further research is needed to confirm this. De - struction of brain tissue after spinal cord severance can also be achieved by use of PCB or NPCB, and this approach may be less prone to operator error when equipment is in good working order. S7.3.6 Adjun CtIve methods Decapitation \u2014After animals have been anesthe - tized, decapitation using heavy shears or a guillotine is effective for some species. It has been assumed that stopping blood supply to the brain by decapitation causes rapid loss of consciousness. However, because the CNS of reptiles and amphibians is tolerant to hy - poxic and hypotensive conditions,356 decapitation 94 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONmust be followed by pithing or another method of de - stroying brain tissue.352,354,361,374 Decapitation should only be performed as part of a 3-step euthanasia pro - tocol (injectable anesthetic, decapitation, pithing). Pithing \u2014Pithing can be used as a second-step euthanasia method in unconscious animals when performed by properly trained individuals.352,354 The pithing site in frogs is the foramen magnum, and it is identified by a slight midline skin depression poste - rior to the skull, midline between the eyes, the neck flexed.293,353 S7.3.7 unACC eptABle methods Hypothermia \u2014Hypothermia is an inappropriate method of restraint or euthanasia for amphibians and reptiles unless animals are sufficiently small ( < 4 g)95 to permit immediate and irreversible death if placed in liquid N2 (rapid freezing).352,354,361 Hypothermia re - duces amphibians' tolerance for noxious stimuli376,377 and there is no evidence that it is clinically efficacious for euthanasia.378 In addition, it is believed that freez - ing can result in the formation of ice crystals in tis - sues that may cause pain.95,356 Consequently, because amphibians and reptiles lack behavioral or physi - ologic means of demonstrating pain or distress while hypothermic, generalized prohibitions on hypother - mia for restraint or euthanasia are appropriate. Lo - calized cooling in frogs may reduce nociception, but this localized effect is not appropriately applied to the whole body as a part of euthanasia procedures.379 Freezing of deeply anesthetized animals may be justi - fied under circumstances where human safety could be compromised.380 S7.3.8 speCIAl CAses And exCeptIons Intracardiac administration of euthanasia agents is acceptable for captive amphibians and reptiles that are unresponsive to stimuli because of disease or the application of other euthanasia methods, or in cases where other routes are not possible. Neuromuscular blocking agents may be used for routine anesthetic procedures of crocodilians and some other taxa and are, therefore, considered acceptable with conditions for restraint of reptiles if given immediately prior to administration of a le - thal agent. These agents are not acceptable as a sole means of euthanasia. Injectable agents such as lidocaine hydrochlo - ride, potassium salts, or magnesium salts may be use - ful as an adjunctive method to prevent recovery.354 Perfusion with fixative of a deeply anesthetized animal can be used to euthanize amphibians and rep - tiles when scientifically justified. S7.3.9 destRuCtIon of vIABle eggs Little information is available on the sensory ca - pacity of amphibians and reptiles at the egg stage of development.95 Freezing is likely appropriate for new - ly oviposited eggs, as would be methods of macera - tion that result in instantaneous death. Later stages may be destroyed using methods that are acceptable for adult animals. More research needs to be done to determine the most appropriate methods for dispos - ing of live eggs. S7.4 CAPTIVE NONMARINE MAMMALS S7.4.1 gene RAl Cons IdeRAtIons The anatomic, physiologic, behavioral, and size variations of nondomestic mammals far exceed those of their domestic counterparts. This presents chal - lenges for the application of conventional methods of euthanasia and the recognition of anxiety and pain. Differences from similar domestic species must be recognized and addressed as thoroughly as practical when preparing for and performing euthanasia. In zoos or other captive settings, euthanasia of wildlife is typically performed in the presence of staff members who are responsible for caring for these an - imals. Consequently, sensitivity to the meaning and value to caregivers of animals in this kind of setting is important. This can be addressed, in part, with at - tention to stewardship, and relief from pain and anxi - ety prior to administration of a euthanasia method. Most euthanasia procedures should include the use of inhaled or injectable anesthetics to achieve uncon - sciousness, followed by use of an approved method to end life. In some cases animals may experience intoler - able suffering, or the situation may not allow for ideal stewardship as a prelude to the act of euthanasia. These situations typically require a more direct ap - proach to limit how much an animal is allowed to suffer. Such situations also require a brief explana - tion to personnel, where possible, as well as a more complete explanation of the choice of method sub - sequent to completion of the procedure. Preparing staff ahead of time to be cognizant of the possibility of these kinds of situations will likewise help to bet - ter prepare for situations where a more ideal proce - dure is not feasible. Alternate approved methods of euthanasia might be applicable if an animal is anesthetized prior to eu - thanasia. Any candidate method not specifically men - tioned in the text that follows should be evaluated conceptually to address good stewardship principles prior to its use. Following euthanasia, verification of death is im - portant. Methods that can be used for verification of cessation of cardiac function include, but may not be limited to, palpation for a pulse in an appropriate ana - tomic location based on species, auscultation with a stethoscope, and use of Doppler ultrasound. S7.4.2 RestRAInt Physical restraint \u2014Manual restraint is possible for many species. Nets or other equipment may be appropriate for smaller species that do not pose an excessive risk for personnel. For the largest species (hoofstock and megavertebrates), chutes or other AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 95equipment may provide sufficient restraint for IM or IV administration of anesthetics and/or anxiolytics. Brief restraint followed by IV administration of a eu - thanasia agent may be possible as an approach to eu - thanasia in some situations. However, administration of a preanesthetic or sedatives before administration of a euthanasia agent should be the default in most cases. Chemical restraint \u2014Chemical restraint may be useful in some situations, particularly for dangerous animals where human safety would be compromised with manual restraint, as well as to reduce unneces - sary stress and discomfort for the animal(s). Chemi - cal restraint at high doses may serve as the first step of euthanasia in some situations.8,340-342 s7.4.3 A CCeptABle methods S7.4.3.1 Noninhaled agents Barbiturates \u2014Barbiturates may be administered IV or IP. Intracardiac administration must be limited to animals that are unconscious due to disease or the effects of anesthetics. Onset of action is slower with IP administration and premedication with anesthet - ics may reduce discomfort due to tissue irritation. Barbiturates are best administered intravascularly to minimize discomfort upon injection.361 However, where intravascular administration is not possible or its benefits are outweighed by distress imposed by ad - ditional restraint, pain from alternate methods, risk to personnel, or other similar reasons, IP administra - tion is an acceptable route for administration of bar - biturates. Barbiturates are highly effective as euthanasia agents, have a rapid onset of action, and are appli - cable across a wide range of species and sizes of ani - mals. However, they do have drawbacks, including that individuals must be trained to correctly admin - ister injections, general anesthesia or sedation with injectable or inhaled agents may be required prior to their administration (depending on the animal and the situation), they can produce undesirable tissue ar - tifacts, a controlled substance license is required for their acquisition, and environmental pollution and toxicity may be of concern depending on the method used to dispose of animal remains. Nonbarbiturate anesthetic overdose \u2014Opioids and other anesthetics may be administered IV or IM for euthanasia when animal size, restraint require - ments, or other circumstances indicate these drugs are the best option for euthanasia. Intramuscular administration of opioids is advan - tageous when other routes of administration are not available. Opioids tend to have a rapid onset of action, and the volume of drug to be administered may be smaller than for other agents. There are also disad - vantages associated with administering an overdose of opioids, including requirements for DEA licensing, risks to human safety if exposure to drugs occurs, and the potential for secondary toxicity if tissues are consumed.S7.4.4 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S7.4.4.1 Inhaled agents Inhaled anesthetics \u2014Inhaled anesthetics are ac - ceptable with conditions when they are more practi - cal than acceptable methods, and where the limita - tions of this method are understood and addressed. Inhaled anesthetics may be administered via face mask or chambers. Placing an animal's entire crate into a chamber will allow anesthesia to be induced with the least amount of distress. As discussed in the Inhaled Agents section of the Guidelines, agents with minimal odor are preferred. Inhaled anesthetics have a moderately rapid on - set of action, do not appear to cause pain on admin - istration, maximize the availability of the animal's remains for analytical studies, and can be applied with minimal handling of the animal. They also, how - ever, have some disadvantages in that they are most suitable for smaller species, some are irritants or are perceived as noxious, animals can experience an ex - citation phase prior to induction of anesthesia, and they may present environmental pollution and occu - pational safety concerns. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and inert gases \u2014These agents are acceptable with conditions for application where animal welfare and pragmatic concerns warrant their use and risks to personnel safety can be addressed. For more information, please consult the Guidelines section on Inhaled Agents. S7.4.4.2 Physical methods PCB or firearm \u2014Use of a PCB or firearm (free bullet) may be appropriate for some species as a first step or adjunct method of euthanasia, when there is species-specific knowledge of target sites and safety considerations can be met. Advantages of these methods are that they are moderately rapid (considering application of any needed restraint), they may be relatively easily imple - mented under various conditions, they are applicable across a wide range of species and sizes, and they leave no environmental residues (other than lead, which may be sequestered). There are some disad - vantages in that they require appropriate, well-main - tained equipment and well-trained personnel, they are potentially aesthetically displeasing for observers, and they present safety risks for personnel associated with the keeping and use of firearms. Refer to bal - listics details in the section on Physical Methods and experts for more information on selection and use of firearms. S7.4.5 Adjun CtIve methods Potassium chloride \u2014Potassium chloride can be administered IV or intracardially to stop the heart of animals that are deeply anesthetized or unconscious. Potassium chloride does not create artifacts that can interfere with histopathologic examination and, therefore, its application may be appropriate when accurate postmortem diagnostic or research results 96 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONare important. Potassium chloride may also be used adjunctively for large animals that are first anesthe - tized with barbiturates, particularly where volume of administration is a limitation. In many cases sig - nificant agonal reflex activity can be avoided where barbiturates are administered prior to administration of potassium chloride. Exsanguination \u2014Exsanguination may be useful as a secondary or tertiary method to ensure death. The aesthetics of this procedure and its acceptance by personnel must be considered in its application. Cervical dislocation or decapitation \u2014Applied to small mammals and birds, this method may be use - ful as an adjunct or as a first-step method of eutha - nasia. A paucity of data for wildlife and the potential for interspecies variation creates challenges for es - tablishing specific size recommendations. However, based on domestic animals, manual cervical disloca - tion may be appropriate for birds < 3 kg (6.6 lb), ro - dents < 200 g (0.44 lb), and rabbits < 1 kg (2.2 lb).365 A secondary method such as decapitation or exsan - guination should be employed to ensure death when feasible. Thoracic compression \u2014Thoracic compression may be useful in rare circumstances in animals that are deeply anesthetized or otherwise unconscious, or as a final, confirmatory step when the animal's status is uncertain. S7.4.6 unACC eptABle methods Methods that are classified as being unaccept - able for use in comparable domestic species are unac - ceptable for use in wild mammals that are not deeply anesthetized. S7.4.7 emBRyos, fetuses , And neon Ates Euthanasia of embryos, fetuses, and neonates should be conducted using guidelines appropriate for taxonomically similar domestic mammals. S7.5 CAPTIVE MARINE MAMMALS Due to their unique anatomic and physiologic adaptations for aquatic environments, the large size of some species, and the challenges associated with performing euthanasia under typical circumstances, marine mammals are considered separately from oth - er mammals. To facilitate making appropriate recom - mendations regarding euthanasia, marine mammals have been divided into physiologically and anatomi - cally distinct groups. These groups follow taxonom - ic lines to some extent, though it is appropriate to consider the sea otter (a large mustelid) with small pinnipeds: 1) pinnipeds, 2) odontocetes, 3) mysti - cetes, and 4) sirinids. Methods addressed under S7.4 Captive Nonmarine Mammals are applicable to polar bears and therefore will not be addressed in this sec - tion. Sizes of the animals vary dramatically among and within these groups and each group should mini - mally be divided into subgroups by size (large and small). Recommendations for euthanasia of marine mammals in managed care facilities differ from those used for free-ranging marine mammals, because of differences in environment and facilities, restraint ca - pabilities, and personnel and observers. S7.5.1 ACCeptABle methods S7.5.1.1 Noninhaled agents Intravenous administration of barbiturates and their derivatives can be a rapid and reliable method of euthanasia for small pinnipeds, small odontoce - tes, and sirinids. Intraperitoneal administration is also acceptable where intravascular administration is not possible or is outweighed by distress from the requirement of additional restraint, pain from alter - nate methods, risk to personnel, or other similar rea - sons, although tissue irritation and variable absorp - tion rates must be considered. Safe and effective IV administration of these agents may also be possible in anesthetized, moribund, or unconscious large pinnipeds and in large odontocetes. For the largest odontocetes, drug dilution in large volumes may limit the effectiveness of euthanasia agents administered IV. Intracardiac administration is acceptable only in anesthetized, moribund, or unconscious animals. The advantage of using barbiturates is that death is usually rapid. Unfortunately, voluntary peripheral vasoconstriction by cetaceans or hypovolemic shock may limit access to peripheral veins. There is also a risk of injury for personnel attempting venipuncture if animals are not restrained. Furthermore tissue resi - dues can present challenges for disposal of the ani - mal's remains and personnel are responsible for en - suring that secondary toxicity does not occur. Intramuscular administration of sedatives or an - esthetics may be required to immobilize large, anx - ious, or fractious animals to ensure animal and per - sonnel safety prior to administration of IV euthana - sia agents. Agents that have successfully been used alone or in combination for this purpose include tiletamine-zolazepam, ketamine, xylazine, meperi - dine, fentanyl, midazolam, diazepam, acepromazine, and etorphine.381 Veterinarians should be aware that administration of anesthetics or sedatives in fat layers can result in prolonged time to effect and diminished depth of sedation and anesthesia. In addition, tissue residues, particularly when ultrapotent opioids are administered, need to be considered when disposing of the animal's remains.382 S7.5.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond marine mammals because these animals' ability to breath-hold means that ex - tended periods of physical restraint are necessary for their administration. Extended restraint generally poses unacceptable risks and stress for the animal and for personnel unless the animal is substantially AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 97debilitated, sedated, or anesthetized. Use of inhaled agents may be appropriate for small pinnipeds after administration of an injectable sedative or anesthetic under circumstances where acceptable methods are not practical or appropriate for other reasons. Inhaled agents present some advantages in that they do not require phlebotomy skills and may pres - ent minimal concern for tissue residues.383 Disadvan - tages include that they are expensive, require an ex - tended delivery time with associated risks of distress and injury for animals and personnel, and may be noxious to the animal. S7.5.2.2 Physical methods Physical methods, although used to euthanize free-ranging marine mammals, will generally not be used on captive mammals due to limited efficacy for these species, risk for personnel, and aesthetics. S7.6 FREE-RANGING WILDLIFE S7.6.1 gene RAl Cons IdeRAtIons Free-ranging wildlife are present in all habitats across North America including fresh and salt water. Wildlife includes representatives of all known animal taxa, but for the purpose of the Guidelines, will be re - stricted to amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including some feral and exotic species. Wildlife are enjoyed and used by people in a number of ways in - cluding nonconsumptive uses (wildlife viewing, bird watching, bird feeding) and legal harvest (hunting, fishing, commercial take). Varied interests and per - spectives can influence what methods are used to terminate the lives of free-ranging wildlife.384 This section of the Guidelines updates and expands upon previous editions by recognizing an inherent lack of control over free-ranging wildlife, accepting that fire - arms may be the most appropriate approach to their euthanasia, and acknowledging that the quickest and most humane means of terminating the life of free- ranging wildlife in a given situation may not always meet all criteria established for euthanasia (ie, distin - guishes between euthanasia and methods that are more accurately characterized as humane killing). Because of the variety of situations that may be encountered, it is difficult to strictly classify methods for termination of free-ranging wildlife as acceptable, acceptable with conditions, or unacceptable. Further - more, classification of a given method as a means of euthanasia or humane killing may vary by circum - stances. These acknowledgments are not intended to condone a lower standard for the humane termina - tion of wildlife. The best methods possible under the circumstances must be applied, and new technology and methods demonstrated to be superior to previ - ously used methods must be embraced. Multiple federal, state, and local regulations ap - ply to the euthanasia of wildlife. In the United States, management of wildlife is primarily under state juris - diction. However, some species (eg, migratory birds, endangered species, marine mammals) are protected and managed by federal agencies or through collabo -ration between state and federal agencies. Within the context of wildlife management, personnel associat - ed with state and federal agencies and Native Ameri - can tribes may handle or capture individual animals or groups of animals for various purposes, including research. During the course of these management ac - tions, individual animals may become injured or de - bilitated and may require euthanasia; in other cases, research or collection protocols dictate that some of them be killed. Sometimes population management requires the lethal control of wildlife species. And, the public may identify and/or present individual ani - mals to state or federal personnel because they are or - phaned, sick, injured, diseased (eg, rabid), or becom - ing a nuisance. Another aspect of wildlife manage - ment is rehabilitation of orphaned or injured wildlife. For the most part, wildlife rehabilitation is done by private citizens and requirements for handling these animals vary by state and species. S7.6.2 speCIAl Cons IdeRAtIons The primary factor influencing methods selected for euthanasia of free-ranging wildlife is lack of con - trol over the animal. In addition, some species may be too large to effectively euthanize by conventional means. Marine mammals are of particular concern due to their large size and the lack of standardized equipment and techniques (see Free-Ranging Marine Mammals for more information). Other species, such as reptiles, may be refractory to conventional eutha - nasia agents. The potential for secondary toxicity and environmental hazards associated with the remains of animals euthanized by chemical means are of sub - stantial concern, as is disposal of large or numerous animal remains. Therefore, while some methods de - scribed in the taxonomically based sections for non - domestic animals may be useful for euthanizing free- ranging wildlife, their applicability will vary. Given that close human contact is stressful and difficult to achieve for most free-ranging animals, these animals may have to be euthanized or immo - bilized from a distance. In some cases (eg, suburban areas), discharge of a firearm is illegal, is considered a serious threat to human safety, or may be inappro - priate for other reasons. Consequently, free-ranging animals may need to be killed quickly and efficiently in ways that may not fulfill the criteria for euthanasia established by the POE. Remotely delivered chemical immobilization may be required when wildlife cannot be captured. If a free-ranging animal is within an acceptable range, trained individuals may use species and situation-spe - cific anesthetic agents and remote injection equip - ment to anesthetize that animal to allow handling. Once anesthetized, many wildlife species can be eu - thanized via methods similar to those applied to do - mestic or captive wild animals of similar species and size. Other techniques used in wildlife management for trapping or capturing animals may also be applied to allow some degree of control over the animal.98 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONCare must be taken to prevent secondary intoxi - cation of animals or people during disposal of the re - mains of free-ranging wildlife that contain residues of euthanasia agents. This is a legal requirement that often requires deep burial, incineration, or render - ing. In other situations, however, natural decomposi - tion may be desirable. Use of gunshot can minimize concerns for secondary toxicity, with the exception of lead ballistics. Alternatives to lead ballistics are rec - ommended where possible. Although not typically a part of wildlife manage - ment programs, disease outbreaks or overpopulation may require culling or large-scale killing of animals. In addition to selecting the most appropriate meth - ods for minimizing spread of infectious agent, pro - tecting animal welfare, and protecting the environ - ment, such situations must consider the concerns and perceptions of the general public, as well as impacts upon personnel who are directly involved in culling, killing, or euthanasia. Detailed information about de - population methods is beyond the scope of this docu - ment, but is available in the AVMA Guidelines for the Depopulation of Animals.288 Research objectives may limit the use of some euthanasia agents or methods for wildlife species. Nevertheless, termination of life still dictates that the most humane, rather than the most convenient, methods be used to meet the study's objectives. Within the context of wildlife rehabilitation, eu - thanasia of individual animals must be considered if a fully functional animal cannot be returned to the wild, if the release of such animals would pose a threat to the health of the free-ranging wildlife popu - lation, or if no alternatives for care or housing exist. While there are a limited number of nonreleasable animals that can be used for educational or display purposes, most animals that are determined to be unfit for release should be euthanized as soon as pos - sible. Because most animals in rehabilitation facili - ties are confined, adequate control through physical or chemical restraint can usually be achieved that will allow administration of euthanasia agents as de - scribed in the taxonomically based sections for non - domestic animals. S7.6.3 methods Little published information is available regard - ing appropriate methods for euthanasia of specific species of free-ranging wildlife. Schwartz et al385 eval- uated immobilization Needham387 described eutha - nasia methods for captive or stranded marine mam - mals, and the euthanasia of waterfowl was described by Gullett388 and Franson.252 Methods for euthanasia of wildlife in rehabilitation facilities have also been described.283 While multiple publications describe eutha - nasia methods for domestic and nondomestic ani - mals,95,251,271,336,337 as well as for wildlife under free- ranging conditions,389-392 their recommendations are inconsistent. Many conventional euthanasia tech - niques and methods can be applied to free-ranging wildlife, if the animals are sufficiently under the con - trol of personnel. However, because of the variety of conditions under which euthanasia of free-ranging wildlife may need to be conducted, choice of the most humane method will vary by species, situation, and individual animal. Conditions specified for use of various methods in previous sections will generally apply to free-ranging wildlife, but may be modified according to circumstances to minimize animal dis - tress and pain, as well as emotional impact and physi - cal risks to personnel. S7.6.3.1 Acceptable methods S7.6.3.1.1 Noninhaled agents Chemical methods of euthanasia applicable to free-ranging wildlife include overdoses of injectable anesthetic agents (including barbiturates), T-61, or other agents that are listed as acceptable for domestic animals or captive wildlife. Premedication with an in - jectable or inhaled agent may reduce animal distress and/or human safety risks, under some circumstanc - es. S7.6.3.2 Acceptable with conditions methods S7.6.3.2.1 Inhaled agents Inhaled anesthetics \u2014Inhaled anesthetics are ac - ceptable with conditions for euthanasia of avian and mammalian wildlife species when these methods are more practical than acceptable methods, and where the limitations of this method are understood and ad - dressed.. Smaller species that can be confined in en - closed containers can be euthanized using open-drop methods of administration.393 Larger species may be restrained for face-mask administration, when animal distress associated with restraint can be minimized. Portable equipment is available that can make these methods practical. Preference should be given to the use of alternate methods for taxa that can breath-hold for extended periods of time. Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other inert gases \u2014These agents, which are classified as be - ing acceptable with conditions for domestic animals, are also acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of free-ranging wildlife. Conditions that must be met for using these agents are similar to those for domestic animals. S7.6.3.2.2 Physical methods Gunshot is acceptable with conditions for eu - thanasia of free-ranging, captured, or confined wild - life, provided that bullet placement is to the head (targeted to destroy the brain).337 Gunshot targeted to the heart (chest) or to the neck (vertebrae, with the intent of severing the spinal cord) presents chal - lenges for accurate placement, but may be the best option for free-ranging or other settings where close approach is not possible or where the head must be preserved for disease testing (rabies, chronic wast - ing, or other suspected neurologic diseases). Based on domestic animal models (see section of the Guide - lines addressing Farmed Animals Used for Food and AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 99Fiber), gunshot to the chest or neck may not result in rapid death and may be considered humane killing, rather than euthanasia. In some environments (eg, ur - ban and suburban areas), discharge of a firearm may present a serious threat to human safety and may be inappropriate. Refer to ballistics details in the Physi - cal Methods section and experts for more informa - tion on selection and use of firearms. S7.6.3.3 Adjunctive methods Potassium chloride \u2014Potassium chloride may be administered IV or intracardially to stop the heart of animals that are deeply anesthetized or unconscious. Administration of potassium chloride can also be pre - ferred for large animals when administered with bar - biturates, where volume of administration is a limita - tion. Exsanguination \u2014Bleeding may be used as an adjunctive method to ensure the death of animals that are anesthetized or otherwise unconscious. The aesthetics of this procedure and its acceptance by personnel and observers should be considered. Cervical dislocation or decapitation \u2014Applied to small mammals and birds, this method may be use - ful as an adjunct or as a first-step method of euthana - sia. A paucity of data for wildlife and the potential for interspecies variation create challenges for establish - ing specific size recommendations. However, on the basis of data for domestic animals, manual cervical dislocation without the use of tools may be appropri - ate for birds < 3 kg, rodents < 200 g, and rabbits < 1 kg.365 A secondary method such as decapitation or exsanguination should be employed to ensure death when feasible. Thoracic compression \u2014Thoracic compression may be useful in rare circumstances in animals that are deeply anesthetized or otherwise unconscious, or as a final, confirmatory method to ensure death when the animal's status is uncertain.273 S7.6.3.4 Unacceptable methods Approaches to euthanasia that ignore recent ad - vances in technology, and that do not minimize risks to animal welfare, personnel safety, and the environ - ment for a particular set of circumstances, are unac - ceptable. S7.6.4 emBRyos, fetuses , And neon Ates Methods that are acceptable for euthanasia of do - mestic or captive wildlife species in developmental or neonatal stages are generally acceptable for eutha - nasia of similar stages of free-ranging wildlife. S7.7 FREE-RANGING MARINE MAMMALS Selecting a method of euthanasia for free-ranging marine mammals can be a substantial challenge be - cause of large body size, environmental constraints, and concerns for the safety of personnel. It can also be difficult to determine when stranded marine mam - mals are unconscious or dead.394 Currently available euthanasia methods generally have significant limita -tions that fail to meet aesthetic or other conventional standards for euthanasia of marine mammals under field conditions, particularly for large animals. Nev - ertheless, the options available must be evaluated to identify the best option under a given set of circum - stances. Further research is warranted to identify im - proved methods of euthanasia. S7.7.1 ACCeptABle methods S7.7.1.1 Noninhaled agents Injectable agents \u2014Overdoses of injectable anesthetics can be used to euthanize marine mam - mals under field conditions. Anesthetics that can be used alone or in combination include tiletamine-zo - lar administration of anesthetics may be required to achieve restraint of conscious animals before person - nel can safely perform euthanasia using injectable agents by an intravascular route. A clear understand - ing of species anatomy and use of sufficiently long needles are required to ensure that muscle, rather than fat, is the site of injection. Injectable anesthetics may be administered by multiple routes. Mucocutaneous administration, via the blowhole, can be an effective method that maxi - mizes personnel safety.396 Intravenous administration can be rapid and reliable for small pinnipeds, small odontocetes, and sirinids. For larger animals, safe IV administration is generally limited to animals that are anesthetized or unconscious. In addition, drug dilu - tion in large blood volumes of large odontocetes and mysticetes may limit the effectiveness of IV admin - istered agents. Intraperitoneal administration can be effective for small marine mammals if sufficiently long needles are available to access the peritoneal cavity. However, delayed absorption may limit the ef - ficacy of drugs administered via this route. Intracardi - ac administration is acceptable only in anesthetized, moribund, or unconscious animals. This approach requires special, strong, and long needles to ensure that the heart can be accessed. Advantages of injectable anesthetics are that they act rapidly and personnel experienced with these methods are readily available. Their administration is logistically simple and aesthetically acceptable in small to medium-sized animals, and public safety is relatively easy to secure. However, voluntary periph - eral vasoconstriction by cetaceans or hypovolemic shock may limit access to peripheral veins and fat layers must be bypassed for effective administration. Large quantities of drug may be required to effec - tively euthanize large animals, and administration of single types of agents, such as 2-adrenergic receptor agonists, can result in animals passing through aes - thetically displeasing and potentially unsafe excita - tion phases of anesthesia. There is a risk of injury for personnel attempting to access veins if animals are not appropriately restrained, and personnel may also 100 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITIONface self-administration risks (especially for ultrapo - tent opioids). Environmental contamination and scav - enger exposure are possible due to residues in the animal's remains. S7.7.2 ACCeptABle wIth Cond ItIons methods S7.7.2.1 Physical methods Gunshot \u2014Gunshot is acceptable with condi - tions for euthanizing small marine mammals when injectable methods are not practical; conventional projectile ballistics are not recommended for use in large odontocetes or large mysticetes. References are available to assist in identifying appropriate anatomic landmarks and caliber of ballistics.397-403 Advantages of gunshot include a rapid death and equipment that is generally readily available. Gun - shot also poses minimal risk for other animals that may scavenge the animal's remains. However, its ef - ficacy is highly dependent on the knowledge, techni - cal expertise, and experience of the operator. Associ - ated noise can distress other animals (especially in the case of mass strandings) and ricochet poses a risk to bystanders. Euthanasia by gunshot may also be aes - thetically displeasing and emotionally distressing for personnel and bystanders. Compliance with firearm regulations is also required. Refer to details for bal - listics in the Physical Methods section and experts for more information on selection and use of firearms. Manually applied blunt force trauma \u2014In situ - ations where other options are not available, a con - cussive blow to the head may be an effective method of euthanasia for small juvenile marine mammals.404 The advantages of properly applied manual blunt force trauma are that it results in rapid death, no spe - cial equipment is required, and there is limited poten - tial for secondary toxicity for scavengers. However, the efficacy of manually applied blunt force trauma is highly dependent on knowledge and experience of the operator and it is aesthetically displeasing for per - sonnel and observers. Implosive decerebration \u2014Decerebration of large mysticetes and odontocetes can be effectively accomplished through the detonation of properly placed, shaped, and dimensioned explosive charg - es.405,406 Advantages of this technique include a rapid death, limited potential for exposure of scavengers to toxic residues, and protection of personnel from injury by tail flukes. Its efficacy, however, is highly dependent on the knowledge, skills, and experience of the operator; it is aesthetically displeasing; and personnel and bystanders must be sufficiently distant from the resulting explosion to avoid injury. If these conditions can be met, implosive decerebration is an acceptable method of euthanasia. S7.7.3 Adjun CtIve methods Potassium chloride or succinylcholine \u2014While unacceptable as sole agents of euthanasia in awake animals, potassium chloride or succinylcholine may be used to ensure the death of animals that are anes - thetized or unconscious. Saturated potassium chlo - ride solutions can be mixed inexpensively in large volumes and can be administered IV or intracardially, with a low risk of secondary toxicity for scavengers when preferred methods of disposal of the remains (eg, deep burial, rendering) are not available.381,382,407 S7.7.4 unACC eptABle methods Inhaled agents \u2014While acceptable with condi - tions from an animal welfare standpoint, practical and human and environmental safety constraints gen - erally prevent use of inhaled agents for euthanasia of marine mammals under field conditions. Exsanguination \u2014Exsanguination is inappropri - ate as a sole method of euthanasia because it requires an excessively long time to death, is believed to pro - duce anxiety associated with extreme hypovolemia, and is aesthetically displeasing to bystanders. It can, however, be used as an adjunctive method to ensure the death of unconscious animals.402 S8 Footnotes a. Mays J. Euthanasia certification (slide presentation).

Acceptable With Conditions : A method considered to reliably meet the requirements of euthanasia when specified conditions are met. See EUTHANASIA. Adjunctive Method: A method of assuring death that may be used after an animal has been made uncon - scious. Affect : The external expression of emotion. Altricial: Immobile, blind, naked young animals (in - cluding but not limited to birds and some rodents) requiring parental care and feeding. Anesthesia, General : A method used to produce uncon - sciousness. See UNCONCIOUSNESS. Animal : Any nonhuman animal (Kingdom: Animalia). Aversion : A desire to avoid or retreat from a stimulus. Avian : Relating to birds. Captive Bolt : A device used to kill or stun animals where a tethered metal rod is discharged into the brain of the animal. Chick: A young bird. Cremation : To incinerate a dead body. See INCINERA - TION. Depopulation : The rapid destruction of a population of animals in response to urgent circumstances with as much consideration given to the welfare of the animals as practicable. Distress: The effect of stimuli that initiate adaptive re - sponses that are not beneficial to the animal\u2014thus, the animal's response to stimuli interferes with its welfare and comfort. Ectotherm : An organism that is dependent on envi - ronmental heat sources for regulating its body tem - perature. Eustress : The effect of stimuli that initiate adaptive responses that are beneficial to the animal. Euthanasia : A method of killing that minimizes pain, distress, and anxiety experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciousness, and causes rapid loss of consciousness followed by cardiac or respiratory arrest and death (see sections I3, I5, I6). Exsanguination : The action of draining an animal of blood. Fear: An unpleasant emotional experience caused by an awareness of a threat of danger. Feral : A free-roaming, unowned animal of a domestic species that has reverted to wild behavior. Field Conditions: Any situation outside of a controlled or clinical environment. Finfish : a term used to describe true fish as opposed to other non-fish aquatic animals such as the invertebrates \"starfish\" and \"cuttlefish\" Good Death : see EUTHANASIA. Harvest : The act or process of killing an animal for food or other products.Humane Killing : Killing performed in a manner that minimizes animal distress, but may not meet the requirements of euthanasia due to situational con - straints. Incineration : To burn completely, to ashes. Insensible : See UNCONSCIOUS. Livestock: Domestic animals raised for use, consump - tion, or profit, typically on a farm. Nociception : Neuronal impulses generated by noxious stimuli, which threaten to, or actually do, destroy tissue. Nociception can occur without consequen - tial pain perception. Pain: A sensation (perception) that results from noci - ceptive nerve impulses reaching areas of the brain capable of conscious perception via ascending neu - ral pathways. Pithing : Physical destruction of the brain with a wire, air jet, or rod. Poikilotherm : An animal with a variable internal tem - perature. These animals are generally ectothermic. Poult : A young fowl. Poultry : Domestic fowl raised for meat or eggs, such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, or geese. Precocious : Capable of a high degree of independent activity (ie, mobility, feeding) from birth. Secondary Method : A euthanasia method employed subsequent to a primary method to ensure death of an unconscious animal before it can recover con - sciousness. See ADJUNCTIVE METHOD. Sedation : A state of CNS depression in which the ani - mal is awake but calm, and with sufficient stimuli may be aroused. Slaughter: Killing animals for the purposes of harvest - ing commodities such as meat or hides. Stress : The effect of physical, physiologic, or emotion - al factors (stressors) that induce an alteration in an animal's homeostasis or adaptive state. Stunning : Rendering an animal unconscious by use of a physical, gas, or electrical method. Suffocate : To kill by preventing access to air or oxy - gen. Unacceptable : A method that does not meet the re - quirements of euthanasia. See EUTHANASIA. Unconsciousness : Unconsciousness, defined as loss of individual awareness. This occurs when the brain's ability to integrate information is blocked or dis - rupted. Onset of unconsciousness is associated with loss of the righting reflex. An unconscious animal is therefore recumbent and, by definition, unable to perceive pain; however, unconscious ani - mals may respond to noxious stimulation with spi - nally mediated involuntary movements depending on the degree of CNS depression present. Wild: A free-roaming animal of a nondomestic spe - cies.

Air embolism Asphyxiation Burning Chloral hydrate Chloroform Cyanide Decompression (excluding low atmospheric pressure stunning when it can be demonstrated that it achieves euthanasia) Drowning Exsanguination Formaldehyde Household products and solvents Hypothermia Insulin Magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head Neuromuscular blocking agents (nicotine, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, agents) Rapid freezing Strychnine Thoracic compressionAir embolism may be accompanied by convulsions, opisthotonos, and vocalization. If used, it should be done only in anesthetized animals. Physically preventing respiration (smothering, strangulation, dewatering) is unacceptable. Chemical or thermal burning of an animal is not an acceptable method of euthanasia. Unacceptable in dogs, cats, and small mammals. Chloroform is a known hepatotoxin and suspected carcinogen and, therefore, is extremely hazardous to personnel. Cyanide poses an extreme danger to personnel and the manner of death is aesthetically objectionable. Decompression is unacceptable for euthanasia because of numerous disadvantages. (1) Many chambers are designed to produce decompression at a rate 15-60 times as fast as the recommended optimum for animals, resulting in pain and distress attributable to expanding gases trapped in body cavities. (2) Immature animals are tolerant of hypoxia, and longer periods of decompression are required before respiration ceases. (3) Accidental recompression, with recovery of injured animals, can occur. (4) Bleeding, vomiting, convulsions, urination, and defecation, which are aesthetically unpleasant, may develop in unconscious animals. Drowning is not a means of euthanasia and is inhumane. Because of the anxiety associated with extreme hypovolemia, exsanguination as a sole method of killing should be used only on unconscious animals. Direct immersion of an animal into formalin, as a means of euthanasia, is inhumane with the exception of Porifera. Acetone, cleaning agents, quaternary compounds (including CCl4), laxatives, pesticides, dimethylketone, quaternary ammonium products, antacids, and other toxicants not specifically designed for therapeutic or euthanasia use are not acceptable. Hypothermia is not an appropriate method of euthanasia. Insulin causes hypoglycemia, which can lead to considerable distress (behavior changes, irritability, disorientation) before onset of hypoglycemic seizures, which may or may not result in death. Unacceptable for use as euthanasia agents in conscious vertebrate animals. Generally unacceptable for most species excluding piglets and small laboratory animals. Replace, as much as possible, manually applied blunt force trauma to the head with alternate methods. When used alone, these drugs all cause respiratory arrest before loss of consciousness, so the animal may perceive pain and distress after it is immobilized. Rapid freezing as a sole means of euthanasia is not considered to be humane with the exception of small (< 4 g) reptiles, amphibians, and < 5-day-old rodent neonates where immediate death occurs. In all other cases animals should be rendered dead or unconscious prior to freezing. (Rapid chilling of fish is not considered to be rapid freezing). Strychnine causes violent convulsions and painful muscle contractions. Not acceptable for use on a conscious animal.

Figure 1 \u2014Veterinarians may appeal to this decision tree as a way to decide whether euthanasia is warranted when the proper course of action is not clear. Figure 2 \u2014When attempting to make the best decision possible in a thorough and balanced way, veterinar - ians may find this decision matrix helpful. It can assist in assessing the morality of euthanasia in particular cases, especially if they are less straightforward.114 AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION Figure 3 \u2014Graphic representation of the wash-in and wash- out exponential functions, using a hypothetical example of a closed container, originally filled with gas A into which gas B is introduced. The wash-in and wash-out functions are used to determine the time constant for the enclosed volume or space. The gas concentration within the container can be readily determined from the time constant, which is calculat - ed by dividing the container volume by the gas displacement rate.

The point of entry of the projectile should be at the intersection of 2 imaginary lines, each drawn from the outside corner of the eye to the center of the base of the opposite horn (A). Alternatively in long-faced cattle or young stock (B), a point on the midline of the face that is halfway between the top of the poll and an imaginary line connecting the outside corners of the eyes can be used (AVMA Guidelines for the Humane Slaughter of Animals: 2016 Edition).

A B AVMA GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS: 2020 EDITION 119 Figure 20 \u2014Anatomic site for placement of a captive bolt in turkeys (and poultry that lack comb development). The placement of the device should be directly on the midline of the skull and at the highest/widest point of the head with the captive bolt aimed directly down toward the brain. To ensure accurate captive bolt placement and to optimize the safety of the operator, the bird must be correctly restrained. In this illustration, the tip of the beak is held to enable the operator to safely and securely restrain the head of the bird while po - sitioning the captive bolt with the other hand. An additional person is required to restrain the wings and/or feet of the bird (ideally the breast of the bird should rest on a solid sur - face to keep the bird calm) during and after the application of the captive bolt. Figure 21 \u2014Anatomic site for placement of a captive bolt in chickens (and poultry with comb development). The place - ment should be directly behind the comb and on the midline of the skull with the captive bolt aimed directly down. To ensure accurate captive bolt placement and to optimize the safety of the operator, the bird must be correctly restrained. In this illustration, the comb of the bird is held to enable the operator to safely and securely restrain the head of the bird while positioning the captive bolt with the other hand. To provide additional restraint and resistance against the captive bolt strike force, the ventral portion of the bird's head should be placed against a flat surface (eg, floor or board) to ensure optimal concussion from the device. Figure 19 \u2014Shown is 1 possible anatomic site for PCB and 2 possible anatomic sites for gunshot application in swine. The frontal site may be used for both PCB and gunshot (A) and is located in the center of the forehead slightly above a line drawn between the eyes. The bolt or bullet should be direct - ed toward the spinal canal. The behind-the-ear site (B) should be used only with gunshot application, and the projectile should be toward the opposite eye. The ideal target location and direction of aim may vary slightly according to the breed and age of the animal (owing to growth of the frontal sinuses).

A captive bolt de - vice with either an NPCB or a short penetrating bolt and the smallest charge appropriate for poultry or rabbits should be applied to the top of the head at the midpoint of an imaginary line between the outer \"ear\" openings. Figure 23 \u2014Anatomic site for the application of gunshot or PCB for euthanasia of equids (A).

The finfish's size, species, and anatomy and the characteristics of the blow (including its accuracy, speed, and club mass) will determine the efficacy of manually applied blunt force trauma. The location of the blow should be targeted at the area where the brain is closest to the surface of the head and where the skull is its thinnest. Figure 25 \u2014Anatomic sites for captive bolt of large fish spe - cies. The NPCB gun has either a wide mushroom-shaped head or a flat head that does not penetrate the brain. With PCB devices (including spiking), the projectile should be di - rected into the hindbrain of the fish; there should be a focus on maximum destruction of brain tissue.
