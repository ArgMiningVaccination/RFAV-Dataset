INTRODUCTION Amongst the various theories that exist today to explain the pu rport and rationale of the patent system, the most prevalent is the \"incentive\" or the \"reward\" theory .2 In s h o r t , p a t e n t s a r e r e w a r d s i n t h e f o r m o f t e m p o r a r y m o n o p o l i e s granted to inventors who come up with new, inventive and useful ideas. The expectation is that the prospect of such rewards would incentivise inventors to com e up with a higher rate of useful inventions, than would be the case without paten ts. There is much debate on whether or not patents, in fact, foster a higher rate of new ideas, and if so, to what extent.3 More importantly, the issues are technology specific, and evidence that patents may help in an investment heavy indus try such as pharmaceuticals may not be readily transposable to industries s uch as Information Technology and semiconductors. Further, there is also the issue of developing and least developed countries that are net importers of technology. The question is whether patent regimes promote technology transfer to these cou ntries or whether t h e y e f f e c t i v e l y c u r b t h e p o t e n t i a l g r o w t h t h a t t h e s e c o u n t r i e s m i g h t h a v e experienced, had they had the freedom to imitate and learn; fre edoms that many of the developed countries enjoyed in the pre TRIPS era.4 For these countries, the potential use of patent eligibil ity exclusions is far more sign ificant in driving national policy. A brief survey of case law from developed economies would sugge st a restricted reading of eligibility exclusions.5 However, developing countries such as India opt for a wide reading of such eligibility exclusions, reflecting t heir specific national priorities.6 Although we've categorised section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act as an \"impure\" patent eligibility exclusion later in this chapter, it may help to consider this section for the purpose of this argument. Section 3(d) seeks to exclude a large number of similar chemical/pharmaceutical substances from paten tability by providing that only those derivatives that demonstrate signific antly enhanced efficacy would be patentable. This exclusion has been expensive ly interpreted by patent office and the courts: notably, the term 'efficacy' in t he explanation to Section 3(d) of the Patents Act, 1970 has been interpreted in Novartis AG & Another v. Union of India & Others, 2007 4 MLJ 1153 at \u00b6 13 to include only \"therapeutic\" efficac y, w i t h t h e r e s u l t t h a t a n u m b e r o f d e r i v a t i v e s t h a t d e m o n s t r a t e n on therapeutic 2 W.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 2 2advantages such as heat stability etc are likely to be excluded . 7 For developing countries, patent policies are not just about in creasing the rate of innovation, but are to be calibrated to take into account conce rns of \"access\" to technology goods. The question of access is most significant in t h e c o n t e x t o f pharmaceuticals and public health.8 Therefore the patent regime cannot be hermetically sealed off from other public policy concerns such as health. Indeed, one often witnesses a conflict between patent rights on the one han d, and social values, public policies and fundamental rights on the other. The issue for most countries then is to balance out these competing and often conflicting co ncerns and devise a regime that would, while furthering innovation outcomes, also n ot erode important values such as health. It is a truism that patents often cause price rises.9 A variety of tools exist to regulate such price rises and ensure affordable access to consumers, par ticularly in the context of drug patents and developing countries. Indeed most such measures revolve around expost regulatory mec hanisms such as compulsory licensing that help limit the impact of patents and i n t h e p r o c e s s promote public health goals.10 This chapter seeks to evaluate t he patent and public health int erface from the point of view of exante mechanisms i.e. ways in which countries have sought to limit the grant of patents to certain categories of subject matter in a b id to promote access to public health goods. At a conceptual level and drawing from the patenting practices of most member states, one can draw a distinction between 'patent eligibility' and 'patentability'. 'Patent eligibility' broadly refers to the requirement that a s ubject matter, for which a patent is sought, be inherently suitable for patent protectio n, in the sense of falling within the scope of subject matter that patent law prima facie exists to protect. The term 'patentability', on the other hand, refer to those set of principles that inform the requirements that must be satisfied for a patent eligible subje ct matter (i.e., an invention) to be granted a valid patent. Principally they are t he requirements of novelty, inventiveness (nonobviousness), utility (industrial a pplicability) and sufficient description.11 As noted by a commentator: Analytically, this proposition exemplifies the familiar Aristot elian 7 Shamnad Basheer & T. Prashant Reddy, 'The Efficacy of Indian Creases in Section 3(d)', 5(2) SCRIPTed 232 (2008), 244. 8 See generally 'Holger Hestermeyer, Human Rights and the WTO: The case of Patents and Access to Medicines', 14(6) Int.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 3 3dichotomy between essence/kind on the one hand, and attributes/quality on the other, also reflected in other intell ectual property laws. Thus, in copyright law, what qualifies as an art istic work (its 'essence' or 'kind') is analytically distinct from th e question whether the work is 'original' or not (its 'attribute' or 'qual ity').12 'inherent patentabil ity' denotes limitations in terms of the kind of 'subject matter' that would qualify for pa tent protection- this question is different from and often precedes the question of w hether the said subject matter meets the ' patentability' criteria. In most member countries, the principle of patent eligibility i s embodied in the term 'invention' i.e. a poem, though new and useful, cannot be paten ted, since it is not an 'invention'.13 This is true with TRIPS as well, with Article 27.1 drawing a s harp distinction between patent eligibility and patentability, by it s use of the term 'invention'. It reads as below: In this chapter, we focus on the \"patent eligibility\" criteria that countries deploy in order to limit the scope of patents considered deleterious from the point of view of public health. Broadly, such exclusions include the following: i) Ordre public or morality14 ii) Method of Medical Treatment15 iii) Plant and Animal Varieties16 iv) Discoveries17 v) Second Medical use18 vi) Combinations with no synergy19 vii) Derivatives of chemical sub stances with no \"efficacy20\" Patent eligibility exclusions can be broadly divided into three broad classes: i) Exclusions that are based on \"policy\" considerations 12 David Vaver, 'Invention in Patent Law: A Review and a Modest Proposal', 11 (3) Intl J Law and IT 287(2003). However, he cautions in a footnote that 'the distinc tion between kind and quality cannot be pressed too far. For example, one might fairly argue that novel ty and nonobviousness are part of an invention's essence'.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 5 5II. METHODS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT A. Introduction Methods of medical treatment are excluded from patentability in a large number of countries today. The most commonly cited justification is that such patents are likely to fetter the freedom of physicians and prevent them fro m helping patients with the latest medical advances. To this extent, this exceptio n best captures the tension between patent law and it s innovation inducing rational e on the one hand, and concerns of public health on the other, where doctors must be free to administer the latest medical techniques without fear of patent infringeme nt or incurring costs of licensing such inventions. As a commentator rightly notes: \"Patenting of methods of medical treatment of human beings is, however, a complicated issue for it is not only based on patent law but also on medical law. Medical law has its origins in the Hippocratic Oath, and the goal is the preservation of human life. Since the goal of patent law is to encourage innovation by rewarding inventors, it is quite distinct from the goal of medical law. Thus, there is a public policy concern that in order to ensure the best possible health treatment, physicians must always be free in their choice of treatment.\"22 The articulation of these competing concerns can also be found in various judicial pronouncements. Illustrative ly, Justice Jacob notes in Bristol\u00adMyers Squibb Co v Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals Inc that 'The purpose of the limitation is... merely to keep p a t e n t l a w f r o m i n t e r f e r i n g d i r e c t l y w i t h w h a t t h e d o c t o r a c t u a l l y d o e s t o t h e patient.'23 W h i l e s o m e W T O m e m b e r s t a t e s h a d i n i t i a l l y i n t e r p r e t e d e x i s t i n g patentability criteria to oust new medical methods,24 they later began to base such exclusions on stand alone ethical and public policy grounds. In other words, methods of medical treatment began to be seen more as a patent eligibility criteri on stemming from p u b l i c p o l i c y c o n c e r n s r a t h e r t h a n a p a t e n t a b i l i t y o r a n i n h e r e nt patentability criterion.25 It is pertinent to note that this historical development gives us reason to suspect that patentability crite ria such as \"utility\" may take on the role of patent eligibility criteria in some cases.26 Europe is a good example in this regard.

(Last visited on August 11, 2010) SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 6 6Convention (EPC) categorically excludes ''methods of medical tr eatment\" on the ground that such methods are not ''susceptible of industrial ap plication\".27 G i v e n t h a t m e d i c i n e i s p r a c t i c e d f o r t h e m o s t p a r t w i t h i n a \" c o mmercial\" and perhaps \"industrial\" framework in a large number of countries, some scholars have questioned the logic of such a rationale. 28 However, others have maintained that there continues to be a distinction between the practice of a n oble \"profession\" such as medicine and an \"industry\".29 For instance, Chris Wadlow categorically argues that historically the medical profession has never been regarde d as trade or an industrial activity.30 He provides the following justifications: \"...One of the distinguishing features of an organized professio n is that its members are subject themselves to a higher code of practice and honour than mere tradesmen, exemplified in the case of medical practitioner s by the so called Hippocratic oath... The proposition that medicine cannot s imultaneously b e a p r o f e s s i o n a n d a n i n d u s t r y i s c o n s i s t e n t w i t h t h e t r e a t m e n t of patentability of methods of diagnosis, surgery and therapy...

However, countries such as Japan, Morocco and South A frican continue to exclude medical methods on the ground that such methods are not c a p a b l e o f industrial application.33 27 The EPC was signed in Munich in 1973 and came into effect in 1978.

H o w e v e r , p r i o r t o t h e E P C , U K c o u r t s b a s e d t h e i r m e t h od of medical treatment exclusion on what some commentators perceive to be an untenable legal foundation .34 UK courts and the patent office rejected medical method patents on the ground that they were not \"vendible\" products35 and therefore did not constitute a \"manner of manufacture\".36 However, with the liquidation of the vendibility criterion fro m the p a t e n t a b i l i t y l e x i c o n , t h e m e t h o d o f m e d i c a l t r e a t m e n t e x c l u s i o n could not be sustained on this ground anymore.37 Courts therefore began to link up the exclusion to a want of \"artificiality\" or a lack of an essential economic character as required for an invention under the NRDC case 38 Later however, courts began to look for ways in which to tether this exclusion explicitly to \"ethics\" than any of the traditional patentability criteria. However, they shied away from explicitl y articulating such an exclusion, preferring instead to leave the job to the legislatu re.39 In Eli Lilly & Co's Application40 the patents appeal tribunal noted that the exclusion is ''technically anomalous and therefore illogical'' and appears t o \"be based in ethics rather than logic\". However, it also noted that \"if there is to be a change of policy, which would appear to us to be sensible, this ought in our view to be effected by legislation rather than by interpretation\".41 T w o y e a r s l a t e r , t h e l e g i s l a t u r e d i d i n d i c a t e i t s e n d o r s e m e n t o f t h i s e x c l u s i o n , a l b e i t o n t h e g r o u n d that it lacked \"industrial application\".42 The Australian position tracked the UK position for the large p art, with both countries influencing each other in their determination of the patentability of this controversial subject matter. At first, Australian courts rejec ted such methods as nonvendible products. 43 However, with NRDC 44 the objection gradually morphed supra n. 27. 34 Justine Pila, supra n. 25. 35 Re G.E.C.'s Application , (1942) 60 RPC 1. 36 Schering Case, [1971] R.P.C. 337. 37 Anna Feros, 'Patentability of Methods of treatment', 23(2) EI PR 79 (2001) 80. 38 William van Caenegem, 'The Technicality Requirement, Patent S cope and Patentable Subject Matter in Australia' 13 Australia n Intellectual Property Journa l 41(2002), 478.

See also Upjohn Company (Robert's) Application [I977] 1 RPC 94, where Russell J said that it was well established that a method of treatment of a human ailm ent with a known substance was not capable of being an invention under the Statute, and that if th is should be changed, it should be done by Parliament. 42 See Section 4(2) Patents Act 1977 (UK)) as per which \"an invention of a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body shall not be taken to be capable of industrial application .\" However, the Patents Act has been amended in 2004 and Section 4A does not mention industrial appl ication. 43 A n n a F e r o s , supra n. 25; The requirement that the re be a ''manner of manufacture '' in the Statute SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 8 8into one of \"economics\" and \"artificiality\". Courts appeared to suggest that methods of treatment were \"essentially non economic\" in nature45 and that they lacked the \"artificiality\" required of an invention.46 Later, courts began to explicitly reject methods of treatment as generally \"inconvenient\" inventions und er the statute of monopolies.47 However, this was later reversed, with courts suggesting that there was no rational basis for holding such methods to be \"generally inconvenient\". 48 In so far as the other European countries are concerned, almost all of them excluded medical methods on one ground or the other, till the time of th e EPC and its intended harmonization of the laws of mem ber countries. However, even af ter this harmonization drive and conseque nt pressures on individual EC m ember states to conform, the alleged rationale for exclusion appears slightly d ifferent in the different countries. Illustratively, while The United Kingdom, Germany, a nd France 49 appear to mirror the EPC in stating that methods as not industrially a pplicable, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden treat such methods as noninventions, and Swi tzerland treats them as legal exceptions to patenting.50 Germany might have been the only exception in this regard where , in the early 1 9 0 0 s , t h e G e r m a n P a t e n t O f f i c e g r a n t e d a f e w p a t e n t s f o r m e d i c al methods51. However, in 1904, the German Patent Office suggested that such patents could not be granted, since the statute did not envisage patent protectio n for the treatment of humans.52 More specifically, this and other future cases appeared to sug gest that an industrially applicable invention could only be assumed to exis t if raw material was mechanically or chemica lly treated or processed.53 of Monopolies has been described as ''the touchstone of patenta bility'' and still is in force today in Australia, New Zealand, and Isra el (Patents Act 1990 (Cth),3 S 18 and schedule 1). 44 National Research Development Corp. v.

Contrast this with Switzerland an d Austria which refused such patents on ethical grounds.

See also O SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 9 9 By 1990s, more than 80 countries, in Europe, Asia, Africa, Nort h America, South America and Central America, exe mpted medical methods from pate nt protection.54 The principal rationale for excluding medical methods in most c ountries appears to be one of \"ethics\", namely that doctors must be free to use the l a t e s t m e d i c a l methods to help patients. The exclusion also appears to be base d in some countries on the notion that the medical profession cannot qualify as \"in dustry\" and therefore does not come within the proper scope of patentable subject mat ter.55 Skeptics question these justifications by arguing that if the r ationale is to help doctors use the latest medical technology in favour of patients , there is no reason why pharmaceutical drugs that are used in the course of treatme nt ought to be p a t e n t a b l e . I n o t h e r w o r d s , s i n c e s u c h d r u g s a r e p a t e n t a b l e a n d h o s p i t a l s a n d patients routinely pay the patented price, they must do so with patented medical methods as well. This dilemma can be better understood if one c onsidered the Bristol Meyer case in Australia, which involved the new use of a known substance to treat cancer.56 The substance itself might have been patented initially and doc tors m i g h t h a v e p a i d t h e m o n o p o l y p r i c e t o c u r e p a t i e n t s w i t h t h i s d rug. With the discovery of a new use of the said drug, should a patent be dis allowed only to permit doctors and patients to use it without payment of royalties. Al though such new use claims are captured by the patentee as \"method\" claims, is this not as good as patenting a new drug. Why then should doctors and patients be f ree to use this new use of the drug without paying any royalties?57 On the other hand, some argue that there is a significant disti nction between a 'drug' and 'a method of medical treatme nt' administered to a patient. Drug development and its introduction into the market is a long and expensive jo urney which necessitates incentives in the form of patents.58 In comparison, most medical methods are relatively inexpensive to discover and implement.59 In this regard, it is pertinent to note the novel approach of t he US, which is to permit such patents, but to prevent their enforcement by doctors and r elated healthcare professionals.60 If the key issue is seen as one of freedom of doctors to deploy latest medical techniques to help patients, this approach might appear to be a more direct way of resolving the issue.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 10 10concerned, the concern is more in terms of affordable medicines and accessible healthcare.61 The report by the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights n otes the importance of affordable healthc are particularly for developing countries: \"...IP rights are not conferred to deliver profits to industry ex cept so that these can be used to deliver better healthcare in the long term. Suc h rights must therefore be closely monitored to ensure that they do actually promote healthcare objectives and, above all, are not responsible for p reventing poor people in developing countries from obtaining healthcare.\"62 Indeed, a number of developing countries continue to stress the need for affordable availability of treatment methods both in their domestic IP for mulation63 and at various international policy making fora.64 Recently, India protested against the s e i z u r e o f g e n e r i c d r u g s e x p o r t e d b y I n d i a n p h a r m a c e u t i c a l c o m p anies to destinations abroad via the EU ports. India argued before the T RIPS Council that the widespread and repeated seizures, under the EC Regulation 1383, have an adverse systemic impact on the principle of universal access to medicin es, national public health budgets, legitimate trade of generic medicines and also seriously impair the efforts of civil society organisations engaged in providing med icines and improving public health in the least developed parts of the world.65 To this extent, the conflict between the standard patent ration ale of incentivizing innovation on the one hand and that of fostering a more optimal public health outcome on the other is a starker one in the context of develop ing countries.66 Further, given that many developing countries are net importers of technology, the importance of the incentivizing innovation rationale diminishes somewhat when compared with the access to medicines and affordable healthcare imperative. Having said this, it is important to appreciate that developing countries are not one monolithic block. Rather, the emergence of technologically prof icient developing countries suggest that such countries might balance out the com peting innovation and public health policies in wa ys that are different from othe r developing countries, 61 T i n a P i p e r , supra n. 5. 62 Commission on Intellec tual Property Rights, Integrating Intellectual Property Rights and Development Policy, London, 2002, 35, available at http://www.iprcommission.org/pap ers/pdfs/final_report/CIPRfullf inal.pdf.

The legislative history indicates that this provisio n was introduced to prevent the phenomenon of 'evergreening' a nd thereby addressing the issue of affordability of medicines.

TRIPS and other Multilateral Treaties Article 27.3(a) of the TRIPS agreement68 excludes methods for the treatment of humans or animals from patentability. However, it makes clear t hat products or processes that are deployed during the course of medical treatm ent are patentable in their own right, since they d o not amount to \"methods of tre atment\" ipso facto.69 As early as 1964, during the preliminary stages of the plan to introduce a European patent for the Common Market, the European Economic Community ( EEC)'s working group on patents resolved to recognize the principle of the free exercise of the medical profession by means of a restriction on patentabili ty. 70 This resulted in a proposal to exclude methods for treatment performed on the huma n or animal body from patentability. The proposal was later expanded to include methods of diagnosis, and in its final word ing referred to 'methods for tr eatment ... and d i a g n o s t i c m e t h o d s . ' I n t h i s f o r m , i t w a s p r e s e n t e d t o t h e L u x e mbourg Inter Governmental Conference to establish a European System for the Grant of Patents.71 At this conference, in line with earlier proposals, a patent ba n was instated that explicitly referred to human a s well as veterinary medicine.72 The Munich Diplomati c Conference, 197373 a t w h i c h t h e E u r o p e a n P a t e n t convention was signed, advised against including methods for me dical treatment as \"noninventions\", as they are \"inventions\" but merely lacked in dustrial applicability.74 Thus came in the Article 52(4) of the 1973 EPC, which stipulat ed that surgical or therapeutic methods of treating the human or animal body and diagnostic methods carried out on the human or animal body are not industrially applicable inventions within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC. Today, a number of multinational treaties permit signatories to exclude methods of medical treatment from patentability. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Article 1709(3)(a) allows its members to exclude from p atentability \" d i a g n o s t i c , t h e r a p e u t i c a n d s u r g i c a l m e t h o d s f o r t h e t r e a t m e n t o f h u m a n s o r animals.\"75 67 S h a m n a d B a s h e e r a n d A n n a l i s a P r i m i , Implementing Wipo's Development Agenda, Jeremy DeBeer, ed., Wilfred Laurier Univ ersity Press, 2009, available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1289288.

Europe The European Patent Convention (EPC) categorically excludes \"me thods of medical and veterinary treatment\" from patentability.80 Such inventions are excluded to ensure that people who carry out medical or veterinary treatmen ts are not inhibited by patents. As noted earlier, prior to the EPC 2000, methods of medical and veterinary treatment were excluded on the basis that they were not capable o f i n d u s t r i a l application. Under the EPC 2000, however, this problematic deem ing provision was done away with. Methods of treatment are now excluded directly, and presumably on the basis of ethical concerns with such patents.81 Article 53(c) EPC 2000 provides that 'a patent shall not be granted for methods of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body'. Most EU member states have implemented this provi sion within their domestic regimes.82 76 The African Intellectual Prope rty Organization (OAPI) was for med by the adoption of a new convention signed in Bangui on 2nd March 1977.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 13 13Given that the substance of the exclusion remains the same (pre and post EPC 2000), the only difference being one of rationale/justification, case law interpreting the exclusion under EPC 1973 is still applicable.83 In fact, the Enlarged Board of Appeal categorically mentioned that even after EPC 2000, the 'actual l egal position remains unchanged'.84 1.

Surgery, therapy, or diagnosis For an invention to be excluded by Article 53(c), it must consi st of a method of surgery, therapy, or diagnosis. In order to make this determina tion, tribunals had earlier focused on the skill and knowledge needed for a person to use the method in question. Thus, if an activity were to be carried out by or und er the supervision of a doctor or a vet, exercising medical or veterinary skills, it wa s more likely to fall within the exclusion.86 I f t h e i n v e n t i o n c o u l d b e u s e d b y s o m e o n e s u c h a s a n engineer or a farmer with little or no medical expertise, it wa s more likely to fall outside the scope of the exclusion. However, after the Enlarged Board of Appeal decision in Diagnostic methods87, this approach is no longer relevant. The Board categorically held th at the question of whether or not an invention falls within the exclusion is not d ependent on who carries out the method in question. In its words: 'whether or not a method is a diagnostic method within the meaning of [EPC 1973 Article 52(4); EPC 2000 Art 53(c)] should neither depend on the participation of a medical or veterinary practitioner, by being present or by bearing the responsibility, nor on the fact that all method steps can also, or only, be practiced by medicinal or non\u00admedicinal support staff, the patient himself or herself or an automated system.' Although these comments were made in relation to diagnostic met hods, it is likely that the reasoning could also be applied to surgery and therapy .88 Therefore, the only criterion now is that the \"method\" itself must qualify as surgery, therapy, or 83 We've borrowed most of the Euro pean analysis from Brad Sherma n's excellent reference material that he sent as part of Phase I of this project.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 14 14diagnosis, and one does need to determine as to who the \"perfor mer\" of the said method is. However, the skill and knowledge needed to perform a n invention may provide a useful indication.89 i) Surgery: 'Surgery' has been defined as t he branch 'of medicine concerne d with the healing of disease, accidental injury or bodily defects by oper ating on the living body'. It is said to include both 'conservative (noninvasive) procedures (such as vaginal hysterectomy, laser surg ery to shrink tumors, dermatolo gical procedures, Lasik eye surge ry ) and the ar m ore num erous o per ative (inv asi v e) procedures using instruments'. In recent years, there appears to have evolved two approaches, albeit inconsistent ones, to the way that surgery is defined. While one approach is to focus on the nature of the physical intervention, the other is to concentrate on th e purpose o f t h e intervention. Under the first and oldest approach, tribunals ha v e l o o k e d a t t h e nature of the intervention and asked if this would qualify as ' surgery'. This approach is endorsed by the EPO Guidelines which state that surgery is d efined by 'the nature of the treatment rather than the purpose'.90 It as also been applied in a series of decisions by the Technical Board of Appeal at the EPO.91 It is also the approach that has been adopted in the UK.92 Lately, the EPO has moved beyond the nature of the intervention and focused on the purpose of the invention in question i.e. whether the physical interve ntion 'is suitable for maintaining or restoring health, the physical inte grity of the physical well being of a person or animal'.93 The Enlarged Board of Appeal held (albeit in 89 Wellcome/Pigs I, T116/85 [1988] EPOR 1. 90 Medi\u00adPhysics, G1/07 of 15 February 2010 provided guidelines on the exception to patentability on methods for treatment of the body by surgery. The context of this decision relates to methods for MRI imaging of lung and heart vasculature. It has been question ed whether the presence of a single surgical step in a multistep me thod excludes the surgical step f r o m p a t e nt ab i li t y . T h e p r e s e n t decision makes it clear that a method is excluded from patentab ility if it involves at least one method step for treatment of a body by surgery or therapy. The decisio n emphasizes that it is the nature of the intervention that is decisive in defining surgery, and not the purpose. When determining its nature, a guiding factor may be the complexity of the invasive step, including the required medical expertise and the health risks involved. 91 Shell/Blood flow, T182/90 [1994] EPOR 320, 323 (the presence of a surgical step in a multistep method for treatment of the human or animal body normally confe rs a surgical character on that method); See also Baxter International Inc., T329/94 (1998) OJEPO 2 41 (foc used on the use of surgical instruments). 92 Occidental Petroleum's Application BL O/35/84 (A method of embryo implantation which required the intervention of a surgeon or veterinary surgeon wa s held to be a surgical method, regardless of its purpose). See also Allen's Application BL O/59/92 (It is wrong to assume that a method which did not necessarily require a surgeon could not be considered to be surgery. A physical intervention which requires the medical skills of, for example, a nurse, could still be regarded as surgery. Thus the nature of the method and performer are import ant in determining whether the method is a surgery). 93 BrainLAB AG, T0542/06 decided on 10.10.2007, available at http://legal.eur opeanpatent . (Last visited on July 05, 20 10) [A method for visualizing procedural guidelines for a medical procedure in which a medica l instrument is shown in an image representation of a body portion including the area in which a medical procedure is to be carried out is patentable and does not fall under the exception. The method for visualizing procedural guidelines SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 15 15obiter) that surgery 'includes any physical intervention on the human or animal body in which maintaining the life and health of the subject is of paramount importance'.94 On the basis of the above proposition, tribunals have held that processes whose end r e s u l t i s t h e d e a t h o f l i v i n g b e i n g s u n d e r t r e a t m e n t , e i t h e r d e liberately or incidentally, fall outside th e ambit of the exception.95 In a similar vein, in the General Hospital decision96, the Technical Board of Appeal held that surgical treatment is that which aims at curing. On t his basis, it was held that methods which were 'neither clearly suitable nor potential ly suitable for maintaining or restoring the health, the physical integrity, or the physical well being of human beings or animals' fell outside the exclusion in Artic le 53(c) EPC 2000. The above framework has led to the exclusion of a number of \"co smetic\" surgeries from the scope of Article 53. Illustratively, the Board conclud ed that an application that related to 'methods for hairremoval using optical radiati on' (effectively applying optical radiation to a selected wavelength to damage t he hairs and follicles without causing significant damage to the skin) was not exclude d from patentability. While the invention involved 'a nonintentional physical interv ention which [was] to be regarded as a surgical operation', it was not 'potentially s uitable for maintaining or restoring the health, physical integrity, or physical wellb eing of a person or animal'. The purpose of the application was to improve the aest hetic appearance of the person treated rather than to cure the underlying malady. A s such the Board held that the application did no t fall within the remit of Arti cle 53(c).97 Applying a similar logic, the Board also said that tattooing an d piercing, whose only possible object was to beautify the human or animal body, would not fall foul of EPC 2000 Art 53(c). However, the tribunals drew a distinction betwe en cosmetic surgeries that were only intended to beautify and those that in tended to restore bodily integrity.98 T h e r e f o r e , m e t h o d s r e l a t i n g t o b r e a s t e n l a r g e m e n t o r n o s e reconstructions which were meant to restore the physical integr ity of the body following, for example, breast cancer or a car accident were he l d t o b e n o n patentable.99 T h e n a t u r e o f t h e c o n f l i c t b e t w e e n t h e t w o l i n e s o f d e c i s i o n s a t the EPO was recognized by the Technical Board of Appeal in Medi\u00adPhysics,100 where the question does not have a surgical character because it is not suitable o r potentially suitable for maintaining or restoring the health, the physical integrity, or the physical w ellbeing of a human being or animal, or to prevent diseases]. 94 Diagnostic methods, G01/04 (2006) OJEPO 334 (EBA). 95 Georgetown University/Pericardial access, T35/99 (2000) OJEPO 447, 451. 96 General Hospital removal method T 383/03 (2005) OJEOPO 159. 97 Ibid. 98 S e e a l s o Thermage , T1172/03 decided on 04.05.2005 [The application of electromag netic energy through the skin surface of the body to a collagencontaining t issue site, in order to achieve controlled contraction of collagen and skin tightening.

In so doing, the Technical Board raised the fami liar complaint of purposebound tests, namely that the same physical activity may be used for different purposes. Thus the injection of a medicament (such as Botox) for treating a disease would be excluded, whereas the injection of the same me dicament for the purpose of reducing wrinkles would not (on the basis that it wo uld be carried out for cosmetic rather that curative reasons). In this context, the op eration of the exclusion will depend on the motive of the person administering the drug. However, when the decision was referred to the Enlarged Board for consideration, it held that it was important to focus on the nature of the activity itself, rather than on the type of person who delivers the activity and what their motive may have been.101 In the abovementioned case of Medi\u00adPhysics, the applicant, Medi Physics Inc, filed an application relating to medical imaging of the heart or lungs w hich involved injecting or inhaling Xenon 129. The Examining Division rejecte d the application on the basis that the injection of the Xenon 129 amounted to a sur gical step and that the invention concerned a diagnostic method. On appeal the Technica l Board of Appeal held that the invention was not a diagnostic method, but on the subject of injecting the Xenon 129, it referred the c ase to the Enlarged Board. The Enlarged Board had to answer the question: \" Is a claimed imaging method for a diagnostic purpose which comprises or encompasses a step consisting of a physical intervention practised on the human or animal body, to be excluded from patent protection as 'a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery' pursuant to article 53(c) EPC if such a step does not per se aim at maintaining life and health?\" T h e E B A c o n c l u d e d t h a t t h e c l a i m e d i m a g i n g m e t h o d w a s e x c l u d e d from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC 2000 due to the fact that t h e i n v a s i v e (injection) step was required, irrespective of whether the purp ose was diagnostic or not. The Board clearly stated that the purpose of the method is irrelevant - the exclusion is not limited to therapeutic or reconstructive surgery. Instead, surg ery is defined by the nature of the method, and in particular the leve l of skill required and risk incurred, not the ultimat e purpose of the procedure. (ii) Therapy : 'Therapy' has been interpreted broadly as the curing of a dis ease or the correction of a malfunction of the human or animal body. 102 It also includes prophylactic treatments with a view to maintaining health by pr eventing ill effects that would otherwise arise.103. On the basis that pregnancy and lice infestation are not \"diseases\", inventions for m ethods of treatment that preven ted pregnancies and removed lice were not caught by the exclusion.104 However, a method of immunizing against coccidiosis105 and a method of controlling mange in pigs106 were held to 101 Kononklijke Philips Electronics T09/04 (Unpublished); See also Maquet Critical Care T1102/02 (Unpublished). 102 Michigan State University , T0866/01 decided on 11.05.2005 [Application of a medicament ' for providing euthanasia in lower mammals' cannot be considered a t herapeutic method]. 103 I, 1. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 17 17relate to diseases and, as such, were excluded as methods of tr eatment by therapy. The exclusion of therapeutic methods applies irrespective of wh ether the disease or bodily malfunction that the inve ntion seeks to prevent or cure is internal or external, and whether or not it is a temporary or a permanent infliction. It also applies irrespective of the origin of the pain, discomfort or incapacit y that the therapy seeks to remedy.107 While an invention may interact with or relate to a human or a nimal body, it will only be excluded if it is classified as a form of treatment on the body. In line with this, the Technical Board of Appeal held108 that 'a method and apparatus for preventing piglets from suffocating' by blowing hot air und er a mother pig to discourage piglets from going un der her was patentable. While t he invention protected the body, it was still patentable because the method was not treating any malfunction the body of the pigl et and hence could not be class ified as therapy. Here again, \"cosmetic\" methods are excluded. In other words, w hile a method that leads to weight loss for the purpose of curing or preventing ob esity would not be patentable, a method for weight loss that is undertaken for cos metic purposes does not fall within the scope of the exclusion.109 However, if a method was to have both potential uses (weight loss for obesity and for cosmetic purpos es) and the claim in the patent merely recites the intent, the said method is not ex cluded from the ambit of the exception. If the cosmetic use of the method is only ex pressed in the claim as a m e r e i n t e n t i o n o f t h e p e r s o n u s i n g t h e m e t h o d . T h u s , t h e m e t h od of skin resurfacing, being both surgical (requiring application of elec tromagnetic energy through the skin surface) and therapeutic (i.e. application on the face or neck for r e c o n s t r u c t i v e p u r p o s e s ) i s e x c l u d e d f r o m p a t e n t . T h e c o s m e t i c use of these methods is only expressed in the claim as a mere intention of the applicant , a feature which is only reflected in the mind of the person carrying out the claimed invention. This is a subjective, nontechnical feature which is not releva nt for the assessment of patentability.110 (iii) Diagnostic Methods: The nature and scope of the exclusion of diagnostic methods was clarified to a large extent by the decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal in Diagnostic methods.111 I n t h i s d e c i s i o n , t h e E n l a r g e d B o a r d h e l d t h a t methods of diagnosis typically consist of four subsidiary steps . These are: (1) Examination: involving the collection of data (recording th e case history), (2) Comparison: comparing this data with normal values, (3) Identification: identifying any significant deviation from the norm (i.e. symptom), and (4) Diagnosis: the 'deductive me dical or veterinary decision ph ase' where the 107 Rorer/Dysmenorrhea , T81/84 (1988) OJEPO OJEPO 301 (A cosmetic method is patentable unless it inevitably has a therapeutic effect. It was therefore possible to patent a method of dieting involving suppression of appetite, since the effect would not n ecessarily have been positive). 110 Thermage , supra n. 98. See also Mobil Oil III, 1990 OJEPO 93. 111 Diagnostic Methods, G01/04 (2006) OJEPO 334. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 18 18diagnosis for curative purposes is made (which represents a pur ely intellectual or nontechnical exercise). A key issue that the Enlarged Board was forced to contend with was whether to fall within the exclusion an application only needed to include the fourth 'deductive stage' (broad interpretation), or whether it had to include all four stages (narrow interpretation). Drawing on a range of factors, the Enlarged Bo ard adopted the broad interpretation and said tha t to fall within the exclusion , all four steps needed to be present in an invention. (In so doing the Enlarged Board overturned the Technical Board's decision of Cygnus112 and reinstated the earlier decision of Bruker/Non \u00adinvasive measurement113). The Board also said that no distinction should be drawn between the essential method steps that have a diagnos tic character and nonessential steps that do not.114 Under the Boards framework, a distinction is now drawn between the act of making a diagnosis (which involves the interpretation of data to reach a conclusion) and methods of data acquisition or data processing (the results of which may s u b s e q u e n t l y b e u s e d i n d i a g n o s i s ) . I f a n i n v e n t i o n o n l y p r o v i d e s i n t e r i m o r preliminary results (data or information), the invention will n ot be excluded from patent protection by Article 53(c). Put differently, the exclus ion will only apply where an invention makes it immediately possible to decide on a particular course of medical treatment ( i . e . t h e c u r a t i v e s t e p r e p r e s e n t i n g t h e d e d u c t i v e m e d i c a l decision phase).115 As a result, a method of taking a sample or determining intern al temperature or pH would not in itself identify a condition and as such would not be classified as diagnostic method.116 The current interpretation of Article 53 means that many diagno stic methods will no longer be caught by the exclusion, despite the express language of the EPC 2000. It also means that common diagnostic procedures practised on the h uman body, such as percussion or palpitation, could, in principle, be patented because they do not constitute a complete \"diagnosis \". The reasoning of the Enlarge d Board has been 112 Cygnus/Device and method for sampling substances , T964/99 [2002] OJEPO 4, 13. The invention, which monitored sugar levels from the skin thus avoiding the ne ed for the pricking of fingers to collect blood, did not involve all the steps in medical diagnos is (it only provided information used to make a diagnosis). The Board rejected Bruker and held that the patent was a method of medical diagnosis and as such was excluded from patentability. Drawing upon the French text of the EPC, the Board in Cygnus s aid t h at t he EP C 'd o es no t f av o u r an int er p r et at io n l im it i ng the exception to patentability encompassing all steps required for reaching a me dical diagnosis. Instead the Board said that 'any medical activity concerning the gathering of inf ormation in the course of establishing a diagnosis qualifies as a diagnostic method.' 113 Bruker/Non \u00adinvasive measurement T385/86 [1988] EPOR 357, \u00b6 (for an invention to be classified as a nonpatentable diagnostic method, all of the different steps had to present). 114 Diagnostic methods G01/04 (2006) OJEPO 334, 356 (EBA). 115 Exergen Corporation , decided on 23.10.2008 [A radiation detector for tymp hanic temperature measurement i.e. ear temperature detector only defi nes the data acquisition steps (the temperature of the body) which can be used in a diagnostic meth od.

On the basis that the invention only led to the acquisition of data, it was held that the invention w as not a diagnostic method as d efined in Article 53(c) EPC 2000. Commentators have critiqued what they perceive to be a whittlin g down of the method of treatment exception, by defining terms such as diagno sis in a very limited way: \"As the discussion of European case law demonstrates, the legal definition of diagnostic methods does not reflect the true nature of a medical diagnosis. Modern diagnoses are rarely final and few occur without the aid of data and quantitative results from laboratory testing\".118 Treatment on or in the body\u00ad The \"method of treatment\" exclusion articulated in Article 53 only applies to methods that are practised on or i n the human or animal body i.e. the exclusion does not apply to methods practised on substances that are removed from the body. Illustratively, the treatment of blood f or storage in a blood bank or diagnostic testing of blood samples is not excluded. Si milarly, operations that occur at a cellular level (such as the incorporation of an oncogene into the fertilized egg of an animal) are not performed on or in the bod y.119 In contrast, a treatment of blood by dialysis, where the blood is returned to the same body, would be excluded from patentability.120 In Aerocrine AB,121 the European Board of Appeal determined the patentability of a method for ascertaining the current lung function of a human su bject. The method comprised of measuring the endogenous nitrogen monoxide content and/or the time of its distribution during one or more exhalation phases i n a sample of exhaled air. Since measuring is of a technical nature, it had to be eva luated whether or not it is practiced on the human body. The Board categorically stated that: \"It results from the feature 'measuring... during one or more exhalation phases' that the presence of the human subject and its connection to the device is necessary even if the measuring was to be performed on exhaled air removed from the body. The condition 'practised on the human body' is therefore satisfied in the present situation\". As stated earlier, diagnostic methods typically consist of a nu mber of steps, all of which must be present if an application is to fall within the a mbit of the exclusion. While this framework is essential to determining whether someth ing amounts to a diagnostic method and is therefore excluded, the converse appea rs to apply when determining if a diagnostic method is practised on or in the hu man or animal body. 117 Medi\u00adPhysics/Treatment by Surgery T992/03 (2007) OJEPO 557, 563. 118 T i n a P i p e r , supra n. 5. 119 Harvard/Onco \u00admouse (2003) OJEPO 473, 491 (OD). It clarified that 'the incorporati on of the oncogene into the genome is a method which is neither surgical nor therapeutic nor diagnostic in nature'. 120 EPO Guidelines, CIV, 4.8. See Baxter/Blood extraction method, T329/94 [1998] EPOR 121 Aerocrine AB, T0125/02 decided on 23.05.2006. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 20 20The reason for this is that some of the stages in a diagnostic method (particularly the final 'deductive phase') are intellectual exercises: they are c arried out in the mind of the medical or veterinary practitioner. To get around the prob lems that this might pose, the Enlarged Board of Appeal held that the requirement th at the invention be 'practised on or in the human or animal body' is only to be con sidered in relation to method steps of a technical nature. 'Thus, it does not apply t o the diagnosis for curative purposes stricto sensu, i.e. the deductive decision phase, which as a purely intellectual exercise cannot be practiced on the human or anima l body'.122 Direct treatment \u00ad I n o r d e r f o r a p a t e n t t o f a l l w i t h i n t h e t h e r a p e u t i c m e t h o d exclusion, it is necessary to show that the invention constitut es a direct treatment by therapy. This means, for example, that while the programming of a pace maker to control the way it uses energy undoubtedly has an indirect effe ct on the human body, it was held to be more concerned with improving an appara tus, rather than health.123 While it is difficult to draw the line between direct and indi rect effects, a patent is more likely to fall within the exclusion if it can be shown that there is a 'corresponding functional link' between the invention and human or animal health. That is, a method does not fall within Article 53(c) 'if there is no functional link and hence no physical causality between its constituent steps carri ed out in relation to a therapy device and the therapeutic effect produced on that body by that device'.124 Similarly, it has been held that to fall within the exclusion, the invention must target a p arti cula r illness o r disease, and also pr o vide a 'de fined, r eal treatment' of a pathological condition.125 Two or more uses\u00ad So long as an application has a use which falls within the scop e of Article 53(c) it will be excluded. This is the case even if the invention has other uses that do not fall within the exclusion . Thus, an application for a method of cleaning plaque from human teeth which had both an (excluded) t herapeutic effect and a (nonexcluded) cosmetic effect was excluded from patentab ility by Article 53(c) EPC 2000 on the basis that the application claimed a ther apeutic treatment.126 While the presence of a surgical step in a multistep method of the treatment of the human or animal body normally confers a surgical character on t he method, there may be some cases where this is not the case.127 On the basis that methods that have a destructive purpose do not fall within the aim of section 4A/ Article 53(c) surgery is limited to processes that give 'priority to maintaining life or health of the human or animal body on which they are performed'.128 As such, a process that has as its end result the death of a living thing (either deliberately or incidentally) will not be caught by the exclusion: even if the process involves a surgica l step. Similarly, the fact that a chemical product has both a cosmetic and a therapeu tic effect when used 122 Diagnostic methods, G01/04 (2006) OJEPO 334. 123 Ela Medical, T789/96 (2002) OJEPO 364, 369. 124 Siemens, T245/87 125 Lilly/Serotonin receptor, T241/95 (2001) OJEPO 103, 109. 126 ICI/Cleaning T35/99 [2000] OJEPO 447, 451. This is in contrast to processes whose end result is the death of living things 'under treatment' either deliberately or incidentally.

Limits\u00ad While Article 53(c) imposes important limits on the types of me dical and veterinary inventions that may be patented, it would be wrong t o assume that all medical and veterinary inventions are excluded from the scope o f patent protection. The reason for this is that the potential scope of the exclusio n is restricted by the fact that it must be read in light of Article 54(5).130 These provisions have been construed in such a way that they pe rmit the patenting of uses of known substances for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a particular disease. However, these socalled Swiss claim patents are beyond the scope of this exception. 131 The Enlarged Board of Appeal decision in KOS life sciences132 further clarified the q u e s t i o n , w h e r e i t i s a l r e a d y k n o w n t o u s e a p a r t i c u l a r m e d i c a m ent to treat a p a r t i c u l a r i l l n e s s , w h e t h e r t h i s k n o w n m e d i c a m e n t c a n b e p a t e n t ed under the provisions of Articles 53(c) and 54(5) EPC 2000 for use in a di fferent, new and inventive treatment by therapy of the same illness. In other wo rds, is it possible to patent the same medicament for the same illness, used in a diff erent way? Replying in the negative the EBA has recently held in G02/08 133 that second medical use claims in the Swisstype format are no longer allowable before the EPO. Thus, it is not allowed to patent the same medicament for the same illness, used in a different way. A s A r t i c l e 5 4 ( 5 ) o n l y a p p l i e s t o m e d i c a l m e t h o d s w h i c h u s e s u b s tances or compositions, the exclusion of methods of medical and veterinar y treatment still applies where apparatuses and objects are used. However, Swiss type claims aiming a t t h e u s e o f s u r g i c a l i n s t r u m e n t s w e r e r e j e c t e d b y t h e T e c h n i c al Boards. The residual scope of the exclusion was reaffirmed by the Appeal Bo ard of the EPO when i t r e s i s t e d a t t e m p t s t o e x t e n d t h e s c o p e o f A r t i c l e 5 4 ( 5 ) b e y o n d the use of substances and compositions to i nclude the surgical use of an i nstrument. 134 129 General Hospital Corp/Hair removal method T 383/03 (2005) OJEPO 159, 162. 130 Article 54(5) states that 'the p rovisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not exclude the patentability of any substance or composition, comprised in the state of the art , for use in a method referred to in Article 52, paragraph 4, provided that its use for any metho d referred to in that paragraph is not comprised in the state of the art.' 131 I n Eisai, G0005/83, the EPO accepted that Art 54(5) by relaxing the usu al novelty rules enables the inventor of a first medical use to obtain purposelimited p roduct protection for a known substance or composition. But for second and subsequent medical uses it held that Art 54(5) no longer applies. The prior identification of any medical use is enough to invoke the proviso. 132 KOS Life Sciences/Dosage Regimen, T1319/04 (2009) OJEPO 36. 133 KOS Life Sciences\u00b8G02/08 of February 19, 2010. 134 CODMAN/Second surgical use, T 227/91 (1994) OJEPO 491 held that second medical use claims to surgical instruments were not allowed on the grounds that ' a surgical use of an instrument is not analogous to a therapeutic use... since the former is not consumed in the application and could be repeatedly used for the same or even for other purposes' . SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 22 22United Kingdom : Historically, the UK excluded methods of treatment from the sco pe of patentability on the ground that such methods were not \"vendible products\"135 and therefore did not amount to a \"manner of manufacture\". In C & W's Application136 a method of extracting lead from human bodies was held ineligible for paten t protection because of its lack of association with the manufacture or sale of a 'c ommercial product'. Later development was seen in the form of the NRDC case137 f r o m A u s t r a l i a , involving a method of using a kn own chemical substance to help remove weeds from crop areas without affecting the crops themselves. The court ef fectively repudiated the \"vendibility\" test and noted that in order to be patentable , the claimed invention must: 138 i) provide a material advantage ii) be of value within an economic field of endeavor. iii) must belong to practical rather than the fine arts iv) must possess as its end result an artificial effect or a discer nible artificial state of affairs. Based on the above, the court held that the claimed method of e radicating weeds was patentable since it consisted of an artificially created st ate of affairs discernible by observing the growth of weeds and crops sown on the land, an d it is of tremendous economic value.139 Drawing on the NRDC principles outlined above, commentators sug gest that methods of treatment of the human body would be excluded on the grounds of their \" e s s e n t i a l l y n o n e c o n o m i c \" n a t u r e a n d t h e f a c t t h e y l a c k e d t h e \"artificiality\" required of inventions.140 In line with the above decision, UK courts and the patent offic e began to base their exclusion of medical methods on the fact that such claims lacke d the \"artificiality\" required of inventions. 141 This reason was first articulated in Swift & Company's Application142 in respect of a method of treating live animals, and was adapted during the 196 0s to support the exclusion in relation to humans as well.143 Thus in Neva Corporation's Application144 135 Re G.E.C.'s Application , (1942) 60 RPC 1 136 C & W's Application , (1914) 31 RPC 235. 137 NRDC (1959) 102 CLR 252. 138 Ibid, 275. 139 A.L.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 23 23a method of inducing a state of reduced awareness in humans (an d animals) by means of sounds generated by a known apparatus was held to be a n unpatentable method of medical treatment on the ground that its utility depe nded upon the reception and interaction of the sounds with the human brain, t herefore lacking any \"artificiality\" of invention.145 Pursuant to the advent of the EPC 1973 and the EPC 1990, the UK amended its law to be in consonance with these multilateral instruments. And UK courts have, for the most part, rendered decisions that are largely in conformity wi th the EU courts understanding of the method of medical treatment exclusion. Illustratively, the approach adopted by the Enlarged Board in Diagnostic methods has been followed by the UK Intellectual Property Office. The E nlarged Board in the decision noted that the criterion \"practised on the human body\" w a s t o b e considered only in respect of me thod steps of a technical natur e. It also pointed out that steps involved in diagnosis such as comparison of data wer e nontechnical in character as they are performed outside the body146. A method performed on the body which does not enable a disease to be identified, but whic h may be of value in diagnosis (i.e. only for acquisition of data) is therefore not excluded under Section 4A(1) of the 1977 Act in UK since the amendment in 2004 adopts the EPC position. For example, a method of imaging using CT scanning147, a method of measuring blood glucose148 a n d a m e t h o d o f a s s e s s i n g t i s s u e v i a b i l i t y b y m e a s u r i n g t o t a l haemoglobin, oxygen saturation and hydration149 were all considered to provide only intermediate results which did not enable a diagnosis to b e made. Indeed, UK courts have also stressed on limiting the reach of t his exclusion on the basis of its alleged rationale. In Bristol\u00adMyers Squibb Co v Baker Norton Inc, Jacob J held:150 \"[T]he limited purpose of the [s 4(2)] exception ... is not so broad as to allow doctors using whatever they feel they need to treat patients. If that w ere the purpose then one would not allow patents for medicines or medical implements a t a l l . T h e purpose of the limitation is much narrower, merely to keep patent law from interfering directly with what the doctor actually does to the patient. Patent monopolies are permitted to control what he administers to, or the implements he uses on, the patient. The thinking behind the exception is not particularly rational: if one accepts that a patent monopoly is a fair price to pay for t he extra research 144 Neva Corporation's Application , [1968] RPC 481. 145 This with London Rubber Industries Ltd's Patent, [1968] RPC 31 where a method of controlling female ovulation through the prescribed oral adm inistration of known hormones was refused a patent on the ground, implicitly, that the utility of such method depended upon the physiological response of the person treated and for this reaso n fell outside the realm of useful arts in which inventions exist. 146 E d d y D .

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 24 24incentive, then there is no reason to suppose that that would n ot apply also to methods of treatment\" (emphasis added).151 However, there are some minor differences between the interpret ations proferred by the EU and the UK courts. Illustratively, as the UK Intellec tual Property Office Guidelines for medical inventions note, the approach as outline d in the General Hospital decision that methods which were 'neither clearly suitable nor potentially suitable for maintaining or restoring the health, the physical integrity, or the physical well being of human beings or animals' fell outside th e exclusion in Article 53(c) EPC 2000, is outofstep with British practice. Following the 1983 UK decision of Unilever (Davis' Application) which in obiter mentioned that claims to a method of surgery should be refused, regardless of their purpose, the UK Intellectual Property Office has decided not to fo llow the EPO in this regard. 152 D. North American Region: United States In the United States, patents on medical procedures were not al lowed until 1954. The earliest case in this regard was Morton v. New York Eye Infirmary153, in which a patent for a procedure of administering ether to surgical patie nts as an anaesthetic was disallowed on grounds of lack of novelty and obviousness. A lthough this case seemed to have been decided on traditional patentability criter ion, it was perceived as establishing more generally that medical procedures were unp atentable subject matter.154 In Ex parte Brinkerhoff155, Morton was relied upon by the Patent Office Board of Appeals which went on to hold that 'methods or modes o f treatment of physicians of certain diseases are not patentable' on the ratio nale that 'to grant a patent for a particular method of treatment would have a tenden cy to deceive the public by leading it to believe that the method therein describ ed and claimed would produce the desired result in all cases'.156 However, in Ex parte Scherer157, while allowing a patent on a method of injecting medicine by a pressure jet, the Board overruled its decision in Brinkerhoff and held t h a t m e d i c a l o r s u r g i c a l p r o c e s s e s o r m e t h o d s w e r e p a t e n t a b l e s ince they constituted a 'useful process' under \u00a7 101 of the United States Code.158 151 The Enlarged Board of the EPO reiterates a similar philosophy noting that the exclusion \"helps to achieve the socioethical and public health goal that 'medical and veterinary practitioners should be free to take the actions they consider suited to diagnose illne ss by means of investigative methods'.\" See Diagnostic methods G01/04 (2006) OJEPO 334. 152 Unilever (Davis' Application) [1983] RPC 219: ' .....surgery can be curative of the disease or diseased conditions, or prophylactic, that is, preventative of diseased conditions, as for example, where an appendix or tonsils may be removed before any diseased condition starts up, and surgery may even be cosmetic without being curative or preventative. Any method of surgical treatment, whether it is curative, prophylactic or cosmetic, is not patentable.' 153 17 F. Cas. 879 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1862). 154 Cynthia M. Ho, supra n. 5, 611. 155 24 Off. Gaz.

Given that almost half of all cataract procedures perf ormed in the United States involved Dr. Pallin's technique, several associations of physician's protested the enforcement of this patent and lobbied for legislative chan ge in this regard.160 Responding to this uproar created by Dr Pallin's patent, the US government brought in a specific defense in favour of medical practitioners using patented methods through the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act.161 A s a r e s u l t o f t h i s a c t , Section 287(c)(1) now provides that: \"With respect to a medical practitioner's performance of a medi cal activity that constitutes an infringement unde r section 271(a) or (b) of this title, the provisions of section 281, 283, 284, and 285 of this title shall not apply ag ainst the medical practitioner or against a related health care entity with respe ct to such medical activity.162 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(c)(2)(A) however provides for an exception from the above rule by stipulating that the defense wil l not apply to a patented machi ne, item of manufacture, or composition of m atter, biotechnological patents , and importantly, patented uses of a composition of matter..163In short, although the US grants patents to medical methods, they curtail the scope of such patents by p roviding an express defences in favour of medical practitioners that use such metho ds.164 To this extent, the treatment of medical method patents by the US is perhaps un ique. Canada\u00ad There is no specific statutory bar to the patenting of medical methods in Canada. The issue has been left largely to the courts, which ha ve held that methods 159 \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, mac hine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any ne w and useful improvement thereo f, may obtain a patent therefore, subject to the conditions and re quirements of this title\".

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 26 26of medical treatment are considered inherently unpatentable.165 To be considered a method of medical treatment, the method should cure, prevent or ameliorate an ailment or pathological condition, or treat a physical abnormal ity or deformity such as by physiotherapy or surgery.166 As with other common law jurisdictions, Canadian courts have al so confirmed that while methods of using surgical instruments are inherently unpa tentable,167, the instruments/apparatuses designed to perform surgeries are thems elves patentable.168 In Tennessee Eastman Co. v. Commissioner of Patents169, the leading case on the point, the Canadian Supreme Court was faced with the patentability of an alleged invention relating to \"a new use for esters of acyanoacrylic acid and mo re particularly to a s u r g i c a l m e t h o d o f j o i n i n g t i s s u e s u r f a c e s t h r o u g h t h e u s e o f s uch esters as adhesives\". This claim had been rejected by the patent examiner on the ground that i t w a s d i r e c t e d t o w a r d s a m e t h o d o f s u r g i c a l t r e a t m e n t . W h i l e u pholding the decision of the patent office, Justice Kerr relied extensively on the NRDC decision.170 And held in pertinent part that the claimed invention did not f all within the field of the manual or productive arts nor did it, when applied to the h uman body, produce a result in relation to trade, commerce or industry or a result t hat was \"essentially economic\". The method related essentially to the professional f ield of surgery and medical treatment of the human b ody, even although it could be applied, at times, by persons not within that field. In so far as methods of diagnosis are concerned, courts have he ld that methods of testing not relating to any step of actual treatment or vital f unction of the body, have been held to be patentable.171 This appears similar to the EU position, where the meaning of \"diagnosis\" has been considerable narrowed to permit wider patenting of such methods. Courts have held that prophylactic methods of treatment are unp atentable,172 as are methods for reducing nicotine cravings, and cleaning teeth.173 To this extent, Canadian courts appear to take a different line than the EU aut horities by holding 165 Tennessee Eastman Co. v.

Methods that involve the excision of tissue, organ, or tumour samples from the body are considered to be forms of surgery, and are excluded regardless of their reproducibility. The removal of fluids from the body such as by needle or cannula is not of itself surgery.175 Mexico Article 19 (VII)176 of the Industrial Property Law in Mexico states that methods of surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic treatment applic able to the human body and to animals shall not be considered as \"inventions\". Th us such methods are not patentable under the Mexican Law. E.

Since methods of me dical treatment were not vendible products, they could not be patented.179 In the NRDC Case,180 the court shifted the analysis away from a pure \"vendible product\" test to a more general manner of manufacture test; ask ing if the process or product is \"... a proper subject of the letters patent according to the principles which have been developed for the application of Section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies.\" 181 The court noted that in order to clear the requirements of the test under the NRDC Case, the subject matter must be useful, provide a material adv antage, and be of 174 C h a p t e r 1 2 , Manual of Patent Office Practice (MPOP), available at http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernetinternetopic.nsf/eng/ wr02212.html .

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 28 28value within the economic field of endeavor.182 The court also noted in passing the \"apparent\" need to exclude methods of treatment of the human bo dy on the grounds of their \"essentially noneconomic\" nature.183 Subsequently, in Joos v. Commissioner of Patents184, t h e H i g h C o u r t o f A u s t r a l i a narrowed the scope of the exclusion of methods of treatment of the human body by confining the exclusion to methods of preventing or alleviating diseases, malfunctions or incapacities.185 The invention in question in this case was a 'process for improving the strength and elasticity of keratinous materia l'. The Court held that mere application of a substance to the human body did not quali fy as 'treatment'. Explaining this concept further, it was held by Barwick, C.J.: \"To be treatment in the relevant sense, it seems to me that the purpose of the application to the body whether of a substance o r a process must be the arrest or cure of a disease or diseased con dition or the correction of some malfunction or amelioration of some incapacity or disability.\" 186 On this basis, the court drew a distinction between cosmetic pr ocesses and therapeutic processes, noting that a cosmetic process of streng thening hair and nails had no relation to a method of treatment of a disease, malfunct ion, disability or incapacity of the human body and the cosmetic process for impro ving the strength and elasticity of human hair and nails was patentable subject m atter.187 The court a l s o c o n c l u d e d t h a t t h e m e d i c a l f i e l d w a s a s e c o n o m i c a s a n y o t her, implicitly r ej e c t i ng t he v e n d i b l e p r o d u c t t e s t o r t h e \" e s s e n t i a l l y e c o n o m i c nature\" test as controlling.188 However, it did not fully clarify whether or not patents for m edical methods involving surgery etc could continue to be excluded on the ground that it was \"generally inconvenient\".189 This position was clarified in Anaesthetic Supplies Pty Ltd v Rescare Ltd,190 where the court held that a method of medical treatment could not be cons idered as generally inconvenient. It noted that although Parliament had the opportu nity to exclude methods of treating the human body when it enacted the 1990 Act , it chose not to do so.191 Rather, it merely excluded human beings and biological process es to generate human beings from the scope of patentability.192 It must be borne in mind that the EU explicitly legislated to exclude medical methods from patent ability in 1973 and the UK followed suit in 1977. 182 Ibid, 275. 183 Ibid. 184 Joos v.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 29 29The Anaesthetic Supplies position was endorsed in Bristol\u00adMyers Squibb Co v F H Faulding & Co Ltd193, where the Federal Court of Australia dealt with patents claiming a method of administering Paciltaxel (a naturally occurring co mpound from the Pacific Yew Tree) for the treatment of cancer. While the Court upheld the invalidity of the Patent on grounds of lacking novelty, it nevertheless co ncluded that methods of medical treatment were patentable subject matter .194 The Court held that it was difficult to justify the distinction between patentability of a product for treating the human body and a method of treatment.195 It further held that the legislative history in Australia favoured the grant of patents for methods of medic al treatment.196 Although the ruling of the Court in both Anaesthetic Supplies and Bristol\u00adMyers may be considered obiter dicta according to some commentators, it is still widely considered as the law of the land now.197 Australia is therefore one of the few countries that grants pat ents over medical methods. It tracks the US position in this regard, except that while the US recognizes an express defense that saves doctors and others who use patent ed medical methods, Australia does not. New Zealand\u00ad The Patent Act of 1953 in New Z ealand does not contain any sta tutory exclusion from patentability of medical methods like those prev alent in Canada and Australia.198 Further the Courts in New Zealand have historically conformed with English decisions and held that a method of treatment of human illness or disease does not qualify for the grant of a patent, since it does not m eet the requirement of 'manner of manufacture' under the definition of 'invention' in Section 2.199 In the Wellcome case, an application for a new method of treating meningeal leukemia in the brain by using known compounds was refused by t he Assistant Commissioner of Patents as not coming within the scope of an in vention under Section 2 of the Patents Act 1953.200 This was reversed by the Supreme Court, which held that there was no basis in law or otherwise for excluding medical methods.201 In his decision, CJ Daviso n elaborated as follows: 193 [2000] FCA 316 (22nd March, 2000). 194 Todd M.

I think not. The Court m u s t n o w t a k e a r e a l i s t i c v i e w o f t h i s m a t t e r i n l i g h t o f c u r r e nt scientific developments. The law must meet the need of the age.\"202 This decision was in turn reversed by the New Zealand Court of Appeals which categorically held that a patent may not be granted for a metho d of treating a disease or illness in humans. 203 The basis for the decision appears to be that English Courts have held under legislation similar to that in New Zealand that a m e t h o d o f treatment of a human being is not patentable. Further according to Somers J. there was no New Zealand or Australian case that has held the contrar y.204 The Court of Appeals stated that a shift in the law which favours grant of a monopoly for such medical methods was the prer ogative of the Parliament. 205 In 1999, the Court of Appeals in the PHARMAC case 206 found that a method of medical treatment fell within the definition of the term \"inven tion,\" but such claims may be properly prohibited on policy or ethical grounds. The Co urt suggested that to p e r m i t c l a i m s t o e x t e n d t o t h e m e t h o d o f t r e a t m e n t u s i n g t h e c o mpound or composition would require the patentee to submit a disclaimer o f any right to sue the practitioner in order to ensure that there is no interferen ce with the medical practitioner's diagnosis and treatment of patients. In a subsequent case of Pfizer Inc v. Commissioner of Patents207, Pfizer submitted such a disclaimer to the Court and argued that this was consistent with the PHARMAC case. However, the Court c a t e g o r i c a l l y s t a t e d t h a t t h e o b s e r v a t i o n i n t h e PHARMAC case w i t h r e g a r d t o submission of a disclaimer was directed to the Legislature and officials considering reform proposals and was not an indication to impose such a req uirement in future cases.208 F o l l o w i n g t h e d e c i s i o n i n Bristol\u00adMyers Squibb Co. v Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals Inc.209, the Court has held that claims drafted in the Swiss format may be rejected if they also relate to the mode of administrati on, dosage or frequency of dosage. The medical treatment exclusion has been recently challenged by Pfizer Inc. before the Court of Appeal.210 Pfizer Inc's applications related to methods of medical treatment of psychotic disorders using a new compound. The appe llants argued that the amendments to the Patents Act of 1953 introduced in 1994 fo r the purposes of implementation of the TRIPS Agr eement intentionally omitted the m e d i c a l treatment exclusion.211 T h e y a l s o r e l i e d o n p r o p o s a l s f o r r e f o r m s i n o t h e r 202 Wellcome Foundation v.

The Court of Appeal unequivocally held that the medical treatment exclusion was still the governing law and that its omission fro m the amendments implementing the TRIPS Agreement did not indicate an intention by the Parliament that the medical exclusion no longer applied. As far as the arg ument relating to reforms was concerned, the Court held that any change in policy in this regard was a matter for the legislature and not for the courts. F.

Part II of the Examination Guideline s for Patent and Utility Model under Section 2.1 of the Act lays down that a method of m edical treatment is not industrially applicable.213 The term medical treatment includes surgery, therapy and diagnostic methods.214 M e t h o d s f o r t r e a t m e n t o f s a m p l e s t h a t h a v e b e e n removed from the human body and methods of gathering informatio n from them are not considered methods of treatment and are therefore not exclu ded from patentability. On the other hand, if the sample is returned to the human body, it is a medical method and is therefore excluded from patentability.215 Methods for treatment of the human body by surgery include surg ical operations and drawing blood (for tissue culture, dialysis etc), cosmetic methods for surgical operations whose purpose is not therapeutic or diagnostic (for plastic surgery, cosmetic makeover etc) and preparatory treatment for surgery, such as anesthetic treatment. These methods are ind ustrially inapplicable and ther efore not patentable. Methods for treating the human body by therapy include the foll owing: (i) methods of giving or injecting medicine, or giving physical treatment t o a patient for cure or restraint of a disease; (ii) methods of implanting substitute o rgans such as artificial internal organs or artificial li mbs; (iii) methods of preventin g a disease 216and methods of treatment for the maintenance of physical health and (iv) Preparatory m e t h o d s o f t r e a t m e n t b y t h e r a p y o r m e t h o d s f o r n u r s i n g a s s o c i a t ed with the exclusions from patentability. For instance, Section 17(1) as i t stood originally empowered the Commissioner to decline registration if it appeared to him that the invention in respect of which the patent application was made would be \"contrary to law or morali ty\". The provision was amended in 1994 so that it now applies only where the use of the invention in respect of which the application is made would be \"contrary to moral ity\".

It is to be noted that metho ds per se for measuring structures or functions of the human body whose purpo ses are other than medical ones such as detecting diseases or recognizing or judging the physical condition of the human body are not deemed as \"methods for trea tment of the human body by diagnostic methods.\" India\u00ad Section 3 of India's Patent Act, 1970 lists out all non patenta ble subject matter. Section 3(i) excludes from patentability \"any process for the medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic or other treatment of human beings or any process for a similar treatment of animals or plants to render them free of disease or to increase their economic value or that of their products\" . This provision rules out the patentability of methods used for the treatment of not only human beings, but also animals and plants. The word \"treat ment\" is quite broad and includes \"medicinal\", \"surgical\", \"prophylactic\", \"curative \" o r a n y \" o t h e r treatment\". This exclusion is therefore of broad scope. Till da te, it has not been interpreted by Indian courts. However, the Indian patent office has interpreted it on various occasions as outlined below. In Benitec Australia Ltd.'s patent application218 the claim was relating to a method of repressing, delaying or otherwise reducing the expression o f a t a r g e t g e n e i n a vertebrate cell by introducing one or more dispersed nucleic ac id molecules. The Patent Examiner in this case held that \"...for Section 3(i) to ap ply, all three criteria listed therein must be present a nd satisfied. Thus, what is inv olved must be: (a) Any process for the medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic [ diagnos tic therapeutic] or other treatment; (b) The process or the treatment should be directed to either live human being or live animals; and (c) The process or the treatment should such as to render either th e human beings or animals free of disease or possessed of increased eco nomic value for themselves or their products. 217 Examination guidelines for patents and utility models in Japan\u00adPart II\u00adChapter 2. 218 Patent Application No. IN/PCT/2000/00169/DEL decided on 31.03 .2010. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 33 33Even if one of the criteria were absent, Section 3(i) cannot ap ply.\"219 It was held that the claimed invention did not satisfy any of t he above mentioned criteria and was therefore not e xcluded under Section 3(i) of t he Act. In Lalit Mahajan's patent application,220 the issue was whether 'a device for detection of antibodies to HIV and p24 antigen of HIV in human serum or plasma' was excluded und er Section 3(i). T he oppo nen ts arg u ed tha t th e Applicant had camouflaged the diagnostic aspect of the device. The Patent Exa miner observed that the invention in question was a device and not a diagnostic or therapeutic process/method. As a result, the ground raised by the opponent was not sustainable and Section 3(i) was found to be inapplicable. This view was co nsistent with a previous decision finding the ex clusion inapplicable in case of a device for the rapid detection of presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against dengue viral antigens in a sample (human serum) for a diagnostic purpose.221 Applicants have attempted to bypass the exclusion by drafting their claims in the forms of products or kits camouflaging the essence of the inven tion. In Christoph Von Mandach's patent application222, the claimed invention was a method for the correct application of orthodontic fastening parts such as buttons, hoo ks, eyelets or brackets onto teeth. Subsequently, after objections in the First Examina tion Report, the claims were amended and worded as 'a kit comprising an orthodontic fas tening part, a protector, and an applicator' with descriptions of each of the components. It was held that the description mainly referred to the method for the correct application of orthodontic fastening parts and was therefore not an invention under section 3(i). Similarly, in M/s. Applied Research Systems Ars Holding, Netherland 's patent application223 the issue was whether the claim relating to a 'kit for the tre atment of infertility in women comprising multiple doses of FSH ...' could be excluded under Section 3(i). The Patent Examiner concluded that the said inven tion was merely a method of medical treatment in the guise of the claimed kit (a product), and was not patentable under Section 3(i). In some cases applicants have even attempted to overcome the pa tent eligibility threshold under Section 3(i) by elaborately drafting the claim as one dealing with a p r o c e s s f o r p r e p a r i n g p h a r m a c e u t i c a l c o m p o s i t i o n s , a l a S w i s s c l aim style. In Tissuegene Inc.'s patent application the claim was 'a method of preparing a pharmaceutical composition which has an ability to generate or regenerate bone at a bone defect site comprising: a. insertion of a gene encoding a protein belonging to TGFB (Tra nsforming Growth FactorB) super family having bone regeneration function i n t o a vector operatively linked to a promoter, and b. transfecting or transducing a population of mammalian fibrobla sts, 219 Ibid, 2. 220 Patent Application No. 693/KOL/2007 decided on 11.01.2010. 221 Patent Application No. 2484/DEL/2007 decided on 24.07.2009. 222 Patent Application No. 2003/CHENP/2004 decided on 23.04.2010. 223 Patent Application No. 404/MUMNP/2005 decided on 28.09.2007. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 34 34chondrocytes or bone progenitor cells in vitro with said recomb inant vector of step a.\" It was held that what was being claimed as a method of preparin g a pharmaceutical composition was only a method of treating the connective tissue of a patient in vitro and producing modified connective tissue for reintroducing it into the patient body for generation of bone in vivo. The claim was amended to delibe rately restrict the subject matter to a method for obtaining modified connective ti ssue as a method of preparing pharmaceutical composition described in step (a) and (b), which was an attempt to disguise the content of the invention which in reali ty was a method of treatment. However, in a matter dealing with the enhancement of therapeuti c efficacy, the patent office has held that claims such as improvement of insol ubility reducing toxicity and improving of crossing blood brain barrier are not as such excluded under Section 3(i).224 The Examiner accepted the argument of the Applicants who submitted that enhancement of therapeutic qualities did not amo unt to a method of treatment. There is considerable debate as to whether the invitro methods of diagnosis are covered within the ambit of the exclusion under Section 3(i). I n M/s Becton Dickinson and Company's patent application225, the Applicants filed for a patent application titled as 'Diagnosis of Sepsis or Sirs using Biomak er profiles' which was amended during prosecution of the application as an 'Invitro me thod of determining the status of sepsis using biomarker profiles.' The Examiner of Patents and Designs recommended that certain claims are not allowable under the pro visions of Section 3 ( i ) o f t h e P a t e n t s A c t . T h e c l a i m s w e r e a m e n d e d b u t t h e E x a m i n er raised an objection against the first 31 claims. Claims 325 being produc t claims which were novel, inventive and industrially applicable were allowed. Duri ng the hearing, the agent for the Applicants argued that the patent manual provides that methods of diagnosis performed on tissues or fluids which have been perman ently removed from the body are not excluded under Section 3(i) of the Patent s Act. As per the manual, 'Body' should be taken to mean living body. The agent f or the Applicant argued that while the status of sepsis in an individual is a 'd iagnostic method', such diagnosis is taking place outside the body i.e. by an invitro method which as per the guidelines issued by the Patent Office is not excluded by Secti on 3(i) of the Act. The Examiner however concluded from the plain reading of the cl aims and the express admission by the agent fo r the Applicant that the alleg ed invention is a diagnostic method. It was also held that Section 3(i) of the Pa tents Act prohibits any diagnostic method irrespective of whether it is invitro or invi vo. It was clarified that the patent manual refers to a diagnostic method performed on ti ssues or fluids which have been permanently removed from the body. As far as th e present invention was concerned, the samples collected are for the diag nosis of a living 224 M/s Signature R&D Holdings LLC's Patent Application , Patent Application No. 942/DELNP/2006 decided on 1.05.2009. 225 Patent Application No. 1200/CHENP/2005 decided on 17.07.2007. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 35 35individual and not for the identification of a substance from t he permanently removed tissue or fluid. Hence, t he subject matter was disallow ed under Section 3(i). Similarly, the argument that the test is conducted invitro and hence is patent eligible was rejected in M/s. University of Reading's patent application .226 T h e c l a i m , a method relating to identifying t he possible occurrence of 'Pre eclampsia' in pregnant ladies by determining the level of neurokinin B was held to be a diagnostic method. However, it must be noted that in Benitec Australia Ltd.'s patent application, one of the reasons for inapplicability of Section 3(i) was the fact th at the cell subjected to treatment had been removed from the vertebrate. This might perh aps suggest that the distinction between invitro and invivo forms of treatment i s discarded only in cases dealing with diagnostic methods. The phrase 'other treatment' in Section 3(i) has also generated c o n t r o v e r s y regarding inclusion of cosmetic intervention. In M/s. Galderma Research and Development S.N.C.'s patent application227 the claim involved was \"a method of improving the appearance of the body or hair, which comprises t he application to the body or hair of a cosmetic agent comprising a compound as d efined in the claims\". The Examiner held that the above claim fell within Sec tion 3(i) as it involved treatment of skin using the cosmetic agent.228 Allied questions dealing with whether lifestyle disorders can b e considered as a 'disease' are equally pertinent to an enquiry under this provis ion. In a patent application dealing with 'a method of discovering compounds sui table for the treatment and or prohylaxsis of obesity...', the Patent Examine r concluded that it is a method of diagnosis and treatmen t and hence not patentable unde r Section 3(i).229 Based on all the above, it would appear that the Indian Patent Office interprets the method of medical treatment exclusion in a wider manner than th e EPO and UK patent office/courts, consequently excluding a larger number of such inventions from patentability. China\u00ad Chapter II of the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China deals with the requirements for the grant of a patent. It states that, in orde r to be patentable, an invention must possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiv eness and usefulness or practical applicability. Article 25 of the same chapter prov ides the list of subjects excluded from patentability. Clause (3)230 states that no patent right shall be granted for a method of diagnosis or for the treatment of diseases. Thu s Chinese patent law provides a broad ban on patentability of such methods. 226 Patent Application No. IN/PCT/ 2002/593/DEL decided on 31.3.20 10. 227 Patent Application No. 2196/DELNP/2003 decided on 31.03.2010. 228 It is interesting to note that the High Court of Australia in Joos v. Commissioner of Patents, [1973] RPC 59 has allowed patent claims relating to a process for impr oving the strength and elasticity of human hair and finger nails. The rationale being that purely co smetic processes are not covered by the exclusion dealing with processes relating to treatment of h umans or animals. 229 Patent Application No. 195/MUMNP/2003 decided on 18.05.2006. 230 Article 25 (China): For any of the following, no patent right shall be granted:...

Clause (b) of Article 7231 provides that a patent shall not be granted to an i n v e n t i o n o f a m e t h o d o f e x a m i n a t i o n , t r e a t m e n t , m e d i c a l c a r e , and/or surgery which may be applied on human beings and/or animals. This provi sion therefore, expressly excludes a patent bein g granted in respect of such me thods. Malaysia \u00ad Part IV of the Malaysian Patents Act, 1983 deals with patentab ility of inventions. It provides that an invention must possess the basi c requirements of patentability i.e. novelty, inventive step and industrial appli cation. Section 13 provides a list of nonpatentable inventions; Clause (d)232 of this section provides that methods for the treatment of human or animal body by surge ry or therapy, and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body are no t patentable. However, the proviso to this clause states that this exclusion from patent shall not apply to any products used in such methods. Therefore, this Act expressly excludes such methods from patents but ex pressly includes the products u sed therein. Pakistan \u00ad Chapter III of the Patents Ordinance 2000 of Pakistan lays dow n patentability criteria. Article 7 states that any invention is patentable in Pakistan if it new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial ap plication. Article 7(4) provides a list of non patentable inventions; Clause (c)233 of this Article states that a patent shall not be granted for diagnostic, therapeutic and sur gical methods for the treatment of humans or animals. Therefore, such methods are exp ressly excluded from patents in Pakistan. Philippines \u00ad The Philippines has a very exhaustive Intellectual Property Cod e. Part II of this Code deals with patents. Chapter II of this Part pro vides that any technical solution of a problem which is new, involves an inventive step and is industrially a p p l i c a b l e s h a l l b e p a t e n t a b l e . S e c t i o n 2 2 w h i c h f a l l s u n d e r t h e same chapter provides a list of nonpatentable inventions. Clause 22.3234 expressly excludes from patents methods for treatment of the human or animal body by su rgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body. H owever, the same clause also states that this provision shall not apply to produ cts and composition for use in any of these methods. 231 Article 7 (Indonesia): P at e nt s hal l n o t b e gr a nt ed t o an inv e nt io n o f: ... . .

T his provision shall not apply to products and composition for use in any of these methods. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 37 37South Korea\u00ad The Patents Act of South Korea does not expressly exclude metho ds of treatment from patentability. Thailand \u00ad Chapter II of the Patent Act of Thailand deals with patents for inventions. Part I of the chapter spells out patentability criteria i.e. no velty, nonobviousness, inventive step and capability for industrial application. Secti on 9 of the chapter provides a list of non patentable subject matter; Clause (4) of the section states that a patent shall not be granted for methods of diagnosis, treatme nt or cure of human and animal diseases. Methods of treatment or cure would include s u r g i c a l , therapeutic and diagnostic methods. G. South America South American legal systems are best understood when divided i nto three zones: the Mercosur area, the Andean Pact area, and jurisdictions not aligned to any of these. Mercosur does not have a common IP regimen, and however somewhat interconnected, the legal systems remain national. The Andean p act influences the basic IP legal system of countries under the Pact (Bolivia, Col ombia, Ecuador, and Peru). Ancillary domestic provisions may be added as supplement ary law. However, Andean law prevails over such domestic law. Thus, countries may provide enhanced protection under their domestic laws, but the minimum standards are laid by the Andean supranational law. Also, any domestic law in violation o f Andean law is invalid. Laws regarding countries in each of these three regions are dis cussed hereunder. COUNTRIES IN THE MERCOSUR AREA Brazil\u00ad Article 10 of Brazilian patent law 235 provides a list of items which shall not be considered inventions or utility models, and are therefore n onpatentable. Clause VIII of this article provides that techniques and methods for o perations or surgery or methods for therapy or diagnosis applied to human or animal bod y are not considered inventions and are therefore nonpatentable. Argentina \u00ad I n A r g e n t i n a , A r t i c l e 4 o f t h e P a t e n t L a w 2 4 . 4 8 1 s t i p u l a t e s t h at all i n v e n t i o n s t h a t a r e n e w , i n v e n t i v e a n d s u b j e c t t o i n d u s t r i a l a p plication are patentable. Article 6 lists out non patentable subject matter; clause (e) of this Article236 provides that surgery treatment, therapeutic or diagnosis meth ods, applicable to the human body and regarding animals are not cons idered inventions and therefore cannot be patented. 235 Article 10 (Brazil): The following shall not be considered inventions or utility mod els:.... VIII techniques and methods for operations or surgery or methods for therapy or diagnosis applied to human or animal body. 236 ARTICULO 6 (Argentina) : No y los relativos a animals. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 38 38Paraguay \u00ad Paraguay Patent law (1.630/00) g rants patents to all new, inven tive and useful inventions. Under Article 4237 of this law, certain items are not considered inventions; clause (e) of this Article states that diagnosis, t herapeutic and surgery (for people and animal treatment s) is not invention, hence not patentable. Uruguay \u00ad Uruguay Patent Law provides that new products and procedures th at imply an inventive activity and are subject to industrial appli cation are patentable.238 Article 14 of the Law239 which provides a list of items that are deemed not patentable inventions includes \"diagnosis, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of persons or animals\". COUNTRIES OUTSIDE MERCOSUR: ANDEAN REGION As stated earlier, countries in this region have adopted the Co mmon Intellectual Property Regime. As per Article 14 of this Common Regime,240 goods and process patents shall be granted for inventions that are new, involve a n inventive step and are industrially applicable. Article 20 provides a list of inve ntions that shall not be patentable. Clause (d) of the article241 states that inventions in respect of diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods for the treatment of humans o r animals are excluded from patents. Therefore, it is to be noted here, that the Common IP Regime of the Andean expressly excludes such methods from being patent ed, and not from the definition of invention itself. Therefore, this specific ex clusion follows the TRIPs Article 27 standards, not the al so Mercosur trend of deeming it not an invention. T h e s p e c i f i c d o m e s t i c l a w s o f e a c h o f t h e c o u n t r i e s i n t h e A n d e an Region are discussed hereunder: Ecuador\u00ad Patent Law of Ecuador provides t hat all inventions satisfying n ovelty, technical and industrial utility shall be patentable. However, certain inventions stated under Article 126 of the Law242 are expressly excluded from patents. Clause 237 Ley 1.630/00 (Paraguay): Art \u00edc u1 o 4\u00b0.

(b) Los m\u00e9todos de SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 39 39(b) states that the methods of diagnostic, therapeutic and surg ical treatment of humans and animals are not patentable. Even though being invent ions satisfying the general patentability requiremen ts, patents are denied to inven tions in these areas. Bolivia\u00ad Bolivia Industrial Property Law of 1916 provides the same crite ria for p a t e n t i n g a s u n d e r t h e C o m m o n R e g i m e . B o l i v i a n d o m e s t i c l a w r e m ains supplementary and subject to the Andean rules. There are no pro visions under Bolivian domestic law pertaining to specific exclusions regardi ng diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for treatment of humans and an imals. Therefore, it follows the Common Regime of the Andean Region. Peru\u00ad Peru is also essentially ruled by the Andean rules. It also has its domestic law of 2009 as edited by the Free Trade Agreement with the United S tates. The new legal environment in respect of methods of surgery, therapy and diagn osis for treatment of humans and animals does not d iverge from the Andean text. Colombia \u00ad Colombia applies the Andean Commo n Intellectual Property Regime .

It is considered that such methods are not susceptible of industrial application and therefore do not fulfill the fundame ntal requirements of patentability. Chile\u00ad The Chilean IP statute was amended in 2006 in order to assimila te new international obligations. Artic l e 3 2 s t a t e s t h a t p a t e n t s a r e o btainable for all inventions that are new, non obvious and capable of industrial application. Chilean law excludes diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for t reatment of humans and animals from the definition of invention, and not from pate ntability. Article 37 of the Law states that surgical, diagnostic and therapeutic met hods for human or animal body are not considered inventions, discoveries or abstr act knowledge, thus not patentable. However, products intended to implement these m ethods are diagn\u00f3stico, SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 40 40H. Africa and Middle East Region Most African and Middle East countries exclude methods of treat ment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, as well as diagnostic met hods. However, Nigeria is an exception and does not exclude methods of treatment of t he human or animal body by surgery or therap y, as well as diagnostic method s. Regional Treaty: The African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI) was formed by the adoption of a new convention signed in Bangui on 2nd Mar ch 1977. The OAPI consists of sixteen west and Central African countries, namely; Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Patent law under the OAPI is dealt with under the Bangui Accord.243 Article 6(e) of the Bangui Agreement prohibits patents to be granted for methods for the t reatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, including diagnosti c methods.244 Bahrain Article 3(A)(3) of Bahrain's patent law prohibits the grant o f patents for diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods necessary for the treatment of humans and animals. The provisions also clearly states that it shall n ot apply to products used in any of these methods.245 Ethiopia \u00ad Article 4(1)(e) of the Proclamation246 states that methods for the treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, as well as diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body shall not be pate ntable. But Article 4 (2) states that subarticle 4 (1)(e) shall not apply to produ cts for use in any of the methods of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, as well as diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body. Ghana\u00ad As per section 1(3)(d) of Ghana's Patent Law of 1992, methods of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, as well as d iagnostic methods are not regarded as inventions. This provision also states that the exclusion shall not apply to products for use in any of these methods.247 Kenya Section 21(3)(c) of the Industrial Property Act 2001 excludes methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, as well as diagnostic methods from patent protection.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 43 43III. THE ORDRE PUBLIC AND MORALITY EXCLUSIONS A. Introduction The 'ordre public' and 'morality' exclusions to patentability, are both terms filled with inherent ambiguity since the scope of their application is largely dependent on the local cultures and practices of member states. In terms of the historical underpinnings of this exclusion, there is very little academic literature available. Any debate on the inclusion of morality in determining the patentab ility of a subject matter will mirror the law and morality debate that has dogged the scholars of jurisprudence especially in the last century. The essential que stion in this debate is whether law is a reflection of morality or whether law can be d ivorced from morality. The positivist school of law would argue that law has to be divorced from morality and instead based on the rules of logic and reason.267 The school of natural law on the other hand would argue that the law necessarily refl ects the morals of society and that it cannot be based solely on rules of reason a nd logic.268 In the context of patent law therefore the positivist would arg ue that an invention should be granted a patent as long as it is novel, inventive an d displays an industrial application and that morality, unless welldefined in terms of the law, should have no role to play in the decision to grant or withold a patent. T he school of natural law would present a diametrically opposite argument stating that an invention which offends society's morals should not be granted a patent regardl ess of whether it fulfills the standard patentability criteria. The reason for th i s b e i n g t h e n a t ur a l school of law's fundamental premise that law is a reflection of morals and something that offends the morality of society cannot possibly be given a legal character. While this is of course an oversimplification of the highly nuanced debate between scholars of jurisprudence, it does capture the bare essence of the debate on the inclusion of the morality dimension within the patentability cr iteria of Article 27 of the Agreement related to the Trade Related Intellectual Propert y rights (TRIPs). Article 27.2 of TRIPs allows cou ntries to exclude from patentab ility those inventions which may offend the morality or ordre public of its populace. The proviso, which states that such an exclusion cannot be made merely because the exploitation of the invention in question is prohibi ted by their law, ensures that the conclusion of morality has to be based not only on the law but also certain e xtraneous factors, such as the morality of society, which in itself is not clearly defined within the TRIPs agreement itself. The reason to not provide precise definitions was deliberate since TRIPs was only meant to provide a minimum standards with adequa te flexibility for member states.269 267 See generally P.J. Fitzgerald (ed.), Salmond on Jurisprudence , (Universal law Publishing, New Delhi 1966). 268 Ibid. 269 In a speech by Mr. Maran, the Indian Minister of Commerce, wh ile introducing the Patent (Amendment) Act, 2002 which was a imed at making Indian pat ent law TRIPs compliant, he stated and quite rightly that \"We are all aware that the text of the T RIPS is a masterpiece of ambiguity, couched in the language of diplomatic compromise, resulting in a verbal tightrope walk, with a prose remarkably elastic and capable of being stretched all the way t o Geneva.\", available at SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 44 44While most of the TRIPs debates have seen a tension between the developing and developed world, the Article 27.2 debate is unique for the cont rast and differences t h a t i t b r i n g s o u t a m o n g s t t h e d e v e l o p e d c o u n t r i e s t h e m s e l v e s . The debate highlighted above in the context of natural law and positive la w is probably best captured in the contrast between the approaches adopted by the United States of America and the European Union. While the United States of America never had a morality require ment in its statutory patent law, such a requirement was carved out by the judiciary under the guise of a moral utility requirement.270 For over 200 hundred years the moral utility requirement was rarely used either by the USPTO or the judiciar y. The only exception was in the case of inventions related to gambling dev ices, wherein the USPTO was regularly rejecting patenting applications on the gro unds that some of these inventions lacked 'moral utility' since they could be use d for the purposes of gambling.271 However even these rejections came to an end in 1977 when the USPTO decided that a patent for a invention that could be used for ga mbling was no more or no less immoral than for an invention such a gun which may end up being using in murders.272 Thus, for over 200 years this morality doctrine was rarely inv oked. However, in the late nineties, w ith researchers and scientists pushing biotechnology to its limits by filing admittedl y controversial patent applica tions, the USPTO has invoked the moral utility doctrine to draw the line for future patent applicants and at one point even issued an official communication reiterating the moral utility doctrine and its willingness to use it.273 While rejecting a patent application related to human/animal chimeric embryos, the USPTO did not invoke the moral utility doctrine but it did in part base its actions on the U.S. Consti tution. The reference to the Constitution was widely interpreted as meaning a reference t o t h e 1 3th amendment to the U.S. Constitution - i.e. the right against ser vitude or slavery.274 The U.S. Courts however have been critical of the USPTO's reite ration of the morality utility doctrine since according to them it is the legislature and not the executive w h i c h c a n d e f i n e t h e b o u n d a r i e s o f a n a t i o n s ' m o r a l i t y .275 I t m u s t h o w e v e r b e clarified that the USPTO's rejection on the basis of the moral utility doctrine is confined to a few, rare patent applications like the human/anim al chimeric embryos and the predominant U.S. approach towards controversial technol ogies is to 'patent first and ask questions later'.276 http://commerce.nic.in/writereaddata/publications/wto_may2002.p df.

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 45 45The European Union on the other hand has adopted a more proact ive approach toward the questions of 'morality' and 'ordre public' while gra nting patents. This is evidenced by the fact that the European Patent Convention has h ad the 'morality' and ordre public requirement in its law since its very inception in the year 197 3.277 One of the interesting distinctions between the morality exclus ion in TRIPS and the EPC is that while TRIPs allows member countries to incorporate this exclusion at their discretion, the EPC mandatorily requires all member count ries to provide for a morality & 'ordre public' exclusion.278 When the EPO started receiving an increased number of biotechnology patent a pplications the E.U. responded by issuing the Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC which clearly defined those biotec hnological inventions that would be deemed unpatentable in Europe. Althoug h the exclusion under 98/44/EC has not been articulated in the language of mora lity, it was a result of the debates in Europe over the morality of patenting certain b i o t e c h n o l o g y inventions derived from the destruction of human embryos or man ipulation of genetic structures. It is interesting to note that even within t h e E U t h e r e w a s opposition to the adoption of the Biotech Directive. The Kingdo m of Netherlands for instance attempted to oppose the Directive and in fact it unsuc cessfully approached the European Court of Justice in this regard.279 Therefore unlike the U.S., the E.U. prefers to ask questions first before deciding to grant controv ersial patents. However, as explained above, even within the E.U., the decision to ban patents on grounds of morality was not unanimous. The most vibrant public debates regarding the morality and ordre public exclusion have been confined mostly to the economies of the developed wor lds i.e. the United States and the European Union. T o date, the E.U. is probably th e only signatory to the TRIPs agreement to have had extensive judicial interpretation o f these doctrines. The rest of the world, despite having an ordre public and morality exclusions have rarely invoked the morality doctrine to reject a patent applica tion. Part of the reason could be the fact that the biotechnology industries and market of these countries is yet to advance to the stage of the United States or European Un ion because of which innovators are not even filing such controversial patent applic ations in these countries. Scientists in the developed countries are pushing the boundarie s of known science in a manner which sometimes conflicts with the religious and political ideals of the p o p u l a t i o n s o f t h o s e c o u n t r i e s . T o t h a t e x t e n t t h e ' o r d r e p u b l i c' and 'morality' debate in developed countries is not really centered on increasing access to medicines in a manner likely to benefit public health. The only country in which 'ordre public' and morality exclusion to patent law has been in voked in the context of public health is India. The one decision on these lines is h owever pending appeal before the Supreme Court which s hould likely deliver a judgment within a year. In other countries like Australia and Canada where there is no statutory 'morality' 277 See generally European Patent Convention (1973). 278 Article 53 of the EPC starts off by stating that \" European patents shall not be granted in respect of.....\" 279 C377/98 before the European Court of Justice. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 46 46exclusion to patentability there have been isolated calls for s uch an exclusion. In the Oncomouse case, where the question was essentially of 'morality' in othe r jurisdictions, the Canadian Supreme Court managed to deny a pat ent by distinguishing between 'higher life forms' and 'lower life form s'.280 D e s p i t e t h e Commissioner of Patents deciding to invoke a public policy doct rine to dismiss the patent application the Canadian Supreme Court refused to uphold the decision on t h e g r o u n d s t h a t t h e C a n a d i a n P a r l i a m e n t h a d n o t i n c l u d e d s u c h an exclusion despite having multiple opport unities to consider the same.281 In countries like Japan and New Zealand, both of which have sta tutory morality e x c l u s i o n s t o p a t e n t a b i l i t y , c o n t r o v e r s i a l p a t e n t s l i k e t h e W A R F patents for inventions related to human and animal embryos have been grante d.282 Part of the reason for this seems to be the reluctance of the national pate nt offices in these countries to be drawn into the 'morality' debate. This is a phe nomena affecting most patent offices world wide and for good reason. Morality is a qu estion of public policy, which can be decided only by the representatives of the people. The most competent arbiters of morality, if at all there is somebody, ar e the legislators who are elected by citizens of a cou ntry and not appointed bureaucr ats, who have neither the mandate nor the expertise to make judgments on the basis of morality. In this respect it is only the EU, which by specifically codifying its moral concerns, regarding the use and patenting of embryos, into the EPC, has s ucceeded in providing a reasonable and successful basis for prohibiting cer tain types of patents related to the biotechnology field. By codifying a country's mo rality into its patent l e g i s l a t i o n , t h e p a t e n t o f f i c e i s r e q u i r e d t o a p p l y o n l y t h e l a w and not make judgments of morality. The best manner therefore to apply the A rticle 27.2. e x c l u s i o n , i s t o i n s i s t o n c o d i f i c a t i o n o f t h e c o u n t r y ' s m o r a l concerns into a legislation. Some Muslim countries like Qatar and Morocco base their moralit y judgments on religious beliefs which in turn are codified in Sharia law or t he Quran. These countries may therefore be in a better position to articulate t heir moral concerns, than secular countries which depend on their legislatures to de fine the prevalent morality. One of the problems with continuing to have 'morality' as a cri teria, for patentability is the fact that several inventions will have multiple uses of which only one may be immoral. For example although alcoholic beverages may be consid ered immoral in several countries, including India283, certain types of alcohol have vital medical 280 Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [2002] 4 S.C.R. 45 (Can.). 281 Ibid. 282 Infra n. 316. 283 For example Article 47 of the Indian Constitution (a Directiv e Principle of State Policy), requires that \"the state shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of t he consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injuriou s to health\". Article 47 however is part of a Directive Principle of State Policy and belongs to a Chapt er in the Indian Constitution which is not justiciable before a Court of Law. Some Indian states like Guja rat have codified this constitutional provision into legislations and have therefore prohibited the c onsumption of alcohol within its b o u n d a r i e s . I t f o l l o w s t h e r e f o r e t h a t e v e n p r o d u c t i o n o f a l c o h o l within Gujarat's boundaries is prohibited. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 47 47applications. This was the same scenario with the gambling mach ine patents in the U.S.A., all of which could have been used for several other app lications, with gambling being only one of the options especially since gamblin g is a crime based on the state of mind and intention of the person so carrying out t he Act. Therefore prohibiting the patenting of certain inventions on the grounds of morality is a double edged sword and needs t o be exercised carefully. While banning patents on the grounds of morality is bound to af fect funding for certain kinds of research, such a ban in no ways guarantees the end to such research. It may then be asked as to what purpose such a ban on patenting would serve. The answer is simple - it sends out a political message reiterating that civilized society finds it against public policy and democratic norms to allow fo r ownership and monopolies over certain inventions, no matter how beneficial th ey may prove to mankind in the long run.284 Such an exclusion is meant to remind society and its inventors that the 'means' matte r as much as the 'ends' that ar e sought to be achieved. B. Important Concepts in Regards Article 27.2 of Trips (1) Scope of Article 27.2 - The 'ordre public' & 'morality' exclusion Article 27.2 of TRIPs states that Members may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law. The ' ordre public' or 'morality' exclusion of Art. 27.2 is one of the grounds to e xclude subject matter from the purview of the TRIPs agreement. The phr ase ' ordre public' is derived from French Law and is a term that is not easy to trans late into English.285 A c c o r d i n g t o o n e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n , t h e p h r a s e \" e x p r e s s e s c o n c e r n s a b o u t m a t t e r s threatening the social structures which tie a society together i.e. matters that threaten the structure of civil society as such.\" 286 'Morality' on the other hand is defined as \"degree of conformity of an idea to moral principles \"287. Being reflective of the then prevailing principles of a society, it is a relativ ely subjective standard. 'In other words, given that the definition of both, ' ordre public' and 'morality', depends on the sociocultural, religious values of individual member st ates, it is not possible to provide a objective definition of the same. The only well de fined, aspects of this e x c l u s i o n , a r e e x p l a i n e d i n t h e l a t t e r h a l f o f A r t . 2 7 . 2 , a s t h ose inventions, the commercial exploitation of which has to be necessarily banned i n order to protect human, animal or plant life or the environment. Art. 27.2 also makes it clear that 284 Supra n. 276, 545. 285 U N C T A D - I C T S D , Resource Book on TRIPs and Development , (Cambridge University Press, New York 2005), 375. 286 Ibid 287 Frank Abate (ed.), The Oxford American Dictionary of Current English, (Oxford University Press, 1999), available at http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t21.e19923 . (Last visited on August 11, 2010). SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 48 48'such exclusion' cannot be allowed 'merely' due to the fact tha t an existing law of a member state prohibits exploitation of the invention in questio n. This proviso is necessary since most inventions can have a dual purpose of whic h only one purpose maybe illegal and prohibited. The legality or illegality of the purpose itself is defined in terms of the mens rea or mental intent of the person carrying out the Act. For example while a gun could be used to kill a person, the context of the killing i.e. murder or self defence can be established only in a court of la w and while the use of a gun for murder is prohibited b y the law, the use of a gun for selfdefence is legal. (2) 'Commercial exploitation' : It is a moot question as to whether Article 27.2 can be invoked only in those circumstances when the commercial expl oitation of the invention, sought to be excluded, is expressly banned by the la ws of the member states. A literal reading of Art icle 27.2, especially the phras e, 'the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation' seems to indica te that a member state can invoke the exclusions under Art. 27.2 only when the member state in question has banned, under its laws, even the commercial exploitation/sa le of the invention. According to one authority this exclusion cannot be invoked, if the invention itself may be sold or distributed in the member state, which seeks to ban the patenting of the same.288 Other authorities however argue that an explicit legal ban on t he commercial exploitation of the invention is not necessary in order to excl ude the invention from the list of patentable subject matter under Art. 27.2. Instead , it is argued that Article 27.2 \"does not require an actual ban of the commercialization as a condition for exclusions; only the necessity of such a ban is required.\"289 Therefore according to this interpretation, a member state need not establish that a b an on commercial exploitation actually exists but instead, it would suffice for such a member state to argue that a ban on commercial exploitation is a necessity in l ight of the prevailing circumstances in the member country.290 These authorities support their argument on the basis of the qualification that exists in the latter hal f of Article 27.2 \" such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law\". This qualification requires an objective assessment of the exclusion s independent of the existing prohibitions in the law . While this interpretation doe s seem plausible on a literal reading of the provision, it would seem impractical to exclude an invention f r o m b e i n g p a t e n t e d , d e s p i t e t h e r e b e i n g n o l e g a l b a r a g a i n s t c ommercially exploiting the invention. (3) 'State Practice' : As is obvious from the above explanation, a state cannot simp ly prohibit the patenting of all pharmaceutical products on the gr ounds that it offends the 'morality' and 'ordre public' of its citizens, while allowi ng for the commercial exploitation of such pharmaceutical products by its citizens. A ccording to one authority, it may be possible to invoke the Article 27.2 except ion in those 288 Infra n. 291, 1213. 289 Dan Leskien & Michael Flitner, 'Intellectual Property Rights and Plant Genetic Resources: Options for a Sui Generis System' (Issues in Genetic Resources No. 6 June 1997), International Plant Genetic Resources Institute. 290 Ibid. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 49 49circumstances wherein all developing countries decide to suspen d the patentability of certain pharmaceutical products on the ground of ordre public and morality.291 Such a collective suspension would lead to the creation of a ne w state practice. However, according to the above cited authority, in order to ci rcumvent the 'commercial exploitation' requir ement of Art. 27.2, the exploit ation of the pharmaceutical products in question would have to be on a notf orprofit basis.292 This possible theory is however qualified with the caveat that it is speculative and depends to a large extent on the future interpretation of Artic le 7 & 8 of TRIPs.293 (4) Patent Office as an 'arbiter' of morality : One of the main issues with vesting patent offices with the power to determine the 'morality' of an invention is that 'morality' is essentially a question of policy and since the pa tent office consists of bureaucrats who are appointed and not elected, they do not have the necessary mandate to make exclusions based on the grounds of 'morality'. Further since patent examiners are generally scientists or engineers who have degree s in science and engineering and not 'morality' they would be not be adequately trained or qualified to make judgments on the 'morality' of an invention.294 T h e c o n t r o v e r s y surrounding the EPO patent oppositions on the grounds of 'moral ity' and the EPO's and the NZPO's reluctance to get drawn into 'morality' based de bates is further proof of the fact that patent offices are probably not the best forums to decide morality.295 In the context of biotechnology inventions in the U.S., one sc holar has opined the following: \" Because the patenting of morally controversial biotech research involves such serious, deeply felt issues, the patenting decision must not be left, as it currently is, to scientists pushing the frontiers of technology, motivated by factors beyond public comment and scrutiny. No one person is competent to decide and resolve these moral issues and determine what the limits should be. Difficult though the task may be, Congress, through legislation, is the only actor competent to clarify the limits of patentable subject matter and the extent to which moral issues should be considered in patentability determinations, if at all.\"296 Therefore the best manner to exploit this TRIPs exclusion is to legislate on it through the legislature, preferably on the lines of the E.U Biotech Dir ective i.e. technology specific legislation. C. International Organizations (1) African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI) The African Intellectual Property Organization also known as th e Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle (OAPI) finds it legal basis in Article 19 of the Paris Convention, which reserves the rights of individual membe r states to enter 291 Carlos Correa, 'Integrating Public Health Concerns into Paten t Legislation in Developing Countries', South Centre, Geneva, 2000, 11, available at http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/ fr/d/Jh2963e/6.html. (Last visi ted on August 1, 2010). 292 Ibid, 13. 293 Ibid, 15. 294 C y n t h i a M . H o , supra n. 274, 283. 295 Benjamin D. Enerson, 'Protecting society from patently offens ive inventions: The risk of reviving the moral utility doctrine', 89 Cornell L. Rev. 685 (2004), 709. 296 M a r g o B a g l e y , supra n. 276, 546. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 50 50into specific agreements with each other as long as these agree ments do not specifically contradict the Convention itself. On this basis 16 African members states came together in order to form a single body, the OAPI, which w ould in turn act as the national patent rights autho rity for each of them. The memb ers of the OAPI, which are mainly French speaking countries, are as follows: Ben in, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central Africa, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guin ea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad, Togo. Th e current patent law of this organization is governed by the Bangui Agreement, which was adopted by the member states on 2nd March, 1977. Article 6 of the Bangui Agreement deals with the subject of \"No nPatentable Subject Matter\". In pertinent part it states that, \"Patents shall not b e granted for inventions the exploitation of which is contrary to public policy and mora lity, provided that the exploitation of the invention shall not be considered contrary to public policy or morality merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation\". Arti cle 6 o f t he Bangui Agreement therefore fully exploits the exclusions grante d under Article 27.2 TRIPs. In fact the Article 6 exclusion is slightly broader than the exclusion in Article 27.2 since it uses only the word 'exploitation' and not 'commer cial exploitation'. (2) African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) While OAPI is an organization of primarily French speaking Afri can nations, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) is an organization of primarily English speaking African nations. The organization wa s established in 1976 through the Lusaka Agreement and it aims at harmonizing th e intellectual property legislations of all its member states. ARIPO is also a uthorized to grant and administer patents on behalf of its member states. The principl e protocol dealing with patents is the Harare Protocol, which was adopted on Decem ber 10th 1982 and amended subsequently in the following years. The following memb ers of ARIPO are signatories to the Harare Protocol - Botswana, The Gambia, Ghan a, Kenya, Lesotho, M a l a w i , M o z a m b i q u e , N a m i b i a , S i e r r a L e o n e , S u d a n , S w a z i l a n d , U g anda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia or Zimbabwe. Section 3 of the Protocol deals with patentability criteria etc . In particular Section 3(10) of the Protocol states in no uncertain terms that, \" Inventions for which patents are granted by the Office shall be new, shall involve an inventive step and shall be industrially applicable. \" This protocol however does not fully exploit the exclusions provided under Article 27.2 of TRIPs, in the sense that it does n o t e x c l u d e a n invention from being patented on the grounds that the exploitat ion of the patent is against ordre public and morality. (3) Andean Pact The Andean Pact is a supranational legislation, which provides the basic IP legal system to the countries under the Pact (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecua dor, and Peru). The Andean Pact suggests only the minimal levels of protection that is required. Member States are free to add ancillary domestic provisions to the exi sting rules in the Treaty. Some of the member states like Colombia have relinquish ed the right to provide for an independent domestic legislation. Yet other coun tries like Venezuela SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 51 51in 2008 have abandoned the Pact and instead revived its 1955 IP domestic law. Decision 486 of the Commission of the Andean Community is the l aw, which prescribes the minimum patentability criteria for the contracti ng states. Article 20 of this Decision also specifies the grounds on which an invention may be excluded from patent protection. As per Art. 20 (a), those inventions, the co mmercial exploitation of which is required to be prevented in order to protect 'publi c ordre' or morality, p r o v i d e d t h a t s u c h e x c l u s i o n i s n o t m a d e m e r e l y b e c a u s e t h e e x p loitation is prohibited or regulated by a legal or administrative provision. Interestingly the Andean Pact divorces into a separate provision (Art. 20(b), the A r t i c l e 2 7 . 2 qualification, of including withi n the definition of 'ordre pub lic' or 'morality', any prohibition that is necessary \"to protect human, animal or plan t life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment\". Since Article 27.2 has effectively been split into two distinct provisions by the Andean Pact the 'ordr e public' and morality requirements of Article 20(a) will have to be determined indepe ndently of the criteria in Article 20(b). D. The European Patent Convention 2000 Article 53(a) of the European Pa tent Convention 2000 provides t hat European patents ' shall not be granted in respect of inventions the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to \"ordre public\" or morality' and that ' such exploitation shall not be deemed to be so contrary merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation in some or all of the Contracting states'. Rule 28 of EPC 2000 which corresponds to Article 53 of EPC, 2000 states the following: Rule 28 Exceptions to patentability : Under Article 53(a), European patents shall not be granted in respect of biotechnological inventions which, in particular, concern the following: (a) processes for cloning human beings; (b) processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings; (c) uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes; (d) processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes. (1) The Onco\u00adMouse decision : The scope of the morality exclusion under Article 53(a) of the EPC was first debated in the 1989 Onco\u00adMouse decision. The subject matter of this patent application filed in 1985, were mice whic h had been genetically modified to carry an activated oncogene, by researchers at Harv ard, to make them more susceptible to cancer. The object of the invention was to use these mice for cancer research. At the stage of examination of the patent appl ication, the Examining Division of the European Patent Office did not apply the 'moral ity' exclusion under Article 53(a) on the grounds that it was not staffed with peopl e qualified to make j u d g m e n t s o n m o r a l i t y . I t r e j e c t e d t h e a p p l i c a t i o n o n t h e g r o u n ds that animal SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 52 52varieties were not patentable under the EPC.297 On appeal however, the Technical Board of Appeal considered it necessary to apply the 'morality' exclusion under Article 53(a). The Technical Board of Appeal was of the view th at genetically modifying a mammal to ensure it developed cancer was highly pro blematic, since s u c h g e n e t i c m o d i f i c a t i o n s a n d t h e r e s u l t a n t c a n c e r w o u l d n e c e s sarily cause suffering to the animal.298 The Board of Appeal therefore remitted the application to the Examining Division with instructions that while considering morality, the patent office should balance the invention's utility to mankind with t he suffering caused to animals and the possible risk to the environment. In line with the Board of Appeal's instructions, the Board held the genetically modified mouse to be patentable on the grounds that cancer research was to the benefit of humanity.299 While considering the suffering caused to mice the Examining Division reasoned th at cancer research would take place anyway and that it would require the sourcing of several mice to locate the ones which had 'naturally' developed cancer; the inv ention under consideration however benefited mice since it would reduce the large number of m i c e t h a t w o u l d h a v e o t h e r w i s e b e e n s o u r c e d a n d s u b s e q u e n t l y d e stroyed by laboratories for cancer research. Based on this utilitarian fra mework, the EPO therefore went ahead to grant a patent for the genetically modi fied mouse. (2) The Upjohn case: In this case, a pharmaceutical company had filed a patent application covering a mouse into which a gene had been introdu ced so as to cause the mouse to lose its hair. The EPO applied the same utilitaria n test that it had developed in the Oncomouse case but with different results. Af ter balancing the b e ne f i t s o f t h e i nv e n t i o n i n e xp e r i m en t s t o c ur e h a i r l o s s , as against the harm suffered by the mice, the EPO came to the conclusion that the i nvention was immoral and would therefore not be patentable.300 (3) The Plant Genetic Systems Case :301 In this case, the patent which was granted for a genetically engineered plant which rendered the plants re sistant to herbicide, was opposed by Greenpeace on the grounds that such an invention was inherently immoral and also that it created risks to the environment. Appl ying the utilitarian approach, formulated in the OncoMouse case, Greenpeace argued for the possible risks to be balanced against the benefits likely to accrue from the invention. The Opposition Division of the European Patent Office refused to co nsider the patent on the basis of the utilitarian theory developed in the OncoMouse case on the grounds that they were primarily concerned with the technical aspect of the invention and that they were not competent or qualified to decide ethical iss ues. Instead, the Opposition Division held that the 'ordre public' & 'morality' e xclusion would be invoked only in those cases where the invention was regarded to be so outrageous that there was an overwhelming consensus that no patent should be granted for the same. The EPO therefore required that a certain threshold be cr ossed before the application of the morality test. With this decision the EPO c onsiderably narrowed 297 Harvard/Onco \u00admouse, T19/90 (1991) EPOR 525 (Exam). 300 Independent (2 Feb. 1992). 301 [1993] 24 IIC 618. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 53 53the application of the morality in the patent system. The decision of the Opposition Division was appealed to the Technical Board of Appeal. While d ismissing the appeal the Board of Appeal held that although the morality provision i s to be considered normally it should not be disregarded by the patent office even in those cases where it is difficult to judge whether the claimed subject matter wou ld offend 'ordre public' and morality. (4) The Relaxin case: In this case, the Howard Florey's Institute was granted a patent for the DNA sequences of a naturally occurring substance , which is obtained from the human o var y and whic h rela xes t he u terus duri ng chi ld birth.302 T his patent was opposed by the Green Party on three grounds: (i) Tha t the use of pregnancy for profiteering was o ffensive to human dignity; (ii) that the applicant was involved in patenting life itself and that the same was int rinsically immoral; and (iii) such patenting was equivalent to slavery. The EPO rejecte d these objections on the grounds that the tissue that was used in the research was d onated during the course of necessary gynaecological operations and therefore did not offend 'human dignity'. Moreover, the EPO held the DNA to be a 'chemical subs tance which carries genetic code' and not 'life'. The 'slavery' analogy was also sh ot down by the EPO on the grounds that the opponents had failed to appreciate the tru e nature of patent right which did not grant a monopoly over life but simply a rig ht to prevent others from practising the same invention. (5) The Transgenic Animals decision : The scope of the 'morality' exclusion in Article 53(a) was once again considered by the Technical Board of Appeal (EPO) in its 2006 Transgenic Animals d e c i s i o n . I n t h i s a p p e a l a g a i n s t t h e O r d e r o f t h e Opposition Division in the year 2003, the Technical Board of Ap peal was required to consider whether the patent could stand in an amended form to c over all transgenic rodents, i.e. genetically modified rodents could be excluded fr om patentability under the morality requirements of Article 53.303 In its decision, the Technical Board of Appeal ruled that the w ords 'contrary to ordre public o r m o r a l i t y ' i n A r t i c l e 5 3 o f t h e E P C w a s no t c o n c e r n e d w i t h e ither the morality of the process of genetically manipulating a mouse nor with the technique o f s u c h m a n i p u l a t i o n . I n s t e a d , t h e T e c h n i c a l B o a r d o f A p p e a l s t ressed that the 'morality' provision of Article 53 was concerned with the moral ity of exploiting such a genetically modified organism or the method to carry out such g e n e t i c manipulation304. The Board further confirmed that the utilitarian approach lai d down by the Opposition Division in the 1991 Oncomouse decision (T 19/90) was the correct approach to be taken by the Court while deciding th e suitability of bringing the invention under the 'morality' requirement of Arti cle 53 EPC. The Board however rejected the amendment aimed at covering all rodents on the grounds of EPC 2000 Rule 28 which clearly states that under Art icle 53A, European Patents shall not be granted in respect of biotechnological inv entions which in particular concern the following (I) process for cloning huma ns (ii) processes for 302 Howard T 315/03 (2006) OJEPO 15, 29 (TBA). SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 54 54modifying the germ line genetic identify of human being (iii) u ses of human embryos for industrial or commercial process and (iv) process for modif ying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering wi thout any corresponding medical benefit to man or animal and also causes animals resulting from such processes. The applicant's main request claiming 'tra nsgenic rodents', (which meant claiming all animals within the taxonomic order Rodentia), was rejected on the basis of the balancing test in this Rule, since the applicants failed to show the medical benefits of conducting such tests on the entir e taxonomic order, instead of only mice. The claims with respect to only 'mice' ho wever survived the original utilitarian test since the applicants were able to dem onstrate increased medical benefits vis\u00e0vis mice. (6) The 'University of Edinburgh's human embryo patent' : In the year 2002, the University of Edinburgh was granted a patent for an invention i n the field of development biology. The patent in question \"described a method of using genetic engineering to isolate stem cells - including embryonic stem ce lls - from more differentiated cells in a cell culture in order to obtain pure cell cultures.\"305 The patent was challenged by the Governments of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands along with the German branch of Greenpeace, on the grounds that such an invention was against 'ordre public' and morality. On concluding the hear ings, the Opposition Division at the EPO held that the University of Edinburgh's con troversial human embryo patent did not comply with EPC 2000 Rule 28(c) and Artic le 53(a) of the EPC 2000.306 (7) The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) case:307 The question that arose in this case was whether or not human embryonic stem cell (HESC)s were patentable or not. While the EPO had been granting patents for stem cell research, the issue with the HESCs was that the method of extraction inev itably led to the destruction of the human embryo. As already discussed, Article 53(a) prohibited the grant of patents for those inventions which were against 'ordre public' & morality, w h i l e R u l e 2 8 ( c ) s p e c i f i c a l l y p r o h i b i t e d t h e p a t e n t i n g o f h u m a n embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.

(Last visited on August 11, 2010). 306 Patent EP 695351, granted by EPO Dec. 1999. See EPO press rel ease, 'Edinburgh patent limited after European Patent Office opposition hearing' (24 Jul. 2002) . Rule 28 reads as follows: Exceptions to patentability : Under Article 53(a), European patents shall not be granted in respect of biotechnological inventions which, in particular, concern the following: (a) processes for cloning human beings; (b) processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings; (c) uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes; (d) processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes. 307 Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation , Case G 0002/06, Eur. Patent Off., 2326 (Nov. 25, 2008), (2009) 5 OJEPO 306. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 55 55Enlarged Board of Appeals (EBoA). The EBoA issued its ruling in November 2008 in which it refused to allow WARF's patent for the HESCs to procee d as the same was against \"the public order and morality requirements of Article 53(a) & Rule 28(c) of the EPC 2000.\" The EBoA was partly guided by the Biotech Direct ive of the E.U. which incorporates ethical considerations into the patentabilit y analysis.308 (8) Eurasian Patent Convention : T h i s t r e a t y i s a d m i n i s t e r e d b y t h e E u r a s i a n Patent Organization (EAPO). The members of the EAPO are mainly former members states of the USSR and include the following: Turkmenistan, Rep ublic of Belarus, Republic of Tajikistan, Russian F ederation, the Republic of Aze rbaijan, Republic of Kazakhstan, the Krygyz Republic, the Republic of Moldova, Georg ia, Ukraine and R e p u b l i c o f A r m e n i a . I t m u s t b e o b s e r v e d t h a t n o t a l l o f t h e s e countries are signatories to TRIPs. Some of these countries like the Russian Federation are only observers and not signatories to the WTO and its ancillary trea ties. The main aim of this convention is to create a single patent system for all the member states in order to avoid duplication of resources. The Eurasian Patent Conventi on does not provide for any exclusion from patenting on the grounds of 'ordre publi c' or 'morality'. E. Individual Countries (1) Albania Albania is a member of the European Patent Convention (EPC) and is governed by a patent law which is referred to as the Committee of Science and Technology Order, No. 1707, of December 29, 2008, Rules for Patents. Article 6 of this legislation contains an elaborate exclusion from patentability on the groun ds of public order and morality. Article 6(1) states that patents shall not be gra nted to inventions, the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to public or der, morality or public health and human life. This provision of law further cla rifies that such exploitation may be deemed to be so contrary even if it has not been so banned expressly by law or regulation. The legislation therefore vests in the patent office a wide discretion to decide when exploitation of an invention is offensive to public order, morality or health. Clause 6 further incorporates provis ions of the E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/EC, by specifically prohibiting \"a) pro cesses for cloning human beings; b) processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings; c) uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial p urposes; d) processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which a re likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man o r animal, and also animals resulting from such processes.\" Albanian patent law the refore appears to exploit the scope of the exclusi on under Article 27.2 of TRIPS. 308 \"Whereas, moreover, uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes must also be excluded from patentability; whereas in any case such exclusion does not affect inventions for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes which are applied to the human embryo and are useful to it;\" Clause 42 of the Directive 98/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July, 1998 on the legal protection of biotec hnological i nventions. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 56 56(2) Armenia The relevant patent legislation of Armenia is the Industrial Pr operty Law, 2008. Article 10 of this legislation l ists all the exceptions to pate ntability. Of particular relevance to this paper is Article 10(2): Inventions, the exploitation of which contradicts the public interests, morality, philanthropy principles shall not be subject to legal protection. The nature of the exclusion under Article 10(2) of the relevant Armenian law, especially the 'philanthropy' principle, prima facie, seems to be much broader than the exclusion un der Article 27.2 of TRIPs. (3) Argentina The relevant patent legislation of Argentina is Law No. 24. 481 enacted in the year 1995 and amended subsequently. Article 7 of the same law, deems unpatentable, the inventions whose exploitation in the Argentinean territory shou ld be prevented so as to protect public good or morality, the health or life of pe rsons or animals, the conservation of plants or the avoidance of serious damage to th e environment. Although similarly worded to Article 27.2 of TRIPs this provisi on does not state that the exploitation of the inventio n has to be of a commercial nat ure. (4) Australia The relevant patent legislation of Australia is the Patents Act , 1990, as consolidated in 2010. The Australian legisla tion does not incorporate an ex press 'ordre public & morality' exclusion as envisaged by Article 27.2 of TRIPs. This legislation however does stipulate that \"human beings, and the biological processes for their generation, are not patentable inventions\". In essence these are exclusions t o p a t e n t a b i l i t y which can be defended on the basis of the basis of the 'ordre p ublic' and 'morality' exclusions of Article 27.2 of TRIPs. (5) Bahrain The relevant patent legislation of Bahrain is Law No. 1 of 2004 in Respect of Patents and Utility Models, as amended by Law No. 14 of 2006. Under Article 3 of this law the Kingdom of Bahrain may prohibit the patenting of any invent ions the commercial exploitation of which is imperative for the protecti on of public order or principles of morality; including the protection of humans life or health or that of animals or plants or to avert causing serious harm to the envir onment. (6) Bangladesh The relevant patent legislation of Bangladesh is the Patent & D esigns Act, 1911. This legislation does not provide for the 'ordre public' or morality exclusion from patent law. In this sense Bangladesh is not fully exploiting the exclu sions that are found in Article 27.2 of TRIP. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 57 57(7) Belize The relevant patent legislation of Belize is the Patents Act, C hapter 253 (revised edition 2000). As per Article 12(3)(a) of this legislation a pa tent shall not be granted for an invention, the commercial exploitation of which is neces sary to protect public order or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such refusal shall not be based solely on the grounds that the commercial exploitation of such an invention is prohibited by a law in force in Belize. (8) Bolivia The relevant patent legislation in Bolivia is the Industrial Pr operty Law, 1912. According to Article 3 of this law, patents can be denied to in ventions the exploitation of which would be contrary to law, public safety, or decency or morality. This provision therefore adequately exploits the exclusion unde r Article 27.2. Although Article 27.2 does not e xpressly include the term ' dec ency', the same can be read into the undefined terms of 'morality'/ 'ordre public'. (9) Brazil The relevant patent legislation in Brazil is Law No. 9.279/96. Article 18 of this legislation states that any invention contrary to morality, dec ency or public safety, order and public health shall be excluded from the scope of pat entable subject matter. Article 18(II) further goes on to prohibit the patentin g of all or part of living things even though they may have satisfied the requirements of patentability and were not mere discoveries. Although this provision does not exp ressly use the words 'ordre public' or 'morality' the scope of the provision e ssentially takes shelter under the Art. 27.2 he ading of 'morality'. (10) Bulgaria The relevant patent legislation of Bulgaria, a member of the EP C, is a legislation which was originally promulgated in the State Gazette in the ye ar 1993 and consequently amended in the years 1993, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002 & 2007. As per Article 7 of this legislation a patent shall not be granted for inventions the commercial use of which would be contrary to 'social order or m orality', including \"(a) methods of cloning human beings; (b) methods of altering the genetic identity of human embryo; (c) use of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes;(d) methods of modifying the genetic identity of animals, where this may cause them suffering without any substantial use from a medical point of view for humans or animals, as well as animals obtained by such methods; \". Thus, Article 7, in effect incorporates the E.U. Directive on Biotechnology - 98/44/EC. (11) Cambodia The relevant patent legislation of Cambodia is the 'Patents & U tility Models & Industrial Designs, law of 2003'. Article 9 of this legislation states that inventions, the commercial exploitation of w hich would be contrary to publi c order or morality or prohibited by law would not be patentable under the legislat ion. This provision therefore adequately exploits the scope of the 'ordre public' o r 'morality' exclusion available in Article 27.2 of TRIPS. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 58 58(12) Canada The relevant Canadian patent legislation is the Patents Act, 19 85 as amended several times over the last decades. This legislation does not provide for any specific 'ordre public'/morality exclusion from p atentability. In the controver sial Oncomouse decision the Commissioner of Patents turned down the patent app lication for the Harvard Oncomouse. This invention basically involved injecting cancer cells into mice so as to enable the cancer to develop within them in a man ner which would be useful for animal carcinogenic studies. The Commissioner of Pat ents initially rejected the patent application on grounds of public policy. Th e Canadian Supreme Court while overturning the decision of the appeals court309 held that the 'public p o l i c y ' c o u l d n o t b e g r o u n d s f o r r e j e c t i n g a p a t e n t s i n c e P a r l i ament did not incorporate an 'ordre public' or 'morality' exception into the Patent Act despite having an opportunity to do so while it was amending the Patent Act to make it compatible with TRIPS and NAFTA, both of which provide for such an exclusion.310 As a result 'ordre public' and morality as a grounds of exclusi on to patentability have no basis in Canadian law. (13) Chile The relevant, revised patent legislation in Chile is law no: 19 .039, 2005 (Establishing the Rules Applicable to Industrial Titles and the Protection of Industrial Property Rights). Article 38 of this law excludes from the definition of patentable subject matter those inventions, the commercial exploitation of which m ust be necessarily prevented in order to protect public order, state security, mor als & decency, the health or life of people or animals, or to preserve plants or t he environment, provided that the exclusion is not made for the sole reason tha t a legal or administrative provision exists prohibiting or regulating that exploitation. The provision therefore adequately exploits the exclusion under Art icle 27.2 of TRIPs. (14) China The relevant patent legislation in China is 'The Patent Law of the People's Republic of China', 2000 as amended in the subsequent years. Article 5 o f this legislation states that no patent right shall be granted for any invention that contravenes any law or social moral or that is detrimental to public interest. Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPS which states that an exclusion shall not be made simply f or the reason that its exploitation is prohibited by the law, this Chinese legislation allows for excluding protection merely on the grounds that the invention contravenes any law. Further unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs the Chinese exclusion does not see m to require the exploitation to be of a 'commercial' nature. The Chinese State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) gives some examples of few such inventions which are not patentable311: (1) Processes for cloning human beings and human beings being cloned (2) Processes for modifying the germ line identity of hu man beings (3) Uses 309 President and Fellows of Harvard College v. Commissioner of Patents, Federal Court of Canada, File: T27596; April 21, 1998. 310 Harvard College v.

These guidelines virtually mirro r the European law on the point. (15) Colombia This country follows the Andean Rules with no domestic legislat ion supplementing it and therefore automatically has the same exclusions that exist under the Andean Pact. (16) Croatia The relevant patent legislation in Croatia is the 'Patent Act a nd Amending Patent Act and Act on Amendments to the Patent'. Article 7 of this legisla tion states that inventions shall be considered unpatentable where their commer cial exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality. In addition to t his, Article 7 also incorporates the E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/EC by expressly prohibiting the process for cloning human beings, process for modifying the ger m line genetic identity of human beings, uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes and also processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes. (17) Cyprus The relevant patent legislation of Cyprus is the Patent Law of 1998. Article 5 of this legislation states that a patent shall not be granted in respec t of an invention the publication or exploitation of w hich would be contrary to publi c order or morality, provided that the exploitation shall not be deemed to be so con trary merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation. This provision does not state that the exploitation is required to b e of a commercial nature. (18) Czech Republic The relevant patent legislation of the Czech Republic is the La w No. 527/1990 of Coll., Act on Inventions, Industrial Designs and Rationalisatio n Proposals, as amended by the Law No. 519/1991 of Coll. Via an Amendment Act d ated 2000, Section 4 (a) was amended to introduce an exclusion to patentab ility on the grounds of 'ordre public' and 'morality'. In pertinent part the exclusi on reads as follows: \"inventions, the exploitation of which would be contrary to pub lic order or morality; this fact may not be concluded merely because the exploitation of the invention is prohibited by law\". This provision does not state that the expl oitation is required to be of a commercial nature. (19) Denmark The relevant patent legislation of Denmark is the Patents Act a s amended over several years. Section 1(b) of the legislation states that pate nts shall not be granted in respect of inventions the commercial exploitation of which w ould be contrary to ordre public or morality provided that an exploitation shall not be deemed to be so contrary merely because the exploitation is prohibited by law o r administrative regulation. This legislation additionally incorporates the E.U. Biotech Directive - SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 60 6098/44/EC - in Article 1(b) therefore banning the patenting of a ll processes for cloning human beings, processes for modifying the germ line, th e use of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes and processes for modifying the g e n e t i c i d e n t i t y o f a n i m a l s , w h i c h p r o c e s s m a y c a u s e t h e m h a r m that is not proportional to the benefit to mankind. (20) Ecuador The relevant patent legislation in Ecuador is Codificaci\u00f3n 2006 013. According to Article 126 of this law patents are to be denied to inventions, t h e c o m m e r c i a l exploitation of which must be prevented as necessary to protect morality. Patents are also denied on absolute grounds to inventions, the commerci al exploitation of which must be prevented as necessary to protect public order in cluding to protect the health or life of humans or animals or plant life or to pre vent serious damage to the environment or ecosystem. (21) Egypt The relevant patent legislation in Egypt is the Law on the Prot ection of Intellectual Property Rights (Law No. 82) which was adopted on 3 June 2002. Under Article 2 of this law patents shall not be granted for inventions whose expl oitation is likely to be contrary to public order or morality, or prejudicial to the env ironment, human, animal or plant life and health. This provision does not state that the 'exploitation' is required to be of a commercial nature. (22) Estonia Estonia is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Estonia is the Patent Act, 1994 as amended consequently in the years 2000, 200 1, 2002, 2003 & 2004. Section 7 of this legislation lists all the inventions th at are deemed to be 'unpatentable inventions'. Included in Clause (1)(1) of this pr ovision are any inventions which are contrary to public order and morality. Thi s provision does not state that the 'exploitation' is required to be of a commercial nature. In addition, Section 7 of this legislation also incorporates the E.U. Biotec h Directive 98/44/EC, which prohibits the patenting of all processes for cloning huma n beings, processes for modifying the germ line, the use of human embryos for indus trial or commercial purposes and processes for modifying the genetic identity of an imals, which process may cause them harm that is not proportional to the benefit to mankind. (23) Ethiopia The relevant patent legislation in Ethiopia is titled 'Proclama tion No. 123/1995 concerning Inventions, Minor Inventions and Industrial Designs' . Section I, Article 4(a) of this legislation deems any invention contrary to public order or morality as unpatentable. (24) France France is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in France is Book VI of the Intellectual Property Code - 'Protection of Inventions a nd Technical Knowledge'. As per Article L61117 of this Code 'Inventions sha ll be considered unpatentable where their commercial exploitation would be incon sistent to public policy or morality, however such inconsistency may not emanate from a prohibition by law or regulation.' In addition to this exclusion, France ha s also incorporated the SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 61 61E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/EC and has thereby prohibited proc esses for cloning human being, modifying germline identity, use of human embryos , partial s e q u e n c e s o f a g e n e , a n i m a l v a r i e t i e s , e s s e n t i a l b i o l o g i c a l p r o c e s s e s f o r t h e production of plants and animals, processing for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without substa ntial benefit to man or animal. (25) Finland Finland is a member of the EPC.

S e c t i o n 1 ( b ) o f C h a p t e r I o f t h i s legislation states that patents shall not be granted for invent ions the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to ordre public or mora lity provided that the commercial exploitation may not be considered to be contrar y to ordre public or morality merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation. In addition to this exclusion Finland has also incorporated the E.U. Biotech Direct ive 98/44/EC thereby expressly prohibiting a range of inventions related to the fiel d of biotechnology. (26) Germany Germany is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Germany is the Patentgesetz (Patent Law) or the Patent Act of December 16 as last amended by the law of 31st J u l y , 2 0 0 9 . A s p e r S e c t i o n 2 o f t h i s l e g i s l a t i o n , i n v e n t i o n s w hose commercial exploitation would be contrary to public order or mo rality, would be u n p a t e n t a b l e , p r o v i d e d h o w e v e r t h a t s u c h p a t e n t i n g s h a l l n o t b e unpatentable solely due to the fact that the exploitation is prohibited by l aw or regulation. This legislation also incorporates the E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/ EC thereby expressly prohibiting a range of inventions relating to the field of biot echnology such as human cloning, the use of embryos for commercial or industrial purposes, the modification of genetic identity of human beings, the modificat ion of the genetic i d e n t i t y o f a n i m a l s i n t h o s e c a s e s w h e r e s u c h m o d i f i c a t i o n d o e s n o t c a u s e substantial medical benefits to man or animal kind.

As per Section 17 of this legislation a patent i s not granted for an invention the commercial exploitation of which m ay cause inhuman, immoral and/or antisocial action. (28) Ghana Ghana is a member of ARIPO. The relevant patent legislation of Ghana is the Patent Law, 1992, PNDCL, No. 305A. As per Section 6 of this legislatio n 'a patent shall be obtained in respect of an invention the exploitation of which i s prohibited by law, except where the prohibition relates to public order or moralit y.' Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this provision does not require the exploitation to be of a commercial nature. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 62 62(29) Guyana The relevant patent legislation of Guyana is the Patent and Des igns Act, 1973. This l e g i s l a t i o n d o e s n o t p r o v i d e f o r a n o r d r e p u b l i c o r m o r a l i t y e x clusion to patentability. (30) Greece Greece is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Greece is the 'Law on Technology Transfer, Inventions and Technical Innovation as amended in subsequent years. Section 8 of the law states that patents shal l not be granted in cases where the inventions, the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to ordre public or morality. This provision does not require the exploitation to be commercial in nature. Additionally Section 8 also prohibi ts the patenting of plant or animal varieties or biological processes for the produ ction of plants or animals. Greece has also incorporated the E.U.Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC through Presidential Decree No. 321/2001. As already explained above th is Directive prohibits the patenting of inventions relating to the field of biotechnology such as human cloning, the use of embryos for commercial or industrial purposes, the modification of genetic identity of human beings, the modificat ion of the genetic i d e n t i t y o f a n i m a l s i n t h o s e c a s e s w h e r e s u c h m o d i f i c a t i o n d o e s n o t c a u s e substantial medical benefits to man or animal kind. (31) Hungary Hungary is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Hungary is the 'Law No. XXXIII of 1995 on the Protection of Inventions by Pate nts'. Article 6 of this legislation states that no patent protection may be granted for an invention if the publication or exploitation thereof would be contrary to public policy or morality; exploitation may not be regarded as contrary to public policy m erely because it is prohibited by law or regulation. In addition to this provision Hungary has also incorporated the E.U. Biotech Di rective 98/44/EC via Act XXXIX of 2002. As a result of this Directive Hungarian law prohibits the patenting of inve ntions relating to the field of biotechnology such as human cloning, the use of embryo s for commercial or i n d u s t r i a l p u r p o s e s , t h e m o d i f i c a t i o n o f g e n e t i c i d e n t i t y o f h u man beings, the modification of the genetic iden tity of animals in those cases where such modification does not cause substantial medical benefits to man or animal kind. (32) Iceland Iceland is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Iceland is the Patents Act, 1991 as amended in the year 1993, 1996 etc. Sectio n 1, Part I of this legislation states that a patent shall not be granted for inven tions the use of which would be contrary to morality or public order. In addition the plant or animal varieties or essentially biological processes for the productio n of plants or animals are considered to be unpatentable. Additionally, Iceland has en acted a legislation implementing the E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/EC on the 11th of May, 2004. As a result of this Directive Iceland now prohibits the patenting of inventions relating to the field of biotechnology such as human cloning, the use of em bryos for commercial or industrial purposes, the modification of genetic identity of human beings, the modification of the genetic iden tity of animals in those cases where such modification does not cause substantial medical benefits to man or animal kind. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 63 63(33) India Section 3(b) of the Patent Act, 1970 states that the following shall not be considered inventions: (b) an invention the primary or intended use or commercial exploitation of which could be contrary to public order or morality or which causes serious prejudice to human, animal or plant life or health or to the environment The Draft Patent Office Manual, 2008, which is only indicati ve and not binding on the examiner cites the following examples to indicate the kinds of inventions which may be prohibited by Section 3(b):312 a. Any device, apparatus or machine or method for committing theft/burglary, b. Any machine or method for counterfeiting of currency notes, c. Any device or method for gambling d. Inventions, the established or intended use or commercial exploitation of which is found to be injurious to public, animal or plant life or health, such as, a method of adulteration of food. e. An invention, the present or intended use of which is likely to violate the well accepted and settled social, cultural, legal norms of morality, e.g. method of cloning f. An invention, the primary or proposed use of which would disturb the public order e.g. a device for house\u00adbreaking. g. Terminator gene technology So far there has been few reported cases in India, wherein the patent office or the judiciary have denied a patent on grounds of Section 3(b) of th e Patent Act, 1970. In one unreported decision of the patent office, a patent was deni ed to an invention related to medicinal powder prepared from skeletal remains of d ead bodies dug up within a week of burial on the grounds that digging up graves f or profitoriented purposes was immoral.313 The one case which was widely reported was the case of Novartis AG v. UoI & Ors.314. The IPAB (Intellectual Property Appellate Board)in this case denied Novartis a patent on grounds of excessive pricing i .e. the anti cancer drug, Gleevec that was sought to be patented was priced very hi ghly in India and 312 Indian Patent Office, Draft Manual of Patent Practice and Procedure , (2008), 56, available at http://ipindia.nic.in/ipr/patent/DraftPatent_Manual_2008.pdf .

SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 64 64was out of the reach of the common man. In pertinent part, the IPAB held: \" in our view[the drug] is too unaffordable to the poor cancer patients in India. Thus, we also observe that a grant of product patent on this application can create a havoc to the lives of poor people and their families affected with the cancer for which this drug is effective. This will have disastrous effect on the society as well. Considering all the circumstances of the appeals before us, we observe that the Appellant's alleged invention won't be worthy of a reward of any product patent on the basis of its impugned application for not only for not satisfying the requirement of section 3(d)of the Act, but also for its possible disastrous consequences on such grant as stated above, which also is being attracted by the provisions of section 3(b) of the Act which prohibits grant of patent on inventions, exploitation of which could create public disorder among other things.\" It is important to note that the patent was denied on the groun ds of \"public order\" and not morality. This case is currently pending appeal before the Supreme Court of India. (34) Indonesia The relevant patent legislation in Indonesia is the Patent Law as amended by law No. 14 on August 1, 2001.

Section 10 of this legislation states that a p a t e n t s h a l l n o t b e g r a n t e d i n r e s p e c t o f \" a n i n v e n t i o n t h e p ublication or exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or mora lity, provided that the exploitation shall not be deemed to be so contrary only bec ause it is prohibited by law.\" Unlike Art. 27.2 of TRIPs this provision does not requ ire that the exploitation be commercial in nature. Additionally Ireland too has incorporated the E.U. Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC via 'The European Communities (Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 247 of 2000)' and given effect to it in 30th J u l y , 2 0 0 0 . T h e s e r e g u l a t i o n s e l a b o r a t e i n g r e a t d e t a i l t h e biotechnological inventions that are deemed unpatentable under Irish law. (37) Japan The relevant patent legislation in Japan is the Patent Law (Law No. 121 of 13 April 1959, as last amended by Law No. 79 of 4 June 2004). Article 32 of this legislation states that inventions liable to contravene public order, moral ity or public health shall not be patented notwithstanding the fact that the inventi on would have otherwise passed the patentability criteria laid down in Articl e 29 of the same legislation. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 65 65 (38) Jordan The relevant patent legislation in Jordan is the Patents of Inv ention Law No. 32 of 1999 as amended by Temporary Law No. 71 of 2001. Article 4(2) o f this legislation states that inventions the exploitation of which would be contr ary to public order or morality may be excluded from patent protection. This legislati on also prohibits the patenting of inventions, the prevention of its commercial explo itation, is necessary to protect life and health of hu mans, animals, or plants or to avoid serious prejudices to the environment. A proviso to both provisions states that th e exclusion of protection is not made merely because the invention's exploitat ion is prohibited by other legislation in force. (39) Kenya The relevant patent legislation in Kenya is the Industrial Prop erty Act No. 3 of 2001. As per Article 26(b) of this legislation those inventions contr ary to public order, morality, public health and safety, principles of humanity and environmental conservation are not patentable. Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPS t his provision does not have a 'commercial exploitation' requirement. (40) Latvia Latvia is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Latvia is the Patent Act, 2007. Article 9 of this legislation excludes from patent ability those inventions which offend the morality of society. In addition Latvia has al so incorporated the E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/E through a legislation which came into effect from the 29th of December, 2005. (41) Malaysia T he rel eva nt pat ent legisl ati on in Malaysia i s A ct No . 291 of 1 983 as amended several times later, the latest amendment being in the year 200 6. Section 31 of this legislation was amended in 2000 via Amendment Act A1088 to excl ude from the purview of patentability those inventions, the exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality. In regards the 'public or der' and 'morality' exploitation the Patent Office Manual states that the purpose o f this provision is to exclude from protection inventions likely to induce riot or pub lic disorder, or to lead to criminal or other generally offensive or immoral behaviour. As an illustration the manual cites the example of a letterbomb as one of the inventi ons that would be excluded from the purview of this legislation. The Manual also assures that this provision is likely to be invoked in rare and extreme cases. A 'fair test' according to t h e M a n u a l w o u l d b e w h e t h e r o r n o t t h e p u b l i c i n g e n e r a l w o u l d regard the invention as so abhorrent that t he grant of patent rights would be inconceivable. (42) Mexico M e x i c o , a s t a t e w h i c h i s a s i g n a t o r y t o t h e N o r t h A m e r i c a n F r e e Trade Treaty (NAFTA), does provide for an exclusion to patentability on the grounds of public order and morality. The relevant patent legislation in Mexico i s the Industrial Property Law. Article 4 of the Industrial Property Law denies p atent protection to any inventions in order to protect ordre public or morality, in cluding to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious preju dice to nature or the SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 66 66environment, provided that the exclusion is not based solely on the ground that the law prohibits commercial exploit ation of the subject matter of the patent within its territory. (43) Morocco The relevant patent legislation in Morocco is the Morocco Indus trial Property Act, Act No. 1797 (Feb. 9th 2000). As per Article 24(a) of this legislation, inventions th at are contrary to public order and morality are not eligible for patent protection. In the opinion of one authority 'morality' and 'public order' must be interpreted in a broad sense as taught under Islam in accordance with the Koran.315 (44) Mozambique The relevant patent legislation in Mozambique is the Industrial Property Code Decree No. 04/2006 of 12th April, 2006. As per Art. 30 of this legislation inventions which are contrary to morality, bonos mores, public safety, public order and public health are excluded from patent protection. Unlike Article 27.2 this provision does not require that the exploitation of the invention be of a 'com mercial nature'. (45) Netherlands Netherlands is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legisla tion in Netherlands is the Patents Act, 1995 as amended in subsequent years. As per Article 3 of this legislation no patents shall be issued for inventions the publi cation or exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality. In regards the E.U. Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC, the Kingdom of Netherlands initially brou ght a case C377/98 before the European Court of Justice arguing against the adopti on of the directive. The ECJ however did not entertain Netherland's plea. As a resul t Netherlands did enact a legislation on the 11th of November, 2004 to incorporate the E.U. Biotech Directive. As per this legislation Netherlands will have to res trict the patentability of certain inventions related to the field of biotechnology. (46) New Zealand The relevant patent legislation in New Zealand is the Patents A ct, 1953 as amended during the subsequent years. Under Section 17(1) the Commission er of Patents may reject a patent application on the grounds that the invention c laimed by it would be contrary to law or morality. An interesting decision in which S ection 17 came into play was that of the Assistant Commissioner's in the case of th e patent application filed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and Wicell Re search Institute Inc, Decision of the Assistant Commissioner.316 At issue in this case were two patent applications: (i) NZ 532170 - filed in the name of Wisconsin Al umni Research F o u n d a t i o n ( W A R F ) c l a i m i n g a m e t h o d f o r i n d u c i n g p r i m a t e s t e m c ells to differentiate; & (ii) NZ 535243 - filed in the name of Wicell R esearch Institute (WRI) claiming a method for inducing primate stem cells to differenti ate. Both applications w e r e r e j e c t e d b y t h e E x a m i n e r o n t h e g r o u n d s o f S e c t i o n 1 7 ( 1 ) . Both Parties appealed to the Assistant Commissioner against the orders of th e examiner. The applicants targetted the application of the 'morality' requirem ent, primarily on the 315 Tshimanga Kongolo, 'Morocco's Patent System and its Internati onal Connection', 42 IDEA J. L. & Tech. 181 (2002), 185. 316 P22/2007 SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 67 67grounds that there was absolutely no definition of morality eit her in the legislation or in the form of judicial precedent therefore making it imposs ible to judge the standards for the same.317 The applicants then referred to the common definitions of 'morality' and convincingly established before the Asst. Commis sioner that the methods claimed by them in their patent applicants did not offe nd these definitions of morality, since these methods were not \"diametrically oppose d to behaviour which New Zealand society believes to be right conduct, that be lief being deeply rooted in our culture.\" The Assistant Commissioner agreed with these contentions after considering domestic legislation on the issue of research into stem cells and embryos. The Asst. Commissioner noted that although such resear ch was strictly controlled by the Government it was not completely prohibited. As a result both applications were deemed not contrary to the morality and ordre public of New Zealand and were therefore allowed by the New Zealand Patent Of fice. (47) Nigeria The relevant patent legislation in Nigeria is the Patents and D esigns Act, Chapter 344, Law of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990. As per Section 1(4 ) of this law patents \"cannot be validly obtained in r espect of inventions the public ation or exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality (it being u nderstood for the purposes of this paragraph that the exploitation of an inventio n is not contrary to public order or morality merely because its exploitation is pro hibited by law).\" Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this provision does not require th e exploitation to be of a commercial nature. (48) Norway Norway is a member of the EPC. T he relevant patent legislation in Norway is the 'Lov om patenter' (Act No. 9 of Decem ber 15, 1967 on patents). As pe r Section 1(b) of this legislation inventions shall be considered unapatentable where their commercial exploitation would be contrary to ordre public or morality. An explanation to the section states that exploitation shall not be deemed so contrar y merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation. Additionally Norway has also i ncorporated the E.U.Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC through a Parliamentary legisl ation in the year 2 0 0 3 a n d w h i c h c a m e i n t o f o r c e o n 0 1 . 0 2 . 2 0 0 4 . A s a r e s u l t c e r t a in inventions pertaining to the biotechnology sector are not patentable. (49) Pakistan The relevant patent legislation in Pakistan is the Patent Ordin ance, 2000. Section 7(4) of this legislation excludes from the patentability criter ia any invention the commercial exploitation of which would be need to be prohibited in order to protect the \" ordre public\" or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provid ed that such exclusion is not made merely bec ause the exploitation is prohib ited by any law for the time being in force. 317 Julie Ballance & Fiona Pringle, 'Morality & Patentability - stem Zealand', available at http://www.baldwins.com/moralit yandpatentabilitystemcellp atentsinnewzealand/ . (Last visited on August 11, 2010). SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 68 68(50) Paraguay The relevant patent legislation in Paraguay is Law No. 1.630/00 . According to Article 5 of this law invention whose commercial exploitation should be necessarily prevented to protect public order or morals, protecting health, peoples or animals lives, avoid damages to the envi ronment, are excluded from pate nt protection. (51) Peru After the revocation of Peru's prior intellectual property legi slation in the year 2008, the country has essentially been ruled by the Andean Pact. Ther e have been further amendments as a result of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with t he United States of America. As discussed earlier in this report the Andean Pact do es provide for an exclusion to patentability on the basis of the 'ordre public' a nd morality. (52) Philippines The relevant patent legislation of the Philippines is the Intel lectual Property Code (Republic Act No. 8293). Section 22(6) of this legislation excl udes from the definition of patentable subject matter any invention which is contrary to public order or morality. Unlike Article 27 of TRIPs this legislation does not specify whether the exploitation of the invention should be commercial or not. (53) Poland Poland is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Peru is the Industrial Property Law (Journal of Laws of 2003, No 119, text 1117 and of 2004, No 33 text 286). As per Article 29 of this Code \"patents shall not b e g r a n t e d f o r inventions whose exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality\" provided that the exploitation shall not be deemed to be so con trary merely because it is prohibited by law. Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this prov ision does not require the exploitation in question to be of a commercial nature. Addi tionally Poland has incorporated the E.U. Biotech Directive 98/44/EC via statutory amendment in the year 2000 which was effective from the year 2002. As a result P oland now prohibits a range of inventions pertaining to the field of biotechnology. (54) Portugal Portugal is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislatio n in Portugal is the Industrial Property (No. 36/2003) Code as subsequently amended in the following years. Article 21, of the consolidated code, expressly states t hat \"inventions whose commercial exploitation is against the law or contrary to publi c policy, public health or morality are not patentable and their exploitation may not b e considered as such due to the simple fact that is forbidden by law or regulation.\" Additionally Portugal has also incorporated the E.U. Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC - i nto its law via a Parliamentary amendment in the year 2002. This amendment came i nto force in the year 2003. (55) Qatar The relevant patent legislation in Qatar is the 'Patents' Law' (Decree Law No. 12 for the year 2003). This law was enforced only from the year 2006 t hrough decree law no: 30 for the year 2006. Article of Qatar's main patent legisl ation states that patents shall not be granted for inventions that are \"contradicting wit h the provisions of Islamic Sharia' (Law), violating the public order, ethics or na tional security.\" The SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 69 69wording of this provision may be broader than the TRIPS enclosu re since firstly u n l i k e A r t i c l e 2 7 . 2 o f T R I P s t h e Q a t a r i p r o v i s i o n d o e s n o t h a v e a 'commercial exploitation' qualification. Secondly Islamic Sharia law is a large body of law with multiple interpretations. (56) Romania Romania is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Romania is the Patent Law No 64/1991 as amended in the subsequent years. Accor ding to Section 12, Chapter II of this legislation \"Inventions contrary to mora lity or public policy shall not be patentable\". Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this pro vision does not have a qualifying requirement of 'commercial exploitation'. Additional ly Romania has amended its Patent Law No. 64/1991 via Law No. 203/2002 of 19th April, 2002 with the purpose of incorporating the E.U. Biotech Directive - 98/44 /EC. As a result a n u m b e r o f i n v e n t i o n s i n t h e b i o t e c h n o l o g y s e c t o r a r e n o w p r o h i b ited under Romanian law. (57) Serbia Although Serbia is not currently a member of the EPC it has bee n invited to accede to the same. The relevant patent legislation in Serbia is Patents Law, 2004. As per Article 7 of this legislation patent protection shall not be gr anted in respect of \"inventions the commercial use of which would be contrary to ordre public o r m o r a l i t y . \" T h e p r o v i s o s t a t e s t h a t u s e o f a n i n v e n t i o n s h a l l n o t be considered contrary to ordre public or morality merely because it is prohibited by law or any other regulation. Although Serbia is not a member of EPC, the l anguage of Article7 prohibiting the patenting of human embryos etc. is similar if n ot identical to the language used in E.U. Biotec h Directive (98/44/EC). (58) Slovak Republic Slovakia is a Member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislatio n in Slovakia is the Industrial Property (Inventions Designs), Law, 27/11/1980, No. 527. As per Section 4 of this legislation patents shall not be granted in respect o f \"inventions contrary to public interest, particularly the principles of humanity and mo rality.\" Additionally the Slovak Republic has also amended its law in 2001 to incorpo rate the E.U. Biotech D i r e c t i v e 9 8 / 4 4 / E C . A s a r e s u l t c e r t a i n i n v e n t i o n s r e l a t e d t o t he field of biotechnology are unpatentable. (59) Slovenia Slovenia is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislatio n in Slovenia is the Industrial Property Law 2001. Article 11 of this legislation st ates that a patent shall not be granted for \"inventions the exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality\". Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this legislati on does not require the 'exploitation' to be of a commercial nature. Additionally Slove nia has also i n c o r p o r a t e d t h e E . U . B i o t e c h D i r e c t i v e 9 8 / 4 4 / E C i n t o i t s n a t i o nal law via a statutory amendment published on 18th of August, 2003. This amendment came into force in the year 2003. As a result a range of inventions relat ed to the biotechnology field are now prohib ited in Slovenia. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 70 70(60) Singapore The relevant patent legislation in Singapore is the Patents Act , (No. 24 of 2001) as subsequently revised in the years 1995, 2002 & 2005. As per Sec tion 13(2) of this legislation, \"an invention the publication or exploitation of w hich would be generally expected to encourage offensive, immoral or antisocial behavio ur is not a patentable invention\". Section 13(3) clarifies that behaviour s hall not be regarded as offensive, immoral or antisocial only because it is prohibited by any law in force in Singapore. (61) South Africa The relevant patent legislation in South Africa is the Patents Act, 1978. As per S e c t i o n 2 4 ( 4 ) ( a ) o f t h i s l a w p a t e n t s c a n n o t b e g r a n t e d f o r a n i nvention the p u b l i c a t i o n o r e x p l o i t a t i o n o f w h i c h w o u l d b e g e n e r a l l y e x p e c t e d to encourage offensive or immoral behaviour. Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs th is legislation does not require the exploitation to be of a commercial nature. (62) South Korea The relevant patent legislation in South Korea is the Patents A ct, 1978 as amended in the subsequent years. As per Section 25(4)(a) of this legisl ation a patent shall not be granted \"for an invention the publication or exploitation of which would be generally expected to encourage offensive or immoral behaviour. \" Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this legislation does not require the exploitati on to be of a commercial nature. (63) Spain Spain is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation i n Spain is the Patents (Utility Models), Law, 1986. As per Section 5(1)(a) of this leg islation \"inventions whose publication or working would be contrary to public order or morality\" cannot b e t h e s u b j e c t m a t t e r o f a p a t e n t . A d d i t i o n a l l y S p a i n h a s i n c o r porated the E.U. Biotech Directive - 98/44/EC - through Law No. 10/2002 of 29th April, 2002. As a result a certain range of biotechnological inventions are unpat entable subject matter in Spain. (64) Suriname This country applies the patent legislation in force in Netherl ands. (65) Sweden Sweden is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Sweden is the Patents Act, 1967, as amended in the subsequent years. As per S ection 1 of this legislation patents may not be granted to \"inventions the use o f which would be c o n t r a r y t o m o r a l i t y o r p u b l i c o r d e r \" . S w e d e n a l s o a d o p t e d t h e E.U. Biotech Directive through an Act of Parliament on the 1st of May, 2004. As a result a range of inventions related to the biotechnology field are unpatentable. (66) Switzerland Switzerland is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legisla tion in Switzerland is the 'Federal Law on Patents for Inventions, 1954'. Article 2 of this legislation defines the inventions that are excluded from patentability. As per sub section (a), \"inventions the implementation o f which would be contrary to pu b l i c o r d e r o r SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 71 71morality would not be patentable\". Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIP s this provision does not elaborate on whether the 'implementation' is required to be of a commercial nature or not. (67) Thailand The relevant patent legislation in Thailand is the Patent Act B .E. 2522 (1979). As per Section 9 of this legislation, inventions contrary to public or der, morality, health or welfare are not patentable. Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this p rovision does not have a 'commercial exploitation' qualification. (68) Tunisia The relevant patent legislation in Tunisia is the Law No. 2000 84 of August 24, 2000, on Patents. Section 3 of this legislation states that a patent may not be issued for \"inventions the publication or implementation of which would be contrary to morality, public policy, public health or the protection of the environment\". Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this provision does not seem to require a 'commercial exploitation' requirement. (69) Turkey Turkey is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation in Turkey is the DecreeLaw No. 551 on the Protection of Patent Rights, 1995. Se ction 6 of this legislation states that patents shall not be granted for invent ions related to \"subject matter contrary to public policy or generally accepted standard s of morality\". Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this provision does not seem to r equire a 'commercial exploitation' requirement. (70) Uganda The relevant patent legislation in Uganda is the Patents Act, 1 993. This legislation does not provide for an exclusion based on 'ordre public' and ' morality'. (71) United Kingdom The United Kingdom is a member of the EPC. The relevant patent legislation is the Patents, Act, 1977. Section 1(3) of this legislation states tha t \"a patent shall not be granted for an invention the commercial exploitation of which w ould be contrary to public policy or morality\". Section 1(4) of the same legislatio n clarifies that exploitation shall not be regarded as contrary to public policy or morality only b e c a u s e i t i s p r o h i b i t e d b y a n y l a w i n f o r c e . T h e U n i t e d K i n g d o m has also incorporated the E.U. Biotech Directive in stages thereby deemi ng certain inventions pertaining to the field of bio technology as unpatentable. (72) United States The patenting system in the U.S.A. is rather unique in the sens e that is one of the few countries in the world to provide for the right to patent in th e constitution itself. The U.S. Patent Act is the legislation which regulates this con stitutional right. Unlike most other national patent law legislations, the U.S. Patent Ac t does not exclude inventions on the grounds of 'ordre public' & 'morality'. Howe ver, this is not to say that the U.S.A. has not witnessed any of morality related debat es with respect to the scope of patentable subject matt er allowed by its patent law. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 72 72The 1817 case of Lowell v. Lewis318 was the first to lay down the judicial doctrine of beneficial utility. Interpreting the 'utility' requirement in t he old Patent Act of 1790, it was held by the Lowell Court that an otherwise patentable invention would be unpatentable if it is \" injurious to the well being, good policy, or sound morals of society. The word \"useful,\" therefore, is incorporated into the act in contradistinction to mischievous or immoral. For instance, a new invention to poison people, or to promote debauchery, or to facilitate private assassination, is not a patentable invention. But if the invention steers wide of these objections, whether it be more or less useful is a circumstance very material to the interests of the patentee, but of no importance to the public. \" To this extent, it is important to appreciate that \"utility\" it self becomes a patent eligibility criteria, as opposed to a patentability criteria. Subsequently in the 1960 case of in Re Nelson319, the Lowell dicta was once again reiterated by the United States Court of Customs & Appeals. In pertinent portion the Board held that \" The word 'useful' is not supposed to be used, for the purpose of establishing general utility as the test of a sufficiency of invention to support a patent. It had been held, upon the use of the same word in the old patent act of 1793, that it was used merely in contradistinction to what is frivolous or mischievous to society. This term was held to be satisfied, if the alleged invention was capable of use, and was not injurious to the well\u00adbeing, good policy or sound morals of society.\" In a 1991 decision320 of the 2nd Federal Circuit Court cited the above two precedents to interpret the utility requirement of Section 101 of the Pate nt Act to include the possible moral implications of an invention on society. In pert inent part the Court held that \" Section 101 has also been interpreted to exclude inventions deemed to be immoral, such as (until 1977) gambling machines, or devices deemed to be scientifically impossible, such as perpetual motion machines. \" In the year 1998, the United States Patents & Trademarks Office ( U S P T O ) , i n response to a patent application for animalhuman hybrids (chim era), issued an office statement, citing the decisions in the Lowell's and Tol\u00ado\u00adMatic cases, indicating that \" inventions directed towards human/non \u00adhuman chimeras could, under certain circumstances, not be patentable because, among other things, they would fail to meet the public policy and morality aspects of the utility requirement .\"321 The USPTO therefore attempted to bring in the 'morality' aspect under the existing 'utility' requirement in Section 101 of the U.S. Patent Act. A subsequent 1999 decision of the United States Court of Appeal s for the Federal Circuit urged a broader interpretation of the utility requireme nt under Section 101, arguing that the USPTO and Courts should refrain from acting as arbiters of what 318 15 Fed. Cas. 1018, 1019 (C.C.D. Mass. 1817). 319 126 20 USPQ2d 1332, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 1991). 321 Media Advisory, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 'Facts on P atenting Life Forms Having a Relationship to Humans' (Apr. 1, 1998), http:// www.uspto.gov/n ews/pr/1998/9806.jsp. SCP/15/3 Annex IV, page 73 73exactly constitutes fair practices.322 I n p e r t i n e n t p o r t i o n i t w a s h e l d t h a t \" The requirement of \"utility\" in patent law is not a directive to the Patent and Trademark Office or the courts to serve as arbiters of deceptive trade practices. Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, are assigned the task of protecting consumers from fraud and deception in the sale of food products.\"323 It is relevant to point out that although this Court refers to the precedents in Lowell, Nelson & Tol\u00ado\u00adMatic cases, it does not explicitly overrule any of the above cases. Having said that, it is also pertinent to point out that none o f these three cases actually applied the 'morality' requirement to invalidate the p atents that were being challenged before their courts. It should however be noted that despite the extensive political debate on the morality of stemcell research and the temporary ban on U.S. Go vernment funding for such research, the U.S.P.T.O. has been granting patents for such inventions since the first such grant to the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundatio n (WARF) in the year 1998.324 (73) Uruguay The relevant patent legislation in Uruguay is Law No. 17.164 (R egulating Rights and Obligations Relating to Patents, Utility Models and Industrial Designs). According to Article 14 of this law, inventions contrary to public order, ma nners, public health, population nutrition and safety of environment are unpatentable . Unlike Article 27.2 of TRIPs this provision does no t carry a qualification of 'comm ercial exploitation'. [Annex V follows] 322 Juicy Whip, Inc. v. Orange Bang, Inc., 185 F. 3D 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999). 323 Ibid. 324 Recently in April, 2010 three of WARF's patents were invalida ted. These were however invalidated on the grounds of obviousness and not morality.
