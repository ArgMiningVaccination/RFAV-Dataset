The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19, headed by Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul, and the subject expert committee under the Central Drugs Control Organisation will review its application over the next few days. - \"There are two aspects. The regulator will first look at Pfizer's data to examine safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the vaccine [for the approval]. The next thing is to scale up and make it part of the national programme. For that, the NEGVAC will consider aspects beyond regulatory clearance such as logistics, cost and, most importantly, whether the company can offer a reasonable number of doses to meet our demand and by when,\" a senior official said. - Nevertheless, India is expecting two vaccines to be available by January \u2014 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine supplied by the Serum Institute and Bharat to inaugurate construction of Agra Metro; Delhi HC to hear petitions against with Opposition support] - Leaders of 11 parties, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, DMK chief MK Stalin, Sitaram Yechury and D Raja, on Sunday said they would lend their \"whole-hearted\" support to the December 8 Bharat bandh call by farmers' unions protesting against the three agri-marketing laws and demanding their repeal. - A joint statement signed by the heads of the 11 parties said the new laws were passed in Parliament in a \"brazen anti-democratic manner\", preventing a structured discussion and voting. They also claimed the laws \"threaten India's food security, destroy Indian agriculture and our farmers, lay the basis for the abolishment of the minimum support price (MSP) and mortgage Indian agriculture and our markets to the caprices of multinational agri-business corporates and domestic corporates\". - \"The central government must adhere to democratic processes and norms and meet the legitimate demands of our 'kisans-annadatas',\" the letter said. - Shiv Sena, Trinamool, TRS, Akali Dal, AAP and BJP Assam's AGP and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party in Rajasthan \u2014 too came out in support of the stir and Bharat bandh call, though they were not signatories to the joint statement. - Earlier in the day, Congress said on December 8, the party would hold day-long protests in all district and state headquarters in solidarity with the farmers. - Also, boxer Vijender Singh visited the farmers' protest site in Delhi and said he would return Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award if the government doesn't withdraw the 'black' farm laws. - Protests also took place at several places in Canada, the US and New Zealand in support of farmers' agitation on the day.

Curbs on free speech a disservice to democracy: Attorney general] - India's top law officer K.K. Venugopal on Sunday said any move to curb free speech on social media will \"be very wrong for democracy\", adding the government and courts have the option of resorting to contempt proceedings if someone misuses the freedom. - \"Citizens, whether on social media or otherwise, must have the essential freedom to express their views about the working of institutions in a democracy,\" he told TOI when asked about attempts by some states to initiate proceeding under various provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code against social media users. - \"I will be the last person to say social media needs to be regulated in a democracy... I feel social media is essential to democracy. Authorities come to know about the views of the general public. If someone misuses the freedom, then the government can take action under the provisions of law and the constitutional courts can resort to contempt proceedings. But if freedom of speech is curtailed, it will be a great disservice to democracy.\" - The attorney general's statements come even as India has seen a sharp increase in sedition charges and invocation of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, an anti-terror law, for provocative speeches \u2014 online and offline. - According to the National Crime Records Bureau's data, 93 cases of sedition were filed in 2019, continuing a steady rise from 70 in 2018, 51 in 2017 and 35 in 2016.

And put into bat, stand-in skipper Matthew Wade gave Australia a brisk start, with some clean hitting. But India got a lucky break once he reached fifty \u2014 Kohli dropped a sitter from Wade, but still managed to run him out. The Aussie had turned on his heels as if already dismissed, taking his eye off the ball. - Steve Smith then anchored the innings as India's five-bowler attack looked exposed yet again. Barring T Natarajan (2/20) all of them went for more than eight-and-a-half an over. And cameos by Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis pushed them close to 200. - But India were aware that the Aussie attack was minus Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. And openers KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan ensured India were (slightly over) par with the hosts' Powerplay score. At the halfway stage, the visitors were 86/1. - But it was only when the equation was down to 33 off 15 balls, that the doors opened for India (four down by then). Shreyas Iyer's six and a four off Adam Zampa ensured the visitors took some momentum into the last two overs. - Hardik Pandya then did what he does best, with brutal efficiency. First, he smashed Andrew Tye for two consecutive fours in the 19th over. Daniel Sams had 14 to defend in the final over, but with a pair of towering sixes from Pandya, beyond the straight midwicket boundary, the second-highest T20I run-chase on Australian soil was achieved with two balls to spare. - The scorecard: India 195/4 (Dhawan 52, Pandya 42 not out) beat Australia 194/5 (Wade 58, Smith 46, Natarajan 2/20) by 6 wickets [NEWS IN CLUES] [5.

Gene editing gives hope for millions with sickle cell disease] - An experimental gene-editing treatment has shown promising results in studies on a chronic genetic disorder that affects millions in the world \u2014 and prevalent in 1% to 40% among different tribal groups in India. - Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia are caused by errors in the gene responsible for haemoglobin. People with the diseases inherit two copies of the faulty gene, one from each parent. Severe cases require transfusions every two to five weeks. - In India, an estimated 3.6 to 3.9 crore people carry -thalassemia, and about 10000 to 15,000 babies with -thalassemia major are born each year and around 150,000 are of patients with Thalassemia major ( [pdf](https://main.mohfw.gov.in/sites/default/files/drft%20policy.pdf?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=timestop10_daily_newsletter)).

None need regular blood transfusions and are free from pain crises that plagued their lives before. - Tell me more: In the womb, foetuses make a special type of haemoglobin. After birth, when babies breathe on their own, a gene is activated that instructs cells to switch and make an adult form of haemoglobin instead. A defect in this gene causes the disease. The treatment aims to cut out the switching gene, \"making the cells think they are back in utero\", so they make fetal haemoglobin again, said Dr. Haydar Frangoul of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville. - Get smart: This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry went to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna [8. Space exploration's Super Sunday] - Samples collected from the asteroid Ryugu arrived on Earth [on Sunday](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/asteroid-dust-collected-by-japan-probe-arrives-on-earth/articleshow/79590162.cms?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=timestop10_daily_newsletter) after separating from Japanese space probe Hayabusa-2. Entering the Earth's atmosphere, it created a shooting-star-like fireball en route to landing on a remote area in southern Australia. - At about 10 km above ground, a parachute was to open to slow its fall and beacon signals were to be transmitted to indicate its location. And a few hours later, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency confirmed the samples had been recovered, with help from the beacons; the fridge-sized probe was some 220,000 km away. - Scientists hope the precious samples, expected to amount to no more than 0.1 gm of material, could help shed light on the origin of life and the formation of the universe. - Also, the Chinese probe carrying samples from the lunar surface [successfully docked](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-12/06/c_139566627.htm?utm_source=nl_landingpage&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=timestop10_daily_newsletter) with a spacecraft orbiting the Moon on the day. Per the official Xinhua news agency, it was China's first \"rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit\". The manoeuvre was part of the ambitious Chang'e-5 mission to bring back the first lunar samples in four decades. - The cargo capsule carrying lunar rocks and soil, having lifted off from the surface on Thursday, transferred the Moon samples to the orbiter, which will separate and is expected to land on Earth, in Inner Mongolia, later in December.
