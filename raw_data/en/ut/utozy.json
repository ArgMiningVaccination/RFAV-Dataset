Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Comi rnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is and what it is used for Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. It is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is only for individuals who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID -19. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: you have ever had a severe allergic reacti on or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Comirnaty or Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA. 1 in the past. you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection .

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4) . These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccinatio n, and more often in younger males . The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised . In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19.
