Your body will release endorphins as needed. What gets rid of pain naturally? Chiropractic adjustments are a proven, scientifically-based and effective method for naturally relieving pain. You should also add natural supplements to your diet, such as turmeric and fish oils to reduce bodily inflammation. How can I ease my pain without medication? A highly effective way to relieve pain and decrease inflammation in any area of the body is to use Class IV Laser therapy. Deep tissue laser therapy creates a healing environment by bringing oxygenated blood and nutrients to the affected area, allowing the inflammation to subside. This gives your tissues the ability to jump-start the healing process in a more conducive environment. Supplements such as Vitamin D and Omega 3 fish oils have pain-relieving effects.
