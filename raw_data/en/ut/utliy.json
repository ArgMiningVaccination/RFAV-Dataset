He has also been a Chair Profes - sor at Tongji University, Shanghai since 2018. He recently spoke to Science & Technology Daily to introduce some of the most important cooperation proj - ects between China and Belgium, and the latest development trends in the constructionindustry. Science & Technology Daily: What's your first impression of China? How did you start the cooperation with Chinesecounterparts? Luc Taerwe: The first time I trav - elled to China was in 2004. When I ar- rivedinShanghaiIwasreallyimpressed by the city size, the traffic density, the livelyatmosphere,theChinesefoodand lastbutnotleast,thevarietyinbuilding styles. At that time the Oriental Pearl TV Tower and the Jin Mao Tower were the only high- rise structures in the Pudongarea. For my first visit to China, I was contacted by Prof. Yuan Yong of Tongji University to visit the Siping campus and its test facilities. Yuan is a re - nowned expert in the field of under - ground construction. I was very im - pressedbythetestfacilitiesatTongjiin thefieldofcivilandstructuralengineer - ing and the high level of research that was being performed. Prof. Yuan and I discovered that we had many common researchinterestsandthiswasthestart ofalong-lastingandintensivescientific cooperation. As director of the China Platform of GU, what role do you think the Plat - form plays in strengthening coopera - tion and exchanges between Tongji and GhentUniversity?As far as I know, Ghent University is the only Belgian University with a specificChinaPlatformthatcoordinates the cooperation with Chinese universi - tiesandscientificinstitutes,bothinthe fields of research and education. The Platform was established in 2006. We are also the only Belgian University with a representative office in China. Thisofficefacilitatestheexchangeofin - formationwithChineseuniversitiesand Chinese organizations like the China ScholarshipCouncil(CSC). The China Platform offers support to staff members who want to set up cooperation with Chinese colleagues and also to exchange students in both directions. Ghent University has more than100cooperation agreements with Chinese universities which means that we have established a very broad aca - demicnetwork. Alltheseeffortsresultedinthefact that we have about 750Chinese stu- dents at GU, and Chinese students are the biggest group of international stu - dentsatGU. Oneofthemostsuccessfulachieve - ments to mention is the establishmentof11Joint Laboratories with different Chinese Universities in different re - search disciplines. Personally, I am in - volved in the Joint Lab for industrial - izedconstructionwithTongjiUniversity. As an accomplished expert in the field of Concrete Structures, could you please introduce the latest devel - opment trend in the construction in - dustry? In recent years, there is a trend to move from classical construction, which is very labor intensive, to smart construction in which the latest tech - nologiesareapplied.Takinganexample of precast concrete, the concrete ele - mentsarecastinafactorywhilstbeing assembled at the building site. In this way, the quality of the elements are muchbetterasthemanufacturingisal - mostindependentoftheweathercondi - tions and the tolerances on the dimen - sions are smaller, compared to the on- site casting. Moreover, the construction speedcanbeincreased. Another trend is sustainable con - struction, where reduction of the CO 2 footprint is the main concern and this is for the complete life cycle of a con -cretestructure,fromcradletograve,in - cluding recycling after demolition. Ap - plied to buildings, we speak about the \"greenbuildingconcept\"wherealsothe energy consumption during use is con - sidered. It is also a trend to use other binders apart from cement. It is known that a lot of CO 2gets into the atmo - sphere during the production of ce - ment. By replacing a part of the ce - mentbyothermaterials,theCO 2emis- sion related to concrete can be signifi - cantlyreduced. What do you think of China's ef - forts in achieving green and sustain - abledevelopmentof construction? All the trends I just mentioned, are the results of recent scientific and technological developments. However, a lot of issues still need to be solved if we want to make the applications in daily construction practice possible. At many universities in China, I could see that high-level experimental facili - ties have become available with up-to- date research equipment, especially in some important laboratories. In this way China will be at the forefront of the development of the new and ad - vanced building materials and con - struction techniques. In what ways do you think peo - ple's livelihood has been improved by scientific and technological develop - mentinChina? In the past, many Chinese people were living in rather old traditional houses with little comfort, especially in rural areas. During the last decades, a lot of investments were made in new housingprojects,wherepeoplecannow live in a much more comfortable way. Also,theinfrastructure(highways,high- speed railway lines, bridges) has evolved tremendously at a very high speed,whichisreallyauniqueachieve - mentattheinternationallevel.DevelopingConcreteCooperation forAcademicExchanges In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, China launched a nation - wide mass vaccination campaign in ear - ly2021. By the end of July, more than 3.4billion COVID- 19vaccine shots had been administered on the Chinese mainland, according to the National HealthCommission(NHC). Among those aged 60and above, 89.6percent have received at least one dose,whilethefullvaccinationrateand booster vaccination rate are 84.7per- centand67.3percentrespectively. The leaders of the Communist Party of China and the central govern - ment have all been vaccinated with the domestic COVID- 19vaccines, Zeng Yix - in, vice-minister of NHC, said during a newsconferenceheldonJuly 26,noting thatChineseleadersattachgreatsignifi - cance to the pandemic control work and have tremendous confidence in the domestically developed COVID- 19vac- cines. Zeng added that all three vaccines developed domestically had obtained emergency use authorization from the World Health Organization, and over 100countries have approved Chinese- made shots for public use. Some coun - tries take China-produced vaccines as the only ones that can be used on un - deragechildren. Moreover, Zeng said that the lead - ers of more than 30countries, includ - ingTurkey,Serbia,CambodiaandChile, have been vaccinated with Chinese vac - cines. All of these facts demonstrate that vaccinations made in China are widely approved by the global commu - nity,heemphasized. Datacollectedduringthemassvac - cination campaign showed that China- produced vaccines are safe, Feng Zijian,executive vice president and secretary general of the Chinese Preventive Medi - cine Association, said at the press con - ference. According to Feng, as of May 30, a total of238,215side effect cases follow - ing vaccinations had been reported, equal to an incidence rate of 70.45per onemillionshots. Overall, the rate of side effects af - ter administering Chinese COVID- 19 vaccines was lower than that of other normal vaccines, including polio and flu vaccines, administered in China in 2020. Feng noted that there had been no safety issues over Chinese shots re - ported in overseas countries and re - gions, fully demonstrating the safety of China'svaccines. Regarding developing vaccines againstOmicron,Chinaiscurrentlycon - ducting monovalent and multivalent vaccine research and development againstOmicronvariantsthroughmulti - ple technical routes. \"Chinese vaccines still protect against severe illness and death caused by Omicron variants,\" Feng told reporters. As to rumors against use of China's COVID- 19vaccines, Wang Fusheng, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, empha - sized at the press conference that CO - VID-19vaccines do not cause leuke - mia or diabetes, nor do they cause tu - mor spreading or antibody-dependent enhancement, as some critics had claimed. The ingredients used in the vaccines are safe for humans. Wang further noted that clinical monitoring and statistical data show that in the four years before and after the COVID-19outbreak, the number of visits and hospitalizations for diabetes and leukemia are virtually the same, withnosignificantchanges.China-made Vaccines Safe, Effective ProfessorLucTaerwe.(COURTESYPHOTO) Hani Rice Terraces, the system of Hanirice-growingterraces,aremainlylo province,China,withatotalareaofover 160,000acresandahistoryofmorethan 1,300years.
