Users on social media are sharing a video of news headlines and portions of articles on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness over time without context to question whether the vaccines ever worked. An Instagram user shared the video that reads: \"This is the greatest medical scam in the history of the world!\" ( [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cllpjp9jqdo/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=75ab5954-04f2-4cbc-9aae-b128bcd28024)). Another user shared the video and said, \"Crimes against humanity. We were all lied to\" ( [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CllpmbxoTde/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=28fc4eb6-7f90-43e4-bffa-85ef4a026528)). The video includes various news headlines that appear to show COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness starting out at 100% and decreasing over time without context on what the numbers represent, echoing a false narrative that vaccines were never as effective as promised ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-coronavirus-vaccines-idUSL1N2SA1FZ)), ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaccine-reduce-idUSL1N2PC2O9)). For example, one headline shown in the video, \"The Pfizer Vaccine Is 100 Percent Effective for People This Age, Study Says\" is from an article viewable ( [here](https://bestlifeonline.com/pfizer-vaccine-effective-children-news/)). It refers only to effectiveness against confirmed COVID in a small trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 15 conducted in early 2021 ( [here](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal)). Experts told Reuters that vaccine effects will vary based on who is being tested, where, what is being measured, and how. OUTCOME OF INTEREST Vaccine \"efficacy\" and \"effectiveness\" are both measures of the reduction in cases of infection, or severe disease, hospitalizations, or deaths, seen in a vaccinated group as compared with an unvaccinated group. Efficacy is the term used for clinical trial results, and effectiveness is a real-world measure ( [here](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy) ). When the word \"effective\" is used regarding COVID-19 vaccines, it could be referring to preventing infection, severe disease, or death, and \"all these things are different and lead to different numbers,\" Tara Kirk Sell, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters. Study results will also vary depending on which variant was circulating at the time, Sell added. \"The virus that causes COVID is able to mutate in ways that allow it to somewhat evade immunity so old vaccines work less well on newer virus variants.\" Steven Bradfute, an associate professor at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, told Reuters that the decreasing percentages do not mean vaccines are no longer effective or were always ineffective. \"There's an overall message that the vaccines do work, but things have changed over time based on different circumstances,\" Bradfute said. EVOLVING VIRUS COVID-19 vaccines began clinical trials in the summer of 2020 in the U.S., and release of preliminary trial results began in November of that year, followed by rollout of the first shots starting in December 2020 ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-moderna/moderna-pfizer-start-decisive-covid-19-vaccine-trials-eye-year-end-launches-idUSKCN24S18Z)), ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-vaccines-idUSKBN28T0IQ)). Initial clinical trials for Pfizer's vaccine 95% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 ( [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?query=featured_home)) while Moderna trials showed 94% efficacy ( [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389)). Within months, real-world effectiveness studies were confirming protection of at least 75% against infections or severe illness ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/israeli-study-finds-pfizer-vaccine-85-effective-after-first-shot-2021-02-19/)), ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pfizer-covid-19-shot-effective-people-with-chronic-diseases-israel-study-2021-04-22/)). At the start of the vaccine rollout, the COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. \"were extremely effective against infection, against hospitalization and against death,\" Bradfute said. The high levels of protection continued through the emergence of the Alpha variant in early 2021, he said, which was reported to be more transmissible than the original strain of the virus ( [here](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-variants-of-concern-omicron#:~:text=Some%20mutations%20in%20Alpha's%20spike,SARS%2DCoV%2D2%20strain)). In June 2021, the Delta variant displaced Alpha to become dominant in the U.S. ( [here](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html)). As the virus adapted and mutated, variants changed the effectiveness of the vaccines, which were based on the original strains, Bradfute said, which \"bypassed some of the immunity so that the protection against the infection from the vaccines was less.\" \"However, the protection against hospitalization and death was still very strong,\" Bradfute said. \"That kind of continued with the Omicron where the vaccines were not as effective against protecting you from infection because the virus changed\" ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-stealth-covid-variant-ba2-now-dominant-globally-2022-03-29/)). CONTEXT COUNTS Early in the viral video, headlines touting 100% efficacy refer to small trials or specific outcomes. For example, in the Pfizer trial involving 2,260 adolescents aged 12 to 15, researchers calculated 100% efficacy based on 16 cases of COVID in the placebo group and none in the vaccinated group, ( [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005503/en/)). Similarly, in June 2021, a Novavax press release said its COVID-19 vaccine showed \"100% protection against moderate and severe disease,\" but only against variants that were \"not considered Variants of Concern/Interest.\" Efficacy against severe disease caused by a \"Variant of Interest\" was reported to be 93%, while efficacy in high-risk groups such as the elderly was 91% ( [here](https://ir.novavax.com/2021-06-14-Novavax-COVID-19-Vaccine-Demonstrates-90-Overall-Efficacy-and-100-Protection-Against-Moderate-and-Severe-Disease-in-PREVENT-19-Phase-3-Trial)). Seeing \"100%\" efficacy is where readers \"need to tap the brakes a little bit,\" Bradfute said, because \"there's no such thing as a vaccine that's 100% effective\" if there are enough participants in the study. He added that these results are not indicative of vaccine effectiveness for all groups of people, which can vary. \"People that are in one study, they're all young and healthy, are going to make a stronger immune response to the vaccine and probably better protection,\" Bradfute said. \"But some groups have a lot of people that are immunocompromised that are in nursing homes and older, and the efficacy probably won't be as good because their immune responses aren't as good.\" Another article excerpt highlighted in the circulating video is taken from a February 2021 story describing early real-world results as Israel began rolling out mRNA vaccines ( [here](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/real-world-trial-pfizer-covid-vaccine-finds-high-2-dose-good-1-dose)). The video highlights a section of text that reads, \"A large observational, real-world study from Israel estimates that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is 46% effective at preventing infection 14 to 20 days\" without including the fact that it was after only one dose. The video further omits key context in the next sentence of the article, which reports 92% effectiveness \"7 days after the second dose.\" Also left out is the finding that a single dose was \"74% effective against COVID-related hospitalization and 72% effective at preventing death\" ( [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765)). VERDICT Misleading. While COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness does vary over time and under different conditions, the vaccines have been demonstrated in the past to protect against infection and continue to be shown to protect against severe disease, hospitalization and death. A video of news headlines is not proof the vaccines are ineffective or a scam. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
