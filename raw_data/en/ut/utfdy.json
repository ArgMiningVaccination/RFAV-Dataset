Austin addressed the hesitancy that some service members have about getting the vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration has given all the vaccines currently being administered emergency use authorization. It is much as it sounds, according to the FDA. In an emergency, the FDA can make a product available to the public based on the best available evidence, without waiting for all the evidence that would be needed for FDA approval or clearance. COVID-19 has killed more than 500,000 Americans, and the FDA approved the vaccines to help save lives. The vaccines were intensely studied and tested on hundreds of thousands of people. The efficacy of the vaccines against COVID-19 is not in question.

He wants service members and their families to read the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and speak to defense health professionals. \"It's really important that ... people have the facts, and we found that armed with the facts, they'll make the right decisions typically,\" he said. \"I've taken the vaccine. I consider it to be safe. We've not seen very many side effects that are harmful. \"The greatest incentive to getting vaccinated is that it saves your life, and it saves the life of the folks that mean a lot to you,\" he continued. \"That, in and of itself, "}
