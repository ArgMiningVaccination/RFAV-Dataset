As a naturopathic physician, author, speaker and former professor and clinical faculty at Bastyr University for over 25 years, he has a strong focus on developing psycho-emotional-spiritual health while dealing with chronic, life-challenging illnesses and trauma. He has taught counseling, mind-body medicine and biofeedback to naturopathic medical students and graduate students in counseling and health psychology, nutrition, and acupuncture and oriental medicine, as well as spirituality and psychology courses to undergraduates in health psychology. His contemplative approach to care, which integrates his years of study medicine, mind-body medicine and biofeedback, depth & somatic psychology, yoga and movement, bodywork and end-of-life care, was profoundly shaped by his participation in a joint research study between the University of Washington and Bastyr University where he provided over 500 guided bedside meditations to hospice patients. Dr. Lichtenstein received his doctorate of naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University and is BCIA certified in general biofeedback and heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback. His chapters on mind-body medicine have been published in the Advanced Clinical Textbook of Naturopathic Medicine (2020) and in Integrative Men's Health (2014), and his articles have appeared in several publications and journals (STEP Perspective, Caregiver Quarterly, NDNR and the Huffington Post). Dr. Lichtenstein continues to facilitate in-person and online workshops for practitioners and the general public, and he speaks nationally on topics ranging from stress-reduction, mindfulness and health, mind-body approaches to healing trauma, and issues surrounding end-of-life. Finally, he has hosted over 40+ Death & Cupcakes gatherings around the greater Seattle area encouraging people to become more comfortable with the inevitable reality that faces us all. "}
