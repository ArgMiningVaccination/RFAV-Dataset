There are seven main centers of energy called chakras which feed the meridians of the body. Each of the chakras and meridians are associated with different physiological and psychological functions. When there is a disruption in the normal flow of energy in one's body, which can occur from disease or trauma, symptoms such as pain, inflammation, nausea, anxiety etc. can occur. An energy therapist is able to detect with his/her hands these places of disruption and correct these disruptions in energy. There are many different schools of energy healing, all revolving around the same principles. Some of the ones you may have heard of include Healing Touch, Reiki, and Therapeutic Touch. Most energy therapists have studied multiple types of energy healing. If you are interested in energy healing call Kauffman Chiropractic at 513-444-4529. A certified energy healer is available on site. "}
