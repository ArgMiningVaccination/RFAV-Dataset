It was originally developed by the Irish Cancer Society to support women living in disadvantaged communities who smoke and who want support to quit. This came about following reports that more women were dying of lung cancer than breast cancer 1, and that women in lower socio-economic groups had the highest rates of smoking in Ireland.2 Following the continued success and positive results of this programme, the HSE's Tobacco Free Ireland (TFI) Programme took over the coordination of We Can Quit in 2020. The We Can Quit model has since been adapted for men only groups and mixed gender groups. We Can Quit follows the standard treatment programme for smoking cessation, but takes a more holistic approach to smoking and health. It incorporates elements such as, healthy eating; physical activity; stress management and self- care; gender and health; etc. that will further support individuals on their quit smoking journey and help sustain long term quitting success. There are 3 core elements to the programme:\u00b7 Group support - facilitated and managed by 2 Community Facilitators. \u00b7 One to one support - provided by the Community Facilitators and the Community Pharmacist during pharmacy visits. \u00b7 Access to a 12 week supply of free stop smoking medication (combination NRT or combination varenicline and NRT) - facilitated by the Community Facilitators with the support of the Local Coordinator and dispensed by the Community Pharmacist The women's programme is delivered over 12 weeks but can be condensed into 11 weeks if required. The men's programme has 2 options: delivered over 7 weeks or 10 weeks. This is to cater for groups/individuals who may not wish to sign up for a course that extends beyond the standard treatment for smoking cessation (which is usually 7 weeks). The mixed gender programme is delivered over 7 weeks. 1 National Cancer Registry of Ireland.

The mixed gender programme is delivered over 7 weeks. Although, there is the option to extend this to 10 weeks. You should use the session plans from Section 5 for this purpose. The Celebration/Final Session, whether it is week 7 or 10, can be adapted from either the women's only or the men's only session plans (see sections 3 and 4 respectively).6We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Acknowledgements The HSE would like to acknowledge the work previously undertaken by the Irish Cancer Society, who originally developed, coordinated and delivered 'We Can Quit'.

Complete this task as an anonymous activity:\u00b7 Give each person 3 different coloured Post-it notes or pieces of paper - sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate between hopes and expectations. Don't dwell on this, you can class these together if you or the group prefer \u00b7 Use a different colour for each: hopes, expectations and concerns \u00b7 Ask participants to put these into a box or hat \u00b7 Alternatively, if you only have one colour Post-it note or paper, you can use 3 different boxes \u00b7 Anonymously the facilitators can read these aloud \u00b7 Allow for discussion or provide feedback as appropriate You could give an example of one of the following and say \"In other groups, they have said that they hope they will quit smoking, but a concern might be that they will feel judged for having a relapse.\" Example of possible responses: Hopes Expectations Concerns \u00b7 I will quit smoking \u00b7 I will become healthier \u00b7 I will save money \u00b7 I will get support from the group \u00b7 I won't be judged \u00b7 I will experience other health benefits\u00b7 I will make friends \u00b7 The group will be supportive \u00b7 The medication will help \u00b7 I will enjoy the course \u00b7 I will learn about the health benefits of quitting and see them in myself \u00b7 My friend did the course, and he/she said it was great\u00b7 I will fail/ I won't quit smoking \u00b7 I will let my family down \u00b7 I will let the group down \u00b7 I will be angry when I quit \u00b7 I won't be able to cope with the cravings \u00b7 I will be judged \u00b7 I won't complete the course \u00b7 I will have a bad reaction to the medication If hopes and expectations are unrealistic, ensure you address these. Likewise, try to reassure any concerns about \"failure.\" This is not a word that we use in this group. Let the group know that some people may lapse or relapse but that you and the group are here to support and guide them. In the beginning we will take one day/step at a time. Every quit attempt provides learning which you can draw upon/use for when you quit for good. Week 1 - CF Information 1TFI/PUB-515We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Group Agreement The purpose of the Group Agreement is to set the tone for the programme, and helps the group to work in a safe, enjoyable and creative way.

On a scale of 1 - 10, how ready are you to quit smoking? Not ready to quit Ready to quit On a scale of 1 - 10, how confident are you that you can quit for good? Not at all confident Very confident On a scale of 1 - 10, how important is quitting smoking to you? Not at all important Very important Each question can be followed by feedback or comments from the participants on the position they took on each question and why, as appropriate. Allow discussion on pros and cons to stop smoking using the information from the exercise. Allow participants to come up with their own methods for managing the change. This exercise can be done both with the decisional balance exercise but also at later dates, particularly if participants are nding it hard to quit or at risk of relapse.

Week 2 - CF Information 1TFI/PUB-522We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Carbon monoxide, smoking and your health What is Carbon Monoxide? \u00b7 Carbon monoxide (CO) is a highly dangerous toxic gas made of one atom of carbon and one atom of oxygen. It is not the same as carbon dioxide (CO2) which is in the air and is the gas we breathe out. \u00b7 You can't see or smell carbon monoxide. \u00b7 It is produced when carbon containing compounds like coal and fuel are burned. \u00b7 You also nd carbon monoxide when you burn any tobacco product. \u00b7 When people die from fumes in res, it is carbon monoxide (CO) that is the killer. A faulty gas boiler may also give out CO. Car exhaust contains CO. In large amounts it can kill. \u00b7 When you inhale your own tobacco smoke or that of another person, you take in carbon monoxide through your lungs. How does CO get into your body? Every time you breathe in cigarette smoke you absorb carbon monoxide (CO) through your lungs. Usually, oxygen is carried around your body by your red blood cells. When you smoke, though, CO takes some of the oxygen's place. When blood cells carry CO, they can't carry oxygen. So how does it damage my health? Carbon monoxide affects your health in three ways! 1. When inhaled, carbon monoxide binds itself to the haemoglobin (red blood cells which carry oxygen to all your cells) in your blood and prevents it from carrying enough oxygen around the body. This means the heart and other organs are starved of oxygen and have to work harder - this causes breathlessness and puts a lot of increased pressure on your heart muscles. 2. Carbon monoxide also damages the lining of the blood vessels making them more prone to a build-up of plaque (a fatty coating which can lead to high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke). 3. Carbon monoxide also makes your blood stickier so your blood is more likely to clot. How does carbon monoxide damage the health of people around me?3 Carbon monoxide in second-hand smoke is a risk. Your friend, family and pets will breathe in your smoke when you smoke around them and breathe in carbon monoxide. Week 2 - CF Information 2 (page 1 of 2)3 Adapted from: Blooming Health 2009 www.bloominghealth.co.uk TFI/PUB-523We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack The good news! When you stop smoking your CO levels return to normal very quickly (within 24 - 48 hrs). Benefits of quitting \u00b7 You feel tter \u00b7 You are less breathless \u00b7 You have better concentration \u00b7 Your blood pressure and pulse return to normal \u00b7 Your risk of heart attack begins to fall Other benets of quitting\u00b7 Better sense of taste and smell - you enjoy your food more \u00b7 Lots more money in your pocket \u00b7 Fresher breath, no smoky smell from hair and clothes \u00b7 Cheaper life insurance \u00b7 Live longer - you get to enjoy your retirement and being around for your family/grandchildren Gender Specific And if I'm pregnant? Carbon monoxide is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it reduces the supply of oxygen to an unborn baby (known as foetal hypoxia). The baby cannot grow as well as it should, particularly the brain, if there is less oxygen than ther e should be. Smoking while pregnant means:\u00b7 You are more at risk of miscarriage \u00b7 You are more likely to suffer from bleeding \u00b7 You are more likely to have a premature baby \u00b7 Your waters are more likely to break early which can cause infection \u00b7 Your baby is more likely to be stillborn \u00b7 Your baby is 3 times more likely be born underweight The best thing you can do to give your child a healthy start in life is protect yourself and your baby from tobacco smoke. Gender Specific Erectile dysfunctionCarbon monoxide reduces the supply of oxygen to the blood vessels. Men who smoke double their risk of erectile dysfunction, caused by the disruption to blood vessels in that area. Week 2 - CF Information 2 (page 2 of 2)TFI/PUB-524We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Nicotine and stop smoking medications What is Nicotine?4 Nicotine is a deadly poison - a small amount injected into the blood-stream can kill a person in less than an hour. It is highly addictive and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) it is more addictive than heroin and cocaine. What does Nicotine do? \u00b7 Nicotine is a stimulant which affects many body systems, including the brain, heart and nervous system \u00b7 When nicotine is taken into the body through smoking it is absorbed by the body very quickly, reaching the brain within 10 - 20 seconds \u00b7 It activates the reward pathways in the brain and increases levels of dopamine in the reward circuits, creating feelings of pleasure for the smoker. The acute effects of nicotine and the feelings of reward do not last more than a few minutes \u00b7 As nicotine levels fall in the body, smokers feel an urgent desire to smoke (at intervals of 20 - 45 minutes, depending on consumption rates). In order to restore these pleasurable feelings and avoid withdrawal the body sends messages to your brain which you experience as a craving for a cigarette. \u00b7 Chronic exposure to nicotine causes structural changes in the brain by de-sensitising nicotine receptors and increasing the number of them, thus increasing the urge for the next cigarette. This change in brain chemistry is permanent once someone becomes addicted and is the reason why some people can revert back to smoking for example after many years of having quit if they start smoking again, even one cigarette. What medications are available to support quitting smoking? There are a number of medications available to help relieve the withdrawal symptoms and cravings of quitting smoking and to wean your brain and body off nicotine. Some are only available on prescription (Champix and Zyban) and others are available to purchase over the counter (Nicotine Replacement Therapy). Taking any of the medications available can increase the chances of quitting and quitting permanently.It is important for participants to check with their GP or pharmacist to see which product would suit them best and its correct use. Champix/ Varenicline Varencline is the clinical name for Champix. It is a prescription only tablet that helps relieve cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking. It also reduces the enjoyment and pleasure you get from smoking by blocking the reward pathways. This may be followed by an additional 12 week course for heavily addicted tobacco users in consultation with your doctor. Those choosing to use Champix need to start taking it 7 to 14 days before their quit date.NOTE: Those opting to use Champix may have to delay their quit date for up to one week. It is vital that you arrange the one-to-one with these participants on their quit date, if it is different to the rest of the group.There are a few precautions and contraindications to taking Champix. 4 See section 7 for more information on nicotine if required. Week 2 - CF Information 3 (page 1 of 4)TFI/PUB-525We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Precautions for anyone with: \u00b7 Moderate or severe Renal (kidney) impairment - reduce dose to 1mg per day \u00b7 Epilepsy It is not recommended for:\u00b7 People under 18 years of age \u00b7 Those who are pregnant or breast feeding \u00b7 Anyone with an allergy to varenicline or any of its excipients (its vehicle or medium) Possible side effects:Less than one in ten people experience:\u00b7 Nausea - this usually resolves over time or the dose can be reduced for severe nausea \u00b7 Headaches \u00b7 Insomnia or abnormal dreams. Zyban/ Bupropion This is the rst non nicotine medication shown to be successful for smoking cessation. It is an anti-depressant and is available on prescription only from a doctor.

Precautions for elderly people and anyone with : \u00b7 Mild/moderate hepatic impairment \u00b7 Renal impairment \u00b7 Predisposing risk factors for seizures It is not recommended for those: \u00b7 With a history of seizure disorder \u00b7 Who are pregnant/breastfeeding \u00b7 In abrupt alcohol/sedative withdrawal \u00b7 With severe hepatic cirrhosis \u00b7 With a CNS tumour \u00b7 A history of bipolar disorder \u00b7 Using irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (allow 14 days)\u00b7 With a concomitant use of another bupropion containing product \u00b7 With a history of bulimia, anorexia nervosa \u00b7 With an allergy to bupropion or excipients \u00b7 People under 18 Possible side effects \u00b7 Less than one in ten patients experience insomnia \u00b7 Less common symptoms (less than one in a hundred) \u2014 Rash/ urticarial \u2014 Headache/dizziness \u2014 Fever \u2014 Gastrointestinal problems e.g., dry mouth, nausea \u00b7 Low risk of seizure - less than one in a thousand. Week 2 - CF Information 3 (page 2 of 4)TFI/PUB-526We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is a medication that will replace a small amount of nicotine, enough to take the edge off cravings and make them easier to deal with but not continue to stimulate the nicotine reward pathways in the brain. Using this medication can significantly increase your chances of success. NRT is available in a number of different products to suit different needs. Combination nicotine replacement is more effective than using one product alone. This means using a slow release product, like the patch, for a background dose of nicotine and a fast acting product like gum, inhaler, lozenge or mouth spray for breakthrough cravings. All the products are listed below: \u00b7 Nicotine patch (slow release product) \u00b7 Nicotine gum (fast acting product) \u00b7 Nicotine inhaler (fast acting product) \u00b7 Nicotine lozenge (fast acting product) \u00b7 Nicotine mouth spray (fast acting product) Nicotine patches suit those who are regular smokers through the day. They can be used for 16 or 24 hour periods. The 24 hour patch keeps the nicotine levels constant and is for those who smoke as soon as they wake up or who smoke during the night. Put the patch on a different, hairless part of the body each day so it won't irritate the skin. Some people may have skin sensitivity to the patch, if this happens try a different brand or switch to a different form of NRT. All medications should be stored safely. Nicotine gum relieves withdrawal symptoms and gives you something to do with your mouth in place of smoking. This can help change your habit of smoking. It is important to remember that nicotine gum is not chewed like regular gum. There is a special technique for releasing nicotine which involves chewing and parking the gum against the inside of the mouth. Nicotine inhaler is made up of a mouth piece and cartridges which contain nicotine. When you inhale, the nicotine and vapour is absorbed into the blood through the lining of your mouth and throat. The mouthpiece is like a pen and replaces the hand and mouth action which you use when smoking. It may suit you if you miss the routine of smoking and the pufng sensation. Nicotine lozenge comes in various strengths depending on how addicted you are to nicotine. Some people prefer the taste of lozenges over other oral forms of NRT. Nicotine is absorbed into the blood through the lining of your mouth as you suck. Lozenges may irritate your mouth and stomach and cause hiccups. Nicotine mouth spray is a fresh-tasting minty spray which provides small doses of nicotine to help manage cravings when quitting. Users should use 1-2 sprays when they would normally smoke a cigarette or have cravings to smoke. The spray will begin to work in 60 seconds and this product is one of the fastest acting products to relieve cravings, but again there is a special technique in using this successfully. Talk to your stop smoking advisor and/or pharmacist for advice. The maximum dose is 2 sprays at a time. Up to 4 sprays per hour may be used and up to 64 sprays per day. Week 2 - CF Information 3 (page 3 of 4)TFI/PUB-527We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack What is combination NRT or dual use NRT? Combination therapy provides for the use of both a xed or slow release product (patch) and a flexible (fast acting) NRT format. This combination allows the person to have a continuous base level of nicotine from the patch and also allows them to use either the gum, inhaler, lozenge or mouth spray to deal with break-through cravings e.g. during times of stress, socialising etc. Research shows that combination therapy can increase the smoking cessation rate compared to a single formulation of NRT in smokers motivated to quit. NRT can also be used in combination with Champix and has been found to be the most effective combination of stop smoking medications. Combination NRT and Champix increases the chances of quitting and staying quit by 3 \u00bd times compared to not using any form of medication. Most people do not use enough NRT or for long enough, so remember not to be afraid to use this medication for a successful outcome.

The World Health Organisation denes addiction as \"a compulsion to take a drug on a continuous basis in order to experience its psychic effects and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence.\" Smoking a cigarette is not an isolated act but is associated with emotional as well as physical dependence.To understand the complex and compulsive nature of smoking it is important to realise that three different factors play a part: \u00b7 Physical addiction to the drug nicotine \u00b7 Automatic habit which includes the handling and the ritual of opening the pack, lighting up, the sound of the paper etc. \u00b7 Psychological/emotional dependence is often used as an aid to damp down and/or control negative feelings of anxiety, frustration or anger. Physical/Chemical addiction to nicotine It takes 7 - 10 seconds for the nicotine to reach the smoker's brain once the tobacco smoke has been inhaled. People continue to smoke in order to maintain a certain level of nicotine in their blood; when it falls below that level they feel an urgent desire to smoke. This results in smokers responding to cravings at regular intervals depending on their consumption rates. Smoking and triggers Smoking can be triggered by many different activities e.g. drinking tea, coffee or alcohol; with driving; sitting in a certain chair; answering the telephone; nishing a meal; or with certain friends. Smoking often becomes an unconscious habit and a pack of 20 can be smoked without the smoker remembering many of the individual cigarettes. Psychological aspect The psychological aspect of smoking is associated with emotional dependence. Many smokers use cigarettes to provide breaks, as part of the structure of the daily routine, or when they meet up with fellow smokers. This aspect of smoking can be triggered by boredom, anger and excitement. Cigarettes can be used to cope with stress and the level of consumption may go up at these times.

When someone finds themselves in a stressful situation, meditation can be a useful tool. A simple exercise such as deep breathing and focusing on the breath for 30 seconds can help to relax the mind and body. It doesn't have to be anything more elaborate than that.

For some people coping with withdrawal symptoms is like riding a roller coaster - there may be sharp turns, slow climbs, and unexpected plunges. Most physical symptoms manifest within the first one to two days, peak within the first week, and subside within two to four weeks. Any new symptoms should be notified to a health professional, especially if severe. Recent medication changes and caffeine intake can have an impact on symptoms. It may take longer to break the psychological dependence caused by constant triggers and social cues associated with smoking. Symptom Cause Duration Relief Craving for a cigarette Nicotine is a strongly addictive drug, and withdrawal causes cravings. Urges to smoke or cravings usually reduce over time as long as you don't have a puff of a cigarette, but can appear for a long time after quitting. Wait out the urge, which lasts only a few minutes; Distract yourself; Exercise (take walks); Drink a glass of water or fruit juice; Breathe slowly and deeply; Use of a nicotine medication may help. Irritability The body's craving for nicotine can produce irritability 2 - 4 weeks Take walks; Try hot baths; Use relaxation techniques. Dizziness The body is getting extra oxygen 1 - 2 days Use extra caution; Move from sitting or lying down to standing positions slowly. Chest tightness Tightness is likely due to tension created by the body's need for nicotine or may be caused by sore muscles from coughing A few days Use relaxation techniques; Try deep breathing; Use of NRT may help. Constipation, stomach pain, gas Intestinal movement decreases for a brief period 1 - 2 weeks Drink plenty of fluids; Add fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain cereals to diet. Cough, dry throat, nasal drip The body is getting rid of mucus, which has blocked airways and restricted breathing A few days Drink plenty of fluids; Avoid additional stress. Week 4 - CF Information 1 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-539We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Symptom Cause Duration Relief Depressed mood It is normal to feel sad for a period of time after you first quit smoking. Many people have a strong urge to smoke when they feel depressed. 1 - 2 weeks Increase pleasurable activities; Talk with your clinician about changes in your mood when quitting; Get extra support from friends and family. Difficulty concentrating The body needs time to adjust to not having constant stimulation from nicotine. A few weeks Plan workload accordingly; Avoid additional stress during first few weeks. Fatigue Nicotine is a stimulant 2 - 4 weeks Take naps; Do not push yourself; Use of a nicotine medication may help. Hunger Cravings for a cigarette can be confused with hunger pangs; sensation may result from oral cravings or the desire for something in the mouth. Up to several weeks Drink water or low-calorie liquids; Be prepared with low-calorie snacks. Insomnia Nicotine affects brain wave function and influences sleep patterns; coughing and dreams about smoking are common. 2 - 4 weeks Limit caffeine intake because its effects will increase over time as you quit Adapted from Materials from the National Cancer Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health. Week 4 - CF Information 1 (page 2 of 2)TFI/PUB-540We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Understanding smoking and stress Use the information is this section to invite discussion. Many smokers believe that smoking relieves stress but in fact the opposite is true. The stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of non-smokers. Rather than act as an aid to control mood, nicotine dependency seems to increase stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal. 5 Every time you smoke your body produces adrenaline, the \"fight or flight\" hormone. This actually makes you more stressed, it raises your blood pressure and increases your heart rate. What is stress? Definition: \"Mismatch between the demands placed on us and our ability to cope with these demands\" (Irish Heart Foundation). \u00b7 The way we cope with life's demands depends on how we think, our personality and our life experiences. \u00b7 Stress is hard to measure. It can be positive in that it motivates and challenges us to get things done. But it can be negative when we feel under constant pressure and overwhelmed by too many demands. What normally causes us stress? Work, unemployment, relationships, deadlines, financial pressures, illness, moving home, changing jobs, marriage, death, holidays, quitting smoking.... Short term effects of stress - examples: Long term effects of stress - examples: \u00b7 Mind becomes alert, ready to act or react \u00b7 Dilated pupils - our pupils get bigger \u00b7 Dry mouth \u00b7 Tension in our neck and shoulders \u00b7 Breathing faster \u00b7 Heart rate increases \u00b7 Blood pressure rises \u00b7 Sweaty palms \u00b7 Feel sick - butterflies in our stomach \u00b7 Increased need to pass urine \u00b7 Constipation or diarrhoea\u00b7 Headaches \u00b7 Dizziness \u00b7 Blurred vision \u00b7 Ulcers \u00b7 Hyperventilation, palpitations \u00b7 High blood pressure \u00b7 Heart problems \u00b7 High blood sugar \u00b7 Nervous indigestion \u00b7 Disturbed sleep patterns \u00b7 Difficulty swallowing \u00b7 Neck and back problems \u00b7 Bowel disorders \u00b7 Rashes and allergies \u00b7 Sexual difficulties 5 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10540594/ Week 4 - CF Information 2 (page 1 of 3)TFI/PUB-541We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Stress and your heart Stress is thought to affect the heart by its influence on the hardening and narrowing of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart - known as coronary atherosclerosis. Coping People who cope best with stress seem to have these things in common: \u00b7 A sense of being in control of their lives \u00b7 A network of family or friends to provide social support \u00b7 Personality traits such as being flexible and hopeful. Managing Stress - what can we do? If you would normally reach for a cigarette when you feel stressed, try some of these tips:\u00b7 Be more active every day: walk, cycle, jog, swim or find something you enjoy. This releases happy hormones called endorphins \u00b7 Eat healthy foods regularly and eat a variety of foods \u00b7 Get it out: Let go! Talk to a friend, write, paint/draw a picture or shout it out. It takes more energy to keep the lid on \u00b7 Agree with somebody: life doesn't have to be a battleground \u00b7 Learn to relax: use the relaxation techniques that we practise in the sessions \u00b7 Breathing: we breathe between 16,000 and 20,000 times a day so deep breathing is useful to help us to take control \u00b7 Get enough rest and sleep: everyone needs to recharge their batteries \u00b7 If you are ill, don't try to carry on as if you are not \u00b7 Comfort zones: find a place where you can get comfort and strength - a person (partner, friend or colleague), a place (beach or park) or a routine (bath, walk or keep a diary). Enjoy it! \u00b7 Massage: This will ease the aches and pains and help you to relax and unwind \u00b7 Don't self-medicate: avoid alcohol, cannabis, tranquillisers, or too much caffeine \u00b7 Praise yourself for getting things done: Prioritise your day ahead and only do the things that you have to do - make a list if it helps. Plan ahead and learn to say \"No\" sometimes \u00b7 Delegate responsibility: a few minutes spent getting someone else to help you will be time well spent if it makes your day less hectic \u00b7 Do something for others: this can make you feel good too \u00b7 Take up a hobby or get back to one you had before \u00b7 Be realistic about what you can achieve: Forget perfection \u00b7 Learn to accept what you cannot change and change what you cannot accept \u00b7 Humour: thinking too much can be stressful. Laughter helps us to get a different view and relax. \u00b7 Treats: when you have a difficult challenge, plan to give yourself a treat afterwards - a meal with a friend, new clothes, a book, a nice bath \u00b7 Worry box: What does worrying get us? Make a worry box, take time out of each day to write down what is worrying you, put it aside until you are ready to deal with it Week 4 - CF Information 2 (page 2 of 3)TFI/PUB-542We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack \u00b7 Ask for help if you need it: Asking for help is a strength, not a weakness.

NOTE: for the men's group, you must establish whether the group would like to extend the programme from 7 to 10 weeks. Minimum of 6 participants required for this to continue or as agreed with your local coordinator. These sessions will give participants the chance to explore the issues that are most important to them in more detail. It supports the process of consensus style decision making and allows them to reach a group agreement on their choices/areas of interest for the last few weeks. Guest speakers add value to the programme and can include professional healthcare workers, past participants, representatives from community and/or health initiatives, sports and exercise organisations, or providers of a health or well-being service. Areas of interest, such as women/men and health, stress and relaxation, and healthy eating may have come up in previous sessions and this will give participants a chance to explore them in more detail. Method Step 1 Introduce the activity. Let the group know of any guest speakers that have agreed/are available to attend. Step 2 Brainstorm: Using a flip chart page, write up some of the issues or topics that have come up in previous discussions and ask participants to list any other topics they would like to add to the list. Step 3 Seek agreement from participants on the options they would like to include in the vote. Step 4 Give each participant 10 sticky dots and ask them to choose their top three choices, by placing 5 dots beside their rst preference, 3 beside their second and 2 beside their third. Step 5 When all participants have voted, the Facilitator counts the number of dots, adding up the total score for each topic.Step 6 Present the results on a flip chart, ranked in order of the highest to the lowest scores. The 3 highest scores will be offered as topics for the next sessions. Week 5 - CF Activity 1TFI/PUB-547We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Quitting smoking doesn't have to be a weighty matter The health risk of a little weight gain is nothing compared to how damaging smoking is for your health. Cigarettes act as an appetite suppressant and therefore you may feel hunger when you stop smoking. The average person puts on around 1/2 a stone or 3kg when they quit smoking. Some people may put on more, even up to 2 stone or 13kg. But you would have to gain almost 7 stone or 45kg to put the same pressure on your heart that smoking causes. Most people return to their normal (pre-smoking) weight after just one year. One reason for a little weight gain after stopping smoking is that nicotine boosts your metabolic rate. But that's not the main reason. For seven out of ten people who put on weight after quitting, the reason is simply that they consume more calories. Feelings of hunger are common, but these will go away after a few weeks. Eating lots of snacks full of sugar and fat will account for lots of extra calories. If you feel a \"snack attack\" approaching try to choose from the following low fat/low calorie options: \u00b7 Fruit - fresh or dried \u00b7 Plain popcorn \u00b7 Diet yoghurt \u00b7 Chopped carrots/peppers/celery with salsa dip\u00b7 Diluted fruit juice \u00b7 Bowl high bre cereal \u00b7 Wholemeal scone \u00b7 Plain biscuits/crackers Eating as little as 100 calories extra every day means you gain 1 pound/ 450g of fat weight in a month. That's almost a stone in a year. Here are a few ideas on how to cut out 100 calories: \u00b7 Chose tuna tinned in brine or fresh water instead of oil packed \u00b7 Add a tomato slice, lettuces leaves and pepper strips to a sandwich, instead of mayonnaise \u00b7 Switch from full fat to low fat or fat free milk \u00b7 If you like ice-cream limit it to 1 scoop instead of 2 \u00b7 Switch all your salad dressings to low fat \u00b7 Make your own smoothies with fruit. Switch from a milkshake to a smoothie with fat free milk\u00b7 Switch to sugar-free gum instead of regular \u00b7 If you're out to dinner nibble on a breadstick instead of garlic bread \u00b7 As a snack eat plain instead of custard style yoghurt \u00b7 Reduce your portions of meat - at dinner cut back from four ounces to three (cooked weight) \u00b7 Eat two pieces of fruit instead of a bar of chocolate Week 5 - CF Information 1 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-548We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Another way to cut down on 100 calories is to take more exercise. Here are a few ways to burn it off (based on an 11.5 stone/ 73kg adult).\u00b7 Cycling at 10mph for 15 minutes \u00b7 Golng for 10 minutes \u00b7 Gardening for 40 minutes\u00b7 Washing the floor for 15 minutes \u00b7 Slow walking for 20 minutes \u00b7 Moderate pace walking for 15 minutes Here are the ve things you can do to help prevent weight gain while you focus on quitting smoking:1. Have regular meals and snacks if you need them. 2. Start some regular exercise - make it fun and something you enjoy. 3. Keep a food diary for a few days before and after you quit. This can help to identify when you are over-eating. 4. Always have loads of healthy foods such as fruit around if you feel the urge to snack. 5. Use low calories desserts such as yoghurts, fruit, plain biscuits to ght that \"unnished feeling\" you may get after a meal.

It provides an alternative way of checking with participants at the beginning of the session, to create some energy, some positivity and even some honesty. It can be repeated again as part of the closing session of your group. Objective: The objective of this icebreaker activity is to encourage participants to check in with themselves about their feelings and their mood. It lets them know that it is ok not to feel great all of the time. It also reinforces the idea that we can take some control over our situation and can take action to improve our mood and our thoughts, if we are feeling negative or low. Method: Step 1 Before the session begins draw a big happy face on a flip chart and place it on one side of the room. Step 2 Next draw a big sad face on a flip chart and place it on the other side of the room.Step 3 Ask the participants to think of an imaginary line running across the room from the happy face to the sad face.Step 4 Ask the participants to \"check in\" with themselves, and how they are feeling today.Step 5 Next ask them to stand on the line at the spot that best represents how they are feeling today.Step 6 Then invite participants to share how they are feeling today and why. If nobody offers to start, pick someone from each end and the middle. Alternatively, you could stand on the line and share your reason for choosing that spot. Step 7 Repeat this exercise at the end of the session and ask participants to comment if there has been any change in the shape of the line or if they have changed their position/mood as a result of the session. See next page for option 2 Week 6 - CF Activity 1 (option 1)TFI/PUB-555We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Option 2 One positive experience Part 1 - complete this at the start of the session Ask each person to say their name and one positive experience that they have had over the past 6 weeks. Some may say that they have quit smoking, and others may say something that is related to quitting. Perhaps this is something that was unexpected or an added bonus. You could give a couple of examples to avoid everyone saying the same thing.Examples of responses: \u00b7 I have not smoked for 3 weeks \u00b7 My partner has quit smoking with me \u00b7 I have more energy now and I am thinking about taking up jogging \u00b7 I don't get out of breath as much when I am playing soccer/playing with the children, etc. \u00b7 I have saved \u20ac______ \u00b7 I have made new friends in the group \u00b7 I have learned that I am in control \u00b7 I feel stronger now, more empowered, as I didn't think before that I could do this. Example of responses for those who may not have quit or have relapsed:\u00b7 I had quit for 2 weeks, and I know I can do it again \u00b7 I have learned that I have control \u00b7 The support from the group has given me strength/belief that I can do it \u00b7 I know that I am not alone and that is comforting \u00b7 I understand myself better now and why I smoke. Now I can do something about it Part 2 - complete this at the end of the session Tell the group to think about their responses from the start of the session, and now ask them for their hopes for the future. Week 6 - CF Activity 1 (option 2)TFI/PUB-556We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Success and relapse prevention Stages of Change Model The process of change involves a number of stages: Pre- contemplation Contemplation Preparation Action Maintenance Relapse I have quit Stages of Change Model: Adapted from Prochaska and DiClemente Understanding relapse Based on the Stages of Change model, the process of change involves a number of different stages. Many people who quit smoking will stay smoke free. Some people may experience a \"slip\" when they have one or a few cigarettes. For some, this might be temporary and for others this may mean that they start to smoke again. It is important to remember that this happens to some people but not everyone. If you do have a slip or start to smoke again, there are measures you can take to help you become smoke free again. It is important to remember that you have already quit smoking so you have achieved this. Give yourself credit for what you have managed to do so far, in quitting smoking. Remember the effort that you put in and draw from the learning that you have had from doing this. Get back on track as a non-smoker as soon as possible. If you want to stop smoking, you can do it. Week 6 - CF Information 1 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-557We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Think about what caused you to slip in the rst place. What could you do differently to help you manage this situation if it happened again? You might want to think about the following: \u00b7 Your reasons to quit smoking in the rst place. Do these still apply to you or are there new ones to add? \u00b7 Challenges that you have had, which you managed to deal with and not smoke - maybe you attended a family occasion and managed not to smoke or a stressful time where you did not smoke. What did you do instead and how did you cope without needing or wanting to smoke? \u00b7 What supports have you used and found helpful? What could you look at now to support you again? Don't be worried that support services will think badly of you if you have smoked again, they will understand and support you again. \u00b7 Resources that you have from this programme. These include factsheets on \"Top 10 tips for successful quitting;\" your worksheets we do?;\" to be happy.\" \u00b7 The health or nancial benets of quitting and staying smoke free. \u00b7 Situations that are a challenging for you, such as socialising, alcohol or stress. What techniques have you learned that could help you to manage these more effectively and stay smoke free? \u00b7 Excuses you might have used to start smoking after you had quit - maybe you kept an \"emergency\" pack of cigarettes at home, just in case and just had one. Did you take a puff from a friend's cigarette saying, \"It's only one cigarette so it isn't really smoking.\" It is important to think about what \"excuses\" we try to use to justify why we smoke after quitting. We can learn from these and how to reduce our risk of future relapse and stay quit. \u00b7 How you handled situations when you first quit smoking. Maybe you planned situations in advance so that you helped yourself not to smoke. You might have made your home \"smoke free\" and asked people living in the house or visiting not to smoke. These have helped you in the past and can help you again to quit smoking and stay smoke free. \u00b7 Does going back to old habits and behaviours such as drinking tea or coffee make you feel tempted to smoke? If so, you might want to change this again for a while so that you can avoid the trigger for smoking. \u00b7 Check out www.Quit.ie for further tips and ideas to support you as you stay quit. \u00b7 Remember when you quit smoking, you are doing something that will benet you immediately and in the long term.

Week 6 - CF Activity 2 Case study 1TFI/PUB-559We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Managing relapse: Case study 2 Sonya's story \"I just felt so stressed all the time...\" Sonya is a busy lone parent with three small children under 10. Her time is spent with her two older children who are in school , and her youngest child who is not in school yet. She quit smoking as it was costing her a lot of money which she felt guilty ab out and one of her children has asthma. The child's asthma seemed to improve a little when she quit smoking and she managed to keep her home smoke free so friends and family had to smoke outside too. Using the nicotine patches helped her to quit smoking in the beginning but she stopped using them after 3 weeks as she got a rash on her arm. Sonya found family life with three small children and no partner very busy. The children were doing well at school but one of h er children was a little bit withdrawn sometimes, not talking much and hitting out when she tried to correct her. She worried abou t her daughter and tried to keep an eye on her to make sure she was ok.At night, Sonya used to sit down and watch some TV to help her relax. She would have a can and a few cigarettes to help her unwind. Now, with being quit, she still had a can and watched TV. Sonya decided to use the money she saved from not smoking to buy nice Christmas presents for the children. She was really happy that she didn't have to go to the moneylender for a loan this year. Being at home, at night, when the children were in bed, meant she could relax a little but it also made her feel quite lonely. She missed smoking as the cigarettes were like an old friend. Sonya was tempted and resisted for a few weeks. However, over time the temptation grew stronger and, seeing characters in the soaps light up, increased her longing for a smoke. She did give in a nd relapsed, smoking a full packet of cigarettes over a week. She knew these were not helping her situation or her child's asthma but what was she to do? Simon's story \"I just felt so stressed all the time...\" Simon has a very busy job which requires long hours. He had to take a pay cut last year, as the company he worked for was in financial difficulty. His wife passed away 5 years ago, and he has 3 children, 1 of whom is starting college, 1 is in secondar y school and 1 is in primary school. There are a few bills that have been mounting up for the past few months, and Simon is struggling to make ends meet. He quit smoking to help save money and he always felt guilty about smoking as his youngest child has severe asthma. The child's asthma seemed to improve a little when he quit smoking and he managed to keep his home smoke free so friends and family had to smoke outside too. Using the nicotine patches helped him to quit smoking in the beginning but he stopped using them after 3 weeks as he got a rash on his arm. Simon found family life with three children, all in different schools, and balancing work, with no partner, very busy and stres sful. The children were doing well at school but the middle child was a little bit withdrawn sometimes, not talking much and hitting out when he tried to correct her. He worried about his daughter and tried to keep an eye on her to make sure she was ok.At night, Simon used to sit down and watch some TV to help him relax.

Together with her partner, they had been quit for twelve weeks. They had promised themselves that they would put the money they saved from not smoking towards a trip away to the sun. They saved enough money and got a really good deal on the flights and headed off on their holiday. While on a night out, Amanda had a slip and smoked a cigarette. After that, in the shops, she noticed that cigarettes were much cheaper than at home. She bought a packet and smoked them during the week.They nished their holiday and went to the airport. Amanda had promised her Aunty Margaret and one of her neighbours that she would buy duty-free cigarettes for them. She couldn't help but notice that cigarettes were much cheaper in the duty-free shop. Alan's story \"I was in the duty free shop, they were so cheap...\" Alan had successfully quit smoking and was delighted with himself. Together with his partner, they had been quit for twelve weeks.

Discussion: What should Amanda/Alan do? Week 6 - CF Activity 2 case study 3TFI/PUB-562We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Managing relapse When tragedy strikes... Life can throw things at us that can change our life very dramatically. It might be: \u00b7 The diagnosis of a serious illness of someone we love, a parent, a partner, a brother or sister, a child or a friend or maybe yourself \u00b7 The death of a loved one - expected or sudden \u00b7 A traumatic incident - a robbery, car crash or assault \u00b7 Something we have witnessed where a disturbing memory stays in our head \u00b7 Loss of a job for ourselves or our loved ones \u00b7 Breakdown of a relationship or longstanding friendship Trauma in our lives can come at any time and hit us very hard. We cannot be completely prepared for these events in our lives. Yet there are some things we can do. For example, if you travel in a car, you would put your safety belt on for yourself and any children that might be with you to keep your risk of injury down in case anything were to happen - and because it's the law. If you were in a small boat, you would put your life vest on to protect you and keep you afloat in case anything were to happen. Sometimes, when people have been smoking and quit, the risk of relapsing may be greater when they are faced with a trauma like the ones above. Someone might just \"offer\" a cigarette without thinking to help \"calm you down\" or you might know someone who has a cigarette and ask them for one. This could mean your hard work to quit smoking going down the drain in a second. So, we don't want anything sad or tragic to happen in our lives, but sadly, sometimes they do. \u00b7 What can we do to help us to cope when unexpected or expected challenges come into our lives? \u00b7 What sort of situations do you think could happen in your life that could trigger a relapse? \u00b7 What techniques have you looked at to help you so far in your quit journey - to quit, to manage triggers and stress? \u00b7 What coping strategies could you suggest as a group to have \"up your sleeve\" in case anything traumatic, unexpected or expected, were to happen? These should be strategies that would help you to deal effectively with preventing relapse and staying smoke free. \u00b7 What would be your top 10 tips to deal with trauma and avoid relapse and to stay smoke free?

It is important to remind the individual/group that relapse is not a failure, it provides a valuable learning tool to use in quitting. Discussion points: \u00b7 Invite participants to share their picture, poem or song with the group, commenting on it. For the pictures ask them to talk a little about them. For the poem/song, ask about what they wrote or, if reading one, ask why they chose that one and what it means to them. \u00b7 What sort of experiences have you had during your quit smoking journey? Example: Maybe tempted to smoke; social situations a challenge; nd it hard knowing what to do with my hands; still getting cravings; saved lots of money and using it to buy a treat/holiday; I smoked one cigarette one evening; hard having a drink (alcohol) without a cigarette cause I drink at home not in a pub; bored sometimes; get stressed and really want a smoke to have some time out; family bereavement which reinforced decision to quit as health related illness. \u00b7 Can you identify your proudest moments during this time? They can be big or small, they're yours! What helped you in this situation? Example: Maybe family get-together and others were smoking. I was able to tell them I had quit smoking and they were all delighted for me, I felt great. I had to deal with a stressful situation and in the past I would have smoked, I didn't this time. Instead I phoned a friend and let off some steam. My daughter had a birthday party and I was able to use the money that I had saved from quitting smoking to buy her a lovely dress for the day. She looked lovely. Week 7 - CF Activity 1 (page 1 of 2) TFI/PUB-569We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack \u00b7 Can you identify moments when you felt a serious challenge/temptation? They can be big or small. How did you cope with the situation? Example: I was out with friends one night and had a few drinks. They were going out for a smoke. I didn't want to miss out so I went out. I was outside with them, breathing in the smoke and really wanting a cigarette. I took a puff and realised what a big mistake this was and stopped immediately or I realised that the temptation was too great and went back inside so I wouldn't smoke. \u00b7 During the rst six weeks, we looked at quitting, set quit dates and quit smoking. Along the way, we had lots of support and information. Were there particular parts of this that you have been using that you nd helpful in staying quit? Or, if any participants have relapsed, check out what they plan to do and how to go back to being smoke free. \u00b7 Based on your own learning and experience, what advice would you give to other people thinking about quitting? What worked/didn't work for you? Why do you think that was? Week 7 - CF Activity 1 (page 2 of 2) TFI/PUB-570We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Sample poems These poems are from Canada and were written by other people who quit smoking. Please read through them and see how they might compare with your quit smoking journey so far. A great add from our friend For2itis: Become non Smoker - By For2itis I sit here alone observing my ngers The crevice between which smoke used to linger Where a cig always stood proud and alive, Now exists a space, a void that thrives No yellow or smell, and occasionally burned When my lips and my hand forgot what they'd learned Now rests a space, the symbol of a ghter, One who has left behind his stash of old lighters. Like melting of ice in a purposeful thaw, I've grown into myself in a form newly raw. The best part of all, not for deliberation, Is the feeling of freedom, the soul liberation. To the top of smoke free mountain - By Violet To the top of smoke free mountain is where I want to be, Where the air is clean and crisp and clear And smoke will never be To the last day of my life I pray Smoke free I want to be So I can live and laugh and play And forever be smoke free Week 7 - CF Activity 2 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-571We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Load the Page - by Mama On the information highway East of Oshawa You can listen to your modem Buzzin' out its high pitched song You've been thinkin' bout the demon And the crave you had the night before And your thoughts still go off wandering The way they sometimes do When you're smoke free 16 weeks now Quittin' is so hard to do Don't feel like socializing You just wish the ght was through Here I am - On this site again - There I am - Load the page - Here I go - Cravin' Nic again - There I go - Load the page You walk into the coffee room Strung out from your ght You can feel the eyes upon you \"Did she make it one more night?\" You pretend it doesn't bother you You just keep your goal in sight Most times you can't hear Nic talk But other times you can It's those same old routines Break the habit!

Introduction In this session we will discuss the many roles and identities that we have as women, and the issues related to being a woman. Women are often defined by their relationships with other people or by the roles they have in everyday life: mother, grandmother, daughter, sister, housewife, etc. It is good to reflect on ourselves and think about who we are, and all the tasks that we perform. We will look at the importance of creating and valuing our own identity, our self-image and our health and well-being. Purpose: 1. To look at women's identity, the roles that they perform and how this can impact on health and well-being. 2. To highlight that their overall health and well-being is important. Being kind to yourself and practising self-care is an important part of being healthy and happy. 3. Remind the women throughout this session that self-care is important. Instructions Using either a flip chart or Participant Worksheet 20, ask the women to list all the roles that they fulfil or the duties that they perform on a daily basis. \"Think about from the moment that you wake up to the moment you go to bed.\" You can also add additional roles for the weekend, during holiday periods, or other significant times outside the regular week. You can draw an image of a woman on the flip chart or write a name. Perhaps someone in the group may be happy for you to use their name as an example. These are examples of what the women may come up with. Example: Week 8 - CF Information 1 Mother Nurse/Doctor TeacherWife/Partner Taxi Driver Cook/Chef Manager TFI/PUB-576We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Women's identity and health and well-being \u00b7 With all these expectations, it can be hard to develop a real image of ourselves - one that we are comfortable with, one which is based on our own assessment of our strengths and weaknesses \u00b7 Women still face many challenges and recognition in work, despite legislation on equality \u00b7 Women are still the main caregivers in the home and, in many cases, perform most of the domestic duties (cleaning, cooking, child minding, etc.) \u00b7 Women are often judged or valued by their appearance and in turn judge themselves in a harsh way. This has an impact on self-image and body image \u00b7 Women are expected to t an ideal image of what a woman should look like and be. Women's bodies are still used to sell many products, including cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Magazines show us how to shape up for summer or look slimmer or younger. Many women are influenced by these messages \u00b7 Comedians still make jokes about women and stereotypes such as the \"nagging\" mother-in-law. It is not hard to see why many women do not value themselves, their skills or abilities, and find it difficult to build a positive self-image. Discussion questions: 1. What are the barriers to you engaging in self-care? Sample answers:\u00b7 Too busy - I have 3 children, a husband, and a job \u00b7 I don't have the money \u00b7 I haven't really thought about it/It's not something that I am used to doing \u00b7 I have always put other people's needs ahead of my own \u00b7 I feel guilty 2. What are the benefits of practising self-care for you?Sample answers:\u00b7 I will be healthier \u00b7 I will be happier \u00b7 I can find some \"me\" time \u00b7 I could learn a new skill by doing something for myself, something that I want to do 3. What can you do to practise more self-care? Sample answers:\u00b7 Take up a hobby that I have always thought about \u00b7 Go for coffee by myself or with a friend \u00b7 Buy myself something new - that dress I saw last week \u00b7 Go to the hairdressers or beautician \u00b7 Get a massage \u00b7 Take half an hour every day to just breath and relax - meditation for example \u00b7 Go for my health screening Week 8 - CF Activity 1TFI/PUB-577We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Positive me and negative me Optional Activity Aim: to encourage women to think about how they see themselves, as opposed to how others see them. Activity: \u00b7 Going round the group, ask each woman to think of a negative word to describe herself, for example \"I am bad tempered...\" \u00b7 Going round again, ask each woman to think of a positive word to describe herself, for example \"I am helpful,\" \"I am honest\" Discussion: \u00b7 Which was easier to think of, the positive or the negative? Why? \u00b7 How did it feel to say these things out loud? \u00b7 Do the adjectives describe your own view of yourself, or other people's view of you? Week 8 - CF Activity 2TFI/PUB-578We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Women's health and smoking Smoking is the single biggest cause of cancer and preventable death among women in Ireland. The proportion of both women and men who smoke in Ireland is declining, which is encouraging. However, smoking is still a big public health issue in Ireland - one in six women (16%) in Ireland smoke (Healthy Ireland Survey, 2019).6 This can potentially have huge negative consequences for their future health. In the past, fewer women smoked but changes in society have been reflected in smoking behaviour and an increase in the number of women smoking. For example, women working, having their own income and freedom to spend it as they want. The tobacco companies have used this to promote smoking among women. Women become addicted to nicotine more quickly, can have more difculty quitting and can experience more severe withdrawal symptoms than men. Research shows that women may be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke than men. In relation to specic diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) the risk to women from smoking is higher than men. Smoking is a risk factor for developing many chronic diseases. It is the leading cause of premature death in Europe, harming nearly every organ in the body. For women who smoke, they have an increased risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and airways diseases, many different cancers, osteoporosis, reproductive health problems and various other diseases compared to non-smoking women. Smoking increases the risk of many cancers, it is the biggest modifiable risk factor for cancer in Ireland causing over 2,700 cancers in Ireland each year. 7 It increases the risk of many cancers including, mouth, head and neck cancers, lung, cervical, ovarian and stomach cancers. More women in Ireland are now dying from lung cancer than any other cancer, including breast cancer. Worryingly, the number of women getting lung cancer is rising. 8 Quitting smoking is the best way to reduce your risk of lung cancer. 1. Smoking and overall health \u00b7 Smoking increases your risk of developing cervical cancer - about twice as likely \u00b7 Smoking makes the immune system less able to fight HPV (Human Papillomavirus) infections, which puts women who smoke more at risk of developing cervical cancer \u00b7 Smoking can cause osteoporosis (brittle bones) and a higher risk of bones breaking due to low bone density \u00b7 If you are a smoker and taking the birth control pill containing oestrogen, you increase your chance of getting a heart attack, stroke, or deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg) \u00b7 Smoking increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Smoking also increases the risks for people with existing diabetes, causing damage to the blood vessels that feed the heart, brain, eyes, kidneys and peripheral nerves, speeding up complications of diabetes \u00b7 Smoking stains your teeth and fingers \u00b7 The smell lingers on your clothes, hair and breath \u00b7 Smoking is bad for your skin and complexion. 6 https://assets.gov.ie/41141/e5d6fea3a59a4720b081893e11fe299e.pdf 7 National Cancer Registry Ireland, 2020.

Week 8 - CF Information 2 (page 1 of 3)TFI/PUB-579We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack 2. Smoking and reproductive health \u00b7 Smokers reach menopause about two years earlier than non-smokers and this is an associated health risk for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis \u00b7 Smokers have been found to have lower levels of the hormone oestrogen in the body. Oestrogen is one of the main female sex hormones. It is needed for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system, including the menstrual cycle \u00b7 Infertility in smokers is higher than in non-smokers \u00b7 Smoking can also affect the success rates of fertility treatment \u00b7 Smokers can experience loss of periods (secondary amenorrhoea) more often than non-smokers \u00b7 Older women who smoke are more likely to have irregular bleeding 3. Smoking and pregnancy Smoking while pregnant means \u00b7 You are more at risk of miscarriage \u00b7 You are more likely to suffer from bleeding \u00b7 You are more likely to have a premature baby \u00b7 Your waters are more likely to break early - can cause infection \u00b7 Your baby is more likely to be stillborn \u00b7 Your baby is 3 times more likely to be born underweight \u00b7 Carbon monoxide is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it reduces the supply of oxygen to an unborn baby (known as foetal hypoxia). With less oxygen the baby cannot grow as well as it should. Protecting you and your baby from tobacco smoke is the best thing you can do to give your child a healthy start in life. The good news If you stop smoking, your fertility will improve. Ex-smokers do not seem to be any less fertile than women who have never smoked. Week 8 - CF Information 2 (page 2 of 3)TFI/PUB-580We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack 4. Second-hand smoke Second-hand smoke is a mixture of smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette and the smoke exhaled by the smoker. Non-smokers are at risk of cancer and other illnesses from breathing in either type of second-hand smoke. Some effects of second-hand smoke:\u00b7 Lung cancer and probably other cancers \u00b7 Heart disease \u00b7 Breathing/chest problems in adults and children, including triggering asthma attacks \u00b7 Children - increased risk of cot death, middle ear infections, direct and irreversible damage to the structure of the arteries \u00b7 Pregnant women have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth \u00b7 Exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of developing diabetes The good news Quitting smoking is the most important thing you can do for your health and to reduce your risk of cancer and other chronic illnesses. The day you stop smoking your body begins to recover. Refer to week 2, CF Information 2 for the health benefits of quitting smoking.Quitting smoking means you will:\u00b7 Look and feel better \u00b7 Have fresher breath and cleaner teeth, hair, skin and ngers \u00b7 Have more control of your life \u00b7 Be tter and have more energy \u00b7 Reduce your risk of illness \u00b7 Reduce the complications of existing illnesses \u00b7 Have a better quality of life \u00b7 Have more money to spend on the things you enjoy \u00b7 Be a good role model for your children or grandchildren \u00b7 Have a healthier family as they will not be exposed to second-hand smoke. Week 8 - CF Information 2 (page 3 of 3)TFI/PUB-581We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Smoking and lung cancer - know the signs and symptoms What is risk? Sometimes when we talk about illness and disease, we talk about our \"risk\" of getting it. Risk means the chance of a person or group of people getting a disease or illness. For example, if a person has a family history of heart disease, has high blood pressure and they smoke, they would have a \"higher risk\" of developing heart disease than someone who did not have any of these. This does not mean that they will develop heart disease but it does mean their risk of getting it is higher. A current smoker is 9 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked. The good news is quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk of lung cancer compared to if you were still smoking, and the longer you \"stay quit\" the lower your risk will be. But former smokers are still more than 3 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked. 9 It is very important for ex-smokers to be aware of the symptoms of illnesses like lung cancer so that they can get advice from their GP as soon as possible if they notice worrying changes to their health. Spotting the early signs of cancer and contacting your GP as soon as possible means that you have a better chance of successful treatment if you do have an illness like lung cancer. If you notice any of the following, contact your GP without delay. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer Symptoms of lung cancer can include: \u00b7 A new cough lasting for longer than 3 weeks \u00b7 A change to your 'usual' cough \u00b7 Chest infections that keep coming back \u00b7 Coughing up blood \u00b7 Chest pain or shoulder pain when you are breathing or coughing \u00b7 Shortness of breath, more than is usual for you \u00b7 Feeling very tired all the time \u00b7 Loss of appetite or weight loss that you can't explain Week 8 - CF Information 3 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-582We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Potential signs/symptoms of cancer \u00b7 Unexpected or unexplained bleeding from anywhere in your body, e.g. blood in your poo or wee, vaginal bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause \u00b7 Unexpected or unexplained bruising \u00b7 Unexplained/persistent abdominal bloating \u00b7 Persistent change in bladder or bowel habit \u00b7 Unexpected weight loss and/or loss of appetite \u00b7 Cough lasting longer than 3 weeks \u00b7 Lumps or bumps \u00b7 New, changing or bleeding mole \u00b7 Sores/ulcers in the skin or head or neck that don't heal fully. 9 Gandini S, Botteri E, Iodice S, Boniol M, Lowenfels AB, Maisonneuve P , et al. Tobacco smoking and cancer: a meta-analysis. In t J Cancer. 2008 Jan 1;122(1):155-64 Week 8 - CF Information 3 (page 2 of 2)If you notice any of these symptoms you should talk to your GP without delay. Lots of different things can cause these symptoms, so the chances are it won't be cancer. But if it is cancer, and it is picked up early, then you have a much better chance of being treated successfully. TFI/PUB-583We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Screening and women's health It is important that women attend for their screening appointments. Remind the women of the importance of these and how they can limit the risk by detecting cancer or other illnesses at an early stage. Screening is for people who are at risk of cancer, e.g. because they are in a certain age group, but DO NOT have any symptoms of cancer. The examples of screening below help find cancer at an early stage, before it has caused any symptoms. If it is found early, it is easier to treat and there is a better chance of recovery. Note: \u00b7 It is really important to know that you can still get cancer even if you are not in the age bracket for screening (e.g. women who are too young or old to be included in Cervical Check, BreastCheck or BowelScreen can still get cervical cancer, breast cancer or bowel cancer). \u00b7 People can get cancer in the time period in between screening appointments ('interval cancer'). So it is really important to talk to your GP straight away if you notice any signs/symptoms that could be cancer (e.g. breast lump; vaginal bleeding after sex/between periods/after the menopause; blood in poo, unexplained weight loss etc.), even if you recently had a normal screening test or are outside the age bracket for screening. \u00b7 Screening programmes are designed to help detect cancer at a very early stage before it has caused any symptoms, so people going for a cancer screening test usually do not have symptoms of cancer. People who have symptoms that could be cancer should talk to their GP straight away and should not wait for a screening test or be reassured by a recent normal screening test result. BreastCheck Breast screening involves having a mammogram of your breasts at a BreastCheck clinic or mobile screening unit. A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer when it is too small to see or feel. Available for women aged between 50 and 69, every 2 yearsCheck here to see if you are registered: https://www.breastcheck.ie CervicalCheck Women and people with a cervix between the age of 25 and 65 should go for regular cervical screening when it's due. \u00b7 Those aged 25 to 29, every 3 years \u00b7 Those aged 30 to 65 years old, every 5 years. You will be on the register if you are 25 years or older and have a PPS number. You can check here to see if you are registered and when your next appointment is due: www.cervicalcheck.ie Week 8 - CF Information 4 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-584We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack BowelScreen Around 2,800 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in Ireland every year. Bowel cancer is the third most common of all cancers in men. Bowel screening aims to detect signs of bowel cancer at an early stage, where there are no symptoms.It is available to men and women aged 60 to 69.If bowel cancer is found early, it's easier to treat and there's a better chance of recovery.Screening involves taking a sample of your stool (poo) at home using a home test. This test is free and the test kit is sent to you in the post. You can register online or Freephone: \u00b7 www.bowelscreen.ie \u00b7 1800 45 45 55 Always see a GP if you have any concerns or symptoms at any time. Week 8 - CF Information 4 (page 2 of 2)TFI/PUB-585We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Women's health and smoking quiz - True or false Solutions page The participants' copy is in the back of the their books, worksheet 32 1. Symptoms of lung cancer can include a new cough lasting for longer than 3 weeks; a change to my \"usual smoker's cough\" or chest infections that keep coming back. True: A current smoker is 9 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked, and ex-smokers are still more than 3 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked, 10 so it's important to know the signs and symptoms of lung cancer and talk to your GP straight away if you are worried. Symptoms of lung cancer can include a new cough lasting for more than 3 weeks, a change to your \"usual\" cough or chest infections that keep coming back. Most people with these symptoms will not have cancer, but if it is cancer you have a much better chance of being treated successfully if it is picked up early. 2. Women do not become addicted to nicotine as quickly as men. False: Women become addicted to nicotine more quickly and they have more difculty quitting and experience more severe withdrawal symptoms than men. 3. More women in Ireland die from breast cancer compared to lung cancer. False: More women in Ireland are now dying from lung cancer than any other cancer, including breast cancer. Worryingly, the number of women getting lung cancer is rising all the time, partly because smoking became more common among women in recent decades, and these women are now reaching an age where they are developing lung cancer. Women are taking up smoking at a younger age and they are smoking more. 4. Smoking is the single biggest cause of cancer and preventable death among women in Ireland. True: smoking is the single biggest cause of cancer and preventable death among women in Ireland. The good news is that, if you quit smoking, it is by far the most important thing you can do to protect yourself against cancer. 5. Smoking only causes cancer, heart disease and early death. False: Smoking affects your health in many other ways. It can affect your fertility; during pregnancy it can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth and a low birth weight for your baby. If you are on the combined oral contraceptive pill (birth control), you increase your chance of getting a heart attack, stroke, or deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg). Smoking increases your risk of developing cervical cancer. Smokers miss their periods more often (secondary amenorrhoea) than non-smokers. Older women are more likely to have irregular bleeding. Smokers reach menopause about two years earlier than non-smokers and this is an associated health risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. 10 Gandini S, Botteri E, Iodice S, Boniol M, Lowenfels AB, Maisonneuve P , et al.

TFI/PUB-589We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Persistence and quitting smoking A story of persistence A man in California was told that there was a diamond vein under his farm. So he went off and bought a huge mining drill. He drilled for days and weeks and months. He got nothing but rubble. Then, one morning, he decided he had enough and gave up. A lost cause. So he sold the farm and went off to make his fortune some other way. The farmer who bought the land was a bit of a handyman. He managed to get the mining drill working again. After a short time drilling, he hit the diamond vein. He made his fortune. Meanwhile, the previous owner heard about the new man's good fortune and he also made a fortune. How?By going around the country telling people that just when people are about to make a breakthrough, they give up. So near and yet so far. He became the guru of persistence - keep on trying and trying and do not give up. Quitting success So many people give up just when they are within inches of their tipping point. This is the magic moment when an idea or a new habit seems to take hold and spreads like wildre. You have put huge effort into preparing to quit and quitting smoking. Maybe, when you are just about to make a big breakthrough in making this a lifelong change, you give up. You are back down the slippery slope. When you make a big change in your life, like quitting smoking, your motivation will change over time, like waves hitting the shore. Sometimes you will feel motivated, sometimes you won't. But it's not your motivation that will produce results - it's your action. If you feel that your motivation is down, think back to the goals you set and the reasons you wanted to quit. Be inspired by your success to date and how much healthier you are; how good being smoke free feels; or the money you have saved. Adapted from: Pave your way to success with sheer persistence - Declan Coyle in Independent Newspaper declan@ andec.ie (permission sought). Week 11 - CF Activity 1TFI/PUB-590We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Motivation \u00b7 Quitting smoking may not be easy and life can get in the way. Find strategies that work for you to help you in your quit smoking journey. Try to identify a feeling that you will experience when you achieve your goal of one day, one week, one month quit. For example \"At one month quit, I want to feel strong, condent and proud of myself.\" Maybe write this up and put it up on the wall to remind yourself of your goal. It's very powerful to imagine feeling an emotion. \u00b7 Why not try writing a journal or recording your quit smoking journey? It can be helpful to record things as though you are talking to a friend and you can read back your entries when you need some extra motivation. For example \"I was at a family gathering today and there were some people smoking. I found some non-smokers to chat with. I talked about how well I was getting on and they were very supportive and encouraging.\" \u00b7 Think about the money that you will have when you have quit smoking for one week, one month, six months or one year. Think of something you said you would like or like to do, if you only had the money. It might be paying off a debt, buying a treat, getting swimming lessons or heading off on a holiday. Focus your attention on this and maybe put a picture up on a wall near a money box where you keep the money you save from not smoking. \u00b7 Think about how quitting smoking is an investment in you - your health, your well-being, your money. Think of the opportunities that will come your way as you quit smoking: starting a new sport or activity; having more energy to do the things you love; having money to treat yourself; etc. \u00b7 \"Get online\"! If you are someone who likes technology, this will be an easy one. Get on the Quit Facebook page, Instragram or Twitter, and hear about other people's quitting success and how they manage challenges and celebrate their achievements. It can be a great source of extra support. If you are not very good with technology, you might think about learning a new skill in computers. Keep your hands busy Maybe there is a job at home that you have been putting off for some time, like clearing out a drawer full of bits and bobs or a kitchen cupboard. Sorting it out will not only keep your hands and mind busy but also help you to change the spaces in your home. You might even nd something that you forgot you had or were looking for.

Adapt and add to the information below so that it applies specifically to your group.On week 1, some of you were nervous, some of you were excited but, most importantly, you all made the decision to come here. That was the start of your journey and you should be proud of yourself for making that really important and, for some, difficult decision. We spoke about the importance of abrupt cessation and the 'not a puff' rule, which I know some of you were unsure about. But you listened to the evidence and the reasons why we recommend this method, and you accepted it and progressed with it. As a group, we set the quit date for ..... We learned about the benefits of quitting smoking...(List some of them here, not forgetting the financial as well as the health benefits). For some/all of you, you are already reaping some of these benefits...(If appropriate you can mention some of the stories/successes from the group).Some/all of you have kept a weekly record of your progress and you should be proud to look back on this and see how far you have come. You have also recorded your CO readings. I know that this has been a real motivator for you each week, seeing your CO levels drop in those first few weeks, and then maintaining the CO levels each week. Now on week 7, most/all of you are 4 weeks quit. Did you know that if you quit for 28 days, you are 5 times more likely to stay quit for good. You are well on your way to living a smoke free life. Remember, \"not a puff.\" You can ask the group if there is anything that they would like to add.

TFI/PUB-5103We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Expectations we have of men Introduction In this session we will discuss the roles that men are expected to play and the traits they are expected to exhibit, and how this may impact our health. Men are often expected to behave or react in certain ways. We will look at the importance of creating and valuing our own identity, our self-image and our health and well-being. Purpose: 1. To look at men's identity, the roles they perform, and how this can impact on health and well-being. 2. To highlight how some messages we pick up about being a man may be unhelpful for supporting health and well-being. They may also act as a barrier to changing health behaviours or accessing services. 3. To highlight that their overall health and well-being is important. Looking after yourself is not a sign of weakness but is important for you and the people around you. 4. Remind the men throughout this session that self-care is important. Instructions Using either a flip chart or Participant Worksheet 21, ask the men to list the traits, roles or responsibilities that are often expected of them. You can draw an image of a man on the flip chart or write a name. Perhaps someone in the group may be happy for you to use their name as an example. These are examples of what the men may come up with. Example: Ask the participants to finish the sentence: \"The way I was brought up, boys and men were expected to.......\" Strong Main Provider/ Bread Winner Big Brother FatherDoesn't Cry Macho/masculine Risk Taker Messer/Joker Week 8 - CF Activity 1TFI/PUB-5104We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Men's identity and health and well-being With all these expectations, it can be hard to develop a real image of ourselves - one that we are comfortable with, one which is based on our own assessment of our strengths and weaknesses. \u00b7 Men may believe that they should be the main breadwinners in the home \u00b7 There are lower rates among men for help seeking behaviours, i.e. asking for help, attending their GP or other health professionals \u00b7 Explanations for these lower rates of help seeking behaviours among males include masculine norms, attitudes and behaviour, perception of the severity of the health problem, engagement in risky behaviours, and lack of health-related knowledge. 12 Use the questions below to have a discussion about how expectations of being a man can impact on their health. 1. How did these expectations have an impact on the decisions that you have made about your health and your health behaviours, such as smoking?Sample answers/prompts:\u00b7 All my friends were smoking, and I felt like I also had to start \u00b7 I won't go to my GP as I don't want to seem weak \u00b7 I don't speak to my partner/friends about my problems \u00b7 It doesn't seem important right now as I have too many other things to think about \u00b7 I am worried about the outcomes and would prefer to just ignore it 2. What impact could this have/has this had on your health?Sample answers/prompts:\u00b7 I could get a late diagnosis for something that is treatable if detected early \u00b7 The problem will never sort itself out - it will only get worse \u00b7 I have wanted to quit smoking for a long time but I was afraid of failure and so I never tried before now 3. What could society do to ensure that you and/or other men have more positive health outcomes? Follow up this questions with: And is there anything you can do for yourself? Sample answers/prompts: \u00b7 Change in cultural norms or expectations \u00b7 Advertising \u00b7 Supports available for men and appropriate signposting to these supports \u00b7 Continue on my quit smoking journey - 'not a puff' rule \u00b7 Talk to someone - it's ok to admit that you have a problem \u00b7 Take half an hour every day to just breathe and relax - meditation for example \u00b7 Go to my GP for a health screening or if I have a pain \u00b7 Ask for help At the end of the discussion, point participants to the home exercise \"Men's health, changing roles.\" This is an optional activity for them to complete, at home, in their own time. 12 Dr. Paula Devine and Dr. Erin Daly; \"Men's Health in Numbers, Trends on the island of Ireland,\" December 2020. Men's Health Forum in Ireland Week 8 - CF Information 1TFI/PUB-5105We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Men's health and smoking Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland with almost 6,000 smokers dying each year from tobacco related diseases. It is a risk factor for developing many chronic diseases and is the leading cause of premature death in Europe, harming nearly every organ in the body. Men who smoke are at an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory diseases, stroke, and diabetes. In Ireland more men smoke than women, and they begin smoking at a younger age. In 2019, there was a smoking prevalence of 17% for the overall population (Healthy Ireland Survey 2019). However, when separated by gender, 19% of men smoked compared to 16% of women. (For up to date figures on smoking prevalence in Ireland check out the latest Healthy Ireland survey). Smoking and Cancer Smoking increases the risk of cancer, and it is the biggest modifiable risk factor for cancer in Ireland causing over 2,700 cancers in Ireland each year. 13 It increases the risk of many cancers including mouth, head and neck cancers, lung, cervical, ovarian and stomach cancers. 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking. Quitting smoking is the best way to reduce your risk of lung cancer. Smoking and overall health \u00b7 Smoking can cause or worsen serious respiratory conditions, such as bronchitis and emphysema. Severe emphysema causes breathlessness, which can be made worse by infections \u00b7 Smokers are more likely to have a stroke (blockage of blood to the brain or bleed in the brain) than non-smokers. Strokes are a major cause of death and prolonged disability \u00b7 Smoking increases your risk of heart disease \u00b7 Smoking causes 90% of lung cancers \u00b7 Smoking can cause osteoporosis (brittle bones) and a higher risk of bones breaking due to low bone density \u00b7 Smoking increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Smoking also increases the risks for people with existing diabetes, causing damage to the blood vessels that feed the heart, brain, eyes, kidneys and peripheral nerves, speeding up complications of diabetes \u00b7 Infertility in smokers is higher than in non-smokers for both men and women \u00b7 Smoking doubles the risk of impotence in male smokers aged 40 to 69 compared to non-smokers Second-hand smoke Second-hand smoke is a mixture of smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette and the smoke exhaled by the smoker. Non-smokers are at risk of cancer and other illnesses from breathing in either type of second-hand smoke. 13 National Cancer Registry Ireland, 2020. Modifiable risk factors and cancer in Ireland. Week 8 - CF Information 2 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-5106We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Some effects of second-hand smoke: \u00b7 Lung cancer and probably other cancers \u00b7 Heart disease \u00b7 Breathing/chest problems in adults and children, including triggering asthma attacks \u00b7 Children - increased risk of cot death, middle ear infections, direct and irreversible damage to the structure of the arteries \u00b7 If your female partner smokes while pregnant there is an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth \u00b7 Exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of developing diabetes Other concerns for smoking \u00b7 The smell lingers on your clothes, hair and breath \u00b7 Smoking is bad for your skin and complexion \u00b7 Smoking stains your teeth and fingers. The good news Quitting smoking is the most important thing you can do for your health and to reduce your risk of cancer and other chronic illnesses. The day you stop smoking your body begins to recover. Refer to week 2, CF Information 2 for the health benefits of quitting smoking. More good news... Quitting smoking means you will:\u00b7 Look and feel better \u00b7 Have fresher breath and cleaner teeth, hair, skin and ngers \u00b7 Have more control of your life \u00b7 Be tter and have more energy \u00b7 Reduce your risk of illness \u00b7 Reduce the complications of existing illnesses \u00b7 Have a better quality of life \u00b7 Have more money to spend on the things you enjoy \u00b7 Be a good role model for your children or grandchildren \u00b7 Have a healthier family as they will not be exposed to second-hand smoke. Week 8 - CF Information 2 (page 2 of 2)TFI/PUB-5107We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Smoking and lung cancer - know the signs and symptoms What is risk? Sometimes when we talk about illness and disease, we talk about our \"risk\" of getting it. Risk means the chance of a person or group of people getting a disease or illness. For example, if a person has a family history of heart disease, has high blood pressure and they smoke, they would have a \"higher risk\" of developing heart disease than someone who did not have any of these. This does not mean that they will develop heart disease but it does mean their risk of getting it is higher. A current smoker is 9 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked. The good news is quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk of lung cancer compared to if you were still smoking, and the longer you 'stay quit' the lower your risk will be. But former smokers are still more than 3 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked. 14 It is very important for ex-smokers to be aware of the symptoms of illnesses like lung cancer so that they can get advice from their GP as soon as possible if they notice worrying changes to their health. Spotting the early signs of cancer and contacting your GP as soon as possible means that you have a better chance of successful treatment if you do have an illness like lung cancer. If you notice any of the following, contact your GP without delay. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer Symptoms of lung cancer can include: \u00b7 A new cough lasting for longer than 3 weeks \u00b7 A change to your 'usual' cough \u00b7 Chest infections that keep coming back \u00b7 Coughing up blood \u00b7 Chest pain or shoulder pain when you are breathing or coughing \u00b7 Shortness of breath, more than is usual for you \u00b7 Feeling very tired all the time \u00b7 Loss of appetite or weight loss that you can't explain Week 8 - CF Information 3 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-5108We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Potential signs/symptoms of cancer: \u00b7 Unexpected or unexplained bleeding from anywhere in your body, e.g. blood in your poo or wee, vaginal bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause \u00b7 Unexpected or unexplained bruising \u00b7 Unexplained/persistent abdominal bloating \u00b7 Persistent change in bladder or bowel habit \u00b7 Unexpected weight loss and/or loss of appetite \u00b7 Cough lasting longer than 3 weeks \u00b7 Lumps or bumps \u00b7 New, changing or bleeding mole \u00b7 Sores/ulcers in the skin or head and neck that don't heal fully. 14 Gandini S, Botteri E, Iodice S, Boniol M, Lowenfels AB, Maisonneuve P , et al. Tobacco smoking and cancer: a meta-analysis. I nt J Cancer. 2008 Jan 1;122(1):155-64If you notice any of these symptoms you should talk to your GP without delay. Lots of different things can cause these symptoms, so the chances are it won't be cancer. But if it is cancer, and it is picked up early, then you have a much better chance of being treated successfully. Week 8 - CF Information 3 (page 2 of 2)TFI/PUB-5109We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Cancer screening and men's health Screening is for people who are at risk of cancer, e.g. because they are in a certain age group, but DO NOT have any symptoms of cancer. The example of screening below, helps to find bowel cancer at an early stage, before it has caused any symptoms. If it is found early it is easier to treat and there is a better chance of recovery. Note: \u00b7 It is really important to know that you can still get cancer even if you are not in the age bracket for screening (e.g. men who are too young or old to be included in BowelScreen can still get bowel cancer). \u00b7 People can get cancer in the time period in between screening appointments ('interval cancer'). So it is really important to talk to your GP straight away if you notice any signs/symptoms that could be cancer (e.g. blood in poo, unexplained weight loss etc.), even if you recently had a normal screening test or are outside the age bracket for screening. \u00b7 Screening programmes are designed to help detect cancer at a very early stage before it has caused any symptoms, so people going for a cancer screening test usually do not have symptoms of cancer. People who have symptoms that could be cancer should talk to their GP straight away and should not wait for a screening test or be reassured by a recent normal screening test result. BowelScreen Around 2,800 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in Ireland every year. Bowel cancer is the third most common of all cancers in men. Bowel screening aims to detect signs of bowel cancer at an early stage, where there are no symptoms.It is available to men and women aged 60 to 69.If bowel cancer is found early it's easier to treat and there's a better chance of recovery.Screening involves taking a sample of your stool (poo) at home using a home test. This test is free and the test kit is sent to you in the post. You can register online or Freephone: \u00b7 www.bowelscreen.ie \u00b7 1800 45 45 55 Always see a GP if you have any concerns or symptoms at any time. Week 8 - CF Information 4TFI/PUB-5110We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Men's health and smoking quiz - True or false Solutions page. The participants' copy is in the back of their books, worksheet 33 1. Symptoms of lung cancer can include a new cough lasting for longer than 3 weeks; a change to my \"usual smoker's cough\" or chest infections that keep coming back. True: A current smoker is 9 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked, and ex-smokers are still more than 3 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to someone who has never smoked, 15 so it's important to know the signs and symptoms of lung cancer and talk to your GP straight away if you are worried. Symptoms of lung cancer can include a new cough lasting for more than 3 weeks, a change to your \"usual\" cough or chest infections that keep coming back. Most people with these symptoms will not have cancer, but if it is cancer you have a much better chance of being treated successfully if it is picked up early. 2. Smoking is the single biggest cause of cancer and preventable death in Ireland. True: smoking is the single biggest cause of cancer and preventable death in Ireland, accounting for approximately 6,000 deaths a year. The good news is that, if you quit smoking, it is by far the most important thing you can do to protect yourself against cancer and other chronic illnesses. 3. Smoking only causes cancer, heart disease and early death. False: Smoking affects your health in many other ways. It doubles your risk of impotence compared to a non-smoker. Smoking increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 4. Smoking causes approximately 90% of all lung cancers. True: Smoking causes about 9 in every 10 lung cancers. The risk increases with the amount of time you have smoked, the number of cigarettes you have smoked and if you started young. 5. Smoking can cause osteoporosis (brittle bones) and can increase the risk of breaks and falls. True: Smoking can cause osteoporosis (brittle bones) and a higher risk of bones breaking due to low bone density. 6. Smoking does not have any impact on impotence. False: Smoking doubles your risk of impotence compared to non-smokers. 7. Inhalation of tobacco smoke by non-smokers - 'passive smoking' - can also cause cancer.True: Non-smokers are at risk of cancer and other illnesses from breathing second-hand smoke. 8. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk of lung cancer and other chronic illnesses. True: It is never too late to quit smoking but the longer you stay quit, the greater your chances. As soon as you stop smoking your body starts to recover. Risk of heart attack falls to the same as someone who has never smoked. Risk of lung cancer falls to half that of a non-smoker and will continue to decrease to almost that of a non-smoker over time. Risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, bladder, cervix and pancreas decreases. 15 Gandini S, Botteri E, Iodice S, Boniol M, Lowenfels AB, Maisonneuve P , et al.

Less men than women smoke. False: More men smoke than women. They begin smoking at a younger age, and have a longer lifetime exposure to smoking than women. 10. One third of all cancers are caused by smoking. True: Smoking is associated with a number of cancers. More men in Ireland die from lung cancer than any other cancer but it goes much further than that. Cancers of the mouth, throat, larynx, kidney, oesophagus, stomach and bowel are also heavily linked with smoking.

It is used to celebrate, commiserate and to socialise. Used sensibly alcohol is a pleasurable, socially acceptable drug. Alcohol is a depressant drug. If you're feeling down, it will make you feel worse. A regular, long term drinking habit can lead to physical as well as psychological dependency. Drinking alcohol while quitting smoking may increase the risk of relapse as your resolve weakens. It is important to consider this when thinking about having a drink. If you drink and smoke, your risk of cancer is also increased. Is there a safe amount to drink? There is no \"safe\" level of alcohol drinking, but the risk of cancer and other chronic illnesses is lower the less alcohol you drink. You can limit your risk by drinking no more than one standard drink a day if you are a woman and two standard drinks per day if you are a man. What is a standard drink? In Ireland a standard drink has about 10 grams of pure alcohol in it. In the UK a standard drink, also called a unit of alcohol, has about 8 grams of pure alcohol. Here are some examples of a standard drink\u00b7 A pub measure of spirits (35.5ml) \u00b7 A small glass of wine (12.5% volume) - a bottle of wine contains about 7 standard drinks \u00b7 A half pint of normal beer \u00b7 An alcopop (275ml bottle) What are the low-risk weekly alcohol guidelines? The HSE's low risk weekly guidelines for adults are less than:16 \u00b7 11 standard drinks for women \u00b7 17 standard drinks for men \u00b7 Drink should be spread out across the week \u00b7 Have 2 to 3 alcohol free days per week \u00b7 Drink no more than 6 standard drinks on any one occasion. The less you drink the lower the risk of developing alcohol related health issues.Sticking to the limit is not safe if you drink your weekly allowance in one session, or over a couple of nights. Drinking like this is the most harmful way of drinking for your health. You're also more likely to lose control, have accidents and take risks. Remember: drinks measures are not always the same. What you get in a pub and what you pour for yourself could be very different. 16 https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/alcohol/improve-your-health/weekly-low-risk-alcohol-guidelines.html Staying Quit 1 - CF Information 1 (page 1 of 4)TFI/PUB-5118We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Alcohol and pregnancy \u00b7 There is no known safe level of alcohol use in pregnancy - so stopping completely is best; \u00b7 It is in a child's best interests for a pregnant woman not to drink alcohol while pregnant due to the risk of developmental brain disorders to the child. Alcohol findings among men In 2012 the National Advisory Committee on Drugs reported that among current drinkers aged 18-24 years, 82% of males scored positive for harmful drinking. It also highlighted that one in five drinkers reported that they had experienced harm (such as harm to health, work, friendships, or being involved in a fight or incident) in the previous 12 months as a result of their drinking. What is binge drinking? Binge drinking is a term used to describe an occasion when we drink too much. It is defined by health experts, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), as having six or more standard drinks in one session. This is the equivalent of three or more pints of beer or six or more pub measures of spirits. Binge drinking is a form of harmful drinking that is likely to increase our risk of accidents, injuries, violence and poisoning. How long do the effects of drinking last? In general you start to feel the effects of alcohol within 5 or 10 minutes of drinking. It then takes about one hour for every standard drink you take to work through your system. Alcohol and weight Alcohol is high in calories. There are around 600 calories in a bottle of wine which is the same as two bars of chocolate.

Staying Quit 2 - CF Activity 1TFI/PUB-5127We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Smoke free initiatives in Ireland Introduction to the tobacco ban in Ireland Smoking in workplaces in Ireland was banned on 29 March 2004. Ireland was the rst country in the world to have an outright ban on smoking in workplaces, with nes of up to \u20ac3,000 on the spot. Premises must display a sign to inform patrons of the ban. Ireland also banned in-store tobacco advertising and displays of tobacco products at retail outlets and a ban on the sale of packets of 10 cigarettes in the second half of 2009. The same bill also started new controls on tobacco vending machines. Since the ban a number of additional pieces of legislation have been introduced and enacted:\u00b7 2009: A ban on in-store tobacco advertising and displays of tobacco products at retail outlets and a ban on the sale of packets of 10 cigarettes. \u00b7 2013: Graphic warnings on tobacco packaging displaying health warnings, such as \"Smoking Kills.\" They must cover at least 30% on the front and 40% on the back of the packaging. \u00b7 2016: Ban on smoking in a car with a child. \u00b7 2017: Plain cigarette packaging was introduced. The Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) 19 was signed into Irish law in 2016. The TPD came from the European Union and it lays out laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products. Here are some of the regulations laid out in the TPD: \u00b7 A ban on cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterising flavours such as fruit flavours, menthol or vanilla \u00b7 Minimum unit pack size of 30g for Roll-Your-Own tobacco (rollies) \u00b7 A ban on tobacco products containing certain additives \u00b7 A ban on any misleading labelling (such as \"natural\" or \"organic\") The TPD also includes regulations on e-cigarettes which include: \u00b7 Ensure that e-cigarettes containers and refills are child-proof \u00b7 They must deliver nicotine doses at consistent levels \u00b7 The containers must meet safety and health standards, e.g. they do not break or leak during use and refill \u00b7 They must include appropriate health warnings and should not include any misleading elements or features. 19 For more information and the full list of regulations on the TPD see: https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/tobaccoproductdirective/ Staying Quit 2 - CF Information 1 (page 1 of 2)TFI/PUB-5128We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Smoke Free Homes A smoke free home is one where nobody smokes inside the home. This is an initiative to protect the health of the family from exposure to second hand smoke. It also helps to de-normalise smoking within the home and the family. For someone quitting smoking, creating a smoke free home will offer great support. HSE Tobacco Free Campus20 In order to implement national policy objectives contained in Healthy Ireland and Tobacco Free Ireland, the HSE has adopted an official corporate Tobacco Free Campus Policy. The policy has 2 clear aims: \u00b7 To treat tobacco as a healthcare issue. \u00b7 To de-normalise tobacco use in all healthcare services and settings. Tobacco Free Playground21 The first smoke free playground was introduced in Donegal in 2010. Since then, ASH Ireland, the leading anti-tobacco advocacy organisation in Ireland, has contacted county and city councils throughout Ireland encouraging them to voluntarily introduce smoke free playgrounds. There has been a very positive response with most now having smoke free signage in place. There are 2 main aims of the tobacco free playgrounds:\u00b7 To help protect children from exposure to second-hand smoke and \u00b7 To de-normalise tobacco use to future generations. 20 https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/campus/ 21 For more information see: https://ash.ie/ash-campaigns/smoke-free-playgrounds/ Staying Quit 2 - CF Information 1 (page 2 of 2)TFI/PUB-5129We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Adults - help keep your children and young people smoke free The Tobacco Industry The tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 young people to start smoking per day to replace those who have quit or die. 1 in 2 smokers will die of a tobacco related illness and the tobacco industry needs to replace these consumers in order to maintain their sales and profits. Publicly, the tobacco industry says it does not use advertising targeted at young people. However, documents from the tobacco industry, that once were condential and are now public, reveal that they see recruitment of under 18s to smoking as essential. Some quotes from the tobacco industry:\u00b7 \"Younger adults are the only sources of replacement smokers\" - RJ Reynolds, 1984 \u00b7 \"Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers rst begin to smoke while still in their teens... The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris.\" - Philip Morris 1981 \u00b7 \"The ability to attract new smokers and develop them into a young adult franchise is key to brand development.\" - 1999 Philip Morris report \u00b7 \"They got lips? We want them.\" - Reply of an RJ Reynolds representative when asked the age of the kids they were targeting. Know the facts about tobacco and young people Children and young people who use tobacco may: \u00b7 Cough and develop breathing problems leading to more sick days, more visits to the doctor and poorer results in school and in sport \u00b7 If they have asthma have attacks more often \u00b7 Be more likely to use alcohol and other drugs such as marijuana \u00b7 Become addicted to tobacco and nd it really difcult to quit. Take a stand at home - early and often \u00b7 Despite the impact of movies, music, television and other social media, parents can be the greatest influence in the lives of their children \u00b7 Talk directly to children about the risks of smoking; if friends or relations died from tobacco-related illness, let your children know \u00b7 If you use tobacco, you can still make a difference. Your best move is to quit. Don't use tobacco when your children are around. Do not offer it to them and don't leave it where they can easily get it \u00b7 Talk to them about tobacco use at age 5 or 6 and keep on talking to them about it as they get older. Many children start using tobacco before they become teenagers and become addicted. \u00b7 Know if any friends of your children use tobacco. Talk about ways to refuse tobacco \u00b7 Discuss with your children how smoking is presented in the media, such as movies and TV, and how the way it is presented as glamorous is false.

It is necessary for normal healthy everyday living. Very often stress is not so much the external environment but our internal response to that environment - how we mentally react to it.Stress develops in 3 stages:1. Alarm stage: a normal physical and mental response to stress causing situations. Sometimes referred to as \"fight or flight.\" It is characterised by anxiety, fear or anger. 2. Resistance stage: If stress is not resolved at the \"alarm stage\" you move into this stage. This stage is characterised by denial of feelings, emotional isolation and a narrowing of interests. 3. Exhaustion stage: This advanced stage is characterised by a loss of self-confidence, poor sleep habits and physical problems. Generally someone can be said to be suffering from stress when outside pressures get beyond their ability to cope. These are usually things like work pressure, bad health, family problems, money worries, etc. People who suffer from stress are much more likely to have health problems, both physical and emotional.Stress is nothing new. Life has always been a stress- making business. Modern life, however, gets more and more complicated. There is some evidence to suggest that the people most likely to suffer from stress have similar personality traits. They tend to be negative, perfectionists, people with low tolerance levels, worriers, are inclined to be intense, and can be impatient. When identifying stress in ourselves, we often see the \"big stresses.\" We tend to forget the smaller more subtle stresses, and it is very often these that add up day after day, which affect our health. 24 Adapted from Western Health Board, 2004, Well-being through groupwork: A manual for facilitators who are promoting health. Staying Quit 4 - CF Information 1TFI/PUB-5141We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Identifying and dealing with stress Having discussed what stress is, you want the group to identify what causes them stress and how it manifests itself. Task 1 - identifying stress Divide the group into smaller groups (3 or 4 people). Ask the groups to identify how they experience stress in their body, e.g. headache, vomiting, sleeplessness, etc. One person in each group writes the responses on separate Post-it notes.Make a collage of responses - you could draw a body on some flipchart paper and place the Post-it notes on the part of the body that is affected. Allow the group time to read all the responses and make comments. Task 2 - what causes me stress? Ask the group to identify what causes them stress. This can be done in one large group or go back to the smaller groups. Allow the participants to call out answers and write on flipchart paper or on Post-it notes in smaller groups - share with the larger group when done. Now ask each person to choose one of the things that causes them stress. They can keep this to themselves for now, and we will look again at it in a few minutes. Task 3 - dealing with stress Brainstorm ways of dealing with stress. This can be done in the smaller groups or the larger group. Write on flipchart or Post-it notes as appropriate. Allow whole group discussion. Now, from the earlier activity, ask everyone to remember that one thing that causes them stress. Ask each person to:1. Choose one way of coping with this stressful situation - allow the group to discuss in larger or smaller groups. 2. Identify and plan for the coming week - what are you going to do if this stressful situation presents itself to you this week? Participants can refer back to week 4 and the strategies that you had looked at for coping with stress, Participant Information 7.

Keep time for yourself \u00b7 Your home: you can often reduce stress by changing and improving your environment. Being well organised can reduce stress. Re-arranging living arrangements, changing habits, even simple storage crates for items that always seem to be on the floor can help \u00b7 Take control - no one makes us stressed, we choose to respond the way we do. Have a good laugh everyday Take it one day at a time. 25 Adapted from Western Health Board, 2004, Well-being through groupwork: A manual for facilitators who are promoting health. Staying Quit 4 - CF Information 2TFI/PUB-5143We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack SECTION 6 Additional activities The activities in the following section are optional/additional activities. They can be used to start a discussion, add to a There are participant versions in the Participant Book in the Additional Activities and Information section at the back. The copies in this pack are only for the Community Facilitator, as they contain answers and explanations of the activities. TFI/PUB-5144We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Relaxation Exercises The exercises below can be used as 5-10 minutes relaxations during the weekly sessions. They are a valuable tool in supporting people in becoming aware of their own body and mind. This will support them as they quit and help them to remain smoke free. These exercises have been borrowed with permission from Mindfulness on the go: Peace in your pocket, written by Padraig O'Morain. For more information see the book or log on to http://www.padraigomorain.com . This website also has audio pieces which you can use during the sessions or the participants can use at home. Quick body scan Practice: become aware of your body, moving your awareness from the top of your head to your toes.Commentary: in this practice you use your body to help you to be mindful. The body scan is a valuable practice, both in helping you to notice where you are tense and in helping you to relax that tension. Imagine the flow of awareness moving from your head to your toes, almost as though you're under a shower of awareness. If you want to go deeper: if you notice any tension, imagine that you're breathing into it and then move on.After you have completed the quick body scan, remain at rest for a few moments before you go on with whatever you're doing. Mindful walking Practice: being aware of the sounds of your feet on the ground, and the noises and colours around you. Activity: tell the group that they can chose to walk outside or indoors. If walking indoors they can take off their shoes. The purpose is to walk slowly, taking deep breaths. Advise the group that they should walk at their own pace, in any direction (if space allows), and to breathe deeply and slowly, as they take in the colours, sounds and notice the sensations below their feet. Allow 8 to 10 minutes for this activity. Notice your shoulders Practice: bring your attention to your shoulders, and relax. Then allow them to relax a little more than they are already. Commentary: when we lose awareness of what is going on, we tend to lose awareness of our bodies as well. This is especially so when we are tense. That's when we raise our shoulders, scrunching them up as though we are getting ready to launch ourselves into battle. As soon as we become aware of our shoulders we realise what we are doing to them and we relax them. Do yourself a favour and bring your attention to your shoulders more often, you will be more mindful and you will waste less energy tensing them up unnecessarily. If you want to go deeper: when you allow your shoulders to relax, also allow your spine to straighten a little. Experience this posture for a while and bring your breathing into your awareness as well. CF Activity - Relaxation Activities TFI/PUB-5145We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Mindful feet Practice: pay attention for a few moments to the sensation of your feet against the floor or the ground. Commentary: to do this you have to come out of your mental chatter and into reality. If you're sitting, how lightly are your feet resting on the floor? If you are standing, are you relaxed or tense? Do you notice a tingling sensation in the soles of your feet? Do your feet feel light against the floor or do they feel as though they are rooted? Either is good - this is just an awareness exercise. If you nd it hard to focus on your breathing, bringing your attention to your feet is a good technique. If you want to go deeper: bring your attention to that tingling sensation in your feet for a while. Notice if the sensations are becoming stronger or fainter, if your feet are getting warmer or cooler. Mindfulness of posture Practice: now and then become aware of your posture for a few moments. Commentary: becoming aware of your posture provides a very quick way to become mindful. It's especially helpful if you work in front of a computer, huddling into a screen with your muscles tensed up. It's also good for drivers who can easily tense up their neck and shoulder muscles without noticing. But mindfulness of posture was practised long before the invention of computers and cars. That's because the body isn't in the past or the future - it's here, in this present moment. And mindfulness of posture can bring an immediate sense of presence and calm. If you want to go deeper: when checking your posture, do a quick scan of your body, noting areas of tension and of calm. Allow your body to settle into a sense of balance. Wash your hands Practice: wash your hands mindfully, feeling the sensation of the water and soap. If you do not have access to a washbasin, imagine you are doing this exercise and do it for real when you get a chance. Alternatively, use hand cream and take the time to do it slowly and with care and mindfulness. Commentary: this is a good example of an everyday activity that you can use to bring you into mindfulness. Most of us wash our hands many times a day and we often do it in a distracted sort of way. Try bringing awareness to the task, guiding your attention back if it wanders. Feel the water, soap, the temperature of the water, the sensation of one hand washing the other. It is precisely because this is such a simple, practical, frequent, everyday act that washing your hands in awareness is such a useful mindfulness practice. If you want to go deeper: as well as washing your hands mindfully, dry them mindfully. When you have nished, try to bring some of that sense of awareness to whatever you do next. Urge surfing This might be useful to include in the healthy eating session. Practice: next time you feel hungry, notice what that's like for a little while before you eat. Connect with the physical sensation. Where is it in your body? Does it rise and fall in intensity? Does it cover a large or a small area? Commentary: we are, in many ways, creatures of habits and urges. Those who are most at the mercy of their urges have the least control over their lives. But urges rise and fall and becoming aware of an urge opens a space in which to make a choice to satisfy it or not. Eating healthily is essential, but we all have urges to do things that are not helpful to us. Seeing the urge rise and fall without having to satisfy it - urge surng - is a useful skill. Practise on the urge to eat but then eat what you need. If you want to go deeper: sit still for a time and notice the nature of the urge, as above. Notice how it changes. Rather than seeing yourself as resisting the urge, see yourself as observing it while creating space for choices. CF Activity - Relaxation Activities TFI/PUB-5146We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Drink your tea This might be useful during a break to reflect on drinking tea and/or coffee and not smoking and see what the experience is like. Practice: next time you're drinking a cup of tea (or coffee) be aware of at least the rst minute of the experience.Commentary: of the vast amount of tea and coffee drunk in the world every day, many are drunk with little or no awareness. That's a pity - a missed opportunity to enjoy one of the day's small pleasures. Bringing even a minute of awareness to the experience helps build a mindfulness practice into your day while doing something you were going to do anyway. And it means you get more value from your tea or coffee. If you want to go deeper: pay attention to the taste and aroma (smell). Think of the millions of other people who are having a tea or coffee right now and decide that you will be among those who do so in awareness.

Approximately how many chemicals are there in tobacco smoke? 2,000 4,000 10,000 Analysis of tobacco smoke shows that there are over 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke. Surgeon General 2004, CDC 2007. 2. How many of these chemicals are known to be cancer causing? None 35 60+ Over 60 chemicals in tobacco smoke are known to be carcinogens. Surgeon General 2004, CDC 2007. 3. On average how much does each cigarette shorten a tobacco user's life? 30 minutes 11 minutes Not at all Every cigarette you smoke shortens your lifespan by about 11 minutes. That's according to British researchers who calculated the effect of a lifetime of smoking with the number of cigarettes generally smoked in a lifetime. The average came out to 11 minutes. 4. How many people die in Ireland each year because of their tobacco use or the effects of second-hand smoke? 3,000 6,000 7,000+ Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland with almost 6,000 smokers dying each year from tobacco related diseases. In 2013, 5950 deaths were attributable to smoking and second hand smoke (HSE, State of Tobacco Control 2018). 5. How many people in Ireland are admitted to hospital for any condition relating to tobacco use each year? 5,000 2,100 33,000+ In 2016, it was estimated that there were 33,231 hospital inpatient admissions attributable to smoking. This figure has grown from 29,732 in 2011, and has seen an increase year on year between these years. These figures include hospitalisations for cancers, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, reproductive effects, and other associated effects. (HSE, the State of Tobacco Control, 2018). 6. Which type of cancer has the highest death rates among women in Ireland? Breast Lung Cervical During the period 2013 to 2015, lung cancer was attributed to 19.2% of all cancer deaths in women, while breast cancer attributed to 16.9% and cervical cancer to 2% of all cancer deaths in women. Based on demographic changes alone, annual numbers of cases of lung cancer are projected to increase in males from 1,356 in 2015 to 3,137 in 2045 (+131%) and in females from 1,130 in 2015 to 2,313 in 2045 (+84%). https://www.ncri.ie/sites/ncri/files/pubs/annualreport2018_26112018.pdf CF Solution Sheet - Tobacco quiz TFI/PUB-5148We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack 7. Women who smoke in pregnancy increase the risk of ... (Chose one or more answers) Ectopic pregnancy Low birth weight babies Babies are much slower to develop All three are correct. Prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke has significant adverse impacts on the health of the foetus including low birth weight, premature birth, spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. Maternal prenatal smoking is associated with both antisocial behaviour and ADHD in children and adolescents. This association remains after controlling for confounders such as socio-economic status, maternal age, birth weight and maternal psychopathology. 26 8. Men who smoke have an increased risk of death from prostate cancer True False 9. Tobacco smoke has no effect on fertility for men* True False 10. Tobacco smoke has no effect on fertility for women* True False *Questions 9 and 10 There is a strong association between tobacco use and reduced fertility. Howe et al (1985) reported that 5 years after stopping using contraception, 10.7% of smokers who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day, had decreased fertility (remained childless) compared to 5.4% of non-smokers. 27 Men who smoke have decreased sperm concentration, and decreased motility (how sperm swim). For those trying to conceive, both males and females should quit smoking. 11. Children are more likely to smoke if their parents smoke and/or their friends smoke True False Children are more likely to smoke if one or both parents smoke and also if their best friend/friends smoke.12. Young people who smoke can experience The same level of withdrawal as adults Less withdrawals than adult smokers No withdrawal symptoms at all Symptoms of serious nicotine addiction often occur only weeks or even just days after youth \"experimentation\" with smoking. Even irregular use and low quantity can produce the same withdrawal symptoms upon abstinence as for adults. 13. It is illegal for under 18s to buy tobacco True False It is illegal to sell tobacco to any persons under 18 but it's not illegal for under 18s to buy tobacco. 26 ASH Research Report.

Second hand smoke can cause an increased risk of ... (Choose one or more answer): Heart disease Cancer Asthma and Bronchitis All three are correct. It is estimated that second-hand smoke kills more than 600,000 people worldwide every year. A 2006 report of the U.S. Surgeon General states: \"There is no risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke. Non-smokers exposed to second hand smoke at home or work increase their risk of developing heart disease by 25% to 30% and lung cancer by 20% to 30%. This finding is a major public health concern.\" 15. How much of tobacco smoke goes directly into the air? 15% 45% 85% Most of the smoke from a cigarette goes directly into the air. This is called side-stream smoke. Second hand smoke is the mix of the 15% mainstream smoke exhaled by the smoker and the 85% side-stream smoke. 16. Children exposed to second hand smoke have an increased risk of... (Choose one or more answers): Asthma and Bronchitis Lower respiratory infections Middle ear disease Bacterial meningitis Sudden Infant Death Syndrome All five are correct. The WHO estimates that half of the world's children (700 million) are exposed to SHS. Children are especially vulnerable to the effects of SHS as they breathe more rapidly and they inhale more pollutants per pound of body weight than adults. A child exposed to SHS has an increased risk of asthma, lower respiratory infections, bronchitis, middle ear disease, bacterial meningitis and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) as well as generally reduced respiratory function (cough, wheezes). 17. What does nicotine do? (Choose one or more answer): Causes addiction Nothing Causes increase in heart disease 18. How quickly does it take nicotine to reach the brain? 7 seconds 30 seconds 60 seconds Questions 17 and 18: The main adverse effect of nicotine is addiction, which sustains tobacco use. Because most smokers are nicotine- dependent, they continue to expose themselves to toxicants from tobacco. Tobacco, not nicotine, is responsible for most of the adverse health effects. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug, as addictive as heroin or cocaine when delivered by means of tobacco products (USDHHS, 1988). 19. What does carbon monoxide do? (Choose one or more answer) Displaces oxygen Nothing Aids hardening of the arteries (Atherosclerosis) The 1st and 3rd points are correct: Carbon monoxide (CO) is absorbed into the blood from the lungs. It binds to haemoglobin in red blood cells about 200 times as readily as oxygen. It also reduces the release of oxygen. CO deprives the body of oxygen which the body needs to live. Smokers can have between 2% - 20% of their normal blood oxygen taken up by CO. CO damages health because the linings of the arteries are more permeable to cholesterol and this causes a fatty build up increasing the risk of circulation problems, heart attack and stroke. CF Solution Sheet - Tobacco quiz TFI/PUB-5150We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack 20. What does tar do? (Choose one or more answer): Nothing Causes cancer Causes smokers cough The 2nd and 3rd points are correct. Tar is the mix of organic and inorganic particles in tobacco smoke that are inhaled by the smoker. About 70% of the tar contained in the smoke ends up coating the lungs. An average smoker's lungs collect about a mug full of tar each year. When it condenses the tar forms a sticky brown substance. Tar contains many irritants that cause smoker's cough and also many cancer causing chemicals. Tar also stains fingers and teeth. 21. Light/Low Tar cigarettes cause the same harm as regular cigarettes? More harm than Less harm than The same harm as There is no strong scientific evidence that low-yield cigarettes are less harmful than regular cigarettes. \"Light\" cigarettes have tiny vent holes which help to dilute the amount of chemicals absorbed. However, smokers often inhale more deeply and block the vent holes with their fingers to get the dose of nicotine they need from each cigarette. Stopping smoking is the only way smokers can avoid the health risks of smoking. 22. Which of the following chemicals are in tobacco smoke? Please tick all that apply: Nicotine Formaldehyde Nickel Ammonia DDT Radon Arsenic Hydrogen cyanide Polonium - 210 Butane Lead All of the above are found in tobacco smoke. 23. People with mental health illness are more likely to use tobacco True False Psychiatric patients are twice as likely to smoke as the general population. People with mental health disorders who live in institutions exhibit rates of smoking in excess of 70%. One survey estimated that 45% of all cigarettes smoked were individuals with a psychiatric disorder. While general smoking rates are falling, this is not the case among psychiatric populations. Smoking related fatal diseases are more prominent among mental health patients than in the general population. 24. How many children does the tobacco industry need to recruit in Ireland each day if they want to maintain their profit margins? 25 50 75 The tobacco industry uses creative ways to aggressively pursue the next generation of \"replacement smokers,\" those who will buy their products in the future as their current customers quit or pass away.

CF Activity - Discussion on smoking on TV TFI/PUB-5153We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack \u00b7 Are you aware of any TV character that has quit smoking as their onscreen character? If so, how do you think that was portrayed? \u00b7 Are you aware of any anti-smoking messages on TV programmes? \u00b7 If you are with other people, including children, and watching a programme with smoking in it, what could you do to challenge this? CF Activity - Discussion on smoking on TVTFI/PUB-5154We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack General Discussion Points These questions can be used to prompt discussion about smoking; what influences our smoking behaviour; and the influence of the tobacco industry. How do you know what cigarettes to buy? \u00b7 I started smoking the same cigarettes as my friends \u00b7 Other people in my social group smoke the same brand \u00b7 It's designed by the tobacco manufacturer to appeal to people like me - my age, my social class, my sex \u00b7 Lots of people in my area smoke the same brand and it is always available in the local shops. How can the tobacco industry manipulate me? \u00b7 Smoking and health: The tobacco industry denied and continues to deny that smoking causes lung cancer - yet it has understood the carcinogenic (cancer causing) nature of its product since the 1950s \u00b7 Nicotine and addiction: Until recently the tobacco industry has denied its product is addictive. Internally, it has known since the 1960s that the crucial selling point of its product is the chemical dependence of its customers. Without nicotine addiction there would be no tobacco industry. Nicotine addiction destroys the industry's PR and legal stance that smoking is a matter of choice \u00b7 Marketing to children: The tobacco industry denies that it targets young people. Internal documents from various tobacco companies reveal that the market of young smokers is of central importance to the industry. Many documents reveal the companies' pre-occupation with teenagers and younger children - and the lengths they have gone to in order to influence smoking behaviour in this age group \u00b7 Cigarette design: Tobacco industry documents show that the companies initially hoped to make safer cigarettes. They abandoned the idea when they recognised that this would expose their existing products as \"unsafe.\" The industry has deliberately promoted \"low-tar\" cigarettes knowing that they would offer false reassurance without health benets. It has manipulated nicotine and introduced additives to change the delivery of nicotine \u00b7 Second hand smoke: The tobacco industry is challenged by second hand smoke in two ways. First, measures to protect non-smokers will reduce the opportunities to smoke and contribute to its social unacceptability. Second, the \"freedom to smoke\" arguments are lost if non-smokers are harmed. The industry has refused to accept the now overwhelming consensus regarding the harm caused by second hand smoke. Instead it has denied it and sought to influence debate by buying up scientists on a spectacular scale. CF Activity - General Discussion TFI/PUB-5155We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Why does the government complain about cigarettes and their health risks and still get lots of money from them? \u00b7 Tax on sale of cigarettes is a source of revenue for the government \u00b7 People were smoking and governments were taxing the sale of cigarettes before knowledge of the level of harm from smoking was known Does smoking and tobacco use damage the environment?28 \u00b7 Tobacco threatens many of the earth's resources. Its impact is felt in ways that extend far beyond the effects of the smoke released into the air by tobacco products when consumed. The harmful impact of the tobacco industry in terms of deforestation, climate change, and the waste it produces is vast and growing \u00b7 Tobacco is often grown without proper crop rotation which means that it is vulnerable to pests and disease. Therefore large amounts of chemicals are required to control them. Many of these chemicals are banned in some countries as they cause harm to the environment and the farmers working on the land \u00b7 Forests are cleared for tobacco plantation leading to mass deforestation \u00b7 Tobacco manufacturing uses a significantly large amount of water and energy when compared to other companies and manufacturers \u00b7 Use of plastic materials for packaging \u00b7 Tobacco smoke contains thousands of toxic chemicals, most of which are released into the air in the form of side-stream smoke \u00b7 With up to two-thirds of every smoked cigarette discarded onto the ground, between 340 and 680 million kilogrammes of waste tobacco product litters the world each year. The waste from these tobacco products contain 7000 chemicals, many known to be carcinogenic, which then leak into the environment. In addition to all of the above, tobacco farmers in low and middle income countries face an economic struggle, earning low wages for very labour intensive work. In some regions many of those working on the farms are children and they are therefore exposed to nicotine and pesticide poisoning - Green Tobacco Sickness - a type of nicotine poisoning caused by the dermal absorption of nicotine from the wet tobacco plants.

E-cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are electronic devices that heat a liquid (that can contain nicotine) to produce an aerosol which is then inhaled by the user. In Ireland, e-cigarettes are generally sold over the counter in retail premises, and are not approved for sale as a medicinal product. The latest Healthy Ireland Survey (2019) reported that 5% of adults (aged 15+ years) currently use e-cigarettes and 12% of adults have used them at some point. Can they help people to quit smoking? Some people may choose to use an e-cigarette to support them in their quit attempt. It is important to note that the current evidence-base on the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a stop smoking aid is \"mixed\" and is still evolving. A Health Research Board (HRB) review into e-cigarettes reported that they were no more effective than approved and regulated nicotine replacement therapy to help people stop smoking. In addition, they can cause harms including burns, poisonings and lung injuries. They also reported that e-cigarettes are associated with adolescents starting to smoke tobacco cigarettes, which could potentially lead to serious harm. 29 Therefore, the current recommendation is that people wishing to quit smoking use one of the evidence-based techniques such as behavioural support, NRT, Champix or Zyban, and not e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are not quit smoking. When speaking to participants or those enquiring about the use of e-cigarettes, you can use the following Discussion Points:\u00b7 E-cigarettes are consumer products. There is some regulation in place to protect consumers but not the same quality and safety system as would be in place for a licensed drug or medical device; \u00b7 People who do not smoke or use e-cigarettes should not start; \u00b7 For people who smoke and want to quit, advise them that there are a range of recommended and accessible support \u00b7 Smoking tobacco is extremely dangerous and, compared to this, e-cigarettes are likely to be less harmful. They are not harm-free though, and there is some uncertainty at the moment regarding their health impact; \u00b7 \u00b7 Dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes should be avoided; \u00b7 those who never used e-cigarettes; \u00b7 E-cigarettes' acute effects include poisonings, burns, blast injuries, lung injury and asthmatic attacks. Some of the chemicals in e-cigarettes are thought to cause tissue and cell damage and some are agents that may cause cancer in the long-term. The long-term health effects beyond 24 months are not researched yet; \u00b7 Dual use of both e-cigarettes and conventional tobacco cigarettes are more harmful than smoking tobacco cigarettes alone. 29 Summary report can be found here: https://www.hrb.ie/news/press-releases/single-press-release/article/new-health-research-board-evidence-shows-e-cigarettes-are - associated-with-adolescents-starting-to-sm/ CF Information - E-cigarettes TFI/PUB-5162We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Other Safety & Risk Issues to consider \u00b7 E-cigarettes on their own are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and lung disorders and adverse effects on the development of the foetus during pregnancy; \u00b7 E-cigarettes are undoubtedly harmful, should be strictly regulated and, most importantly, must be kept away from children; \u00b7 Nicotine is highly addictive and found in most e-cigarettes. Both tobacco products and e-cigarettes pose risks to health and the safest approach is not to consume either; 30 \u00b7 Some e-cigarettes look like ordinary cigarettes. The World Health Organisation has expressed concern that e-cigarettes may promote smoking as a gateway product introducing people to smoking. This might have a negative effect on the prevention of tobacco use because of their appearance, sweet flavourings and marketing, as safe alternatives to tobacco products for non-tobacco users, including children. Effects of E-cigarettes on non-users \u00b7 E-cigarettes do not produce second-hand smoke, but they do put substances into the air when they are used. The health impacts on people who breathe in this air are not yet known. 31 E-cigarettes and the law \u00b7 E-cigarettes are not sold as tobacco products because they do not contain tobacco, so they are not regulated by Tobacco Control Regulations; \u00b7 E-cigarettes contain nicotine, but they do not come under laws for nicotine replacement therapies because they are not licensed as a medicine to support someone to quit smoking; \u00b7 They do not come under any law for the use and sale of medicines because they are not medicines and they are marketed as smoking alternatives rather than aids to quit; \u00b7 At the moment, there are no methods to safely dispose of e-cigarettes and accessories. E-cigarette cartridges can leak and expose children, adults, pets and the environment to nicotine; \u00b7 In October 2019, the government published the General Scheme of the Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products Bill. The bill when finalised will restrict the sale of tobacco products, thus banning the sale of tobacco products at places or events that are intended for children, and will also ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children. This bill has yet to be finalised.

The TPD rules include maximum nicotine concentration levels and maximum levels of concentration for cartridges, tanks and containers of nicotine. It also requires manufacturers to ensure that e-cigarette ingredients are of high purity and that e-cigarettes deliver the same amount of nicotine for puffs of the same strength and duration. For more information on the full list of rules see: https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/ tobaccoproductdirective/ \u00b7 Under Regulation 26 of TPD, a manufacturer or importer of an e-cigarette or refill container must submit a notification to the HSE of any such products he or she intends to place on the Irish market and a notification of a new or a substantially modified product must be submitted not less than 6 months before placing it on the Irish market; \u00b7 The Environmental Health Service of the HSE is responsible for the enforcement of many provisions of the legislation. 32 https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/tobaccoproductdirective/ CF Information - E-cigarettes TFI/PUB-5164We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Cannabis Cannabis is a hallucinogen sedative.

It is found in tobacco leaves. It is also used as a natural weed killer. How is it used? Nicotine is a stimulant drug (upper). It is normally taken either through smoking cigarettes or through vaping an e-cigarette. These products contains many harmful chemicals. Short term effects \u00b7 Increases pulse rate and blood pressure \u00b7 Although smokers feel that it relieves stress and anxiety, it is actually the stress of needing to smoke that is satisfied by the nicotine hit. \u00b7 As it is a stimulant it can suppress appetite How addictive is nicotine? \u00b7 The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks nicotine as being more addictive than heroin, cocaine, alcohol, cannabis or caffeine. \u00b7 Tolerance - you need to take more to get the same effect. Other dangers Because nicotine is contained in cigarettes, which contains thousands of other chemicals, there are lots of dangers associated with it: \u00b7 Higher risk of getting coughs and chest infections \u00b7 Higher risk of cancer. 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking. Smoking is also associated with 30% of other cancers \u00b7 Chronic breathing problems such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma \u00b7 Heart attack/stroke \u00b7 Bad circulation \u00b7 Ulcers \u00b7 Increased risk of heart and circulatory problems for women who smoke while on the pill \u00b7 Increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight and cot death for women who smoke \u00b7 Increased risk of morbidity for men with prostate cancer. Withdrawal \u00b7 Cravings for nicotine and intense desire to smoke CF Information - NicotineTFI/PUB-5167We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Useful Terms Cancer A group of diseases in which cells in your body grow out of control. These abnormal cells can begin in one part of your body and spread to other body parts. There are many types of cancer. Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is given off when tobacco is smoked. You can't see or smell it. When you inhale your own tobacco smoke or other people's you take in carbon monoxide through your lungs. Chronic Long-lasting and slow to change. Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy Combination Nicotine Replacement therapy uses 2 forms of Nicotine Replacement Therapy* (NRT), normally the patch which releases nicotine slowly throughout the day and a faster acting NRT such as nicotine gum, inhalator or lozenge. This combination helps the person to have a constant base level of nicotine from the patch and also a second form of NRT to deal with the break through cravings, for example during times of stress, socialising, etc. Contraindication In medicine, a contraindication is a condition that serves as a reason to not take a certain medical treatment due to the harm that it would cause the person. Dosage How to take and the amount of medication to be taken. E-cigarettes E-cigarettes stands for electronic cigarettes. They are designed to deliver nicotine to a user in the form of a vapour. E-cigarettes have a rechargeable, battery-operated heating element, a cartridge that contains nicotine, and an atomizer which, when heated, turns the contents of the cartridge into a vapour. This vapour is then inhaled by the user. Using e-cigarettes to quit smoking is not recommended as it is not based on evidence as a quit smoking aid. Gender Gender refers to the roles, behaviours, activities, and characteristics that each society considers appropriate for men and women. So \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" are gender categories. Health33 Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not just the absence of disease or illness. Nicotine Nicotine is a stimulant which affects many body systems, including the brain, heart and nervous system. It is highly addictive. It is absorbed by the body very quickly, reaching the brain within 10 - 20 seconds. Nicotine increases the heart rate and blood pressure, leading to the heart needing more oxygen. 33 https://www.who.int/ CF Information - Useful termsTFI/PUB-5E-cigarettes stands for electronic cigarettes.

E-cigarettes have a rechargeable, battery-operated heating element, a cartridge that contains nicotine, and an atomiser which, when heated, turns the contents of the cartridge into a vapour. This vapour is then inhaled by the user. Using e- cigarettes to quit smoking is not recommended as a quit smoking aid .168We Can Quit - Community Facilitator's Pack Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), provides a small amount of nicotine to help reduce withdrawal symptoms. These treatments can make quitting more comfortable, as they reduce or remove the physical symptoms of withdrawal. NRT can make it easier to quit while you change your habit and attitude towards smoking, which can increase your chances of success. Relapse A relapse means going back to smoking regularly. A slip means having one or two after you quit. Risk Risk means the chance of a person or group of people getting a disease or illness. For example, if a person has a family history of heart disease and has high blood pressure and they smoke, they would have a \"higher risk\" of developing heart disease than someone who did not have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure or smoke. This does not mean that they will develop heart disease though it does mean their risk of getting it is higher. Risk factor Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease. Screening Checking for disease in healthy people. Symptoms A change or feature that you notice in your body. Sex Sex refers to the biological (genetic) and physiological (physical) characteristics that dene men and women. So, \"male\" and \"female\" are sex categories. Some examples of sex characteristics are that women have periods (menstruate) but men do not; and women have developed breasts that are usually able to produce milk, but men have not.
