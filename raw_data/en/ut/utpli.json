The good news is there are steps you can take to help keep you and your family healthy. Follow these steps to help prevent the flu: GET VAC- CINATED: The single best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine each season. The sea- sonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the up- coming season. To schedule an appointment for a flu shot at WCHD call 513 -695-1229. AVOID CLOSE CONTACT Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too. STAY HOME WHEN SICK If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. You will help prevent others from catching your illness. COVER MOUTH & NOSE WHEN COUGHING Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. WASH HANDS Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. AVOID TOUCHING EYES NOSES AND MOUTH Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. A person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, eyes or nose. CLEAN & DISINFECT SURFACES & OBJECTS Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu can help slow the spread of influenza.
