We are now located at: 5204 Paylor Ln, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34240. Welcome to Balance 4 Life Chiropractic located right here in Sarasota Florida.

Our office has had tremendous success with treating everything from knee pain to fibromyalgia. We look forward to helping you put the balance back in your life! Meet the Doctor I am Dr. D'Souza and would love to share a little bit about myself with you. I grew up in the state of New York (specifically the Queens & Long Island area). Since then I have also lived in Manhattan, Upstate NY and now Florida. I love the fact that I have lived in different communities which has given me a glimpse of all different styles of life. It's amazing to see that wherever I am, I seem to find areas of people that want to learn more about healthier lifestyles. Once you start feeling better you really get to enjoy the world around you. Honestly, I love the job I am in because it gives me the opportunity to help people feel better. I believe I can help you start enjoying the everyday moments that other people take for granted. After all we take the time to work hard isn't about time we make the time to play hard. I entered on to this career path a little later than most chiropractors as I used to be part of a family business in Manhattan's garment district. Here I was overseeing manufacturing, shipping and marketing of high-end men's and women's clothing. This included clothing for labels such as Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, and the PGA and LPGA tours. I loved working with my family but a part of me felt unfulfilled. It took a little time until I realized I was only truly happy when I was able to really help someone feel better. I love my job and don't ever regret the field I am in now. The favorite part of my job is having the privilege to play such an important role in people's lives, motivating them to value and take charge of their health. It's important for me to help educate patients regarding their health. You have a right to know why and how the treatment protocols we plan together can help you. These small lifestyle changes can have a huge impact on your overall well-being. Instead of telling you about my hobbies, sports, etc. I rather tell you the best part of my personal life, making memories with my family and friends. Education Bachelor of Arts: State University of Oswego Master's in Applied Clinical Nutrition: New York Chiropractic College Doctor of Chiropractic: New York Chiropractic College Tips from Dr. D'Souza How to Live a Healthy Lifestyle There is no better way to improve upon your health than to eat more nutritiously. Just a few simple changes in diet and lifestyle can have a positive impact on your health and life. It is seen that younger people are starting to suffer from more heart diseases, not just because of their diets, but from inactivity as well. Due to this trend, Chiropractors and other medical professionals are urging patients to eat a more balanced diet, drink more water, exercise daily, and balance their diets with the appropriate nutritional supplements. Here are a few tips you can use to better your lifestyle: - Move and exercise for at least 20-30 minutes a day. - Drink eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water a day. Drink less soda, alcohol, and coffee. - Have 25-30 grams of fiber every day. - Try to eat out less and make homemade meals more. Restaurants typically involve many wrong kinds of sugar and fat in their dishes. "}
