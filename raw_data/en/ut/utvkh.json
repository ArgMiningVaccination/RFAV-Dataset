Join us in embracing a new era of healthcare, where your well-being is at the forefront of our practice. - We Do Not. At our practice, we recognize the drawbacks of the current medical system, where insurance companies often create a divide between providers and patients. This third-party involvement can restrict the care that providers are able to offer, limiting the options available to patients. Unfortunately, when the primary focus of these third parties is financial gain, it can compromise what is truly best for the patient's well-being. The decreasing reimbursement rates from insurers place additional pressure on healthcare providers to see a higher volume of patients in order to sustain their practices. Consequently, this leads to rushed and shorter appointments, reducing the valuable face-to-face interaction between providers and patients. As a result, many providers are compelled to join large medical organizations, and standalone practices are becoming increasingly rare. When business models dictate care, both providers and patients bear the consequences. Furthermore, the use of detailed diagnosis codes and access to medical records can impact the confidentiality of the vital physician-patient relationship. We firmly believe that your medical decisions should remain yours and be treated with the utmost confidentiality and respect. At our practice, we strive to break away from these limitations and prioritize a direct and personal approach to healthcare. By eliminating third-party interference, we aim to provide comprehensive and individualized care that is solely focused on your well-being. Rest assured that your medical decisions and personal information are held in the strictest confidence, promoting a trusted and secure environment for your healthcare needs. - Membership Fee Structure: At Future Hope, we offer a simple and transparent fee structure for our Direct Primary Care membership.
