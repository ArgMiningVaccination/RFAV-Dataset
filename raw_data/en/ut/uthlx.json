Ayurveda is an ancient Sanskrit word that means \"the science of life,\" but how can it make you healthier and happier? Ayurveda and its teachings were recorded in Sanskrit by Sushruta Samhita in a series of four sacred texts where Dhanvantari, the Hindu God of Ayurveda, incarnated himself on earth to teach medicine to a group of physicians. Thus, [Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.integrativenutrition.com/ayurvedic-guide) was documented to be shared with the world! As a form of holistic and preventative medicine that focuses on creating health and harmony through the connection between mind, body, and spirit, Ayurveda is especially important in today's [high-stress](https://www.integrativenutrition.com/blog/how-stress-affects-your-hormones) world. Ayurvedic traditions say that the human body is made of the very same materials and elements as the ones that make up the entire universe, which means it's very important to balance these universal elements within ourselves to also experience outer harmony. As you might imagine, Ayurveda is a well-respected tool and tradition that many embrace today for better overall well-being. To utilize and enjoy Ayurveda on your own healing journey, it is important to know its principles - both to use them properly and out of respect for Ayurveda's sacred nature. There are [three doshas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719489/#:~:text=Ayurveda%2C%20the%20traditional%20medical%20system,Vata%2C%20Pitta%2C%20and%20Kapha.), or energies, that circulate throughout the human body known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha is believed to be responsible for different aspects of your physical, mental, and spiritual health. It is very common to have one dominant dosha, while the others may be less prominent or only apply to certain areas of your life. Determining your dosha can be as simple as reading up on each and seeing which aligns most with your physical, mental, and spiritual being, or you can [take a quiz](https://chopra.com/dosha-quiz). This is the beauty of Ayurveda - you find what resonates most with you and your unique body makeup! Ayurvedic teachings say the universe is composed of Five Great Elements: Space, water, earth, air, and fire. Imbalances of these elements can cause unwanted symptoms, disease, and discomfort. To balance your body through Ayurveda, you observe which elements are overworked and which ones are underutilized. From there, Ayurvedic practices and treatments exist that can calm the extremeness of overworked elements and bring more attention to those that are underworked. Gunas are the qualities you observe using your senses. Out of 20 total [gunas in Ayurveda](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358957285_Introspection_into_the_Guna_Wisdom_of_Ayurveda-A_Review_From_the_Clinical_Perspective), the tradition focuses on three main gunas, which are Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva: Just like you possess all three doshas in some quantity, all three gunas are also present within you and are all necessary to maintain or restore balance to your life. Ayurvedic medicine works to restore balance by observing the symptoms you are experiencing and finding complementary practices for your dominant dosha. Ayurvedic medicine and its practices focus on making consistent and sustainable lifestyle choices for the long run. Ayurveda focuses on making healthier lifestyle choices and the mind-body connection. This looks like prioritizing proper nutrition, leading an active lifestyle, adding mindfulness practices and bodywork, and supplementing with herbal remedies. These practices can relieve stressors within the body and thus improve your overall health. Ayurvedic principles are practical and can be easily integrated into your daily routine, thus creating balance in your day-to-day as well. Consistent use of Ayurvedic practices has been shown to support the [prevention of chronic disease and illness.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170500/) Ayurveda encourages healthier lifestyle choices that naturally lower stress levels.

To begin, [proper diet and nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815005/) are fundamental for your health. Ayurvedic medicine promotes a nutrient-dense and antioxidant-rich diet. It encourages a mostly-plant based eating diet that has a variety of foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats, herbs, spices, and protein. Ayurvedic medicine is specific to the individual, so you will make dietary choices based on factors like your environment, what season you are currently in, the timing of your meals, your ancestry and genetics, and properties of the foods themselves that complement your dominant dosha. This practice aims to lower inflammation in the body, lower risk of disease, and improve mental health and digestion. Spices like licorice root, turmeric, and [curcumin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19233493/) have anti-inflammatory properties and improve heart health. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/) have shown the plant ashwagandha alleviates anxiety and stress. However, it is important to work with an Ayurvedic practitioner before you add herbal medicine as nutritional supplementation. Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. Yoga aims to connect the mind, body, and spirit, similar to the intentions of Ayurveda. Research has shown that [regular physical yoga practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3193654/) can lower stress levels and increase quality of life.
