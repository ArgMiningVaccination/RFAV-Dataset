It is one component of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) aimed at restoring balance, healthy energy and blood flow to the body. In TCVM theory, an individual's life, emotions and activity are intimately related to its environment and disease is the result of an imbalance between these internal and external influences, causing a disruption to the energy, \"Qi\" and blood flow in the body. Stimulation of specific acupuncture points along a channel or meridian which is connected to its related organs inside the body have the ability to alter various biochemical and physiologic changes to manage pain and restore health. In animals, veterinary acupuncture can be used alone, or in conjunction with conventional western medicine and surgery. It provides a safe, holistic and drug-free approach to manage pain and a range of conditions where conventional medications are not working, or are contraindicated because of possible side effects, or when surgery is not feasible. While acupuncture may not completely cure an animal in certain illnesses, it can alleviate their symptoms and improve their quality of life.
