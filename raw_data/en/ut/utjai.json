This vaccine is used to help prevent yellow fever. The vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. You should receive the vaccine at least 10 days prior to your arrival in an area where you may be exposed to the virus. This vaccine is also recommended for people who work in a research laboratory and may be exposed to yellow fever virus through needle-stick accidents or inhalation of viral droplets in the air. Like any vaccine, the yellow fever vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person. uses What is Yellow Fever Vaccine (Stamaril) used for? - Yellow Fever Prophylaxis warnings What is the most important information I should know about Yellow Fever Vaccine (Stamaril)? You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a yellow fever vaccine, or if you have: - an allergy to eggs or chicken proteins; - cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma; - a weak immune system caused by disease (such as cancer, HIV, or AIDS), or by taking certain medicines such as steroids; - a disorder such as myasthenia gravis; - a disease or tumor of the thymus gland, or if your thymus gland has been surgically removed; or - if you have received a transplant. Children younger than 9 months should not receive yellow fever vaccine. If you have a high risk of exposure to yellow fever, you may need to receive the vaccine even if you have an allergy to eggs or chicken products. Your doctor can give you the vaccine in several small doses to avoid an allergic reaction. In special cases, a doctor or health official may determine that an adult 60 years and older should receive a yellow fever vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have ever had: - a seizure; - a neurologic disorder or disease affecting the brain (or if this was a reaction to a previous vaccine); - a bleeding or blood clotting disorder such as hemophilia; or - Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving this vaccine. Vaccines may be harmful to an unborn baby and generally should not be given to a pregnant woman. However, not vaccinating the mother could be more harmful to the baby if the mother becomes infected with a disease that this vaccine could prevent. Your doctor will decide whether you should receive this vaccine, especially if you have a high risk of infection with yellow fever. Ask a doctor if it is safe to breastfeed after receiving this vaccine. Do not breastfeed if the child is less than 9 months old. Side Effects What are the side effects of Yellow Fever Vaccine (Stamaril)? Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; wheezing, chest tightness, difficult breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first vaccine. Keep track of all side effects that occur within 30 days after you receive this vaccine. If you ever need a booster dose, you will need to tell your doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects. Seek medical attention right away if you have any of these symptoms similar to yellow fever that may occur within 10 days after vaccination: - fever, headache, confusion, extreme tiredness; - muscle pain or weakness; - a light-headed feeling, like you might pass out; - easy bruising, unusual bleeding; - little or no urination; or - vomiting, loss of appetite, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).

Common side effects may include: - fever; - vomiting, nausea; - headache; - joint or muscle pain; - tiredness or weakness; or - pain, discomfort, redness, swelling, or a hard lump (induration) where the infection was given. This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). After receiving the vaccine, you will be given an International Certificate of Vaccination (yellow card) from the clinic where you receive your yellow fever vaccine.
