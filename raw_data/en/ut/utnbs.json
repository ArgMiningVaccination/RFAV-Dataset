It describes the healthy and unhealthy state of life (mind and body) and describes the methods of balancing unhealthy conditions. Ayurveda focuses on the wellness of every person as a whole. Since the constitution differs from person to person, the wellness therapies also differ and are unique to every individual. Human beings have remarkable recuperative powers that can heal the body on its own without external chemical or surgical interference, which simply suppresses symptoms but does not heal nor remove the root cause of the disease. Naturopathy seeks to heal the body by promoting its own internal processes. Naturopathy gives importance to internal hygienic conditions using healing therapies such as Dietetics, Hydrotherapy, Mud therapy, Reflexology, and Massage, among others. Yoga is a lifestyle, to be incorporated. It includes practices like Kriyas, Asanas, Pranayama, Bandha, Mudra, Meditation etc. Reiki is a holistic energy healing technique where a certified healer directs universal energy to the person who seeks healing. This restores your emotional, physical and spiritual energy.
