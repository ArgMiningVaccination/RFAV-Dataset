INTRODUCTION The discovery of practical and effective antibiotics in the mid 1940's led many to believe that infectious diseases were no longer a threat to human life.1 Instead, the very use of these treatments has enhanced the biological phenomenon of antibiotic resistance and given rise to diseases that humans can no longer cure with antibiotics.2 These diseases are called \"superbugs,\" and they represent perhaps the greatest threat to global public health in the twenty-first century.3 * Doctor of Jurispr udence Candidate, University of Houston Law Center, 2012. 1 See Ross Upshur, Ethics and Infectious Diseases, 86 B ULL.

J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y While superbugs are a frightening reminder of the adaptability and ingenuity of microorganisms, they are also the direct result of mankind's chronic misuse and persistent overuse of antibiotics.4 Large public health organizations, such as the World Health Organization, have identified the persistent overuse of sub-optimal doses of antibiotics in animals as a primary source of antibiotic resistance. 5 Improper use of antibiotics by medical professionals and patients also has a substantial impact on antibiotic resistance.6 These behaviors can be influenced by the legal system, and through the use of regulation, legislation, and punishment, the human impact on antibiotic resistance can be limited. This comment will discuss the potential legal solutions to the pr oblem of antibiotic resistance. Specifically, this comment discusses potential modifications to intellectual property law, legislative initiatives, the use of tort damages to deter improper antibiotic use, and FDA regulation of antibiotics in animals and humans. The first section will discuss the biological and social foundations of antibiotic resistance. The second section will discuss the potential legal solutions to these problems. 4 See STUART B.

RESISTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 37 II.THE ROOTS OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE A. The History and Current Status of Antibiotics The term \"antibiotic\" was first used as a noun in 1941 by Selmon Walksin to describe a class of mole cules that directly antagonized the growth of microorganisms.7 While the descriptive term for these molecules did not arise until the 1940s, the search for compounds that could neutralize the effects of infectious microbes dates back to the late nineteenth century.8 Early antibiotics, such as pyocyanase and salvarsan, did effectively inhibit the growth of infectious microorganisms, but they were too toxic and unstable to be used as a practical medical treatment.9 Alexander Fleming's chance discovery of penicillin in 1928 represents the first true antibiotic that was effective, reliable, and safe to use in humans.10 Penicillin first gained worldwide attention when it was used to combat infection in burn victims after the Cocoanut Grove fire of 1942.11 While penicillin would go on to become one of the most successful and influential medical treatments in the history of mankind, Fleming immediately recognized the potential for the deve lopment of antibiotic resistance, and cautioned the audience at his Nobel Prize acceptance speech 7 See Clardy et al., supra note 2. 8 Colin Robert Crossman, Arming Our Enemies: How Parallel Imports Could Increase Antimicrobial Resistance , 31 N.C.J.

This lecture detailed the serendipity of Fleming's discover y. After returning from vacation, Fleming noticed that one of his Petri dishes had been contaminated by a \"mould\" that appeared to be destroying the staphylococci bacteria also growing on the plate. Levy, supra note 4, at 37; see Fleming, Penicillin . Further investigation led to the e lucidation of penicillin, which he decided to name after the mould from which it was derived; a fungus belonging to the genus Penicillium . See Fleming, Penicillin . 11 See Levy, supra note 4, at 1-7. The Cocoanut Grove was a popular bar in the Boston area that caught fire, killing hundreds, and leav ing many survivors horribly burned. Id. at 2-4. The burn victims faced the dim reality that their weakened immune systems would be easily overcome by infection, a prognosis that compelled the U.S. government to release a substantial quantity of penicillin to th e public for the first time in history. Id. at 1-2, 5. 38 HOUS. J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y about the dangers of \"underdosage.\"12 Fleming observed that underdosage \"educate[d] the microb es\" to resist the effects of penicillin, leaving those subsequently infected by the surviving resistant microbes unresponsive to the same antibiotics that were once effective in treating the disease.13 These observations were remarkably prophetic, as penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria had become widespread by 1949, only seven years after the Cocoanut Grove fire.14 Today, there are many different classes of antibiotics available to medical practitioners.15 However, many of the organisms that these antibiotics are designed to treat are quickly developing resistance to drugs in all classes.16 Perhaps even more troubling is the fact that the development of new antibiotics has ground to a halt as large pharmaceutical companies, once the leaders in antibiotics research and development, have shifted their focus to more profitable and less costly research endeavors.17 The lack of any viable replacements or alternatives for antibiotics that are no longer effective makes the resurrection of once well-controlled diseases, such as tuberculosis, 12 Fleming, supra note 10, at 93 (\"It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body.\"). 13 Id.

Mankind's Role in Antibiotic Resistance While the details regarding the development and spread of antibiotic resistance are complex and dependent on many different factors, one thing is clear: the perpetuation of antibiotic resistance is accelerated by the excessive use of antibiotics by humans. 32 Constant exposure to antibiotics selects th ose microorganisms best suited to survive treatment, and the natural ab ility of microorganisms to share genetic information allows for the expansion of resistance until an entire bacterial species becomes resistant to a given antibiotic.33 By 27 See Appelbaum, supra note 20, at 81 (\"Resistance to penicillin among strains of S.

Humans misuse antibiotics in three significant settings: the medical setting, the antibacterial hygiene product setting, and the veterinary or food animal production setting.34 In the medical setting, behaviors of both the patient and the physician contribute to antibiotic resistance.35 Many patients unknowingly contribute to antibiot ic resistance by insisting on receiving the newest and most expensive antibiotic treatments available.36 By pressuring their healthcare providers into prescribing the newest antibiotic treatment, patients are exposing infectious microbes to new classes of antibiotic and encouraging the selection of organisms resistant to these ra re and valuable treatments.37 The overuse of these drugs makes them less and less effective over time.38 A more common mistake made by patients is to stop taking antibiotics before completion of the course of treatment prescribed by the physician. 39 By failing to complete the entire course of treatment, patients do not completely eradicate the infection from their bodies.40 Instead, the microbes that are most resistant to the antibiotic being used remain viable and multiply, creating a new and more resistant significant acceleration of the rate of microbial evolution.\"). 34 See World Health Org., supra note 5. 35 Id.

The debate over antibacterial hygiene products and their relation ship to antibiotic resistance appears to be just beginning. Another significant area of human contribution to antibiotic resistance is the overuse of antibioti cs in animals raised for food.49 The use of antibiotics in animal feed to promote the healthy growth of animals raised for food began in the late 1950's without any investigation as to the potential consequences of the addition. 50 The observation that those animals whose feed was treated with antibiotics grew larger than those without antibiotics, also known as the \"antibiotic growth effect,\" has never been fully explained, and resistance issues related to these products are needed.\"). 47 See id.

J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y few published studies have investigated the legitimacy of these observations.51 Despite the tenuous nature of the antibiotic growth effect's scientific rationale, the vast majority of livestock antibiotics are administered for non-therapeutic purposes, such as enhanced growth and the prevention of disease.52 Unlike therapeutic doses that treat an animal in response to infection for a given period of time, non-therapeutic doses of antibiotics, such as those administered as antibiotic growth promoters, treat a large amount of animals at one time as a preventative measure designed to reduce costs. 53 This indiscriminate dosing results in th e ingestion of sub-optimal doses of antibiotics by food animals, making them the perfect incubators for antibiotic-resistant infections. 54 These resistant organisms are then passed to humans when the animals are slaughtered and eaten.55 In short, antibiotic resistance is a problem that is directly exacerbated by human actions. In order to combat antibiotic resistance, humans must find ways to reduce the chronic misuse and overuse of antibiotics. III.THE LEGAL SOLUTIONS TO ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE The problem of antibiotic resistance has not been ignored, but a truly comprehensive solution to the problem has yet to emerge.56 This is partly due to the numerous and complex root causes of antibiotic resistance.57 Despite these difficulties, antibiotic resistance 51 While it has been hypothesized that the antibi otic growth effect is caused by the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal tract of the animal, this hypothesis has never been verified, and the efficacy of adding antibiotic s to animal feed remains an open question.

This section discusses four possible legal solutions to the problem of antibi otic resistance: 1) intellectual property strategies and the use of patents to provide economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop novel antibiotics; 2) legislative strategies that impose statutory guidelines on antibiotic usage in medical, hygiene, and vete rinary settings; 3) tort remedies, such as punitive damages, as a means of curbing the persistent misuse and overuse of antibiotics; and 4) FDA regulation using a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\"REMS\") to restrict the use of antibiotics in both humans and animals. A. Intellectual Property Strategies A major problem in the battle against antibiotic resistance is the lack of novel antibiotics to replace those that no longer effectively treat organisms that have developed resistance to other antibiotic treatments.58 In fact, a 2004 survey of fifteen major pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, revealed that out of the 506 drugs in the research and development pipeline at that time, only five were antibiotics.59 The major cause of this decline in antibiotic development is the poor return on investment pharmaceutical compan ies experience when producing new antibiotics.60 One reason antibiotics have a lower rate of return practices; patients' irrational demand for antibi otics even when they may not be effective; unwarranted clinical variation in the way physicians prescribe and monitor antibiotics; inappropriate patterns of antibiotic use in agriculture and food-animal products that may impact human health; and a possible downturn in discovery and commercial development of antibiotics.\"). 58 See Overbye & Barrett, supra note 15, at 51.

These \"supply side\" approaches propose significant changes to patent system incentives in order to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest in novel antibiotic therapies.64 For example, the Infectious Diseas es Society of America (\"IDSA\") has strongly advocated the extension of patent periods for novel antibiotics to allow pharmaceutical companies to enjoy market exclusivity for significantly longer periods of time. 65 Proponents of extended patent periods for antibiotics argue that, in addition to allowing more time for pharmaceutical companies to generate profits and recoup investment, a longer period of monopoly will encourage pharmaceutical companies to reserve antibiotics for future public health threats when the highest po ssible prices can be obtained. 66 Thus, while pharmaceutical companies are more likely to invest in multi-factorial, but fundamentally, each fact or relates to return on investment.\"). 61 Id.

B. Legislative Strategies Another method for combating antibiotic resistance could come from the legislative branch of the federal government. While Congress has not ignored the problem of antibiotic resistance, it has yet to take decisive action to address the problem in a comprehensive manner. Congress first tackled antibiotic resistance in 1995 when the Congression al Office of Technolo gy Assessment issued the \"Impacts of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria\" report.79 In 1999, the General 75 Id. 76 Id.

In September 2007, the Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act (\"STAAR Act\") was first introduced by Representatives Matheson (D-UT) and Ferguson (R-NJ).84 The bill sought to combat antibiotic resistance by funding data compilation and awareness programs. 85 Despite vigorous endorsement from scientific organizations, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the American Public antibiotic resistant bacteria.\"). 80 U.S. GEN.

Unfortunately, Congress appears reluctant to tackle the issue head- on, perhaps because of a strong lobbying presence from agribusiness 86 Infectious Diseases Society of America, Organizations Endorsing the STAAR Act, http://www.idsociety.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=15947 (last visited Feb. 27, 2011); see also Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act, S. 2313, 110th Cong.

RESISTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 51 interests that depend on antibiotic use as a method of cost control.92 Experts have identified pharmaceutical and agribusiness lobby groups as the primary reason why comprehensive antibiotic resistance legislation, such as PAMTA, has been repeatedly abandoned by lawmakers.93 As long as these powerful lobby groups continue to exert pressure on Congress, it is unlikely that comprehensive legislation attacking antibiotic resistance will ever become a reality. In short, despite the willingness of some members of Congress to address anti biotic resistance and the existence of proposed legislation that experts feel could make a difference, Congress has not and likely will not take the drastic action most experts feel is necessary to combat antibiotic resistance. C. Tort Remedies Tort remedies, such as punitive damages, could be used as a mechanism to deter the behaviors that contribute to antibiotic resistance. Proponents of the use of punitive damages as a method of influencing behavior argue that punitive damages serve two primary purposes. 94 First, punitive damages punish past wrongful conduct.95 Second, punitive damages deter future wrongful conduct.96 In determining whether punitive damages are appropriate, most jurisdictions require more than mere negligence. 97 Courts often require \"a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of 92 Kammerle Schneider & Laurie Garrett, Non-therapeutic Use of Antibiotics in Animal Agriculture, Corresponding Resistance Rates, and What Can be Done About It , Center for Global Development, http://www.cgdev.org/content/gen eral/detail/1422307/ (last visited Feb. 27, 2011) (quoting Representative Slaughter as saying, \"[w]e're up against a pretty strong lobby.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y others.\"98 Some courts use an expanded gross negligence standard that includes \"conscious indifference to consequences\" as a justification for awarding punitive damages.99 Punitive damages are awarded in a variety of different types of actions, including personal injury claims and mass tort claims. 100 In the case of antibiotic resistance, the wrongful conduct to be deterred is the chronic misuse and overuse of antibiotics in both humans and livestock. Both physicians who inappropriately prescribe antibiotics to patients and industrial food producers that use sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics in livestock feed could be argued to be consciously indiffere nt to the consequences of their actions. 101 Thus, should a plaintiff bring a personal injury or mass tort claim against a physician or industrial food producer seeking compensation for injury caused by an antibiotic resistant infection that could be traced to the conduct of the defendant, a court could award punitive damages as a method of deterring the defendants from engaging in the behaviors that contributed to the creation and perpetuation of antibiotic resistant organisms. While the use of punitive damages as a deterrent is compatible with the goal of deterring the inappr opriate use of antibiotics, there are major problems with this approach.102 First, the traditional negligence tort law norms of duty , breach, causation, and damages may be insurmountable obstacles fo r plaintiffs attempting to sue physicians or industrial farm animal producers.103 Physicians 98 Id. at 9. 99 Id. at 10. 100 Id. at 11-14.

See Bell & Pierce, supra note 94, at 4-9 (arguing that punitive damages are so inconsistently used and incompatible with ju stice that their use should be completely abandoned or drastically reformed). 103 Scott B. Markow, Penetrating the walls of Drug-Resistant Bacteria: A Statutory Prescription to RESISTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 53 probably do not owe a duty to the population as a whole or even a class of potential victims not to mi suse antibiotics on an individual patient.104 On the contrary, physicians owe a duty to their patients to treat and cure bacterial infections.105 As one commentator has pointed out, \"[b]ecause any use of antibiotics will lead to some development of resistance, if practitioners had a duty to the population to never induce resistance, they could never prescribe antibiotics to patients, even for a legitimate use.\"106 Courts are unlikely to create such a paradox by imposing a duty on a physician not to misuse antibiotics on individual patients.107 In the case of industrial farm animal production, imposing a duty on producers not to misuse antibiotics in order to protect the consumer may be more realistic, but it is still a stretch from the traditional common law duties recognized in most jurisdictions. 108 Even if a duty not to misuse antibiotics were to be recognized in either context, it would be very difficult for any plaintiff to prove that, but for the defendant's misuse of antibiotics, they would not have been infected by an antibiotic resistant organism. 109 It would be equally difficult for potential plaintiffs to prove that the misuse of antibiotics by the defendant was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's Combat Antibiotic Misuse , 87 G EO.

J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y injury.110 As a result, a plaintiff is unlikely to succeed in bringing a negligence action against a physician or industrial farm animal producer for misuse of antibiotics because of the difficulties in proving duty, breach, causation, and damages. The second major problem with a negligence suit seeking punitive d amages against physicians or food animal producers is the prospect that any such lawsuit may be pre-empted by federal law.111 Under the Supremacy Clause, state law claims can be pre-empted explicitly, implicitly, or when comp liance with both federal and state law is impossible. 112 Congress can implicitly pre-empt state law \"when it is clear, despite the absence of explicit pre-emptive language, that Congress has intended, by legislating comprehensively, to occupy an entire field of regulation and has thereby left no room for the State to supplement federal law.\" 113 Pre- emption would be a viable affirmat ive defense for industrial farm animal producers because \"[m]edicated animal feeds and drugs used in treating animals which are raised for human consumption are also c o n t r o l l e d b y t h e F D C A a s p a r t o f i t s c o m p r e h e n s i v e s c h e m e t o protect the public from drugs that may be unsafe or ineffective for their intended uses.\" 114 However, claims against physicians for misuse of antibiotics may not nece ssarily be pre-empted by federal law.115 110 This depends on the causation st andard to be applied. Under the Polemis test, there must be a direct link between the event an d the injury. In the case of antibiotic resistant infection, several intervening causes could supersede th e actions of physicians and industrial farm animal producers and break the chain of caus ation because it is nearly impossible to determine the source of ba cterial infection. The Wagon Mound foreseeability test is more friendly to plaintiffs in this situation. Under this test, the defendant must have foreseen the particular type of harm, but not the specific victim, mechanism, or severity of injury.

Another strategy is necessary to more adequately addr ess antibiotic resistance in the future. D. FDA Regulation: A Novel Regulatory Approach The approach to combating antibiotic resistance that shows the most promise is top-down regulatory reform starting with the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). The FDA has been widely criticized for its lack of response to the problem of antibiotic resistance.116 In response to this criticism, the FDA has recently taken a much tougher approach to antibiotic resistance and has at its disposal two novel methods to combat the problem.117 This section will first discuss how the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") can be used to compel the FDA to ban the use of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics in livestock feed. 118 It will then discuss how the FDA can use its expanded statutory authority under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (\"FDAAA\") to impose a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\"REMS\") as a means of combating the inappropriate use of antibiotics by physicians. 119 Congress.

The Administrative Procedure Act Should the FDA continue to lag be hind the rest of the world in effectively responding to the problem of antibiotic resistance, concerned citizens and scientists could use the APA to petition the FDA to withdraw the approval of antibiotics used in livestock feed.120 Agency action or inaction is subj ect to judicial review through the APA, which mandates that government agencies must allow for a system of petition, repeal, modification, or creation of agency rules. 121 The FDA complies with this mandate through a \"citizen petition\" process by which concerned parties can ask the FDA to issue, change, or cancel a regulation, or to take other action.122 Under the program, the FDA can take more than a year to decide whether or not to grant a petition, but it must furnish some form of response to the petitioner.123 Once the FDA makes a decision pursuant to the petition, that decision is reviewable under the APA.124 This process affords concerned sc ientists, public officials, and citizens the opportunity to co mpel the FDA to do what no governmental body in the United States seems willing to do but what most experts agree is necessary to most effectively combat antibiotic resistance: ban the use of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics in livestock feed. 125 The FDA has the authority to accomplish this goal by withdrawing its approval of the antibiotics used in livestock feed, thus making any addition of these antibiotics to livestock feed illegal.126 Should the FDA deny the petition arguing such action, the 120 Lessing, supra note 116, at 482; see also THE DANISH INTEGRATED ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE MONITORING AND RESEARCH PROGRAMME , http://www.danmap.org (last visited Feb. 27, 2011). 121 Lessing, supra note 116, at 482.

RESISTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 57 judicial review process mandated by the APA gives the challenging party the opportunity to use the vast amount of persuasive data to argue that such action is indeed necessary to prevent antibiotic resistance from rendering our most important medical assets obsolete. 127 While the APA petition process does hold real promise as a method to combat antibiotic resistance, there are drawbacks to this strategy. Standing is one major conc ern. A party seeking to challenge a decision by the FDA rejecting the petition must have standing under Article III of the Constitution in order for the decision to receive judicial review. 128 This requirement can present a major hurdle for the challenging party to overcome because of the difficulty of demonstrating injury-in-fact. 129 One way of overcoming this hurdle is to include plaintiffs who can argue a particularized harm, such as those with deficient immune systems or those who live in close proximity to animal feed lots because these individuals are particularly susceptible to the consequences of antibiotic misuse. 130 Another potential problem is the tendency of courts to show considerable deference to agencies when their actions are judicially reviewed.131 Significantly, despite numerous petitions arguing for the withdrawal of approval for drugs with major public health implications, the FDA has never withdrawn approval of a drug as a direct result of the APA petition process.132 However, in light of the FDA's recent shift to a tougher stan ce regarding antibiotic resistance, a petition may be more likely to succeed.133 At the very least, a petition may offer concerned parties the opportunity to influence the 127 Id. at 488-89 (\"Because of the plethora of available data on the impact of animal antibiotics to human health . . . ju dicial review is a particularly usef ul tool in the case of antibiotic bans.\"). 128 See U.S. CONST . art.

J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y FDA as it revisits its policy regarding antibiotics in livestock feed in the twenty-first century.134 In short, the APA petition proce ss is not the perfect solution to FDA inaction regarding antibiotics in animal feed, but at the very least it could provide a means by which interested parties could exert some influence on future regulatory reform. 2. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy While it is clear that physician prescription writing habits play an important role in antibi otic resistance,135 the FDA's long standing policy of regulating only the availability of drugs as opposed to the methods in which drugs are used has prevented it from influencing physician prescription writing behavior.136 By imposing REMS use restrictions on antibiotics that are in need of preservation, the FDA could effectively limit the misuse of antibiotics by physicians and maintain the effectiveness of thes e medications well into the future. REMS restrictions permit the FDA to restrict the use of a drug in order to ens ure that the benefits of its use outweigh its risks.137 The FDA can impose a REMS restriction when a drug is initially approved, or after a drug has been approved and is currently in use, if new evidence of the risks associated with the drug comes to light.138 If a drug sponsor does not comply with the terms of the REMS restriction, that sponsor's sale of the drug becomes unlawful.139 The FDA may also use a REMS restriction to block the approval of new drugs, or to withdraw the approval of existing drugs.140 There are six ways by which a REMS restriction can mitigate 134 Id. 135 See supra text accompanying notes 35-45. 136 Evans, supra note 119, at 517 (\"FDA long has described its role as determining which medical products are available, but letting ph ysicians decide how the products should be used.\").

By doing so, the FDA could require that physicians prescribing these medications meet the requirements of safe use as defined under the statute. 149 For example, the FDA could require that patients who are prescribed a REMS restricted antibiotic undergo testing to confirm the diagnosis of a bacterial infection.150 This testing could ensure that the antibiotic would only be used on patients with bacterial infections instead of on patients who exaggerate symptoms or demand antibiotics for viral infections. 151 B y e n s u r i n g t h a t a n antibiotic is only used when necessary, the FDA would be able to limit the development of antibiotic resistance and prolong the life- 141 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355-1(f)(3) (Supp \u00a7 355-1(f)(3)(B). 144 Id. \u00a7 146 Id. 147 Id. \u00a7 355-1(f)(3)(E). 148 Id. at \u00a7 Id. at 355-1(f). 150 Id. at \u00a7 355-1(f)(3)(D). 151 See supra text accompanying notes 35-45. 60 HOUS. J. HEALTH L. & POL'Y span of a restricted treatment. Application of a REMS restriction is not without its drawbacks. For one, it 's unclear whether or not the risk of contributing to the phenomenon of antibiotic resistan ce through potential misuse of antibiotics outweighs the benefits of properly prescribing them.152 A REMS restriction on the use of antibiotics runs the risk of chilling the appropriate use of antibiotics and adversely affecting patient outcomes. 153 REMS restrictions on antibiotic use could also represent a serious threat to physician autonomy and impermissibly intrude into the practice of medicine. 154 Furthermore, improper antibiotic use in humans is only one part of a large and complex global problem. Despite these concerns, REMS restrictions may be the most effective way for the FDA to combat antibiotic resistance in the clinical cont ext. REMS restrictions could ensure that antibiotics are only used when appropriate and could prevent physicians from unnecessarily compounding the problem of antibiotic resistance. This outcome may justify any possible concerns regarding physician autonomy. IV.CONCLUSION The chronic misuse and overuse of antibiotics by humans directly contributes to the perpetuation and spread of antibiotic resistance, a growing public health problem with no viable solution in sight. In order to effectively combat antibiotic resistance, a multifaceted approach is most likely to have the greatest impact. The first step to combating antibiotic resistance is to eliminate the addition of sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotic to livestock feed. There are several ways that this can be accomplished. Congress could use legislation to 152 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355-1(a)(2)(A) (Supp. I 2007); see also Evans, supra note 119, at 514 (noting that the \"initial list of REMS generally included drug s with abuse or addiction potential or...severe risks.\"). 153 Evans, supra note 119, at 518 (noting the risks associated with REMS \"at both extremes: when patients are injured through physicia ns' undercompliance with REMS, and when physicians 'overcomply' in ways that deny their patients needed treatments.\"). 154 Id. RESISTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 61 ban the practice, but in order to do so, it must defy the powerful agribusiness lobby and risk political isolation. Punitive damages could be used as a deterrent against the use of antibiotics in livestock feed, but the chances that a lawsuit could survive the many common law hurdles it faces are slim at best. The best hope for halting the use of antibiotics in livestock feed is with regulation. The APA petition process offers a medium by which the scientific community could force the FDA to take action in combating antibiotic resistance. The inappropriate use of antibiotics by physicians must also be addressed in order to effectively combat antibiotic resistance. The FDA's newly acquir ed REMS restrict ion authority offers the best strategy for preventing physicians from prescribing antibiotics when they are not necessary. Finally, we must replace those antibiotics that we have driven to the brink of extinction. By leveraging intellectual property law to provide incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop novel antibiotics, the federal government could begin to replenish a woefully inadequate antibiotic arsenal. Without effective antibiotics, our modern civilization is no better protected against a global epidemic than our ancestors were at the time of the Black Death. We must take action in order to maintain our dominion over microbes. "}
