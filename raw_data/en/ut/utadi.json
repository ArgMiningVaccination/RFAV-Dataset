Inactivated [bacterial](https://www.rxlist.com/bacterial/definition.htm) [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) are sterile biologic that provide [acquired immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/acquired_immunity/definition.htm) against certain bacterial infections. Inactivated bacterial vaccines work by stimulating the body's [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) to produce antibodies against specific types of [bacteria](https://www.rxlist.com/bacteria/definition.htm), and protect a person from becoming infected when exposed to these bacteria. Inactivated bacterial vaccines are made from [proteins](https://www.rxlist.com/proteins/definition.htm) or fragments of [disease](https://www.rxlist.com/disease/definition.htm)-causing bacteria grown [in](https://www.rxlist.com/in/definition.htm) [culture](https://www.rxlist.com/culture/definition.htm) and then killed (inactivated) to prevent them from causing disease. Inactivated bacterial vaccines also contain substances that preserve and stabilize the vaccine, and boost [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm). The main component of inactivated bacterial vaccines is the bacterial [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) against which the [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm) system produces antibodies. If exposed to the particular bacterial [infection](https://www.rxlist.com/infection/definition.htm) later in life, the immune system of the vaccinated person identifies the bacteria by the antigen, attacks and kills the bacteria, preventing illness. Some inactivated bacterial vaccines are conjugated with [tetanus](https://www.rxlist.com/tetanus/definition.htm) or [diphtheria](https://www.rxlist.com/diphtheria/definition.htm) bacterial toxoids to improve the immune response. Toxoids are toxins that are chemically altered to eliminate [toxicity](https://www.rxlist.com/toxicity/definition.htm), but can be recognized as bacterial antigens by the immune system. Inactivated bacterial vaccines do not provide as strong or long-lasting [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) as weakened live vaccines do, but are effective for people with compromised immunity. Inactivated bacterial vaccines provide immunity against the following bacterial infectious diseases: [Anthrax](https://www.rxlist.com/anthrax/definition.htm), caused by [Bacillus anthracis](https://www.rxlist.com/bacillus_anthracis/definition.htm)bacteria - Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) bacterial infection - Meningococcal disease, caused by [Neisseria](https://www.rxlist.com/neisseria/definition.htm)meningitidis bacteria serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 - Meningococcal disease, caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria serogroup B [Pneumonia](https://www.rxlist.com/pneumonia/definition.htm), caused by multiple strains of [Streptococcus pneumoniae](https://www.rxlist.com/streptococcus_pneumoniae_pneumococcus/definition.htm)bacteria - Tetanus, caused by [Clostridium](https://www.rxlist.com/clostridium/definition.htm)tetani bacteria How are inactivated bacterial vaccines used? Inactivated bacterial vaccines may be administered in a series of doses on a prescribed schedule as [intramuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/intramuscular_im/definition.htm) (IM) injections into the [muscle](https://www.rxlist.com/muscle/definition.htm) or [subcutaneous](https://www.rxlist.com/subcutaneous/definition.htm) (SC) injections into the [tissue](https://www.rxlist.com/tissue/definition.htm) under the [skin](https://www.rxlist.com/skin/definition.htm).
