In advising Ministers on air quality, officials need,therefore, to ensure that they have effective processes to gather the evidenceand analyses to develop sound policy proposals. 2 This report uses the development of the second national Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (the Strategy), published in January2000 (Cm 4548), to examine the policy development processes of the Departmentfor Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (the Department) 1,2. It responds to the recent emphasis on modern policy development in government3, and focuses on the Department's processes for developing the Strategy. Introduction 3 Poor air quality is the result of pollution from a range of sources, including motor vehicles, industry, domestic heating and electricity generation. Poor airquality can seriously damage health but improving air quality can impose costson both consumers and industry. The Strategy's purpose is to provide the bestpracticable protection to human health against the risks posed by air pollution,whilst taking into account both the costs and benefits of improving air quality.It seeks to do so by: !adopting air quality standards - which are levels, based on scientific and health evidence, at which pollutants are thought not to pose significant risksto health; !setting air quality objectives - which specify the actual levels below which the Department aims to reduce the concentration of each pollutant by aparticular date. The Strategy includes standards and objectives for eight pollutants. It does not itself include proposals for additional action to improve air quality, though itdoes impose some requirements on local authorities to act in areas of highpollution. Its aim instead is to set practical objectives to which policy makersacross government should have regard when developing other policiesaffecting air quality. 1 The Strategy covers England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and was developed jointly by the Department and the Devolved Administrations. 2 Prior to the re-organisation of Ministerial responsibilities on 8 June 2001, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was responsible for air quality policy and the Strategy.The Department published proposals for updating the Strategy on 17 September 2001, followinga review that drew on the preliminary findings of this report. 3 In September 1999, the Cabinet Office published a report, Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century, which sets out the characteristics of modern policy-making. For further details,see Appendix 3.2executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY 4 The Strategy was the result of a review of an earlier Strategy published in March 1997, and is therefore an updating of an existing policy rather than thedevelopment of a new one. We examined how, in developing the Strategy, theDepartment had: !marshalled the evidence on the effect of poor air quality on health; !assessed the options for setting and delivering air quality objectives; !planned the implementation of the Strategy. The Department acted to obtain the best evidence available at the time on the effect of air quality on health, and hascommissioned work to improve the evidence 5 The Modernising Government agenda4encourages policy-makers to use the best available evidence from a wide range of sources. In adopting air qualitystandards the Department needed to assimilate complicated scientific researchinto the policy-making process. The Department made good use of expert advice when it adopted the air quality standards 6 The Department adopted the air quality standards on the basis of advice from its Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (the Panel), a committee of 13 independentexperts appointed by the Department to assemble and review the relevantscientific and medical evidence, including leading researchers in this field ofmedicine. Both the Panel and the Department also drew on evidence from theDepartment of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants. 7 The Panel's advice was based on the published and peer-reviewed evidence available on, for example, the clinical effects of poor air quality and studies ofthe incidence of related diseases, such as respiratory and cardio-vasculardiseases, in populations exposed to poor air quality. It also drew onunpublished evidence where it considered this to be of an appropriate quality.However, conclusive evidence could not in all cases be obtained. In particular: !The Panel's advice on the air quality standard for particles considered onlythe effect of short-term exposures to particles, but the effect of long-termexposures may be greater. The Department received new evidence from theDepartment of Health's Committee in May 2001 on long-term exposureand is now reviewing the objective for particles. !The Strategy has so far focused on eight pollutants considered by theDepartment to have the most effect on health (see Appendices 1 and 2). TheDepartment is now considering a Panel recommendation for an air qualitystandard for a ninth pollutant - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. !The current air quality standards are based on recommendations made by thePanel between 1994 and 1998. More recent research may provide furtherinformation on the health effects of pollutants. The Panel is, for example,re-examining the standard for 1,3-butadiene in the light of further evidencethat has become available since this standard was adopted in 1994. 5 4 The Modernising Government agenda refers to the Government's aim to modernise public services as set out in the 1999 White Paper, Modernising Government, (Cm 4310) - see Appendix 3 forfurther details. 5 The proposals published by the Department on 17 September 2001 included more stringent air quality objectives for particles, benzene and carbon monoxide and a new air quality objective for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 3executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY The Department drew together evidence on the extent to which actual air quality affected health 8 Over many years, the Department has developed a national network of monitoring sites to measure current levels of air quality. This monitoring confirmedthe need for the Strategy to improve air quality in many areas. For example, in1998, when the Strategy was being reviewed, levels of particles exceeded thestandards at 76 per cent of monitoring sites, nitrogen dioxide at 48 per cent andozone at 16 per cent. And the Department of Health's Committee on the MedicalEffects of Air Pollutants advised in 1998 that it would be prudent to presume thatstatistical associations of air pollution levels and hospital admissions and broughtforward deaths reflect a causal link. On this presumption, it estimated usingpollution data mainly from 1996 that, in that year, air pollution brought forwardup to 24,000 deaths 6and contributed to the causes of a similar number of additional or brought forward respiratory hospital admissions. The Department conducted an evidence-based assessment of the options for setting air quality objectives, but the evidencewas limited in some areas 9 Having adopted health-based air quality standards , the Department needed to consider the options for setting and achieving air quality objectives . The Cabinet Office's guidance Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century encourages policy-makers to assess trends, to explore the cost and benefits of achieving outcomes, and to establish \"what works\". Keystakeholders should also be consulted and involved. The Department used forecasts of air quality to inform the choice of air quality objectives, but more could be done to assess the extent to whichfuture air quality could differ from the levels forecast 10 The Department needed to estimate likely trends in air quality so as to assess the practicality of any objectives that it might set. It contracted AEA Technology todevelop and maintain computer models to forecast air quality for this purpose. 11 Such forecasts may be subject to uncertainty as a result, for example, of mistakes or misunderstandings in the computer models; simplifications withinthe models; and the effect of factors, such as the weather, that affect air qualitybut whose exact impact cannot be predicted in advance. The Department andAEA Technology sought to address these risks by comparing the results of themodelling with measurements of air quality and with the results of similarmodelling carried out overseas. They also forecast air quality under a range ofweather conditions. The Department should, however, have also assessed theextent to which factors other than the weather, such as future levels of car use,could affect the forecasts, and should have made clear in the published Strategythe extent to which future air quality is likely to differ from the levels forecast. 6 The Report was not able to quantify the degree to which deaths or hospital admissions had been brought forward, but noted that it was more likely to be by a few days or weeks rather than monthsor years. 4executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY The Department analysed some of the costs and benefits of achieving the proposed objectives but recognises that more needs to be done 12 Some measures to improve air quality can be self-financing, such as improvements in the efficiency in the use of fuels, but most entail some costs,for example from the installation of equipment to reduce pollution. The 1997Strategy included some assessment of the costs and benefits of improving airquality but the setting of the air quality objectives in the 1997 Strategy was notinformed by cost benefit analysis. Recognising the importance of this type ofwork, the Department made a commitment to undertake such an analysis andin late 1997 established the Interdepartmental Group on Costs and Benefits (theGroup) to do so. 13 In January 1999, the Group published its interim report, which provided the main input to the 2000 Strategy on costs and benefits. Although the Groupconcluded that significant health and non-health benefits would result fromimproved air quality, it was unable to put a monetary value on these benefits,or estimate all of the costs of achieving them. The Department's work on costand benefits therefore influenced the air quality objectives in the 2000 Strategyonly to a limited extent. 14 At the Department's request, the Group established the further work that was required and since January 1999 the Department has commissioned this work,including evaluation of a range of transport and non-transport measures andfurther consideration of the monetary value of health benefits. The Group'sfuture work will be published in conjunction with reviews of individualpollutants. For instance, the Department is now reviewing the particlesobjective and expects to report on the costs and benefits of the measuresneeded to achieve any revised objective. The Department consulted key stakeholders 15 Policy affecting air quality potentially affects many stakeholders (Figure 1) , and the Department used several methods to consult them about the Strategy. In1999, it published a consultation document setting out its proposals for amendingthe 1997 Strategy and inviting comments. The Department received just over 100responses, most of which supported the proposals, although there were somecritical comments, especially about the relaxation of the objective for particles.The Strategy was revised in the light of a number of the comments received, forexample to standardise the units of measurement used for the pollutants. 16 The Department consulted other government departments and the Devolved Administrations through an interdepartmental working group, and established theAir Quality Forum to consult more than 40 key stakeholders both inside andoutside of government departments. Consultation with other governmentdepartments influenced the policy development in several areas. For example,several departments expressed concerns over the proposed use of 'indicative'targets, intended to be included in the Strategy at tighter levels than the mainobjectives to act as pointers to the future direction policy was expected to take.The Department agreed on the balance of these arguments that they should beremoved to avoid a confusing and potentially misleading number of targets. TheForum helped the Department assess, in particular, the reasonableness andpracticality of its proposals. However, while most Forum members told us that theForum made a worthwhile contribution to the development of the Strategy, somecommented that more use of their expertise could have been made, and that thelarge number of Forum members sometimes hindered constructive debate. 5executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY The Department's proposals for setting air quality objectives were determined by the findings of its policy-making process 17 In assessing options for revising the air quality objectives, the Department took the objectives set out in the 1997 Strategy as the starting point from which itsought to make further progress. For four pollutants, the Department alsoneeded to set objectives that met the requirements of the European Union's1999 Air Quality Daughter Directive 7, although this had little practical impact because the Directive's requirements were essentially no more demanding thanthe objectives set in the 1997 Strategy. 18 The findings of the Department's policy-making process determined its policy proposals for air quality objectives in several ways: !The Department's forecasts of air quality indicated that existing policymeasures would deliver the objectives of the 1997 Strategy earlier thanexpected for at least three pollutants (benzene, 1,3-butadiene and carbonmonoxide) and that the deadlines for achieving these objectives could bebrought forward at minimal cost. !The forecasts indicated that the objective for lead could also be broughtforward, but the Department's Expert Panel on Air Quality Standardsadvised that there would be health benefits in reducing lead levels evenfurther. The Department therefore brought forward the date for achievingthe objective set in the 1997 Strategy and set a more demanding objectiveto be achieved by the end of 2008. 1Key stakeholders with an interest in air quality Government Departments and AgenciesDevolved Administations Local Government Business and Industry Environmental groups Health groups Transport groupsThe DepartmentIn reviewing the Strategy, the Department needed to work with a range of other stakeholders. Source: National Audit Office 7 Directive 99/30/EC!The Department's air quality forecasts, and its work on costs and benefits, indicated that achieving the objectives set in 1997 for nitrogen dioxide andsulphur dioxide would be challenging. The objectives for particles andozone were unlikely to be achievable in all areas without significant costsfrom, for example, restricting industry and traffic. The Department thereforeset a less demanding objective for particles for the time being, andundertook to revisit the objective for ozone, much of which comes from theContinent, in the light of discussion within the European Union on aproposed Directive to limit ozone levels. Figure 2 summarises the changes made to the objectives as a result of this analysis. The Department established arrangements to implement the Strategy and monitor progress 19 Having established air quality objectives the Department needed to ensure that the Strategy was implemented. It also needed to establish processes to allow itto measure, monitor and evaluate progress, to manage risks to the achievementof the aims of the Strategy and to review the Strategy from time to time. 6executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY Changes in air quality objectives between the 1997 and 2000 Strategies This table shows how the air quality objectives changed between the 1997 and 2000 Strategies. Pollutant Change between 1997 and 2000 Strategies Benzene, 1,3-butadiene, Date for achieving levels set in 1997 brought forward by carbon monoxide two years. Lead Date for achieving the level set in 1997 brought forward by one year. A more demanding standard also incorporated as an objective for 2008. Nitrogen dioxide One objective replaced and slightly strengthened by the (two objectives in new European Union target. 1997 Strategy) Ozone No change. Particles 1 1997 objective replaced by less demanding objective based on European Union requirements. Sulphur dioxide No change to 1997 objective, but two new European Union objectives introduced. Note: 1. The Department viewed this objective as a staging post, rather than a final outcome, and will be considering a new, tougher objective in the future. Source: National Audit Office27executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY The Department provided guidance and direction to those responsible for implementation 20 Although some objectives were tightened in the 2000 Strategy, the Strategy did not propose additional policy measures to be taken nationally to improve airquality. It was developed on the basis that existing action would continue. Inparticular, local authorities are required to assess air quality in their areasagainst the air quality objectives, and to draw up action plans to improve airquality where necessary, for example by means of traffic management andplanning controls. Achievement of the Strategy objectives is dependent,therefore, on the implementation of both national and local action. A key riskto the achievement of the objectives is that those responsible forimplementation do not take this action. 21 The Department sought to manage this risk with regard to local authorities by providing guidance to them, for example through policy and technicalguidance notes and helpdesks. It also monitored their submission of air qualityassessments, and commissioned the University of the West of England and AirQuality Consultants to audit the assessments. As a result, most authoritiessubmitted assessments by the end of 2000, as advised by the Department. 22 The Department plans to monitor local authorities' development of air quality action plans, which are advised to be submitted within one year of theirassessments, and to commission audits of these as well. However, authoritiesare required to have regard to the costs, benefits and practicality of action toimprove local air quality, and the Department acknowledges that some will findit very challenging to improve air quality sufficiently to meet all of the airquality objectives in some areas, mainly in London and other majorconurbations. With regard to national action, the Department will continue towork with the Interdepartmental Group which co-ordinates central governmentaction to achieve the air quality objectives. The Department has established effective mechanisms to monitor progress 23 The Department needs to manage two further risks to achievement of the Strategy's aims. One is that inadequate monitoring of air quality may result inthe Department being unaware of emerging air quality trends. The other is thatnew information, or other developments, may render the Strategy out of date. 24 The Department has taken action to monitor progress towards the objectives by: !successful participation in European Union working groups to define objectives in terms that can be measured; !establishing a national network of over 100 air quality monitoring sites, andcommissioning AEA Technology and the National Physical Laboratory toassess and control the accuracy and reliability of the results reported by thenetwork; !commissioning AEA Technology to conduct a review of the number andlocation of monitoring sites against criteria set out by the European Union,which identified a need for 14 additional monitoring sites, and which theDepartment has now installed; !monitoring local authorities' progress in improving local air quality. 8executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY 25 The Department intends to review the Strategy on a rolling pollutant by pollutant basis over the next few years, to take account of the latest healthevidence and modelling. The first such review, of particles, benzene andcarbon monoxide commenced in March 2001 8. The review will take account of further work on the chronic effects of exposure to particles and furthermodelling work, as well as an examination of the costs and benefits ofmeasures designed to reduce emissions of particles. The Department alsointends to evaluate the Strategy in 2001 to consider the reliability of cost andbenefit assessments and the efficacy of different policy mechanisms. Conclusions and recommendations 26 The Department's policy-making processes developed a Strategy that added value to the government's air quality policy in three main areas: !Assurance. The Strategy provided an improved evidence base for air quality objectives and for assessing whether the United Kingdom (UK) was likely tomeet its obligations for improving air quality under European Union law. !A focus for action. The Strategy provided a catalyst for local authority action to improve air quality through policy measures such as low emissions zones,vehicle emission testing and control, and traffic management. !A focus for research. The Strategy helped the Department identify where best to concentrate its work to improve knowledge of the effects ofpollution, current and expected future levels of pollution and of the costsand benefits of improving air quality. 27 The Department's development of the Strategy also provided examples in action of the core competencies identified by the Cabinet Office's Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century report 9as necessary for a fully effective policy-making process (Figure 3) . 28 But we also identified a number of areas where processes might be enhanced, and we therefore make the following recommendations: 1 In its planned review of the terms of reference and membership of its Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards, the Department should : ! In making new appointments to the Panel, include some lay members , as recommended by the Office of Science and Technology in its guidelines10on scientific advice and policy making; and implement the recommendations of its own 1998 review, thatvacancies on the Panel should be advertised and future appointmentsshould be for fixed terms (paragraph 2.9). ! Review the remit of the Panel ; limit values are being set for an increasing number of pollutants by the European Union and theDepartment needs to consider whether there is scope to make greateruse of the Panel's expertise in the future in supporting the UK's inputto policy-making within the European Union (paragraph 2.10). ! Explore with the Department of Health the scope to amalgamate the Panel with the Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, in view of the close links between thesebodies, to help ensure consistent and joined-up advice acrossgovernment (paragraph 2.10). 8 The proposals published by the Department on 17 September 2001 were the result of this review. 9 See Appendix 3, Figure B.10 Guidelines 2000 - Scientific Advice and Policy Making, Office of Science and Technology, 2000.9executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY Examples within the development of the strategy The Department used forecasts based on modelling to assess whether air quality was likely to improvesufficiently to meet proposed air quality objectives orwhether additional measures would be needed. Theseforecasts took into account both the impact of currenteconomic and technological trends and that of existingand planned policies (paragraph 3.4). The Department undertook to keep, but revisit at an early opportunity, the objective for ozone set in 1997 in thelight of discussions within the European Union on theirproposed Directive to limit ozone levels. Much ozonepollution is derived from the Continent and so not readilyamenable to local control within this country (paragraph3.41). The Strategy also took account of limit values in thefirst European Union Air Quality Daughter Directive(paragraph 3.39). The Department made itself open to the comments and suggestions of others through the Interdepartmental Groupand the Air Quality Forum (paragraph 3.30). To produce its reports, the Department's Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards reviewed a wide range of evidencefrom the UK and abroad (paragraph 2.8). The Committeeon the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants adopted a similarapproach when quantifying the effects of air pollution inthe UK (paragraph 2.13). When discussing the proposed objectives, the Department emphasised to the Interdepartmental Group that if futuremonitoring work did indicate that small industrial boilerswere causing local air quality exceedences, no decisionwould be taken to enforce alteration or potential closureof these boilers without future interdepartmentalagreement (paragraph 3.32, first bullet). The Department established the Air Quality Forum to consult with stakeholders from a variety of different socialand economic sectors (paragraph 3.33). It also intends toretain the Interdepartmental Group during theimplementation phase, and expects other Departments toensure that their policies help, if possible, towards theachievement of the objectives and that they consult it onmatters affecting the Strategy (paragraph 4.14). The Department will soon evaluate the work used to support the option assessment process, in particularassumptions made about costs and benefits and theefficacy of policy mechanisms (paragraph 4.23). The Department has started to review the Strategy again on a pollutant by pollutant basis (paragraph 4.22). The Department used pilot exercises to investigate the practical aspects of local air quality management beforeits full introduction (paragraph 4.7).Professional policy making competencies Forward looking: taking a long-term view Outward looking: taking account offactors in the Europeanand internationalsituation Innovative and creative: open to the commentsand suggestions ofothers Using evidence: uses best available evidencefrom a wide range ofsources Inclusive: taking account of the impactof the policy ondifferent groups Joined up: looks beyond institutional boundaries Evaluates: builds systematic evaluationinto the process Reviews: keeps established policyunder review Learns lessons: learns from what works andwhat does notThe Department's policy-making processes and the Professional Policy Making competencies The Department exhibited the core professional policy-making competencies in various ways.310executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY 2 The Department should develop a strategy for improving its knowledge of the health effects of poor air quality . The Department has recognised the need to improve its evidence on the long term effects of particles, and hasasked its expert panel to review new evidence on 1,3-butadiene. TheDepartment of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutantshas advised that there are also shortfalls in the evidence available on theshort and long term health effects of nitrogen dioxide and carbonmonoxide. The Department needs up-to-date and comprehensiveinformation on these matters to ensure that the air quality standards remainappropriate and to assess accurately the benefits of improving air quality.The Department should take stock of the gaps in its knowledge of the healtheffects, realistically assess its ability to improve this knowledge and thevalue of so doing, and draw up a plan and priorities for removing these gaps(paragraphs 2.15). 3 The Department should establish a timetable for regular reviews of the air quality standards . The Department plans to review the Strategy on a pollutant by pollutant basis, focusing primarily on the objectives set foreach pollutant. The first standards were adopted in 1994 and theDepartment needs to ensure that its reviews keep pace with the developingevidence on the health effects of pollutants (paragraph 2.11). 4 The Department should review the extent to which future air quality could differ from its forecasts . AEA Technology has assessed the extent of uncertainty in the estimates of pollution emissions. But the Departmentneeds also to assess the scope for future air quality to differ from theforecasts based on these estimates, to consider, in particular, possiblemistakes or misunderstandings in the computer models; simplificationswithin the models; and the effect of factors, such as future levels of car use,whose exact impact cannot be predicted in advance (paragraph 3.13). 5 In future reviews of the Strategy, the Department needs to do more to communicate and respond to the scope for future air quality to differ fromforecast levels and to incorporate uncertainties into its assessment ofoptions . The Department should ensure that the assumptions made and potential uncertainty in the forecasts are clearly indicated within the Strategy;grade emissions estimates to indicate their reliability; carry out sensitivityanalysis on the potential impact on the Strategy if key assumptions andestimates are wrong; develop a range of scenarios within its modelling to helpassess the scope for air quality to differ from the best-estimate forecast; andinclude in its policy proposals contingency plans for responding todifferences between future air quality and the levels forecast (paragraph 3.16). 6 The Department should consider using multi-criteria analysis to help inform the setting of objectives. The work of the Interdepartmental Group on Costs and Benefits was inconclusive, in part because of the difficulty ofsatisfactorily putting a monetary value on the health benefits of improvingair quality. Multi-criteria analysis is a process for establishing preferencesbetween options by reference to an explicit set of weighted objectives,instead of evaluating all options in financial terms. It has recently beencommended by the Department for use in policy appraisal 11and in view of the Department's difficulties in valuing benefits it may offer a moreconclusive basis for setting air quality objectives (paragraphs 3.21 to 3.25). 11 Multi-Criteria Analysis: A Manual, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2000.11 executive summaryPOLICY DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING AIR QUALITY 7 The Department should seek to make the following enhancements to its consultation processes: ! In future public consultation exercises, report publicly how it has responded to comments received, and why, in line with the Cabinet Office's Code of Practice on Written Consultation (November 2000) (paragraph 3.28). ! Consider how to minimise the burden on consultees , for example by highlighting changes in documents arising from initial consultations,and focusing consultation on issues where there is a decision to bemade (paragraph 3.29). ! Use advertisements to identify potential members of consultative bodies , as well as internal discussion within the Department (paragraph 3.33). ! Although there are merits in including as many stakeholders as possible within the Forum, consider setting up Forum sub-groups on specific issues , to enable stakeholders to make a more effective contribution to the Department's work (paragraph 3.36). 8 The Department should review local authorities' progress in implementing action plans to improve local air quality . Most local authorities have now completed their review and assessments of air quality in their areas and theDepartment is monitoring local authorities' development of action plans toimprove local air quality. However, achieving the air quality objectives willbe very challenging for some authorities, and the Department needs also tomonitor authorities' implementation of their plans and to review localauthorities' achievements in improving air quality (paragraph 4.12).
