We offer a number of IV therapies and they are a great place to start when you want to give your immune system a boost. Intravenous (I.V.) administration of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other natural substances, including hydrogen peroxide, delivers nutrients directly to cells via the bloodstream. Many people suffer from malabsorption and natural supplements may not be delivered to the cells where they are required for health and healing and may simply pass through the stool. I.V. administration of these natural substances bypasses several factors needed for proper cellular nutrition. Malabsorption is very common. 20% of our elderly population do not properly absorb vitamin B12. I.V. administration of the nutrients ensures a high dose delivery directly from the blood to the cells. Many therapeutic benefits of nutrients must be given intravenously to have an effect. For instance, only the I.V. route of administration of vitamin C reaches plasma levels consistent with concentrations demonstrated in vitro to be cytotoxic to several cancer cell lines. Here are the most common naturopathic IV therapies, that we have used for decades, to boost our patient's immune systems. 1. [Myers' Immune Push](https://drceaser.com/winnipeg/myers-cocktail/) Myers Cocktail is a formula containing numerous vitamins and minerals many are lacking. When one takes supplements orally, the amount concentrated in the blood is limited due to intestinal absorption saturation and an increase in kidney clearance. This isn't an issue when the vitamins and minerals are given intravenously. Within 10 to 15 minutes of the push, the user receives these vitamins and minerals in much higher concentrations 2. IV Vitamin C It has long been recognized that Vitamin C offers a variety of health benefits to human beings. It is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes unstable molecules known as free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive because they have an unpaired electron, and are prone to \"stealing\" electrons from nearby stable molecules. This process is called oxidation and is damaging to the body. It is believed by many experts to be responsible for much of ageing. If these unstable free radicals are not neutralized then they are likely to cause mutations that might lead to unwanted conditions such as cancer or circulatory system disorders. Vitamin C works to neutralize free radicals by giving up one of its electrons to repair the unstable molecule, thus preventing it from attacking the body. Vitamin C lowers blood pressure and helps prevent cataracts. It is widely considered to be an effective natural treatment for a number of human illnesses, including cancer. 3. [IV Ozone](https://drceaser.com/winnipeg/ozone-injection-therapy/) Ozone gas disrupts the viral capsid and the viral reproductive cycle by interrupting the virus-to-cell contact with peroxidation. Bacteria are destroyed as ozone first oxidizes their fatty cell wall due to bacteria lacking enzymes to break down peroxide. Ozone inhibits fungal cell growth at certain stages. The FDA and EPA say that ozone destroys 99.9992% of all pathogenic germs and 99.9992% of all pollutants in water. - Ozone enhances immunity. - Ozone improves oxygenation of portal and peripheral blood and possibly of intestinal lymph. - Ozone reduces the volume of herniated disks alleviating nerve root compression and pain. - Ozone is anti-inflammatory and improves the quality of joint surfaces essentially correcting joint disorders, including meniscal tears and arthritis. Ozone's medical effects are profound and many different conditions can be treated using this tremendous naturopathic therapy. 4. [IV H2O2](https://drceaser.com/winnipeg/hydrogen-peroxide-therapy/) Intravenous Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy is an alternative health therapy with a large number of devoted adherents. Advocates of this therapy claim that injecting 3% hydrogen peroxide intravenously via a drip for approximately an hour and a half per session will cure a number of diverse conditions ranging from the common cold to cancer. When hydrogen peroxide comes into contact with blood it reacts with the enzyme catalase, causing it to break down into water as well as into copious quantities of oxygen. Any part of the body that might for any reason have been oxygen-deprived (due to circulatory problems, for example) will benefit from this increased oxygen. In addition, the released oxygen performs a host of helpful actions within the body including the inhibition and/or destruction of a number of anaerobic organisms such as viruses, bacteria and cancer. (Anaerobic organisms are all pathogens.) Additionally, hydrogen peroxide stimulates the body's production of white blood cells, helps to break down calcium deposits within blood vessels, dissolves cholesterol, and converts the waste products and toxins that are the by-products of cellular processes into a form that is easily eliminated Book an appointment or call our office today at (204) 808-3632 to discuss potential treatment options.
