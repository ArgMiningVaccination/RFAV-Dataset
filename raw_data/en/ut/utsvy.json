John Morgan confirmed that Serotonin hydrochloride was available as a salt (human secretion was not available). Helios Homeopathy supplied the substance for the proving and John Morgan assisted with the pharmacy at the start of this proving. The tincture was run up to the 30c Hahnemannian potency in class. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 About Profound and frivolous bonding disintegrates into sensation of isolation. Boiling fire or freezing ice. Angelic protection. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - when Serotonin reserves are depleted connections are impaired - when elevated they are enhanced. An image which captures the spiritual aspect of this connection is that of a winged angel, bringing love, peace and serenity. It is felt as a Divine connection and communication between all beings. When on a high this person will be a hugger; bringing joy and laughter to any gathering of friends and maternal feelings may arise. Conversely, they can feel rejected, unloved and then withdraw. A polarity between ice and fire encapsulates this remedy's mode of action - with symptoms of coldness and heat in both mental and physical spheres. The strong and striking sensations experienced by the provers were shooting, stabbing, tingling, pins and needles, whooshing, wave-like symptoms, fullness and swelling. These were often sudden and fleeting. Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is an important biochemical which is present in all vertebrates, some invertebrates and several food plants such as plantains, bananas, pineapples, walnuts, kiwifruit, plums and fresh tomatoes. It is also present in the defensive stings of sea urchins, some insects and stinging nettles (Urtica dioica), where it acts as an irritant causing pain, burning and inflammation. The essential amino acid tryptophan is the dietary source of Serotonin. High tryptophan foods include meats, fish, tofu, beans, milk, nuts, seeds, oatmeal and eggs, as well as the fruit mentioned above. Even chocolate contains some tryptophan which is converted into Serotonin in the body and can affect mood. Many seeds and fruits which contain 5-HT affect the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the regulation of peristalsis. Serotonin has been known for over 70 years as one of the significant monoamine neurotransmitters and hormones in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. Serotonin is used to transmit messages between nerve cells. As the precursor for melatonin it helps regulate the body's sleep-wake cycles and the internal clock and is thought to serve an overall role in co-ordinating the nervous system. Serotonin acts as a trophic factor (proteins that support the growth, survival and differentiation of neurons) starting soon after conception. This is directly related to the production of Serotonin in the mother's gut and is transferred into her blood platelets. From a very early stage of gestation the foetus also starts synthesizing its own Serotonin in a special group of nuclei of the midbrain. The Serotonin found in the body is synthesized from the dietary essential amino acid tryptophan and occurs mainly in platelets in the cardiovascular system and EC cells in the gut. EC cells are a type of entero-neuro-endocrine cell, which modulate neuron signalling in the enteric nervous system (ENS) via the secretion of Serotonin and other peptides. Neurons responsive to Serotonin in the brain are separated from the peripheral serotonergic neurons, platelets and EC cells because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is impermeable to Serotonin. This means that Serotonin operating as a neurotransmitter in the brain has to be synthesised in situ from tryptophan which can cross the BBB. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 Serotonin is an important enteric signalling molecule and is well known for playing a key role in sensory-motor peristaltic reflexes and secretory functions in the gut. Abnormal concentrations of Serotonin have been associated with IBS, predominantly increased concentrations intensifying gastrointestinal motility and mucosal secretions from the gut mucosa. Severe IBS often manifests as either chronic constipation or chronic diarrhoea and abnormal EC cell populations have been correlated with both conditions. Much research is currently being carried out on the importance of the gut-brain axis in health and Serotonin clearly plays an important role here. In addition, Serotonin has been found to play a role in constriction and contraction of other muscular tissues, such as in bronchioles or in the uterus. Other complex physiological functions of Serotonin include modulation of mood, cognition, learning, reward and memory and it is known as a 'happy hormone' because it is recognised for its power to lift depression, regulate mood and effect happiness. Dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins are the other 3 happy hormones. Serotonin also helps to regulate sleep-wake cycles and suppress appetite. It is necessary for muscle contraction, cognitive function - learning and memory - and plays a role in the autonomic nervous system in maintaining blood pressure, heart and breathing rates, temperature regulation, metabolism, arousal and digestion. High levels of Serotonin can cause diarrhoea, fever, raised heart rate, dizziness, tremors and convulsions. Serotonin syndrome (extra-high levels of Serotonin) can occur as a side effect of some medication and, if not treated, can be fatal. Low levels of Serotonin are associated with depression, fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, migraines, OCD-like behaviour and mood swings. It is also very important in vasoconstriction to prevent blood flow and can induce nausea and vomiting to prevent poisoning. In both modalities (as a neurotransmitter or as a hormone) it operates as an essential communicator chemical. There is a link between Serotonin and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). People can be affected by SAD during the winter months when there is less daylight, causing low mood, lack of energy and disrupted sleep. At rest, Serotonin is stored safely in the vesicles of pre-synaptic neurons located at the synaptic knob. The action potential triggers the release of Serotonin vesicles and they move towards the membrane of the pre-synaptic neuron. The vesicle then binds to the cell surface membrane and Serotonin is released by exocytosis into the synaptic cleft where it moves towards the post-synaptic neuron and binds to the matching receptor sites there, triggering a new action potential. Normally, a neurotransmitter is reabsorbed ('reuptaken') after it has transmitted its neural impulse. Most of the body's Serotonin is found in the gastro-Intestinal tract where it regulates bowel function as well as reducing appetite while eating. If you eat something that is toxic the gut produces more Serotonin to increase transit time and expel the irritant in diarrhoea. Serotonin is released by blood platelets when there is a wound - the resulting vasoconstriction, or narrowing of the blood vessels, reduces blood flow and helps blood clots to form. It also appears to inhibit sexual activity. Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) boost Serotonin levels in people with depression, but between 20% and 70% of people who take them experience a range of symptoms related to sexual dysfunction. In the brain Serotonin plays an important neuro-modulatory role in physiological responses, such as behavioural arousal, circadian rhythmicity, neuroendocrine function, sexual behaviour and feeding. It also plays an important role in mental processes, mood and cognition. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 Serotonin is seen in insect processes in roles similar to the human central nervous system, such as memory, appetite, sleep and behaviour. Locust swarming is mediated by Serotonin, transforming social preference from aversion to a gregarious state that enables coherent groups. Learning in flies and honeybees is affected by the presence of Serotonin. It is one compound of the poison contained in stinging nettles, where it causes pain on injection in the same manner as it does in insect venoms. Mythology Nettle - In Celtic folklore, nettle - 'Devil's claw' - was employed as a threshold guardian to afford protection from witchcraft and sorcery with its sting and perhaps engaging Serotonin light to fight dark magic. Where they grew was thought to indicate the place where fairies lived and nettle stings were thought to provide protection from their magic. Nettle was also used to reduce a fever by chanting the name of the sick individual whilst picking the whole plant - both roots and leaves. The properties of nettle carry the maternal energy of Serotonin. They have been widely used due to their ability to prevent haemorrhaging and stop bleeding from wounds. History Discovery of Serotonin - In 1935 Dr Vittorio Erspamer identified a substance - enteramine - which was first taken from rabbit gastric mucosa, demonstrating the action of enterochromaffin cells in the gut and their involvement in peristalsis. Erspamer continued working with enteramine and through research carried out by Maurice Rapport and his team it was established that both Erspamer and Rapport had identified the same substance, namely 5-hydroxytryptamine. Medical uses Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's - such as Prozac and Zoloft) work by increasing Serotonin levels in the brain. After carrying a message Serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as \"reuptake\"). SSRIs work by blocking (\"inhibiting\") reuptake, meaning more Serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. Recreational drugs Recreational use of MDMA and Ecstacy became popular in the Second Summer of Love in the late '80s to early '90s, at raves, with garage and acid house music. Despite being categorised as Class A drugs in 1988 MDMA and Ecstacy are still used for their pleasure-inducing and hallucinogenic effects. Electronic dance music and the use of MDMA evolved hand in hand. \"If you look at electronic dance music culture, it seems to be more diverse, more accepting of the 'other', more welcoming of gay people\u2014a counter-ethos of 'we're in it together,'\" Dr. Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).... \"There's a spiritual as-pect to it. For many, the drug serves that function. There's something fundamentally wholesome about these communal dance parties.\" The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5 It's not hard to understand why. \"Rolling,\" as the new ravers call the high, is a state of prolonged eu-phoria, intimacy, and kinesis: the conditions encouraged by a pulsing beat, a rococo of colored lights, and a setting that makes rubbing up against dozens of people tough to avoid. The drug makes the music better, and vice-versa. In spite of efforts to commercialize the scene, or perhaps because of them, this truism remains the genre's core. Source: The Atlantic https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/electronic-dance-music-s-love-affair-with-ecstasy-a-history/279815/ When ingested MDMA causes the brain to flood itself with Serotonin, leading to heightened sensitivity where touch and movement become intensely pleasurable. There is also an intense empathetic connection with others, accompanied by rushes of exhilaration, often with nausea, and sometimes an urgent need to defecate. This physical sensitivity, paired with the feelings of self-acceptance and empathy for others, can often lead to an increased sex drive and especially feelings of openness and intimacy. When the effects subside the brain is depleted of much of its supply of Serotonin. Because of this substantial loss depression is a common after-effect of MDMA use. Before MDMA became popular in clubs and raves, it was utilised for therapeutic purposes among mental health practitioners. MDMA-assisted therapy combines traditional psychotherapy with the administration of MDMA. Because of MDMA's unique effect of reducing fear and enhancing interpersonal trust, it can be espe-cially helpful in healing psychological and emotional damage from traumas, helping the terminally ill face death, and other difficult-to-treat psychological conditions. MDMA has reportedly been used with over 1,000 human subjects in clinical trials without a single serious adverse event. When the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sought to completely prohibit MDMA in the 1980s, the medical community protested and the DEA's own administrative law judge ruled that MDMA should not be placed in Schedule I. However, the DEA ignored this ruling and medical research was shut down for almost two decades. Over the past decade, however, there has been a resurgence in research evaluating MDMA's therapeutic benefits, especially regarding treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A seminal study published in 2011 found that patients who received MDMA-assisted psychotherapy reported substantial reductions in the severity of their PTSD symptoms. These findings have been replicated by other studies, and additional research is underway in the U.S., Canada, and Israel and soon to begin in the U.K. and Australia.

For one prover light was a key manifestation of the proving. She wrote, 'The most significant of my delusions was that I was an angel. These delusions were so real that even now ... a part of me feels as though it is true. The first time I was sitting quietly, meditating, not on anything in particular, just sitting quietly. I felt the wings come out of my back and open up, and I stood up, I was holding a sword and sceptre and there was light beaming out of my chest. I was fierce and powerful, a protector, and my feeling was, \"Don't mess with my people\". After some time, I felt the wings fold back into my back, I had the physical sensation of this, and in the opposite place on the front of my body, the light continued to beam out of me.' Connection was described as continuing 'like a golden thread' through the proving, with provers reporting oneness, an intensity of sound and colour, bonding, a sense of unification, attachment and wanting to be mothered and hugged; also needing to regress and be childlike. This was expressed by a prover, saying, 'My mum came in so loud were my sobs. My baby had a night terror at exactly the same time. When tried to get back to sleep, it was unreal how cold I was. Completely covered and shivering ... Like there's no hope. Felt really alone. Like my own 1 year old was forsaking me. If my mum hadn't come in, I would've just carried on crying. We don't normally hug very much. When someone gives you a really nice hug, you kind of disintegrate.' High levels of Serotonin bring loving feelings and elation, which provers experienced as frivolity and fuzziness: ' We were completely giddy, high, silly, out of control'. The mood swings of Serotonin were likened to a 'rollercoaster' ride: 'I started off on a high with such clarity and joy. Then the next thing I knew there was a complete change in direction; I hit rock bottom. I became tearful, emotional and very low - symptoms that I normally get when having bouts of my depression were dominant. I wanted to sit on [the] sofa and do nothing, speak to no-one, not do any housework or cook. Everything was such an effort. I was irritable with everyone and my tolerance level was so low that I had altercations and spoke my mind.' At rock bottom was disconnection, isolation, and feeling unloved. Low Serotonin levels can cause insecurity and a sense of rejection - bringing a greater desire for physical bonding and inhibiting sexual activity. These aspects of the substance emerged in the proving as despondency, with provers comfort-eating due to a loss of will power, developing self-esteem issues, and becoming chaotic.

The moment I took the remedy, it was like an instant come down, I suddenly felt very sombre and serious. Within this handful of minutes, the preparation and the actual taking of the remedy, I experienced two significant polarities of the remedy state - the high and the low which I would experience again during the two months of the proving to a greater or lesser extent. The other really significant feeling that came up within the first few minutes of taking the remedy was the desire for connection and the feeling of disconnection. This polarity was the core of my experience of Serotonin. The following evening I found myself in a bubble of love with a couple of my classmates, able to express for the first time in how I have felt outside of my group since V left at the end of the first year. I felt a level of connection and love that I can only compare to the feeling when the boundaries are torn down from being in a drug-induced state, specifically MDMA. There were no barriers between us, we were able to see and feel each other's essences, we were one. Connection continued like a golden thread through the proving. I had many unexpected moments with various people in my daily life where I was able to fully see and be seen and to truly know what \"oneness\" or \"no separation\" means. These are such buzz words in the spiritual seeker's community but I don't think that, until now, I fully understood or had experienced it beyond momentary glimmers. This feeling did not apply only to people, but also to the world around me - everything was \"more\", as if I could feel the vibration of all things. Colours we more intense, sounds too, but it was not only on the outside, the energy of it all was felt within me too. Of course, the flip side of this was that there were experiences of utter disconnect as well. I had the most absurd argument with my husband, it was as if we were speaking across the void of the universe in languages from other planets. And the premise of the argument was so completely tiny and stupid. Thankfully, I was fairly quickly able to understand that it was proving-related and laugh about it and let it go. The same day I also experienced complete disconnect from my daughter. Connection and disconnection played a huge role in my dreams as well. Unusually, I dreamt every single night of the proving. This is where a lot of the more \"negative\" side of the remedy picture came through, whereas I had a lot of the more \"positive\" experiences in my waking life, including some truly magical delusions. The most significant of my delusions was that I was an angel. These delusions were so real that even now (in spite of my rational homeopath's mind), a part of me feels as though it is true. The first time I was sitting quietly, meditating, not on anything in particular, just sitting quietly.

After some time, I felt the wings fold back into my back, I had the physical sensation of this, and in the opposite place on the front of my body, the light continued to beam out of me. This was such an intense and incredible experience. I had a second angelic delusion whilst at my daughter's school for her class assembly for Remembrance Day. I was extremely moved by the children's words and when it came to the two minute silence I felt my wings come out again and enfold all the people in the hall, holding them in love, in light and in safety. It was a much softer experience of the angel energy I experienced before and it felt beautiful. Both in my dreams and in my daily life light played a big part. The feeling that I am light, that light is coming out of me, that I am somehow glowing, that people can see and recognise the light in me, that I can see it reflected in them. This ties in with the feelings of connection. Responsibility came through in my dreams as a major theme. Most often I seemed to be responsible for large groups of children, but on the flip side I seemed unable to do the right thing for my own children. There was a lot of running away, of being unsafe. I also had a couple of dreams around child abuse - I was the child or the innocent in my dreams. The one that stays with me the most is the one where I had to bury my child-sized bike and that I had no one to protect me. In a way, this is also the polarity of state of having no boundaries. On the one hand it is possible to experience connection at an unfathomable level; on the other no boundaries also means no protection and vulnerability. Of course, the flip side of this was that there were experiences of utter disconnect as well.

On the one hand it is possible to experience connection at an unfathomable level; on the other no boundaries also means no protection and vulnerability. Time behaved differently during the proving and this came through again both in my dreams and in my waking life. I had one experience of literally losing 45 minutes in the blink of an eye - and I was not alone, which made it all the weirder. There was absolutely no explanation for this. I often had the feeling of time running out. There were a lot of tears during the proving. Both happy tears and sad tears. There were times when I felt like I was channelling the sadness of the whole world through me. Sometimes it was crying for no reason at all. But it did feel really cleansing. This is a list of the most significant physical symptoms that I experienced whilst proving Serotonin: UTI (immediately, the morning after taking the remedy) Period pains and disruption to my menstrual cycle Dry throat and mouth with increased thirst Sore throat Cough COLD (temperature) Headaches Pain in neck and shoulder (particularly RHS) The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 11 Tiredness Thinness of fingernails which broke very low and painfully I think there is a wet//dry polarity around the mucous membranes as more than once I felt my throat or lungs stick together and also I had a watery runny nose. I really loved proving Serotonin and it was almost with regret that I let it go. Although I had been really excited to find out what it was, and high as a kite in the lead up to the big reveal and the closing ceremony, the whole thing felt like an epic come-down. I really wanted to keep riding the wave of energy, love and connection. Instead, I actually wanted to leave the party, to be by myself. I always want to dance, but this time it felt like such an effort. Thankfully, the Monday after college I had one final, beautiful sSerotonin day for myself: I was walking around town and felt as if my heart had been cracked wide open and the light was beaming out. I literally felt as if I was glowing and surely everyone could see it! I felt love and connection towards everyone I saw - I wish I could always feel this way.'

It was nice, enjoying it. Day 1 - Provers speaking as one Coordinator's observation - Atmosphere - camaraderie, relaxed, fun, giggling, raucous laughter Woke at 3.33am and cried in a way that I felt like - so desperately low - overwhelming feeling that everything was fucked and wouldn't have been ever better. I felt really low. My mum came in so loud were my sobs. R (baby) had a night terror at exactly the same time. When tried to get back to sleep, it was unreal how cold I was. Completely covered and shivering. Really, really, intense! Like there's no hope. Felt really alone. When baby has her night terrors, she doesn't recognise me. She scrambles past me, going 'mummy, mummy, mummy' it's quite alienating. It's like even she doesn't give a shit. Like my own 1 year old was forsaking me. If my mum hadn't come in, I would've just carried on crying. We don't normally hug very much. When someone gives you a really nice hug, you kind of disintegrate. Felt like I was losing it. I was just crying - some attention for me. Not focusing entirely on the baby, that was nice. I needed that... Cold. Yesterday I was freezing all day long before we took it. 7 layers on and wrapped up. Ankles were exposed. Only part of me exposed apart from my face. I am never, ever, ever, cold. I can go out without a jacket. Cold all day, in the evening had a massage. Everything was boiling, and the hot stones were boiling. But my feet were freezing. 'my feet feel like ice blocks, like not my own, disconnected and cutoff at ankles. Like blood going down but missing out my feet. Saw my feet as being like the feet in a morgue. Horrible sensation- as if my feet were not my own. Dream - phoned someone in work. No, they phoned me. I picked up. They were talking about me in the background. Ah, she never picks up her phone... What is she doing?! Really odd how they were talking about me. Don't normally have paranoias about me. Talk about sexual abuse. Feeling like that is not true what they're saying, and they know that. Why are they saying that? The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 14 Time - since the last wknd in college until now... I am having this slow theme going through everything. Slow digestion, slow time, period slow, slow in work ... Other people noticing the time... Been a bit wonky. Also have icy cold feet. Had to go straight to my room and put my fluffy slippers on. Woke up this morning with intense period pains, made me have to get up out of bed. Had symptoms of a UTI, with blood and a shooting pain up the bladder. Lying in bed... Eurgh... More intense than usual. The UTI is not something that is common at all. I panicked a bit to be honest. Quick talk with A and been into Stroud to get meds. Wavering in the middle with whether or not to medicate it. Feel a bit stoned or a bit high - a bit buzzy. Constantly aware of a vibrating energy in all my body. Both nice and overwhelming. Going out into Stroud was all a bit too much. I am feeling like this, and everybody else isn't... Now it comes in a bit of a wave of intensity... breathing. Crying... It wasn't despair, it was overflow, bubbling up of something that has to come out of somewhere. Couldn't make a decision. Stood in the shop, trying to decide which cake to buy. I know what I want normally... but now I am just wooooooo... HG. Woke up in night because very thirsty. (N- woke in the night and felt parched). Awake on and off from 5.30am (Uncommon). Fuzzy, stoned, buzzy feeling. Struggling to put letters together and all got the munchies. Period pains since 1pm today. Not on period so just finished. Because I am on day 8, Having a lot of cramping. Dragging down sensation on both sides of womb. Was right then moved to left. Having lots of shooting pains- a bit like a string around right knee, up my thigh. Pain in back that lasted couple hours. (Shooting pain in hip and left temple - S). Like needle sharp feeling. Shooting, lightning temple pain. V.V. Cold- shivering- full body- as if goosebumps everywhere. Felt like sitting in an icy bath. Boasting about new shoes that are thermal. Feel like regressing- really strong desire to suck my thumb this morning. In fact I did, secretly behind my scarf. Felt like a child, and started crying- but not knowing why. Wanted to be mothered. Felt... It was actually quite a nice feeling. Like I was able to be child-like. Backache - like a dull ache. Felt like a schoolgirl, giggling a lot. Alternating with crying. Leading up to proving, I have been really OK, chilled, happy to go with this. Since taking it, have been feeling like - shit, what have I done? My principles are yogic, so don't take anything ever. Each homeopathic remedy has given me something and left something behind. Frightened, apprehensive that going to be left with something can't get rid of. Almost left me in tears. The slightest noise is pissing me off. I can't deal with noise ++. Cold hands on and off constantly. Not regret, but... One side of me is kicking myself for doing this. Goes against my lifelong principles. Other side thinking what am I going to be left with. Any answer is not going to be adequate. Whatever answer I am getting is freaking me out. Think I am going to be left with something. Frustrated with myself for going against my principles. I just don't take anything ever. Now I am panicking that this is leaving me with something. Neck problem from one of the remedies- it's gone down from the neck to the shoulders. Tender and sore. Become a feeling of pressure. Maybe heel problems better? The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 15 After we had done the meditation and going and buying the bottle of wine. I talked myself out of that. So I didn't - and went back to the B&B. Landlady had left me my supper. She left me a note saying there is a bottle of wine with your name on. Like a little girl - like doing something really naughty. Really giddy over this wine. She said have you taken those pills today - you look a bit spaced out, like you're high. Like 2 little schoolgirls giggling in the corner. We were really excluding him (the landlady's husband).

Woke up and as if I am still spangled. Feel connected when I am outside. Everything nice and vivid. But when come back inside I feel disconnected. My focus is off. Can't pull myself into the room. I had the mum thing. It was a horrific drive home. Aquaplaned a couple times. Got home to dog and felt overwhelming feeling that wanted to cwtch. Felt so alone, nobody was there. For that to creep up on me felt so intense. We are not going there again. The other thing - with my daughter, she has broken her phone again. Said - I have not got the money to repair it.

It's really big, a mansion, in north London where I grew up. The house is configured around a central space with stairs spiralling up and around to 5 or 6 floors, the ceiling height of the central room goes right to the top of the house and there are incredible hanging plants which reach all the way down to the floor for 6 ceiling heights above. the house belongs to a school friend of mine in the dream, I think it was my friend Olivia who I knew at primary school in London, her dad was one of the lawyers to the Queen and her house always really impressed me when I was little, as did her Dad. In the dream I'm pretending to be 'X' to the people who work at her house and for some reason they're believing me. I feel really happy to be accepted but also really nervous about her brothers coming home and realising I wasn't her. Suddenly her two older brothers come home from a Bat Mitzvah and they're comparing party bags and I'm hiding behind the sofa in this room which the 6xheight ceiling. One of them spots me and shouts and I have to run! I get the feeling it's something I do a lot to that family and I used to be really accepted by them but I wanted to be a proper part of their family so much that I went too far with pretending to be 'X' so I fell from being a family friend to a pest who they didn't want to know.

I just can't find my centre and I felt like something bad is coming. I've often had such a feeling in the past but not for a year or so, I used to wake up daily with this feeling of dread but it went through homeopathy and counselling... I feel annoyed that this feeling has returned because it's so dominating and I thought I'd beaten it.

Desire for connection but feeling disconnected. 3 47 1500 ns Disconnect with husband and daughter. 4 3 16.14 NS The most clear and vivid part of my dream was the amazing plant growing in the hotel room at the end of the bed. The really long stems were uneven in texture and covered in extremely sharp thorns. Quite high up they became very leafy - the leaves were small and light green to pink. It grew quite twisty and seemed a very strange choice for the bottom of the bed (it covered the whole wall). My friend was letting me stay for a while because I needed a break (from my life). I would sit for ages in the hotel lobby watching all the comings and goings - it was huge and busy, it felt like an airport. I felt isolated and disconnected from everyone. 4 9 XX.XX NS Dream - about the passing on of knowledge. The apprenticeship was a lonely, isolated role though (disconnection). They would be left alone in the woods for the masters to collect as everyone watched secretly to see what would happen from the bushes. There were a lot of rules, but it was really difficult to come by all the information as \"the powers that be\" were not keen on being transparent. The main feeling for me was frustration. I wanted to do the right thing but I didn't have enough information. 4 10 XX.XX NS Dreamt that I returned as a student to a school that I had been away from for years. I tried talking to people and making friends but they just wouldn't let me in. I remained a total outsider. 4 11 XX.XX NS Dream - I was going to get married to the son of a wealthy family. They did not approve. All of the wedding stuff that they produced was full of photos and information about the family and the guests but there was nothing about me at all. It made me feel like an unwelcome outsider. I was passing the time leading up to the wedding diving in the sea to collect something. But when I dived all I found was stacks of empty rotting animal hutches. I met someone down there who was moving and speaking as if on dry land. He looked at me like I was really weird for not being able to be as he was. Total disconnect, very strange. 4 12 XX.XX NS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 30 I can't remember my dream very well but I know there was a strong birthday theme (in real life it is my daughter's birthday today). There was a sense of disappointment, of things never being quite right or as people wanted them to be. A gap in the understanding and expectations. Disconnect. 4 13 XX.XX NS Dream - What I woke up remembering from my dream was that one friend was being shamed by another for still carrying big feelings about a miscarriage she'd had years ago. It felt unfair that she should be shamed for that - she had carried that baby to term and gone through labour. That is not something you ever get over. But somehow, though I felt that strongly, I couldn't find my voice to fully stand up for her. Disconnection from my power. 4 18 XX.XX NS The first part of my drive home was really scary - it was dark and foggy and I felt like I could be on any road going anywhere - no way of knowing where on earth I was (complete disconnect). It was a relief to get onto the busy main road and motorway and back to civilisation (connection).

Just wanted to sit and listen quietly, take it all in. Felt slightly removed, disconnected but fully aware of lesson. 7 1 15.14 NS Dream - connection and disconnection. I was part of a group that worked in some kind or organising, like a cool version of a town planner. Sometimes we were so connected and creative and in the flow and all would go right. Other times it was completely the opposite - no connection, everything going wrong, everything difficult. 4 6 XX.XX NS Dream - I was travelling but in another world in the equivalent of 3rd world countries.

People kept talking and interrupting and it just couldn't get going. I felt really frustrated. Later on, there were multiples of each person, alive at the same time as a child, a young adult and a middle-aged person. Someone wanted to get rid of these abominations, but each of their selves had to die at exactly the same moment or they just popped back into existence.

The dream was as follows. Dreamt that my three guinea pigs escaped from their hutch, running away under the hedge and fence into next door's garden. I managed to get them to come back to their hutch but they're not happy, they're cold. I'm worried I'm going to lose them and I know that they don't want to live here anymore as they don't like it, because they don't like me. I'm in Sweden or Scandinavia, touring around a big house with paintings and crafts in large castle rooms. The atmosphere is welcoming and calm. I had to do an assault course The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 33 with my family which we did silently. I didn't think I could do it but I went across a plastic/long beanbag across a high drop to the floor where there were crash mats. People outside the castle were saving overturned boats and exploring the arts and crafts. I thought I'd got on well with one of the women at the castle but she rang me up to tell me that she doesn't like me because I'm full of rage and anger. As she said this I realised who she was, the goddess Gaia, Mother Earth, and felt devastated. I felt hurt by Gaia as I thought we'd got on well and that she might be a friend. Everyone at the castle was calm, gentle, kind, low voiced but they didn't like me. I didn't fit in. Felt sad, rejected, ugly. 11 1 x NS Felt extremely low, disappointed, despondent, hurt, rejected and unloved, especially by those closest to me. I cried when I woke up and again in the evening.

Feel like regressing - really strong desire to suck my thumb this morning. In fact I did, secretly behind my scarf. Felt like a child, and started crying but not knowing why. Dream: all of a sudden, my mum steps out of car -see her crystal clear. She came up and hugged me. She was really tiny. All I wanted to do was keep holding her . . . Mum had come out on remand from prison -trying to clear her name . . . Wanted to be mothered. Little girl - wanting to be looked after. Attached to the kids so much that I feel really afraid of leaving them. Giving hugs to people. Urge to come out of bathroom in bra and knickers and bond with the girls. Started baking, which I have never done. I want my baby to have the experience of baking. Maternally linked. A nest. The smell of the baking, warmth of home and children to have that memory . . . Woke at 3.33am and cried in a way that I felt so desperately low - an overwhelming feeling that everything was fucked and wouldn't have been ever better. I felt really low. My mum came in so loud were my sobs. My baby had a night terror at exactly the same time. When tried to get back to sleep, it was unreal how cold I was. Completely covered and shivering. Really, really, intense! Like there's no hope. Felt really alone. Like my own 1 year old was forsaking me. If my mum hadn't come in, I would've just carried on crying. My mum and I don't normally hug very much. When someone gives you a really nice hug, you kind of disintegrate. Felt like I was losing it. . . Like I was able to be child-like. Want to go back to B&B. I feel looked after there. Like a mum! That's what I need so I am going to go back there. . . Dream - funeral of friend from school - her mum. Old school friends there. Was just there - all of a sudden, my mum steps out of car - see her as crystal clear. She came up and hugged me. She was really tiny. All I wanted to do was keep holding her. Mum had come out on remand from prison - trying to clear her name. Eating chocolate, on a lawn. Little girl - wanting to be looked after. Attached to kids- so much so that feel really afraid of leaving them. More overly affectionate to people I wouldn't be. Giving hugs to people. Normally quite a private person but I had this urge to come out of bathroom in bra and knickers and bond with the girls. Bought loads of brown clothes. Suddenly wanted to cry like a child (whilst in a store). Strange feeling. I don't want to go home. Sort the dog out, don't want to see the kids. Didn't want to go home to my kids. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 34 Daughter will not leave my side. It's like she is attached to me again. Doesn't want to go to school, wants to be with me every second of the day. Always wants to touch my skin. Wants to sleep only with me. Not keen on her father. This theme is usual for her, however it has a massive intensity to it during these last few months. 5 xx INS Having had a day of wanting to nod off, I decided to try an early night. When in bed sleep did not come, still awake until around 11.300. I was thinking how the day had gone, all the different things other students had felt during the day. The feelings of wanting Mum hugs, this struck a chord with me as my Mother wasn't forthcoming in that area. In fact, it was always an arms-length relationship with both Mum and Dad. Which is why I tend to Mother other people now, having missed that in my childhood. When others were having meltdown moments and bursting into tears, it was difficult not to start crying myself, feeling their emotion. 1 2 20.30 NS It was a restless night, waking up numerous times to urinate (normal) but my brain wouldn't shut up! There were many things on my , from the hedge trimming, leaves, homework, friend coming to stay. I wonder why some people seem to sail through getting their tasks done, while others struggle, what is the motivation factor that's missing? I've heard that those who have had nannies as children are less inclined to be good employees, less inclined to get work done. Yet two of my siblings are so active you would be put to shame. And all of us were cossited by nannies. I didn't come to any conclusions but the mind has had a thorough bashing to get a grip! 1 5 xx.xx AS Went to run a bath and there was a baby spider in there, I would usually send it down the plughole but I thought to myself that it was a baby so it needed to be saved! 10 2 19.35 NS I really wanted a cwtch from N, she gave me such a good cwtch and I could feel the emotion building up and I cried. I felt warm, loved and safe in her arms. 10 2 11.3 NS I have a sudden strong urge to bake with my eldest daughter which is something I never do and it feels really important that we get it right and create a special memory, like time is passing very quickly and soon she will be leaving home and I'll miss my chance to spend time with her (she's 6). It's very irrational but i feel overcome with the emotion of her leaving me one day!! 3 7 10:00 NS My eldest daughter, is supposed to be going to her dad's for three days this half term but I have a really intense feeling she shouldn't and needs to stay at home with me and the baby. I usually look forward to her visiting her Dads as it only happens once or twice a month but this time I just dread it. I usually feel anxious before and wish she wasn't going but this time I act on it and cancel, which is unusual. I feel like she needs to stay in her nest. 3 10 20:00 IOS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 35 Wake with the strong desire to bake again and tidy the house so I set to work mixing the cake, I make orange polenta cake, and while its baking I totally blitz the house and really want the heating on so its very cosy. 3 13 8:00 RS My boyfriend has never met my eldest daughter's Dad before. They have hated each other from a far and it has been SUCH HARD WORK being between them, making sure they never cross paths etc etc. Usually I would focus way too much on appeasing my boyfriend and respecting his feelings but instead I do NOT CARE about his thoughts about not coming and only care about the girls and how essential it is they aren't separated on her birthday to appease the men. So I really put my foot down, and felt zero guilt which I normally would. I just focussed purely on the kids... and it all worked out fine!! the men met and it was totally fine. 3 36 xx.xx NS Dream - I was working hard to try to bring down a group of corrupt politicians. I had to persuade people who were afraid to speak to me and give me their stories and their evidence. My mum was worried for my safety and wanted me to let it go, but I was determined. There were scenes of kids being chased by baddies who were trying to kill them. I was buried alive in the desert and every time I dug myself out I would sink in again like it was quicksand. It was a horrifying fight for my life. 4 50 XX.XX NS Mother called. Had been drinking and upset. Normally I'm instantly angry and shouty. Today I was calm and listened. I hardly said a word, but said it was ok and I would still help her. The conversation felt like the end for her. Following the conversation I began to cry and then weep. Two main thoughts; I can't help her, and I wish she could hear me. She said she is not the 'looking after' type. She did give me a lot though. She has made me who I am. I have given as good as I got. I have the sense of separation, like it's ok to separate. I can be a person not her daughter. It's a calm sadness. But it is very sad. I can't fix it, I can't heal her pain. 5 1 12.15 NS Was flabbergasted at a colleague that's not usually affectionate hugging another colleague as she was cold.

I just want to go back into my dream and hug my Mom, she was so small in it, tiny. 7 1 xx.xx NS Delusion; voices, hears I was on police patrol with N from the class when I spotted my son walking down the middle of a main road. I pointed him out to Nina and said we had to save him. As we approached him he fell down a hole. When I got to the hole, it was like a skip under the road. L (as a small boy) was down there shouting mummy mummy please save me. 9 2 early hours NS Vaguer dream detail than before - involved one of Lewis's friends who he has known from being in nursery - Benedict. B had some how been cheating in some important exams and had been found out. I was discussing this with Lewis and was expressing my view that it was because he hadn't had good mothering. 9 4 early hours NS Decisive in a self focussed way. I'm going to stay at Mandy's all weekend and enjoy the relaxation and lack of responsibility and 'being looked after'. 9 0 178 mins NS Spent a long time talking about my mother and how I wasn't mothered by her. I mother her rather than the other way around. Felt sad, angry and wish things could have been different. It seems very unfair. 11 4 20 NS One of the fellow students asked if I was alright. She said I looked like a little girl. I said no, I wasn't alright. Another student invited me to sit in her chair. I sat under a blanket, up to my chin, and cried briefly, I don't really know why. I'd found the morning's teaching challenging and felt full of self-doubt. Have I done the right course? Should I have studied something else instead? Although it is normal for me to experience self-doubts, it is unusual for me to cry, especially in front of other people (there were five others in the room). I felt like a little girl and just needed to let it out. My fellow student brought me a cup of tea and a biscuit. It was lovely, as I felt cared for and looked after. I felt little and small as well as a bit silly. Then started giggling and laughing. 11 1 14 NS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 37 Was flabbergasted at a colleague that's not usually affectionate hugging another colleague as she was cold.

The clearing, as the meditation progressed to feeling the light shine down on us, I envisaged a powerful beam of bright white light, as I looked down the top of a large pink sphere with fissure engulfed by gas-coloured flames, ranging from electric blue to orange and yellow, mesmerising. 1 57 18.30 NS In meditation i sprouted wings and became an angel. A powerful one with huge wings and light beaming out from my chest and a sword in my hand. I was the protector and my message was \"don't mess with my people\".

The two places are equal and opposite. 4 6 XX.XX NS Went to attend my daughter's class assembly on Remembrance. I was really touched by what the children shared and it made me tearful again.

It makes my heart swell in love. 4 Calmness / grounding / contentment During an exchange with my friend and parenting expert, when I was consciously moving into pain and sadness, after not much time I came out the other side of the feeling into a real peaceful and energetic state.

It was beautiful. 4 7 13.42 NS Liked being in the calm room, during meditation I saw a golden dog with quite a pointy nose.

I know what I want normally. . . but now I am just wooooooo. . . The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 43 Abuse I had a horrible dream. At first I was a diamond thief, and I stole three expensive diamonds, I was in a city maybe Hong Kong. I decided to cover my tracks I would go to the cinema, I arrived at 11.55pm and there was a showing of the film I wanted to see at 12.01 so I went and bought two tubs of chocolate caramel ice cream and lots of chocolate and popcorn and went into the film. The staff were really nice to me, and when the police stormed into the theatre I was really ashamed and embarrassed that the staff who served the popcorn etc saw that I was a thief. Next I was walking arm in arm with a friend, not sure who, down a clearing between lots of trees, under a big monument statue with a chimney on top. Something told me a part of the chimney was going to fall and as I looked up, there was a huge rock of plummeting towards me, it fell just a step in front of me and a part broke off and hit my head. Next I was watching the dream instead of being the person in it, but the person I was watching was me, although it didn't look like me. There was the girl who had suffered the head injury, she was blonde and late teens. She was lying on her bed in a grand house and she was naked, it was daytime. I remember being quite shocked she was naked, because her father walked in. she looked at him with a nervous smile and he asked her if her head was better and she said yes but that makes me worried about you...Then the father said something reassuring like there's nothing to worry about. The next scene was the girl in a cellar, I knew it was the same house, and she was tied up in a bondage style way and her father was having sex with her. I was watching it in the dream like a film and I felt so overwhelmed with disgust I tried to turn it off somehow but instead it just sped up, showing more and more scenes of the abuse and then another man was there too...all I could think was how much I wanted to kill the men and I thought of her poor head having just recovered from this injury. All of a sudden I was in a different house, with my kids, preparing to go out and trying to finalise details of where I was going with my childminder. I didn't feel the kids were safe with just her though so I got another childminder to come round and be with her too. Then I left but immediately rang my boyfriend and asked him to go home and help the childminders with the girls. I was paying so much for the extra help but I felt convinced the girls wouldn't be safe otherwise. Then I was on a beach, with my friend who's a hairdresser and we were at the checkout of a beauty shop which was on the sand and she was making me pay for all this hair dye which wasn't for me. I felt angry about it but didn't dare say anything. All the time I was thinking about the girl in their basement and how I had to free her somehow. Then I woke up!! Now I feel dazed, disgusted and a bit traumatised. The sexual element of her relationship with her father does kind of make sense to me slightly in the way that I've never met my dad, and when I was younger I remember feeling uncomfortable when my friends Dad's would be around, I felt like they were predatory, especially one incident when I lived with my best friend in a flat when I was 20, and her dad came over and she was in her underwear and she sat on his lap and gave him a cuddle, and I was really disturbed by it I felt like it was a secret signal that there was something going on between them, I couldn't judge what was normal or not because I had no frame of reference. I've also always struggled to believe any relationship I might have with a man isn't related to some sort of condition of sex, because I haven't had many or any platonic relationships with men, like the one between a father and daughter, there's always a price to pay so to speak. 3 3 00.00.00 ns The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 44 In my dream I was being groomed (child abuse).

I had such a strong sense in the dream that if I didn't do as i was told, my mum and daughters would be really harmed so I just did whatever they said.

In the 10 mins meditation, saw an image of water splashing off a roof over a gutter catching the light, it could also have been a small stream, splashing over a rock. I saw each drop of water as it caught the light. Then my mind was seeing shapes that formed into an eye - it was pig like, small with pink skin around flat surface not like an eye socket - the eye retina was a pale jade colour but there was no pupil, just solid jade, almost like someone who is blind but not. Then the image of a left eyebrow, close up to see the hairs, which were dark. I then formed an image of a red circle with a halo of orange around it, the red turned to purple which then formed into swathe of colour coming out of the circle becoming purple totally in field of vision. Just as we were coming out of the meditation my thumbs that were pressing together had a strong pulse. 1 0 12.00.00 NS Having had a day of wanting to nod off, I decided to try an early night. When in bed sleep did not come, still awake until around 11.30. I was thinking how the day had gone, all the different things other students had felt during the day. The feelings of wanting Mum hugs, this struck a chord with me as my Mother wasn't forthcoming in that area. In fact it was always an arms-length relationship with both Mum and Dad. Which is why I tend to Mother other people now, having missed that in my childhood. When others were having meltdown moments and bursting into tears, it was difficult not to start crying myself, feeling their emotion. 1 2 07 .12. NS I was very irritable at coffee break, the biscuits were not out ready! Felt very annoyed as the lady who was behind the counter knew we were there and was slowly putting out the cups and obviously taking her time. After about 10 mins waiting I'd had enough and went through to the kitchen. Luckily I didn't burst in all guns blazing, and composed myself to ask nicely for our biscuits. Success, so I felt glad I was able to resolve everyone's hunger pangs without causing a scene. It was quite amusing, felt like being back at school, banging table to show disgust! 1 2 09.36. NS I went to a garden centre with a friend, there were wooden trough like items for sale, thinking of something that I could use to feed the sheep. It was quite expensive and was for a ladder like plant arrangement. The image of us all wanting food at the weekend like sheep about to be fed came to mind! 1 3 07 .12. NS Hard to get motivated today. Tasks seem to be overwhelming. Feel as though I need to give myself a good shaking. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 56 1 4 10.48. AS It was a restless night, waking up numerous times to urinate (normal) but my brain wouldn't shut up! There were many things on my mind, from the hedge trimming, leaves, homework, friend coming to stay. I wonder why some people seem to sail through getting their tasks done, while others struggle, what is the motivation factor that's missing? I've heard that those who have had nannies as children are less inclined to be good employees, less inclined to get work done. Yet two of my siblings are so active you would be put to shame. And all of us were cosseted by nannies. I didn't come to any conclusions but the Mind has had a thorough bashing to get a grip! 1 5 xx.xx AS Awoke with a positive mindset to get to grips with overeating, especially during this proving! As my track record so far has been not good. 1 7 03.36.00 NS While shopping I had a spacey feeling while at the checkout.

My husband laughingly said enter it in your diary! 1 11 03.21.36 OS Woke feeling that my day was going to go better. My face was still up but I wasn't going to dwell on it. It was the last of the 6 week physio sessions on my hip. I've set a few changes to my fitness schedules, which I hope will keep me moving in the right direction. 1 12 03.36.00 AS Got to grips with some outstanding tasks, I feel as though I'm more positive about getting through the backlog. With more energy and commitment to complete them than I've had for a while. Sleep overnight - awake 23.54, 1.34, 2.00, these were min. 6 minutes awake there were others that were less than a minute that I haven't noted. 1 13 10.48.00 AS Pushing myself more than usual today, creatively, so my confidence is growing. 1 17 08.24.00 AS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 57 Thinking back over time of proving, I've also cuddled the dogs more, when they're on my lap, stroking their fur, and enjoying their sheen. They are being over keen to jump on my lap, to the point I now don't want them up. I'm being less tolerant of them. Making them come up on my terms. 1 20 00.00.00 AS I was verbally under attack at a girls golf get together after a lesson having coffee in the club house, in front of three others, it made me feel sick in my stomach and was close to tears. Sadly I was just talking about homeopathy and she laid into me saying how it wasn't robust and that the NHS should not fund it. And the vaccination issues.... I don't feel that I have enough backbone or verbal jousting skills to stand up for myself or homeopathy under these circumstances. It took all my courage not to get up and walk out, but I felt very uncomfortable. I hope that as the next two years progress I will have more courage to back my convictions as it is a shame that bullies get away with this sort of unfeeling attack. I am not good at defending my opinions in front of a group of people, always the underdog. Still feeling a little Lac Caninum! from the last months homework!!!! 1 22 03.36.00 OS Very emotional, watching old romantic movies, feeling choked, tearful. More than I usually am. Even sad war stories on the news, old veterans bring tears to my eyes, feel their pain in my stomach. 1 23 13.12.00 AS Meltdown, unable to stem tears while speaking to my tutor. Took me quite a few minutes to compose myself. The experience took me back to school days, where I felt the issue started with me. It has followed me through my life. Never being able to shrug this barrier in my head so far. She kindly gave me time to get it together and I hope to try some different ways to overcome the issue. I have been more tearful of late. Certainly since taking the remedy. For the meeting. temperature control has been wonky, very tired, stabbing pain, a few dreams, one where someone was giving me a remedy but it didn't come in the pilule form it was in a glass scalloped jar full of orange-red sand topped with seaweed and shells. I seem to have a good day or two and then plummet. Still emotional to the tearful even watching something silly on the TV! 1 30 08.24.00 OS Overactive, unable to sleep, neck and right shoulder really stiff. 1 30 10.33.36 NS Heard a voice saying 6.30, sounded like my friend, but it must have been in my head, jumped straight out of bed and went to make a cuppa. The clock in the kitchen said it was 6.28. Seems as though my internal alarm clock now talks to me!! My friend who is staying with me said at 7 .30 that when I told her this thought she had heard me say this before a deja vous moment.... 1 30 06.00.00 NS I helped a friend with their dog, who was killing chickens. After presenting our Ram to the young dog to help prevent him from worrying sheep, we proceeded to test him with first the geese then the chickens. The exercise has made me wonder how many hats can I wear? Over the years there are many things I've The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 58 had to learn many different skills. None of which has made me a fortune. The old saying came to mind, Jack of all trades and master of none. So feelings of inadequacy have been rearing their heads again. The saying Jack of all trades ..., was said of me by an ex employer in a derogatory form, I feel these sorts of comments deeply, taking them to heart. Rather than brushing them off. 1 38 08.24.00 OS I had an urge to go out and buy a load of different yard brooms. Having found two that were rotten. I didn't just go and get a couple, came home with 4! Also ordering two ton bags of gravel for the drive while I was at it.

I spent ages looking at some new outfits, but couldn't find anything better than I have already at home. I just ended up with a new scarf, with a scene of sunlight through branches depicted on it. 1 41 11.31.12 OS Very emotional, having to go to a memorial service of someone I worked for. His son gave his epitaph and the whole congregation were in tears. A very moving event. I found it was very healing in clearing old pent up emotions. I was late because I'd been out to the sheep before I left, something made me watch them longer than needed so I was next to last entering the church. But my old boss would have enjoyed the fact that the sheep came first! 1 42 00.00.00 OS Feeling homesick for Ireland, I was looking at properties on the west coast of Ireland this evening. I found one that was under offer that would have been perfect. I don't think it would take much for me to up sticks and move back. Certainly as a future choice I'm likely to make the move. 1 44 04.48.00 OS My husband has had neck pain moving from left to right, then down to right chest. Following a flu vaccine earlier the previous week, so probably a mild reaction from that. I have felt very anxious for him as he didn't look well. Worrying that he might get worse. He was not himself. I find it hard to help him homeopathically as he is on a lot of medication, so feel he needs to tread that path himself if he chooses. 1 45 10.48.00 OS Awoke with a mission to get certain housework tasks completed before breakfast. 1 49 08.24.00 OS Fixing my mind on tasks is difficult, finding all sorts of jobs to do instead of my homework. 1 52 06.00.00 OS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 59 Feeling tearful, my mind is so negative, thinking I can't get my homework finished, no good, thinking of giving up. This has been building for a while, along with finding it hard to sleep. I managed to find the strength to get the case finished, but it is not in my normal format, not cohesive, so I hope that the tutors will forgive any discrepancies. 1 55 13.12.00 NS The clearing, as the meditation progressed to feeling the light shine down on us, I envisaged a powerful beam of bright white light, as I looked down the top of a large pink sphere with fissure engulfed by gas coloured flames, ranging from electric blue to orange and yellow, mesmerising. 1 57 07 .12.00 NS I woke early, with stillness in my mind I closed my eyes, I saw a fist sized sphere of embers burning their last energy before going out, the sphere diminished to the size of a pea and expired with a puff. 1 58 10.48.00 NS Prover 2 I feel serene, light tingling, spacious. 2 0 01.40.48 NS Lots of laughter in the room.

I've often had such a feeling in the past but not for a year or so, I used to wake up daily with this feeling of dread but it went through homeopathy and counselling...I feel annoyed that this feeling has returned because it's so dominating and I thought I'd beaten it.

When my wings went back inside me I was really aware of the place in my back where they had The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 66 entered inside me and of the front of my body where the heart energy was beaming out. The two places are equal and opposite. 4 6 XX.XX NS During an exchange with my friend and parenting expert, when I was consciously moving into pain and sadness, after not much time I came out the other side of the feeling into a real peaceful and energetic state.

Its like a surrender to the support of the ground and allows a tiny amount of relaxation in the neck and shoulders. After some time, a great sadness comes and I start to cry. There is no reason for this, it is just a huge wave of sadness that I allow to wash through me. The crying feels good. 4 20 18.45.00 AS I went to attend my daughter's class assembly on Remembrance.

I looked at the clock and I thought it said 21.27 . I looked again a couple of minutes later and it was 22.15 - I was completely shocked.

Throughout the proving weekend an individual who normally is distant from the group physically moved herself to be closer to me in class. As we sat after class for a glass of wine I said that I was happy that we had got closer this weekend, and felt like we had bonded. She began to cry and said it had been lovely and that she often didn't feel part of the group. I then challenged softly what she thought the group was and how as individuals we have to also take ownership of our inclusion in a group. Another classmate also joined in the conversation and also felt more bonded that weekend and that she felt the group had always been in packs. We talked a lot more about the group and how we are as individuals and it was really lovely, and strong and intense. A third classmate joined the conversation and I found myself challenging, again softly, her outward language and approach. I told her bringing a more authentic self would be great to see as that person is awesome. It was taken well and also felt nice.

Today I was calm and listened. I hardly said a word, but said it was ok and I would still help her. The conversation felt like the end for her. Following the conversation I began to cry and then weep. Two main thoughts; I can't help her, and I wish she could hear me. She said she is not the 'looking after' type. She did give me a lot though. She has made me who I am. I have given as good as I got. I have the sense of separation, like it's ok to separate. I can be a person not her daughter. It's a calm sadness. But it is very sad. I can't fix it, I can't heal her pain. 5 1 12.15.00 NS Anger building worried that I might be honest and direct with someone and hurt their feelings.

Woke up in the night very angry at my child waking me up. Very shouty and raging anger. The anger stayed all the next day and I was describing to everyone that I was in a 'bad mood'. I had an overwhelming feeling that everyone (except my husband!) Was completely incompetent. At everything and anything?! I felt a lack of support from close friends and family and everyone else was just useless. I guess it was that I felt I was better than everyone, and more efficient.

Its very unusual for us in the 10yrs of marriage to have this irritation with each other. Feel like there's a complete disconnection. Like as if there has always been this disconnect and we've never been aligned. It is very odd as we have always prided ourselves on being 'a team'.

When I realised we were arguing about the butter dish I realised this was a big change and only during proving! 5 xx NS Group dynamics in college had changed and I could see someone upset someone and then people commented how they would then see that person instantly come and sit or kneel next to me to just 'chat'.

I was visiting the family home and troubleshooting problems in the house prior to selling. Getting taps fixed and showers that didn't work, sorting the garden. My husband came for a couple of days. There was an issue with the agents who were looking after the property (we didn't have one at the time in real life) they wanted payment for me being there, I was understandably irritated as there had been no discussion with the family that there would be a charge for me to stay and do the repairs! The Lawyers were in the dream to, who I seemed to be getting on with ok. There was a meeting arranged, this entailed a trip on a boat to a nearby island, which incurred a \u00a349 ticket, so unnecessary. None of my siblings were there. (None of this actually happened in real life so an imagined conflict.) 1 10 03.36.00 NS All I remember is seeing a body with a hole charred and bloody completely from stomach to lower abdomen, as if it had exploded. I woke with a start. 1 32 10.48.00 NS I woke after a dream that was to do with an appointment I missed on Tuesday it had gone out of my head with the people who had turned up, I panicked and scrambled to get there an hour late. The appointment I was dreaming about is for this Tuesday evening, a new class of Pilates I'm joining with a consultation the hour before. I'm sometime forgetful of keeping appointments, and have set up reminders on my phone and computer that jog me to remember such things....

As I'm not good at motivating myself to keep up the exercises at home. 1 24 5..55 NS There are two beautiful young women standing opposite each other, one is belong, the other is dark, they both have athletic bodies and are dressed is tight gym clothing, they want to get intimate with each other, but each time they do they are given electric shock therapy. 2 1 XX.XX NS I have a dream that on a coach with all my old friends from university. Chatting with him when I spoke to Simon is there. I'm very surprised because my understanding was that sign was killed during the Tsunami in Thailand many years ago. I was always something that shocked and upset me, as although we were the best friends we were very close and in many ways quite similar. I spoke to different people on the coach about Simon and they all said that I was wrong he had not been killed. Eventually I went and spoke with Simon it was really nice to see him again and he has aged well. We spent quite a lot of time chatting on the coach. I didn't mention to him I thought you died many years ago. 2 11 XX.XX NS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 99 I'm in an old classic car. It's a convertible American Mustang. It belongs to my friend Simon he is sat next to me in the passenger seat and I am driving. It's giving me tips because it's not the easiest car to drive. It still needs a lot of work. Really enjoying our time together, it is all a bit of a surprise to me because as far as I was aware Simon passed away many years ago. Return to go up the private drive back towards the hotel where were staying he's telling me to keep in Ludlow keep the refs hi set the car doesn't count. As we give up the steep Hill another classic car comes flying down hill towards us twisting and turning eventually rolling over and crashing. I swear violently to avoid it. Simon tells me to keep going I will lose all refs in the car will stop we won't have started again. As we drive past we it's into the trash car thankfully there is no driver inside. 2 11 XX.XX NS In my dream I was being groomed (child abuse). I had to bury my child sized bike. My family were not there to protect me. 4 36 XX.XX NS I was an architect. I created daring buildings in unlikely places including out at sea. Part of the feeling was the need to win approval. I think I had lost someone and I was being plied with liquor to numb the pain at the end of each day. 4 45 XX.XX NS I have only fragments - needing to learn something and being ready ahead of time in order to choose a teacher and everyone being really surprised. Swirling around in a crowd as part of a ritual, a kind of chaotic dance. 4 41 XX.XX NS I was staying on a kind of private military base. I was swinging on a swing when I saw a small plane that looked as though it was going to crash in a nose dive. Sparks were flying off it. It pulled out of the dive at the last second and I realised it was doing stunts. Then I saw a photographer who was walking the tight rope to get the perfect shot. Many people came to watch and I lost my peaceful space on the hilltop. It was a violent, chaotic and abrupt end to my innocent play. After, I met the photographer and he really liked me. The rest of the dream was him pursuing me and me politely trying to avoid his advances (unwanted attention) in all sorts of strange settings including space, and on raft. 4 35 XX.XX NS I was chosen to marry a wild character in order to try to bring him more under the control of my family and to calm him down. I was very quiet and shy and felt apprehensive, felt like a completely innocent and naive child bride. There were cowboy style Wild West shootouts going on. 4 39 XX.XX NS I was trying to understand and explain something to my daughter's friend and her mother in terms that they could grasp. I had chosen to do this through god as they are strong believers. It was like talking The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 100 another language to me. Also trying to find ways to put the child at ease because she is very shy (connection). 4 34 XX.XX NS connection and disconnection. I was part of a group that worked in some kind or organising, like a cool version of a town planner. Sometimes we were so connected and creative and in the flow and all would go right. Other times it was completely the opposite - no connection, everything going wrong, everything difficult. 4 6 XX.XX NS I was travelling but in another world in the equivalent of 3rd world countries. I think I was travelling with a group but I felt alone, excluded. I experienced a lot of generosity from the people as well as the darker side of theft and trickery. Feelings of connection//disconnection. 4 17 XX.XX NS I was at my cathartic meditation event, ready to jump into the process but it just didn't get started. People kept talking and interrupting and it just couldn't get going. I felt really frustrated. Later on, there were multiples of each person, alive at the same time as a child, a young adult and a middle aged person. Someone wanted to get rid of these abominations, but each of their selves had to die at exactly the same moment or they just popped back into existence. They were on the run together, looking after each other with such care and tenderness. 4 51 XX.XX NS I was working at a small spiritual festival with the jewellery stall. It was on top of a mountain. I had to drive up roads that were closed to get there (guarded by locals) and I felt quite anxious (disconnection). I got my hair cut twice. I was trying to get inside information about another event (at the hairdressers) but it didn't really work out. 4 22 XX.XX NS I was back in Thailand and reconnecting with my best friend there and her mother. We were not behaving how we used to. There was some kind of etiquette to follow, it was uncomfortable. We went for a massage and the place was empty. Still they sat chatting for 30 mins keeping us waiting. Finally I got up as if to leave and so they started. 4 3 XX.XX NS I can't remember my dream very well but I know there was a strong birthday theme (in real life it is my daughter's birthday today). There was a sense of disappointment, of things never being quite right or as people wanted them to be. A gap in the understanding and expectations. Disconnect. 4 13 XX.XX NS My dream was about the passing on of knowledge. The apprenticeship was a lonely, isolated role though (disconnection). They would be left alone in the woods for the masters to collect as everyone watched secretly to see what would happen from the bushes. There were a lot of rules, but it was really difficult to The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 101 come by all the information as \"the powers that be\" were not keen on being transparent. The main feeling for me was frustration. I wanted to do the right thing but I didn't have enough information. 4 10 XX.XX NS I was in the Quaker meeting as a kind of new member. An elderly man was organising a family constellation. He very much wanted me to step in even though it was at the last minute. There were also classes like at college and later I had to take the guinea pigs to the vet. After their eyes went bad like Cuddles' (our real life guinea pig) did and I knew they would die. There were times in this dream that I felt quite special. At others I felt like an outsider that didn't belong. 4 15 XX.XX NS Dreamt that I returned as a student to a school that I had been away from for years. I tried talking to people and making friends but they just wouldn't let me in. I remained a total outsider (disconnection). 4 11 XX.XX NS I was going to get married to the son of a wealthy family. They did not approve. All of the wedding stuff that they produced was full of photos and information about the family and the guests but there was nothing about me at all. It made me feel like an unwelcome outsider. I was passing the time leading up to the wedding diving in the sea to collect something. But when I dived all I found was stacks of empty rotting animal hutches. I met someone down there who was moving and speaking as if on dry land. He looked at me like I was really weird for not being able to be as he was. Total disconnect, very strange. 4 12 XX.XX NS The most clear and vivid part of my dream was the amazing plant growing in the hotel room at the end of the bed. The really long stems were uneven in texture and covered in extremely sharp thorns. Quite high up they became very leafy - the leaves were small and light green to pink. It grew quite twisty and seemed a very strange choice for the bottom of the bed (it covered the whole wall). My friend was letting me stay for a while because I needed a break (from my life). I would sit for ages in the hotel lobby watching all the comings and goings - it was huge and busy, it felt like an airport. I felt isolated and disconnected from everyone. 4 9 XX.XX NS What I woke up remembering from my dream was that one friend was being shamed by another for still carrying big feelings about a miscarriage she'd had years ago. It felt unfair that she should be shamed for that - she had carried that baby to term and gone through labour. That is not something you ever get over. But somehow, though I felt that strongly, I couldn't find my voice to fully stand up for her. Disconnection from my power. 4 18 XX.XX NS Epic quest with a bumbling central character who kept getting things so wrong . The final escape was made on the backs of dragons - the feeling was elation at having got away but fear that the dragon would not safely land on the beach ahead but instead take a nose dive into the water. 4 33 XX.XX NS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 102 At times in my dream I was on the run. I was trying to board a train with my daughter that would take us to safety, like Jews fleeing Germany just as Hitler came into power. The police were trying to find us and we were dashing through the train trying not to be seen. It was frightening, tense. Would we make it? In another part, we were living safely in a huge house, but someone had found out where we were. There was a sense of being trapped, cornered - time had run out for us although we weren't going to give up the fight for survival. 4 49 XX.XX NS I was at my woodland with the kids for a big meeting. There was some politicking and I tried to keep out of it. A documentary maker came onto the land to try to film dinosaurs. Before all that it felt like I was on the run from something (was I a spy?) and needed help to get away. 4 44 XX.XX NS I went to live in a commune. The guy in charge of the water filtration showed me how it worked and it felt magical. I was in awe looking around at how well they ran it. It felt like coming home 4 48 XX.XX NS It's interesting how it's becoming harder to recall my dreams as we near the end of the proving I can remember having my feet massaged by a professional dancer. I remember that my mum was really impressed by her because she has decided to change her career and within 6 months of changing she was at the top of her game in a completely new field. 4 55 XX.XX NS I was with old friends in India only it felt more like France. We were so happy to see each other, there were many long hugs. We spoke about the young ones, who were kids before and now were grown up. There were families of leopards on the periphery and we were trying to locate them for conservation purposes to make sure they were ok. The overall feeling was a nostalgic happy sadness and responsibility and concern for the young ones and the animals. 4 53 XX.XX NS Gillian McKeith was forcing me to watch insects killing each other. I particularly remember a huge hornet. It stung inside the mouth of another (unrecognisable) creature which killed it. When they were all dead, she insisted that we eat them. I experienced a kind of horror at watching this in such a voyeuristic way and disgust at having to eat them. She was the one wielding the power though and somehow I could not say no. 4 29 XX.XX NS I was at the school of homeopathy. Most of the village surrounding it was inhabited by different members of my (fictional) family. Everyone wanted a piece of me. I was always needed by one household or another to look after their kids or whatever. One day while we were in class they went off on a massive protest which was very noisy and disturbing. After, I was sat on the doorstep with a few kids waiting for the dad to come home with the keys. Another bit of the dream was bumping into a really old friend who I haven't The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 103 seen in 18 years. He didn't know me. I couldn't understand why and it made me deeply sad - this sadness and confusion stayed with me throughout the day and I was still thinking about it at bedtime. 4 42 XX.XX NS I was like the Q (like in James Bond) for a bunch of spy kids ( but at one point I was also a spy kid myself). I really felt a responsibility for these kids regarding the danger I was sending them into. For them it was like a game, for me it was deadly serious. 4 14 XX.XX NS Private trips around the natural history museum, although it wasn't as developed as it is in real life. We were able to sleep in the room with some of the exhibits, we watched the live bats. 4 25 XX.XX NS I was responsible for a big group of children- like a holiday camp leader. I was telling another adult about all the things my ex had given me when he sold his house. I had a huge collection of vinyl which I got out later for someone to play at a disco. 4 27 XX.XX NS In my dream I was responsible for everyone and we kept needing to move and I had to find new places for us to live. The last image before I woke up was of my daughters face crumpling in pain because her tummy hurt. 4 32 XX.XX NS We were homeopaths, about to be qualified, doing a supervised case taking course where we had to stay on site. It felt like another country and there was a holiday vibe. I started smoking roll ups again, but it didn't matter, it was just for the trip. Some of the senior homeopaths didn't want to let go and allow us to take the cases. It was all a bit chaotic. The feeling was one of being held back, not being allowed to take responsibility. 4 40 XX.XX NS I was a volunteer at my kids school. They had me making cheese sandwiches for all the kids with special dietary requirements. Each one needed a different cheese and I couldn't find the right one for my own daughter. She was doing a class assembly and showing a sunflower that she had grown at home. My throat got so dry that it felt like it was sticking together and I couldn't breathe. I couldn't find my glass to drink some water and I felt panicked. I woke up with the same sensation and drank water and coughed and coughed. 4 52 XX.XX NS We were living in France at a friends house. The lifestyle was a lot more enjoyable and everything was smoother and easier. Someone asked me why we didn't just stay permanently, and I said that they wouldn't sell us the house. I felt sad. There was an interactive tv show, as you watched it, you could participate. I ended up being part of the cast. But I was also not a part of it (disconnection). It was my The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 104 responsibility to integrate the hedonistic star of the show who was really into himself but rubbish at connecting with others. It was exciting. 4 26 XX.XX NS I was working hard to try to bring down a group of corrupt politicians. I had to persuade people who were afraid to speak to me and give me their stories and their evidence. My mum was worried for my safety and wanted me to let it go, but I was determined. There were scenes of kids being chased by baddies who were trying to kill them. I was buried alive in the desert and every time I dug myself out I would sink in again like it was quicksand. It was a horrifying fight for my life. 4 50 XX.XX NS I was a teacher taking kids on a school trip (responsibility). I delighted in coming up with really exciting and unusual experiences for them. In another part I was running away from my husband with the children. I don't know why but the feeling was that I had to get away to be safe. In another part I was trying to please my parents - cooking nice things for them, but somehow I was always messing up and disappointing them. 4 19 XX.XX NS Dream of two sisters growing up, changes in responsibilities, moving from fear to confidence. Each one discovering in their own way - \"I can\", finding their power. 4 21 XX.XX NS I was living in a community, I think we were displaced refugees. My daughter was chosen to play a live lounge session on radio 1 but I couldn't be there to support her because I had to go on some kind of mission to find a family for a child (responsibility). The first half of my daughters live lounge show went really well but then it went wrong. When I got back she was in a state. A friend arrived and said she would be going to the local college with me and I felt so happy to have someone familiar along with me. 4 43 XX.XX NS I was part of a small team employed to find people's remedies. We had one serious case and I was sure that the remedy was wrong. He was only being palliated by his remedy, there was no cure. The feelings of my team mates were hurt (or their egos) so they said I should just do it myself (feeling of responsibility). I had to go inside his head while he was dreaming and discovered that he was not at all who everyone thought he was. I was trying to do a wee but the drains were blocked and everyone's wee was swirling around on the floor and coming up my legs. I was unable to urinate. 4 31 XX.XX NS There were snake experts and snake lovers who had volunteered to handle them so that people could watch and learn. One almost seemed to fly through the air and bit the man right in his neck. He could not get it off him so others rushed in to help. It was highly venomous and he died right in front of us. Later I was at a place like Hawkwood with amazing food. Some of the connection /disconnection issues were arising. There were also lots of pranks being played. 4 8 XX.XX NS The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 105 Although I couldn't remember my dream clearly, what was very clear was that I was angry, enraged by some kind of injustice. 4 16 XX.XX NS I was in a kind of dormitory - I was not there by choice. There was a matron figure who patrolled the dorm. In the morning I went for a shower only to find that a panel was missing in the wall and the person in the cubicle next to me could see me completely. It was a man and it felt horrible to exposed like that - no boundaries and no privacy. 4 38 XX.XX NS I was running a race with my daughter in India, it was a marathon. She was ahead of me and sometimes I lost sight of her. My husband tried to hold me back so that my other daughter could catch up but I was afraid of losing Nyah (the younger one) who had gone ahead and I wrenched myself free. 4 2 XX.XX NS I was needing to be rescued from out at sea where I was stranded with 2 friends in a small inflatable. I was fearless. 4 24 XX.XX NS In my dream, the land had been chopped up into little parcels, and in order to claim them you had to be standing on the land when the registrar came around. Each bit was tiny. We were desperately trying to stake our claim but at the same time it seemed so futile as the pieces were so small. 4 30 XX.XX NS The feature of my dream was gemstones and their magical powers which I was using to stay hidden, to avoid and also to defeat baddies. Amethyst was the main star, but there were others. 4 57 XX.XX NS The main part was that I was living back in Pune and I had just split up with my husband (my choice) Then I had to watch him slow dancing with another woman. It made me feel really awful, sick, gutted, sad. I decided to go for a day trip to a cat zoo but it was a really long drive and by the time I got there it was closing. It was a long and strange drive through some never ending woodland. Disappointment and sadness were the main feelings. 4 4 XX.XX NS Dream of organising an epic Halloween experience. A complex stylish dance performance on bungee cords. Being with my family and enjoying the togetherness of watching and participating in the experience. 4 20 XX.XX NS Dream - it was very complicated and I don't remember much, but just before I woke up I had chosen to pee all over the floor. I felt out of control because I couldn't stop, and at the same time I was desperately trying The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 106 to stop it from spreading too far by mopping up whilst peeing. I was visible to others who looked on with incredulity. 4 28 XX.XX NS I was making remedies from medicating potencies up in my dream. That's all I can remember! 4 54 XX.XX NS We were in my daughters bedroom and my husband had hit my daughter and I was stood behind him trying to stop him (but not physically) but scared myself (although in real life I am in an abusive relationship he has never hit me just pushed me around and other stuff but he did once hit my daughter four years ago when I had gone away for the weekend so this wasn't the same in any way apart from people) next bit in dream I had an itchy lower vagina. 6 xx.xx NS I had two dreams, the bigger one I lost the other; there were big fat tigers walking around and the man in front just ignored them. Then I realized we were at a circus and they had been mistreated so I was training them with kindness and bits of meat. First they were sat on stools and I went and fed each one of the three a small piece of meat, then realized that's not a good idea, when they are used to eating something as big as my head. Next time I just threw big (leg of lamb size) bits of meat the man walked off unimpressed 6 07 .05 NS I was laid in bed and my husband had scared me so I was the other side of the bed on the floor crouching down, he came owner the bed grabbed my arm and some hair and I was a rag doll he pulled me onto the bed then he was sat on the bed and had two fingers at the top and two at the bottom and a wooden coffee stirrer in my mouth I couldn't understand what he was doing but I wasn't gagging then woke. 6 04.15 NS This guy was talking to me then I slid off the sofa, he then had a white Dr. jacket on but wanted to look at the laser in my eye. did it all forcefully then dream followed on in a dark room and a few people but a young lady big teeth smile is talking above the others, then they are passing food out but instead of passing along she just puts it in her bag in the commotion.

Slid the door again and it was chaos with a row of people but over on left side was an old male friend who had lost (as in died) a little boy and wanted to talk to him but every time I tried I got this version of him I didn't like. Then back in the lift and was talking to someone but her name was (was something else) someone and I was holding a small knitted purse with a zip at the top and a knitted purple flower The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 107 stuck to the front but each petal was meant to be a different colour but it wasn't .

We were talking about the state of the wires and saying this is why old Mrs.? phone didn't work. On the way back down there was one sleeper laid on top of another which meant it was only one shoe width wide, there were stones and sea glass so I stopped to kick them into the water, then The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 108 we had climbed through and there was a set of beds and a couple acting out BDSM, he was shock and unsure we said we wouldn't tell if we could join in.

We found the children and they were fine but years later, we found the student in the next village, where she'd set up a battered fish business. Her son was angry with her for cheating customers and her business was falling apart/disintegrating. We also had a fish business and ours was flourishing even though she had cheated us at the beginning. Her deceitfulness and betrayal had been found out. 11 32 6.3 NS I dreamt there was a dead horse balanced on a wall with ledges for its hooves to attach it there but when I lifted it down it became alive and began running round in a circle on a rein, circling round and round, a beautiful white horse with a flowing mane like one you would see on a carousel. I felt happy and was enjoying the beauty and energy of the horse. I was in charge of the horse but when it fell down I became a male soldier and had to go to the sick bay. The sick bay was a small hut, like a child's play house, so it was very small and cramped and I had to crouch down and double up to fit in it. In the room above me in the play house people were having sex and I felt doubly uncomfortable. Somebody put their head in the door of the house and asked me what I was doing there. I didn't want them to see me or know I'm there and felt embarrassed. I see my son messing about in a toy car with another child in front of him who started crying but then they were messing about together. Initially I felt angry with my son for driving the car into a smaller child and knocking him over. I pulled him out of the toy car and then realised that the other child was also being silly and joining in and wasn't upset or hurt at all. Everything was fine. 11 31 6.3 NS I was holding a baby over my shoulder and the baby was settling really well with me. The baby belonged to my husband's sister who'd wanted to take the baby onto the roof of a high building where there was grass growing (on the roof). I thought it was too dangerous for the baby who was wearing a baby gro. A small, impish looking boy pulled violently on the baby's leg, pulling the babygro off it's leg so that the clothing stretched. I was really angry and went to kick the boy but just stopped myself in time. I complained to the teacher as we were in the middle of a singing maths lesson. I didn't understand the maths lesson and had no idea what they were trying to teach. I had no understanding of what was going on at all. The baby was now mine as my husband's sister had died so the baby was going to be mine. I ran away with the baby and we were chased by one man and boys on motorised bikes/trikes inside an ornate formal garden. When the man caught up and spoke with me here was no threat. I kept the baby. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 110 11 13 6.3 NS I was in an interactive museum looking at turtles and other sea creatures damaged by plastic pollution. There were demos in which the sea creatures had their heads stuck in plastic that looked like a dog's white veterinary collar. My son and I were upset by this cruelty to animals. Before we left the plastic was taken off them. We didn't like they way the plastic was deliberately put into the tank of water to entrap the creatures. I wrote a note saying I love you but the spelling was wrong. 11 23 6.3 NS During the provers meeting I remembered a dream I had last week about mothering, which had strongly affected me. The dream was as follows. t that my three guinea pigs escaped from their hutch, running away under the hedge and fence into next door's garden. I managed to get them to come back to their hutch but they're not happy, they're cold. I'm worried I'm going to lose them and I know that they don't want to live here anymore as they don't like it, because they don't like me. I'm in Sweden or Scandinavia, touring around a big house with paintings and crafts in large castle rooms. The atmosphere is welcoming and calm. I had to do an assault course with my family which we did silently. I didn't think I could do it but I went across a plastic/long beanbag across a high drop to the floor where there were crash mats. People outside the castle were saving overturned boats and exploring the arts and crafts. I thought I'd got on well with one of the women at the castle but she rang me up to tell me that she doesn't like me because I'm full of rage and anger. As she said this I realised who she was, the goddess Gaia, Mother Earth, and felt devastated. I felt hurt by Gaia as I thought we'd got on well and that she might be a friend. Everyone at the castle was calm, gentle, kind, low voiced but they didn't like me. I didn't fit in. Felt sad, rejected, ugly. 11 1 x NS I dreamt that a fellow student was anally raped in a tent at a market. There were lots of tents there. Next day she was sobbing. There was a lot of cum everywhere and all over her. I felt fear, shame, horror, revulsion. Afraid it might happen to me.

It hit our big barn and demolished the roof and half the walls. Luckily not a passenger train, I don't know what happened to the driver. The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 111 1 49 xx.xx NS Sometime before waking I had a dream of being recommended a remedy, it was unusual in that it didn't come in pilule form but it was in a glass jar with a scalloped top to it. In the jar contained sand, with different seaweeds on the top under the scalloped glass. I was told to take one grain of sand and all my symptoms would disappear! When I woke I thought about this sand, remembering an article in the Homeopathic Journal on Red Sea Sand, which is for people who have been moved from their homeland, or in a struggle in their relationship. I have been thinking about my uprooting from Ireland as a teenager and how my life would be different if the family had stayed in Ireland. 1 13 xx.xx NS I was in china amongst the market cafe's, there was a competition which I seemed to be part of. The choices of food were numbered by dice shaped symbols with writing I couldn't understand. The food choices were also unexplained to me. I had to sit down with the only other competitor and eat something. No chat, I couldn't work out what it was all for, the reason for the competition, all seemed pointless. 1 4 13.12.00 NS I had a horrible dream. At first I was a diamond thief, and I stole three expensive diamonds, I was in a city maybe Hong Kong. I decided to cover my tracks I would go to the cinema, I arrived at 11.55pm and there was a showing of the film I wanted to see at 12.01 so I went and bought two tubs of chocolate caramel icecream and lots of chocolate and popcorn and went into the film. The staff were really nice to me, and when the police stormed into the theatre I was really ashamed and embarrassed that the staff who served the popcorn etc saw that i was a thief. Next I was walking arm in arm with a friend, not sure who, down a clearing between lots of trees, under a big monument statue with a chimney on top. Something told me a part of the chimney was going to fall and as I looked up, there was a huge rock of plummeting towards me, it fell just a step infront of me and a part broke off and hit my head. Next I was watching the dream instead of being the person in it, but the person I was watching was me, although it didn't look like me. There was the girl who had suffered the head injury, she was blonde and late teens. She was lying on her bed in a grand house and she was naked, it was daytime. I remember being quite shocked she was naked, because her father walked in. she looked at him with a nervous smile and he asked her if her head was better and she said yes but that makes me worried about you...Then the father said something reassuring like there's nothing to worry about. The next scene was the girl in a cellar, I knew it was the same house, and she was tied up in a bondage style way and her father was having sex with her. I was watching it in the dream like a film and I felt so overwhelmed with disgust I tried to turn it off somehow but instead it just sped up, showing more and more scenes of the abuse and then another man was there too...all I could think was how much I wanted to kill the men and I thought of her poor head having just recovered from this injury. All of a sudden I was in a different house, with my kids, preparing to go out and trying to finalise details of where I was going with my childminder. I didn't feel the kids were safe with just her though so I got another childminder to come round and be with her too. Then I left but immediately rang my boyfriend and asked him to go home and help the childminders with the girls. I was paying so much for the extra help but I felt convinced the girls wouldn't be safe otherwise. Then I was on a beach, with my friend who's a hairdresser and we were at the checkout of a beauty shop which was on the sand and she was making me pay for all this hair dye which wasn't for me. I felt angry about it but didn't dare say anything. All the time I The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 112 was thinking about the girl in their basement and how I had to free her somehow. Then I woke up!! Now I feel dazed, disgusted and a bit traumatised. The sexual element of her relationship with her father does kind of make sense to me slightly in the way that I've never met my dad, and when I was younger I remember feeling uncomfortable when my friends Dad's would be around, I felt like they were predatory, especially one incident when I lived with my best friend in a flat when I was 20, and her dad came over and she was in her underwear and she sat on his lap and gave him a cuddle, and I was really disturbed by it I felt like it was a secret signal that there was something going on between them, I couldn't judge what was normal or not because I had no frame of reference. I've also always struggled to believe any relationship I might have with a man isn't related to some sort of condition of sex, because I haven't had many or any platonic relationships with men, like the one between a father and daughter, there's always a price to pay so to speak. 3 3 00.00.00 ns I dreamt very vividly again, two dreams linked together, I was an assassin in both of them and had to kill a lot of people. I was being controlled by a group of men and if I didn't carry out the murders, they would hurt my family who they were holding in a warehouse, there were lots of girls and women being held there and trafficked for prostitution. I had such a strong sense in the dream that if I didn't do as I was told, my mum and daughters would be really harmed so I just did whatever they said. The dream was full of gruesome scenes of violence. In the dream I felt overwhelmingly frustrated but also so so angry and I knew I had a plan which would free my family, I wanted to kill the men in charge. 3 2 00.00.00 NS I dream that I'm in a house which I've only visited in dreams before, but it's the same house. It's really big, a mansion, in north London where I grew up. The house is configured around a central space with stairs spiralling up and around to 5 or 6 floors, the ceiling height of the central room goes right to the top of the house and there are incredible hanging plants which reach all the way down to the floor for 6 ceiling heights above. the house belongs to a school friend of mine in the dream, I think it was my friend Olivia who I knew at primary school in London, her dad was one of the lawyers to the Queen and her house always really impressed me when I was little, as did her Dad. In the dream I'm pretending to be 'X' to the people who work at her house and for some reason they're believing me. I feel really happy to be accepted but also really nervous about her brothers coming home and realising I wasn't her. Suddenly her two older brothers come home from a Bat Mitzvah and they're comparing party bags and I'm hiding behind the sofa in this room which the 6xheight ceiling. One of them spots me and shouts and I have to run! I get the feeling it's something I do a lot to that family and I used to be really accepted by them but I wanted to be a proper part of their family so much that I went too far with pretending to be 'X' so I fell from being a family friend to a pest who they didn't want to know. I felt longing, jealousy, rejection and banishment to a life of loneliness with no joy or luxury like they had in their lives. 3 8 00.00.00 ns have a dream I'm a snake being chased by other snakes and they're coming from every direction and I'm terrified, I don't think I'll be able to get away 3 20 00.00.00 ns The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 113 we are talking about snakes in class and I remember that I had a dream last night about three snakes hanging from a fence, all intertwined as one I couldn't tell where they ended and begun, it looked like they were just one three-headed snake. It was mesmerising and the snakes felt really symbolic and important 3 2 12.32.00 ns I dream that I am in a play as the main part but haven't seen the script and it's opening night. The show is due to start in a few hours and instead of getting ready, I go to spa hotel with my boyfriend and just sit in the jacuzzi. Then I realise I'm 3 hours late, at first I can't find out what the time is and all the phones and clocks have different times but then I find mine, it's on silent and I've got 100 missed calls. It's the same feeling I had in the dream about my Dad when I was at his wedding but left, like this massive panic and frustration that someone has lead me away from what I need to be doing like I'm stuck and trapped and can't get where I want or need to be. 3 6 00.00.00 ns I have a dream that I'm in the park and find a man hole. I lift it up and see a dimly lit ladder. I climb down and find the tunnel opens out into an enormous ballroom which hasn't been used for years. I can see even though its dark. I walk across the enormous room to the back of the room and through two doors there's a large bathroom and then a kitchen. Every room has old brown leaves fringing the edges and there's dusty mud all over the floor, but beneath are beautiful tiles. I run back through the rooms to the ladder and climb back up the man hole. My boyfriend is standing there on the grass wondering where i went, and he's thrilled and decided to run around the park looking for another man hole. He finds one about 50metres away and opens it, he disappears and ten mins later pops back shouting to come and look. I go down the ladder after him and there's a night club! all unused and dusty. We spend a few hours opening more man holes and find an enormous mansion beneath the park with an indoor swimming pool. All the rooms are connected but we have to dig through walls of soil. we do this with out hands and i can feel the soil beneath my finger nails. We decide to throw a big party. My boyfriend gets a group of friends together to clean the place up and I go to a party shop and really want to hire a smoke machine but its \u00a3200 and I cant afford it. Then I wake up. I feel disappointed to wake up and miss the party. 3 5 00.00.00 ns I dreamt that I was at a vintage sale with my friend and I'd stolen something and she didn't realise but I knew that the people running it knew so I was trying to hide from them without telling Abbie, so I was having to distract and divert her all around this big hotel where the sale was being held. I felt very anxious, embarrassed but also a bit excited that I was managing to dodge the authority. 3 15 X NS I dream that I'm at a will reading of my boyfriend's father and am really ashamed to learn he hasn't left anything to me, but he has left lots to everyone else and detailed the reasons why, praising them in each explanation and siting them as the only worthwhile people to have known. i feel left out, unimportant, bewildered, really sad and ashamed like I'm different and I don't matter and was foolish to imagine I did. 3 33 00.00.00 ns The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 114 I dream that I'm playing netball, I used to be the county captain at school and used to really enjoy playing, but this time I can't get hold of the ball, every time it bounces it becomes bigger and goes so high that it's impossible to catch. It gets so big it blocks out the light and makes everything dark. I feel really humiliated I can't play properly like I used to. 3 2 00.00.00 ns I have another dream where I'm at a big party in the countryside and I came as a guest but get mistaken by the staff there as a waitress, the party is being thrown by one of my best friends, who I don't know, called 'X', who I'm quite jealous of because my friend sees her more than me. In the dream, 'X' knows I was meant to be a guest but pretends to everyone she doesn't recognise me, so I have to work at the party cleaning up and doing as I'm told by her. I feel embarrassed again and wish I could be an equal to the guests but I feel inferior. 3 2 00.00.00 ns I had a really intense dream in which my boyfriend left me for a girl we went to school with because she is skinnier than me \"and he sees no sign of my weight decreasing\". I met all our friends in the dream after he'd dumped me and they all seemed to think that was a reasonable reason, and I felt as if I was going to explode with how horrible and unfair it was! No one seemed to notice how I felt and just tutted at me for being bigger than the other skinny girl. My boyfriend felt totally shut off to me and like he didn't care about me whatsoever, but it was my fault for not trying to lose the baby weight. I woke feeling very overwhelmed as if it was real, I was incredibly sad and angry! 3 1 00.00.00 NS For the first time in my life I have a dream with my Dad in. I've never met him so don't actually know what he's like but in the dream it feels like it's really him. I go to Texas (where he lives in real life) because I know it's his wedding. In real life, he married his second wife 15 years ago but in the dream I've managed to find out about the upcoming wedding and decide to go to finally confront him and meet him. My best friend and I turn up at this really swanky polo club, it's very sunny, the event is being held in a field and at the entrance which is made from flower arches there's a big board with the guests names on , and I know we won't be on there. There are some people greeting guests, but they feel more like security guards. We approach them and they ask our names, and I can see my Dad swanning about speaking to guests and hosting everyone. I feel very nervous when I see him but excited. The guards tell us that our names aren't on the list, but I call out \"Dad\" and he whips his head round and sees us standing there. His expression goes from shock to disgust to a really fake smile and he sachets over, and greets us like he was expecting us but grips my arm very hard as he ushers us through the flower arch into the wedding. I feel thrilled but scared. Next the ceremony has finished and we're sitting at the tables eating but our names are on the place cards, written perfectly in calligraphy, like we were really invited. Everyone is being very friendly but no one has asked how much they've never heard of me before, they just act as if they've known about me all along, and I wonder if they really have. Suddenly my best friend suggests we go for a walk and we are back in an area where I grew up, trying to get an uber to take us back to the wedding in Texas, and I realise we've been an hour and the wedding is progressing without us and I worry we might miss it. We arrive back at the wedding and it's over. My Dad has dropped the act. I've now got my girls with me and he starts shouting at the baby, when she knocks something over, and she cries and cries. I'm furious with him and shout asking The Homeopathic Proving of 5-hydroxytryptamine 115 what's wrong with him, doesn't he know kids do that by accident some times? And he tells me he knows nothing about children and only sees his for 10 mins in the morning before work and that's it...I feel like I suddenly understand why he's denied my existence my whole life, because he is incapable of being a father, and I have a flash of feeling content and then wake up. I feel so blown away by this dream when I wake up. I feel like I really met him, which I've longed for my entire life. It felt like I get it now. I feel very dazed by the dream and haven't really stopped thinking about it since...it feels like it was a message to release him, and stop trying and hoping for contact...like I should just be at peace with how things are. 3 4 00.00.00 ns Dreamt of an eye, a blue eye with white surround, black eyelashes. Just one eye, like an ornament rather than a real eye. I've seen the eye before on a piece of jewellery last month and remember being fascinated and drawn in by it.

I asked at the local B&B, (the lady was a Mom of a girl I'm helping with anxiety problems in real life) but she hadn't seen him. The house had lots of corridors with doors everywhere. As I walked outside I could see over the town and all the houses were rammed together. Back in the woods I lifted the top off a pole and whatever had been underneath was gone and this meant that he'd gone back to Australia. I started talking to a friend of mine about a concert and she said that any ticket I wanted her husband could get as he was always in the right place and always seemed to come about them somehow. 7 4 01.40.48 NS I was staying at a friend of mine who's a doctor, Jac Naylor (Holby City character) I am also a doctor.

I walk along corridors and find myself in a large shop, the assistant directs me to the ladies but I find that she's given me wrong directions.

We were on a field by a river, the river was high, lots of water. I was suddenly watching James fall into the river, I could see him under the surface being swept away. My stomach clenched and I felt sick not knowing what to do, the pace of the river was fast and it was like rapids. I started screaming for help but no one heard. James seemed to be circling round in the water just under the surface but the water then seemed to be a form of land which then enabled him to stand up. He walked back onto the field towards his team mates. His old football coach was gathering up rubbish from around the field and everyone was walking away linking arms 7 10 03.07 .12 NS At college, a member of the group's boyfriend sat in the hall with us. He was an elderly man with wild hair like a mad professor. He kept on lifting up my notes and went to say something then put them down. He walked around the room and was taking things off notice boards and putting them in the bin if he didn't like them. His girlfriend didn't notice but everyone else did and it was obvious they were all really annoyed. I made a comment to a colleague that the only thing he couldn't criticise was the bottom of my shoe as he couldn't see it.

We were all getting ready and had our own 'cabins' that looked like railway carriages. I'm suddenly in there with a man and we're about to have sex but people keep coming in. I look at him but I couldn't make out his face in detail, it kept changing, the features were different as if changing from one person to the next. I was ready for the match and we all walked through the crowds to get to the field ready to play with shouts and cheers from the crowds lining the way holding banners 7 9 XX NS Again the details were gone. My Aunty was there and she was secretly leaving. She had a list, that she was measuring, that noted lots of possessions in the form of figures. There were loads of packages of money she'd left and I was handing them out to relatives and friends that didn't know she'd gone.
