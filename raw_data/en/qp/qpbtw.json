I'm not an antivaxer. My MIL has brought up that you need to space out the vaccines because it's too much for their little bodies and she's heard people at her work talk about how it changes the babies. A few of my husband's cousins had autistic children and so they have become very paranoid about this. MIL had brought it up before and I always tried to be polite and not start any problems over it but now my baby is 5 mo and had two rounds of vaccines and I'm tired and feeling much less diplomatic. So when she brought it up again I kind of w (politely) went off on her about it. I told her there's no proof that research had concluded that there is no link between vaccines and Autism and that it all started bc of a model/actress (Jenny McCarthy) and that she had no basis to make that statement and everyone lost their minds about it after that. After ingot off the phone I realized that it's been so long since I've really read any literature on this topic that I don't even know if what I said was correct. Does anyone know what the current literature is on this? I know she will bring it up again and I would like to be more confidently prepared so that we hopefully will never speak of it again. Edit to add: Thank you so much for everyone's responses! I knew that I would find the info I was looking for here. I so appreciate everyone's information so I can feel more informed on this topic and all of the perspectives around vaccines and misinformation around them. I would love to respond to everyone individually but my time is very limited since I have a 5 mo. Even writing this now is a challenge bc she's trying to swat my phone. I blame all typos on her! I "}
