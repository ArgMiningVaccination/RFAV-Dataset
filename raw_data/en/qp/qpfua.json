CHANNING: Thank you. I am Alan Channing. 4 C-H-A-N-N-I-N-G. I am the president and chief 5 executive officer of Sinai Health System. Thank 6 you for the opportunity to speak to you this 7 evening in support of our application for the 8 development of inpatient psychiatric services at 9 Holy Cross Hospital, the newest member of the 10 Sinai Health System. This proposal is in complet e 11 accord with our mission to improve the health of 12 the individuals in the communities we serve. 13 Sinai Health System includes Mount Sinai 14 Hospital, Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital, 15 Holy Cross Hospital, Sinai Medical Group, Sinai 16 Community Institute, and Sinai Urban Health 17 Institute. 18 Our system is one of the largest 19 providers of health care for low-income patients 20 in Illinois. Our service area, which includes 21 close to one and-a-half million people, includes 22 some of the most economically-disadvantaged 23 communities in Chicago. Our payer mix reflects 24 the communities that we serve with only five HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 8 1 percent of the patients seen through our inpatient 2 and outpatient program having private insurance 3 coverage. As a system, we provided over $46 4 million in charity care this past year. 5 Sinai is a critical part of the health 6 care delivery system on the West and South Sides. 7 The emergency rooms of Mount Sinai Hospital and 8 Holy Cross see about 100,000 patients every year. 9 We treat over 24,000 inpatients a year and provide 10 over 250,000 outpatient visits. While other 11 hospitals in Chicago have closed their trauma 12 centers, we remain as one of only four Level I 13 trauma centers remaining in the city, seeing over 14 2,000 trauma patients a year with traumatic 15 injuries, many of whom are uninsured. 16 Our system includes Level III neonatal 17 intensive care, specialized pediatric services, 18 strokes, spinal cord, traumatic brain injury, and 19 pediatric rehabilitation, and as you will hear 20 from others, comprehensive outpatient and 21 inpatient psychiatric services. 22 Our system substantially underwrites the 23 special care physicians of Sinai Medical Group wh o 24 currently provide over 145,000 patient visits a HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 9 1 year, often as a primary referral source to the 2 FQHCs on Chicago's West and South Sides, including 3 the FQHCs that we host on both the Mount Sinai and 4 Holy Cross campuses. 5 Specialty care has traditionally been 6 extremely difficult to access in the neighborhoods 7 we serve because of low or non-existent payment. 8 There are very few specialty care practices 9 serving inner city communities. We are proud of 10 our commitment to provide specialty services to 11 our communities. Our foundation is our unwaverin g 12 belief that patients from 13 economically-disadvantaged communities are 14 entitled to receive the same high quality care 15 that is available in more prosperous areas. 16 Despite the challenges of our payer mix, 17 our quality scores receive high national rankings . 18 Our disease management programs have received 19 widespread recognition and were recently featured 20 on the cover of Modern Health Care. 21 What sets Sinai apart from any other 22 health care system has been our holistic approach 23 to health care. We do not believe that health 24 care is simply medical care, and we have develope d HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 10 1 one of the broadest arrays of community based 2 programs in the country. Through Sinai Community 3 Institute and Sinai Urban Health Institute -- 4 MS. CLARKE: Two minutes. Please conclude. 5 MR. CHANNING: Through Sinai Community 6 Institute we provide an array of services that 7 include patient education, parenting services, 8 family case management. 9 When we began our discussions with the 10 Sisters of Saint Casimir about partnership with 11 Holy Cross Hospital, it was clear that we came 12 together to serve the needs of this community. 13 In closing, I've spoken about our 14 commitment to the residents in the neighborhoods 15 we serve, the comprehensive nature of programming 16 that we provide, our role as a safety net 17 provider, and the difficulties associated with 18 caring for the communities with minimal private 19 insurance coverage. 20 MS.

I am assistant 2 administrator at South Shore Hospital over the 3 Geriatric Psych Unit. 4 I've written statements which I would 5 like to give, but I will be very briefly on the 6 oral. 7 We are opposed to the 50-bed additional 8 units of Mount Sinai and Holy Cross. We perceive 9 that it would have a financial impact on the other 10 hospitals in the system by diluting more of the 11 usage of the mental health beds in the region. 12 We also believe that adding outpatient - - 13 intensive outpatient for the psych patient would 14 be more advantageous than inpatient beds. 15 Thank you. 16 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Thank you for your 17 remarks. 18 Number 2. 19 MR.

Our mission is 6 critical because, with very limited exceptions, we 7 serve only the neediest members of society. 8 Nearly all of our members are independent 9 community hospitals operating in urban areas with 10 significant socio-economic challenges. Our 11 hospitals are themselves needy because they have 12 limited opportunity, if any, to cross-subsidize 13 with commercial business, yet we face daunting 14 financial pressures from rising costs, significan t 15 charity care, an aging infrastructure, downward 16 pressure on revenues and the need to keep pace 17 with technology. 18 The Holy Cross and Mount Sinai proposal 19 does not consider the negative impact of this 20 proposal on the existing providers of these 21 services. 22 I am here today not as a representative 23 of Saint Bernard but as a representative of the 24 Association.

We trust 5 that this information will be carefully considered 6 and that it will help the CON Board members better 7 understand why this project should be rejected. 8 Thank you. 9 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Thank you. 10 Could I just remind everybody to speak a s 11 loudly as they can, we don't have any microphones 12 in this room, unfortunately.

My name is Sister Laura 19 Parker. I am the Director of the Spiritual Care 20 Department at Holy Cross Hospital. I will be 21 reading a statement on behalf of Sister Regina 22 Dubickas, the General Superior of the Sisters of 23 Saint Casimir, who had a previously-scheduled 24 commitment. HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 14 1 Good evening. I am Sister Regina 2 Dubickas, the General Superior of the Sisters of 3 Saint Casimir. The Sisters have served this 4 community and many areas of the Southwest Side for 5 over 100 years. In 1928, our religious 6 congregation became the sponsors of Holy Cross 7 Hospital. In light of the changing face of health 8 care and the desire to ensure a viable future for 9 Holy Cross Hospital as it serves the needs of this 10 community, we chose to become part of the Sinai 11 Health System in January of last year. This 12 decision was made with very careful planning and 13 much prayerful discernment. This transfer has 14 allowed a mission of healing to continue in 15 communities with very profound needs. Of great 16 satisfaction to the sisters has been Sinai Health 17 System's strong commitment to serve struggling 18 communities, to continue with Holy Cross remainin g 19 a Catholic hospital, and with the Sisters of Sain t 20 Casimir as the religious sponsors. 21 The communities that Holy Cross Hospital 22 serves have suffered greatly from harsh economic 23 conditions and diminishing assets. Issues of 24 violence, predatory lending, hunger and scarcitie s HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 15 1 of health resources have been very challenging for 2 our people. Over the years, the Sisters of Saint 3 Casimir have joined ranks with area churches and 4 community institutions to save and reinvigorate 5 the surrounding neighborhoods -- 6 MS. CLARKE: Two minutes. 7 SR. PARKER: -- and strengthen the health and 8 safety of the people who live there. 9 In choosing the partnership with Sinai 10 Health System, the Sisters were impressed with th e 11 long-term shared commitment of the individual 12 institutions in serving the economically 13 disadvantaged. We found that the Sinai Health 14 System's mission was very close to that which we 15 Sisters held at Holy Cross Hospital. 16 MS. CLARKE: Please conclude. 17 SR. PARKER: On behalf of the Sisters of Sain t 18 Casimir, I strongly urge the CON Board to approve 19 this proposed psychiatric unit at Holy Cross 20 Hospital. Thank you. 21 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Thank you. 22 Number 4. 23 DR. STREITMATTER: Good evening. I am 24 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: SERVICES Page 16 1 S-T-R-E-I-T-M-A-T-T-E-R. I am an Internal 2 Medicine specialist and cardiologist at Holy 3 Cross. I've been a member of Holy Cross Hospital 4 medical staff since 1980. 5 The majority of my patients live in the 6 communities surrounding the hospital. There are 7 many challenges in treating the population that 8 has few financial resources and inadequate 9 insurance coverage. Many of my patients have 10 difficulty arranging for transportation, even whe n 11 it may be for services in the local area. Public 12 transportation is very limited with only one 13 nearby and limited service bus line and the 14 closest CTA train station is miles away. Not onl y 15 does the lack of accessible inpatient resources 16 create unnecessary and non-therapeutic burdens on 17 ill patients and their families, these shortages 18 and placement hurdles tie up valuable clinical 19 time for physicians and the other members of the 20 health care staff. 21 The real picture for placement of 22 patients requiring inpatient psychiatric services 23 is one of many time-consuming phone calls, 24 multiple rejections, and escalating frustrations HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 17 1 for patients, families, physicians and staff. The 2 subsequent waits can create a cascade of road 3 blocks for delivering emergency care to other 4 patients waiting to be treated. Some of these 5 untreated patients may have critical health issues 6 that require immediate care. 7 Sinai Health System has an established 8 record of providing psychiatric care that is high 9 quality and responsive to the uninsured and 10 underinsured. 11 As a community physician, I strongly urg e 12 the CON Board to approve this project. 13 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Number 6.

I am the 18 Chairperson of Department of Psychiatry and 19 Behavioral Health at Mount Sinai Hospital. 20 During my 34 years at Mount Sinai 21 Hospital, the communities we serve have 22 experienced growth in the number of patients 23 needing inpatient psych hospitalization and a 24 decrease in the number of beds available to the HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 18 1 patients we serve. 2 Mount Sinai's inpatient psych unit is 3 extremely busy. We operate at functional capacity 4 at all times. The 220 to 240 per month psych 5 presentations to emergency department from the 6 community and from our outpatient adult programs 7 drive our inpatient volume. In a normal day, our 8 unit is admitting and discharging 36 percent of 9 our bed capacity. On very busy days, we have 10 admitted and discharged 75 percent of our bed 11 capacity. Our emergency department often has 12 boarders who have to wait two to three days for a 13 psychiatric bed to become available. There's a 14 tremendous need for psych beds on the West Side o f 15 Chicago. 16 Thank you. 17 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Thank you. 18 Number 7. 19 MR. WILSON: Good evening. My name is David 20 Wilson, and I am Sinai Health System's Assistant 21 Vice-President for Behavioral Health Services. I 22 am here tonight not only to voice my support for 23 the development of an inpatient psychiatric 24 program at Holy Cross Hospital, but to confirm HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 19 1 that the proposed program is absolutely consistent 2 with our system's commitment to addressing the 3 mental health needs of those neighborhoods served 4 by Holy Cross and Mount Sinai hospitals. 5 Last spring we completed a mental health 6 needs assessments of the communities served by 7 Holy Cross, and found a general lack of 8 accessibility within the community to both 9 inpatient as well as outpatient mental health 10 programming and services. Since that time we hav e 11 implemented a program to provide timely 12 psychiatric consultations on Holy Cross's medical 13 units, we have initiated adult psychiatric 14 assessment and medication management services at 15 the hospital, and have increased the community's 16 awareness of the broad scope of outpatient 17 services available through Sinai Health System. 18 Sinai Health System's outpatient mental 19 health programs are among the busiest in the 20 Chicago area and continue to grow. During the 21 past year we provided 79,651 outpatient mental 22 health treatments, and we are serving 23 approximately 240 new outpatients a month through 24 the programs located at our Mount Sinai campus. HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 20 1 In addition to our campus-based 2 outpatient programming, we are actively providing 3 outpatient mental health services, ranging from 4 psychological evaluations and rehabilitation, and 5 to medication and case management services, to 6 family and group therapy in the neighborhoods, 7 teaming up with organizations such as Interfaith 8 House and Chicago Public Schools. 9 We provide pre-admission screenings at 10 sites such as Cook County Jail and Stroger 11 Hospital. 12 We have developed a satellite site in 13 Oak Park where we provide assessments, care 14 management and therapies. 15 We provide supportive residential 16 services to adult community members suffering fro m 17 chronic mental illness at Pioneer House. This 18 service helps to keep area residents in their hom e 19 community and out of emergency departments and 20 inpatient psychiatric units. 21 We operate a bilingual program called 22 Under the Rainbow, which targets our community's 23 youth population. 24 We provide mental health caregivers that HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 21 1 are fluent in American sign language and versed in 2 deaf culture. 3 These outpatient and residential programs 4 complement Mount Sinai Hospital's 26-bed inpatient 5 unit, which routinely operates at functional 6 capacity. Most patients admitted to that unit 7 originate in the hospital's ED, and during the 8 year ending this past June 30th, 416 patients 9 needed to be transferred to another hospital -- 10 MS. CLARKE: Please wrap up. 11 MR. WILSON: -- from our ED because we did no t 12 have available beds for them. 13 During that same period, we weren't able 14 to accept a single transfer from Holy Cross 15 Hospital. Holy Cross has one of the few EDs that 16 sees more patients than Mount Sinai. During the 17 same period when Mount Sinai had transferred 416 18 patients -- 19 MS. CLARKE: Please conclude. 20 MR.

CLARKE: Number 8. 7 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Number 8. 8 MR. BARTOW: Good evening. My name is Jeff 9 Bartow. I am the Executive Director of the 10 Southwest Organizing Project. SWOP is a 11 broad-based, multi-issue community organization 12 serving 30 local Southwest Side institutions, 13 which represent approximately 35,000. SWOP's 14 leadership works across racial, religious, and 15 economic differences to build the collective 16 capacity of families to act for the common good i n 17 the neighborhoods we serve. 18 For many years, SWOP has partnered 19 closely with Holy Cross Hospital to address the 20 needs of our community. Holy Cross and Sinai 21 Health System have demonstrated a very strong 22 commitment to care for the uninsured and 23 underinsured. We believe that there's a shortage 24 of acute mental illness hospital beds near to the HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 23 1 people that live in our Southwest Side 2 neighborhoods. While there may be beds at distant 3 hospitals, relatively few are available to 4 Medicaid or uninsured patients. 5 I must also tell you that public 6 transportation is very limited in our area and 7 this is an extremely important factor for many 8 people. I personally had to travel over 10 miles 9 to visit community members in need of psychiatric 10 services. 11 Holy Cross is vitally important to this 12 community. One of the most important benefits 13 that SWOP sees in the recent Sinai Health System 14 partnership is the addition of a spectrum of 15 behavioral health services. 16 For these reasons, the Southwest 17 Organizing Project strongly urges the Illinois 18 Health Facilities and Planning Board to approve 19 this needed acute mental illness unit at Holy 20 Cross Hospital. 21 Thank you. 22 THE COURT REPORTER: Could you spell your las t 23 name, please? Page 24 1 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Number 9, please. 2 MR. SPENCER: Good afternoon. I am Scott 3 Spencer. S-C-O-T-T S-P-E-N-C-E-R. I am the CFO 4 of South Shore Hospital located at 5 8012 South Crandon Avenue, about 25 minutes east 6 of Holy Cross Hospital. 7 I am here to oppose the Holy Cross CON to 8 establish a 50-bed AMI Unit. 9 South Shore Hospital is a 136-bed safety 10 net acute care community provider that has served 11 the Southeast Side of Chicago for over 100 years. 12 The hospital is one of the largest employers on 13 the Southeast Side, with more than 500 employees, 14 75 percent of which live in the City of Chicago. 15 Our medical staff consists of over 200 physicians 16 and allied health professionals. 17 South Shore has a 15-bed geriatric psych 18 unit that was opened in December 2012. In 2013, 19 the unit experienced 50 percent occupancy. 20 The Holy Cross application is 21 contradictory in that the attempt appears to be 22 made to justify the need for a 50-bed AMI Unit in 23 order to keep psych patients in their community, 24 close to their homes.

Accordingly, th e 14 Medicaid inpatient utilization rate at Loretto 15 Hospital is one of the highest in the state, 16 currently at 78 percent. 17 On behalf of Loretto Hospital, I am here 18 today to voice my opposition to the proposed Holy 19 Cross 50-bed inpatient psychiatric unit, because 20 the establishment of such a unit will have a 21 negative impact on the financial stability of 22 Loretto Hospital and it will jeopardize its 23 ability to compete in providing acute care, 24 including behavioral health treatment services, t o HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 27 1 the residents of Chicago's largest community, that 2 is the Austin community. 3 Loretto Hospital has the ability to 4 accommodate a daily behavioral health census of 5 70.

I am the Director of 13 Behavioral Health for Saint Bernard Hospital. 14 Our planning area is already over bedded 15 for AMI by 76 inpatient mental health beds. The 16 proposed addition of 50 inpatient beds at Holy 17 Cross Hospital runs counter to the state's 18 initiatives to reduce readmissions for mental 19 health diagnosis. If we are to achieve the 20 state's goals and better -- provide better care t o 21 patients, community-based outpatient mental healt h 22 services are desperately needed in the region, no t 23 more inpatient beds. 24 Community-based outpatient mental health HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 34 1 services are more likely to ensure patients' 2 long-term mental health needs are met. The 3 addition of 50 inpatient beds at Holy Cross 4 Hospital will have little impact on resolving 5 these critical issues and will jeopardize the 6 financial viability of current programs. 7 If we are to interrupt the vicious cycle 8 of readmissions to facilitate recovery and improve 9 patients' ability to function in society and be 10 employable, providers need to invest their 11 resources in delivering outpatient support. With 12 Habilitative Systems, Incorporated, Human Resourc e 13 Development Institute, and the Family Guidance 14 Centers, we have co-located and are currently 15 assessing patient needs, bringing the providers t o 16 the patient. Keeping patients actively engaged i n 17 their treatment, providing motivational 18 counseling, ensuring patients have money for 19 medication and transportation to outpatient 20 counseling, as well as transitional housing are 21 needed to eliminate barriers that impede holistic 22 recovery. 23 Additionally, there's a dire need to 24 address psychosocial issues, such as drug and HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 35 1 alcohol abuse, homelessness, joblessness, and 2 physical and sexual abuse that create triggers for 3 relapse.

The history you get at home, because of 18 family, is better than what the patient gives you 19 in hospital, and that you have ability to educate 20 the patient, educate family about patient's 21 problems when you treat them in the community. 22 When we discharge patients from the 23 hospital, they go to family where they get all th e 24 facilities and care providers that they need when HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 37 1 they are discharged from hospital. So why do you 2 want to take a patient out from the community to a 3 hospital? It doesn't make sense. 4 We base treatments mainly in the 5 community because of the advantages. It allows 6 for home treatment, education, low cost. All the 7 health care providers out there in the 8 communities. So why do you want want to move a 9 patient to the hospital? It doesn't make any 10 sense. Those days are over. 11 In England, we have community care and 12 that's what I want to help in society at 13 Saint Bernard Hospital. 14 MS. CLARKE: Two minutes. 15 DR. KOKO: Treatment of patients, true 16 commitment-based service allow for the most 17 effective treatment of patient. Holy Cross 18 Hospital will not change delivery system, will no t 19 improve outcomes, and will only drain funds that 20 we need for psychiatric patients. 21 Thank you. 22 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Thank you. 23 Number 15. 24 MR.

I am here today to talk about Mount 2 Sinai Health System. 3 I was born in the Lawndale area, all my 4 life, 32 years. In 2004 when Mount Sinai Hospital 5 wanted to take over several blocks of my 6 neighborhood, they started making promises to 7 those of us who live there.

I've worked in the medical health 2 care field for over 30 years. I am here today 3 because I think it would be a shame for Mount 4 Sinai to spend over $8 million on something that 5 isn't needed. There are a lot of mental health 6 care needs in Chicago. So it doesn't make any 7 sense for us to spend money on something that we 8 already have that's working. 9 Saint Bernard is just down the street 10 from Holy Cross Hospital, approximately 11 minute s 11 away. We have plenty of acute mental health 12 skills. Survey shows that there are plenty of 13 beds in the whole area, period. When Holy Cross 14 has a patient that needs an AMI bed, they can sen d 15 them over to us or to another hospital in the 16 area. The system works and it's been working thi s 17 way for a long time. It's not broken. So why ar e 18 we trying to fix it? 19 What Holy Cross doesn't have is enough 20 services for people who need outpatient mental 21 health care. That would be a better way to spend 22 the money. 23 I also understand Mount Sinai has some 24 infrastructure needs. Mount Sinai could use more HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 41 1 staff, more patient care, could use some of these 2 million dollars that way. 3 All of us who work in health care know 4 that it's important to use our resources wisely. 5 Sinai Health System has over $8 million to spend, 6 I don't think they should spend it on beds that 7 aren't really needed.

I was 4 surprised to find out that Sinai has so much money 5 to spend on Holy Cross. 6 I can tell you about what's needed here 7 at Mount Sinai. We need to invest more in front 8 line patient care and make sure we have adequate 9 staffing. We have excellent staff here, but we 10 are stretched really thin. We are short staff 11 most of the time. We have to have sitters, which 12 pull the CNAs off of the floors, to sit with 13 people who have mental issues. We also need more 14 resources to help us do our jobs better. We need 15 more personal care equipment. 16 Plus, we need to fix our facility. I've 17 seen leaking pipes with water running down in 18 different areas of the hospital. Only a few of 19 the problems that need to be fixed immediately. 20 Eight and-a-half million dollars goes a long way 21 towards fixing our facility. 22 We also help provide the outpatient care 23 needed here in our community.

COYNE: I am Sister Margaret Coyne. Last 18 name is C-O-Y-N-E. 19 Thank you for the opportunity to be hear d 20 today. My name is Sister Margaret Coyne. I am 21 currently the Director of the Behavioral Health 22 Program at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center. I 23 am speaking today in opposition to CON Number 24 13-076 for Holy Cross Hospital to establish a HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 49 1 50-bed AMI service. I am opposing this due to the 2 excessive number of psychiatric beds in the area. 3 Mercy Hospital has a well-developed 4 Behavioral Health Program that services patients 5 throughout Chicago's South, Southwest, and West 6 Sides. We offer a broad program of specialized 7 inpatient and outpatient services. Our outpatient 8 services alone -- or inpatient services alone 9 offer psychiatry, group psychotherapy, social 10 work, occupational therapy, wellness group, 11 recreation group and exercise group therapies. W e 12 have a 39-bed inpatient AMI service consisting of 13 both general population and substance abuse 14 patients units. 15 A vast majority of our patients are 16 admitted from the emergency department or are 17 referred from other hospitals' emergency 18 departments. Many of our patients are medically 19 underserved, homeless, and less than 50 percent 20 have any family involvement in their treatment. 21 At the same time we provide outstanding 22 care, having become the referral center for the 23 University of Chicago Medicine, we have also 24 become the referral center for Stroger Hospital, HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 50 1 Loyola, Gottlieb, and others. 2 After an inpatient stay, our patients are 3 usually discharged into a follow-up program, 4 usually one of our day hospital or intensive 5 outpatient programs. Our busiest services are our 6 least acute level of care or our mental health 7 clinic which operates five days a week. 8 Our outpatient program is growing and 9 remains strong, reflective of the general shift in 10 care to the outpatient setting. However, even 11 with the strong referral network, our inpatient 12 units have significant excess capacity. For the 13 last four years -- 14 MS. CLARKE: Two minutes. 15 SR. COYNE: -- we have had, on average, in 16 excess of 16 patient -- inpatients bed available, 17 operating the unit at less than 60 percent 18 occupancy. 19 For the above reasons, I am opposed to 20 this application to establish a new 50-bed AMI 21 inpatient psychiatric service in this area. 22 Thank you. 23 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Thank you. 24 Number 23.

I've been 3 practicing psychiatry for 12 years. I'm currently 4 the Acting Chair of Psychiatry at Mercy Hospital, 5 as well as an assistant professor at the 6 University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. 7 Today I am speaking in opposition to the 8 Holy Cross proposal for a 50-bed AMI service. I 9 am opposing this due to the excessive number of 10 psychiatric beds in the vicinity and to what I 11 believe is a misplaced allocation of resources. 12 The behavioral health service is robust 13 at Mercy Hospital, serving the area throughout 14 Chicago's South, Southwest and West Sides. We 15 have a 39-bed patient unit, serving both the 16 general population and substance abuse patients. 17 A patient will generally remain on our inpatient 18 care for five and-a-half to six days before being 19 discharged to a follow-up program, usually one of 20 our intensive outpatient or day hospitalization 21 programs. Our busiest services are our outpatien t 22 mental health clinic which operates five days per 23 week. 24 Mercy Hospital has been the referral HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 52 1 center for inpatient psychiatry for the University 2 of Chicago since it closed its inpatient service 3 in 2007. We get referrals from Stroger Hospital, 4 which lacks an AMI service, and regularly get 5 referrals from Loyola Medical Center, Gottlieb 6 Hospital, and others. 7 In spite of the robust program and 8 referral network, our inpatient program maintains 9 significant untapped capacity, not unlike other 10 programs within the nearby planning areas. Since 11 2009, inpatient utilization has remained 12 relatively flat, giving us an excess capacity of 13 approximately, on average, 16 beds. Moreover, it 14 is the shift in practice from inpatient to 15 outpatient services of various modalities and 16 venues that is one of the core reasons for low 17 inpatient use rates. Our growth rate in 18 outpatient treatment has been approximately 4.5 19 percent annually. This illustrates the need to 20 put more resources into outpatient treatment 21 facilities as a way to improve mental health care . 22 MS. CLARKE: Two minutes. 23 DR. ANDERSON: This is where our true need 24 exists, a need that will continue to grow.

For 13 several years I was the coordinator of the Health y 14 Chicago Lawn Coalition.

It has been hit very hard by many 2 difficult and sometimes traumatic realities, such 3 as violence, lack of accessible transportation, 4 lack of good jobs, high incidences of many chronic 5 health issues. 6 This area feels at times left by the 7 wayside and many of our residents need for 8 assistance of mental health services that are 9 convenient and willing to treat uninsured and 10 underinsured populations. 11 As a resident and as a person who has 12 been acutely involved in helping people have 13 access to improved health care, I strongly urge 14 the approval of an inpatient behavioral health 15 program at Holy Cross Hospital. 16 Thank you. 17 HEARING OFFICER URSO: Number 27, please. 18 MR.

I've served in this 9 capacity for the last 13 years. Today I am 10 testifying in opposition to CON Number 13-076, th e 11 establishment of a 50-bed AMI service at Holy 12 Cross Hospital. 13 During its 162-year history, Mercy 14 Hospital and Medical Center has been committed to 15 serving the poor and medically-disadvantaged 16 within our community. In the area of behavioral 17 health services, we maintain two inpatient 18 psychiatric units, general and substance abuse. 19 In addition, we provide intensive outpatient 20 programs, including partial hospitalization as 21 well as outpatient mental health clinics. Our 22 programs are resource intensive, including 23 psychiatry, group psychotherapy, social work, 24 occupational therapy, wellness group, recreation HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 57 1 group, and exercise group therapies. 2 We are the referral center for University 3 of Chicago since it closed its inpatient service 4 in 2007. Additionally, we are the referral site 5 for Stroger Hospital, Loyola, Gottlieb, and 6 others. Still, we do not find a growing demand 7 for inpatient AMI service and have an average 8 daily census of 16 on the 39-bed unit. 9 In considering just the safety net 10 hospitals in the immediate area, there are 158 11 available AMI beds. If one considers a broader 12 area, 45-minute drive as defined by the Board, 13 there are over 290 beds available, below the 85 14 percent occupancy rate threshold. 15 As a safety net hospital, fulfillment of 16 our mission has often been a financial challenge. 17 If the Board were to approve a new inpatient 18 psychiatric unit in our area, I do believe that w e 19 will have a profound negative impact on our 20 admissions and inpatient revenue that helps 21 support that program, as well as our outpatient 22 services. 23 We are conservatively estimating that 24 the -- HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 58 1 MS.

I am joined by my 4 colleague Robyn E. Grange, Director for the Office 5 of Congressman Rush. 6 Congressman Rush wishes to express his 7 strong support to Mount Sinai to establish an 8 inpatient psychiatric unit at Holy Cross Hospital 9 on Chicago's Southwest Side. This development 10 will provide service in an area in which 11 significant shortages exists. 12 Congressman Rush commends Mount Sinai 13 Health System, and President and CEO Alan 14 Channing, along with Holy Cross Hospital Senior 15 Vice-President Lori Pacura, for having the vision 16 to move this great effort forward to the Southwes t 17 Side of Chicago. 18 As we all should know, there's an 19 undeniable need for mental health services and 20 facilities in our community, and no rational 21 argument can be made to the contrary. 22 According to the National Alliance on 23 Mental Illness, from 2009 to 2012, the State of 24 Illinois experienced a decline of mental health HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 64 1 funding to the tune of $187 million which 2 represented over 30 percent of the mental health 3 budget. This decrease put Illinois first amongst 4 states in the nations for total number of dollars 5 cut for mental health programs at the end of 2011. 6 In August of 2012, after 37 years of 7 operation, the South Side Community Mental Health 8 Council led by Dr. Carl Bell to provide vital 9 services to over 1,000 patients in our community 10 was forced to shut its doors. This was one of si x 11 mental health facilities sites that closed here o n 12 the South Side of Chicago between 2009 and 2012. 13 With gun violence, drug abuse, and other 14 mental health challenges that are crying out loud 15 for the type of assistance that Mount Sinai and 16 Holy Cross seek to provide, we must stand with 17 them and work with them. 18 For many years Sinai Health System 19 addressed the mental health needs of the 20 communities it serves. A great significance has 21 been the commitment to provide high-quality care 22 for Medicaid -- 23 MS. CLARKE: Two minutes. 24 MR.

I am just going to 8 hit the highlights of this, as I can talk 20 9 minutes, but I've only got two. 10 There are multiple technical defects in 11 the application, not the least of which is that 12 there's no financial analysis of the alternatives 13 to this project. There's no discussion on the 14 impact of the five other hospitals in the plannin g 15 area, which was referred to from some of these 16 hospitals tonight. I find it amazing that Mount 17 Sinai and Holy Cross didn't address that issue in 18 this application. 19 Attachment 22 (b) (1), which is Page 125 , 20 I urge the Board to look at that. It says there' s 21 a surplus of acute mental illness beds in the 22 planning area. A surplus. The Certificate of 23 Need application should be denied on that basis 24 alone. And we've heard tonight stories from thes e HEARING 3/4/2014 www.midwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.3376 Fax: 314.644.1334 MIDWEST LITIGATION SERVICES Page 67 1 other hospitals about the surplus and how the 2 surplus beds are not being utilized, they are not 3 getting the referrals to the surplus beds. That's 4 grounds to deny the petition. 5 One of the gentlemen who talked here 6 tonight said that, I am quoting him, he said 7 there's no rational argument that can be made that 8 we don't need -- 9 MS.

From 2009 to 5 2012, community mental health in Illinois 6 experienced $113 million in cuts from the state. 7 In addition, the state also closed Tinley Park 8 Mental Health Hospital, a state-operated 9 inpatient psychiatric hospital. The cuts and 10 closings open up additional gaps in a continuum o f 11 care, treatment, and services in need of an array 12 of psychiatric services. 13 Last year the Department of Mental Healt h 14 reported care is available to only 16 percent of 15 those in need.
