Palo Santo Loosely translated, \"holy wood\" or \"sacred wood.\" Palo santo has been used for hundreds of years by indigenous tribe's shamans for spiritual applications as one of the most spiritual essential oils. The aroma of Palo Santo is uniquely sweet and woody. It was used by the Incas to purify and cleanse the spirit from negative energies. Its name originates from: anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Benefits Palo santo essential oil benefits include relieving symptoms of common colds, coughs, stress, headaches, anxiety, inflammation, emotional trauma, and more. It has qualities that help the regrowth of knee cartilage, reduce arthritis pain and inflammation, rheumatism, gout, respiratory problems, and reduce airborne contaminant when diffused. It has cancer-fighting properties, is a stimulant for the immune system and supports a healthy nervous system. Palo santo helps [support the immune system by turning off inflammatory responses](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/natural-remedies-for-inflammation-pain/) created by a poor diet, pollution, stress and illness. Palo santo essential oil is widely used in folk medicine for stomach aches, as a sudorific, and as liniment for rheumatism. In one published Cuban medical study, components in the oil inhibited the growth of a specific type of breast cancer, MCF-7. Both palo santo and frankincense are spiritual essential oils used for emotional and spiritual support because they work as natural anxiety remedies. After inhalation, palo santo travels directly through the olfactory system to the brain, where it helps to turn on the [body's relaxation response to reduce panic, anxiety, and insomnia](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/best-essential-oils-for-anxiety-and-stress/). Palo santo can be used as a substitute for frankincense and myrrh in many blends. In typing this section I misspelled \"palo santo\" a couple of times as \"palo santa.\" Upon reflection, I think \"palo santa\" might not be a bad name for it because of all the gifts this spiritual essential oil brings. Background In Ecuador it is against the law to remove or cut down palo santo trees because they are protected. Additionally, even taking a dead tree has strong permit requirements by the government. Very few companies have permits to even touch the trees, let alone even to produce its spiritual essential oil. The wood of the palo santo tree is of no earthly use unless the tree has died of natural causes. If a palo santo tree is cut into while it is still alive, it will need to undergo at least three years of a natural alchemical process of breaking down and decaying before it releases its precious and spiritual essential oil. Native cultures believe that [there are magical qualities](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/magical-herbs-and-plants/) to the tree and the spirits within materialize themselves as the oil. This is why the properties are believed to be healing and powerful. Palo santo oil is distilled from the heartwood of the palo santo tree. The heartwood must be at least two years old and be from the red wood to produce the higher quality oil. The longer the tree has been dead, the more powerful and spiritual the essential oil. This also holds true for frankincense. There is a wonderful story shared by internationally certified aroma therapist Cristina Proano-Carrion on her blog about this [sacred and spiritual essential oil](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/22-essential-oils-for-chakras/). According to legend, long before the world was born, a young lad named Crosokait was one of the very few humans alive. He fell in love with a young maiden but the love was unrequited. He fell ill with the sadness of rejection and although he called for her many times on his deathbed, she did not come. He uttered these dying words: \"I'll always be with her, I will decorate her head with perfumed flowers. I will frighten insects away from her. I will give fragrance to the water that her lips drink. I will go to heaven in the aromatic smoke during the ceremony. I will be wherever she is and will give her whatever she asks for...\" A tree grew up on the very spot where he was buried. When it was burned the wood released a deep, sweet aroma. The local Tobas tribe named it the palo santo tree as a symbol of love, kindness, and longing for an impossible love. Palo santo is used in South America in much the same way as white ceremonial sage is used in North America: [to combat negative energy and to cleanse a space](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/spiritual-protection-clearing-psychic-negativity/). Amazonian shamans use it in sacred plant spirit ceremonies; the rising smoke of the lit sticks is believed to enter the energy field of ritual participants to clear misfortune, negative thoughts, and chase away evil spirits. The Criollo people used the smoke of palo santo along with the burning leaves of Ruta chalepensis for patients with ear infections. Ruta chalepensis is commonly known as \"fringed rue,\" a perennial herb native to Eurasia and North Africa, which has been traditionally used as an herbal remedy for inflammation and fever. Palo santo's properties as a spiritual essential oil and substance are also known to have been valued medicinally, by inhaling its smoke along with burning yerba mate leaves and even feathers of the rhea bird (a flightless bird similar to an ostrich) for its healing effects. Some protected palo santo comes from sustainably cultivated wood grown on a fifty-acre farm in Ecuador that contains both naturally occurring and replanted palo santo. To date they have replanted more than five thousand palo santo trees on the land to ensure an adequate supply of this for the future. For those who utilize essential oils for meditation practice, prayer or other spiritual applications, palo santo is a spiritual essential oil with exceptional merits.

Spikenard (Jatamansi) Spikenard, (Nardostachys jatamansi), also known as Jatamansi is widely used in herbal medicines. Several herbal, medicinal preparations based on this plant are available in India and subcontinental countries. There are several products on the market disguised as spikenard, namely things labeled \"Bhutkeshi\" or \"False Jatamansi.\" The real plant is native to Nepal. Spikenard is also one of the incenses used in ancient Egypt. Its name anti-rheumatic, aromatic, carminative, depurative, diaphoretic/sudorific, skin tonic. Benefits In addition to being one of the best spiritual essential oils, the plant has a rich history of medicinal use and has been valued for centuries in Ayurvedic (Indian) and Unani (ancient Greco-Arab) systems of medicine. The rhizomes of the plant are [used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/ayurvedic-diet-guidelines-for-health/) as a bitter tonic, stimulant, anti-spasmodic, and to treat hysteria, convulsions, and epilepsy. The root has been medically used to treat insomnia as well as blood, circulatory, and mental disorders. Some preparations of the plant have been used as a heptotonic, cardiotonic, analgesic, and diuretic in the Unani system of medicine. The plant is of economic importance and has been used to produce perfumes and dyes. Spikenard, and it's spiritual essential oil, have been utilized since ancient times as a medicine for curing heart diseases, intellectual disabilities, urine-related problems, insomnia etc. Famed Ayurvedic healer charaka and \"father of surgery\" Sushruta incorporated spikenard in many medicinal essential oils, prescribed for edema, hemorrhoids, arthritis, gout, fractures, and obstinate skin diseases, mostly for external application. Spikenard essential oil is an excellent remedy for many skin ailments that are caused by bacterial infections. It has been used on wounds to protect them from bacterial infections. It is also a deodorant, a laxative and a sedative. Spikenard essential oil suppresses inflammation in the digestive and nervous systems, irritability nervousness, depression, stress, and emotions such as anxiety, anger, and panic. It also sedates cardiac problems. These sedating and relaxing are beneficial reliefs to insomnia. Background The Bible contains several references to this spiritual essential oil in both the Old and New Testaments. Catholics claim it represents Saint Joseph. Supportive of this connection, Pope Francis has included the spikenard in his coat of arms. The plant is also mentioned in the Song of Solomon in the Old Testament, \"While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance.\" (1:12 Song of Solomon American Standard Version). Spikenard essential oil was also used by ancient Roman perfumers. \"The plant is said to look like the tail of an ermine. The extracted perfume is an oil used by the Romans for anointing the head. Its great costliness is mentioned by Pliny.\" There are two other versions racemosa) and ploughman's spikenard (Inula conyza), but we are not considering those here. For our purposes we are going to consider only the oil that comes from the Nardostachys jatamansi plant as our spiritual essential oil. It is also easy to confuse spike oil with spikenard essential oil, but please be aware that spike oil comes from lavender and smells like a combination of rosemary and lavender. It is not spikenard essential oil.

The franc in its name refers to the quality, not the French. Commonly known as frankincense to westerners, the resin is known as olibanum, in Arabic al-lubn, meaning \"that which results from milking\" or \"the product resulting from milking the boswellia tree.\" It's spiritual properties make it another one of the best spiritual essential oils. Its name originates from: bodily systems, including the digestive, respiratory, nervous, and excretory systems can also be helped by frankincense essential oil. [It aids the absorption of nutrients](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/heal-digestive-problems-naturally/) and strengthens the immune system. Frankincense essential oil has been found useful for certain health conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, stomach ulcers, asthma, breaking up phlegm, and helping digestive disorders by stimulating gastric juices and bile production. The antiseptic qualities of this medicinal and spiritual essential oil can help prevent bad breath, cavities, toothaches, mouth sores, and other infections. Frankincense essential oil often regulates estrogen production in women and reduces the risk of post-menopausal tumor or cyst formation in the uterus (uterine cancer). It also can regulate the menstrual cycle of premenopausal women. Frankincense essential oil is being studied for its potential to treat cancer. Scientists have observed that there's an agent in this well-known spiritual essential oil that not only stops cancer from spreading, but also induces cancerous cells to close themselves down. Immunologist Mahmoud Suhail is hoping to open a new chapter in the history of frankincense. \"Cancer starts when the DNA code within the cell's nucleus becomes corrupted,\" Dr. Suhail says. \"It seems frankincense has a re-set function. It can tell the cell what the right DNA code should be.\" In a series of clinical and laboratory studies over the last two decades, frankincense and myrrh have shown promise in addressing a number of common disorders. Frankincense has been investigated as a possible treatment for some cancers, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, anxiety, and asthma, among other conditions. If these ancient remedies can indeed provide relief for the many patients who suffer from these potentially devastating illnesses, the great incense roads of antiquity may flourish once again with the help of these strengthening and spiritual essential oils. The concern among some in the scientific community is the presence of boswellic acid, which is not present in Frankincense essential oil, only in frankincense extracts, which contain 40 to 60 percent of boswellic acid. Robert Tisserand writes: \"[I]f you are looking for a [natural substance to help prevent or treat cancer](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/supplements-and-herbs-for-cancer-fighting/), frankincense oil should not be your first choice. Look instead to turmeric/curcumin, to cannabis/cannabinoids, to garlic/garlic oil, and to frankincense extract, which is sold in capsule form. Following that, I would consider essential oils of cinnamon bark, lemongrass, citronella, turmeric, orange, lemon and bergamot.\" My advice is to work with a qualified aroma therapist before trying any of these methods. Only time and research will tell us what the [future of essential oils are in the cure for cancer](http://tisserandinstitute.org/frankincense-oil-and-cancer-in-perspective/). I am looking forward to seeing more results. Background Frankincense, (commonly referred to as olibanum), Boswellia carteri comes from the Boswellia genus trees, particularly Boswellia sacra and Boswellia carteri. After the milky white sap is extracted from the tree bark, it is allowed to harden for several days into a gum resin, after which it is scraped off in perfect tear-shaped droplets. Frankincense is traditionally burned as incense and was charred and ground into a powder to produce the heavy kohl eyeliner by ancient makeup artists and applied to upper class Egyptian women and royalty that classic artwork and Hollywood movies have portrayed. When the resin is steam-distilled, it produces an aromatic essential oil with a bounty of benefits. In ancient Egypt, frankincense was revered as the sweat of the gods\u2014without a doubt, this is a sacred and spiritual essential oil. Remarkably, frankincense resin is edible and is used in traditional medicines in Africa and Asia for digestion and healthy skin. For internal consumption, it is recommended that frankincense be translucent, with no black or brown impurities. It is often light yellow with a (very) slight greenish tint. It is often chewed like gum but is stickier. In Ayurvedic medicine frankincense (Boswellia serrata) is commonly referred to in India as \"dhoop,\" and has been used for hundreds of years as a medicinal and spiritual essential oil for treating arthritis, healing wounds, strengthening the female hormone system and purifying the air. The Greek historian Herodotus was familiar with frankincense and knew it was harvested from trees in southern Arabia. He reported that the gum was dangerous to harvest because of the venomous snakes living in the trees. The method Arabs used to get around this problem was to burn the gum of the styrax tree letting off smoke that would drive the snakes away. Recent studies have indicated that the worldwide frankincense tree populations are declining partly due to over-exploitation. Frequently tapped trees produce seeds that germinate at a rate of 16% while seeds of trees that had not been tapped germinate at a rate of more than 80%. In addition, burning, grazing and attacks by the longhorn beetle have reduced the tree population to an unsafe level of potential extinction. Only responsible farmers who are conscientious about preservation and use sustainable methods for growing and harvesting will keep this sacred tree and it's spiritual essential oil alive for generations to come. As a general rule when using natural products, we should patronize those growers and manufacturers who practice sustainability.
