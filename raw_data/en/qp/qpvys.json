Some of these microorganisms can cause disease, while others are critical for the ongoing health of the immune system, the central nervous system, digestion, and other internal bodily processes.* A healthy gut microbiome is needed to maintain overall health and well-being and may be supported through supplementation.* Gut Health Restore contains ingredients to help promote the growth of healthy intestinal flora. It does this through three potent ingredients from ancient Ayurvedic practices that have also undergone modern clinical research trials. - Neem extract is a potent herb that has been shown to support healthy intestinal flora.* - Vidanga extract is known for its ability to detoxify the body and provide comprehensive support of bodily systems and processes.* - Mimosa pudica extract is known for supporting intestinal and immune health. The extract is made from seeds of the plant that form a sticky gel that binds to the intestinal wall and through natural bodily elimination processes, removes toxins and buildup* The ingredients in Gut Health Restore are congruous with what research suggests to be effective and safe, particularly for supporting intestinal health.* Clinical evidence and research cited herein show that the ingredients in Gut Health Restore may: - Promote a healthy gut microbiome* - Promote healthy intestinal flora* - Promote healthy detoxification* General Disclaimer: *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
