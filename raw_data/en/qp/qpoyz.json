It essentially relied on nature and the immune system of an individual, and therap eutic interventions were introduced only to augment the immune system. yurveda had eight specialties, incl uding psycho-neuroscience (a combination of psychology, clinical psycho logy and psychiatry) and a unique promotive therapy encompassing nutrition, rejuvenation and geriatrics . The symptoms of various brain disorders, including memory diso rder, were well defined. The goal of yurveda was to help an indivi dual to achieve his cherished goal of l eading a healthy life of 100 years. To achieve this, great emphasis was laid on nutri tion, diet and a good conduct by the two great exponents of yurveda viz. Carak and Su ruta. By following these regimens, an individual could lead a less stressful life free from emotional disturbances. Both Carak and Su ruta had believed that these in combination with rasayana (rejuvenating) plants could enable an individual to lead a he althy life of 100 science ( ved) of life ( ayu), is one of the most ancient medical systems of human civilization. It is considered to be an upveda (off-shoot) of Atharvaveda (t he science of well-being) and, thus, has its origin from Veda, the oldest recorded wisdom of India written c. 3500 BCE. A OPEN ACCESSNutrients 2013 , 5 479 science, based essentially on the fundamental laws of nature, yurveda has in its repository extensive knowledge and wisdom about almost each and every aspe ct of diseases and thei r therapeutic approach. The application of yurveda also extended to other economically and socially usef ul living beings. Thus, we also had Hastyurveda , the treatise on treatment of elephants [1-4], Ava-yurveda \u2014a treatise on treatment of horses [5]\u2014and Va-yurveda \u2014the treatise dealing with the cultivation of trees and seasoning of woods to be used in ship building, etc. [6]. Almost all professions practiced in India till medieval time were based not only on ph ysical strength and vigor, but also on mental prowess [7-9]. The game of hunting was greatly en couraged in the royal and warrior classes to revitalize and strengthen bot h the body and brain [10]. Vivid descriptions of trees, plants and other na turally occurring herbs are to be found in all the important treatises of India right from Veda. The epics Ramayan and Mahabharat describe a large numbers of medicinal plants. The magnum opus of the great medieval Indian bard Kalid s, viz. Raghvamamahkvyam, is replete with vivid descriptions of plants beneficial for the treatment of diabetes. The treatise on state-craft, viz. Arthstra, written by K utilya (Ch nakya) also gives a vivid description of medicinal plants and their use and, al so, various diets suitable fo r various professions [11]. All this will give an idea about the importance attached to health and the all pervasive influence of yurveda on life and society in India. This review describes the main tenets and philosophy of yurveda . 1.1. What Is yurveda? Before any mention of nutritive ingredients in yurveda is considered, it becomes imperative to understand certain fundamental tenets of yurveda . The mainstay of yurveda is two sets of original treatises consisting of thr ee books each. These are: (a) Vrhattraayi , i.e., big (600 Laghttrayi Prakaa written in 1500 CE). All these texts cover almost all the v ital aspects of life, health, diseas e and their treatment by adopting a three pronged approach, viz. philosophi cal, holistic and also humanistic. yurveda has advocated a comprehensive composite health care system en compassing promotive, preventive and curative systems of medicine. It has been practiced since ancient times in the form of Astnga yurveda (literally meaning eight-fold yurveda ) and has eight major clinical specialties, viz. Kychikits (internal medicine), lya Tantra (Surgery), lakya (pertaining to the diseases of supra-clavicular regions, i.e., diseases of the eyes, ear, nose and throat), Kumrbhrtya (pediatrics, including obstetrics and gynecology), Bhtvidy (literally meaning demonology, but actually psychology, including clinical psychology and psychiatry), Agd Tantra (toxicology), Rasyan-Tantra (promotive therapy, including nutrition, rejuvenation and Vjikaran (sexology, pertaining to aphrodisiacs). treatise Charaka Samhit [12] in the section Nidnsthnam (Section on Diagnosis\u2014 Chapter VII) has considered mental ill-health as essentially a result of a disequilibrium brought about by the unwholesome interaction between the indi vidual and their surroundi ng environment. This Nutrients 2013 , 5 480 interaction operates through an axis consis ting of three fundamental factors, viz. kla (time rhythm), bddhi (intellect) and indriytha (sensorial inputs). Time rhythm is considered to be the interaction of an individual with the daily expe rience of life. These experiences can vary from being pleasant to extremely unpleasant. The response of the indivi dual to these events must be objective and dispassionate. Any disequilibrium in this axis leads to wide-ranging altered behavior (Figure 1). The common mental ailments classified by Charaka are unmda (psychosis), apsmara (convulsive disorders), cittodveg (anxiety disorders), cittavasada (depressive illness), mada (alcoholism and drug abuse), sanysa (complete indifference to the envi ronment, surroundings and world) and mrch (loss of sensorial inputs, resulting in coma). Besides th eir aetiopathogenesis, Carak has also described signs, symptoms and behavioral alterations in different ps ychiatric disorders and classified them accordingly, which we will consider later. Figure 1. An individual reacts to their surrounding environm ent in a wholesome manner when all the three vital links of the axis, viz. kla (time rhythm), bddhi (intellect) and indriytha (sensorial processing:output) are in harmony, leading to a wholesome mental health. Any disturbance in any one or more than one of the axis leads to a wholesome mental ill-health. 2. yurvedic Concept of Life Span, Health and Brain Aging 2.1. Life Span yurveda , like any other Indian tradition, considered the total life span of an individual to be over one hundred years. The Rig Veda , first of the four Vedas, considered to be the earlie st recorded book of wisdom in human civilization, wishes every individual to lead a healthy life of a hundred years: \"jeevem s\u00e1rdah atam \". In the earlier phase of yurveda , the total life span was divided into the following three categories: blyavasth (childhood): 24 years; yuvvasth (young): 44 years and vidhavasth (old age): 48 years. Thus, total life span wa s considered to be 116 years. However, later Ssuta [13] gave an elaborate and system atic classification of age as follow: Balyavyya (childhood): 0-16 years. kirpa (milkfed), kirannada (weanlings) and annad (fed on cereals). The next stage of life, viz. madhya v ya (middle age), spanned from 16 to 70 years and consisted of four stages, vdhi (period of and hni (period of involution or gradual decline): 41-70 years. The last stage life was vidha vya (old age), which lasted from 71 to 100 years. Nutrients 2013 , 5 481 2.2. Health The conceptual frameworks of health in yurveda are essentially based upon the doctrine operating through the principle of smnya and viea, i.e., Heterology versus Homology. This was further extrapolated by S ruta as loka-puru a smya (equilibrium between an individual-microcosm and cosmos-macrocosm) by estab lishing the continuum between with the tridoika (three-dimensional) bio-triangle of kapha-pitta-v ta. Here it would be pertinent to emphasize that kapha , pitta and vata cannot be translated into one word, as many western scholars and educated I ndians tend to do and translate kapha as phlegm, pitta as bile and vata as wind, thereby giving a most erroneous interpretation. Kapha can be appropriately translated as one of the body humors, which forms the solid substr atum of the body, includ ing immune strength; pitta is another bio-humor, which is responsible for th e entire digestive and metabolic functions; and vta is the bio-humor responsible for ener getic and neural activities [14]. As an ecological balance between soma-srya-anila (moon-sun-air) sustains th e entire universe, the physiological homeostasis (constancy of milieu in terior) of the human body is sustained by a harmonious balance between principal bio-humors su staining the immunity, metabolic, energetic and neural activities. The indi vidual living being is cons idered a miniature replica of the universe and comparatively similar activities are taking place inside the microcosm of the human body as are occurring universally in the macrocosm. Suruta has defined in Chapter XXV of i.e., total-health, in healthy person is he whose humors and metabolic state are in equilibrium, whose functional activities of the tissues and excretory products ( i.e., the physical state) are in balance, and the soul, senses and mind ( i.e., the mental state of the body) feel we ll\" [13]. This comprehensive definition describes both the healthy features of the physical body and physical well being, as well as the states of the sensorial, mental and spiritual qualities of we llbeing. Thus, health was considered as a state of physical, mental, spiritual and sens orial/social wellbeing; a similar definition was later adopted by WHO as \"health is a state of physical, me ntal, social and spiritual well being\". Taking the Su rutu definition of health further, the f ounding fathers of independent India under the Chairmanship of the first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had defined health as \"a positive state of well-being in which harmonious development of physical and mental capacities of the individual leads to the enjoyment of a rich and full life. It is not a negative state of mere absence of disease. Health further implies complete adjustment of the indi vidual to his envi ronment, physical an d social.\" [15]. 2.3. Brain Aging Aging is a generalized systematic involution of a living body, its organs, ti ssues and cells. The brain is considered to be the most vulnerable organ to this aging process, as neurons lack a robust regenerative capacity. Both the great exponents of yurveda and usrtu, cognitive func tion of brain starts decl ining from the fourth decade of life onwards, a nd after the eighth decade of life, the loss of bddhi or decision making capacity becomes imperative, leading to senile deme ntia. Therefore, in order to help fulfill the cherished desire of every human being to live the optimum 100 years of life-span with healthy functioning brain and senses, rasyan rejuvenating therapies were introduced. Nutrients 2013 , 5 482 Aging is associated with various degenerativ e changes like functional hormone deficiency state and accumulation of oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids, which results in interference with normal function and prod uces a decrease in stress responses. Since the inception of civilization, elderly persons have been predominantly more prone to age-related brain degenerative disorders than actual gross somatic aging. Hence, yurveda introduced a unique appro ach to diet and nutrients and a rasyan rejuvenating therapy to decelerate aging and manage geriatric problems [16]. Though the use of rasyan was primarily to impart longevity and promote a healthy prolonged life-span, the primary attribute of rasyan is nutrition, i.e., overall nourishment of body. This primary effect of nourishing the body results in longevity and decelerating the process of aging. Hence, it has been advocated that rasyan should be used throughout life, especi ally in early and middle ages [17]. Different yurvedic texts have prescribed selected rasyna suitable for different age groups. By using this approach, a phys ician can prevent or minimi ze specific age-related loss es. It has been suggested that an individual loses one important physiological attribute of life every d ecade after the completion of childhood. The fourth and ninth decades of human life have been considered to be crucial for brain-aging. The rasyans are thus selected for respective decad es: (a) promote, prolong or maintain a desired effect, especially in the early decades of life and (b) prevent loss in the later decades of life (Table 1). Table 1. Different rasyans to be taken in differe nt decades of life [18].

Brahmi (Bacopa monniera ; family: ; family: Scrophulariacae). Nutrients 2013 , 5 483 3. Diet and Nutrition 3.1. Diet and Health in Carak-Samhit Chapter V of the Strasthnam (Fundamentals) of Carak-Samhit [12] is specifically devoted to the quantity of diet and dincary (daily routine) and Chapter VI to the quality of diet and itucary (mode of living in different seasons). Ca raka had emphasized that following the dincary and itucary regimens, one can ensure good physical and mental health and longevity. The quantity of food, dependent upon the power of digestion and the quantity of food that gets digested in time without disturbi ng normalcy, should be considered as the measure of proper quantity. The food taken in proper quantity definitely provides strength, complexion and a happy life to a person without vitiating his normal physiological functions. For healthy living, Caraka has advised that a wise person should meticulously follow the duties relating to his own body in the same way as a civic au thority is conscientious of his duties to the city and a charioteer to those of the chariot. Caraka had not prescribed any univ ersal diet, but advocated that an individual should be the best judge of his own diet and should eat only that f ood the leads to the promotion of physical health, mental prowess and complexion a ccording to different seasons. 3.2. Diet and Health in Su rta-Samhit Like Caraka, Su rta has also laid emphasis on itucary (seasonal regimen). Chapter 6 of Stra-Sthnam (Fundamentals, Plastic-Surgery & Phar maceutical Considerations) is devoted to itucary. The lunar year of yurveda , consisting of twelve months, was s ub-divided into two solstices, viz. southern and northern. Out of the two, the southe rn solstice includes the rainy, autumn and early winter seasons. During these season s, the moon has ascendancy, as the sun is further away from the axis of the earth. As a result, the tastes get concentrated in the plants of both medicinal and food value, and therefore, every living being progressively becomes stronger. In contrast, during the northern solstices, which include winter, spring and summer, th ere is ascendency of the sun and, hence, bitter, astringent and pungent tastes become prominent; this results in the depletion of medicinal and nutrition values of plants and leads to a gradual decl ine in the strength of every living being. The food partaken should be such that it gives rise to exhilaration, physical strength and vigor, mental competence, nourishment, energy, satisfac tion and pleasure. The food taken in proper amounts is digested easily and maintains the equilibrium of dhtus (principal body tissues) and doas (humors or biofactors c ontrolling body physiology). Thus, yurveda , lays a great deal of emphasis on leading a healthy life by following dincary, itcary and partaking of a nutritious and wholesome diet. Such a regimen helps an individual to fulfill his cherished goal of leading a healthy life of 100 years (Figure 2). Nutrients 2013 , 5 484 Figure 2. yurveda advocates the regular use of a w holesome diet, which will help an individual to achieve his cherished goal of leading a healthy life of 100 years. WHOLESOME DIET IMPROVED NUTRITION SERIES OF SECONDARY ATTRIBUTES 3.3. Bhtvidy (Psychology, including Clinic al Psychology and Psychiatry) Bhtvidy was an important, advanced and evolved branch of Atnga-yurveda . It had described mental (Figure 3), psychiatric (Figure 4) and psychological (Fig ure 5) disorders caused purely by mental disorders and a combination of phys ical and mental di sorders (Figure 6).

Rasayana and Treatment of Psychiatric Disorder The various drugs used for the treatment of mental health are classified as medhya ras yans. These act as brain tonics and adaptogens and are specific molecular nutrients for the brain promoting health, thus leading to the alleviation of various behavioral disorders, incl uding memory impairment. The medhya ras yans afford biological nourishme nt of the brain, produc ing tranquility of mind, mental concentration an d promotion of memory. 4.1. The Rasayana Concept In yurveda , rasyan (or science of rejuvenation) is a unique concept and is one of the eight specialized branches of Atng-yurveda . The main object of rasyan therapy is the management of age-related disorders. The prin cipal physiological effect of rasyan is to improve and revitalize the physiological and endocrine functions of the body, to decelerate the aging process and to make an individual more responsive and resistant to disease, i.e., to improve body functi on by strengthening the immune system (Figures 7 and 8). The rasyans are postulated to act thro ugh a psycho-endocrinological immune axis [17]. Nutrients 2013 , 5 487 Figure 7. The three-dimensional effect of rasyan. Figure 8. The rejuvenation channel of Rasyan effect. 4.2. cara-Rasyan (Rejuvenating Code of Conduct) It is pertinent to emphasize that besides a nutritious diet, practice of chra-rasyan (rejuvenation through proper code of conduct) was al so strictly advocated (Figure 9). In essence, Rasyan, or science of rejuvenation, deals primar ily with geriatric problems and lays great emphasis on specific measures to improve the physical, physiologi cal and psychological adaptation to various pathological changes related to the problems of aging. It considers aging as a gradual decline in the adaptive beha vior of an individual to environm ental changes. Several scientific studies conducted to ev aluate the effects of cra rasyan, diet and treatment have revealed clinical improvements and significant positive alterations in specific biochemical parameters, like plasma cortisol, catechol and indole amines, etc. The EEG studies have revealed accentuation of alpha and beta waves and diminution in spikes of delta waves. It provides significant improvement and Nutrients 2013 , 5 488 correction in the physiological and endocrine func tions of the body and makes an individual more responsive and responsive to various geriatri c diseases by augmenting body immunity [19-23]. Figure 9. An aspirant who lives such a life and practices sadchr (good conduct) achieves the rasyan effect, immunity, longevity and intellectual power. He is free from emotional disturbances, is less stressful, has pronounced an abolic static and, thus, leads a happy and healthy life. Archana and Namashiyam [24] have shown significan t alterations in humoral basis in control and swimming-induced stressed rats when treated with the roots of Withania somnifera (Figure 10a,b).

Medhya -Rasayana (Memory Enhancing and Rejuvenating) Plants There are various classifications of ras\u00e1yan\u00e1s , i.e., according to the mode of administration (Carak) or site of action (S rutu), etc. Here, we are concerned with medhy rasyan used for rejuvenation of brain and mental health a nd to promote intelle ct and memory. The names of plants used for treatment of mental disorders have varied in various te xts and have been summarized in an authoritative contemporary text [22] in Table 2. Table 2. A list of plants used in yurvedic medical practice to treat mental disorders. Sl. No. Botanical Nomenclature yurvedic Nomenclature Family , 5 490 Thus, we find that there have been several plants traditionally used for thousands of years as rasyan in yurveda . Several of them have a very interesti ng antioxidant profile of activities [25]. Some authors have postulated that because of the pronounced anti-oxidant activity, rasyan plants would be effective in treating several reactive oxygen species mediated disorders, like memory impairment, senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type and Parkinson's disease [26]. Bacopa monniera We shall illustrate the unique properties of the rasyan plants by taking the example of Bacopa monniera . It is an extremely important plant of yurveda used since the time of Rig-Veda ( c. 3500 BCE), and its name is derived from Lord Brahm , the creator of universe in Hindu mythology and believed to be the originator of yurveda [27]. As has been shown in Table 1, Bacopa has been recommended in various yurvedic texts to be taken during each decade of life after the first decade. It has been classified as medhya-ras yan (memory enhancing and rejuvenating), as well as aindra-ras yan (increasing longevity and promoting proge ny). Because of its traditional importance and unique traditional therapeutic claims of allevi ating old age and age-related diseases, promoting memory and intellect, enhancing life-span, providi ng nourishment, excellence, clarity of voice, complexion and luster and being efficacious in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, like hallucination, schizophrenia, obses sive compulsive disorder, severe psychosis and also producing a photographic memory, it has been inves tigated in different laboratories in India, particularly in the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow. We will take the medhya-rasayana properties later. The aindra-ras yan effect has been negligibly investigated, except perhaps for a M.D. ( yurveda ) thesis by Diggavi [28]. The methodology used in the thesis is not very sound, chiefly because an unstandardized bacopa powder was administered to 10 patients randomly selected from the OPD of the Vjikarana (Sexology) section of the Kaychikitsa department of Integrated Post-Graduate Teaching and Research in yurveda (IPGTRA) of Gujarat yurveda University, Jamnagar. All the patients were fulfilling the clinical yurvedic criteria of diagnosis of Klaiby (Male Sexual Dysfunction). The total course of treatment was 30 days with 5g of bacopa powder three times a day with milk. The study was open-ended. Although increase in several paramete rs, including semen parameters, were observed, these were not significant. However, marked in crease was observed with bacopa treatment on the sexual health in several parameters on an arbitrarily chosen subjective scale. Overall, bacopa treatment showed a varying degree of improve ment in the volunteers (Figure 12). This aspects merits further investigation befo re the traditional claim of bacopa being an aindra-ras yan can be accepted scientifically. However, because of the investigations done at CDRI, the traditional claim of bacopa being medhya-ras yan has been scientifically accepted. A systematic chemical investigation of the plant by Basu et al. [29,30] and Chatterjee et al. [31] revealed Bacopa of the ethanolic extract was traced to the mixture of the triterpenoid saponins designated as Bacosides A and B. Bacoside A is levo-rotatory and Bacoside B is dextro-rotatory. Nutrients 2013 , 5 491 Figure 12. Overall effect of b acopa treatment [28]. 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45% Marked Improvement Significant Improvement ImprovementPercentage of Patients showing improvement Bacoside A was the major component of the plant and comprised two sets of saponins. One set was derived from pseudojujubogenin, which upon aci d hydrolysis furnishe d four triterpenoid transformation products, viz. Bacogenins A 1, A 2, A 3 and A 4 [32]. The second se t of saponins was derived from jujubogenin, which upon acid hydrolysis yi elded two triterpenoids w ith triene side chains as transformation products. These triterpenoi ds were designated as Bacogenins A 4 (trans ) and ( cis). A standardized extract of bacopa containing a mini mum of 55% \u00b1 5% of bacosides with an optimum concentration of Bacogenins (especially Bacogenin A 4), vis-a-vis memory enhancing effect, was developed. This was termed as bacosides-enriched standardized extract of bacopa (BESEB CDRI-08). To begin with, the BESEB CDRI-08 wa s tested in a critically selected learning model, which would produce well-distributed and exte nsive cellular changes during lear ning discrimination and involve a reversal of innate behavi or. For instance, rodents being nocturnal animals prefer dark ness in preference to light. If the learning model is such that an entry of the experimental animal in the lighted alley of the training maze escapes punishment and an entry in th e dark alley is punished, then the model would serve the purpose of reversing the innate behavior of a preference of darkness. The model thus chosen was a foot-shock motivated brightness discrimina tion task on rats in a semi-automatic Y-maze described in detail by [33-35]. It is also important to use a battery of diversified tests whenever attempting to measure the effect of any drug on the level of motivation or emotion [36] . Hence, the memory enhancing effects of BESEB CDRI-08 were evaluated in a battery of tests consisting of positive (reward), as well as negative (punishment), reinforcements, on the labile phase of memory (when the memory is in formative stage) and stable phase of memory (when the memory formation has taken place). The training methods should also allow a clear demarcatio n of the three memory phases, vi z. acquisition, consolidation and retention, and also clearly disti nguish between the successive stages of short-term, intermediate and long-term memories. The foot-shock motivated bright ness discrimination reaction fulfilled most of these criteria in as far as the training was comp leted in one session to produce a labile memory formation and it was with a negative reinforcement ( punishment). However, to obtain predictive and confirmative evidence, the BESEB CDRI-08 was tested in other learning models of active avoidance Nutrients 2013 , 5 492 response and Sidman's continuous avoidance respons e (to produce a stable phase of memory with negative reinforcement in multi-session or interval sessions) and conditioned taste aversion response (to produce a labile phase of memo ry with positive reinforcement). The result of these investigations confirmed th at BESEB CDRI-08 has a significant facilitatory effect on all the forms of memory, i.e., short, intermediate and long-te rm memories in all the three phases, viz. acquisition, cons olidation and retention [37-44]. Recent studies have shown that BESEB CCDRI-08 influenced the serotonergic system by elevating the level 5-HT and up-regul ating the expression of 5-HT 3A receptor, possibly by interacting with the cholinergic system [38]. The improvement observed in the hippocampus-dependent learning model was possibly due to the combined effect of se rotonergic and cholinergic systems. This is in conformity with other findings that multiple neurot ransmitters are involved in the learning memory process [39-42,45-49]. BESEB CDRI-08 was found to be safe in regulatory sub-acute toxi city [50] and teratogenicity studies [51]. No abnormalities were observed in genotoxicity and mu tagenicity [52]. The product was efficacious in the treatment of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactive disorder [53] and adults suffering from age-associated memory impairment [54-56] (Figures 13 and 14).

Conclusion yurveda in essence relies substantially on nature, and it is only to provide assistance to nature that drug and other therapeutic measures are applied. yurveda also relies on swabhvoparma (recession by nature) and dietics, and drug regimens are based on this principle. The therapeutic approach is based on samodhana (preventive and curative) measures by augmenting the natural resistance of the patient. Besides the unique branch of rasyan, due emphasis has also been laid down on the code of good conduct to lead a healthy and long life. Diseas es can be prevented by following a proper daily routine and seasonal living. The rich repository of unique efficacious plants mentioned in yurveda has elicited a significant hope in current drug discovery research, which is characterized by a target-rich and lead-poor scenario [55,56]. Increased interest is being witnessed at a gl obal scale to evolve drug discovery strategies based on natu ral products and traditio nal medicine, and it is being increasingly realized that development of new drugs need not al ways be restricted to new molecular entities [57]. In recent years, health planners and practitioners are recognizing the value of traditional medical systems like yurveda [58]. The medicinal plants fr om indigenous pharmacopoeias like the compendia of Caraka and Su rta have shown significant healing power and have been postulated to be effective in a wide variety of diseases, rangi ng from allergic rhinitis [59], cancer [60] to Alzheimer's disease [61]. As a result of a global interest of vast dimens ion in herbal products, many plant-based products under the guise of food suppl ements have entered the markets of the USA and other We stern countries. These have been termed nutraceu ticals containing many plants lack ing in botanical verification, besides evidence for efficacy or safety. This problem is further compounded by the fact at present that Nutrients 2013 , 5 494 there is no globally accepted regulato ry guidelines to ensure that these herbal products are what they claim, are as efficacious as claimed and, most importantly, how safe they are. The bacopa extract designated BESEB CD RI-08 is derived from an important rasyan plant, which has been in use in the Indian system of medi cine sine 3000 BCE. It is a standardized extract of the authentic identified plant, found to be effi cacious in improving cognitive functions in a wide variety of test situations; the standardization pa rameters are well defined and regulatory toxicity studies have shown it to be safe. The yurvedic concept of diet and good conduct provi des another traditional basis of good health and it would be worthwhile to do some research in this direction. Several studies have shown that practicing a good conduct of behavior combined w ith a nutritious diet and treatment with rasyan plants lead to a highly significant improvement in combating various geriatric diseases and augmenting body immunity [19-23]. yurvedic texts have described in vivid detail a ve ry wide array of ingredients, including a proper moral code of conduct and personal hygi ene, to lead a long, healthy lif e with enhanced brain functions.
