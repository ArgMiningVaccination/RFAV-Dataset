Indonesian Papua - Avoid non-essential travel [Avoid non-essential travel](#levels) to all the provinces of Indonesia Papua due to the regular occurrence of violent incidents, threats made against foreigners by militant groups and risk of kidnapping. Mount Agung - Avoid non-essential travel [Avoid non-essential travel](#levels) to within 10 km of Mount Agung due to possible volcanic eruption. Safety and security Indonesian Papua Political tension and regular violent incidents continue to occur in Indonesian Papua. In February 2023, militant groups threatened to attack and take hostages, specifically referencing foreigners. You may also face increased threats of violence or kidnapping if you travel to Indonesian Papua. Labour disputes at the Freeport-McMoRan mine near Timika have led to demonstrations, public transportation disruptions and violence. Fatal attacks have occurred on roads near the mine. Foreigners have been targeted by local militants. There is a heightened police and military presence in this area. Terrorism There is a threat of terrorism in Indonesia. While effective counterterrorism measures by Indonesian authorities are in place, terrorist cells are active and have the capacity to carry out attacks throughout the country. Attacks have targeted: - military and government facilities - tourist attractions and popular public places - nightclubs and entertainment venues - public transportation - airports Further attacks are likely, and terrorists may also target: - crowded places - places with high pedestrian traffic and where foreigners may gather - commercial establishments - local government offices - public transit stations - busy streets - long lineups at tourist attractions - places of worship Stay at hotels that have robust security measures, including metal detectors, guards and security cameras. Keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations cannot be considered completely free of risk. Be particularly vigilant during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks. - Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places and identify ways to leave the area in case of emergency - Monitor local media - Follow the instructions of the local authorities Crime Violent crime Violent crime, such as armed robberies, occurs regularly. Be particularly cautious on the road from Banda Aceh to Medan, where armed robberies have occurred. Foreigners travelling alone and those travelling at night are at particular risk. Standards of police services differ considerably from those in Canada. - Avoid showing signs of affluence - Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times - If you're travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors locked Petty crime Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs throughout Indonesia, specifically in tourist areas, such as Bali and Lombok. Criminals sometimes force people to withdraw cash from ATMs. Merchants don't always honour pricing agreements. Use good judgment in engaging services of tourist guides, especially in places that tourists rarely visit. Kidnapping There is a threat of kidnapping, particularly in the provinces of Indonesian Papua and Aceh province. Foreign travellers have been kidnapped and killed. Terrorist groups have also kidnapped tourists in East and West Kalimantan. - Be extra vigilant if travelling in these areas - Avoid travelling alone and after dusk - Use varied routes and schedules when moving from one place to another Women's safety Women travelling alone may face some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Demonstrations Demonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Political and social tension There are long-standing sectarian and social tensions throughout Indonesia, particularly in the provinces of: - Central Sulawesi, in Palu, Poso and Tentena - Maluku, especially in Ambon - Indonesian Papua Sectarian violence targeting civilians has occurred. The potential for violence remains, despite ongoing security operations efforts from local authorities. Be aware of your surroundings. Fraud There is a very high rate of credit and debit card fraud in Indonesia, including online fraud. When using debit or credit cards: - pay careful attention if other people are handling your cards - use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business - avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature - cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN - check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements Romance scams If you're travelling to Indonesia to meet someone you've only met online, keep it mind that you may be the victim of a scam. Be wary of unsolicited emails or requests for a wire transfer. Don't send money to someone you have never met in person. Spiked food and drinks Even if the wrapping or container appears intact, snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. - Be wary of accepting these items from new acquaintances - Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers People have died after drinking methanol-adulterated alcohol. Counterfeits of well-known alcohol brands often contain dangerous amounts of methanol. Poisoning incidents have happened at hotels, bars, and shops in tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra. - Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol - Be wary of lesser-known or illegal brands - Avoid buying alcohol from individuals - Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick Road safety Road conditions and road safety vary greatly throughout the country. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season. Road travel in Indonesia can be very challenging due to: - reckless driving - perilous road conditions - inadequate lighting - poor signage - high traffic congestion If you plan to rent a car, consider hiring a driver. Avoid driving after dark outside of major cities or major roads as some drivers do not use lights. You may face mob anger if you are involved in an accident that causes serious injury. In such cases, remain in your vehicle and wait for a police officer to arrive. Motorcycles and scooters Motorcycle and scooter accidents are the main cause of death and serious injury among foreigners visiting many parts of Indonesia, including Bali. Rental motorcycles are also often targeted and stolen. In such cases, you may have to pay the replacement cost for a new motorcycle. Public transport Public transport can be crowded and safety standards are poor. Many remote parts of Indonesia have poor transportation networks. Buses Crashes involving overcrowded buses are common. Large buses are generally available only on Java. Minibuses are available elsewhere. If you choose to travel by bus, - keep in mind that minibus drivers may try to overcharge foreigners - keep your belongings secure due to pickpocketing Taxis The condition of taxis varies. Foreign travellers using taxis have been victims of armed robbery, either by the driver or other passengers. - Pre-arrange transportation with a safe and reliable taxi company - Only use a taxi company whose vehicles are equipped with a meter - Never enter a cab if it already has one or more passengers - Don't hail taxis off the street and avoid using unmarked taxi services Reliable taxis are available from Bluebird, Thunderbird and Express. Be careful of \"lookalike\" taxis from competitors. Ferries Ferry accidents are common and are often caused by poor safety practices or extreme weather conditions. If you choose to travel by ferry: - make sure the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment and that life jackets are provided for all passengers and accessible at all times - don't board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy - verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

Routine vaccines Be sure that your [routine vaccinations](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations.html), as per your [province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information.html), are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination. Some of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others. Pre-travel vaccines and medications You may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary. Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements [Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito. Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection. Risk - There is no risk of yellow fever in this country. Country Entry Requirement* - Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from a country [where yellow fever occurs.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022)) Recommendation - Vaccination is not recommended. - Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional. - Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre)well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination. [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre ) * It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d) of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements. Hepatitis A [Hepatitis A](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/hepatitis-a) is a disease of the liver spread through contaminated food and water or contact with an infected person. All those travelling to regions with a risk of hepatitis A infection should get vaccinated. Measles [Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles. Japanese encephalitis [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/japanese-encephalitis.html) is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain. It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling. Travellers are at higher risk if they will be: - travelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days) - making multiple trips to endemic areas - staying for extended periods in rural areas - visiting an area suffering a JE outbreak - engaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists) Hepatitis B [Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a disease of the liver spread through blood or other bodily fluids. Travellers who may be exposed (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) should get vaccinated. Influenza Seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) occurs worldwide. The flu season usually runs from November to April in the northern hemisphere, between April and October in the southern hemisphere and year round in the tropics. Influenza (flu) is caused by a virus spread from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Get the flu shot. Malaria [Malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html) is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes. There is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination. [Antimalarial medication may be recommended](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html) depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving. [Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times: Cover your skin and use an [approved](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html) insect repellent on uncovered skin. Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows. Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area. Wear permethrin-treated clothing. If you develop [symptoms](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria/symptoms-malaria.html) similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living. Rabies In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take [precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/prevention.html), including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children. If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment. Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals). Polio [Polio ](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/polio)(poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country. Polio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune. Recommendations: - Be sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the [routine vaccine schedule](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-13-recommended-immunization-schedules.html#p1c12a2)for children in Canada. - One booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an [adult](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-9-immunization-travellers.html#a3). COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. Before travelling, verify your destination's COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Safe food and water precautions Many illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water. - Learn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our [eat and drink safely abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water)page.

It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions. The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling. Typhoid [Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time. Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination. Schistosomiasis [Schistosomiasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis) can be spread to humans through freshwater sources contaminated by blood flukes (tiny worms). The eggs of the worms can cause stomach illnesses like diarrhea and cramps or urinary problems. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Avoid swimming in freshwater sources (lakes, rivers, ponds). There is no vaccine available for schistosomiasis. Insect bite prevention Many diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present: - Use insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin - Cover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester - Minimize exposure to insects - Use mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed To learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our [insect bite prevention](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) page. Find out what types of insects are present where you're travelling, when they're most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread. Chikungunya There is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The risk may vary between regions of a country. [Chikungunya](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/chikungunya.html) is a virus spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Chikungunya can cause a viral disease that typically causes fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years. Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times. There is no vaccine available for chikungunya. Lymphatic filariasis [Lymphatic filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis), also known as elephantiasis, is caused by filariae (tiny worms) spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause a range of illnesses. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine available for lymphatic filariasis although drug treatments exist. Dengue - In this country, [dengue](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/infectious-diseases/viral-haemorrhagic-fevers/dengue-fever.html)is a risk to travellers. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites. - Dengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal. - The level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region. - Mosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset. [Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html). There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue. Zika virus [Zika virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus.html) is a risk in this country. Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause [serious birth defects](https://canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus/pregnant-planning-pregnancy.html).

If your male partner travelled with you, wait 3 months after travel or after onset of illness due to Zika virus (whichever is longer). - Men: Wait 3 months after travel to this country or after onset of illness due to Zika virus (whichever is longer) before trying for a pregnancy. For more travel recommendations, see the travel health notice: [Zika virus: Advice for travellers](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/152) Animal precautions Some infections, such as [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves. Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game. Closely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals. Avian Influenza Human cases of avian influenza have been reported in this destination. [Avian influenza](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/avian-influenza) is a viral infection that can spread quickly and easily among birds and in rare cases it can infect mammals, including people. The risk is low for most travellers. Avoid contact with birds, including wild, farm, and backyard birds (alive or dead) and surfaces that may have bird droppings on them. Ensure all poultry dishes, including eggs and wild game, are properly cooked. Travellers with a higher risk of exposure include those: - visiting live bird/animal markets or poultry farms - working with poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks) - hunting, de-feathering, field dressing and butchering wild birds and wild mammals - working with wild birds for activities such as research, conservation, or rehabilitation - working with wild mammals, especially those that eat wild birds (e.g., foxes) All eligible people are encouraged to get the seasonal influenza shot, which will protect them against human influenza viruses. While the seasonal influenza shot does not prevent infection with avian influenza, it can reduce the chance of getting sick with human and avian influenza viruses at the same time. Person-to-person infections Stay home if you're sick and practise proper [cough and sneeze etiquette](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene), which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the [flu](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) and other illnesses by: - [washing your hands often](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html) - avoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at [large-scale events](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings?_ga=2.29124287.266168822.1670858124-1284851353.1649443099)(concerts, sporting events, rallies) - avoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness [Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/sexually-transmitted-infections.html), [HIV](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hiv-aids.html), and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your [local public health authority](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/mpox/symptoms-management.html) pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine. Tuberculosis [Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs. For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low. Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional. High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives. Medical services and facilities Heath care is inadequate. Most medical staff don't speak English or French. You may have to pay in advance, in cash, to obtain medical services. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and you may need it in case of serious illness or injury. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays. Laws and culture You must abide by local laws. Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention). [Overview of the criminal law system in Indonesia](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories/overview-of-the-criminal-law-system-in-indonesia) Drugs Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences. They can also be detained for long periods, without the possibility of release on bail, while police conduct investigations prior to prosecution. Police have arrested tourists after random drug testing throughout the country. Medicine Some prescription and over-the-counter medications that are legal in Canada, such as those containing morphine and codeine, are classified as controlled substances in Indonesia. It's illegal to bring them into the country, even in small quantities, without prior permission from the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the required documentation. If you attempt to bring banned pharmaceuticals into Indonesia without prior authorization and proper documentation, Indonesian authorities may confiscate them. You may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. Sharia law In some areas, Islamic practices and beliefs closely adhere to local customs, laws and regulations. Religious police enforce sharia law in Aceh. Specific applications of sharia may differ by region and apply to non-Muslims as well. Be aware of the relevant provisions specifically related to the region, regardless of your religion. Dress and behaviour To avoid offending local sensitivities: - dress conservatively - behave discreetly - respect religious and social traditions Ramadan In 2024, the lunar month of Ramadan is expected to begin on or around March 10. In public, between sunrise and sunset, be discreet when: - drinking - eating - smoking 2SLGBTQI+ travellers Indonesian national law doesn't criminalize sexual acts or relationships between persons of the same sex. However, they are prohibited and punishable under local laws in some provinces. In Aceh, Sharia law is enforced and sexual acts between Muslim individuals of the same sex is punished by caning. They could also face arrest under charges related to immoral behaviour, prostitution or social ills. 2SLGBTQI+ travellers could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. 2SLGBTQI+ individuals should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Indonesia. [Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel) Dual citizenship Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Indonesia.

Indonesia allows minors to carry dual citizenship until the age of 18. After this time, they must choose between their Indonesian citizenship and foreign citizenship. [General information for travellers with dual citizenship](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship) International Child Abduction The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Indonesia. If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Indonesia by an abducting parent: - act as quickly as you can - consult a lawyer in Canada and in Indonesia to explore all the legal options for the return of your child - report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre. If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies. Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.

Natural disasters and climate Indonesia is located in a very active seismic zone. It's prone to a multitude of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, volcanic eruptions and drought. Earthquakes and tsunamis Each year, Indonesia experiences thousands of earthquakes of varying magnitudes, some triggering tsunamis. Deaths, injuries and significant damage occasionally occur. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.

[Tsunami alerts](https://www.tsunami.gov/)- U.S. Tsunami Warning System Volcanoes Indonesia has 129 active volcanoes and periodically experiences major volcanic events. Volcanic events can be dangerous, even life-threatening. Ash clouds can disrupt air travel, including on the island of Bali, and cause or worsen respiratory problems. The Indonesian Directorate of Volcanology monitors active volcanoes to provide residents with an early warning should unusual activity occur. Local authorities can raise alert levels and order evacuations on short notice. If you are travelling to an active volcano area: - take official warnings seriously and respect exclusion zones - monitor local media to stay up-to-date on latest developments - follow the advice of local authorities Useful links Rainy season The rainy season extends from November to March, but heavy rains are common throughout the year. Flooding and landslides can occur with little warning, especially in remote areas where extensive deforestation is common, but also in major cities, including Jakarta. Such incidents have led to fatalities and destruction of property. Seasonal flooding can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. - Be aware of health risks associated with flood waters - Keep informed of regional weather forecasts as well as road closures or detours - Avoid disaster areas - Follow the advice of local authorities [Tornadoes, cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons and monsoons](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/hurricanes-typhoons-cyclones-monsoons) Air pollution Unrestricted burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan sometimes causes air pollution to rise to unhealthy levels, especially from June to October.
