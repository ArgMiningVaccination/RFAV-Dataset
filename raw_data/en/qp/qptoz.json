Many times when a person is prescribed chemicals, the person is given a mask to cover what is happening to the body. Not many of the holistic options have side effects. The holistic options can provide a stronger and longer lasting healing foundation. This journey to holistic healing and healthly living started when I was around sixteen years old. A friendship with a very down to earth friend brought forth information as to why I was not feeling good physically and how my eating habits needed to change. Even today, I still enjoy those home baked cookies, but I am not near that weight I was at 16. I slimmed down, and my overall health is very good. While I was becoming aware of the foods that I was consuming, I began to learn about the different effects that the products on the store shelves have on our bodies. I also realized that many work environments are toxic and how I needed to protect myself better when I was there. Our food, the environment and our thinking patterns create an effect on how our human bodies react on a daily basis. When any one of these factors is not being looked after, we experience ill health and discomfort on many levels. This can be physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. My body and mind have been a walking testament of how I am living. From having a bunion on my foot that was very painful to migraines that had me taking painkillers, I realized that I needed to make some more changes in my life. Today, after years of finding alternative resources and healthier options, I am headache free, have a much higher vibrational level and am very happy. I am no longer scared to travel due to discomforts or fears of getting sick. I hope this book will help you out, the same way the information helped me out over the years. With this, I have so much gratitude for being able to live on such an amazing planet that can provide our bodies with so many healthy options and healing tools. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: I am not a doctor, herbalist or a naturopath. I cannot personally advise anyone of what they should take or what therapies they need. My background is the practising of Reiki and other forms of energy work. I will not take any personal responsibility for your health and well-being. You are the one that is stepping forward and seeking amazing ways of healing naturally. I suggest that you use this as a handbook to further your research to find out what can be used naturally to assist in enhancing your life in all areas of well-being: emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually. I had a lot of fun finding out what everything did for my body, including the vitamins, minerals, omega oils and more. WARNING: If you are on any prescribed medication or therapies, you need to get confirmation from your licensed practitioner or naturopath first before taking any additional vitamins, minerals, herbs or oils. This book was prepared to get you interested in what you are placing on the table and what can enhance your health at the same time as pleasing your taste buds. Along with healthy eating to heal the body, we can have fun preparing safe cleansers and body products to use with a lot of the herbs and fruits listed in the book. Have fun discovering the blessings of Mother Earth. Blessing to you on your journey to a healthier lifestyle and well-being. Dedication I would love to dedicate this book to my teenage friend Rocco, my children, grandchildren, Cousin Shelley and Mother Earth. When I was about sixteen years old, I met an amazing young lady named Rocco. She got me thinking about what I was eating and how it was affecting my health and weight. I started to slim down and feel a lot more energetic. My children's sensitivities to food, chemicals in cleaning products and processed foods opened another door of experiences. When they came home after eating food laced with food dyes or sugar, I knew I had to be patient till it wore off. My grandchildren also showed signs of sensitivities to flowers, food colouring and materials used in clothing. We had to be careful what one was wearing and what food they were consuming. My cousin, Shelley, was the one that really introduced me to the power of herbal medicine. I still remember the day she gave me a herbal combination to help my stomach. It took me about two months before I finally tried the herbs. This herbal product helped my stomach to heal and work properly again. This took me down the path of learning how our food is our medicine, especially the fruits, herbs, legumes, nuts, oils, seeds and vegetables. Thank you to my amazing family and friends who have walked this path with me and have taught me so much in one way or the other. You all are a huge blessing! Chapter 1 Holistic Healing Techniques The original settlers of all the countries around the world had amazing forms of healing. They used the medicines and energies of the land and spirit realm for healing the mind, body and soul. Working with Mother Earth and connecting with God/Creator brought many healing techniques that the medicine men and medicine women learned to use. These teachings were passed on to people in the community who had the same soul path. The children who were destined for this path of healing were taught at a very early age. This information that they learned was also shared among the other communities around the world. A lot of the teachings were lost due to the fact that healing options were taken away from the indigenous peoples and those who were called witches and the right to live with Mother Earth. In the the east in countries like China, India and Japan: many of the healing techniques were retained and are still being used to this day. They shared acupuncture, acupressure and the knowledge of working with the body's meridians along with incorporating herbs and healthier energy practices. In India, there was the use of meditation and Ayurveda medicines, which included food planning. All above healing methods taught one how to heal the body, mind and spirit. In the early 1970s, some of the eastern healing techniques started to come back to the west in both Canada and the United States. This started with meditations, massage therapy and chiropractic work. At this time, more books were being published on how the plants of the earth could be used as a medicine instead of the chemicals that were being used by the pharmaceutical companies. In 2016, there are so many ways of practising holistic healing that it is hard to keep up with all the new techniques. This chapter is to share some of the healing techniques that are available to us today. Each will have a brief description, and it is up to you to research more on what you are most intrigued and comfortable with. We don't all enjoy the same teachings or ideas, yet now have many options to choose from. If you are unsure, try something out see how it reacts with you and the changes it brings to you. I have tried a few techniques. My favourite healing techniques are the following: essential oils, herbs, Reiki and reflexology. What are yours? One should never take ownership of a disease. Refrain from saying things like: my diabetes, my asthma, my sick cell. Start the healing process by putting it out into the universe and with your body that this discomfort is only temporarily. That illness does not belong to you. Focus on the positive steps you will make to release any sickness from your body.

Accessing Bars A neuroscientist, Dr. Fannin, found that there are thirty-two bars in the head that connect your thoughts and attitudes. When the bars are not cleared, we are healed back. When working with the bars, a person is able to release thought patterns that we have been holding onto from other lives, whether it be financial success, health, creativity or more. This healing technique was started in the 1990s, now being taught around the world. Acutonics Acutonics is done with tuning forks that are calibrated to the frequencies and harmonic resonances of the celestial bodies. Known as the Music of the Spheres, the vibrations of the tuning forks resonates with every cell in our body and helps to provide healing to the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment involving the use of fine needles. The needles stimulate the meridians of the body. This helps to increase the flow of Qi, essential to the well-being of the spiritual, mental, physical and emotional state. Acupuncture is used to relieve headaches, depression, reduces allergies and works with the emotional well-being. Akashic Records The Akashic records hold the information on your past lives and provides the information on how you can release the patterns that have repeated themselves from lifetime to lifetime. These patterns can show emotional abuse - mental - physical, anger, fear, frustration, physical ailments and unhealthy belief systems. When the records are accessed on your behalf, the healing work is interactive, and you can take a conscious part in seeing the events, healing and releasing the patterns and emotions. Aromatherapy Essential oils are used for aromatherapy. The oils are infused into the air so that it can be spread over a larger area. The oils can be used for their antibacterial to help clean the air. The oils can bring a pleasant smell to the air and provide a relaxing energy. The use of aromatherapy is a lot safer for the environment than the use of air refreshers and disinfectants that are made with chemicals that cause damage to our neurological system and liver. The oils do not contain the chemicals that cause neurological damage to the body. Ayurveda Ayurveda was created by the Vedic civilization of India. The system brings together the use of the earth, water, air, fire and space. The body needs the proper balance to sustain a health life. With the use of energy work for healing, eating the proper foods for the body type and meditation for spiritual balance, a person can have a healthier balance in all areas of their life. Biofield Medicine Biofield Medicine is working with the energy fields around the body to help promote healing on all levels. Working with the energies within the body and around the body, one can heal faster after surgeries and release old energies that we may be still holding onto. Craniosacral therapy, Healing Touch, Therapeutic Touch and Reiki are examples of Biofield Medicine. Blood Analysis Poor health conditions can be revealed through the analysis of dry or live blood samples. These samples can show parasites, toxins and many more imbalances in the human system from hormone imbalance to chronic fatigue. This provides a basis for where to start with the healing process and what the body needs to work on first. Body Talk Body talk is done by taping on the body to access the inner wisdom and memories of the body to balance the system and prevent poor health issues from reoccurring. Body talk is used to heal the energy circuits within the body along with releasing old habits and fears that we hold onto. Body Work Body work can be performed by the use of different healing techniques such as massage therapy, acupressure, chiropractic, Rolfing, physical therapy and energy work. The result is the balancing of the physical and emotional state of being, working with the structure of the body and releasing blocks. Brain Gym Brain Gym is the use of educational kinesiology. This form of healing helps to redevelop the brains neural pathways through physical movement in order to reprogram and improve our concentration, reading, memory, listening and confidence. Chakra Balancing Our bodies have seven major chakras or energy centres: root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye and crown chakra. When these chakras become blocked, our physical, emotional and spiritual well-being can be affected in our daily living. Chakra balancing can be achieved through many remedies and techniques. Some of the methods we can use are aromatherapy, crystals, colour therapy, massage, meditation, prayer, sound and music therapy, reflexology, Reiki, tuning forks, yoga and visualization. Chiropractor Chiropractors work mainly with the spine, making adjustments to the skeletal system. These adjustments can release pinched nerves, headaches, unbalanced hips and many more ailments that can affect the health and mobility of the client. Chiropractors are one of the first alternative methods of healing that was accepted in the Western countries. Clearings for Home and Business Smudging is done with sage to clear rooms/buildings of negative or old energy. Smudging can also release emotional imprints that have been left behind from unpleasant situations and events. Smudging can be used to help release entities or spirits from areas that they are occupying. Tools for clearing are energy work, sage, smudge wand sweetgrass, Coaching Coaching can be provided and applied to many different areas of our lives. A motivational coach helps the client to recognize how one is allowing misguided believes or practices to get in the way of going forward and reaching new goals. Counselling Similar to the coach, this is a person who can empathize and mirror another person's experiences in order to help the client to resolve the problem or issue at hand. Counselling helps to provide the support that a person needs to go forward in their life. Craniosacral Therapy Craniosacral therapy was developed by John Upledger. He discovered a gentle form of healing, working with the pulse of the cranial system to release blocks that have occurred from physical and emotional stress and trauma. Craniosacral therapy is administered through monitoring the rhythm of the cerebrospinal fluid's flow through the system. The movable skull, sacrum and coccyx are attached to membranes, encompassing the cerebrospinal fluid. Experienced clinicians can detect motion or blocked areas. Light, hands-on touch assists hydraulic forces to improve the body's internal system, thus strengthening the body's ability to heal itself. By freeing tension from the spinal cord, the cerebral spinal flows more freely. Craniosacral therapy optimizes rhythm of the spinal fluid and influences the whole body. It is relaxing, safe and effective; and Craniosacral therapy may heal or alleviate numerous conditions including migraines, chronic fatigue, motor coordination impairments, stress and tension, TMJ and orthopedic problems. Crystal Healing Each crystal has different healing properties and different vibrational energy. Crystals provide energy healing for the physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Crystals are a wonderful asset and healing tool to have in your home and office. Crystals have been used since the beginning of time in many healing practices. They carry the energies of both heaven and earth. Cupping Cupping is used with the Chinese medicine techniques. Either a bamboo cup or a glass is vacuumed to the body of the client to increase circulation and extract or drain the body of the cold or damp evils (blocks) from the body.

The doula goes through years of training for this work. Dowsing Dowsing is a form of neutralizing and curing energies in your environment that have a negative impact. Dowsing can be done to find electromagnetic frequencies in your home and is also used to find non-beneficial energies. These energies can make a person sick, physically and emotionally until they are removed. Dowsing rods are used to find water and to help clear energies. Ear Candling Use of wax covered cotton to help clear the sinuses, equalizes pressure in the head and boosts the immune system. This can help to decrease candida, enhance the hearing, healing infections, brings relief to the sinus and more. The use of ear candles is illegal in Canada. Entity and Spirit Clearings Often different elemental entities, heavy energies or dark spirits attach themselves to property, humans and animals. They are looking for another source of energy. The universe uses light workers to help release spirits and entities that are stuck to the earth. These energies do not like strong sources of light energy. When the entities are attached to someone, the person may feel sick or get the chills. As the entity or dark spirit is exposed to higher vibrational energies such as Reiki energy or crystal energy, their energy changes, and it is easier to release them for safe processing. Essential Oils Essential oils can be used everyday in your home, office and clinic. Essential oils have different healing properties, from being a disinfectant and antibacterial to being soothing and relaxing. Essential oils are extracted from the plant world to help heal the human body of all ages, pets and farm animals along with being used as cleaning and for disinfecting the living or work area. Feng Shui Using the Chinese art of placement, we can balance and enhance the energy flow in our living and work spaces.

One may use prayer, meals for healing and other natural methods to enhance the well-being of the patient. Guided Imagery Guided imagery is a practice of visualizing better health for the body. This is a method of positive thinking and visualizing a state of healthier well-being to overcome any illness or setbacks that one may be experiencing. An example is if a child had cancer, the child could visualize a Pac-Man character going through his or her body to eat all the cancer cells. This imagery can help the person stay in a positive state, and it can slow down the cancer growth. Healing Touch Healing touch is a therapeutic treatment that assists people by restoration of balance in the human energy field. A complimentary medicine, healing touch helps decrease pain, increase effectiveness of conventional medicine, relieves anxiety and helps promote the self-healing processes. This is done by placement of the hands 1 - 6 inches above the body surface. Health Care Products We are looking for products that are environmentally safe and beneficial that do not have any harmful chemicals. Many of the products in the market place have ingredients that are toxic externally and internally. From bath soaps to toothpaste, from air fresheners to cleansers, they are brands names that people have used for years, and the toxicity tests are finally being released. Health Foods These are organic foods that enhance our health through using more due care with the growth and production for the ingredients that are added to the final product. For many of us, store shelf foods and additives are no longer acceptable in our daily lives. Many people require specific diets and ingredients to ensure good health. For example, many people have reactions physically and mentally when they consume gluten found in different forms of flour. Young children can have huge emotional swings from the yellow and red food dyes that are used in canned goods and juices. We now have a larger selection of food products that are better for our body types and requirements.
