This search was augmented by a manual search of the references of the key articles and the related literature.Findings: Placebo and nocebo effects are psychobio- logical events imputable to the therapeutic context. Placebo is de ned as an inert substance that provokes perceived bene ts, whereas the term nocebo is used when an inert substance causes perceived harm. Their majormechanisms are expectancy and classical conditioning.Placebo is used in several elds of medicine, as a diagnostic tool or to reduce drug dosage. Placebo/noceboeffects are dif cult to disentangle from the natural course of illness or the actual effects of a new drug in a clinical trial. There are known strategies to enhance clinical results by manipulating expectations and conditioning.

INTRODUCTION The placebo effect has been studied extensively through-out history. 1,2The nocebo effect, also called \"the evil brother of the placebo effect, \"has been less studied, but in recent years has become a subject of growinginterest. 3-5Both phenomena are composed of several intertwined biological and environmental mechanisms, displaying a complex interaction. Their operative mech-anisms not only are affected by the characteristics of the individuals but also on the context in which they operate; thus, the search for a simple equation to predict the effectof placebo and nocebo has been met with limited success. A precise de nition of the placebo and nocebo pheno- mena is dif cult to pinpoint, as different researchers have used different de nitions, often depending on the context. As t a r t i n gd e nition would be psychobiological events attributable to the overall therapeutic context 6; herein, placebo effect would be the bene ts provoked by an inert substance, and the nocebo effect is the induction of true or perceived harm after treatment with an inactive sub- stance. Thus, a response to treatment, not attributable tothe known mechanism of action of the treatment, is the core feature of both phenomena. This means that the denition can also be applied to an active substance treatment, then referring to the (extra) effects it elicits andthat are not explained by its pharmacologic action. Many disorders have a natural course of illness in which symptoms fluctuate, making it dif cult to differentiate between a placebo or nocebo response and the natural course of illness at an individual patient level. Similarly, many \"side effects \"occur commonly with or without pharmacotherapies (eg, headache), making it often difcult to disentangle, at an individual patient level, between a treatment-emergent adverse event that is anocebo response or one that has occurred independently of treatment. Paradigmatically, the placebo and nocebo phenomena have been most extensively studied in analgesia 7-10and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).11These phenomena have been studied more recently in the eld of dermato- logy12-14and in psychiatry, particularly in depression.15 The underpinnings of placebo and nocebo are psycho- logical and neurobiological. Psychological mechanismsinclude expectancies, conditioning, learning, mem- ory, motivation, somatic focu s, reward, anxiety reduction and meaning, and \"placebo-by-proxy by clini- cians and family members.16Two principal mecha- are well supported. The rst aspect involves expec- tancy: the administration of placebo creates expectations in future responses by using simple verbal cues as modu-lators of expectations. Researchers can nudge a subject'sexpectations and boost the placebo effect. The second aspect involves classical conditioning: repeated associa- tions between a neutral stimulus and an unconditionedstimulus (active drug) can result in the ability of the neu- tral stimulus by itself to provoke a response characteristic of the unconditioned stimulus. 4,17,18In a study of placebo/ nocebo in thermal pain, neith er conditioning nor expect- ation alone seemed to be able to elicit placebo or nocebo effects; however, the combination of experience (con-ditioning) and expectation resulted in signi cant placebo (analgesia) or nocebo (hyperalgesia) effects. 19 Misattribution is the inappropriate attribution of improvement or worsening to a treatment when it wasactually caused by the disorder 's natural fluctuation of symptoms or other causes. 20Misattribution may have a more signi cant role in nocebo effects than in placebo effects, although this theory remains a focus of active debate.21,22 The neurobiology of the response to placebo and nocebo has been studied mostly in the paradigmatic eld of analgesia and has been shown to be mainly related to the opioid and dopaminergic pathways.6,23,24 A companion paper published in this issue of Clinical Therapeutics reviews the theoretical and biological underpinnings of the nocebo and placebo phenomena.25 It is important to note that placebo and nocebo responses are highly variable across individuals. Some individual differences have been associated with genetic polymorphisms or underlying neurologic impairments.For example, patients with frontal lobe impairment, especially prefrontal lobe, have decreased expectancy and learning, and thus they partially or totally lose theirplacebo response. In a study of Alzheimer's disease and pain, patients with reduced Frontal Assessment Battery scores exhibited a reduced placebo component of theanalgesic treatment. 26In intellectually disabled patients, a higher intelligence quotient was positively related with placebo response.27 Catechol-O-methyl transferase is involved in dopa- Number 3is a G to A mutation leading to amino acid substitution at codon 158 in the transmembrane form of the enzyme.28It was suggested as a biomarker of placebo response in IBS and a potential biomarker of placeboresponse in other conditions. 11Thus, people who carry this polymorphism are mor e likely to experience the placebo effect. The tryptophan hydroxylase-2 polymorphism (seroto- nin-related gene) seems a signi cant predictor of clinical placebo response in social anxiety disorder. Homozygos- ity for the G allele was associated with serotonergicmodulation of amygdala activity and greater improve- ment in symptoms of anxiety. 29People who experience anxiety disorder and carry t his polymorphism are more likely to experience the placebo effect. Thus, psycho- logical and neurobiological factors can predict individual differences in placebo and nocebo response. The present review rst focuses on the impact of placebo and nocebo effects in routine clinical settings as well as in clinical trials, and then offers strategies on how to use that knowledge to improve the qualityof care and results in research. MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature search of PubMed was conducted forarticles published between January 1980 and Septem- ber 2016. Search terms included: placebo, nocebo, clinical, clinical trial, clinical setting, placebo effect,nocebo effect, adverse effects, and treatment out- comes . This search was augmented by a manual search of the references of the key articles and therelated literature. Systematic reviews, randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case series were identi ed. Articles that had an emphasis on placebo or nocebo effects in clinicalpractice were selected for the qualitative synthesis. CLINICAL APPLICATION The clinical understanding of the placebo effect is arelevant issue. Placebo responses may be a major driver of clinical change after diverse therapies. Placebos are used in several elds of medicine (eg, neurology, psychiatry, rheumatology, pain management, ophthal-mology), although ethical considerations limit their use in some areas. When surveyed, 45% of American physicians admitted to having used a placebo. 30An English study found that only 12% of general prac- titioners use pure placebos (totally inert interventions)but the number was 97% for impure ones (interventions with clear ef cacy for certain conditions but are prescribed for conditions in which their ef cacy is unknown).31The most common reason to use a placebo was to tranquilize the patient (18%) and as a supplemental treatment (18%). Other reasons included \"after 'unjusti nonspeci c complaints all clinically indicated possibilities were exhausted \"(11%), \"to control pain \"(6%), \"to get the patient to stop complaining \"(6%), and \"as a diagnostic tool \"(4%).30It has been argued that the clinical bene ts from many poorly evidence based complementary and alternative disciplines derivelargely or even solely from cultivation of the factors that drive placebo effects. 32Local regulations, however, preclude clinical use of placebos in some jurisdictions. Patients need a greater dose of analgesic to achieve an equivalent outcome if their p lacebo response is impaired. When patients with postoperative pain were given intra- venous saline (placebo), and buprenorphine was madeavailable on request, the gro up told that the intravenous saline was a powerful painkiller took 33% less analgesia for the same pain compared with a control group (whowere told they were receivin g a rehydrating solution). 33 CHALLENGES IN CLINICAL TRIALS The placebo or nocebo response is related to common biochemical pathways that ar e activated both by social stimuli and therapeutic rituals on one hand and by drugson the other. It has been shown that when an opioid agent is administered, it binds to -opioid receptors, but the very same -opioid receptors are activated by the patient 's expectations about the drug. 34This outcome is concordant with the nding that drugs without thera- peutic rituals are less effective.35A suitable therapeutic setting can thus enhance the placebo response.36 The placebo effect has been well established in RCTs. In depression, its magnitude has been shown tovary depending on the investigators. Some propose that up to 75% of the drug effect is mediated by the placebo effect. 37,38Others question these results, arguing that an unrepresentative subset of clinicaltrials (including many cases of mild to moderate depression) were analyzed, and therefore the data are not accurate. 39,40This theory suggests that pa- tients with less severe depression have a lower bio- logical substrate and are more vulnerable to theV. Chavarria et al. March 2017 479placebo effect. In 2002,41a meta-analysis was con- ducted with US Food and Drug Administration data containing RCTs that had not been published. This study revealed a small signi cant difference between antidepressant drug and placebo but not a clinical difference; the mean difference between drug and placebo was /C242 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. An alternative hypothesis to explain thisdifference in antidepressant trials is \"breached blind. \" Because of the side effects of the drugs, the RCT patients may know if they are in the placebo or theactive group. 42Furthermore, when another active antidepressant is used as the comparator, instead of placebo, there is a signi cant increase in the effectiveness of the drug.43 It remains controversial whether the placebo effect is increasing across time in RCTs of depression. It hasbeen proposed that the placebo effect has progres-sively increased over time 44within the general population as a result of in flation of baseline severity to meet threshold inclusion criteria; that is,trials with less ill people, in which regression to the mean is more likely, and more comprehensive and frequent assessment procedures. Others have arguedthat pharmaceutical companies try to select only severely depressed patients because pharmacotherapy RCTs for mild and moderate depression often do notshow statistically signi cant separation between the treatment and placebo trial arms, 45thus downplaying the role of decreased baseline depression severity as anexplanation. In contrast, a recent meta-analysis usingpublished and unpublished data found stable placebo responses in the last 25 years, 46implying the increase across time effect may be an artifact. PLACEBO/NOCEBO AND SEPARATION FROM THE NATURAL COURSE OF ILLNESS Understanding the natural course of illness is essential before commencing a clinical trial design or trying toseparate drug from placebo effects. Given the fact that symptom severity does not stay frozen in time when no intervention is applied, the spontaneous progressor improvement of a pathological process can obvi-ously confound or pose as a placebo or nocebo effect. These types of studies present numerous challenges, especially as modern medicine shifts its attention frominfectious disorders to chronic or mental disorders (which wax and wane, where the natural history ofillness extends greatly in time or has poor or no biomarkers available). 47 Prospective nonintervention studies are increasingly ethically challenging as fewer diseases are lackingeffective treatment. Therefore, in many cases, it is impossible to include a nontreatment arm in a clinical trial to guide our interpretation of results and discountthe in fluence of natural progression. A loophole to this problem was found in studies of psychotherapy efcacy on major depressive disorder that use a wait-list as a control group. A meta-analysis 48found that \"wait-listers \"experience /C2433% of the symptomatic improvement of treated patients and 40% of the ones receiving placebo. An importantcaveat is that a wait-list is thus a very poor control group for clinical trials, despite being used often. Some studies even found that wait-list results innocebo effects. 49 STRATEGIES (USING PLACEBO TO IMPROVE RESULTS) Maximizing Placebo Patient expectations contribute toward the out- come of several disorders. This has been demonstrated for analgesia, treatment of myocardial infarction and Parkinson 's disease, deep brain stimulation, orthope- dic surgery, and antidepressant treatment.22Positively influencing patients 'beliefs about therapeutic success is one way to maximize the placebo effect.50However, being too optimistic is also ethically problematic andcan be construed as disingenuous if one is not cautious. Manipulating a patient 's expectations may not necessarily require lying or deceiving. In a study ofIBS, patients were informed they were being treated with placebo and still developed a positive clinical response. 51 A partial reinforcement paradigm, placebo-con- trolled drug reduction (PCDR) (use of a full dose of medication for a set period of time [acquisition period]followed by a maintenance or evocation period with interposed placebo) has been shown to lower the dose needed to elicit a therapeutic response. This nding opens the door for a panoply of chronic disorderstreated with medications with substantial side effects (Table I ). PCDR allowed children with attention- decit/hyperactivity disorder to be effectively treated with 50% of their optimal stimulant dose 52and reduced the corticosteroid dose needed in psoriasis.53Clinical Therapeutics 480 Volume 39 Number 3It is usually assumed that more complex, time- consuming, and invasive interventions are more likelyto be associated with placebo effects than other interventions. For instance, different colors and sizes of a pill seem to in fluence the clinical outcome. 54 However, to our knowledge, only 1 systematic review55has found mixed evidence of more invasive placebos having larger effects (7 of 12 studies with41 placebo found no difference, 4 found single- outcome differences, and 1 found a large effect; 2 of 4 studies designed to differentiate placebo intensity were positive). The extant data may not be suf cient to discount its in fluence. To design studies directly comparing very different placebo interventions (ie, pill vs injection) while ensuring blinding for both patientsand researchers ranges from very dif cult to impos- sible. Also, to try to design studies controlling for context or for patient or clinician bias in expectanciesmight be a Sisyphean-like task, as the differences incontext and expectancies themselves may be the cause of the placebo effect. Although the placebo could be more powerful, deliberately administering a more invasive or intense placebo may be both ethically challenging (especially one with potential to cause harm) and lacking inevidence. Conversely, a meta-analysis of 41 RCTs assessing the effects of antidepressant agents on majordepressive disorder showed that the more follow-up observations that occur, the more intense are the placebo effects elicited. 56The number of medical visits in clinical trials contrasts with the shorter contact in community settings. This strategy is well established and can be useful because it is nonharmful.Proling or choosing the right person to try a placebo might be more problematic. There was limited evide- nce for the role of age or sex, at least in psychiatric disorders. 57A stronger correlation was found for low symptom severity and short duration of illness. There were 2 studies in children reporting a higher placebo effect in those of non-white ethnic origin.58,59 Managing Placebo in Clinical Trials When comparing a drug versus a placebo, the rst thing to bear in mind is that the effect of an activedrug includes in itself a placebo component. Further-more, issues are further complicated because the relation of the effects between the placebo and drug groups may not always be additive; that is, themeasured effect in the active drug arm may be more (or less) than expected just by adding the placeboTable I. Strategies to maximize the placebo effect. Managing Expectations Conditioning Screen for patients with negative beliefs Placebo-controlled drug reduction (PCDR) Hidden applications when discontinuing a drug expected to cause withdrawal symptomsUse salient stimuli and constant context when administering treatment including sensorial cues, same room and time of day when giving treatment Promote social contact with other successful patientsUse effective pretreatments Reduce anxiety Avoid extinction in long-term treatments Motivation strategies, changes in situational cuesEnhance physician -patient relationship Empathic style, more time of contact Describe the procedure before executing to improve attention Adapted from Enck et al.22V. Chavarria et al. March 2017 481effect to the actual active drug effect.22,60Therefore, perhaps \"optimizing the drug -placebo difference \"(vs minimizing placebo) is a preferable denomination. Designing clinical trials is a specialized eld in its own right. Separating a drug effect from a placebo effect always at the core of a clinical trial design, sothat general quality guidelines for a clinical trial usually will work to optimize the drug -placebo differ- ence: standardizing for symptom severity; avoidingphysician 's selection bias; controlling for center effects and patient adherence; and ensuring effective blinding. However, sometimes these strategies are accompanied by other undesirable effects. For example, if we identifydrug responders during a run-in phase or preselect patients who were previously exposed to a similar drug, we may increase the drug -placebo difference, but we also risk limiting a drug indication and overestimating bene- ts. If the population of previous responders comprised a specicg r o u p( e g ,w o m e n ) ,t h et r i a lw i l ln e v e rg e n e r a t e approval for men. Some strategies involve deceit and thus have ethical concerns. Cost and feasibility are concerns as well (eg, when considering augmenting sample size).Therefore, it is up to the researcher to weigh the risks and bene ts of each strategy. Because the chance of being in a treatment group increases the magnitude of placebo responses, 61as t u d y design of equal likelihood of receiving placebo or treatment (ie, avoid enrichment or multidosing studies) should be preferred. Contrary to common belief, tryingto exclude placebo responders using run-in phases early in the study was not able to prevent later placebo response.62Randomized run-in (ie, in a double-blind manner, patients rst start receiving placebo and are then switched to the active drug after a few days) and withdrawal periods seem to hold more promise.63 Crossover designs may promote conditioning64and may lead to unblinding of the study due to perceivedside effects. Using active placebos (drugs that mimic the active treatment side effects) is a possible perfect placebo that rarely exists, mimicking all the side effects withoutany of the active mechanisms of the drug being tested. Controlling for the natural progression of the disease should also be a concern, even if in many situations it isethically challenging and may motivate subjects to drop out. A way around this is using Zelen 'sd e s i g n , 65 in which patients are randomly divided into an observational group and an interventional groupcomprising the active drug and placebo branches, allowing to control for the natural course of illness. Comparative effectiveness trials are usually used when an ef cacious treatment already exists for ethical standards. The new drug must then prove superiority, equivalence, or noninferiority. However, it has beenshown that a drug tested against an active comparator performs better. 61,66The placebo effect is also report- edly stronger when patients report the outcome thanwhen the physician performs the assessment, 67which is itself stronger than a biomarker-based evaluation.68 The most objective outcome possible is death or survival rate, but this approach obviously cannot beused for many disorder endpoints ( Table II ). Minimizing Nocebo In the case of nocebo, no overt ethical dilemma is present. The intention of the physician is always to minimize its risk and effects. Also, we can expect thefactors and strategies used to minimize the nocebo effect to be a mirror of the ones in placebo. Of major importance would be to identify indi- viduals more prone to develop nocebo effects. Several studies have be en conducted to identify \"risk factors \"of the nocebo effect. A systematic review 4 found \"learning/social observation, \"\"perceived dose, \" \"verbal suggestions of arousal and symptoms, \"and \"baseline symptom expectations \"to be the strongest predictors of nocebo effects. Interestingly, the type ofadministration again did not appear to be relevant, nor did self-awareness during exposure. Symptom severity atTable II.

Death2. Biomarkers 3. Physician assessment 4. Patient-reported outcomesClinical Volume 39 Number 3baseline (one of the stronges t associations with placebo) also produced mixed results. Demographic factors suchas sex, age, and literacy did not change the risk of a nocebo response. One study found that female inves- tigator subjects report noceb o effects twice as frequently as male subjects after a social suggestion paradigm, but these data could have been confounded by the study design (the social cue was presented by a female ). 69 In modern health systems in which access is good, participants who volunteer for trials may have presented with poor response or have not toleratedstandard therapy. This earlier adverse experienceincreases the likelihood of these subjects being primed for nocebo responses. 70 Managing patients 'beliefs and experiences are at the core of possible strategies. Framing of informa- tion is an effective way to put the bene ts and risks of treatment in perspective, focusing on the positivepossibilities. 71A caring and empathic relationship is benecial.72When the medical problem allows for a small delay in the start of therapy, a lower initialdose might be helpful. Similarly, in RCTs, if a patientdoes not know when exactly he or she is getting exposed, nocebo effects are reduced ( Table III ). Nevertheless, this approach may be rarely feasiblein outpatient settings or even time- and resource- consuming in a hospital setting.CONCLUSIONS Clinically, placebo and nocebo effects are of majorimportance, being present in daily medical practice. The overall effect of a drug stems from its pharmaco-dynamic actions plus the psychological effect derived from the act of its administration. Although both placebo and nocebo have been widely studied, the fullcomplexity of their mechanisms needs further de ni- tion. Thus, when correctly applied, there are a number of strategies that can improve responses and patients ' quality of life, maximizing placebo and reducingnocebo in clinical practice, and enhancing results in clinical trials. It underlines the impact of creating a good physician -patient relationship, increasing em- pathic attitudes, exposing information suitably, decreasing expectations of adverse effects, and pro- moting social contact between successfully treatedpatients.

T his is in contr ast to positive e xpectancies tha t trig ger pla- cebo e ffects (1). In evolutionar y terms, nocebo and placebo e ffects coe xist to favor perceptual mechanisms tha t anticipa te threa t and dang erous e vents (nocebo e ffects) and promote appe titive and safe viors (placebo e ffects). I n randomized placebo- controlled clinical trials, pa tients tha t re- ceive placebos of ten repor t side e ffects (nocebos) tha t are similar to those e xpe- rienced by pa tients tha t receive the in vestigational treatment ( 2). I nforma- tion provided during the informed consent process and divulg ence of adverse effects contribute to nocebo effects in clinical trials ( 1). Nocebo (and placebo) e f- fects engag e a comple x set of neur al circ uits in the centr al ner vous sys tem tha t modula te the perception of touch, pressure, pain, and temper ature ( 1, 3, 4). Commercial features of drugs such as price and labeling influence placebos ( 5, 6). On pag e 105 of this issue, Tinnermann et al. (7) show tha t price also influences nocebo e ffects. Tinnermann et al. evaluated the responses of health y par ticipants who received t wo pla- cebo creams labeled with t wo dis tinct prices and presented in t wo bo xes tha t had mar- keting char acteristics of e xpensive or cheap medica tion. T he creams were described as produc ts tha t relie ve itch but induce local pain sensitiza tion (h yperalgesia). All creams, including controls, were identical and con- tained no ac tive ingredients. N ocebo h y- peralgesic e ffects were larg er for the \"more expensive \" cream than for the \" cheaper \" cream. Combined cor ticospinal imaging revealed tha t the e xpensive price v alue in- creased ac tivity in the pre frontal cor tex. Furthermore, br ain regions such as the ros- tral anterior cingula te cor tex (rA CC) and the periaqueduc tal gr ay (PAG) encoded the dif-ferential nocebo e ffects be trea side e ffects associa ted with the e xpensive cream ma y have trig gered a facilita tion of nociception processes a t early subcor tical areas and the spinal cord [which are also volved in placebo-induced reduc- tion deac- tivation and fa vored a subsequent ac tivation of the P AG and spinal cord, resulting in an increase of the nociceptive inputs. T his sug- gests tha t the rA CC-P AG-spinal cord axis may orches trate the e ffects pricing on no- cebo yperalgesia. The anticipa tion of painful s timula tion mak es health y study par ticipants perceive nonpainful and low-painful erbally induced nocebo e ffects are as strong as those induced through ac tual e xposure to high pain ( 9). Mo re- over, receiving a placebo after simula ting an e ffec- tive analg esic trea to inter vention af ter a trea tment perceived as ineffective, produces cessful or successful pain f inter ventions and placebo analg esic e ffects is link ed to a higher ac tivation of the bila teral pos terior in- sula and reduced ac tivation of the right dor- solateral pre frontal cor tex (11).

These findings t communica- tion of trea tment discontinua tion might, a t least in par t, lead to nocebo e ffects with ag- gravation of symptoms. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, no- cebo e ffects can influence pa tients' clinical outcomes and trea tment adherence. I t was shown in a clinical trial tha t atorvastatin in- duced in the same individuals an e xcess r ate of muscle-rela ted adverse e vents in the non- blinded (i.e., pa tients kne w the y were taking atorvastatin), nonr andomized 3 -year follow- up phase but not in the initial blinded 5 -year phase when pa tients and ph ysicians were unaware of the informa tion about side e ffects for s tatins via claims has led to trea tment discon- tinua tion and an increase in fa tal strokes and heart attacks ( 14). Given tha t nocebo e ffects contribute to perceived side e ffects and ma y influence clinical outcomes and pa tients' adherence to medica tion, we should consider how to a void them in clinical trials and pr actices ( 15)\u2014for example, by tailoring pa tient-clinician com- munica tion to balance truthful informa tion about adverse e vents with e xpectancies of outcome improvement, e xploring pa tients' treatment belie fs and nega tive ther history, and pa ying a ttention to fr aming (i.e., treatment description) and conte xtual e ffects (i.e., price). T hrough an unders tanding of the physiological mechanisms, s trategies could be de veloped to reduce nocebo e ffects. j REFERENCE S AND NOTES 1. L. Colloca, F. G. Miller, Psychosom.

The mechanism of action of placebos has been investigated by several researchers. This review investigates the currentknowledge regarding the theoretical and biological underpinning of the nocebo and placebo phenomena. Method: Literature was searched using PubMed using the following keywords: nocebo, placebo, - opioid, dopamine, conditioning, and expectancy .R e l - evant papers were selected for review by the authors. Findings: The roles of conditioning and expectancy, and characteristics associated with nocebo and placebo responses, are discussed. These factors affect nocebo andplacebo responses, although t heir effect sizes vary greatly, depending on inter-individual differences and different experimental paradigms. The neurobiology of the nocebo and placebo phenomena is also reviewed, emphasizingthe involvement of reward pathways, such as the -opioid and dopamine pathways. Neurobiological pathways havebeen investigated in a limited range of experimentalparadigms, with the greatest efforts on experimentalmodels of placebo analgesia. The interconnectedness ofpsychological and physiological drivers of nocebo andplacebo responses is a core feature of these phenomena. Implications: Further research is needed to fully understand the underpinnings of the nocebo andplacebo phenomena. Neurobiology pathways need tobe investigated in experimental paradigms that model the placebo response to a broader range of pathologies. Similarly, although many psychological factors andinter-individual characteristics have been identi ed as signicant mediators and moderators of nocebo and placebo responses, the factors identi ed to date are unlikely to be exhaustive.

Nocebo and placebo responses are also sometimes used to describe unexpected responses to active treatments that are not explained bythe known mechanism of actio n of the treatment. It may not be possible to discern at an individual participant level between true placebo or nocebo responses and fluctua- tions in symptom severity du e to the natural progression of the illness; however, in sightful placebo and nocebo response data can often be obtained at a cohort level. While the importance of the placebo effect is widelyunderstood, this is much less so for the nocebo effect. The biological bases of the nocebo and placebo effects are only now beginning to be unraveled. Attempts to understandthe causes of the placebo effect have increased in the last 50 years, as placebo-controlle d clinical trials have become the only accepted method for ef cacy testing of new pharmaceuticals and the problems associated with place-bos have become more apparent. Insights have been gained from exploring theoretical causes and in fluencing factors of the effect, which have probed the mechanismsunderlying the phenomenon. This article reviews the theoretical and biological underpinning of the nocebo and placebo phenomena. A separate article also publishedin this issue reviews the clinical importance of the nocebo and placebo phenomena. PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS There are a multitude of psychological elements that have been identi ed as the leading factors under- pinning the placebo and nocebo effects. The most well-known theories pertaining to the placebo and nocebo phenomena are the conditioningand expectancy hypotheses . Conditioning can occur when a person was pre-exposed to an active substance and had a reaction that imprints in memory. When theyare then given an inert substance, they might respond to the inert substance in the same or similar way as they would to the active substance. A conditioned response isa triggering of a memory loop and, therefore, is driven by learning and adaptation. 1The effect is mediated by many variables. The conditioning hypothesis alone isinsufcient to explain the placebo and nocebo pheno- mena, for example, the extinction phenomenon in classic conditioning does not nece ssarily occur with placebos. 1 Expectancy occurs where a pre-existing belief, or information received before being given an inert sub- stance (or before reporting a response2), elicits a responseto the inert substance predicated on what the person thinks will happen. It is not necessary to have ever been exposed to an active substance to have an expectation of response. This may be responding to a treatment that isnot pharmacologically active because of a pre-existing belief that the treatment either works or might cause a specic reaction, and can be an important factor in alternative therapies in which pharmacologically activecompounds are not included in the treatment. 3Similarly, expectation can be a driver of inappropriate or over- prescription of some medications, including antibiotics,i nap h e n o m e n o nt h a ts h a r e sm u c hi nc o m m o nw i t ht h e placebo effect. 4As with conditioning, expectancy also requires learning, which may come through direct receiptof information, suggestion, social cues, or the interaction of all these learning modalities. 5Suggestion has also been used experimentally to extinguish a conditioned placeboresponse. 6Extinction of a conditioned response requires learning, which in the case of a placebo response can be facilitated by suggestion, bu t may not necessarily occur solely through repeated administration of a placebo. Hope for improvement has also been suggested as a driver of the placebo effect1and this has face validity; however, data have not been presented to support thistheory. A corollary, where despair is suggested to drive the nocebo effect, has not been proposed in peer- reviewed literature. However, personality traits have beenassociated with placebo response, 7leaving the possibility open to an association between p ersonality traits, such as optimism and pessimism, being factors in the placeboand nocebo phenomena. However, considerable workneeds to be done to unravel t he relationship between personality and placebo response, including expanding the theoretic underpinnings of the association throughhypothesis-driven research in addition to the current works that have focused on as sociation between person- ality measures and placebo response. 8State and trait variance are a limitation w ith personality measures9and may be relevant for the place bo response, for example, where there is variance in dependence. The nature of the therapeutic alliance may also be a driver of the nocebo effect, with a hostile /C0dependent relationship being an exemplar. This relationshippattern occurs when one party is dependent on an-other, and the former is hostile or mistrusting of other people. This is a not uncommon but poorly recognized pattern in clinical practice, where people with insecureattachment styles are forced into trusting a clinician, and their interactional style makes this dif cultFigure .Clinical Therapeutics 470 Volume 39 Number 3In an open-labeled study, 80 women with irritable bowel syndrome were randomly assigned to placebowith a persuasive rationa le but without deception, or to a control group with no treatment. Both groups received t h es a m ep a t i e n t /C0provider relationship and contact time. Participants in the placeb o - t r e a t e dg r o u ph a ds i g n i - cantly higher global improvement scores. 10In this study, the placebo effect occurred even though the participants were told they would be re ceiving an inert substance \"like sugar pills. \"This may suggest that the placebo effect has multiple drivers, including expectancy, as participants were told that placebo \"has been shown to produce signi cant improvement to [irritable bowel syndrome] symptoms, \"as well as the importance of the treatment rituals and therapeutic environment. There is evidence that anxiety about the tolerability or efcacy of a treatment can be a driver of the nocebo effect. In a meta-analysis of placebo-treated participants in clinical trials of duloxetine versus placebo, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported more commonlyin Phase II trials, then Phase III, and least in Phase IV. 11 This suggests that a nocebo response is more likely for a treatment that is more experimental and uncertaincompared with one that is more established. Choice of treatment and sense of control was found to influence both placebo and nocebo responses in an experiment where healthy participants (n \u00bc61) were randomly assigned to choose between 2 equivalent -blocker medications or be assigned to the medications. All study medications were actually placebos. There was an increased placebo response in the choice group and an increased nocebo response in the no-choice group. 12 Neurobiological Findings Numerous experiments have revealed insights into which regions of the brain are involved in the placebo response and which biochemical processes are occur- ring in association with placebo and nocebo events.Imaging studies have often used a placebo analgesia paradigm, as it is a reliable and B-Nocebo A-PlaceboPAGAmyNaloxone NAcc NAccCCK implicated in placebo and nocebo.

Placebos to replace psychotropic drugs are also a reliable and convenient paradigm, and a placebo antidepressant has been used for at least one imagingstudy. The placebo and nocebo phenomenon has been found in numerous medical conditions, across drug classes, and in non-pharmacologic contexts. It may bedifcult to disentangle if a neurobiological response is applicable to the placebo and nocebo phenomena in general or only to a speci c context or as treatment for a speci c stimulus. The Figure summarizes brain regions, circuits, and neurotransmitters implicated in placebo and nocebo phenomena. Neuroanatomic Regions Studies using functional nuclear magnetic imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) haveidenti ed multiple brain regions involved in the placebo response. Several studies and a meta-analysis have identi ed the thalamus, cortex as brain regions; these were less activated when measured by fMRI, when placeboanalgesia was used to modulate a response to a pain stimulus. 5PET studies of placebo analgesia have receptor radio- tracers, and the basal ganglia using D2 and D3receptor radiotracers as brain regions with neuro-transmitter response to placebo analgesia. 13 In a deceptive placebo analgesia paradigm fMRI study for visceral pain where participants are random-ized to receive placebo and being told the substance is inert or placebo and being told that the substance is an analgesic, greater modulation by placebo analgesia ofthe posterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was women compared with men, although the ef cacy of placebo analgesia in controlling expected or perceived pain did not differ between sexes. 14A deceptive placebo analgesia paradigm fMRI study for noxious heat pain, where placebos were labeled as apopular branded original or a generic analgesic,original branded and generic labeled placebos were both associated with activation of the anterior insulae at baseline and activation of the dorsomedial prefrontalcortex after the interventions. Greater activation of the bilateral dorsolateral (as well as dorsomedial)prefrontal cortex (PFC) was observed for the placebo labeled as the original brand. The placebo labeled as the original brand was also associated with decreased pain intensity compared with the generic-labeled placebo. 15 A recent PET study using a -opioid receptor radio- tracer, patients with major depressive disorder were treated with placebo in a crossover study in which oneplacebo was labeled \"active \"and the other \"inactive, \" and told that the active treatment was a fast-acting antidepressant and the inactive treatment was a control. Active treatment was superior to inactive treatment forplacebo-induced opioid release in brain to the rostral ACC, the dorsolateral PFC, the insular cortex, and the nucleus accumbens,has observed in an analgesia paradigm usingPET. 17Substantial inter-individual variation has been reported for brain regions involved in placebo response to expectations of analgesia.18 An fMRI study of 24 healthy adults investigated neural activation in response to stimuli associated with different expectations. In 3 separate sessions (ie, train-ing, conditioning, and scanning sessions) on different days, participants were subject to 12-second heat pain stimulus to their right forearm. At the conditioning andtraining sessions, participants skin was treated with an inert cream before the heat pain stimulus. One cream was labeled \"lidocaine \"(positive expectancy), one was labeled \"neutral, \"and the third cream was labeled \"capsaicin \"(negative expectancy). Difference between positive and negative expectancy conditions were ob- served, either pre or post stimulus, in the dorsal operculum 19 This experiment found that placebo and nocebo expectancies have effects on different brain networks in response to a pain stimulus. There are limitations to using fMRI and PET to study models of the nocebo and pla cebo effects. Firstly, most experiments are conducte d on health volunteers, so important drivers of the placebo response, such as hopeand therapeutic alliance, are not included in the exper- imental construct. Secondly, st udy participants are inside a large piece of medical equipment, which is a speci c experimental environment. Thirdly, the experimental environment limits the study design and duration.Clinical Therapeutics 472 Volume 39 Number 3Neurochemical Processes The placebo response has been associated with the release of endorphins and dopamine, providing a neuro- chemical explanation of the ef cacy of placebo analge- sia.13Early evidence of the elevation of endogenous opioids in placebo analgesia was reported in 1978, when Levine et al20used placebo as an analgesic for dental postoperative pain and reversed the analgesic effects byadministering the opiate antagonist naloxone. Endorphin and dopamine release and opioid and dopamine receptors are widely distributed, but are also clustered in speci c brain regions that correspond with many of the regions identi ed by fMRI studies. There are 3 major types of opioid receptor, -opioid receptor, -opioid receptor, and -opioid receptor, which can be further divided into subtypes, and a fourth nociception or orphanin receptor. 21These receptors are widely distributed through the brain and other organs, butwith differences in expression and distribution. 21Opioid receptors have a range of functions, including pain modulation and their association with analgesia,however, they are also associated with various functions, including mood re gulation, homeostasis, cell proliferation, and neuroprotection. 21 Much placebo neurobiological research has focused on analgesia, often investigating the -opioid receptor. Where major depressive disorder has been investi-gated 16increased -opioid neurotransmission has been observed, similar to observations in analgesia research, which may suggest similarities to, or be aconsequence of, using a similar research method.Inter-individual variation in -opioid neurotransmis- sion has also been observed in a study of 50 healthy controls with and without placebo administration,where psychological trait scores measured with scales for altruism, straightforwardness, and angry hostility accounted for 25% of the variance in placebo analge-sic response and also found that participants scoring above the median in a composite score of all 3 traits had increased -opioid neurotransmission in response to placebo administration. 22 An experiment where hypertonic saline was injected into the masseter muscle of 20 healthy individuals toinduce pain, with or without placebo analgesia,was investigated using PET to examine changes in dopamine and opioid neurotransmission. The study used [C 11]-labeled raclopride 2recep- tors) and carfentanil (selective for -opioid receptors). Participants were asked to rate the ef cacy of theanalgesic and describe adverse events. Effective placebo analgesia was associated with increased dopamine and opioid neurotransmission in multiple brain regions. A nocebo effect was identi ed in 5 participants who reported increased pain intensity during placebo ad- ministration. Nocebo responders showed decreased dopamine and opioid neurotransmission in the samebrain regions where increased neurotransmission wasobserved in placebo responders. 23 In a study where patients reporting mild perioperative pain were given saline solution and were told that thesolution produced an increased pain (nocebo hyperanal- gesia), pain was abolished when proglumide was added to the solution. Proglumide is a cholecystokinin at least in part by cholecystokinin.24 PET studies have found that administration of a placebo to people with Parkinson 's disease can induce dopamine release in the striatum.25Furthermore, in a study of 24 participants with Parkinson 'sd i s e a s e undergoing deep brain stimulation, the ring rate of selected neurons was changed in participants who showed a clinical response to placebo, but not innonresponders or partial responders to placebo. Mean ring frequency decreased in subthalamic and substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons and increased in and anterior ventral lateral thalamus neurons. T h ep l a c e b oe f f e c th a dad u r a t i o no fn om o r et h a n4 5 minutes. Other parts of the brain circuitry were notmeasured. 26Another study found that placebo was enhanced with preconditioning by apomorphine exposure, with the greater number of exposures to apomorphine associated with a greater change inneuronal ring rates. 27 Endocannabinoids have a role in placebo-induced analgesia, as reported in a study analogous to the1978 naloxone experiment that reported on the role of endorphins. 20Placebo was effective as an analgesic against tourniquet pain after preconditioningparticipants to analgesia with either analgesia with but did not reverse placebo analgesia in participants preconditioned with morphine. 28 Prostaglandin levels have also been found to change in response to placebo. In an experiment,S. Dodd et al. March 2017 473placebo was used to treat headache caused by high- altitude (3,500 m) hypobaric hypoxia, after precondi- tioning by treating headache with inhaled oxygen and later giving placebo (sham) oxygen, or by precondi-tioning with aspirin and later giving a placebo tablet. In both scenarios, the placebos were effective for reducing headache pain, but the analgesic effect ofplacebo oxygen was superior to placebo aspirin.Placebo oxygen was found to speci cally reduce salivary prostaglandin E 2, mimicking the therapeutic pathway of oxygen therapy, whereas placebo aspirinhad a more general effect on prostaglandin synthesis, mimicking the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition. 29 Interaction of Psychological and Physiological Factors Placebo and nocebo responses occur within a psycho- logical and physiological context. This context is critical for all aspects of the response, including the neuro-biological elements. The context includes characteristicsof the study or treatment in which the placebo or nocebo effect is observed and characteristics of the study partic- ipant or patient, as well as oth er characteristics, including the environment in which the study or treatment is being conducted. The doctor /C0patient relationship, for example, can include trust, where untrustworthiness has beenassociated with increased amygdala activity, and trust- worthiness can be modulated by oxytocin. 30Trust may be a characteristic not only of the active relationship,but is powerfully in fluenced by personality and developmental factors that set individuals levels of trust. Similarly, hope and hopelessness have been associated with serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, 30showing the potential for variables relevant to placebo having a direct effect on neurotransmitter systems directly implicated in mood. Also relevant to the placeboresponse, admiration and compassion by a participant have been found through fMRI to result in a pattern of activation within the posteromedial cortice. 31Learned helplessness has been found to effect serotonin regulation.32The relationship between pain and stress and anxiety with the hypothalamic /C0pituitary /C0adrenal axis and cortisol is w ell established.33 Negative and positive expectations, which are sug- gested to be major drivers of the placebo and nocebo responses, have been found to induce changes in rewardcircuitry in the nucleus accumbens, and similarly, con- ditioning may induce change s in learning mechanisms. 30DISCUSSION The drivers of the placebo and nocebo phenomena may be a synergy of multiple biological and psychological variables, mediated by a further multitude of contextualand individual variables. T here is clear evidence of physiological factors tha t underpin the phenomena, as well as a contribution by psyc hological factors. This is further complicated by considerable inter-individualdifferences. Although there is c onsistency in the literature in terms of which pathways are implicated in placebo and nocebo responses, neurotr ansmitter activation does not occur with all individuals experiencing the same stimulus. Factors such as c onditioning, expectancy, hope and despair, wanting to plea se the experimenters, treat- ment setting, caring nature of the clinician, and personal beliefs about medications, all play a role. Furthermore, while the placebo and nocebo effect has been observed for treatment for a broad range of medicalconditions, it has only been carefully studied in exper- imental models of a narrow range of conditions, espe- cially pain and analgesia. It is possible, or even likely, thatthe neural pathways involved in a placebo analgesia response are different, or only partly overlapping, from the neural pathways involved in a placebo response for adifferent treatment. The investigation of the biological and theoretical underpinning of the placebo and nocebo phenomena is at an early stage and much additionalresearch is required.

Methods: We selectively searched the PubMed database for articles published up to December 2011 that contained the key words \"nocebo\" or \"nocebo effect.\" Results: By definition, a nocebo effect is the induction of a symptom perceived as negative by sham treatment and/or by the suggestion of negative expec-tations. A nocebo response is a negative symptom induced by the patient's own negative expectations and/or by negative suggestions from clinical staff in the absence of any treatment. The underlying mechanisms include learning by Pavlovian conditioning and reaction to expectations induced by verbal in-formation or suggestion. Nocebo responses may come about through uninten-tional negative suggestion on the part of physicians and nurses. Information about possible complications and negative expectations on the patient's part increases the likelihood of adverse e ffects. Adverse events under treatment with medications sometimes come about by a nocebo effect. Conclusion: Physicians face an ethical dilemma, as they are required not just to inform patients of the potential complications of treatment, but also to mini-mize the likelihood of these complications, i.e., to avoid inducing them through the potential nocebo effect of thorough patient information. Possible ways out of the dilemma include emphasizing the fact that the proposed treatment is usually well tolerated, or else getting the patient's permission to inform less than fully about its possible side effects. Communication training in medical school, residency training, and continuing medical education would be desir-able so that physicians can better exploit the power of words to patients' bene-fit, rather than their detriment.

DOI: powerful tool a doctor pos- sesses, but words, like a two-edged sword, can maim as well as heal.\", Bernard Lown (e1). Doctor-patient communication and the patient's treatment expectations can have considerable conse-quences, both positive and negative, on the outcome of a course of medical therapy. The positive influence of doctor-patient communication, treatment expectations, and sham treatments, termed placebo effect, has been known for many years (e2) and extensively studied (1). The efficacy of placebo has been demonstrated for sub-jective symptoms such as pain and nausea (1). The Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association published a statement on placebo in medi- cine in 2010 (2). Method The opposite of the placebo phenomenon, namely nocebo phenomena, have only recently received wider attention from basic scientists and clinicians. A search of the PubMed database on 5 October 2011 revealed 151 publications on the topic of \"nocebo,\" compared with over 150 000 on \"placebo.\" Stripping away from the latter all articles in which \"only\" placebo-controlled drug trials were reported left around 2200 studies investigating current knowledge of the placebo effect. In comparison, the data on the nocebo effect are sparse. Of the 151 publications, only just over 20% were empirical studies: the rest were letters to the editor, commentaries, editorials, and reviews (Figure). Our intention here is to portray the neurobiological mechanisms of nocebo phenomena. Furthermore, in order to sensitize clinicians to the nocebo phenomena in their daily work we present studies on nocebo phenomena in randomized placebo-controlled trials and in clinical practice (medicinal treatment and sur-gery). Finally, we discuss the ethical problems that arise from nocebo phenomena which may be induced by explanation of the proposed treatment in the course of the patient briefing and describe possible solutions. Definition of nocebo phenomena The term \"nocebo\" was originally coined to give a name to the negative equivalent of placebo phenomena and distinguish between desirable and undesirable effects of placebos (sham medications or other sham in-terventions, for instance simulated surgery). \"Nocebo\" was used to describe an inactive substance or Department of Internal Medicine I, Klinikum Saarbr\u00fccken and Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, M\u00fcnchen: PD Dr. med.

HansenDepartment of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Clinic Tuebingen (UKT): Prof. Dr. nat. 459MEDICINE ineffective procedure that was designed to arouse negative expectations (e.g., giving sham medication while verbally suggesting an increase in symptoms) (3). \"Placebo\" and \"nocebo\" are meanwhile being used in another sense: The effects of every medical treat- ment, for example administration of drugs or psycho-therapy, are divided into specific and non-specific. Spe-cific effects are caused by the characteristic elements of the intervention. The non-specific effects of a treatment are called placebo effects when they are beneficial and nocebo effects when they are harmful. Placebo and nocebo effects are seen as psychobi- ological phenomena that arise from the therapeutic con- text in its entirety, including sham treatments, the pa-tients' treatment expectations and previous experience, verbal and non-verbal communications by the person administering the treatment, and the interaction be-tween that person and the patient (4). The term \"nocebo effect\" covers new or worsening symptoms that occur during sham treatment e.g., in the placebo arm of a clinical trial or as a result of deliberate or unintended suggestion and/or negative expectations. \"Nocebo re-sponse\" is used to mean new and worsening symptoms that are caused only by negative expectations on the part of the patient and/or negative verbal and non- verbal communications on the part of the treating person, without any (sham) treatment (5). Experimental nocebo research Experimental nocebo research aims to answer three central questions:Are nocebo effects caused by the same psycho-logical mechanisms as placebo effects, i.e., by learn-ing (conditioning) and reaction to expectations? Are placebo and nocebo effects based on the same or different neurobiological events? Are the predictors of nocebo effects different from those of placebo effects? Psychological mechanisms The proven mechanisms of the placebo response include learning by Pavlovian conditioning and reac- tion to expectations aroused by verbal information or suggestion (6). Learning experiments with healthy pro-bands have shown that worsening of symptoms of nausea (caused by spinning on a swivel chair) can be conditioned (7). Expectation-induced cutaneous hyper-algesia could be produced experimentally through ver-bal suggestion alone (8). Social learning by observation led to placebo analgesia on the same order as direct experience by conditioning (9). Nocebo responses can also be demonstrated in patients. In an experimental study, 50 patients with chronic back pain were randomly divided into two groups before a leg flexion test: One group was in -formed that the test could lead to a slight increase in pain, while the other group was told that the test had no effect on pain level. The group with negative in- formation reported stronger pain (pain intensity 48.1 [standard deviation (SD) 23.7] versus 30.2 [SD 19.6] on scale) [SD 12.5] versus 59.7 [SD 5.9]) than the group with neutral instruction (10).180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 25 20 15 10 5 0 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Nocebo n = 151Placebo n = 2235FIGURE Number of studies on the placebo effect (olive-green bars, left ordinate) and the nocebo effect (blue diamonds, right ordinate) in PubMed between 1950 and 2011 460 Deutsches \u00c4rzteblatt International | Dtsch ~ -1: I ~ . I J ~ 111111 ~I ti IJ lll ,. l - - I h I ii iiii tt I MEDICINE It can be concluded from these studies that both placebo and nocebo responses can be acquired via all kinds of learning. If such reactions occur in everyday clinical practice, one must assume that they arise from the patient's expectations or previous learning experi-ences (5). Neurobiological correlates A key part in the mediation of the placebo response is played by a number of central chemical messengers. Especially dopamine and endogenous opiates have been demonstrated to be central mediators of placebo analgesia. These two neurobiological substrates have also been shown to play a part in the nocebo response (hyperalgesia): While secretion of dopamine and en - dogenous opioids is increased in placebo analgesia, this reaction is decreased in hyperalgesia (11). Because worsening of symptoms e.g., increased sensitivity to pain is often associated with anxiety, other central pro-cesses play a part, e.g., the neurohormone cholecystoki-nin (CCK) in pain (12). To date, a genetic predisposi-tion to placebo response has been demonstrated only for depression and social anxiety (e3); such a predis- position to nocebo response has so far not been shown (e4). Interindividual variation Sex is a proven predictor of the placebo response and also exerts some influence on the nocebo response. In the above-mentioned study on the aggravation of symp-toms of nausea, women were more susceptible to con- ditioning and men to generated expectations (6). Identification of predictors of nocebo responses is a central goal of ongoing investigations. The aim is to pinpoint groups at risk of nocebo responses, for example patients with high levels of anxiety, and opti-mize the therapeutic context accordingly (13). Generation of nocebo responses by doctor- patient and nurse-patient communication The verbal and non-verbal communications of phy -sicians and nursing staff contain numerous uninten-tional negative suggestions that may trigger a nocebo response (14). Patients are highly receptive to negative suggestion, particularly in situations perceived as existentially threatening, such as impending surgery, acute severe illness, or an accident. Persons in extreme situations are often in a natural trance state and thus highly sugges -tible (15, 16). This state of consciousness leaves those affected vulnerable to misunderstandings arising from literal interpretations, ambiguities, and negative sug-gestion (Box) . In medical practice the assumption is that the patient's pain and anxiety are minimized when a pain- ful manipulation is announced in advance and any expression of pain by the patient is met with sympathy. A study of patients receiving injections of radiographic substances showed that their anxiety and pain were heightened by the use of negative words such as \"sting,\" \"burn,\" \"hurt,\" \"bad,\" and \"pain\" when ex-plaining the procedure or expressing sympathy (17). In another study, injection of local anesthetic preparatory to the induction of epidural anesthesia in women about to give birth was announced by saying either \"We are going to give you a local anesthetic that will numb the area so that you will be comfortable during the pro- cedure\" or \"You are going to feel a big bee sting; this is the worst part of the procedure.\" The perceived pain was significantly greater after the latter statement (median pain intensity 5 versus 3 on an 11-point scale) (18).BOX Unintended negative suggestion in everyday clinical practice (after 15, e5, e6) Causing uncertainty \"This medication may help.\" to meds regularly.\" Jargon \"We're wiring you up now.\" (connection to the monitoring device)\"Then we'll cut you into lots of thin slices.\" (computed tomography)\"Now we're hooking you up to the artificial nose.\" (attaching an oxygen mask)\"We looked for metastases\u2014the result was negative.\" Ambiguity \"We'll just finish you off.\" (preparation for surgery) \"We're putting you to sleep now, it'll soon be all over.\" (induction of anesthesia) \"I'll just fetch something from the 'poison cabinet' (secure storage for anesthetics), then we can start.\" Emphasizing the negative \"You are a high-risk patient.\" \"That always hurts a lot.\" \"You must strictly avoid lifting heavy objects\u2014you don't want to end up paralyzed.\" \"Your spinal canal is very narrow\u2014the spinal cord is being compressed.\" Focusing attention \"Are you feeling nauseous?\" (recovery room) \"Signal if you feel pain.\" (recovery room) Ineffective negation and trivialization \"You don't need to worry.\"\"It's just going to bleed The patient's expectations Just as the announcement that a drug is going to be given can provoke its side effects even if it is not ac- tually administered, telling headache patients that they are going to experience a mild electric current or an electromagnetic field (e.g., from cell phones) produces headaches (e7). The symptoms of Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation are more pronounced if they know their brain pacemaker is going to be turned off than if they do not know (e8). Nocebo phenomena in drug treatment Researchers distinguish true placebo effects from per-ceived placebo effects. The true placebo effect is the whole effect in the placebo group minus non-specific factors such as natural disease course, regression to the mean, and unidentified parallel interventions. The true placebo effect can be quantified only by comparing a placebo group and an untreated group (19). The true nocebo effect in double-blind drug trials thus includes all negative effects in placebo groups minus non- specific factors such as symptoms from the treated disease or comorbid conditions and adverse events of accompanying medication (4). The nocebo effects in drug trials referred to below are perceived rather than \"true\" nocebo effects. Adverse event profile and discontinuation rates in placebo groups of randomized trials A systematic review showed that in randomized con- trolled trials (RCTs) of migraine (69 studies in total, 56 of them with triptans, 9 with anticonvulsants, and 8 with non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs), the side effect profile of placebo corresponded with that of the \"true\" drug being tested (20). A systematic review of RCTs of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; 21 studies) and selec-tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; 122 studies) revealed a significantly higher rate of adverse events in both the verum and placebo arms of the TCA trials compared to the verum and placebo arms of the SSRI trials. Patients given TCA placebos were significantly more likely to report dry mouth (19.2% versus 6.4%), vision problems (6.9% versus 4.2%) than patients taking SSRI placebos (21). The side effects of medications therefore depend on what adverse events the patients and their treating physicians expect (20, 21). Rates of discontinuation owing to adverse effects of placebo in double-blind trials on patients with various diseases are presented in Table 1 . Problems in evaluating side effects of drugs The methods used for recording adverse events in-fluence the type and the frequency of effects reported: Patients specify more adverse events when checking off a standardized list of symptoms than when they report them spontaneously (21). In a large proportion of double-blind drug trials, the way in which subjective drug side effects were recorded is described inad-equately or not at all (22). The robustness of the data on which summaries of product characteristics and pack-age inserts are based must therefore be seen in a critical light. The problems in evaluating side effects of drugs in RCTs also apply in everyday clinical practice. Is the symptom reported by the patient\u2014nausea, for example\u2014a side effect of medication, a symptom of the disease being treated, a symptom of another disease, or a (temporary) indisposition unconnected with either the drug or the disease? Nocebo effects during drug treatment in everyday clinical practice Nocebo effects have been described in (Table 2): Drug exposure tests in the case of known drug allergy Perioperative administration of drugs Finasteride in benign prostate hyperplasiaTABLE 1 Systematic reviews: discontinuation rates in placebo arms of randomized trials owing to adverse events CI = confidence interval; * no data on pooled discontinuation rates Reference e9 e10 e10 e11 e11 e11 diseases: statins Multiple sclerosis: immune modulators Multiple sclerosis: symptomatic treatment Acute treatment of migraine Prevention of migraine Prevention of tension headache Painful peripheral diabetic polyneuropathy Fibromyalgia syndromeNumber of studies 20 56 44 59 31 4 62 58Discontinuation rate (%) 4-26 * 459-65MEDICINE Beta-blocker treatment of cardiovascular diseases Symptomatic treatment of fatigue in cancer pa- tients Lactose intolerance. The lactose content of tablets varies between 0.03 g and 0.5 g. Small amounts of lactose (up to 10 g) are tol-erated by almost all lactose-intolerant individuals. Therefore, complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms by lactose-intolerant patients who have been told by the physician or have found out for themselves that the tab-lets they are taking contain lactose may represent a nocebo effect (23). In Germany, the aut idem ruling by which pharma- cists may substitute a preparation with identical active ingredients for the product named on the prescription and discount agreements have led to complaints from patients and physicians of poor efficacy or increased adverse effects after switching to generic preparations. A cross-sectional survey conducted on behalf of the German Association of Pain Treatment ( Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schmerztherapie e.V Schmerzliga e.V . ) questioned 600 patients who had been switched to an oxycodone-containing generic preparation. Ninety percent were less satisfied with the analgesic effect, and 61% reported increased WHO III Opioids]: cross-sectional survey on the psychosocial consequences of substituting orig- inal preparations with generics for treatment of chronic pain in a stable/satisfactory treatment context [talk held on 8 March 2008 at a symposium sponsored by Mundipharma during the 19 th German Interdisciplinary Pain Congress]).TABLE 2 Nocebo effects in clinical studies *Worse ratings for sleep, appetite, and fatigue before the study were associated with a higher rate of reported adverse events; RCT = exposure test in known drug allergy Case series: exposure test in known drug allergy Two RCTs: fatigue in advanced cancer RCT: perioperative administration of drugs RCT: finasteride in benign prostate hyperplasia RCT: 50 mg atenolol in coronary heart disease RCT: 100 mg atenolol in coronary heart disease Acetylsalicylic acid versus sulfinpyrazone in unstable angina pectoris Controlled study of lactose intolerance Case report from RCT of antidepressantsNumber of patients 600 435 105 360 107 96 114 555 126 1Results 27% reported adverse events (nausea, stomach pains, itching) on placebo 32% reported adverse events (nausea, stomach pains, itching) on placebo 79% reported sleep problems, 53% loss of appetite, and 33% nausea on placebo* Undesired effects were reported by 5-8% of patients in the sodium chlo -ride group, 8% of patients in the midazolam-placebo group, and 3-8% of patients in the fentanyl-placebo group Blinded administration of finasteride led to a significantly higher rate of sexual dysfunction (44%) in the group that was informed of this possible effect than in the group that was not informed (15%) Rates of sexual dysfunction: 3% in the group that received information on neither drug nor side effect, 16% in the group that was informed about the drug but not about the possibility of sexual dysfunction, 31% in the group that was told about both the drug and the possible sexual dysfunction Rates of sexual dysfunction: 8% in the group that received information on neither drug nor side effect, 13% in the group that was informed about the drug but not about the possibility of sexual dysfunction, 32% in the group that was told about both the drug and the possible sexual dysfunction Inclusion of gastrointestinal side effects in the patient briefing at two of the three study centers led to a six-fold rise in the rate of discontinuation owing to subjective gastrointestinal side effects. The study centers with and without briefing on gastrointestinal side effects showed no difference in the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding or gastric or duodenal ulcers 44% of persons with known lactose intolerance and 26% of those without lactose intolerance complained of gastrointestinal symptoms after sham administration of lactose Severe hypotension requiring volume replacement after swallowing 26 placebo tablets with suicidal intent Deutsches \u00c4rzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2012; 109(26): 459-65 463MEDICINE A qualitative systematic review showed that patients with increased anxiety, depressivity, and somatization tendency are at greater risk of adverse events after switching to generic preparations (24). It must be discussed whether critical statements by medical opinion leaders (e22) and representatives of patients' self-help organizations (e23) on the substitution of powerful opioid preparations by generic equivalents might not be leading to nocebo effects. In the words of one such statement: \"The consequences of substitution are always the same: more pain or more adverse events\" (e23). Expectations that a treatment will be poorly toler- ated, whether based on experience or induced by information from the media or trusted third parties, may bring about nocebo effects. A systematic review and meta-analysis found a robust association between the expectation and the occurrence of nausea after chemotherapy (e24). Ethical implications and the dilemma of the patient briefing On one hand physicians are obliged to inform the patient about the possible adverse events of a proposed treatment so that he/she can make an informed decision (e25). On the other, it is the physician's duty to mini-mize the risks of a medical intervention for the patient, including those entailed by the briefing (25). However, the studies just cited show that the patient briefing can induce nocebo responses. The following strategies are suggested to reduce this dilemma: Focus on tolerability: Information about the fre- quency of possible adverse events can be formulated positively (\"the great majority of patients tolerate this treatment very well\") or negatively (\"5% of patients report...\") (4). A study on briefing in the context of influenza vaccination showed that fewer adverse events were reported after vaccination by the group told what proportion of persons tolerated the procedure well than by those informed what proportion experienced adverse events (e26). Permitted non-information: Before the prescrip- tion of a drug, the patient is asked whether he/she agrees to receive no information about mild and/or transient side effects. The patient must, however, be briefed about severe and/or irreversible side effects (5). \"A relatively small proportion of patients who take Drug X experience various side effects that they find bothersome but are not life threatening or severely im-pairing. Based on research, we know that patients who are told about these sorts of side effects are more likely to experience them than those who are not told. Do you want me to inform you about these side effects or not?\" (5). To respect patients' autonomy and preferences, they can be given a list of categories of possible adverse events for the medication/procedure in question. Each individual patient can then decide which categories of side effects he/she definitely wants to be briefed about and for which categories information can be dispensed with (e27). Patient education: A systematic review (four studies, 400 patients) of patients with chronic pain showed that training from a pharmacist\u2014e.g., general information on medicinal and non-medicinal pain treat-ment or on the recording of possible side effects of drugs and guidance in the case of their occurrence\u2014re- duced the number of side effects of medications from 4.6 to 1.6 (95% confidence interval of difference: 0.7-5.3) (e28). Perspectives Communication training with actor-patients or role-plays during medical studies or in curricula for psycho- somatic basic care impart the ability to harness the \"power\" of the physician's utterances selectively for the patient's benefit (e29, e30). Skill in conveying posi-tive suggestions and avoiding negative ones should also receive more attention in nurse training. The German Medical Association's recommen- dations on patient briefing, published in 1990 (e25), urgently require updating. The points that need to be discussed include, for example, whether it is legitimate to express a right of the patient not to know about com-plications and side effects of medical procedures and whether this must be respected by the physician. Furthermore, it has to be debated whether some pa-tients might not be left confused and uncertain by their inability to follow the legally mandatory comprehen-sive information on potential complications of medical treatments that is found, for example, on package in- serts or multipage information and consent documents.

Weissenfeld phenomenon and medical ethics: rethinking the relationship between informed consent and risk-benefit Med Bioeth to: www.aerzteblatt-international.de/ref2612KEY MESSAGES Every medical treatment (e.g., drug administration, psychotherapy) has specific and non-specific effects. Specific effects result from the characteristic elements of the intervention. The beneficial non-specific effects of a treatment are referred to as placebo effects, the harm-ful ones as nocebo effects. Placebo and nocebo effects are viewed as psycho - biological phenomena that arise from the therapeutic context in its entirety (sham treatments, the patients' treatment expectations and previous experience, verbal and non-verbal communications by the person adminis-tering the treatment, and the interaction between that person and the patient). Nocebo responses may result from unintended negative suggestion by physicians or nurses. The frequency of adverse events is increased by brief-ing patients about the possible complications of treat-ment and by negative expectations on the part of the patient. Some of the subjective side effects of drugs can be at-tributed to nocebo effects. 9.

James Rubin King's College London Objectives: Medication side effects are common, often leading to reduced quality of life, nonadherence, and financial costs for health services. Many side effects are the result of a psychologically mediated\"nocebo effect.\" This review identifies the risk factors involved in the development of nocebo effects.Method: Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Journals@Ovid full text, and Global Health were searched using the terms \"nocebo\" and \"placebo effect.\" To be included, studies must have exposedpeople to an inert substance and have assessed 1 or more baseline or experimental factor(s) on its abilityto predict symptom development in response to the inert exposure. Results: Eighty-nine studies were included; 70 used an experimental design and 19 used a prospective design, identifying 14 differentcategories of risk factor. The strongest predictors of nocebo effects were a higher perceived dose ofexposure, explicit suggestions that the exposure triggers arousal or symptoms, observing people expe-riencing symptoms from the exposure, and higher expectations of symptoms. Conclusions: To reduce nocebo induced symptoms associated with medication or other interventions clinicians could reduceexpectations of symptoms, limit suggestions of symptoms, correct unrealistic dose perceptions, andreduce exposure to people experiencing side effects. There is some evidence that we should do thisespecially for persons with at-risk personality types, though exactly which personality types these arerequires further research. These suggestions have a downside in terms of consent and paternalism, butthere is scope to develop innovative ways to reduce nocebo effects without withholding information. Keywords: inert exposure, nocebo effect, predictors, review, symptoms Supplemental materials: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0000416.supp Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common ( Davies et al., 2009 ), and can have serious implications in terms of patient well-being and adherence ( Ammassari et al., 2001 ) as well as significant financial costs for health services ( NICE, 2009 ; Rodr\u00edguez-Mongui\u00f3, Otero, & Rovira, 2003 ). However, ADRs are not always related to the physiological action of the medication(Faasse & Petrie, 2013 ). Only 10.9% of reported ADRs to com- monly prescribed drugs are clearly attributable to the medication(de Frutos Hernansanz et al., 1994 ). It is thought a nocebo effect may play a role in the formation of other apparent side effects(Barsky, Saintfort, Rogers, & Borus, 2002 ). As well as medication side effects, nocebo effects have been implicated in symptomsattributed to technological exposures such as electro-magneticfields (EMF) from mobile phones and Wi-Fi ( ;Rubin, Cleare, & Wessely, 2008 ). A nocebo effect is the experience of negative symptoms following exposure to an inertsubstance, which are triggered or exacerbated by psychologicalmechanisms such as expectations ( Kennedy, 1961 ). The name \"nocebo\" was created to distinguish between the desirable (\"pla-cebo\") and undesirable effects of an inert exposure ( H\u00e4user, Han- sen, & Enck, 2012 ), although in practice the distinction between undesirable and desirable is not always clear cut. For exampleincreased alertness may be beneficial in some contexts (e.g., priorto an examination) and detrimental in others (e.g., prior to sleep). Current literature suggests there are three main mechanisms for a nocebo effect; misattribution, expectation, and learning. Misat-tribution theory suggests that people misattribute preexistingsymptoms to the effects of a new exposure (although some authorsbelieve that misattribution does not technically constitute a noceboeffect, see Colloca & Miller, 2011 andEnck, Bingel, Schedlowski, & Rief, 2013 ). Symptoms are common in everyday life ( Petrie, Faasse, Crichton, & Grey, 2014 ), and although often harmless and short-lived, when people are subjected to a new exposure, symp-toms that were present before or occur coincidentally are available to be mistakenly attributed to it ( Petrie et al., 2005 ;Petrie, Moss- Morris, Grey, & Shaw, 2004 ). Therefore factors such as high baseline symptoms or high self-awareness may serve as risk fac-tors for nocebo effects resulting from this mechanism. Negativeexpectations can also mediate nocebo effects ( Hahn, 1997 ), and may in turn arise through explicit suggestions about the effects ofan exposure ( Ja\u00e9n & Dalton, 2014 ;Myers, Cairns, & Singer, 1987 ), or predisposing factors such as pessimism ( Geers, Helfer, This article was published Online First September 22, 2016.

These negative expectations can make the individual more likely to attend to new or currentsensations, and attribute them to the exposure ( Barsky et al., 2002 ). The response expectancy theory suggests that it is also possible fornegative expectations to act more directly, with an expectation of,for example anxiety, being itself anxiety provoking thereby di-rectly causing the negative effect that was expected ( Kirsch, 1997a ,1997b ). The last mechanism, learning, can elicit nocebo effects through association or social observation. For example, ifan inert stimulus has been previously paired with a symptom-inducing stimulus ( Barsky et al., 2002 ), which may occur through conscious or nonconscious mechanisms ( Stewart-Williams, 2004 ), or through observing someone else experience symptoms to thesame exposure ( V\u00f6gtle, Barke, & Kroner-Herwig, 2013 ). Given the significant costs nocebo effects can have on patient quality of life and health services it is important to developinterventions to minimize these effects from occurring. Many riskfactors have been implicated, but no study has systematicallyreviewed these to identify those which are the strongest predictorsof nocebo effects; something that would assist in the developmentof such interventions. Instead, previous systematic reviews havefocused on the magnitude of nocebo effects for a specific symp-tom, for example, Petersen et al. (2014) or in clinical trials of experimental medical treatments ( H\u00e4user, Bartram, Adelasoye, & Cheyne, 2015 ) has provided a preliminary assessment of some of the risk factors involved in nocebo effects. However this \"scop-ing review\" identified only 17 papers\u2014a limited subset of theavailable literature. To address this gap our systematic reviewaimed to identify the risk factors involved in the reporting of anysymptom in response to an inert exposure. This will allow theidentification of factors which appear to be consistent predictors ofnocebo effects and aid in the development of evidenced-basedinterventions to prevent them from occurring in the future. Method Identification of Studies Searches were carried out on December 11, 2014, using the following databases: Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Psyc-INFO, Ovid, and Global Health. The search terms consisted of\"nocebo\" or \"placebo effect,\" and where available, searches werelimited to studies with a human sample, with review articlesrestricted. The reference sections of included studies were alsoexamined as well as papers suggested through personal contacts.No gray literature was searched and no temporal constraints wereused. The review followed a previously designed, unpublishedprotocol. Selection Criteria Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: \u0081 Studied a human population (healthy volunteers, patients or children were allowed). \u0081 Used an experimental or prospective design.\u0081 Used an inert exposure, that is, containing no pharmaco- logical or physiological active ingredient.\u0081 Assessed factors on their ability to predict symptom report- ing, and these factors could be baseline characteristics orexperimentally induced. \u0081 Included an outcome of symptom reporting after partici- pants received an inert exposure. Reported symptoms mustnot have been attributable to an active exposure (e.g.,studies where an inert exposure was applied after an activeexposure such as heat stimulation were excluded, as in thiscase the symptoms would have resulted from the heatstimulation). \u0081 Measured symptoms via self-report or inferred through objective measures (e.g., scratching behavior). Such symp-toms could be somatic, a measure of arousal or mood.Because of the difficulty in defining when an outcome isaversive or beneficial we took an inclusive approach. Forexample measures of alertness (where an increase could beaversive in some instances) or contentedness (where de-creases might be possible) were both included. \u0081 Published in any language. Data Extraction For each study included in the review, details relating to 20 issues were extracted. In summary these related to: sample char-acteristics, methodological design, type of exposure, experimentalconditions and/or baseline risk factors, symptom measurement,statistical analysis, and results. Any non-English articles weretranslated. We differentiated between studies that used an experi-mental or a prospective design to easily identify factors implicatedin nocebo effects that can be manipulated and those that naturallyoccur at baseline. For a copy of the data extraction sheet used, seeAppendix 1 in the supplemental materials. Quality Assessment Eligible studies using an experimental design were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool ( Higgins et al., 2011 ). For prospective studies, the CASPin International (1998) critical appraisal tool was used and adapted to give a \"high,\" \"unclear,\" or \"low\" risk of bias score, which were colorcoded red, orange, and green, respectively. Originally the CASP isscored with yes/no answers but this was rescored to low risk (yes)and high risk (no) as well as including an unclear risk response forwhen enough information was not provided, similar to the Co-chrane Risk of Bias tool. As these tools had no criteria assessingsample size we looked at this separately. Review Process Rebecca K. Webster conducted the database searches and screened the titles and abstracts of articles to assess their potentialrelevance. Guidance was obtained from G. James Rubin if therewas any uncertainty as to including an article for full text review.Rebecca K. Webster obtained the full articles for those citationsthat appeared potentially relevant and checked them against theinclusion criteria. If it was unclear whether an article met theinclusion criteria, consensus was sought from G. James Rubin andJohn Weinman, Rebecca K. Webster then independently extracteddata for each included study and carried out the quality assessmentThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

James Rubin Because of the expected heterogeneity in the studies we did not plan for any meta-analysesand instead we used a narrative synthesis. There is no generalconsensus on the best way to carry out a narrative synthesis forsystematic reviews ( Popay et al., 2006 ). As such we decided to use a weight of evidence approach. To do this, we identified thestrength of evidence for each risk factor based on the number ofstudies investigating each risk factors and their respective quality. Results Search Results The database search retrieved 12,582 citations. After removing duplicates 6,585 citations remained. After screening titles andabstracts, we reviewed the full text of 88 articles relating to 96studies. Of these, 13 studies were excluded for not investigatingany risk factors for the development of symptoms, nine wereexcluded for using an active exposure and seven were excluded fornot measuring symptoms. Sixty-six articles met the inclusion cri-teria. Twenty-one additional articles were identified by referencechecks of included articles and through personal contacts; resultingin a total of 87 articles. Two articles reported results on twoseparate studies each ( Walach & Schneider, 2009 ;Winters et al., 2001 ) and are referred to as \"Exp 1\" or \"Exp 2\" where necessary, leaving 87 articles reporting on 89 studies. Of these, 70 wereexperimental (see Table 1 ) and 19 prospective (see Table 2 ). Figure 1 provides a flow diagram of the study selection according to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement ( Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009 ). Quality Assessment Experimental studies. The quality of experimental studies was poor (see Figure 2 ), with the main problem being a lack of clear reporting. Thirty-six studies neglected to mention how theycarried out randomization, whereas 22 studies were at high risk ofbias for failing to mention whether participants were randomizedor for not using randomization at all. Because of the unclearreporting of random sequence generation, the risk for allocationconcealment bias followed a similar pattern. For blinding of par-ticipants and personnel, studies often failed to state whether theexperimenters were blind to the manipulation that accompaniedthe exposure, leaving the risk of bias unclear. Only six studies usedadequate blinding procedures, with 12 not using blinding at all.Sixty-five studies used self-report measures, as such blinding ofthe outcome assessment was judged to be unlikely to influencethese results. For 52 studies, drop outs were not addressed, or ifthey were, they typically failed to explain how this affected theresults, leaving the risk of bias unclear. Only one study had lodgeda protocol in a publically accessible registry before the start ofrecruitment, leaving us unable to assess the risk for selectivereporting for the remaining studies. As well as this we looked forjustification of sample size to assess if each study was adequatelypowered. Again this was poorly addressed, with only 9 of the 70studies mentioning that they carried out an a priori sample sizecalculation. Prospective studies. The prospective studies performed well against the quality check (see Figure 2 ). All studies addressed aclearly focused issue with a standardized exposure across all participants. Studies often lacked information about how partici-pants were recruited. However, self-report measures were widelyused to minimize bias from experimenters. The identification andcontrol of confounding factors was only deemed an issue for sixstudies that neglected to control for demographic factors such asgender or age and past symptom reporting. The follow-up ofparticipants was judged to be appropriate in 16 studies. Regardingthe generalizability of the findings, it was often difficult to knowwhether the results could be applied to the population beingstudied because of the insufficient information about how partic-ipants were recruited. In addition, similarly to the experimentalstudies, justification for sample size was limited with only onestudy providing an a priori sample size calculation. Experimentally Induced Risk Factors Categories Seventy experimental studies were included that investigated risk factors which fell into 9 different categories as discussedbelow (further details in supplementary Tables 3-11). Learning. Twenty-three studies manipulated different types of learning on symptom reporting finding some evidence for itsrole in nocebo effects. Four of these investigated prior experienceof which two lower quality studies found no significant effects(Bayer, Coverdale, Chiang, & Bangs, 1998 ;Dinnerstein & Halm, 1970 ). However, Andr\u00e9-Obadia, Magnin, and Garcia-Larrea (2011) showed that sham rTMS tended to worsen patients' pain when following an active yet unsuccessful rTMS treatment (how-ever caution is required as no statistical test accompanied thisfinding), and a high-quality study by Stegen et al. (1998) found that participants reported significantly more arousal and respira-tory symptoms when completing a breathing trial with room airbefore a breathing trial with carbon dioxide rather than afterward.As such there is some evidence that prior experience is involved inthe development of nocebo effects. Two studies of mixed qualityexplored the impact of implicit association supporting its role inthe nocebo effect, finding that drinking sham caffeine in a coffeesolution resulted in significantly more alertness, contentedness,and arousal, than drinking sham caffeine in an orange juice solu-tion ( Flaten & Blumenthal, 1999 ;Mikalsen, Bertelsen, & Flaten, 2001 ). Three studies of high quality investigated learning through the manipulation of social observation, with two finding a signif-icant effect, broadly supporting its role in the nocebo effect.Lorber, Mazzoni, and Kirsch (2007) failed to show any main effects of observing a confederate display symptom behaviors afterinhaling a sham environmental toxin which they were also exposedto. However, in a similar study, participants who observed aconfederate display symptoms had significantly higher symptomratings after inhalation than participants who did not ( Mazzoni, Foan, Hyland, & Kirsch, 2010 ). Similarly, patients who watched a video of people scratching compared to those who saw a video ofpeople sitting idle had higher itch and scratching behavior ratingafter administration of sham histamine ( Papoiu, Wang, Coghill, Chan, & Yosipovitch, 2011 ), no results were reported for the healthy volunteers in this study. Of the remaining 14 studies, 13 investigated learning by using classical conditioning to pair inert exposures such as odors withCO2 inhalation before presenting the inert exposures on their own(De Peuter et al., 2005 ;Devriese, De Peuter, Van Diest, Van deThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Six studies of mixed quality found significant effects of classical conditioning and although seven found no main effect of condi-tioning on symptom reporting, six of these were of lower quality.As such there is some evidence for the role of classical condition-ing in nocebo effects, and that this learning effect can be gener-alized to new odors (Devriese et al., 2000; Van den Bergh et al., 1997, 1998). However, odor type alone without classical condi- tioning is not enough to elicit symptoms as demonstrated in thisgroup of studies and the remaining study in this category ( Dalton, 1999). Perceived dose. Six studies manipulated participant percep- tions of the dose of the exposure that they received. Four of thesefound significant effects with three being of higher quality, broadlysupporting a link between higher perceived dose and noceboeffects. Only two studies found no significant effects of doserelated to decaffeinated coffee consumption (Flaten, Aasli, &Blumenthal, 2003) or taking a sham sedative pill (Jensen &Karoly, 1991). The remaining four all demonstrated significantmain effects: Increasing the setting on a sham shock generatorincreased pain intensity ratings in two studies ( Bayer, Baer, & Early, 1991; Bayer et al., 1998), tension scores increased as a function of perceived dose following decaffeinated coffee con-sumption in one study ( Kirsch & Weixel, 1988), and in a final study being told that a sham EMF exposure would be strongresulted in a higher overall symptom scores compared to being toldthe exposure would be weak (Szemerszky, K\u00f6teles, Lihi, & Bar-dos, 2010). Self-awareness. Four studies manipulated self-awareness dur- ing exposure. Three higher quality studies found no significanteffects with only one lower quality study reporting an effect. Assuch there is little evidence that self-awareness increases thelikelihood of a nocebo effect. Both Geers, al. (2005) and Geers, Helfer, Weiland, and Kosbab (2006) showed no significant main effects of instructing participants to attend to any symptomsor sensations they experienced. Using a distraction task also didnot have a significant effect on symptom reporting (Van den Berghet al., 1998). Gibbons, Carver, Scheier, and Hormuth (1979) , however, did find a significant main effect, with participantsfacing a mirror reporting less perceived arousal than participantsnot facing a mirror following ingestion of a sham drug. Type of administration. Two studies of mixed quality tested whether type of administration affects symptom reporting, findingno evidence for a link with nocebo effects. There was no differencein symptom reporting between a sham pill and either a salineinjection (Goldman, Witton, & Scherer, 1965) or sham acupunc-ture (Kaptchuk et al., 2006). Verbal suggestions on performance. Three studies manipu- lated verbal suggestions about the effect an inert exposure wouldhave on performance. Two higher quality studies found no signif-icant effects with only one lower quality study reporting an effect.As such there is little evidence that suggesting an exposure impairsperformance increases the likelihood of a nocebo effect. BothHarrell and Juliano (2009) andNevelsteen, Legros, and Crasson (2007) found no significant main effects of suggesting sham coffee or sham EMF would enhance or impair performance on a task onany of their symptom measures, respectively. However, smokerstold that a sham cigarette would impair performance had signifi-cantly more craving symptoms than those who were told it wouldenhance performance (Harrell & Juliano, 2012). Verbal suggestions of likelihood of exposure. Nine studies manipulated suggestions about the likelihood that an exposurewould occur. All studies were of higher quality with four finding Figure 2.

In other words, there was mixed evidence for the role of likelihood sug-gestions in nocebo effects. The studies used a mixture of condi-tions in which participants were either told they would receive anactive exposure (deception), might receive an active or inactiveexposure (double-blind), would receive an inactive exposure(open) or nothing (control). Five of the studies found no significantmain effects ( Geers, Helfer, et al., 2005 ;Geers et al., 2006 ;Ossege et al., 2005 ;Walach, Schmidt, Dirhold, & Nosch, 2002 ;Walach & Schneider, 2009 1). Geers, Wellman, Fowler, Rasinski, and Helfer (2011) , however, found that participants reported signifi- cantly more side effects in response to a sham pill when givendeceptive information, compared with double-blind or controlinformation. In addition, participants given deceptive or double-blind suggestions had a significantly higher increase in alertnessfollowing ingestion of sham coffee ( Kirsch & Weixel, 1988 ) and a significantly higher number of adverse events following a shamweight loss supplement ( Tippens et al., 2014 ) than participants in the control condition. For Walach, Schmidt, Bihr, and Wiesch (2001) participants told they would receive an inactive exposure scored higher on general wellbeing than those who received nosubstance or instruction. Verbal suggestions of arousal. Sixteen studies manipulated suggestions about the effect an inert exposure would have onarousal. Thirteen studies showed a significant effect, with 10 ofthese being of higher quality. This strongly supports a link withnocebo effects. Only three studies revealed no main effects ( Bro- deur, 1965 ;Kuenzel, Blanchette, ;Penick & Fisher, 1965 ). The remaining 13 all demonstrated significant effects. Participants given stimulant suggestions com-pared to sedative suggestions had higher tension scores and weremore lively after administration of a sham drug ( Flaten, Simonsen, & Olsen, 1999 ;Mrna & Skrivanek, 1985 ), and had higher scores of stress, arousal, alertness, friendliness and aggressiveness, andlower fatigue scores after ingestion of an inert drink ( Dinnerstein & Halm, 1970 ).Higuchi, Shoji, and Hatayama (2002) demonstrated lower stress and stimulant symptoms for participants given relax-ing suggestions compared to no information for lavender andjasmine fragrances respectively. Goldman et al. (1965) found that more patients reported suggested drug effects in a sedative condi-tion than in a stimulant condition. The remaining studies found asignificant increase in caffeine related symptoms ( Geers, Weiland, Kosbab, & Helfer, Brooks, 1996 ), and alertness ( Schneider et al., 2006 ;Walach & Schneider, 2009 Exp 2) and a significant decrease in calmness ( Mikalsen et al., 2001 ) for participants told they would receive caffeine com- pared to participants who were told they would not receive caf-feine or who received no beverage. Finally, Angelucci and Pena (1997) found that participants given coffee with low arousal ex- pectations had significantly lower alertness compared to partici-pants given coffee with no expectations, high arousal expectations,or no coffee at all. Verbal suggestions of symptoms. Twenty-one studies ma- nipulated suggestions about what symptoms to expect from aninert exposure. Thirteen found a significant effect, with 11 of thesebeing of higher quality, broadly supporting a link with noceboeffects. Of the 21 studies, eight reported no significant main effects(Devriese et al., 2004 ,2006 ;Heatherton, Polivy, & Herman, 1989 ;Ja\u00e9n & Dalton, 2014 ;Schweiger & Parducci, 1981 ;Walach et al., 2002 ;Winters et al., 2003 ;Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ). For the remaining 13 studies, Amanzio, Casadio, Oliaro, and Maggi (1997) ;Crichton, Dodd, Schmid, and Petrie (2014) ;Wise et al. (2009) and Pennebaker and Skelton (1981) found significantly higher symptoms scores for those warnedabout side effects compared to those not warned after administra-tion of sham treatment, infrasound, and ultrasonic noise, respec-tively. Dalton (1999) ,Neukirch and Colagiuri (2015) , and Put et al. (2004) found that participants' symptoms were significantly consistent with the warning they received about an odor, shamsleep medication, and sham inhaler, respectively. Three studiesdemonstrated that participants experienced significantly moresymptoms when informed about side effects to a sham drug(Gibbons et al., 1979 ;Zimmermann-Viehoff et al., 2013 ) or eye drops ( Gavrylyuk, Ehrt, & Meissner, 2010 ) compared with being informed it was a placebo. Similarly both Bayer et al. (1991) andRead and Bohr (2014) established significantly higher symp- toms scores for those informed they would receive an activecompared to an inactive exposure. Colagiuri, McGuinness, Boakes, and Butow (2012) , however, found the opposite; partici- pants not warned about the side effects experienced more and agreater severity of side effects than those warned about one or fourside effects. Miscellaneous. Six studies looked at factors that did not fit into the above categories. There was no significant effect ofmanipulating participants to cooperate ( Geers, Weiland, et al., 2005 participants' symp- et al., 2001 ). However, Faasse, Cundy, Gamble, and Petrie (2013) found that manipulating tablet brand to make partic- ipants think they had changed to a generic version resulted in asignificantly higher number of symptoms compared with partici-pants told that they were still taking the original branded tablet,although this study was of lower quality than the others in thisgroup. Jensen and Karoly (1991) have shown that manipulating social desirability so that participants think responding to the pillis more socially desirable results in significantly higher symptomscores. Type of breathing has also been shown to affect symptomreporting with normocapnic overbreathing resulting in higher re-spiratory symptoms compared with spontaneous breathing ( Van Diest et al., 2006 ). Lastly, a conditioned odor results in more symptoms if the odor is presented immediately rather than a weekafter conditioning trials ( Devriese et al., 2000 ). Baseline Risk Factors Categories Nineteen prospective studies and also 33 experimental studies which assessed baseline risk factors were included which fell intosix different categories as discussed below (further details insupplementary Tables 12-17). Demographics. Twenty studies looked at the risk of demo- graphic characteristics, finding no demonstrable evidence for theirrole in nocebo effects. Five of these investigated age and found itdid not predict any symptom outcomes ( de la Cruz, Hui, Parsons, & Bruera, 2010 ;Geers, Helfer, et al., 2005 ;Goetz et al., 2008 ; Lombardi, Gargioni, Canonica, & Passalacqua, 2008 ;Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ). As four of these studies were of higher quality, this is good evidence that age is not linked with the development ofnocebo effects. Eighteen studies ( Angelucci & Pena, 1997 ;Casper,This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.1346 WEBSTER, WEINMAN, AND RUBINTollefson, & Nilsson, 2001 ;Geers, Helfer, et al., 2005 ;Geers et al., 2011 ;Goetz et al., 2008 ;Harrell & Juliano, 2012 ;Jensen & Karoly, 1991 ;Liccardi et al., 2004 ;Lombardi et al., 2008 ;Lorber et al., 2007 ;Mazzoni et al., 2010 ;Papoiu et al., 2011 ;Read & Bohr, 2014 ;Strohle, 2000 ;Van den Bergh et al., 1997 ,1998 ; Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ) looked at gender and only four reported significant results suggesting women are more susceptible to no-cebo effects than men ( Casper et al., 2001 ;Liccardi et al., 2004 ; Strohle, 2000 ;Szemerszky et al., 2010 ). Of the remaining 14 showing nonsignificant effects, 12 were of high quality, suggestingthere is very little evidence for the role of gender in nocebo effects.The effects of level of education ( de la Cruz et al., 2010 ;Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ) were equivocal in two high quality studies, whereas employment Drici, Raybaud, Delunardo, Iacono, & Gus- tovic, 1995 ) was not a significant predictor. Clinical characteristics. Fourteen studies investigated clini- cal characteristics, finding mixed evidence for a link with noceboeffects. Six studies of high quality looked at the effect of baselinesymptom scores, finding mixed evidence for a link with noceboeffects. Two found no significant effects ( Andr\u00e9-Obadia et al., 2011 ;Casper et al., 2001 ). For the other four, results were mixed. Danker-Hopfe, Dorn, Bornkessel, and Sauter (2010) and de la Cruz et al. (2010) found that higher symptom scores at baseline predicted higher symptom scores after exposure to sham EMF andtreatment respectively, whereas Flaten et al. (2003) andGoetz et al. (2008) found the opposite after drinking decaffeinated coffee and taking sham medication for Parkinson's respectively. Sixstudies of high quality looked at the effect of type of clinicalcondition, with five finding a significant effect. They showed thatsuffering from a condition that is exacerbated by the suggestedsham exposure significantly increased symptom reporting com-pared to healthy volunteers, strongly supporting a link with noceboeffects. Nevelsteen et al. (2007) found that depression did not predict symptoms in response to a sham magnetic field. However,De Peuter et al. (2005) ;Papoiu et al. (2011) ;Strohle (2000) and Bogaerts et al. (2010) showed that suffering from atopic dermati- tis, panic disorder, asthma, or medically unexplained dyspnearesulted in significantly more symptoms in response to shamhistamine, sham panic disorder trigger, sham inhaler, and breath-ing trials with room air, respectively, compared with healthyvolunteers. In addition, Szemerszky et al. (2010) found that the level of perceived sensitivity to EMFs was positively correlatedwith symptom scores after sham EMF exposure. The remainingtwo studies looked at previous drug reactions finding weak evi-dence for a link with nocebo effects. Lombardi et al. (2008) found no significant effects of type or severity of previous drug reactionon symptoms in response to a sham allergen pill. However, ahigher quality study by Mra and Skir v\u00e1nek (1985) found the reaction to another sham drug was significantly correlated withperceived drug effect. Expectations. Thirteen studies looked at the effect of partic- ipant expectations on symptom reporting, broadly supporting a link with nocebo effects. Eleven of these studies looked at partic-ipants' symptom expectations, of which five higher quality studiesrevealed no significant effects ( Angelucci & Pena, 1997 ;Molca n et al., 1982 ;Walach et al., 2001 ;Walach & Schneider, 2009 Exp 1 and 2). The remaining six studies demonstrated that expectationsof symptoms significantly predicted ( Fillmore & Vogel-Sprott, 1992 ;K\u00f6teles & Babulka, 2014 ;Vase et al., 2013 ) or correlated(De Peuter et al., 2005 ;Flaten et al., 2003 ;Szemerszky et al., 2010 ) with symptom reporting. Five of these studies were of higher quality therefore broadly supporting a link with noceboeffects. Three studies also looked at expectations in terms of thesubstance taken finding weak evidence for its role in noceboeffects. Link, Haggard, Kelly, and Forrer (2006) found that par- ticipants who believed they had taken an active pill reported moresymptoms than those who thought they had a taken a sham pill,however this was a low quality study. Higher quality studies byBayer et al. (1998) andWalach et al. (2001) also investigated this but found no significant effects. Anxiety. Nine studies looked at the influence of anxiety on symptom reporting, finding weak evidence for a link with noceboeffects. Six studies of mixed quality looked at state anxiety ( Bo- gaerts et al., 2010 ;Link et al., 2006 ;Molca n et al., 1982 ;Nevel- steen et al., 2007 ;Szemerszky et al., 2010 ;Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ) but only Nevelsteen et al. (2007) found a significant effect, with state anxiety predicting physical symptom scores. Molca n et al. (1982) andNevelsteen et al. (2007) found no significant effects of trait anxiety. Angelucci and Pena (1997) found combined state and trait anxiety scores significantly predicted anxiety, but did notreport results for state and trait anxiety separately. However, nosuch effect of combined state and trait anxiety was found onsymptom reporting to an odor ( Van den Bergh et al., 1997 ), although this was a lower quality study. Finally, a high qualitystudy by Danker-Hopfe et al. (2010) found that anxiety toward a local base station predicted subjective sleep quality after shamEMF exposure. Personality. Twenty-two studies looked at different aspects of personality as predictors of symptoms. Twelve studies showedsignificant effects of personality of which only three were of lowquality as such finding evidence broadly supporting a link withnocebo effects. There were no significant effects of suggestibility(Angelucci & Pena, 1997 ), sensitivity to anxiety ( Nevelsteen et al., 2007 ), restraint ( Heatherton et al., 1989 ), or social desirability (Link et al., 2006 ;Put et al., 2004 ;Stegen, Van Diest, Van de Woestijne, & Van den Bergh, 2000 ). However, studies did show significant effects of the following on at least one symptom out-come: Type A personalities reported more side effects than TypeB(Drici et al., 1995 ); pain catastrophizing positively correlated with side effect reports ( Sullivan, Lynch, Clark, Mankovsky, & Sawynok, 2008 ); blunting behavior predicted symptom reporting (Van den Bergh et al., 1997 ); positive affect and vigilance pre- dicted symptom scores ( Nevelsteen et al., 2007 ); \"frail and sub- missive\" personality correlated with the exposures perceived effect(Sl\u00e1nsk\u00e1 et al., 1974 ); somatization and motivation predicted symptom score ( Szemerszky et al., 2010 ); and modern health worries and somatosensory amplification predicted symptomscores ( Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ). There was mixed evidence for the role of negative affect ( Bogaerts et al., 2010 ;De Peuter et al., 2005 ,2007 ;Devriese et al., 2000 ,2004 ;Nevelsteen et al., 2007 ; Put et al., 2004 ;Stegen et al., 1998 ,2000 ;Van den Bergh et al., 1995 ), neuroticism ( Davis, Ralevski, Kennedy, & Neitzert, 1995 al., 2010 ), and pessimism ( Geers, Helfer, et al., 2005 ; Szemerszky et al., 2010 ). Miscellaneous. Thirteen studies looked at baseline factors which did not fit into the above categories. These included caffeineconsumption ( Geers, Weiland, et al., 2005 ;Geers ), olfactory sensitivity ( Dalton, 1999 ), perceived cue odor ( DevrieseThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.1347 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF NOCEBO EFFECT RISK FACTORSet al., 2004 ), visibility of a mobile phone base station and preoc- cupation with EMF ( Danker-Hopfe et al., 2010 ), site of enrolment ( Goetz et al., 2008 ), hospital center ( Liccardi et al., 2004 ), stress experienced while wearing a helmet delivering sham EMF ( Nevelsteen et al., 2007 ), ability to predict which odor produced the most symptoms ( Meulders et al., 2010 ), and risk perception ( Nevelsteen et al., 2007 ), which had no significant effects. K\u00f6teles and Babulka (2014) , however, found that odor pleasantness predicted perceived change in alertness for eucalyp-tus oil. In addition, odor reactivity predicted symptom respondingto odors ( Dalton, 1999 ) and high regard for medications positively correlated with perceived drug effect ( Goldman et al., 1965 ). Mazzoni et al. (2010) found that if the gender of the model matched the participant this predicted symptom development insocial observation studies. Nevelsteen et al. (2007) found that less comfort under the helmet delivering the sham EMF predictedsymptoms. Finally, Wendt et al. (2014) reported that significantly more symptoms were reported in val/val homozygous carrierscompared to val 158/Met 18 and Met/Met 158 homozygous car-riers after sham treatment. Interactions Between Risk Factor Categories As well as investigating the main effects of each risk factor, some studies assessed the interactions between risk factors, asdisplayed in the last column of Tables 3 through 17. Those risk factors which were implicated often in these interactions were factorssuch as \"likelihood suggestion\" which interacted with: \"pessi-mism\"\u2014participants given deceptive suggestions report more symp-toms compared to those told it was an inactive pill, if they were pessimists ( Geers, Helfer, et al., 2005 ); \"self-awareness\"\u2014partic- ipants given deceptive suggestions reported more symptoms whenasked to monitor their bodily sensations ( Geers et al., 2006 ); and \"perceived dose\"\u2014tension increased with increasing coffee dosefor those given deceptive suggestions, but decreased with increas-ing coffee dose when given double-blind suggestions ( Kirsch & Weixel, 1988 ). In addition, \"classical conditioning\" showed interactions with \"odor\"; pairing an odor with CO2 elicited symptoms to the odoralone, only if the odor was foul smelling ( Devriese et al., 2000 ; Van den Bergh et al., 1995 ,1997 ;Winters et al., 2003 ). This interaction between \"classical conditioning\" and \"odor\" was alsofound to more likely occur among people with high \"negativeaffect\" ( Devriese et al., 2000 ) and those manipulated to have higher \"self-awareness\" ( Van den Bergh et al., 1998 ). Negative also interacted with \"symptom suggestions,\" with higherobstruction and dyspnea symptom scores after suggestions ofbronchoconstriction compared to bronchodilation for a sham in-haler if participants had high negative affect ( Put et al., 2004 ). An interaction was also found with \"prior experience,\" with highnegative affect participants reporting more arousal and symptomson the whole to a room-air breathing trial when this precededrather than followed a CO2 breathing trial ( Stegen et al., 1998 ). As well as interacting with negative affect, symptom sugges- tions interacted with other factors. These included the following:\"self-awareness,\" participants reported more symptoms when toldthey were taking an active drug with side effects if they were notfacing a mirror ( Gibbons et al., 1979 ); \"odors,\" more symptom reports following suggestion of symptoms if the odor was unpleas-ant ( Dalton, 1999 ); \"classical conditioning,\" higher total, respira- tory, cardiac, and unclassified symptom scores following exposureto an odor previously paired with CO2 if participants receivedsymptom suggestions ( Winters et al., 2003 ); and \"state anxiety,\" higher total and head/concentration symptoms following symptomsuggestions if participants had high anxiety ( Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ). Discussion Summary of Main Results From the 89 studies that met our inclusion criteria, 14 categories of risk factor for a nocebo effect were identified, including nineexperimentally induced risk factor categories and six baseline riskfactor categories (miscellaneous categories were present for bothexperimental and prospective studies). Of these categories, \"learn-ing/social be the strongest predictors of nocebo effects. Therewas some evidence for the role of \"personality\" in nocebo effects;however which facets of personality are more strongly linked withnocebo effects needs further research. In addition, although notstrong predictors on their own, learning/classical conditioning,likelihood suggestion, self-awareness, and negative affect consis-tently interacted with other risk factors. Given the proposed psychological mechanisms behind nocebo effects it is perhaps unsurprising that these factors have beenconsistently identified in the literature. Specifically looking at theexpectation mechanism, it is intuitive that verbal suggestions ofsymptoms can generate expectations of these effects leading tosymptom reporting. In support of this, participants' own baselineexpectations can trigger symptoms, while perceived dose presum-ably affects symptom reports through a mediating effect of expec-tations, with a higher dose associated in a participant's mind witha stronger effect. This could also explain the significance ofmedication brand, with branded medication being generally ex-pected by the public to be better quality than generic unbrandedmedication and therefore less likely to cause side effects ( Faasse et al., 2013 ). Expectations could also explain why four studies which measured symptom reports both for prewarned and nonwarnedsymptoms found stronger effects for symptoms that had previouslybeen suggested ( Faasse et al., 2013 ;Gibbons et al., 1979 ;Lorber et al., 2007 ;Mazzoni et al., 2010 ). It also explains why no effect was found for performance suggestions, as this should not directlyinfluence expectations of symptoms from the exposure. It is important not to overemphasize the nature of our results with respect to expectation, however. In particular, it was strikingthat type of administration and verbal suggestions of the likelihoodof exposure did not appear to be relevant despite both supposedlyraising expectations of symptoms. Possibly, the influence of thesefactors on expectations is weaker than might be thought. Alterna-tively, methodological factors may account for the lack of effect.For example, both studies assessing type of administration usedpatient samples ( Goldman et al., 1965 ;Kaptchuk et al., 2006 ). Given their greater experience with medical procedures, merelychanging an intervention from a pill to an injection may not havetriggered a substantial change in expectations. For three of thelikelihood suggestion studies ( Walach et al., 2001 ,2002 ;WalachThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.1348 WEBSTER, WEINMAN, AND RUBIN& Schneider, 2009 Exp 1) it was suggested that the absence of an effect could have been because of cultural differences, with thecaffeine effect stereotype not as strong in Germany as it is in theU.S.A. The overall support for the role of expectations identified in our review still allows for at least two \"submechanisms\" to exist. Thefirst is a role for attentional bias and symptom detection ( Hahn, 1997 ). The second is a more direct effect, where-by expectations affect emotional state ( Kirsch, 1997b ;Stewart-Williams, 2004 ). For example, Kirsch (1997b) pointed out that the expectation of anxiety is likely to be anxiety provoking, thereby directly causingthe outcome. This could explain the strong results seen for manip-ulating verbal suggestions of arousal on symptom reporting, as theexpectation of arousal or relaxation is itself likely to be arousing orrelaxing. However, there does need to be a degree of caution ininterpreting these results on arousal as they could be interpreted aspart of the placebo response. With regard to misattribution as a mechanism, the evidence from the studies that investigated self-awareness as a risk factordid not support this, with the two most directly relevant studies thatinstructed participants to monitor for any sensations failing to findan effect. Equally, for the six studies investigating the effect ofbaseline symptoms on symptom reporting the results were mixedproviding inconclusive support for misattribution. However, fivestudies ( Bogaerts et al., 2010 ;De Peuter al., 2005 ;Papoiu et al., 2011 ;Strohle, 2000 ;Szemerszky et al., 2010 ), showed that suf- fering from a condition with symptoms similar to those beinginduced was a predictor of symptom reporting. As such, althoughthe mechanism remains plausible, further evidence is required toclarify its importance. For the learning mechanism support was found from studies investigating the risk factor \"association,\" with the taste of decaf-feinated coffee being enough to elicit caffeine related symptoms(Flaten & Blumenthal, 1999 ;Mikalsen et al., 2001 ). For prior experience, the results were weak but this could have been attrib-utable to a lack of experience as this manipulation was typically aone off event. However, there was evidence for the role of socialobservation, with two of three studies showing a significant effect.In addition, support for learning was seen in the studies usingclassical conditioning, which involved a number of trials. Almosthalf of the studies showed that conditioning CO2 inhalation withany odor is enough to elicit symptoms to the odor itself, and areliable finding among the studies was that this was especially thecase if the odor was unpleasant. For baseline risk factors, we found no evidence of any effects of gender. However, since conducting the literature search, one ad-ditional study that would have met the inclusion criteria hasbecome apparent and which is relevant here. This study by Faasse, Grey, Jordan, Garland, and Petrie (2015) investigated the risk factor of observing a female confederate display symptoms, dem-onstrating a significant effect on symptom reporting in females. Itis interesting to note that Lorber et al. (2007) , who also studied social observation, also only found a significant effect in females. One possibility is that it may be something inherent to social obser-vation that makes females more vulnerable to nocebo effects. Other demographic factors such as age, employment status or level ofeducation were also not risk factors. Interestingly, anxiety did notcome out as a strong predictor despite the role it could playthrough misattribution (generating physical symptoms that areavailable to be misattributed) and expectations (apprehension of symptoms). One possible explanation for this advanced by Szem- erszky et al. (2010) is that scores of anxiety could reach a ceiling effect due to advance information about the risks of taking part inthe study. For other baseline risk factors, many different types ofpersonality were implicated such as: Type A personality ( Drici et al., 1995 ), lower positive affect, vigilance ( Nevelsteen et al., 2007 ), pessimism, motivation to cooperate, somatization, somato- sensory amplification, modern health worries ( Szemerszky et 2010 ;Witth\u00f6ft & Rubin, 2013 ), and neuroticism ( Davis et al., 1995 ). A lack of consistency in the personality traits studied makes it difficult to interpret these findings, but many would seem to fitwith expectation and/or misattribution mechanisms. Nocebo effects have occasionally been referred to as the 'evil twin' of placebo effects. If true, one would expect the risk factorsfor a nocebo effect to be the inverse of the risk factors for a placeboeffect. At a first look the mechanisms supported in our review doappear to be similar to those previously identified for placeboeffects, albeit acting in the opposite direction. For example, theexpectancy mechanism has been implicated for placebos throughfactors such as verbal suggestions, and participants' own baselineexpectations which lead to positive expectations for pain or symp-tom relief ( Benedetti et al., 2003 ;Kam-Hansen et al., 2014 ;Price et al., 1999 ;Vits et al., 2013 ). In addition, learning mechanisms such as prior experience of pain relief, social observation, orconditioning people to experience pain relief results in subsequentplacebo responses ( Colloca & Benedetti, 2006 ,2009 ;Suchman & Ader, 1992 ). It also seems that opposite personality characteristics also predict placebo responding for example, optimism ( Geers, Kosbab, Helfer, Weiland, & Wellman, 2007 ) as opposed to pes- simism. One notable exception, however, would be the misattri-bution of preexisting symptoms, as logically this can only berelevant for nocebo: one cannot misattribute the absence of pre-existing symptoms to an exposure. However, it is possible onecould misattribute and fixate on a coincidental decline in symp-toms after taking a sham tablet, and misattribute their improvedwellbeing to the tablet. Quality of Original Research It is possible that some of our conclusions may be attributable to differences in quality between those studies that found an effectand those that did not. We did not observe any clear trend for lowerquality studies to report more or fewer significant results thanhigher quality studies. However, on the whole the quality of thestudies included in this review was limited because of poor report-ing of key issues in experimental research such as randomization,allocation concealment, blinding, and not registering a study pro-tocol before initiating recruitment. Prospective studies had fewerquality concerns, however given that experimental studies allowthe control of more variables the results of these have moreweighting than those from the prospective studies. It is also worthnoting that almost half of studies did not mention receiving ethicalapproval. In an area of research requiring deception, or at leastwithholding information to deliberately cause symptoms, this issurprising. There is scope for future researchers to improve themethodological rigor of this field. Another surprising limitation ofmany of the studies included in this review was the lack of a priorisample size calculations.

As such, we could not assess the quality ofstudies based on their sample size in the large majority cases.Although it would have been useful to score each study for theirstrength of evidence, because of this lack of clear reporting and theheterogeneity across studies it was too hard to quantify the strengthof each study using the same scale. Quality of This Review A strength of this review is that we did not include studies in which participants were exposed to an active exposure capable ofeliciting symptoms through physiological mechanisms (e.g., ex-periments altering the information given to participants about agenuine medication). Such studies do not assess the pure noceboeffect, described as the undesirable effects experienced from aninert exposure ( Kennedy, 1961 ) and can prove more difficult to interpret ( Neukirch & Colagiuri, 2015 ). Our search resulted in a large number of results. As the term 'nocebo' is still not widely used and may be preferentially used bythose studies identifying a significant increase in symptoms intheir participants, we deliberately adopted a broader search strat-egy than that used in previous reviews, for example, Petersen et al. (2014) . Despite this, it is not certain that every study that met the inclusion criteria has been included, especially as nearly a quarterof included studies were identified through personal contacts. Thisinconsistent use of terminology makes the nocebo literature diffi-cult to search and will continue to limit reviews in this area. Wecould have included terms such as 'adverse effects or negativeoutcome' in the search strategy but the number of results would beunmanageable as it would include many clinical trials that wouldnot meet our inclusion criteria. On Medline alone, such searchterms return over 97,000 results. This is also one of the reasonswhy we did not simply use 'placebo' as one of the search terms\u2014every study which described itself as \"placebo-controlled\" wouldbe returned. In addition to limitations resulting from our search strategy, it is possible that some studies could have been falsely rejected aftertitle and abstract screening (e.g., the main purpose of the studymay have been on the placebo effect and therefore only placeboand not nocebo findings were reported in the abstract). We suspectthat this is unlikely to have occurred often, however. In order tohave been included such studies would have had to (a) manipu-lated factor(s) to affect nocebo responding or (b) looked at baselinemeasures as predictors of nocebo responding, which many do notdo. Many studies which looked at the placebo effect passedthrough abstract screening as they mentioned participants experi-encing negative symptoms or patients feeling worse after placeboexposure. However, going through the full manuscript the majorityof these studies would not explore the possible reasons why, forexample, baseline predictors. Therefore we feel this is not some-thing to be too concerned about. In addition studies published in non-European languages may have been less likely to have been identified as well as studies thatwere not reported in the conventional peer-reviewed literature. Other limitations of the review reflect the way we grouped the results. We aggregated studies based on the independent variable.Because of this and because there are no direct replications eachrisk factor grouping contains several different outcomes. It is possible that an interaction exists between independent and depen-dent variables: for example, some outcomes may be more suscep-tible to the effects of changes in expectations than others. Unfor-tunately, we did not have enough data to explore this in depth. Similarly as this review focused on identifying all the possible risk factors of nocebo effects that have been investigated in theliterature, we included studies with different research populations,for example, students, healthy volunteers and patients. As suchthere could be differences between the groups in terms of whichmechanisms are more likely to be at play. For example, it is likelythe misattribution mechanism is more important for the develop-ment of nocebo effects in patient samples than healthy volunteers.However, looking at studies that had a patient sample we shouldinterpret the results of those that just focused on baseline diseasemeasures as support of the misattribution mechanism with caution.These studies did not measure actual baseline symptoms or emo-tions which are more likely to be subject to the misattributionmechanism, rather than disease status. Finally, the interaction between the mechanisms, outcomes, and mode of delivery may also be important, but could not be exploredin detail given the data available to us. For example, differentforms of sham intervention for example, sham tablets versus shamcaffeine versus sham EMF, may be more or less likely to triggercertain psychological mechanisms, and be more or less likely toaffect certain outcomes, see Szemerszky, D\u00f6m\u00f6t\u00f6r, Berkes, and K\u00f6teles (2016) . Implications for Clinical Practice and Research Our results suggest clinicians keen to reduce side effects in- duced by any nocebo effect associated with their interventionscould (a) identify patient expectations of the adverse effects of anintervention and provide reassurance if these seem excessive, (b)avoid giving suggestions of side effects associated with the inter-vention, (c) down-play the dose that is being provided, and (d)reduce patient exposure to other patients experiencing side effects.Wells and Kaptchuk (2012) suggest the use of contextualized informed consent, whereby doctors should identify high-risk pa-tients and tailor the medication side effect information so that thesepatients only receive drug specific side effect information, whichis less susceptible to the nocebo response. Our review supports thisand suggests that such tailoring may be especially required forthose who have at-risk personality types. Clearly, these sugges-tions also have a downside, however, as they reduce informedconsent and patient autonomy by restricting the information that isbeing provided. Alternative ways to reduce nocebo effects while maintaining the ability of a patient to give full informed consentare required. There is scope for researchers to develop innovativeways to reduce nocebo effects that does not require withholding ofinformation. This has been shown by Crichton and Petrie (2015) , who found that informing participants about nocebo effects effec-tively reduced symptoms to infrasound noise. In addition Bingel and the Placebo Competence Team (2014) provides some sugges- tions on how to avoid nocebo effects which are supported by thisreview such as improving the communication in patient informa-tion leaflets to make them more patient-orientated and reducenegative expectations of potential adverse effects.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

It would also beadvisable to look again at the risk factor 'type of administration' ina healthy volunteer sample and to assess this manipulation onexpectations to explore possible mechanisms. It is also time forauthors to use consistent terminology allowing easier identificationof papers, and to enhance the quality of their research in this area.Simple acts such as being more explicit about randomization andblinding procedures and publishing protocols will enhance thetransparency of the research in this area while also helping toalleviate some of the controversy surrounding nocebo research. Conclusions This review found that there is a mix of factors which predict whether someone will experience a nocebo effect. Given theimplications nocebo effects have on patients' quality of life and thehealth costs they create, it is important for research to start devel-oping interventions to prevent nocebo effects from occurring whilestill trying to uphold informed consent. This systematic reviewprovides a useful starting point for researchers to develop evi-denced based interventions designed to negate nocebo effects,while also highlighting areas that need further investigation andimprovement.
