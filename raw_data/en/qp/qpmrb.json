All Rights Reserved. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 4A Message from our Current President: Kelly Holland Azzaro Dear NAHA Members, I am always fascinated to hear how people heard about NAHA, or who referred a new member to join NAHA. My NAHA story and how I was turned-on to joining the organization, is this: Back in the end of the 1990's, I attended Sylla Sheppard- Hanger's aromatherapy prac- titioner course. During class break time, she told the students about NAHA and handed out membership applications and also shared some NAHA Journals for us to look through. My immediate thought and what I blurted out was, \"There is an aromatherapy association? Oh my gosh, I must join right away!\" Sylla inspired us all to join NAHA, and I've been a devoted Member of NAHA ever since. Not long after joining, I became a Regional Director because I wanted to give more to NAHA, an organization that shared my beliefs and passion for True Aromatherapy. I attended several of the NAHA conferences and expos and met many wonderful people, as well as getting to know the past Board members and volunteers. At the NAHA Conference in Virginia, I was encouraged to participate in the coming election. I was elected Vice President and began to form the new NAHA Board, along with Michele Miller, who became President. NAHA was in need of support and help and I wanted to do my best to deliver this. My time on that Board proved to be a great learning experience on many levels. One of the main issues in the feedback I constantly heard from members was the need for more communication between NAHA and its members. To me, this is the life-line for any organization: an open, timely, responsive line of communication and support. From day one, my main focus for NAHA was to create an aromatic network and an open line of communication for the NAHA Members. I spent a lot of time and energy on grassroots style communications with past and current members to rebuild bridges. I hoped to inspire others to join NAHA, and to have them also support NAHA. Having a connection with Members, Schools and Regional Directors is an invaluable resource for the continued growth of the organization. It creates an environment that allows everyone to participate in helping NAHA grow, and it supports the efforts of the Members in sharing true aromatherapy with others. When the current President had to resign for personal issues, the NAHA office relocated here to North Carolina and I became President. With the support of my husband, Marco, we dedicated and committed ourselves to taking on and winning this life-changing challenge. With Marco as the NAHA Office Administrator, the office was reorganized and set up to function in a professional manner which allowed us to reconnect with the members and start moving forward on new projects and membership benefits. Some of these new benefits include: monthly NAHA teleconferences, monthly e-newsletter, e-booklets, member only group site, membership logo, new aromatherapy brochures and new discounted professional and product liability insurance options. My goal as the NAHA President was to continue to inspire others about NAHA, all along while reorganizing the office and rebuilding membership. In order to reach my goal of inspiring others and rebuilding memberships, help and support from others was needed. My good friend and fellow Regional Director, former Board Secretary and Director Coordinator, Shellie Enteen, joined me as the new Vice President. Shellie has been an anchor of strong support and she devoted her time and energy to helping with the many tasks and projects that NAHA had on its plate. Working as a team we accomplished a lot after the relocation, including the huge but necessary task of completing the past due 2009 NAHA Aromatherapy Journals. With the assistance of Robyn Harden for design and layout, we did this within a three month turn-around time, all the while planning and collecting content for the future 2010-2012 journals. In order to keep our advertisers happy, we needed to get our journals out on time and we have done that consistently. Continued...page 5\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 5Continued...page 4 Our team support grew stronger when Annette Davis (NAHA Director Coordinator) and Jennifer Hochell Pressimone (NAHA Public Relations), and Sharon Falsetto (Secretary) became a part of the NAHA Board. In our first year we doubled membership. By the third year, membership had tripled. These talented and lovely ladies are very giving, supportive and professional and have contributed to helping NAHA to grow in a positive and productive way. I am happy that Annette, Jennifer and Sharon will continue as future NAHA Board Members. It is a blessing to the aromatherapy community and I know they have a lot to offer to the organization and the NAHA Membership. I also am so proud and grateful to all the NAHA Regional Directors. Our Board was excited when we were able to increase the number and scope of the NAHA Directorship. We supported them with tools to help build and update the NAHA Membership in their areas. Under the guidance of NAHA Director Coordinator, Annette Davis, we began monthly Director Meetings and communications to keep the Directors updated on members in their area. The Directors also participate by hosting their own NAHA Meetings, sharing information about NAHA and aromatherapy at their classes and events, and help with the answering the many inquiries received by the NAHA office. We are all also grateful to NAHA Safety Chair: Sylla Sheppard Hanger, for her dedication to the safe use of essential oils. Sylla volunteers her time and energy to respond to the many aromatherapy inquiries about how to use essential oils safely, contraindications, and of course the tireless communications about unsafe techniques and the inaccurate information that is found on the internet and via social media. We spent a lot of time updating the NAHA website. It now comes up in the top ten searches and receives thousands of visitors. Through the website, the office gets regular inquiries from non-members and those seeking information on aromatherapy education, essential oil safety, membership information, and etc. The organization is such a valuable resource to both members and non-members. Awareness for aromatherapy is increasing and more and more people are seeking education and information. It's great to know that NAHA is there to help others on their aromatherapy journey. And so, as this part of my NAHA journey is nearing an end, it is also time for new beginnings and moving forward. I am pleased and excited when I imagine the ways the new NAHA Board and Regional Directors will continue to add to the growth and support of NAHA through their own unique talents, their time and energy. With projects and goals for building a new NAHA website and Membership Directory, NAHA will continue to grow and be a strong and devoted voice for True Aromatherapy! Marco and I have been blessed and are grateful to have been a big part of the NAHA journey and success. We will always support the organization and fellow members. Aromatherapy is our passion and we are happy that we have inspired and assisted others to become part of this wonderful organization. Aromatic Blessings to you all, Kelly Holland Azzaro, RA, CCAP, LMTCurrent President, NAHA (Please Note: The NAHA office will relocate with the new Board and new Office Administrator. The office move is scheduled to take place before the end of this year. You will receive notice of the new address and contact information, and check the NAHA website for updates.) A Message from our Current President: Kelly Holland Azzaro pppp )\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 6A from our Current Vice President: Shellie Enteen Dear NAHA Members, In 2003, I had been a NAHA member for only four years, but had been in the position of Southeast Florida Regional Director for three of those. As older and returning members know, at that time NAHA was in crisis, a scheduled conference in Norfolk, VA, floundering with no direction. Past President Cheryl Hoard asked me to come on the Board. I accepted and began working with an in- credible team of dedicated and passionate aroma- therapists to make that Conference a success and to keep the NAHA boat afloat. I couldn't say 'no' to Cheryl and 9 years later, I am very glad I didn't. I've been on the Board since then, working in different capacities: Secretary, Director Coordinator, and for the past three years, Vice President. I am truly proud of the way NAHA has grown in that time and the well deserved respect it has earned in the professional Aromatherapy community both in the US and internationally. In 2003, I also met Kelly Holland Azzaro. We became good friends and fellow Board Members and when she became President, I accepted her invitation to be her Vice President. As I knew she would, Kelly worked tirelessly to create the organization as it is today: responsive to members, on time with journals. With office manager, Marco Azzaro's wonderful assistance, Kelly was able to bring NAHA into the technological and social media age with online member chat groups, e-newsletters and e-journals of very high quality, creating e-books on important topics and so much more. I have been her support, her collaborator and have been responsible for editing all the written material produced. As a writer, that's another of my passions. During this Administration, NAHA has attracted a group of outstanding Regional Directors to support the Board. They contribute so much to the members, not only through writing articles and giving teleconferences but also with their commitment to the NAHA principles of true aromatherapy. I want to thank them all and our current Director Coordinator, Annette Davis, for keeping the energy connected and high, and for promoting NAHA at their own events and other events they attend. Now it's time to pass the NAHA baton to another group. I'm happy to know they are inheriting a wonderful and well functioning organization. I am sure they are dedicated to maintaining and strengthening NAHA and creating even more member resources. And I can shift my focus back to my personal projects and interests, happy to have been a part of a job well done. In leaving, I'd like to say that it is increasingly difficult today to counter the inaccurate and even dangerous information about aromatherapy that can be found through online articles and the advertising agendas of certain companies. The business itself faces issues of endangered oils, sustainable harvesting, and attempts at legislation that would deny our access to these precious substances. It is through professional organizations like NAHA that the truth can be found and the line can be held. As members, please know that your volunteer group of Board Members and Directors work hard and devote many hours to upholding our purpose of educating the public. And they need your support, too. The more you share NAHA, the more our organization grows, and with it, the message of True Aromatherapy. Many blessings to you all, Shellie Enteen, RA, BA, LMTCurrent VP, NAHA \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 7The Effect of Scent on Emotionally Disturbed Children Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, LPC, RA The information in this paper is purely anecdotal and in no way provides scientific study or conclusions. The names of individuals included within this text have also been changed for purposes of confidentiality. As a Mental Health Therapist in a residential treatment facility I had the opportunity to make several observa-tions regarding the effect of scent on children. The residential treatment facility treats children between the ages of six and eighteen years of age. It is a facil-ity that helps the children of neglect and abuse, and their families, learn new methods of responding to their environment and situations. The children are often diagnosed with such conditions as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Depressive Disorders, Borderline Personality Disorder/Traits, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Anxiety Disor-ders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), eating disorders, and anger. It was work I loved and learned from daily. I worked in the facility for a total of fifteen years. One of the observations that continually struck me was the effect scent has on children. As Mental Health Therapists, scent is something we don't usually consider when treating children. We focus on the emotional and behavioral reactions children have to tones of voice, facial expression, environment, sound, and situation, not scent. However, scent is the one sense that creates the strongest and most enduring memories, so why do we overlook this significant factor?When teaching new on-line staff members, those individuals working on the living unit with the children on a daily basis, I often cautioned them on the amount of cologne or perfume they chose to wear. I strongly suggested they wear no cologne or perfume. This caution was often met with questioning looks. I would explain that certain aromas trigger specific memories. I would demonstrate this by asking them to close their eyes and think of how their grandmother's home smelled. Several people would smile, nod their heads, and have a look of pleasure on their faces. When ques-tioned about the experience, many individuals would state they actually had the scents or aromas of their grandmother's home in their nostrils! This exercise would emphasize the strength of olfactory memory, and how children can be affected by a particular scent. Once staff members understood the power of scent on memory their understanding of how scent can trigger negative memories for children was easily grasped. I would explain that some children may respond to the scent of cologne or perfume in a negative manner. To further illustrate, I told the following story: \"Johnny\" was a bright, energetic eight year old that came from a home where he was continually physi-cally, sexually, mentally, and emotionally abused by his father. Johnny lived in continual anxiety and fear, not knowing what each minute would bring. His father wore the same cologne in an overabundance, or he reeked of stale body odor. It was these aromas Johnny began to associate with his father, and with abuse and fear, causing a \"fight, flight, or freeze\" response. When Johnny came to the treatment facility he gradu- ally began to trust adults and learned how to live with much less fear. It was magic to watch this once terri-fied little boy begin to smile, laugh, and discover a life without abuse. Initially Johnny would only work with the women. But in time he began to tentatively work with the men who worked in his living unit and school the problems began. Continued...page 8 \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 8The Effect of Scent on Emotionally Disturbed Children Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, LPC, RA Continued...page 9Continued...page 7 Johnny began having periods of time when he would completely shut down, not talk, not follow simple instructions, and refuse to come out of his bedroom and interact with others. Gradually the problems grew to catastrophic proportions. Johnny began having severe temper outbursts where he would hit, kick, bite, scream, and head butt others. These episodes always resulted in Johnny requiring a physical hold to prevent him from hurting himself and others, and sometimes the need for a locked seclusion room was required to prevent Johnny from destroying property. This change in Johnny was baffling at first. Then one day during a staffing where each child's progress is discussed with the on line staff, supervisors, and therapist, it became evident to me that one of the male staff members was wearing cologne and it was applied quite heavily. It then dawned on me that Johnny's behavior might be linked to the scent of the cologne, which was the same as the one Johnny's father wore. Records and logs were reviewed and it became clear that nearly every time Johnny had an episode this particular male staff member, who always wore the cologne, was working. It was suggested that for the next two weeks the staff member not wear cologne and observe how Johnny responded. During the first few days of this experiment Johnny refrained from going near the staff member, but slowly he began to work with the man, and no episodes of temper occurred. It seems so very simple that by asking the staff member to not wear cologne a child could func-tion without fear and anger but truly, in this case, it was that simple. Over the years I accumulated numerous stories just like this one and it hit home how strong the affects of scent on children actually are. Science has shown the amygdala, a small gland in the brain, \"plays a major role in storing and releasing emo- tional trauma. The most effective way to stimulate this gland is with fragrance or smell in order to awaken and release these memories for healing.\"\u00b9 Johnny's story illustrates how the fragrance of a specific cologne \"reawakened\" Johnny's traumatic memories, and how by removing that particular fragrance from his environ-ment healing was able to occur. As my interest in aromatherapy grew I began to notice how other scents and aromas affected not only me, but the children. Often the administrative assistants would burn strongly scented waxes in their candle warmers or use room sprays, both of which could be easily detected in the hallways of the facility. Often the scents were pleasing, but sometimes they would be overwhelming. The most powerful was the aroma of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum). When too much cinnamon is used it burns my nasal passages, makes my eyes water, and can trigger an asthma attack. These physiological sensations lead to an emotional response of heightened anxiety in me. I observed a similar response in the children as well. Although very few of the children responded with the same physical responses I had they did become more agitated, less able to focus, and more physically active when confronted with the scent of cinnamon. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 9The Effect of Scent on Emotionally Disturbed Children Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, LPC, RA Continued...page 10Continued...page 8 This may be due to the stimulating effects of cinnamon alone, and given that many of the children are diag- nosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), it makes sense that cinnamon would result in the behavior observed. It appears the children were over stimulated by the aroma of cinnamon. During a period of academic testing in the on-grounds school of the facility one of the elementary school teachers began diffusing peppermint (Mentha piperita) oil in her classroom. The teacher read an article about the effects of peppermint on the mind and was eager to see if peppermint would help her classroom, full of very young children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. It was this teacher's hope that by diffusing peppermint oil she would aid her students' ability to focus, learn, retain, and apply the skills she was teaching. Valerie Gennari Cooksley, RN, mentions in her book, Aromatherapy Soothing Remedies to Restore, Rejuvenate, and Heal, that peppermint essential oil improves alertness and the ability to concentrate. Prior to the actual academic testing, the teacher noted that the children were having difficulty retaining much of the information she was teaching. She found that after she began diffusing peppermint oil in the class-room the children's ability to remember vital informa-tion showed improvement. As an additional benefit, the teacher noticed the children were less physically hyperactive, more willing and eager to learn, and gen-erally much better students. Although this was not a scientific study the positive effects peppermint had on the learning and attention of this particular group of children bore out Patricia Davis' assertion in her book, Aromatherapy An A-Z: \"Peppermint is one of the oils described as 'celphalic', that is, it stimulates the brain and aids clear thinking (Rosemary and Basil are others.) Any of these oils will physically clear the head, leaving the user feeling fresh and bright and ready for mental effort.\" Although vanilla (Vanilla planifolia) is not typically used in aromatherapy, the aroma of vanilla proved to have a positive effect on the younger children as well. When six to ten boys between the ages of six and ten years old, all diagnosed with ADHD, live in the same living unit it can be quite chaotic to say the least. Bed time can be problematic with this population due to several factors: ADHD, Post-traumatic Stress Disor-der (PTSD), defiance, or simply just because the child is not sleepy. Occasionally there are periods of time when getting the boys to bed can become a struggle, and during one such period an astute staff person thought of using vanilla scented room spray to help calm the boys down. As the allotted bed time approached, the staff person would enter each child's room and spray the room once with the vanilla scented room spray. Also, one half-hour prior to bed time, the vanilla room spray would be dispersed in the living room area of the living unit. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 10The Effect of Scent on Emotionally Disturbed Children Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, LPC, RA Continued...page 11Continued...page 9 Additional measures were also utilized to help calm the boys, such as dimming the lights, reading a bed time story, and tucking them into bed. After these measures were employed for approximately one week the boys began asking for the room spray over the dimming of the lights and the bed time story. When questioned about their preference for the vanilla room spray over the other options all the boys stated they liked the smell, it helped them relax, and they thought they slept better. Many of the children on my caseload were young girls in their teenage years, many diagnosed with a depres-sive disorder and/or Borderline Personality Disorder/Traits. These girls were usually highly emo-tional and volatile. Extreme displays of emotion, often tears accompanied by loud sobs or screaming, were commonplace during a therapy session and through-out the entire day. These episodes are draining, emo-tionally, mentally, and physically, on the girls and on the staff members, teachers, and therapists. It was by pure accident I discovered the effects of sandalwood (Santalum album)* oil in combating the extreme emotional volatility of therapy sessions with this population of girls. I have used sandalwood oil as a personal perfume for years because of its calming effects. Even a mental health therapist needs assis-tance in remaining calm in the face of so much emo- tional and behavioral upheaval. During a period of extreme stress at work I began diffusing sandalwood in my office as an added boost to the sandalwood oil I applied each morning. I soon discovered that the stressors of work did not affect me as profoundly as they had before I started using sandalwood in the diffuser. I also noted the girls on my caseload began having more productive, less emotionally charged therapy sessions. Not only was the sandalwood oil having a positive effect on my emotional state, it was also assisting the girls in their emotional regulation. I found that therapy sessions that focused on past abuse or past negative behavior were met with less demonstrative displays of fear, anxiety, and depres-sive emotion. These difficult therapy sessions became less so because the calming, sedative effects of the sandalwood were at work. Valerie Gennari Cooksley noted that sandalwood in a blend assists in helping relieve feelings of anxiety, depression and tearfulness. This proved to be true with the girls on my caseload when sandalwood was diffused in my office during their therapy sessions. It was amazing to note the progress the girls made in therapy because they were able to focus and address difficult issues without the hindrance of dealing with high levels of emotion. It was at this time in my career I began to diligently explore the area of aromatherapy. My initial explora-tion into aromatherapy was to help with my own physi-cal symptoms of Fibromyalgia compounded by a bout with West Nile Virus. However, I quickly began to note the emotional benefits of essential oils, and how those benefits could assist me in my professional work. Ber-gamot (Citrus bergamia) oil was one that intrigued me because of its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antide-pressant, antiseptic, and expectorant properties, not to mention that the aroma is divine. At this same time I had one young woman on my caseload, \"Tess,\" who was a victim of sexual abuse perpetrated by a close family friend. Tess suffered from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, and anxiety. Prior to her admission to the treatment facility Tess was refusing to attend school because she was so debilitated by her symptoms. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 11The Effect of Scent on Emotionally Disturbed Children Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, LPC, RA Continued...page 12Continued...page 10 Tess entered each therapy session with trepidation and extreme tearfulness. Tess was very willing to discuss her abuse, her feelings toward her abuser and her family, but she would quickly become so over-whelmed with feelings of sadness, self-blame, and hopelessness she would dissolve into gut wrenching bouts of sobbing. Tess's progress in therapy was at a standstill for several weeks because she could not regulate her negative emotions enough to process them. A solution to the impasse had to be found. Ber-gamot essential oil proved to be very emotionally uplifting for me, so I thought I would try it with Tess during her upcoming therapy sessions. Tess's next therapy session began as it had in the past, with anxiety, fear, and tearfulness. But before the session began in earnest I said that with her permis-sion, I wanted to try something new. I told Tess that I simply wanted to diffuse bergamot oil in the office during her sessions because I thought she might like the aroma. I didn't want to create an expectation for Tess that the oil would \"cure\" her anxiety and depres-sion. Immediately Tess commented on the wonderful smell and how much she enjoyed it. For the next few therapy sessions, Tess's emotional reactions were similar to what they had been prior to the use of berga-mot. However, I began to notice a marked decrease in her level of anxiety and tearfulness during her sessions. Tess noted her improvement as well, and when asked what it was she thought contributed to her ability to be less emotionally charged during therapy, Tess said she felt relaxed, more \"smiley,\" and less sad whenever she entered my office. I told her that my request to diffuse the bergamot oil during her therapy sessions was to use aromatherapy to assist her thera-peutic process. At this time I also explained aroma- therapy and the known benefits of bergamot essential oil. I read the following passage from Patricia Davis's book: \"In helping with mental and psychological states, bergamot is almost the most valuable oil at the aromatherapist's disposal.\" Tess was pleasantly sur- prised by the information, but she made one request. She asked if she could attempt her next few therapy sessions without bergamot oil to see if she had progressed through her issues enough to not need theadditional benefits of the oil. Tess's next therapy sessions were difficult, and she did demonstrate her emotions through tearfulness, but she was able to work through the issues. Occasionally Tess would request that bergamot be diffused in the office, espe-cially if she wanted to tackle a particularly difficult issue, but eventually Tess no longer needed the addi- tional assistance of bergamot oil for her sessions. Eight months after Tess entered the treatment facility and my office, she was successfully discharged to her parent's home. At the time of her discharge, Tess approached me and said, \"Haly, thank you. I will always remember bergamot. I am going to try and get some of my own and whenever I am feeling sad or afraid I will open it up and smell it. And know what else? I'll think of you, too.\" A search on PubMed produces hundreds of studies which provide information regarding the amygdala's role in the formation of memory, especially memories associated with fear. However, not one study cites the potential for aromatherapy in the process of healing, or effectively addressing traumatic memory. As illus- trated in the story about Johnny, and even more so in the story about Tess, aroma and aromatherapy can be an effective tool for a therapist to utilize in the business of awakening and processing past trauma for a client. It is the hope of the author that aromatherapy will be done in working with children in the future, especially children with emotional and/or behavioral difficulties, because the benefits are limitless. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 12The Effect of Scent on Emotionally Disturbed Children Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, LPC, RA Continued...page 11 *As Santalum album is endangered essential oil, according to Battaglia, Australian sandalwood can be used for the same subtle effects as described in this article. Author's Note: It was after the period when I was working as a mental health therapist that sandalwood (Santalum album) was designated an endangered essential oil. Since then, I have quit using Santalum album and now use wild Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) and feel I achieve the same or similar desired effects with this substitution. I advise the reader to do the same. Haly is a formally trained Clinical Aromatherapist who received the bulk of her training from Shanti Dechen at Aroma Apothecary Heal- ing Art Academy. Haly specializes in individu- alized therapeutic blending to assist clients with physi- cal, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. In conjunction with her aromatherapy skills, Haly also uses her skills as a mental health therapist to assist each client to gain a healthy balance and regulate and maintain overall health. Prior to becoming an aromatherapist, Haly was a psychotherapist and clinical case manager at a residential treatment facility for children. Haly has also been an adoption therapist and taught college level psychology courses. In her work at the residential treatment facility, Haly helped children and their fami- lies overcome severe emotional and behavioral disruptions. It was through the use of diffusing essen-tial oils in her office that Haly became more and more interested in the practice of aromatherapy. This inter-est resulted in Haly leaving her active mental health therapy practice and pursuing her education in aromatherapy. Haly lives in a small town in Wyoming with her husband and three active terriers. To learn more about Haly, please visit her 2010.

Lunny, MD, RA, MDMA, FIFA This article will look at the characteristics present in childhood ADHA and their management with clinical aromatherapy. Aromatherapy for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) presenting as hyperactivity, distractibility, and/or impulsiveness. Children and adolescents with this disorder might have one, two, or all three of these behaviours. Hyperactivity refers to an increased activity level, often reflected in fidgety behaviour. Distractibility refers to an inability to block out unimportant stimuli in the environment, resulting in a short attention span. For some, the problem is with auditory peripheral stimuli, for others visual, and for some, both. Impulsiveness refers to an inability to stop and think before one speaks and/or acts. ADHD is most frequently found in children and adolescents. However, it may continue into adulthood in anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of cases. Current research strongly suggests that ADHD is caused by a deficiency of norepinephrine in the ascending reticular activating system. Allopathic treatment, as will be discussed later, uses medication to increase the production of this neurotransmitter in combination with other therapeutic, educational, and/or behavioural interventions, as appropriate. Diagnosing ADHD To get an ADHD diagnosis, the history must be \"chronic,\" showing that the difficulties have been present for most or all of the individual's life. They must also be \"pervasive,\" with symptoms that are observable in any setting or situation that demands sustained attention. One must differentiate ADHD from an emotional problem that might result from anxiety and/or depression. Such emotional conditions can produce behaviours of hyperactivity, distractibility, and/or impulsiveness. There are also certain types of learning disabilities and language disabilities that can result in behaviours suggestive of distractibility and a short attention span. These disorders must also be ruled out in establishing the diagnosis of ADHD. Many children and adolescents with ADHD are not identified and treated. They become frustrated, have difficulty coping with stress, and may act out behaviourally. They may present clinically as having disruptive behavioural disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder. It is critical for the clinician to determine if the presenting disruptive behavioural disorder is the primary diagnosis or if it is secondary to an underlying ADHD. If ADHD is the underlying cause, it must be diagnosed and treated in order to successfully treat the secondary disruptive behavioural disorder. There are psychopharmacologic medications avail- able for treating ADHD. There is a group of medications that work by increasing the availability of norepinephrine in the reticular activating system. With the proper medication and dosage, most individuals with ADHD show significant improvement. Behaviour management techniques, family and individual treatment, and educational interventions ranging from classroom modifications to self contained special education settings are also needed to ensure a successful outcome.

The most beneficial methods of aromatherapy treatment are tepid immersion baths, room humidifiers and cold air ionic diffusers. The choice of essential oils will depend on individual circumstances, but the oils should be chosen for the following properties: febrifuge, calming, relaxing, concentration enhancing and uplifting. Very effective blends that have been invaluable for the treatment of younger children are: 3 drops lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) 2 drops (Citrus hystrix petitgrain) melissa (Melissa officinalis) drops myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) 3 drops vetiver (Vetiveria zisanoides) 2 drops bergamot (Citrus bergamia) 2 drops sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) Three drops of this essential oil blend can then be used in a bath oil diluted as 1.5% in sweet almond oil (Prunus amigdalus) or in rosehip seed oil (Rosa rubiginosa). The same blend of essential oils may be used undiluted in an aroma lamp or room diffuser, allowing it to slowly release into the child's classroom or at home. Another useful environmental tip is to have the room decorated with pastel pinks and lemon-yellow colors which were found for many years to calm the children and make them concentrate and enjoy themselves without being disruptive. Although this article focuses on children's diseases, I feel that it is important to address ADHD in adults, too, since this is very often totally ignored. ADHD in AdultsThey may have difficulty following directions, remembering information, concentrating, organizing tasks or completing work within time limits. If these difficulties are not managed appropriately they can cause associated behavioural, emotional, social, vocational and academic problems. Adult ADHD Statistics:ADHD afflicts approximately 3% to 10% of school-aged children and an estimated 60% of those will maintain the disorder in adulthood. Prevalence rates for ADHD in adults are not as well determined as rates for children, but fall in the 4% to 5% range.ADHD affects males at higher rate than females in childhood but this ratio seems to even out by adulthood. Common Behaviours and Problems of Adult ADHD The following behaviours and problems may stem directly from ADHD or may be the result of related adjustment difficulties: Continued...page 16 \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved Aromatherapeutic Management of Childhood ADHD Dr. Vivian N. Lunny, RA, MDMA, FIFA Continued...page 15 Chronic lateness and forgetfulness Anxiety Low self-esteem Employment problems Difficulty controlling anger Impulsiveness Substance abuse or addiction Poor organization skills Procrastination Low frustration tolerance Chronic boredom Difficulty concentrating when reading Mood swings Depression Relationship problems These behaviours may be mild to severe and can vary with the situation or be present all of the time. Some adults with ADHD may be able to concentrate if they are interested in or excited about what they are doing. Others may have difficulty focusing under any circumstances. Some look for stimulation, others avoid it. In addition, adults with ADHD can be withdrawn and antisocial, or they can be overly social and unable to be alone. School-Related Impairments Linked to Adult ADHD Adults with ADHD may have: Had a history of poorer educational performance and were underachievers. Had more frequent school disciplinary actions. Had to repeat a grade. Dropped out of school. Work-Related Impairments Linked to Adult ADHD Change employers frequently and perform poorly. Have had fewer occupational achievements, ind- ependent of psychiatric status. Social-Related Impairments Linked to Adult ADHD Have a lower socioeconomic status. Have driving violations such as: cited for speeding, licenses suspended, involved in more crashes, rate themselves and others as using poor driving habits. Use illegal substances more frequently. Smoke cigarettes. Self-report psychological maladjustment more often. Aromatherapy Management for Adult ADHD The management should be very individually focused and the blend of essential oils chosen and compounded accordingly, as will be the methods used. Hence, I am not giving sample blends in this article. Dr. Vivian N.

Note: This article is intended as an educational tool only. It is not meant to replace the guidance of a health care professional when needed. EDITOR'S NOTE: Although this article is a theme issue on using aromatherapy for children, some issues from infancy have an affect on adults. We included Dr. Berkowsky's article on how to treat anxiety and neuroses in adults that were generated by the birth trauma since there is a relationship to this theme. Please understand that we are not suggesting the use of highly irritating essential oils on the skin of children, even though very highly diluted in the Spiritual Phyotessencing Method. Please contact Dr. Berkowsky with any questions about using this method. Review of Part I Otto Rank and the Trauma of Birth Part I of this article began with a discussion of psychoanalyst Otto Rank's hypothesis, framed in his book The Trauma Of Birth (1924), that the anxiety experienced during birth was the template for all successive anxiety experienced during the course of one's life. Rank postulated that a child's separation from the mother at birth, and subsequently once again via weaning, is the platform upon which neuroses of all kinds are constructed. For Rank the very \"nucleus of the unconscious mind\" was the birth experience, during which an infant passes from a state of contented union with the mother to a violent dissolution of that union. Accordingly, a person's struggles to compensate for the traumatic, anxiety-filled, experience of birth, and avoid similar experiences, contributes mightily to the character of one's post-natal inventory of fears, anxiety and other neuroses. One of the most important concepts that I take away from Rank's ideas is that the trauma of that initial separation from the mother sets up a deep-seated fear, ingrained into both psycho-spiritual and physical memory regarding the urgent need to avoid future experiences of separation such as leaving the birth family, moving away from one's hometown, divorce, etc. Thus, when analyzing a case study for the purpose of preparing a custom essential oil blend for someone, it is crucial to determine the relative activity of the theme of separation in that person's life.The Kabbalah and the Theme of Separation The theme of separation is also a highly prominent one in the Kabbalah, especially as regards the metaphysical constructs presented regarding God's creation of the finite, material world. According to the Kabbalah, God's withdrawal from the central point of the completely unified pre-Creation Infinite Light (in which all the elements of which the natural world and physical existence are composed existed harmoniously as potentialities) resulted in a Vacated Space in which the finite, material could unfold. This withdrawal of God's Essence into itself set in motion the primordial exile that, while facilitating Creation, is the template for all the forms of separation and exile that underlie the existence of harsh judgment, evil and many of the other exigencies of mortal life. Accordingly, the ultimate purpose of a person's life is, through the leading of an exemplary spiritual existence, to help restore unity and harmony to all of Creation and furthermore to overcome the exile of the created universe from its creator.

Continued...page 18 Thus, there are many focal points and intricacies to the practice of Spiritual PhytoEssencing but ultimately its intent can be boiled down to helping an individual's soul, via the use of customized essential oil blends, overcome the force of separation - the kernel of discontent and sense of incompleteness embedded in everyone's existence. Separation takes the form of estrangement between rational, everyday con- sciousness and higher consciousness, between a person and God, between an individual and his or her own true self, between a person and the natural world, between a person and his or her beloved, children and other loved ones. Part II Cinnamon Oil and Birth Trauma Many essential oils, within a soul-level healing context, have varying degrees of relevance regarding birth trauma or particular aspects of birth trauma and/or separation anxiety. Below, I briefly allude to blue chamomile and pine. Other oils that come to mind, just to mention a few, include calendula, cardamom, carrot seed, celery seed, galbanum, jasmine, myrrh and neroli . In this article, I focus primarily on cinnamon oil . Cinnamon was held by the ancients to be precious in a spiritual sense. According to ancient myth, Phoenix collected cinnamon, along with myrrh and spikenard, for the magic fire in which it was reborn. Pliny (the Roman historian and naturalist) told of gold-encased cinnamon hanging in the main Roman temples. The Egyptians included cinnamon in their embalming mixtures both for its spiritual and physical properties. Cinnamon (as well as cassia) was an ingredient in the anointing oil and Qetoret (the holy temple incense) of the Jews. In aromatherapy, cinnamon oil is used in certain instances to treat the following relevant symptoms: mental exhaustion; nervous depression [especially in devitalized, emaciated deficient uterine contractions during birth delivery.Homeopathic Remedy Cinnamomum Some of the most valuable insights regarding the soul-nature of cinnamon oil can be provided by a review of the homeopathic remedy Cinnamomum , prepared from a tincture of the inner bark of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Cinnamomum cassia. Symptoms from the Cinnamomum picture relevant to our understanding of the soul nature of cinnamon oil as well as to this discussion of birth trauma include: no desire for anything; restless; delusion that all is diminished; bearing down sensations in the pelvis; menses early, profuse, prolonged and bright red; metrorrhagia [irregular and sometimes prolonged uterine bleeding] ; uterine hemorrhage (bright red blood) after delivery caused by over lifting, a strain in the muscles of the pelvis, stretching of the arms or even a false step; repeated small hemorrhages during pregnancy; miscarriage caused by over lifting or other form of hard physical exertion; miscarriage from thunderstorm; twitching during labor; post-partum hemorrhage. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 20The Trauma of Birth, Separation Anxiety and Essential Oils: PART II Bruce Berkowsky, N.M.D., M.H., H.M.C. Continued...page 19 Cinnamon, the Spleen-Pancreas and the Earth Element In Chinese medicine, cinnamon is considered to be an important spleen remedy. Cinnamon is considered to warm the spleen and be therapeutic to the spleen acupuncture meridian. It should be noted that in Chinese medicine the spleen and pancreas are considered to be components of the same organ sometimes referred to by Western practitioners of Chinese medicine as the spleen-pancreas . Within the context of the Five Element Theory (as well as the Six Element Paradigm of Spiritual PhytoEssencing), the spleen and pancreas are associated with the Earth element. In many of the ancient myths, the Earth is closely linked to motherliness, sustenance, security and safety, fertility, satiation and generosity. Hence, in the human being, healthy Earth expresses itself through compassion, empathy, security and a feeling of unity with Nature. Accordingly, one exp- eriences connectedness and a feeling of warm regard for others. There is also an objective understanding of one's own needs and a competence to fulfill them. When Earth is imbalanced, a person strays from the integral center to its polar fringes. He or she may be completely self-centered and emotionally separated from the needs of others, or obsessively com- passionate to the point of neglecting self-needs. Frequently, the individual swings like a pendulum be- tween these two poles. In this reference, cinnamon oil has the symptoms: emotional coldness; feelings of isolation; post-partum depression; introversion. Self-absorption or narcissism a feeling of emotional undernourishment. Insecurity, self-pity and craving for attention reign and there is the constant underlying fear of loss of warmth and affection. These individuals tend to lack compassion and shy away from trusting, intimate relationships. They may be overly critical of others and display a high degree of intolerance. In contrast, some individuals come to obsessively identify with the needs of others, and in the process, lose their sense of self, exhaust the vital resources required to sustain the organs of the metabolic-limb system, including the stomach and spleen-pancreas. Cinnamon, the Kidneys and BreathingCinnamon is also a kidney-specific. In Chinese medicine it is considered a tonic for the kidney acupuncture meridian and for Kidney Yang. In anthroposophical medicine, the kidneys are con- sidered to be the central organ of the air organization. While the lungs are the mechanical apparatus for breathing, the kidneys actually rule the breathing process. Hence, the lung/kidney relationship has special significance. Chinese medicine has a similar view on the connecting of dynamic-to-physical processes. This view holds that the kidneys are charged with \"grasping the chi.\" While the lungs are the mechanical facilitator of respiration, the kidneys enable the chi, borne by air, to penetrate deeply into the body. The kidneys are thus considered to be the \"root of chi\" while the lungs are the \"foundation of chi.\" The kidneys are also the central organ and air, the carrier of vital force. Vital force connects with the physical body via breathing. The lungs are one of the primary routes by which vital force enters the physical body. At the moment of death and the final exhalation, vital force disappears from the physical body forever. It is no coincidence that the word 'expire' is also a synonym for death.

Continued...page 20 The kidneys are noted by the Chinese as being the seat of \"fear and anxiety,\" both of which are found in the cinnamon oil picture. In China, fear is associated with the tremendous power of water that often manifests as floods or tidal waves. It's also associated with water deficiency as when there is famine as a result of drought. Fear is a survival-related mech- anism, but when the kidneys are weakened, it may be disproportionately experienced. Anxiety and panic attacks are related to the fear mechanism. It's important to remember that the adrenal glands, part of the \"fight or flight\" response team, adjoin and work closely with the kidneys. What Is A Miasm? A miasm is the homeopathic concept of an archetypal reaction mode, transmitted from generation to gen- eration bio-energetically rather than genetically. The miasm is not an actual disease state, but rather, a complex of constitutional characteristics and reaction tendencies that resembles the emotional theme and physical disharmony proneness profile reminiscent of an individual who is actually suffering from the disease for which it is named. In Spiritual PhytoEssencing, a miasm is also considered to be transferable as an archetypal component from one life incarnation to a subsequent one within the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. In other words, an individual with a strong constitutional Cancer miasm component may have actually been afflicted with that disease in a previous life. Each of the miasms has characteristic physical and emotional symptoms, which, in conjunction, announce its presence. Essential oils are traditionally described in relation to certain physical, psychological and spiritual symptoms upon which they have been observed to have the potential to exert an ameliorating action. It is possible to begin to determine specific essential oil/miasm affinities through careful examination and correlation of the symptoms for which an essential oil is considered to be potentially useful. Death-Rebirth MiasmIn addition to the Cancer miasm, cinnamon also has an affinity for what is referred to in Spiritual PhytoEssencing as the Death-Rebirth miasm . This miasmatic category is derived from the work of Dutch homeopath and psychologist Harry van der Zee as presented in his book Miasms in Labour . Van der Zee's premise is that miasms are connected to specific stages of the birth process and play an essential role in the process of physical and emotional development. Van der Zee himself refers to the Death-Rebirth miasm as the \"Acute\" miasm. However, as his understanding of the Acute miasm is far different from the one (based upon the work of homeopath Dr. Rajan Sankaran) used in Spiritual PhytoEssencing, I have renamed van der Zee's version of the Acute miasm as the Death-Rebirth miasm in order to differentiate between the two in Spiritual PhytoEssencing work. Van der Zee assigns the following qualities to this miasm: transformation, sudden change, destruction, life and death, release of enormous power, fire, heat, violence, destruction and transcendence. Continued...page 22 \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 22The Trauma of Birth, Separation Anxiety and Essential Oils: PART II Bruce Berkowsky, N.M.D., M.H., H.M.C. miasm are: sudden transformation, purifying heat, reconnecting with the divine, elimination of boundaries, vulnerability, profound decompression, the nurturing breast and protection. The appellation I have assigned van der Zee's version of the Acute miasm is based upon his association of this miasm with the death-rebirth experience. Van der Zee writes: \"When everything seems to have failed, when the ego dies, then unexpectedly there is a moment of birth, of new life, like the phoenix... This is a sudden moment. All boundaries and constrictions suddenly fall away...The idea of sud- den change together with a purifying heat makes us think of acute diseases accompanied by high fevers...the birth crisis, being the blueprint of all crises in our life suggests that the acute should be placed at the end, thus marking the transformation.\" Van der Zee perceives this acute crisis as a sudden change which succeeds a chronic process. In this view, consistent with the Eastern model of death and subsequent rebirth, the acute is a bridging stage between the termination of one cycle and the beginning of another. In the birth process, the displacement of the fetus from the uterus represents an existential crisis wherein the baby must switch from a placenta-delivered oxygen supply to breathing on his or her own. In a sense, the end of the fetal stage of life is a type of death or, at the very least, a confrontation with potential annihilation that terminates either in death or last minute escape. The acute transformation from fetal life to infancy via parturition bears a resemblance to the life-to-afterlife transition described by mystics and those who have had near-death experiences in that both involve a transition from a dark passageway into light. Both processes deliver the individual from darkness into light, space and freedom. The concept of fire associated with the Death-Rebirth miasm derives from the acute consuming nature of the death-rebirth experience wherein the old is immolated and the new arises from its ashes. Van der Zee remarks: \"The acute diseases children have, with high fevers could be viewed as a finishing off or deepening of this [the fetal-infancy transformational] experience. The observation that children, when allowed to go through these episodes, make remarkable progress in their development sustains the idea that acutes help the individual incarnate fully.\" This is a very important observation. It has long been theorized by naturopaths that the acute diseases of childhood are required for the full development of the immune system and thus their suppression produces life-long immunological weakness. Now we see that these ailments may be just as important for the full evolution of both the soul and body. Separation and the Nurturing BreastThe acute concept of the \"nurturing breast\" is a crucial one. When the symbiotic union between mother and child is severed, the first experiences the child has in the outside world will strongly influence her lifelong psycho-spiritual nature. If she encounters warmth, protection and nurturing succor, no root for psycho-spiritual pathology will be established in this phase. One of the central elements in this seamless transition is the nurturing breast which, aside from being the child's ideal nutritional source, also serves as a psycho-spiritual link back to the safety and comfort of the \"nurturing womb.\" Thus, if the child's early experience of the outer world is one of coldness, hostility and defective nutrition then he/she will be at great risk for developing acute pathologies.

Continued...page 22 In this reference, relevant cinnamon oil picture properties and symptoms include: cinnamon is sometimes used to dry up the secretion of breast milk; post-partum depression; introversion; for anything; fear; nervousness; insomnia. Cinnamon and Fire The element of fire is an important one in the cinnamon picture. Cinnamon is a plant that lives in the heat of the tropics and exerts a warming effect upon the body. It has also been used extensively to treat fever and febrile disorders such as typhoid fever. In homeopathy, the theme of fire is an important one regarding remedies prepared from snake venom. Van der Zee remarks: \"The element of fire, combined with transformation, we also see in the snake of the 'Kundalini fire' that rises from its coiled up position at the base of the spine [the root chakra] to the higher chakras.\" Significantly, the hemorrhagic disorders of cinnamon occur primarily in the pelvic organs, the realm of the root chakra. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus (successor to Aristotle), held that cinnamon trees grew in ravines full of deadly snakes. Accordingly, those who risked gathering cinnamon always left a portion of their harvest as an offering to the sun-god (note theme of fire here as well) in order to secure his protection on future cinnamon-gathering missions among the reptiles. As mentioned earlier, a pivotal folkloric cinnamon myth regarding the Death-Rebirth miasm is the one which holds that Phoenix collected cinnamon, along with myrrh and spikenard for the magic fire in which it was reborn. The Cinnamon Oil IndividualTypically, the cinnamon type has, in a broad-sense, undergone a rebirth in his life in that he felt compelled to remake his image in his own eyes. He struggles with might and main to effect the \"death\" of his doubt-filled self, so that he may be reborn as an individual who is secure in his self-worth. Also, he has commonly experienced a severe hemorrhagic disorder, perhaps a traumatic wound or ulcerative colitis. In the case of a female cinnamon oil type there also may be a history of severe life-threatening hemorrhage accompanying miscarriage, parturition, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, etc, which brought her to the brink of death. Often, an encounter with death initiates a \"rebirth\" which changes one's sense of self and vision of life. Using Cinnamon Oil The primary chemical component of the bark oil is cinnamaldehyde which is a potent skin-irritant. Therefore undiluted application to the skin is inadvisable. It should be noted that in Spiritual PhytoEssencing, essential oils are used as part of a blend of different oils. Rarely are individual oils used in isolation. This is especially true of a very potent, potentially irritating oil such as cinnamon oil. Also the oil, having a very strong, intense aroma, must be used in very small quantities in an oil blend lest it completely dominate that blend's scent dynamics. Therefore, if it is determined that it is appropriate in a given case to use cinnamon oil to help address birth trauma or separation anxiety, it is best to use it in combination with other potentially relevant oils such as blue chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) and pine oil ( Pinus spp.) For reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, in Spiritual PhytoEssencing, lavender oil is added to every blend that is prepared to help harmonize all the other component oils and serve as a center around which the diverse oils can organize. To give you an example of how little cinnamon oil should be used in a blend, when I prepare a blend of approximately 150 drops in which cinnamon is a component, I use an absolute maximum of 2 drops of cinnamon oil in that blend. If you feel that, in a particular instance, using cinnamon oil in isolation is the right approach, consider the following dilution method: 1) Mix one drop of unadulterated cinnamon oil with 9 drops of unrefined coconut oil (you may have to liquefy the coconut oil first by gently warming it). Shake well.

Shake well. 3) Finally, repeat step #2 and prepare a third sequential dilution. You have now prepared a 1:1000 dilution of cinnamon oil that is essentially a 3X potency homeopathic remedy. Applying the Blend or Diluted Cinnamon OilWhether working with a blend of oils which contains cinnamon (e.g., blue chamomile, pine, cinnamon and lavender) or the diluted cinnamon oil preparation, restrict use to external application only. Don't overdo. Only 2 to 3 applications per week of 2 drops of either the blend or the 3X cinnamon dilution, would generally be the outside limit. Remember this is soul-level healing work with essential oils, not clinical aromatherapy. The goal is not to vanquish a symptom but simply to introduce an oil (or oils) to a person's soul and, if that oil (or blend of oils) is indeed relevant for that individual, allow his or her soul to process the potential carried by that oil's own soul presence and respond as it sees fit.Given cinnamon's association with both the spleen pancreas and the kidney, consider applying the blend or the 3X cinnamon dilution to the solar plexus chakra (Earth element) and to the abdominal kidney reflex points (bilateral points located 1\" above and 1\" to either side of the navel).

Lunny, MD, RA, MDMA, FIFA This article will look at the characteristics of infectious diseases of childhood, their physical, emotional and psychological effects on the sufferers and their treatment with aromatherapy. In addition we will also investigate some of the underlying causes of childhood allergies which give rise to conditions such as hyperactivity, asthma and eczema and their management in clinical aromatherapy. Infectious Viral Diseases of ChildhoodThe most common childhood diseases are due to viral infections and as such, their orthodox treatment is geared mainly to prevent the onset of secondary opportunistic bacterial infections. The common factor of these diseases, namely measles, rubella, and chicken pox is the appearance of localized lesions of the skin which, as we will see, appear at different times and stages according to the specific illnesses. The rashes show a combination of the following types of skin lesions, in different combinations according to each illness:Macules : are small areas of discoloration of the skin which are seen but not felt because they are neither raised nor depressed or thickened. They may be depigmented, purpuric, erythematous or pigmented. Papules : are palpable elevations of the skin of up to 5mm in diameter, with pointed, rounded or flat surfaces. They are not deep seated in the skin and are formed by the proliferation of the skin cells by infiltration or exudation of cells and fluid into the skin. It may be possible to distinguish between predominantly dermal or epidermal papules by touch. Vesicles : are small blisters of up to 5mm in diameter formed by the accumulation of fluid in the skin associated with disintegration of cells in the affected areas. They are usually filled with clear, serous fluid; an example can be seen in chickenpox. Pustules: are yellow vesicles where the fluid contained in them has leukocytes. They are usually follicular, as in coccal folliculitis. Non pustules simplex or herpes zoster (shingles). The main communicable viral diseases of childhood : Measles Measles is one of the most highly contagious infectious diseases. The virus is transmitted by airborne droplets, and is easily spread from person to person. The virus, a paramyxovirus, enters the body through the upper respiratory tract. It has an incubation period of 10 to 12 days and the first apparent signs are fever, coughs, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. At this point the child (or adult) becomes contagious. It usually causes a characteristic rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes and can last from 1 to 2 weeks. Its more serious complications are: middle ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and, very unusually, encephalitis leading to convulsions, deafness, mental handicap or death. The onset of the characteristic measles rash usually starts 14 days after exposure. The characteristic maculo-papular measles rash begins 2-4 days after the onset of fever.

Lunny, MD, RA, MDMA, FIFA Continued...page 26 It appears first on the face and neck, the arms and legs, and then spreads to the trunk and abdomen. The measles rash is an exanthema as well as an enanthema, with characteristic spots in the mouth mucosae called Koplick spots. The rash lasts from 2 to 5 days. A person becomes contagious at the time the fever begins and remains contagious for 7 to 9 days after fever begins, or 4-5 days after the rash appears. Although most children recover completely, measles can cause complications. Severe cases may develop complications such as ear problems, diarrhoea, pneumonia, brain damage, and even death. Infants and adults usually are sicker than children and teenagers. Key symptoms of measles are: A maculo-papular rash Kopliks spots High fever Runny nose Red watery eyes Dry cough The diagnosis of measles is often made based on the signs and symptoms. The measles symptoms given above often come with sensitivity to light. The most definitive method of diagnosing measles is by either isolating the virus from the throat, or by a blood test for antibodies. Treatment: The measles vaccine was first used in 1963, and according to statistics has had a major role in the decrease of the disease since then. The general management of a patient with measles is bed rest, maintenance of fluids intake, and medication for fever and headache. The preventive use of antibiotics is of no value and may increase the risk of severe secondary bacterial infection. Presently, there are no antiviral drugs available for treatment of measles. Aromatherapeutic Management: The aromatherapy management of measles is geared to alleviate the symptoms while, at the same time, preventing the possible complications. The most beneficial methods of treatment are tepid immersion baths, cold compresses, topical application of essential oil blends, and diffusers. The choice of essential oils will depend on individual needs, but the oils should be chosen for the following properties: febrifuge, calming, relaxing, and antiviral. A very effective essential oil blend which has been invaluable with the treatment of younger children is: 3 drops lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) 2 drops Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) 3 drops eucalyptus (Eucalyptus smithii) 2 drops melissa (Melissa officinalis) Or3 drops bergamot (Citrus bergamia) 2 drops tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) 2 drops lemon (Citrus limonum) Three drops of this essential oil blend can then be used in a 1.5% dilution in sweet almond (Prunus amigdalus) or in rosehip seed oil (Rosa rubiginosa) and very gently effleuraged on the areas which have the maculopapular rash. Conversely the same may be used in the bath, or undiluted in an aroma-lamp to slowly diffuse into the room. Rubella-German Measles Rubella usually occurs in the winter and spring and spreads very easily. People catch it through contact with other people who are infected. It is spread through coughing, sneezing, or talking. Usually rubella causes a slight fever which lasts for about 24 hours, and a rash on the face and neck that lasts two or three days. Young adults who get rubella may get swollen glands in the back of the neck and some pain, swelling, or stiffness in their joints (arthritis). Most people recover quickly and completely from rubella. The virus is a non-arthropod borne toga virus. The greatest danger from rubella is not to children or adults, but to unborn babies. If a woman gets rubella in the early months of her pregnancy, her chance of giving birth to a deformed baby may be as high as 80%. These babies may be born deaf or blind. They may have damaged hearts or unusually small brains, Continued...page 28\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 28The Aromatherapeutic Management of Infectious Childhood Diseases Dr. Vivian N. Lunny, MD, RA, MDMA, FIFA Continued...page 27 liver or skin problems. Rubella virus is spread by contact with discharges from nose or throat. The virus is usually shed in the discharges from about 7 days before the rash until at least 4 days after the rash begins. Rubella virus is passed to the next person by direct contact with the secretions. Babies with rubella acquired at or before birth can continue to shed virus in nose and throat secretions and in urine for 1 year or more. Anyone can get rubella except those who have had rubella or rubella vaccine. Symptoms start within 16-18 days after exposure, with a range of 14-23 days. Up to half of all people who get rubella don't have any symptoms. Unborn babies are at high risk of rubella complications. Most children and adults fully recover from rubella with few complications. Key Symptoms of Rubella: Low fever Macular rash (lasts 3 days or less) which starts on the face and behind the ears and spreads down There is always pharyngitis and enlargement of the cervical and posterior cervical lymph glands Joint aches Treatment: Rubella can be prevented with rubella vaccine. The general management of a patient with rubella is bed rest, maintenance of intake of fluids, and medication for fever and headache. The preventive use of antibiotics is of no value and may increase the risk of severe secondary bacterial infection. Presently, there are no antiviral drugs available for treatment of rubella. Aromatherapeutic Management: The aromatherapy management of rubella is geared to alleviating the symptoms while preventing the possible complications. The most beneficial methods of treatment are tepid immersion baths, cold compresses, topical application of essential oil blends, and diffusers. The choice of essential oils will depend on individual needs, but the oils should be chosen for the following properties: febrifuge, calming, relaxing, and antiviral. A very effective blend which has been invaluable with the treatment of younger children is: 3 drops lavender (Lavandula latifolia) 2 drops Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) 3 drops lemon (Citrus limonum) 2 drops cedarwood (Cedrus atlamtica) Or 3 drops myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) 2 tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) 2 drops frankincense (Boswellia frereana) Three drops of this essential oil blend can then be used in a 1.5% dilution in sweet almond (Prunus amigdalus) or in rosehip seed oil (Rosa rubiginosa) and very gently effleuraged on the areas which have the maculopapular rash. The same blend may be used in the bath, or undiluted in an aroma-lamp to slowly diffuse into the room. Chickenpox-Varicella Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease that is acquired through contact with the virus directly by touching the blisters or respiratory secretions, or through the air. A person is usually infectious 1-2 days before the rash, to 4-5 days after the start of the rash, or until the blisters have formed crusts. Symptoms start about 2-3 weeks after exposure and include fever, tiredness, and an itchy rash with small vesicles that dry up and form scabs in 2-4 days. The vesicles appear in successive waves so that the lesions are at different stages, giving the appearance of a starry sky. The vesicles develop further into pustules before they dry.

Lunny, MD, RA, MDMA, FIFA Continued...page 28 More severe but rare problems or complications that could occur are pneumonia (especially in adults), skin infection, blood infection, or brain involvement (encephalitis). If there are any signs of infection such as fever, redness, warmth, swelling, or if the fever persists or comes back after it has gone away, check with a physician. Key Symptoms of Chickenpox: Itchy rash with small blisters. Most people get chickenpox when they are young. Approximately 90% of chickenpox cases are in children 1-14 years of age, and 90% of people have had chickenpox by their early 20's. The disease is usually mild and not life-threatening in otherwise healthy children, but is more serious in new-born babies and in adults. Some people are at risk of complications from chickenpox: Pregnant women who have not had chickenpox before (their unborn baby may be affected). An infant born to a mother who has not had chick- enpox before. A newborn baby whose mother has an onset of chickenpox 5 days before to 2 days after delivery. People with leukaemia, immune suppression, or immunodeficiency (including HIV). People who catch chickenpox as an adult. Children under 18 with chickenpox should not be in contact with others. Continuous household contact. Playmate contact of greater than one hour. Hospital contact involving the same bedroom, or adjacent beds in a large ward. Prolonged face-to-face contact. If you have chickenpox or shingles, stay away from others until the blisters are dry and crusted. The new-born child is at increased risk of serious infection. If the mother develops chickenpox between 5 days before delivery and 48 hours after delivery, the new-born infant may develop a serious infection. Infants whose mothers develop chickenpox outside the \"5 days before to 48 hours after delivery\" window do not appear to be at increased risk of serious illness. Premature infants who have significant exposure after birth may be at increased risk for serious illness. This is especially true for those infants born before 28 weeks of gestation, or those whose mothers are not immune to chickenpox. Aromatherapeutic Management: The aromatherapy management of chickenpox is geared to alleviating the symptoms, while at the same time preventing the possible complications. The most beneficial methods of treatment are tepid immersion baths, cold compresses, topical application of essential oil blends, and diffusers. The choice of essential oils will depend on individual needs, but the oils should be chosen for the following properties: febrifuge, calming, relaxing, and antiviral. A very effective blend which has been invaluable with the treatment of younger children is: 3 drops lavender (Lavandula intermedia) 2 drops of Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) 3 drops myrtle (Myrtus communis) 2 drops of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) Or 3 drops grapefruit (Citrus grandis) 3 drops ravensara (Ravensara aromatica) 2 drops tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) 2 drops sweet orange (Citrus reticulata) Three drops of this essential oil blend can then be used in a 1.5% dilution in sweet almond oil (Prunus amigdalus) or in rosehip seed oil (rosa rubiginosa) and very gently effleuraged on the areas which have the maculopapular rash. The same blend may be used in the bath, or undiluted in an aroma-lamp to slowly diffuse into the room. Fifth Disease (Erythema Infectiosum) Fifth disease is a mild rash illness. It is caused by a human virus called Parvovirus B19 and primarily affects school age children between 5 and 14 years of age. A person with fifth disease usually spreads the virus before the rash starts. The virus is spread by exposure to airborne droplets from the nose and throat of infected people. The virus can also be transmitted by blood or blood products. Continued...page 30\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 30The Aromatherapeutic Management of Infectious Childhood Diseases Dr. Vivian N. Lunny, MD, RA, MDMA, FIFA Continued...page 29 Symptoms and signs: A red, patchy rash on the face resembling \"slapped cheeks,\" is most common. The rash may appear on other parts of the body (such as the arms, trunk, buttocks, and thighs). Other symptoms such as fever, headache, body ache, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, cough, nausea, or diarrhea may come before the rash. In adults, joint pains or arthritis is likely to occur. Symptoms usually start 4 to 20 days after a person has been exposed. About 25% of all cases have no symptoms. In both children and adults, the disease is usually mild and recovery occurs without problems. Key Symptoms of the Fifth Disease: A red, patchy rash appears on the face. This rash is erythemathous. The rash on the body becomes maculopapular lesions which fade from the centre leaving a red periphery and adopting a characteristic lace like or reticular pattern. Fever Headache Body ache Sore throat Congestion Runny nose Cough Nausea Diarrhea Mild generalised Lymphadenopathy There is a blood test, but it is not widely available. A blood test for antibodies is used to see if a person is currently infected or was infected in the past. The blood test is used primarily for pregnant women exposed to fifth disease. In most cases, the disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of a typical rash. There is no vaccine for fifth disease at this time. Some people are at higher risk if they get fifth disease: a pregnant woman who has not had fifth disease before can cause problems for the unborn baby.The greatest risk of viral spread is before symptoms begin. Few control measures are possible. Those at risk should check with their doctor: Pregnant women, women considering pregnancy, and others at risk should realize that they may catch fifth disease from family members, others in the community, and in child care, school or other occupational settings. Pregnant women and others at risk should consult with their physicians if they have been in contact with a case of fifth disease. The doctor may want to check the blood to see if they are susceptible. Routine exclusion of those at risk from settings where fifth disease is occurring is not recommended since the risk depends on whether the person is already immune. Each exposure needs to be individually evaluated. Aromatherapeutic Management: The aromatherapy management of Fifth Disease is geared to alleviating the symptoms, while at the same time preventing the possible complications. The most beneficial methods of treatment are tepid immersion baths, cold compresses, topical application of essential oil blends, and diffusers.The choice of essential oils will depend on individual needs, but the oils should be chosen for the following properties: febrifuge, calming, relaxing, and antiviral. A very effective blend which has been invaluable with the treatment of younger children is: 3 drops lavender (Lavandula intermedia) 2 drops Roman chamomile (Chamoemelum nobile) (Myrtus comunis) drops tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) 2 drops sweet orange (Citrus reticulata) Three drops of this essential oil blend can then be used in a 1.5% dilution in sweet almond oil (Prunus amigdalus) or in rosehip seed oil (rosa rubiginosa) and very gently effleuraged on the areas which have the maculopapular rash.

But recently, partly due to my family growing and having clients with teenage children, I have developed a fascination and intrigue about using essential oils for adolescents. There is very little written about this client group in relation to aromatherapy, so I have learned as I have gone along. As a result, I have compiled enough information to put together a one day CPD* course to share my experience with other aromatherapists who also want to treat this client group. I have a regular core of clients who are children, some already in puberty, some already out the other side, and some still in primary education. Quite often they are the children of existing adult clients. Some of them have particular physical ailments but most simply desire to experience massage with essential oils. One young boy in particular badgered his Mum so much every time she came for a treatment that, in the end, she booked him a session and he loved it! Many of these children, and my own, are growing rapidly as children do, so it seemed totally natural to take 'my area of expertise,' so to speak, to the next level. Puberty & AdolescencePuberty, comes from the Latin puberatum meaning \"age of maturity,\" and is the term given to the process of physical changes by which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilization. Puberty is measured by The Tanner Scale, a 5 stage scale that was introduced by James Tanner, a British paediatric endocrinologist. It focuses on the physical changes that occur during puberty. On average, a girl will start pre puberty changes around the age of 8-9 and reach the end of puberty around age 14. In boys, puberty starts approx at age 9-11 and ends around age 15. In girls, the scale measures height, growth of the breasts, development of pubic hair, both genital and underarm, changes to the genitals and the onset of menstruation. In boys it focuses on growth rate, changes to the genitals, growth of genital, facial and underarm pubic hair, vocal changes, first ejaculation and muscle development.Recent research shows that children in the 1 st world are reaching puberty earlier. A study carried out by The Department of Growth and Reproduction at University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2006, found that among 1,000 girls, the average age of breast development was nine years and 10 months, a full year earlier than when a similar study was conducted in 1991. \"We were very surprised that there had been such a change in a period of just 15 years,\" researcher Anders Juul said. The cause of early puberty remains contested, but the condition has been convincingly linked both to increased obesity rates and to exposure to endocrine-disrupting toxins such as bisphenol A, the chemical found in plastic water bottles and lining canned foods and beverages. There is evidence that 'bisphenol A' functions as a xenoestrogen by binding strongly to oestrogen-related receptors, disrupting normal hormone levels.

In girls FSH promotes the development of an ovum, and in the boy, sperm. Whilst in girls LH triggers ovulation, in a boy it stimulates production of testosterone. Adolescence is from the Latin adolescere, meaning \"to grow up,\" and is considered to be the transitional stage of physical and psychological human development generally occurring between puberty and legal adulthood. In the past, a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult, often with this shift being marked by some type of coming-of-age test or ceremony. However, from the 1950's onward, the advent of the 'teenager' status gave the adolescent, or teenager, their own defined period of time. Alongside the obvious changes in the sexual characteristics there is recent research to show changes to the brain, social development and effects of the media. It has been discovered that folds and creases of the brain rapidly develop through adolescence, mainly in the cognitive and emotional areas. By the time individuals have reached age 15 or so, their basic thinking abilities are comparable to those of adults. Self concept, self esteem and self identity are all areas that develop at this time. Relationships within the family unit change causing the adolescent to question their position and role within the family. Peer groups become important for self identity and can have a very positive influence on the growing child as they experience developing emotions of empathy, sharing and leadership. However 'peer pressure' can also lead to a negative influence and cause teenagers to experiment with drugs and alcohol, truancy, stealing and vandalism. There is much debate over the impact that media has on adolescent development and behaviour. However, because adolescents choose which media they're exposed to, it is very difficult for researchers to distinguish cause and effect. But in a modern, fast moving world with mobile communications and exposure to multimedia everywhere we look, there seems little doubt that the media certainly has a profound influence on us all. Treatment & Essential Oils As with my clients of any age, prior to the first session I will explain what happens during a treatment. I take a full consultation at the first meeting. With minors, I ask the parent to sign the consultation sheet and to be present for the first massage. Then, between the 3 of us, we negotiate if the parent attends future treatments. I always state on my follow up sheet if the parent/guardian was present. During their first consultation I encourage these clients to talk about their eating and sleeping habits, friendship groups, levels of energy and self esteem and their hobbies/activities outside school. I always include my clients in the choice of oils and I find with teenagers they really know what they like, are very honest and will always say if something doesn't suit! Regarding treatment with essential oils, I am going to focus on 3 areas of adolescent/puberty care because these few seem to be relevant to the majority of teenagers. The list of essential oils suggested in this article does not contain the only ones that could be appropriate to use. Like in all client populations, specific individual issues may call for specific essences. Acne It is worth knowing and sharing with your adolescent client that frequent washing with astringent products does not in fact aid the skin but only encourages more sebum to be produced which can, in the long run, exacerbate the condition. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 34Aromatherapy for Adolescence TIDHA, sebum production Minimise scarring Reduce inflammation Reduce stress and anxiety Lower bacteria levels Base oil Some clients are fearful of putting oil on to their already oily skin. I have found the use of jojoba (Simmondsia sinensis) to be well tolerated within the group. Because the molecular structure is similar to sebum it has been cited as being useful for Acne. Essential Oils Lemon (Citrus limon) Physical properties: Antibacterial, AntimicrobialPsychological properties: RefreshingCaution - the expressed oil is phototoxic and the antibacterial property is short lived. Using distilled lemon oil will avoid the phototoxic property. (Author's note: If using expressed lemon oil for skin care, do not use more than 2% to the bergamia) Caution - Phototoxic, not to be used at more than 0.4% in a blend. Or use Bergamot FCF Infectious mononucleosis/ mono / glandular feverHard to diagnose, presents as flu like symptoms with spells of intense lethargy. The virus is passed from person to person in saliva which is why it's sometimes called 'the kissing disease' and why it so prevalent in the teenage community. In some cases it can lead to ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis). Do not treat if client presents with a fever. Aromatherapy aims: Boost the Immune System Assist with sleep Relieve achy muscles and joints Restore energy levels \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 35Aromatherapy for Adolescence Jo ( Lavandula angustifolia) Physical properties: Sedative, AnalgesicPsychological properties: Tonic - useful for relaxation and restoration, stress, insomnia, anxiety Bergamot (Citrus bergamia) Caution - Phototoxic, not to be used at more than 0.4% in a blend. Or use Bergamot FCF which Refreshing and uplifting - useful for chronic immune weakness Menstrual cycle Menarche usually occurs 2 years or so after the first sign of breast development. It will then usually take between 12-18 months for a regular cycle to develop. If a client presents with amenorrhea it is best to refer her to her General Practitioner.Aromatherapy aims: To ease dysmenorrhoea - excessive pain will need to be referred to physician Assist with PMS Energy levels Essential Oils Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) Physical properties: Sedative The Importance of Touch Alongside the powerful nature of the oils is of course the additional benefit of the massage itself. At a time when the young adult may be moving away from touch at home causing fewer cuddles with Mum or Dad, less chance to hold hands while walking, massage will address the need to receive the tactile stimulation we all require to thrive. Some teenagers report awkwardness in their bodies, like it doesn't belong to them anymore. The changes that are occurring overpower their identity in some way. Massage has the ability to bring a sense of 'you' to you; there is something about touch through massage that is almost akin to meditation and a focus on the body encouraging grounding and strengthening in the self. It is a joy to treat this particular client group. It is helping me as a parent as it furthers my knowledge as a therapist. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 36Aromatherapy for Puberty Adolescence Jo S Getz, 2008 'The adolescent brain & age related behavioural manifestations' LP Spear 2000 'Age Differences in Resistance to Peer Influence' L Steinberg, K C Monahan 2007 'Structural Evidence for Endocrine Disruptor Bisphenol A Binding to Human Nuclear Receptor ERR ', A Matsushima, Y Kakuta, T Teramoto, The Journal of Biochemistry, 2007 Books 'Growth' J Tanner, GR Taylor, 1981 'Touching, the Human Significance of the Skin' A Montague, 1971 'Carrier oils for Aromatherapy & Massage' L Price with I Smith & S Price, 1999 'Aromatherapy for Healing the Spirit' G Mojay, 1996'Essential Oils Safety' R Tisserand, Jo graduated from the The Tisserand Institute in 1996.

The sleep-wake cycle is a manifestation of circadian rhythm, a biological rhythm that oscillates through a 24 hour period and is governed by cycles of light and dark. In humans, these rhythms take several months to develop which is why newborns usually have irregu-lar sleep cycles until about three to six months of age. Until we reach about the age of two, most of us have spent more time asleep than awake, but as we get older our need for sleep decreases (to a point). By the time a child is 5 years old he or she needs 10 to 11 hours of sleep a day and this continues until around age 12, by which time most children will do well with 8 to 10 hours of good quality sleep each night. \"Good quality\" sleep is sleep that is characterized by normal cycling through REM and non-Rem sleep. A number of important things happen while we are asleep: cellular repair takes place, our energy is restored and, very importantly for children, hormones are released for growth and development. Inadequate sleep can have substantial impacts on a child's devel-opment and everyday functioning. Problems associ-ated with inadequate sleep in children and adoles-cents include anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, immune system depression, cognitive problems, poor school performance, and impaired social relationships. Some cases of insomnia (sleep disturbance) are misdiagnosed as learning disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder, and/or emo-tional problems but all of these problems can also be a cause of and caused by sleep disturbance. In attempting to address insomnia in children and ado-lescents it is important to understand that insomnia is a symptom not a diagnosis. Many things can cause insomnia and this is why a thorough physical and psychological evaluation should be made before attempting differential diagnosis of such problems. In fact, aromatherapists who are not medical doctors or child psychologists should not undertake \"treatment\" of sleep problems in children and adolescents except under the consulting supervision of their physician. Occasional insomnia in a child or teenager for specific reasons, such as excitement on the eve of a big event, is not serious and is appropriately handled by parents. Recurrent insomnia in children and adolescents merits a discussion with the physician and/or pediatric psychologist. When these problems are mild or tran-sient the physician or psychologist will often recom-mend behavioral approaches and in many cases no further intervention is needed. Referral to a sleep specialist should be considered under the following circumstances: children or adolescents with persistent or severe bedtime issues that are not responsive to simple behavioral measures or that are extremely disruptive children or adolescents with parasomnias (sleep walking, bedwetting, nightmares, abnormal move-ments, etc.) who also present with symptoms of another underlying sleep disrupter (for example, sleep-disordered breathing) or for whom pharmaco-logic treatment is being considered children with associated medical, psychiatric, or developmental conditions that create additional chal-lenges children and adolescents with circadian rhythm disorders (1). Sleep problems are a frequent complaint in pediatric clinics and the percentage of typically developing children and adolescents who experience sleep prob-lems is quite high, varying between about 20% and 50% (2) (3), although only about 4% have an ICD-9 sleep disorder diagnosis (4). Sleep problems are even more common among children with develop-mental disabilities, learning disabilities and psycho-emotional disorders; for example, 73% of children with autism and Asperger's disorder have been found to have impaired sleep (3). The types of sleep problems that children experience vary with age. Continued...page 40\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 40Aromatherapy in Practice: Addressing Sleep Problems in School Age Children and Adolescents Dr. Joie Power, Ph.D. Continued...page 39 Younger children are more likely to have oppositional behavior at bedtime or difficulty with nighttime awak- ening, while among adolescents, changes in circadian rhythms associated with hormonal fluctuations together with increased social stress often result in impaired sleep-onset, poor sleep quality and/or inad- equate total sleep time. Pediatricians are often understandably (and appropri- ately) reluctant to give a formal diagnosis of sleep disorder and to recommend pharmacological treat-ment, especially in typically developing children. There is no drug that has been assigned a pediatric indication for sleep problems(5); all of the drugs that are sometimes used to treat sleep disorders in children are drugs approved for adult usage and while they are often effective, all come with potentially serious side effects. For example, clonidine is one of the drugs widely used in pediatric practice for the treatment of sleep disorders and while it can be effec-tive in decreasing the time before sleep onset it may produce hypotension, bradycardia and rebound hypertension (5). The treatment approach most frequently recommended by pediatricians involves behavioral interventions while pharmacological treat-ment is recommended in only about 15% of cases and parents are advised that children will outgrow the problems in nearly 50% of cases (6). Behavioral inter-ventions for sleep problems in children and adoles-cents have been shown to be effective in many cases. Strategies for improving \"sleep hygiene\" fall into this category: \"sleep hygiene\" includes things such as: lighting and noise levels in the bedroom, reserving the bedroom for sleeping and not using it for studying and watching television, avoiding evening consumption of caffeine containing foods and similar measures that eliminate potential sleep disrupters and foster good sleeping habits. In my experience in pediatric settings many sleep problems in children and adolescents can be relieved simply by practicing good sleep hygiene. Melatonin is sometimes recommended by pediatri- cians for addressing sleep problems in children and especially in adolescents. Melatonin has a chronobi- otic effect which means that as well as having sleep- inducing properties it can help restore normal circa-dian rhythms. The doses of melatonin used with children and adolescents are low and even though this is an over-the-counter medication, parents should consult with a pediatrician prior to using this with a child or adolescent. Although there is little empirical evidence to support the practice in children, over-the counter antihistamines are also sometimes recom-mended by pediatricians for young patients with sleep problems. These are effective in some cases although, in my experience, paradoxical reactions in which the drug causes anxiety and/or hyper-arousal are not uncommon. Again, parents should consult with a pediatrician before giving antihistamines to a child or adolescent with sleep problems. Although pediatricians are not yet widely aware of the use of essential oils for addressing sleep problems they are showing an increased interest in complemen-tary and alternative therapies in general and the number of referrals for such therapies by pediatricians is increasing. As a part of this trend both traditional herbal medicine and aromatherapy are gaining some recognition as potential alternatives to standard drug therapy in some areas of pediatric practice, including sleep disorders. For an interesting read on the use of aromatherapy in pediatrics see \"A Pediatric Perspec-tive on Aromatherapy,\" by Fitzgerald and Halcon (7). Continued...page 41 Melatonin Molecule\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 41Aromatherapy in Practice: Addressing Sleep Problems in School Age Children and Adolescents Dr. Joie Power, Ph.D. Continued...page 40 Owens, et al., in their summary report of a multi- disciplinary task force meeting on pediatric insomnia sponsored by the American Academy of Sleep Medi-cine list valerian, German chamomile, kava, and lavender as phytomedicines that have been used in the treatment of pediatric sleep disorders (1). They fail to specify what preparations of the plants were used but lavender, valerian, and chamomile essential oils all have the reputation of promoting sleep and both lavender and chamomile essential oils have long been used by aromatherapists to promote sleep in children as well as adults. Wheatly, in a review of medicinal plants used in the treatment of insomnia, mentions lavender, ylang ylang, and chamomile essential oils as agents that improve sleep and he describes aromatherapy as a \"tantalizing possibility\" for treat- ment of insomnia even though the evidence on which it is based is often \"incomplete or missing\" (8). In gen-eral, studies on the efficacy of popular aromatherapy interventions for sleep have been mixed and, as is the case throughout the field of aromatherapy, evaluation of conflicting results is difficult because of issues related to experimental design, sample size, and proper botanical specification and sourcing of the essential oils used in the studies. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil has received the most attention among researchers in the area of sleep disturbance and has the greatest empiri-cal support for its sleep-inducing effects in both children and adults. The essential oils of Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) have less empirical support but continue to be widely recommended by aromathera-pists as sleep aids for children. Among traditional herbalists, chamomile tea has an ancient history of use as a soporific for both adults and children. It has been found that apeginin, a component of German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) , binds to central ben- zodiazepine receptors (GABAA receptors) (9), thus at least partially accounting for the anxiolytic and seda-tive effects of the tea. However, apigenin is a bioflavi-noid and is not found in the essential oil so generaliz- ing about the sleep-promoting effects of chamomile essential oil based on the actions of the herbal tea of chamomile is not warranted, although there may be other components in the essential oil that promote sleep. In my own clinical experience with school age children and adolescents I have seen good results in address-ing mild and sometimes moderate sleep disorders using a combination of essential oils, behavioral inter-ventions and good sleep hygiene. The essential oil intervention that I have found to be most consistently successful has been lavender ( Lavandula angustifo- lia) combined with sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis). Although children seem to especially like the aroma of sweet orange, perhaps because it's familiar, I have personally not found it to be as useful alone as it is in combination with lavender. Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) is another essential oil that I have sometimes used with success but, in general, I have found chamomile tea to be more effective. The drawback to using a tea at bedtime is that it can possi-bly cause a child to wake out of need to empty their bladder. I have found inhalation of essential oils to be the easiest method and for a child, I generally put one or two drops of lavender or lavender/sweet orange blend on the pad of a small, quiet fan diffuser placed near the bed. Foot, hand and arm massage with 1 or 2 drops of lavender or lavender/sweet orange blend in two teaspoons of a vegetable oil, such as grapeseed oil, is also good and sometimes more effective.

This is a particularly important issue when using lavender since this essential oil loses its relaxing effects when more than about 4 drops are used (possibly even less with young children) and too much lavender essential oil can cause restlessness and insomnia. The issue of how long one should use an essential oil or essential oil blend is another point to consider and this is an area of debate among aromatherapists. Some aromatherapists feel that any given essential oil or blend should not be used for more than three weeks without a break while others have reported considerably longer periods of use with no ill effects and no decrease in efficacy. I have found that, in most cases, if you can achieve an improve- ment in sleep that continues for two or three weeks you can and should begin to decrease and ultimately withdraw the essential oil while maintaining appropri-ate sleep hygiene and other behavioral measures. I have also observed that as sleep improves after a few trials with essential oil, a behavioral conditioning may occur so that the aroma then has the ability to elicit sleep despite any physiological effects of sedation that are inherent in the components of that essential oil. When this type of conditioning occurs then a signifi-cantly lower \"dose\" of the essential oil may have the desired effect. Since behavioral conditioning actually occurs rather easily with aromas, you can even pair the delivery of the essential oil with a neutral stimulus that can later be used to evoke sleepiness in the total absence of the essential oil. However, appropriate use of this latter type of behavioral conditioning requires some skill and knowledge and is best attempted by someone with training in the technique. In some cases there may be interactive effects between essential oils and pharmacological medica-tions and unless you are a physician or are consulting closely with a child's physician, the safest approach is to avoid the use of essential oils wtih children taking medications. Finally, I have found that although behavioral interven- tions are often very effective in and of themselves for reducing sleep problems, especially in younger children, they are often initially very stressful for parents and children alike. The use of essential oils as described above, especially in conjunction with parent-administered massage, appears to make such interventions more palatable for both the child and the parents and therefore more likely to succeed. All of these potential benefits of aromatherapy are achieved with very little risk of side effects. Allergic reactions to chamomile can occur and are most likely in children and adolescents with known allergies to other members of the Asteraceae family, such as ragweed. Skin irritation (dermatitis) occurs occasion-ally with topical use of sweet orange oil. 1. Owens, J. A. et al.

The treatment of chemotherapy can cause nausea, pain and anxiety. In January of 2010, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio began an aromatherapy program for oncology patients while in the hospital. Patients receiving chemotherapy, radiation or surgery to treat their cancer are given the opportunity to use essential oils to help control pain and reduce anxiety along with massage therapy. The oils are added to a massage lotion and applied topically to the skin. They are also put on a cotton ball in a cup to be inhaled as desired. Aromatherapy used as an enhancement to Massage Therapy includes one drop of essential oil placed in 4oz. of jojoba or unscented lotion and massaged into the patient's skin. The therapist may put one drop of diluted essential oil on his/her hands for the patient to inhale before beginning the massage. The patient may also have a \"whif cup\": which is one drop of oil on a cotton ball in a cup with a tight lid. The patient has the option of leaving it open or using it only as desired. All oils that are used are high quality, organic, therapeutic essential oils. The patient may choose one of 3 oils: lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), for its balancing prosperities and ability to help anxious patients wind down, orange (Citris sinensis), because it can lift the spirit while providing a calming influence to the mind and body, and peppermint (Mentha piperita), with a clean fresh aroma that aids digestion and may soothe nausea. Of the 23 patients surveyed, 35% choose orange, 30% picked lavender and 20% choose peppermint. Another 5% chose a mix of 2 of the oils. All of the patients who choose an essential oil had a positive experience. Patients who were readmitted to the hospital at a later date always requested aroma- therapy again. 3 patients declined aromatherapy due to their previous unpleasant exposure to commercial scented candles and air fresheners. No negative or undesirable reactions were reported by those who participated in aromatherapy. Patient responses to the aromatherapy massage sessions were collected. An anxiety scale was used to measure anxiety levels. Patients rated the follow statements with a scale of 1-4 with one being none of the time, to four, most or all of the time. I feel calm and can sit still easily. My hands are usually warm and dry. I fall asleep easily and get a good night's sleep. I feel that everything is alright and nothing bad will happen.All scores went down after aromatherapy massage, indicating that anxiety was relieved at least somewhat. The higher the anxiety level the more it changed with the use of aromatherapy. All anxiety levels decreased or remained the same. While anxiety levels were the primary focus of the results, patients have also reported decreased nausea with the use of aromatherapy. 40% of the patients reported decreased nausea while using the essential oils. They also reported that while orange or lavender helped, peppermint decreased their nausea the most. One 15 year old patient would become so nauseated even before admission that he would vomit in the parking garage before treatment started. His Mom felt that the aromatherapy assisted in decreasing his anxiety and nausea. Patients also reported decreased pain levels, but it was difficult to track the effect of aromatherapy accurately due to patients receiving pain medications as well as massage with the oils. All of these patients have central lines through which medications are given and blood samples are drawn. These lines are routinely flushed with a saline solution which causes an unpleasant salt taste and can be anxiety and nausea provoking to some children. Continued...page 46\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 46Aromatherapy for Children and Teens in the Hospital Setting Peg Noonan, LMT Continued...page 45 An eleven year old patient discovered his own use for his whif cup. He found that if he inhaled from his peppermint wiffee cup during the line flush, he did not experience the unpleasant taste! His family and medical staff were very impressed with his creativity and his ability to stay calm and comfortable. This is the beginning stage of aromatherapy use at Nationwide Children's Hospital. To date, we have had no adverse effects from incorporating aromatherapy into our massage therapy program and have had only positive feedback from the patients, family and staff.As a Licensed Mas- sage Therapist, Peg Noonan has had a private practice since 2001. Peg has ad- vanced training in Craniosacral Therapy, Manual Lymph Drain- age, Aromatherapy, Healing Touch, Neuro- muscular Therapy and Oncology Massage. She has also worked in sports massage, hospital based massage, and in the Spa Industry. Peg has volunteered at a Women's Shelter and taught infant massage to teenage parents. Peg is involved in expanding the massage therapy program on the Oncology Unit at Nationwide Children's Hospital and bringing massage therapy into the detox and eating disorder programs. Margaret.Noonan@nationwidechildrens.org \u00a9C \u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 47Hospice Pediatrics Lisa M. Browder, ICA, CR, RA I'll be honest -- pediatric care makes me a little nervous. Most of the available literature on pediatrics deals with common childhood issues. Although other hospices are using essential oils effectively for symptom management with their pediatric patients, there is no information-sharing network to allow us to work together, or even to know that others doing similar work exist. So I use the available literature on aromatherapy and childcare and then apply my own sleuthing technique: I quiz the nurses for relevant information on symptoms and their likely causes, determine whether it is an acute issue or an ongoing challenge, sort through essential oils that would be helpful, eliminate the ones I think might be too strong for the child's age and/or disease process, figure out what delivery method would be most effective and vary the dilution rate as necessary. These youngest hospice patients are rarely able to tell me how I am doing, so my assessment of success or failure has a different standard; it relies on nursing reports and visual cues such as a resolving skin issue, an unfurrowed brow, deeper sleep patterns; relief from constipation, or cessation of whimpering or crying. Our pediatric program manager identified the top five pediatric diagnoses as holoprosencephaly, neuro- degenerative disorders, severe cerebral palsy, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and chromosomal anomalies. Even pronouncing them is a challenge; they just sound scary. However, I have learned these formidable-sounding diagnoses have some common treatable symptoms, like constipation, irritability, skin issues and muscular aches. With holoprosencephaly, the lobes of the brain have failed to develop. These little ones suffer from mobility issues, seizures, visual and hearing disturbances, irritability, agitation and contractures. Our program manager says holoproscencephaly babies appear to be born more often to diabetic mothers. These babies do extremely well with specially-blended cr\u00e8mes for muscular aches and pains and agitation; each applied topically by our massage therapist. Additionally, in the acute-care units we diffuse lavender (Lavandula augustifolia) at bedside. Neurodegenerative disorders are particularly thorny and there are enough of them that many do not even have names. These children are normal at birth but somewhere between 5 and 10 years old begin to \"reverse,\" a condition distinguished by sudden tripping, falling and/or balance issues. They go on to develop spasticity and contractures. Many of these are older pediatric patients, so they may take a lot of pharmaceutical medications which can cause serious constipation. My formula to relieve this includes lavender, rosemary ct verbenone), ginger black pepper (Piper nigrum). Some of these children do well with a combination of essential oils and massage. Others will not tolerate touch. Since it is unpredictable, we usually send in the massage therapist with a topical cr\u00e8me to see how the child responds. One of our patients, a 17-year-old, only liked his head touched, so the massage therapist did cranial work with him. Another, a 9-year-old with Batten disease (a fatal, inherited disorder of the nervous system), responded extremely well to both Continued...page 48\u00a9 Copyright 2012 NAHA All rights reserved 48Continued...page 47 massage and reflexology and particularly loved the aromatherapy blends created for him. He was constantly restless and had frequent seizure activity. When the inhaler stick created for his breathing was held up to his nose, his movements ceased and he would inhale, deeply and audibly. The inhaler contained peppermint (Mentha x piperita). Severe cerebral palsy is frequently accompanied by other diagnoses so there may be multiple symptoms to sort out. These children show a loss of mobility and lose the ability to speak. Their muscle control is affected and they often have scoliosis and contractures. They benefit from a combination of massage and essential oils. We use a topical blend of lavender, rosemary, juniper (Juniperus communis), black pepper, fennel and peppermint. These patients may not be able to speak, but the essential oils still affect emotional centers so we frequently see a softening of facial features accompanied by soft sounds that the mothers identify as pleasure reactions. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is due to a lack of oxygen to the brain and most commonly occurs during the birth process. The affected part of the brain dies, dissolves and becomes fluid on the brain. Vision and hearing are affected and these babies suffer from contractures and spasticity. We worked with a 27-week-old baby that would only allow our massage therapist (not even his mother) to touch his feet. She used a lavender cr\u00e8me applied topically to help him relax. Then there are the babies born with chromosomal anomalies such as Trisomy 18 or Trisomy 13. These diseases involve an extra copy of a numbered chromosome rather than the normal two sets and the extra material interferes with normal development. According to the National Institute of Health, these children may have clenched hands, crossed legs, low-set ears, mental retardation and sometimes a cleft lip or palate. They will frequently have clenched fingers and, as our nurse told me, they \"usually just require a relaxing environment.\" They are good candidates for a bedside diffuser and/or hand massage with a lavender cr\u00e8me. I was recently asked to blend something for one of our patients with an unidentified skin issue. Tiny blister-like raised areas appear, open up, scab over and eventually disappear. The child does not appear uncomfortable and no pattern has emerged to identify a possible source. Even a dermatologist has been unable to identify the issue. I made a .5 percent formulation in grape seed oil (Vitis vinifera) of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) and Roman chamomile and suggested massaging a small amount into the affected areas after his bath. I chose the tea tree for its antifungal/ antibacterial/anti-infectious properties, chamomile for inflammation, and sweet orange primarily for aroma. There has been a marked improvement, with the spots healing rapidly. One of the nurses told me, \"It looks like someone vacuumed his skin.\" The majority of my blends are between .5-1 percent but I have also used a 2 percent constipation blend and a 3 percent blend for dry/patchy skin. There have been no negative results reported. To the contrary, many of the stronger blends have been the most successful and in the shortest amount of time. So although some of the diagnoses in pediatric hospice sound daunting, my experience has been nothing but positive. These smallest of our patients with their life-limiting illnesses respond exceedingly well (and quickly) to essential oils.
