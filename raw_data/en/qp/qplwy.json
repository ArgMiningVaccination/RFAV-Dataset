A public health-protective approach in developing a Health- based MCL based on animal toxicology data is supported by associations of PFOA with a number of health effects in the general population and communities with drinking water exposure, as well as PFOA's biological persistence and bioaccumulation from drinking water in humans. PFOA was described as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board, \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and as having \"suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential\" by the USEPA Office of Water. Both non- carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects were evaluated for Health -based MCL development. D elayed mammary gland development and increased liver weight were the most sensitive non- carcinogenic endpoints with data n eeded for dose- response modeling. For each of these endpoints, benchmark dose modeling of serum PFOA levels from mouse studies was performed and appropriate uncertainty factors were applied to develop a Target Human Serum Level (analogous to a Reference D ose but on a serum level basis). A clearance factor (1.4 x 10 -4 L/kg/ day) which relates serum PFOA concentrations to human PFOA doses was applied to the Target Human Serum Levels to develop Reference Doses. For delayed mammary gland development, t he Target Human Serum Level is 0.8 ng/ml, which is below the median serum PFOA level in the U.S. general population. The Reference Dose for this endpoint is 0.11 ng/kg/day. Because the use of delayed mammary gland development as the basis for quantitative risk assessment is a currently developing topic , a Health -based MCL using this endpoint as its primary basis was not recommended. However, it was concluded that an uncertainty factor for sensitive endpoints is needed to protect for this and other effects that occur at similarly low doses. A Health -Based MCL protective for increased relative liver weight was derived based on a study in which male mice were exposed to PFOA for 14 days. For increased relative liver weight, t he Target Human Serum Level is 14.5 ng/ml and the Reference Dose is 2 ng/kg/day. This Target Human Serum Level and Reference Dose incorporate uncertainty f actors to protect sensitive human subpopulations, to account for toxicodynamic differences between human and experimental animals, and to protect for more sensitive endpoints that occur from developmental exposures (delayed mammary gland development, persistent hepatic toxicity , and others). Default values for drinking water exposure assumptions (2 L/day water consumption; 70 kg bod y weight) and Relative Source Contribution factor (20%) were used to develop a Health -based MCL of 14 ng/L was based on the Reference Dose for increased relative liver weight. A cancer slope factor of 0.021 (mg/kg/day)-1 was developed based on increased incidence of testicular tumors in a chronic rat study. This slope factor was used to develop a Health- based MCL protective for cancer effects at the 1 x 10-6 (one in one million) lifetime cancer risk level of 14 ng/L, identical to the Health -based MCL based on non-cancer endpoints. The recommended Health -based MCL is therefore 14 (0.014 \u00b5g/L). 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, C8) is a member of the group of substances called perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), chemicals that contain a totally fluorinated carbon chain which varies in length and a functional group such as carboxylic or sulfonic acid. P FCs are part of a larger group of chemicals called poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute (DWQI) voted to pursue development of a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) recommendation for PFOA on January 27, 2009 based on its potential health effects and its occurrence in New Jersey public water supplies (PWS). The Health Effects Subcommittee began its evaluation of PFOA during 2009-2010, but a Health- based MCL recommendation was not finalized at that time. A review of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant was subsequently published by several current and former Subcommittee members in 2012 (Post et al., 2012). On March 21, 2014, New Jersey DEP Commissioner Bob Martin requested that the DWQI recommend an MCL for PFOA and two perfluorooctane sulfonic evaluation and recommended Health -based MCL for PFOA are presented in this document. As is the case for Health -based MCLs recommended by the DWQI in general, the recommended Health -based MCL for PFOA is based on the goals specified in the 1984 Amendments to the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) at N.J.S.A. 58:12A- 20. This statute specifies a one in one million (10 -6) risk of cancer from lifetime exposure to carcinogens, and that no \"adverse physiological effects\" are expected to result from lifetime ingestion for non - carcinogenic effects. Human health risk assessment approaches used by the DWQI to develop Health -based MCLs generally follow USEPA risk assessment guidance. Manufacturing and Use Because carbon -fluorine bonds are among the strongest found in organic chemistry, PFOA and other PFCs are extremely stable and resistant to chemical reactions. PFOA has been produced for use in commercial products and industrial processes for over 60 years. Its unique surfactant properties and resistance to chemical and thermal degradation make it useful in many applications including water-, soil-, and stain- resistant coatings, fire-fighting foams, and industrial uses. Large amounts of PFOA were used industrially as a processing aid (emulsifier) in the production of fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers for use as non- stick coatings. Because of concerns about its ubiquitous presence in environmental media (including wildlife) and human blood serum worldwide, its persistent and bioaccumulative nature, and its potential health effects, the eight major U.S. producers of PFOA entered into a voluntary agreement with USEPA in 2006 to reduce emissions and product content of PFOA and its precursors by 95% by 2010 and to work towards eliminating them by 2015. However, other manufacturers and users of PFOA that are not participants in the voluntary agreement with USEPA continue to emit large 3 amounts of PFOA to the environment, particularly overseas. Although the production and use of PFOA and its precursors has been phased out by major U.S. m anufacturers, environmen tal contam ination and resulting human exposure to PFOA are anticipated to conti nue for the foreseeable future due to its persistence, formation from precursor compounds , and continued production by other m anufacturers . Environmental Fate and Transport Because of the extreme stability of their c arbonfluorine bonds, PFOA and other PFCs are extremely resistant to degradation in the environment and thus persist indefinitely. PFOA and other PFCs are found in many environmental media and in wildlife worldwide including in remote polar regions. PFOA is much less bioaccumulative in fish than PFOS or perfluorinated carboxylates with more than eight carbons , and PFOA concentrations in wildlife are generally lower than for these other PFCs. PFOA and other PFCs can be taken up into plants from contaminated soil or irrigation water. In general, PFOA and other longer chain PFCs are preferentially taken up into the root and shoot parts of the plant. P FOA and some other PFCs are distinctive from other persistent and bioaccumulative organic compounds because of their importance as drinking water contaminants. PFOA does not bind well to soil, migrates readily from soil to ground water, and is highly wat er-soluble. These properties of PFOA differ from those of other well-known persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants such as polychlorinated dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) that have a high affinity for soil and sediments but low wate r solubility. P FOA that is released into the environment can contaminate surface water and groundwater used as drinking water sources . Environmental sources include industrial discharge to soil, air, and water; release of aqueous firefighting foams; dispo sal in landfills; wastewater treatment plant discharge; street and storm water runoff; and land application of biosolids, industrial solid waste, and wastewater. PFOA also enters the environment through the breakdown of precursor compounds such as the fluorotelomer alcohol 8:2 FTOH and larger molecules that can release 8:2 FTOH. These precursor compounds are used industrially and in consumer products. They are converted to PFOA by microbes in soil, sludge, and wastewater and through atmospheric chemical reactions. As is the case for other ground water contaminants, PFOA can reach drinking water wells via migration of a ground water plume. Unlike many other environmental contaminants, PFOA emitted to air from industrial facilities can also contaminate distant groundwater wells through air transport, followed by deposition from air onto soil, and migration through the soil to groundwater. 4 Occurrence in Drinking Water PFOA and other PFCs are not effectively removed from drinking water by standard treatment processes but can be removed from drinking water by granular activated carbon (GAC) or reverse osmosis. Therefore, unless specific treatment for removal of PFCs is in place, concentrations of PFOA detected in raw drinking water can be considered to be re presentative of concentrations in finished drinking water. The occurrence of PFOA and other PFCs in public water supplies (PWS) has been evaluated more extensively in New Jersey than in most or all other states. More than 1,000 samples from 80 NJ PWS we re analyzed with relatively low Reporting Levels (RLs; generally < 5 ng/L ) in 2006-2016. PFOA was the most frequently detected PFC and was found in samples from approximately 60% of the 80 NJ PWS tested. In the 2013-2015 USEPA Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 3 (UCMR3) survey of all large (>10,000 users) and a subset of smaller PWS in the U.S. , PFOA was detected more than five times more frequently in New Jersey PWS (10.5%) than nationally (1.9%). The RL in UCMR3 was 20 ng/L, much higher than the RLs for most other NJ PWS monitoring. PFOA has also been detected in NJ private wells near sources of industrial discharge. Human Biomonitoring PFOA and other PFCs are found ubiquitously in the blood serum of the general population in the U.S. and worldwide. The most recent (2011-2012) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative sample survey of the U.S. general population conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), determined the geometric mean and 95 th percentile serum PFOA concentrations as 2.08 and 5.68 ng/ml, respectively. Serum PFOA levels in the U.S. general population have declined since the first NHANES monitoring in 1999- 2000 when the g eometric mean and 95th percentile values were 5.21 and 11.9 ng/ml. In communities exposed through contaminated drinking water, serum PFOA levels are elevated compared to the general population. Exposures to industrial ly-exposed workers or others with occup ational exposure are much higher than in the general population. Serum PFOA concentrations of greater than 100,000 ng/ml (100 ppm) have been reported in industrially exposed workers, although levels in most workers were lower. Sources of Exposure Sources of exposure to PFOA and/or its precursors include drinking water, food and food packaging, treated fabrics, protective sprays and waxes, cosmetics and personal care products, house dust, and inhalation of indoor and outdoor air. Most studies predic t that food and food packaging are the predominant exposure sources, and several studies suggest that PFOA and its precursors in indoor air and/or house dust can be a major exposure source. It should be noted that migration of PFOA from polytetrafluoroeth ylene (PTFE) -coated non-stick cookware into food is not considered to be a significant source of exposure. The contribution of ingested drinking water to total exposure from all sources (e.g. diet, consumer products, etc.) is dependent 5 on the concentration of PFOA in the drinking water, and relatively low concentrations in water substantially increase human body burden. I nhalation from showering, bathing, laundry, and dishwashing, and dermal absorption during showering, bathing, or swimming, are not expected to be significant sources of exposure from contaminated drinking water. E xposures to PFOA may be higher in young children than in older individuals because of age- specific behaviors such as greater drinking water and food consumption on a body weight basis, hand- to-mouth behavior resulting in greater ingestion of house dust, and more time spent on floors where treated carpets are found. Toxicokinetics PFOA is well absorbed orally , and it was also absorbed dermally and by inhalation in toxicological studies. It is water soluble and distributes primarily to the liver and serum, and, to a lesser degree, to the kidney. Unlike most other bioaccumulative organic compounds, it does not distribute to fat. In the serum, PFOA is almost totally bound to albumin and other proteins. Since it is chemically non -reactive, it is not metabolized. The rate of excretion is largely dependent on the extent of secretion and reabsorption by organic anion transporters in the kidney. The excretion rate varies widely among species, and in some cases between males and females of the same species. PFOA's half -life in humans is several years and is similar in males and females. Because of its long half- life, it remains in the human body for many years after exposures cease. PFOA is persistent in both male and female mice and in male rats, with half -lives of days to weeks. However, PFOA is rapidly excreted in female rats (half -life of 2-4 hours); thus, this species is not an ideal model for studying potential human developm ental effects. Because of the large variation in half- lives, the internal dose resulting from a given administered dose varies widely among species and, in some cases, genders of the same species. For this reason, interspecies (e.g. animal -to-human) comparisons are made on the basis of internal dose, as indicated by serum level, rather than administered dose. Relationship between drinking water exposure and human serum levels Data from communities with contaminated drinking water indicate that ongoing hum an exposure to PFOA in drinking water increases serum levels, on average, by at least 100 times the drinking water concentration. A human clearance factor for PFOA of 1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day was developed by USEPA researchers (Lorber and Egeghy, 2011) to relate serum PFOA concentration to administered dose. Assuming an average U.S. daily water consumption rate, the clearance factor predicts a serum:drinking water ratio of 114:1, consistent with the ratios that have been observed in exposed communities. C ontinued exposure to even low drinking water concentrations results in substantially increased serum PFOA levels. Based on the clearance factor, each 10 ng/L in drinking water is predicted 6 to increase serum PFOA by 1.1 ng/ ml with an average water consum ption rate, and 2.0 ng/ ml with an upper percentile water consumption rate. These increases in serum PFOA from drinking water can be compared to the most recent NHANES geometric mean, PFOA level s predicted from average and upper percentile drinking water consumption at various drinking water PFOA concentrations are shown in Figure E -1. Figure E-1. Increases in serum PFOA concentrations predicted from mean and upper percentile consumption of drinking water with various concentrations of PFOA, as compared to U.S median and 95th percentile serum PFOA levels (NHANES, 2011 -12). Exposures to infants In humans, PFOA has been measured in amniotic fluid, maternal serum, u mbilical cord blood, and breast milk. Serum PFOA concentrations in infants at birth are similar to those in maternal serum. Both breast -fed infants whose mothers ingest contaminated drinking water and infants fed with formula prepared with contaminated dr inking water receive much greater exposures to PFOA than older individuals who consume drinking water with the same PFOA concentration. PFOA exposure in breast -fed infants is greatest during the first few months of life because both PFOA concentrations in breast milk and the rate of fluid consumption are highest then. As a result, serum PFOA concentrations in breast -fed infants increase several fold from levels at birth within the first few months of life (Figure E -2). Exposures to infants who consume for mula prepared with contaminated water are also highest during this time period. While serum PFOA levels peak during the first year of life, they remain elevated for several years. These elevated 7 exposures during infancy and early childhood are of particul ar concern because early life effects are sensitive endpoints for the toxicity of PFOA. Figure E -2. From Verner et al.

Health Effects Because the scientific database related to health effects of PFOA is very large, the Subcommittee focused its evaluation on specific endpoints from human and animal studies. Relevant studies were identified through literature searches of the PubMed database, from earlier evaluations of PFOA by the Health Effects Subcommittee, and through backwards searching. Epidemiology The choice of endpoints selected for comprehensive review from epidemiology studies was largely based on knowledge gained from previous evaluations by the Subcommittee. Health endpoints evaluated comprehensively were serum cholesterol/lipids, liver enzymes/bilirubin and liver disease, uric acid, thyroid function and thyroid disease, and antibody concentrations following vaccination. In total, 54 epidemiological studies were evaluated in depth, including studies from the general population, com munities with drinking water exposures including most notably the C8 Health Study - a large study of about 70,000 Ohio and West Virginia residents exposed to a wide range of PFOA concentrations (>50 ng/L to over 3000 ng/L) in drinking water , and occupation ally exposed workers. Recent comprehensive reviews by other authoritative scientific groups were evaluated for two additional critical endpoints, fetal growth following developmental exposure and cancer. O f the endpoints that were evaluated comprehensivel y, the evidence for associations with PFOA was strongest for increases in serum levels of cholesterol, the liver enzyme ALT, and uric acid. 8 PFOA w as associated w ith cl inically de fined hypercholesterolemia in a community exposed through drinking water. The epidemiological evi dence supports m ultiple criteria for a causal relationship between PFOA and both serum cholesterol and ALT . Notably, the steepest dose- response for associations with these endpoints was within the range of serum P FOA concentrations found in the general popul ation and communities with drinking water exposures, with a much flatter curve at higher serum concentrations. For some other endpoints that were comprehensively reviewed, limited evidence of an association with PFOA was found. Althou gh there is cons istent evidence of de creased antibody concentrations following vaccination, most of the vaccine types were evaluated in only one or two studies. Other endpoints with limited e vidence of an association include LDL, the liver enzymes GGT and AST, bilirubin, liver disease, and thyroid disease. There was limited or no evidence of association of PFOA with TSH and thyroid hormones, and no evidence for association with HDL or the liver enzyme ALP. A systematic review using the Navigation Guide methodology concluded that there is \"sufficient\" human evidence, the strongest descriptor for strength of evidence, that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth (e.g. birth weight) in humans (Johnson et al., 2015). The Health Effects Subcommittee found that the basis for this conclusion is reasonable and supportable. M aternal glomerular f iltration rate (GFR) w as evaluated as a potential confounding factor for this effect, and it was concluded that decreased GFR does not account for the major portion of the decrease in f etal g rowth as sociated with P FOA. PFOA w as associated w ith increased i ncidenc e of testicular and kidney cancer i n com munities with drinking water exposure. T hese studies account ed for smoking history and other relevant factors. The USEPA SAB (2006) described P FOA as \"l ikely to be carcinogenic to hum ans.\" based on the criteria provided in USEPA (2005b) cancer risk as sessment guidance. M ore recently , IARC (2015) concluded that PFOA is possibly carcinogenic to humans, and the USEPA O ffice of Wate r (2016a ) described it as having suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential. Although the magnitude of change for some of the parameters as sociated with P FOA w as relatively s mall, the y are of public health concer n because popul ation- level changes of this magnitude will result in a shift in the overall distribution of values such that the number of individuals w ith clinically abnormal values is inc reased. Additionally, s mall changes in a clinical biomarker m ay be an i ndicator of ot her effects that were not evaluated. For example, relatively small decreases in birth weight may be an indication of changes in other more subtle developmental pa rameters w hich w ere not assessed. In summary, associations of PFOA with numerous health endpoints have been found in human populations with evidence supporting c riteria for causality for some endpoints . These health endpoints include non-carcinogenic effects in the general popul ation, and both non- carcinogenic 9 effects and cancer in communities with drinking water exposure. The epidemiologic data for PFOA are notable because of the consistency between results among human epidemiologic studies in different populations, the concordance with to xicological findings from experimental animals, the use of serum concentrations as a measure of internal exposure, the potential clinical importance of the endpoints for which associations are observed, and the observation of associations within the exposure range of the general population. These features of the epidemiologic data distinguish PFOA from most other organic drinking water contaminants and justify concerns about exposures to PFOA through drinking water. Although there is evidence to support causality for some epidemiological endpoints, the human data have limitations and therefore are not used as the quantitative basis for the Health -based MCL. Instead, the potential Health -based MCLs developed below are based on sensitive and well established animal toxicology endpoints that are considered relevant to humans based on mode of action data. Toxicology The toxicological database for PFOA includes evaluation of numerous effects in non-human primates and rodents. The Health Effects Subcommittee's review focused on endpoints that were identified as sensitive and potentially appropriate for use in risk asse ssment. The effects selected for detailed review were hepatic toxicity, developmental effects, immune system toxicity, and carcinogenicity. As discussed above, effects relevant to these endpoints have been associated with PFOA in human epidemiological studies. Additionally, information is presented on general toxicity in non-human primates, as well as thyroid, neurobehavioral, and male reproductive effects. T he non- human primate studies have limitations that preclude their consideration as the basis fo r risk assessment. These include very small numbers of animals, severe toxicity at the lowest dose, loss of animals during the study due to toxicity and/or mortality, and lack of dose-response for key endpoints (e.g. increased liver weight). I ncreased liver weight is a sensitive toxicological endpoint for PFOA which has been observed in many studies in both non-human primates and rodents. Increased liver weight can co- occur with and/or progress to more severe hepatic effects including hepatocellular necrosis, fatty liver, increased serum liver enzymes, and hyperplastic nodules. Recent studies show that developmental exposure to low doses of PFOA in mice causes cellular changes indicative of liver toxicity that persist until adulthood. R eproductive or developmental effects of PFOA have not been studied in non-human primates. The mouse is an appropriate species for evaluating effects on reproduction and development since the female mouse excretes PFOA slowly, as do humans. In contrast, rats and rabbi ts are not ideal models for studying these effects because they excrete PFOA very quickly, with a half - life of a few hours. Effects from developmental exposures in mice include full litter resorptions, 10 decreased postnatal survival and growth, delayed devel opment, accelerated sexual maturation in males , persistent liver toxicity (noted above), and delayed mammary gland development. P FOA also causes reproductive toxicity in male mice. Delayed m ammary gland development and persistent liver tox icity after p erinatal (prenatal and/or neonatal) exposure are sensitive endpoints which occur in mice at l ower dos es of PFOA than other developmental effects. D elayed m ammary gland development has been reported in nine separate studies presented in five publications, while only one study which has several general problematic is sues di d not find this effect. Gestational and/or lactational exposures to PFOA caused delayed mammary gland development in pregnant dams and/or female offspring in two strains of mice. Histological changes in the mammary gland of exposed offspring occurred in a dose-related f ashion, persisted until adulthood, and were considered permanent. However, available toxicological information is not su fficien t to make conclusions about the effects o f PFOA on lactational function. Maternal PFOA exposure was associated with shorter breastfeeding in the three human st udies that evaluated this effect, and there is no information indicating that the histological changes observed in mice are not relevant to humans. Additional studies evaluated effects of peripubertal (around the time of puberty) exposure on mammary gland development i n mice. Thes e studies cannot be directly compared to studies of perinatal exposure because effects on mammary gland development differ depending on the lifestage when exposure occurs. Additionally, interpretation of the peripubertal studies is problematic because eac h PFOA dose level was used in only one study in each of the strains of mice evaluated, such t hat dos e-response interpretations can only be made b y combining data from different studies. PFOA suppressed the immune system in studies of rhesus monkeys and m ice. D ecreased bone marrow cellularity and lymphoid atrophy occurred in monkeys, while effects in mice included decreased spleen and thymus weights, decreased thymocyte and splenocyte counts, decreased immunoglobulin response, and changes in total numbers and/or specific populations of lymphocytes. Immune system effects were not observed in two rat studies which included doses higher t han t hose which generally c aused t hese effects i n mice. Review of the toxicological d ata indicates t hat increased l iver weight is an endpoint that is as sensitive or more s ensitive than immune system toxicity or reproductive/developmental effects, with the exception of delayed mammary gland development. PFOA caus ed tumors of the liver, pa ncreatic acinar cel ls, and t esticular Leydig cells in ma le rats. Since PFOA i s rapidly ex creted b y femal e rats, chr onic studies i n anot her s pecies i n which PFOA is persistent in both sexes, such as the mouse, would provide important information 11 specific to females. A recent study suggests that prenatal exposure to PFOA in mice caused an increased incidence of liver tumors. However, this study was not designed as a carcinogenicity bioassay and does not provide definitive information on this issue. Additional research on carcinogenicity later in life after developmental exposures to PFOA is needed. Mode of Action The mode(s) of action of PFOA have not been fully characterized. Based on the information reviewed by the Health Effects Subcommittee, the toxicological effects of PFOA are generally considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. P FOA is not chemically reactive. Th us, it is not metabolized to reactive intermediates and does not covalently bind to nucleic acids and proteins. Consistent with these properties, available data indicate that it is not genotoxic. Activation of nuclear receptors and r ole of PPAR -alpha Effects of PFOA occur through multiple modes of action including activation of receptor s that control the expression of genes involved in many biological pathways . Much attention has been focused on the potential human relevance of effects that occur through activation of the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor -alpha (PPAR -alpha). This question PPAR -alpha activat ing compounds cause rodent liver tumors; the human relevance of these tumors is subject to debate due to lower levels and/or differences in intrinsic activity of PPAR -alpha in human liver. However, the uncertainty about human relevance does not necessarily apply to PPAR-alpha mediated effects other than liver tumors. Both human and mouse PPAR- alpha are activated by PFOA in vitro , and the results do not clearly indicate that human PPAR-alpha is less sensitive than rodent PPAR- alpha in these in vitro systems. Hepatic effects Studies of non-human primates, standard strains of rats and mice, PPAR -alpha null mice , and humanized PPAR- alpha mice support the conclusion that hepatic effects of PFOA are relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. As noted above, PFOA is associated with increased liver enzymes in human epidemiol ogical studies. I n a subchronic study of cynomolgus monkeys, a species in which human relevance of hepatic effects is not in question, PFOA caused increased liver weight and peroxisomal proliferating activity similar in magnitude to that seen in rats, demonstrating that hepatic PPAR -alpha activity in response to PFOA is not limited to rodents . In this study, several animals exhibited notably increased liver weight, highly elevated serum liver enzymes , and/or severe hepatic toxicity. O bservations in standard strains of laboratory rodents indicate that PFOA causes PPAR- alpha independent hepatic effects in rodents with normal PPAR-alpha function. In these strains, 12 increased relative liver weight caused by PFOA did not directly correspo nd with hepatic peroxisome proliferating activity. Additionally, PFOA caused fatty liver in these standard strains, although PPAR-alpha activation decreases hepatic lipids. Finally, developmental exposure to PFOA caused abnormal mitochondria in livers of a standard mouse strain, with no evidence of peroxisome proliferation. P FOA caused decreased serum lipids, typically associated with PPAR -alpha activation, in rodents, while increased serum lipids are associated with PFOA exposure in humans. Recent studies suggest that these differences may be related to the low fat diet generally used in laboratory rodent studies versus the higher fat content of a typical Westernized human diet, rather than solely to interspecies differences. S tudies comparing wild type (with normal PPAR -alpha) and PPAR-alpha null (lacking PPAR- alpha) mice provide further evidence that hepatic effects occur through both PPAR -alpha dependent and independent pathways. PFOA caused similar increases in liver weight in wild type and PPAR-alpha null strains. Increased liver enzymes and histopathological changes, particularly damage to the bile duct, also occurred in PFOA -treated PPAR -alpha null mice. Additionally, developmental exposures to PPAR- alpha null mice caused persistent histopathological changes in the liver. S tudies of strains of mice which express human PPAR-alpha in the liver (humanized PPAR- alpha mice) indicate that PFOA causes hepatic effects through activation of human PPAR -alpha. In humanized PPAR- alpha mice, PFOA caused increased liver weight similar to th at in wild type mice, activation of hepatic genes associated with PPAR -alpha, and histopathological changes in the liver. Fetal liver weight was increased similarly in wild type and humanized PPAR -alpha mice after in utero exposure, and expression of genes associated with PPAR- alpha in fetal liver was increased to a greater degree in humanized PPAR- alpha mice than in wild type mice. Immune system effects PFOA suppresses the immune system in both non-human primates and mice . As noted above, decreased response to vaccinations has been associated with PFOA in human epidemiological studies. Data from mouse studies indicate that these effects on the immune system occur through both PPAR- alpha dependen t and independent modes of action. Both PPAR-alpha dependent and independent effects on the immune system are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Developmental and reproductive effects As noted above, decreased fetal growt h is associated with PFOA in human epidemiological studies. Developmental effects of PFOA in rodents appear to occur primarily through PPAR-alpha dependent mechanisms, while some reproductive effects such as full litter resorptions 13 appear to be PPAR -alpha independent. PPAR -alpha and other PPARs are present in human fetal tissues and are expected to have important roles in reproduction and development. Therefore, PPAR -alpha mediated effects of PFOA on development are considered relevant to humans for the p urposes of risk assessment. Toxicity to the placenta may play a role in PFOA's developmental effects such as fetal growth retardation ; more research is needed on this question. D elayed mammary gland development after developmental exposure is a sensitive endpoint for PFOA toxicity in mice. The rodent is considered a good model for human mammary gland development, and there is no mode of action evidence suggesting that the effects of PFOA on this endpoint are not relevant to humans. P FOA also causes male reproductive toxicity in mice, and there is no mode of action information to suggest that these effects are not relevant to humans. Carcinogenicity As noted above, PFOA has bee n associated with increased incidence of kidney and testicular cancer in communities exposed through drinking water after adjustment for smoking and other relevant factors . The USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006) concluded that the liver tumors caused by PFOA in rats are potentially relevant to humans, based on similarities in hepatic effects of PFOA in monkeys and rodents and the limited evidence available at the time on hepatic effects of PFOA in PPAR -alpha null mice. Subsequent studies in PPAR-alpha null mice have provided substantial additional relevant data. Importantly, hepatic cell proliferation, a causal event for tumor formation, is increased similarly by PFOA in wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice. Although a carcinogenicity bioassay of PFOA has not been conducted in PPAR- alpha null mice, a recent study suggests that developmental exposures to PFOA may cause hepatic tumors in adulthood in this strain. Finally, studies in rainbow trout, a species used as a model for human liver cancer because it lacks PPAR -alpha, suggest that PFOA causes liver tumors through an estrogenic mode of action. Th e mode of action for the testicular and pancreatic tumors caused by PFOA in rats has not been established . Therefore, they are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Additional modes of action A number of other modes of action for PFOA have been suggested including effects on intercellular gap junction communication, effects on mitochondria, changes in expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), and effects related to transporter proteins such as organic anion transporters (OATs) and multidrug resistance- associated proteins (MRPs). 14 Development of Recommended Health -based MCL Health -based MCLs developed by the DWQI are intended to be protective for chronic (lifetime) exposure through drinking water. The 1984 Amendments to the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water Act (N.J.S.A. 58:12A- 20) stipulate that Health -based MCLs be based on a one in one million lifetime cancer risk level for carcinogen s and no adverse effects from lifetime ingestion for non- carcinogens. PFOA was described as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board and \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) , and as having \"suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential \" by the USEPA Office of Water . As such, the Health Effects Subcommittee evaluated both non- carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects using approaches consistent with USEPA risk assessments guidance and previous risk assessments developed by NJDEP and the DWQI. B oth the human epidemiology data and the animal toxicology data were considered as part of the overall weight of evidence for the potential human health effects of PFOA. As discussed above, PFOA is associated with non-carcinogenic effects in the general population, and with both non- carcinogenic effects and cancer in communities with drinking water exposure. Although the data for some endpoints support multiple criteria for causality , the human epidemiology data have limitations and are therefore not used as the quantitative basis for the Health -based MCL. As such, the recommended Health -based MCL is based on sensitive and well established animal toxicology endpoints that are considered relevant to humans. Notwithstanding, the human data suggest that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that increase the risk of health effects, indicating a need for caution about exposures from drinking water. Therefore, the human epidemiological data support the use of a public health-protective approach in developing a Health- based MCL recommendation based on animal toxicology data. Health -based MCL based on non- carcinogenic effects Delayed mammary gland development and increased relative liver weight were identified as the most sensitive non-carcinogenic endpoints with data appropriate for dose-response modeling, and it was concluded that these endpoints are relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling of serum PFOA data from toxicological studies was performed to determine the BMDLs (lower 95% confidence limit on the doses corresponding to a minimal response) for the serum concentrations that are used as the points of departure (PODs) for these endpoints. Only studies that provide serum PFOA data were considered for dose- response modeling for these effects, since measured serum levels are associated with less uncertainty than serum level estimates from pharmacokinetic modeling or interspecies extrapolations based on half -life differences. 15 Effects on mammary gland development Delayed mammary gland development is the most sensitive systemic endpoint with data appropriate for dose-response modeling, and a Reference Dose (RfD) was developed for this endpoint. To the knowledge of the Health Effects Subcommittee, this endpoint has not previously been used as the primary basis for health-based drinking water concentrations or other human health criteria. Because the use of delayed mammary gland development as the basis for quantitative risk assessment is a currently developing topic , a Health -based MCL with this RfD as its primary basis was not recommended. However, it was concluded that an additional uncertainty factor (UF) should be incorporated into the RfD based on increas ed liver weight ( the endpoint used as the basis for the recommended Health- based MCL - see below) to protect for mammary gland effects, persistent liver toxicity, and other effects from developmental exposures at doses far below those that cause increased relative liver weight . A study of exposure to pregnant mice on days 10-17 of gestation (Macon et al., 2011) is the only developmental exposure study of mammary gland development that provides serum PFOA data appropriate for dose-response modeling. Of the multiple time points assessed in this study, delays in mammary gland development were most evident on postnatal day ( PND 21 ). Of the several endpoints related to mammary gland development that were evaluated, decreases in mammary gland developmental score and number of terminal end buds were selected for dose- response modeling because they showed a statistically significant dose -related decrease at PND 21.BMD m odeling was based on serum levels at PND 1, since t hey were higher at this time than at later time points. The serum concentration BMDLs for a 10% change in decreaseddevelopmental score and decreased number of terminal end buds were 24.9 and 22.9 ng/ml, respectively. A total UF of 30, including UFs of 10 for intra -human variability and 3 for animal- to-human toxicodynamic differences, was applied to the serum level BMDL for decreased number of terminal end buds, 22.9 ng/ml, to derive a Target Human Serum Level of 0.8 ng/ml. The typical UF of 3 for toxicokinetic variability between species is not included because the risk assessment is based on comparison of internal dose (serum levels) rather than administered dose. The Target Human Serum Level is analogous to a RfD in terms of internal, rather than administered, dose. This Target Human Serum Level for delayed mammary gland development of 0.8 ng/ml is below the median serum PFOA level in the U.S. general population (2.1 ng/ ml). The clearance factor mentioned above, 1.4 x 10 -4 L/kg/day, was applied to the Target Human Serum Level, 0.8 ng/ml, to calculate an RfD of 0.11 ng/kg/day. Hepatic effects Increased relative liver weight is a well -established effect of PFOA which is more sensitive than most other toxicological effects such as immune system toxicity and most 16 reproductive/developmental effects (Table 1 2 of Animal Toxicology section). The recommended Health -based MCL for non -carcinogenic effects is based on this endpoint. A study of male mice exposed to branched/linear PFO A for 14 days (Loveless et al., 2006) that showed a dose- related increase in relative liver weight was selected for dose-response modeling. This isomeric mixture is relevant to environmental contamination and human exposure, and it was used in almost all toxicological studies of PFOA. Because review of studies of increased relative liver weight indicated that the magnitude of this effect does not increase with exposure durations longer than 14 days, this study was considered to be of sufficient duration for use as the basis for a Health -based MCL. BMD modeling of the serum PFOA data from the study deter mined a serum level BMDL for a 10% increase in relative liver weight of 4350 ng/ml. A total UF of 300 was applied to the serum level BMDL of 4350 ng/ml to derive a Target Human Serum Level of 14.5 ng/ml. This UF includes UFs of 10 for intra-human variability, 3 for animal -to-human toxicodynamic differences, and 10 to protect more sensitive toxicological effects . These more sensitive effects , including delayed mammary gland development and hepatic toxicity after developmental exposures , occurred at doses 100-fold lower than the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) for increased li ver weight. Although the study duration was only 14 days and the Health -based MCL is intended to protect for chronic exposure, a UF for less -than-chronic duration of exposure was not applied because increased liver weight does not appear to increase in magnitude w hen exposures continue beyond two weeks. The clearance factor mentioned above, 1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day, was applied to the Target Human Serum Level, 14.5 ng/ml, to calculate an RfD of 2 ng/kg/day. Relative Source Contribution factor A Relative Sou rce Contribution (RSC) factor that accounts for non-drinking water sources including food, soil, air, water, and consumer products is used by USEPA, NJDEP, and the DWQI in the development of health-based drinking water concentrations based on non- carcinogenic effects. The default value for the RSC is 20%, meaning that 20% of total exposure is assumed to come from drinking water and 80% from non-drinking water sources. If supported by available data, a higher chemical -specific value (up to 80%) can be used (i.e. the percent exposure from non-drinking water sources is lower than the default assumption of 80%). T he Health Effects Subcommittee concluded that there are insufficient data to develop a chemical -specific RSC for PFOA. US EPA UCMR3 monitoring shows that PFOA occurs ( at concentrations greater than 20 ng/L ) more frequently in PWS located throughout New Jersey (10.5%) than nationwide (1.9%). T here are no New Jersey -specific biomonitoring data for PFOA, and the more frequent occurrence in NJ PWS suggests that New Jersey residents may also have higher exposures from non-drinking sources, such as contaminated soils, house dust, or other environmental media, 17 than the U.S. general population. Additionally, the default RSC of 20%, while not explicitly intended for this purpose, also partially accounts for the greater exposures to infants who are breast -fed or consume formula prepared with contaminated drinking water, as compared to older individuals. These higher exposures during infancy must be considered because short term exposures to infants are relevant to the effects of concern (delayed mammary gland development and increased relative liver weight). Therefore, the default RSC of 20% was used to develop the Health-based MCL. Health -based MCL based on non- carcinognic effects The Health -based MCL protective for increased liver weight, based on the RfD of 2 ng/kg/day, standard drinking water exposure assumptions (2 L/day water consumption; 70 kg body weight), and a 20% is 14 ng/L (0.014 g/L ). Health -based MCL based on carcinogenic effects Testicular tumor data from the chronic dietary exposure rat study (Butenhoff et al., 2012) are the only tumor data appropriate for dose-response modeling and were used to develop a cancer potency factor. The BMDL for 5% tumor incidence is 2.36 mg/kg/day, and the corresponding cancer potency factor is 0.021 (mg/kg/day) -1. The dose in rats corresponding to a 1 x 10-6 risk level, 4.8 x 10-5 mg/kg/day, was converted to the human equivalent dose of 4 x 10-7 mg/kg/day (0.4 ng/kg/day) using a pharmacokinetic adjustment based on the ratio of half- lives in the two species. Using default drinking water assumptions (2 L/day water consumption; 70 kg body weight), the Health -based MCL at the 1 x 10 -6 lifetime cancer ri sk level is 14 ng/L. This value is identical to the Health -based MCL based on non-cancer endpoints developed above. Potential for additive toxicity with other PFCs The Health Effects Subcommittee note s that available information indicates that the targe t organs and modes of action are generally similar for PFOA and some other PFCs, such as PFNA. Therefore, the toxicity of PFOA and other PFCs may be additive. Although PFOA and other PFCs, including PFNA, are known to co-occur in some NJ public water suppl ies, the potential for additive toxicity of PFOA and other PFCs was not considered in development of the Health- based MCL. T he recommended Health -based MCL is 14 ng/L (0.014 \u00b5g/L). 18 INTRODUCTION Development of Health -based MCLs by New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute The New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute (DWQI) was established by the 1984 amendments to the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) at N.J.S.A. 58:12A- 20. It is charged with developing standards (Maximum Contaminant Levels; MCLs) for hazardous contaminants in drinking water and for recommending those standards to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). The Health Effects Subcommittee (formerly \"Lists and Levels Subcommittee\") of the DWQI is respo nsible for developing health -based drinking water levels (Health -based MCLs) as part of the development of MCLs are based on the goals specified in the 1984 Amendments to the NJ SDWA. For carcinogens, it is generally assumed that any level of exposure results in some level of cancer risk, and a one in one million (10-6) risk level from lifetime exposure is specified in the statute. Health -based MCLs for carcinogens are thus set at levels that are not expected to result in cancer in more than one in one million persons ingesting the contaminant for a lifetime. For non-carcinogenic effects, it is generally assumed that exposure below a threshold level will not result in adverse effects. As specified in the statue, Health -based MCLs are set at levels which are not expected to result in \"any adverse physiological effects from ingestion\" for a lifetime. The risk assessment approach used to develop Health- based MCLs is generally consiste nt with USE PA risk assessment guidance. O ther factors such as analytical quantitation limits and availability of treatment removal technology are also considered in the final MCL recommendation. For carcinogens, the 1984 Amendments to the NJ SDWA require that MCLs are set as close to the one in one million lifetime risk goal as possible \"within the limits of medical, scientific and technological feasibility.\" For non- carcinogens, MCLs are set as close to the goal of no adverse effects as possible \"within t he limits of practicability and feasibility.\" T o support the development of an MCL recommendation by the DWQI, the Health Effects Subcommittee has developed a draft Health-based Maximum Contaminant Level for PFO A. As specified in the 1984 Amendments to the NJ SDWA, this Health -based MCL is intended to be protective for chronic (lifetime) drinking water exposure. Timeline of Health Effects Subcommittee's evaluation of PFOA On January 27, 2009, the DWQI voted unanimously to add PFOA to its work plan for development of an MCL recommendation (DWQI, 2009b). On September 10, 2010, the Health Effects Subcommittee reported to the DWQI Testing and Treatment Subcommittees that it had made progress in its evaluation PFOA. Although no decision on a Health- based MCL recommendation had been made, the Subcommittee provided a memo stating that it was 19 considering potential values for a PFOA Health -based MCLs within the range of 10 ng/L to 40 ng/L , or as low as reasonably achievable ( DWQI, 2010). I n 2012, s everal cu rrent and former members of the Health Effects Subcommittee published a comprehensive review of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant in a peer -reviewed journal (Post et al., 2012). This publication was based in part on the literature review and evaluation conducted by the Health Effects Subcommittee in 2009-2010. O n March 21, 2014, New Jersey DEP Commissioner Bob Martin requested that the DWQI recommend MCLs for three perfluorinated sulfonic acid The Health Effects Subcommittee commenced its evaluation of PFOA after completing its work on PFNA, for which t he DWQI recommended an MCL on July 1, 2015 (DWQI, 2015a). Document development process The Subcommittee began its current evaluation of PFOA by formulating an approach for the review of relevant information and document development. Because the scientific database related to health effects of PFOA is very large, the Subcommittee chose to focus on specific endpoints from human and animal studies for hazard identification and/or dose-response . Criteria for sel ection of the human and animal endpoints that were reviewed in depth are discussed in the Epidemiology and Toxicology sections. T he Health Effects Subcommittee conducted a literature search of the PubMed database through April 2015 using relevant search terms which are provided in Appendix 1. The U.S. National Library of Medicine's Toxline database was searched using similar keywords as the PubMed search strings. The Toxline search yielded a significant number of non- peer reviewed documents including articles, policy papers, and grant proposals, and ultimately Toxline did not identify additional peer -reviewed literature for inclusion in the Subcommittee's review. Studies evaluated by the Subcommittee also included relevant citations from the earlier Subcommittee evaluations of PFOA mentioned above, as well as backward searching. PubMed is searched on a monthly basis by the NJDEP Environmental Research Library, and an ongoing title review of these searches was conducted to identify any additional studies for inclusion. T he original PubMed search identified 2,016 references . All of these references were screened by title, abstract, and/or full text. Title and abstract review was used to sort studies into inclusion categories for consideration for detailed evaluation related to hazard identification and/or dose- response evaluation using EndNote (Appendix 1). Studies were excluded if they were \"Unrelated \" (did not assess PFOA , proposals, or reviews ), or \"Non-h ealth\"' (studies of a analytical methods, environmental occurrence, sources of human or wildlife exposure, and other topics not directly related to health effects ). Some s tudies categorized as \"Non -health\" are cited 20 in relevant sections of the document, whe n appropriate. Remaining s tudies were identified as either \"in v itro\", \"Experimental A nimal\", or \"Hu man\". F urther categorization of included studies is described in more detail in the Epidemiology and Toxicology sections. The numbe r of records retrieved and number of studies sorted into inclus ion/exclusion categories ar e also provided in Appendix 1. F ollowing identification of studies to be reviewed in depth, data were extracted from included studies into individual study ta bles and/or summary tables , as des cribed in the Epidemiology and Toxicology sections . Individual study ta bles f or the Epidemiology section are provided in Appendix 4 and for the Toxicology section in Appendix 5. Some sections of the document that provide background information but do not di rectly i mpact development of t he Health-based MCL (e.g. Environmental Sources, Fate, and Occurrence) are based on updates of the Subcommittee's previous evaluations of PFOA. In 2014, the DWQI posted a request for public input regarding data or technical information about the toxicology , epidemiology, toxicokinetics, or other health effects topics related to PFOA that should be considered in developing an MCL. The DWQI received one submission on PFOA, and relevant comments from this submission were considered by the Health Effects Subc ommittee. A draf t of the Health- based MCL Support Document was completed on June 27, 2016. Public comments on the draft document were accepted from September 22 to November 21, 2016. Minor r evisions were made to the draft document based on consideration of the comments , to add relevant recent information, and to update a few citations. The conclusions presented herein in the final document do not differ from those presented in the draft document. BACKGROUND INFORMATION PFOA is a member of a class of anthropogenic chemicals called perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with structures consisting of a totally fluorinated carbon chain of varying length and a charged functional group, such as carboxylate or sulfonate (Lindstrom et al., 2011a) . PFCs are members of a larger class of compounds, poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which also includes fluorinated compounds with structures that differ from PFCs (Buck et al., 2011). The eight- carbon PFCs, PFOA and PFOS, were the most intensively investigated compounds in earlier studies, while current research focuses on a wider range of PFAS. 21 Physical and Chemical Properties ( PubChem, g/cm3 at 20 oC Water Solubility g/L at 25 oC Log octanol/water partition coefficient: Not applicable (see below). Taste Threshold (water): No data Odor Threshold (water): No data Odor Threshold (air): No data PFOA is a fully fluorinated carboxylic acid. Because carbon -fluorine bonds are among the strongest found in organic chemistry due to fluorine's electronegativity, PFOA and other PFCs are extremely stable and resistant to chemical reactions. PFOA is resistant to biodegr adation, direct photolysis, atmospheric photooxidation, and hydrolysis, and is not known to degrade in the environment (Vaalgamaa et al., 2011). PFOA contains a long perfluorocarbon tail that is both hydrophobic and oleophobic (repels both water and oil ) and a charged end (the carboxylate group) that is hydrophilic. Because it forms a separate layer when mixed with hydrocarbons and water, measurement of the octanol:water partition coefficient is not practical (Prevedouros et al., 2006). PFOA has been manufactured as salts such as ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) or sodium perfluorooctanoate (NaPFOA) which dissociate in water. The PK a of PFOA is 2.8. At the pH range found in drinking water (6.5- 8.5) and within the body, PFOA is present almost totally in the non-volatile anionic form, the perfluoro octanoate anion (Goss, 2008; Rayne and Forest, 2010). 22 Production and Use PFOA and other PFCs have been produced for use in commercial products and in industrial processes for over 60 years. Because of their unique surfactant properties and their resistance to chemical and thermal degradation, they have been used in many applications including water-, soil-, and stain-resistant coating for fabrics used in clothing, upholstery, and carpets, oil- resistant coatings for food contact paper, aviation hydraulic fluids, fire-fighting foams, paints, adhesives, waxes, and polishes, and other products. They are used industrially as surfactants, emulsifiers, wetting agents, additives, and coatings. PFOA is used as a processing aid (emulsifier) in the production of fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluoroelastomers used as non- stick coatings on cookware, membranes for waterproof/breathable clothing, electrical wire casing, fire and chemical resistant tubing, and plumbing thread seal tape (Lau et al., 2007; Buck et al., 2011; Lindstrom et al., 2011a; Post et al., 2012). P FOA has been produced by two different manufacturing methods, electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. The ECF process was primarily used from 1947 to 2002. In this process, 1-heptanecarbonyl fluoride is dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and an electrical current is passed through the solution causing all hydrogen atoms on the carbon backbone to be replaced with fluorine atoms. This process produces a mixture of isomeric forms including branched, linear, and cyclic isomers of various chain lengths (Prevedouros et al., 2006; Buck et al, 2011; Lindstrom et al., 2011a). T he second process, telomerization, has been primarily used since 2002. This process involves reacting pentafluoroiodoethane with tetrafluoroethane in the molar rat io that gives the desired chain length. The product of this reaction is then oxidized to form the carboxylic acid. This process produces straight chain (linear) PFOA (Prevedouros et al., 2006; Buck et 2011a). PF OA and PFOS were the two PFCs produced in the greatest amounts. PFOS was principally manufactured by the 3M Company, which completed its phase-out of production of this chemical in 2002. In 2006, the eight major U.S. producers of PFOA voluntarily agreed to reduce emissio ns and product content of PFOA and related substances, including precursors of PFOA, on a global basis by 95% by 2010 and to work towards elimination of these substances by 2015 (USEPA, 2016b). According to USEPA, reports submitted by the participating co mpanies in 2013 and 2014 indicated that they were on track to achieve the goal of phasing out these chemicals by the end of 2015. However, other manufacturers and users of PFOA that are not participants in the voluntary agreem ent with USEPA continue to emit large amounts of PFOA to the environment, particularly in nations overseas including China, India, Russia, and Poland (USEPA, 2009; Lindstrom et al., 2011; OECD, 2015). 23 In 2009, the USEPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (O PPT) developed action plans for several groups of chemicals of concern including PFCs (USEPA, 2009a ). According to the USEPA Action Plan, concerns about PFOA and other PFCs include their worldwide presence in the environment, wildlife, and humans; their persistence in the environment and bioaccumulative potential in humans and wildlife; and the significant adverse effects observed in wildlife and laboratory animals. USEPA stated that \"given the long half -life of these chemicals in humans (years), it can reasonably be anticipated that continued exposure could increase body burdens to levels that would result in adverse outcomes.\" U SEPA (2009a ) stated that PFOA and other long- chain PFCs are of concern for children's health, based on studies in laboratory animals that have demonstrated developmental toxicity, including neonatal mortality. They stated that: \"Children's exposures are greater than adults due to increased intakes of food, water, and air per pound of body weight, as well as child- specific exposure pathways such as breast milk consumption, mouthing and ingestion of non-food items, and increased contact with the floor. Biomonitoring studies have found PFCs in cord blood and breast milk, and have reported that children have higher levels of some PFCs compared to adults. Thus, given the pervasive exposure to PFCs, the persistence of PFCs in the environment, and studies finding deleterious health effects, USEPA will examine the potential risks to fetuses and children.\" U SEPA (2009a ) stated that it intend ed to propose actions to address the potential risks from long-chain PFCs in 2012 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). USEPA stated that potential actions could include banning or restricting their manufacture (including import), processing, and use, depending on the findings of more detailed analysis of information on these compounds. I n 2013, the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) Member State Committee unanimously agreed that PFOA should be classified as a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) because it has potential to cause reproductive toxicity and is persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (ECHA, 2013. ECHA (2015) is currently considering restrictions on the manufacture, marketing and use of PFOA, its salts and PFOA- related substances, as well as of articles and mixtures containing these substances . GUIDANCE AND STANDARDS DEVELOPED BY NEW JERSEY, OTHER STATES, AND USEPA New Jersey Health -based Drinking Water Guidance New Jersey DEP developed chronic (lifetime) drinking water guidance for PFOA in drinking water of 40 ng/L in 2007 (NJDEP, 2007). The basis for the NJDEP guidance was subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal (Post et al., 2009a). 24 The New Jersey guidance is based on the NOAELs (No Observed Adverse Eff ects Levels) and LOAELs from toxicology studies identified in the draft USEPA (2005a) PFOA risk assessment and considered the conclusions of the USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006) review of this draft risk assessment. The draft USEPA (2005a) risk assessme nt compared PFOA exposures prevalent within the U.S. general population with NOAELs and LOAELs for various life stages identified in toxicology studies. As such, the USEPA (2005a) draft risk assessment did not develop a Reference Dose or a cancer slope factor for PFOA, and it did not address the relationship between drinking water concentration and human body burden, as measured by serum level. Because the half -life of PFOA is much longer in humans (several years) than in the animal species used in the toxicological studies (several hours to 30 days), a given external dose (mg/kg/day) results in a much greater internal dose (as indicated by serum level) in humans than in animals. Therefore, comparisons between effect levels in animal studies and human exposures were made on the basis of serum levels rather than external dose. This approach was recommended by USEPA (2005a) and the USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006). Target Human Serum Levels (analogous to RfDs, but on a serum level basis) were derived by applying UFs to the measured or modeled serum levels at the NOAELs or LOAELs identified by USEPA (2005a). The default RSC of 20% was applied to the Target Human Serum Levels to account for contributions to serum PFOA from non- drinking water exposures. The default RSC value is used when the relative contributions of drinking water versus non- drinking water sources are not fully characterized, as is the case for PFOA. USEPA (2005a) classified PFOA as having \"suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential\", whereas the USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006) disagreed and recommended a classification of \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\". For th e cancer end point, the serum level resulting in a one in one million (10-6) risk level was estimated by linear extrapolation from the modeled serum level in animals at a dose resulting in an approximate 10% tumor incidence. The mean ratio of approximat ely 100:1 between serum PFOA levels and drinking PFOA water concentrations in exposed communities was used to determine the drinking water concentrations that are expected to result in a given increase in serum PFOA level (Post et al., 2009a). Data suppor ting a ratio of 100:1 or greater is discussed in the Toxicokinetics section below. Because this approach is based on the observed relationship between serum and drinking water concentrations, assumptions for body weight, volume of water ingested daily, or half -life of PFOA in humans or experimental animals were not explicitly used in the calculation of the health -based drinking water concentrations. 25 The range of health -based drinking water concentrations for the seven endpoints assessed was 0.04- 0.26 g/L , and several of the concentrations fell within a similar range (0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.08 g/L). The most sensitive endpoints, resulting in a drinking water concentration of 40 ng/L, were decreased body weight and hematological effects in the adul t female rat in a chronic dietary study (Sibinski, 1987). This value was determined to be protective for carcinogenic effects, as the drinking water concentration at the 10-6 cancer risk level was estimated as 60 ng/L. It should be noted that a large body of health effects information, including toxicology studies reporting sensitive developmental effects in mice and epidemiology studies reporting associations of PFOA with numerous health effects, has become available subsequent to the USEPA (2005a) ris k assessment that served as the basis for the New Jersey guidance. These data were therefore not considered in the development of the NJDEP (2007) guidance, and they are considered in the development of the recommended Health -based MCL presented in this document. USEPA Drinking Water Health Advisory In May 2016, the USEPA Office of Water finalized a drinking water Health Advisory for PFOA of 70 ng/L (USEPA, 2016a). This Health Advisory is intended to apply to both lifetime exposure and short term exposure. It replaces the earlier the USEPA Office of Water (2009b) Provisional Health Advisory for PFOA of 400 ng/L, developed in 2009, which was stated to be intended to protect for \"short- term exposure\" (defined by the USEPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) as up to 30 days; USEPA, 2011a). USEPA (2016c) also finalized a PFOS of 70 ng/L, and USEPA (2016d) states that the total concentration of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should not exceed 70 ng/L. A detailed discussion of the basis for the USEPA (2016a) Health Advisory for PFOA and a comparison with the recommended DWQI Health-based MCL are provided in Appendix 2. In summary, the USEPA Health Advisory is based on a Reference Dose (RfD) of 20 ng/kg/day. The RfD is based on delayed ossification and accelerated puberty in male offspring in a mouse developmental toxicology study (Lau et al., 2006). The default Relative Source Contribution factor of 20% was used to account for non-drinking water exposures. The USEPA Health Advisory uses a drinking water consumption rate of 0.054 L/kg/day, based on the 90th percentile for lactating women, which is higher than the default consumption rate of based on adult exposure factors. Figure 1 shows the predicted increases in serum PFOA levels from ongoing exposure in drinking water at the USEPA Health Advisory (70 ng/L), the NJDEP (2007) guidance (40 ng/L), and the 26 Health -based MCL (14 ng/L) recommended in this document. Predictions based on both average (0.016 L/kg/day) and upper percentile (0.029 L/kg/day) drinking water ingestion rates are shown. A clearance factor developed by USEPA scientists (Lorber and Egeghy, 2011) to relate human PFOA exposures to human serum PFOA levels was used to predict the increases in serum PFOA from exposures to these level in drinking water. With average water consumption, ongoing exposure to 70 ng/L (the USEPA Health Advisory) is predicted to increase serum PFO A by 8.0 ng/ml, a 4.8-fold increase from the U.S. general population (NHANES) median of 2.1 ng/ml (CDC, 2015). With upper percentile water consumption, the increase in serum PFOA level from 70 ng/L is predicted as 14 ng/ml, a 7.7-fold increase from the general population (NHANES) median. Figure 1. Increases in serum PFOA concentrations predicted from consumption of drinking water with various concentrations of PFOA (14 ng/L - Recommended Health -based MCL ; 40 ng/L - NJDEP guidance (2007) ; 70 ng/L -USEPA Lifetime Health Advisory ). Guidance and standards of other states Several other states (e.g. Minnesota, Maine, and North Carolina) developed standards or guidance for PFOA in drinking water or groundwater prior to 2016. Because many states have stated that their earlier PFOA values will be updated or are under review in light of the finalization of the USEPA (2016a) Health Advisory, the basis for these earlier values is not presented here. New Hampshire recently adopted 70 ng/L fo r the total of PFOA and PFOS as a groundwater stan dard that is also applicable to public water systems (NH, 2017; NH DES, 2017). 27 In 2016, Vermont developed a drinking water health advisory (VT DOH, 2016) that was used for a basis for a Ground Water Enforcement Standard (VT DEC, 2016a) which is also applied as a drinking water standard (VT DEC, 2016b) for PFOA , PFOS, and the total of the two compounds of 20 ng/L. These Vermont values are based on the Reference Dose (RfD) of 2 x 10-5 mg/kg/day from the draft USEPA (201 4) PFOA Health Advisory (which is the same as the RfD in the final USEPA [2016a] PFOA Health Advisory), drinking water exposure assumptions for a child less than 1 year of age (instead of default adult exposure assumptions), and the default Relative Source Contribution (RSC) factor of 20%. ENVIRONMENTAL FATE, TRANSPORT, AND OCCURRENCE Environmental Fate and Transport Because of the extreme stability of their c arbonfluorine bonds, PFOA and other PFCs are extremely resistant to degradation in the environment and thus persist indefinitely (Buck et al., 2011; Lindstrom et al., 2011a ). As discussed above, the production and use of PFOA and its precursors has been phased out by m ajor U.S. manufacturers. However, environmen tal contam ination and resulting human exposure to PFOA are anticipated to conti nue for the foreseeable future due to its environmental persistence, formation from precursor compounds , and continued production by other manufacturers . P FOA and other PFCs are found in many environmental media (e.g. drinking water, surface water, groundwater, air, sludge, soils, sediments, outdoor and indoor dust, and ice caps) in locations around the world including remote polar regions (Lau et al., 2007). PFCs are also found in wildlife (fish, birds, mammals) including in remote polar regions. However, the bioconcentration factor for PFOA is lower than for PFOS or longer chain perfluorocarboxylates such as PFNA (Martin et al., 2003; Conder et al., 2008), and concentrations of PFOA in wildlife in remote locations are generally lower than for these other compounds (Butt et al., 2010). T wo major pathways have been proposed for long-range transport of PFOA and other PFCs to remote locations worldwide, including the Arctic ( Figure 2; Lau et al., 2007, 2013; Butt et al., 2010). The relative contributions of each of these pathways are not known. The first pathway involves the atmospheric transport of volatile precursors such as 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH ), followed by oxidation of the precursors to PFOA and other PFCs which are then deposited onto the land or the water. The second pathway involves long-range aqueous transport of emitted perfluorinated carboxylates such as PFOA in their anionic forms to remote locations by currents on the ocean's surface. 28 Figure 2. Major transport pathways of PFCs to the Arctic (and other remote locations), by Annika Jahnke (Butt et al., 2010) Fate and Transport Relevant to Drinking Wa ter Contamination PFOA and some other PFCs are distinct from other persistent and bioaccumulative organic compounds because of their importance as drinking water contaminants. PFOA exists predominantly as an anion under environmental conditions, does not bind well to soil, migrates readily from soil to groundwater, and is highly water-soluble (Davis et al., 2007). The se properties of PFOA differ from those of other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants such as polychlorinated dioxins and furans, PCBs, and pesticides like chlordane and DDT. These other compounds are generally not significant as drinking water contaminants because they have high octanol/water partition coefficients . Thus, they have a high affinity for soil and sediments but low water solubility (Post et al., 2011). P FOA that is released to the environment can contaminate surface water and groundwater used as sources of drinking water. Sources of PFOA in the environment include discharge to air and water from industrial facilities where it is made or used (Davis et al., 2007); release of aqueous firefighting foams, particularly at military sites, airports, and fire fighter training facilities (Moody et al., 2003; Backe et al., 2013); disposal in landfills (Eggen et al., 2010); discharge from wastewater treatment plants treating domestic and/or industrial waste (Sinclair and Kannan, 2006); street runoff (Mura kami et al., 2009); storm water runoff (Kim and Kannan, 2007); land application of biosolids (sludge) from wastewater treatment plants treating industrial waste (Clarke and Smith, 2011; Lindstrom et al., 2011b; Sepulvado et al., 2011); land application of wastewater from industrial sources (Konwick et al., 2008); and use of contaminated industrial waste as a soil amendment (Skutlarek et al., 2006; H\u00f6lzer et al., 2008). E nvironmental transport pathways that can result in surface water and groundwater contamination by PFOA after release from an industrial source are shown in Figure 3 (Davis et al., 2007) and were reviewed by Lau et al. (2007) and Butt et al. (2010). 29 As is the case for other groundwater contaminants, PF OA can reach drinking water wells via the well-established pathway of mi gration of a groundwater plume that has been contam inated either directly from surface spills or by contam inated surface water mixing with groundwater drawn in by pumping wells. Unlike many other environmental contaminants, PFOA can also reach groundwater from air emissions from nearby industrial facilities, followed by deposition from air onto soil, and migration through the soil to groundwater (Davis et al., 2007). I n West Virginia and Ohio, drinking water wells as far as 20 miles away were contaminated with PFOA by releases from an industrial facility where it was used as a processing aid in fluoropolym er production. Groundwater contamination occurred via soil deposition of PFOA that had been emitted into the air followed by migration to groundwater, and, to some extent, recharge of the groundwater aquifer with contaminated surface water from the Ohio River (Steenland et al., 2009a; Shin et al., 2011). PFOA was detected in public w ater supply wells in this vicinity at levels up to > 4000 ng/L (DuPont and URS Diamond Corporate Remediation Group, 2008) and in private wells at up to >13,000 ng/L (Hoffman et al., 2011). In New Jersey, PFOA was detected at up to 190 ng/L in shallow unconfined wells of a public water supply located near an industrial source (Post et al., 2009a), and at > 40 ng/L, with a maximum above 400 ng/L, in 59 of 104 private wells within a radius of slightly more than 2 miles of this facility (DuPont, 2009); contam ination of the distant wells was likely due to air deposition (Post et al., 2012). F igure 3. APFO (PFOA) transport near discharge source (Davis et al., 2007) Formation from precursor compounds An additional source of PF OA in the environment is the breakdown of precursor compounds such as the fluorotelomer alcohol, 8:2 FTOH [F3(CF 2)7CH 2 CH 2OH], used industrially and in consumer products (Butt et al., 2010; Buck et al., 2010; Butt et al., 2014). diesters (diPAPs) (e.g. diPAPs 8:2; Figure 4) are found in greaseproof food contact papers, wastewater treatment plant sludge, and paper fibers from paper mills (D'eon et al., 2009) . These larger molecules release 8:2 FTOH that can degrade to PFOA . F igure 4. Structure of diPAPs 8:2 PFOA is formed from these precursor compounds through biodegradation in soil, sludge, and wastewater (Sinclair and Kannan, 2006; Lee et al., 2010) as well as through chemical reactions in the atmosphere (Figure 2). PFOA and other PFCs have been found at higher concentrations in effluent than influent at wast ewater treatment plants. This increase is believed to result from the biodegradation of telomer alcohols and other precursors from domestic and industrial sources within the wastewater treatment plant (Sinclair and Kannan, 2006; Lee and Mabury, 2011). Fluoroacrylate polymers, used in commercial products, may also degrade in soil to release FTOH which can degrade to PFCs such as PFOA (Russell et al., 2008; Washington et al., 2009). Since PFOA, once formed, does not degrade appreciably, environmental PFOA l evels are increased by conversion of even a small fraction of the precursors to the terminal breakdown product, PFOA. Occurrence in drinking water PFOA and other PFCs occur in raw and finished drinking water from both groundwater and surface water sources in New Jersey, other parts of the United States, and nations around the world (reviewed by Mak et al., 2009; Post et al., 2012; Post et al., 2013). PFOA and other PFCs are found in drinking water impacted by discharges from industrial facilities, release of aqueous firefighting foam, and other known sources of contamination, as well as where the source is unknown (Post et al., 2012). PFOA has been detected at high frequency in some river basins that are important sources of drinking water. For example, it was detected (>1 ng/L) in 82.3% of samples from 80 locations throughout the Cape Fear River (North Carolina) drainage basin, population 1.7 million, at a median of 12.6 ng/L and a maximum of 287 ng/L (Nakayama et al., 2007). In the Upper Mississippi River drainage basin in the Midwestern U.S., population 30 million, it was detected (>1 ng/L) in 73% of 88 locations with a median of 2.07 ng/L and a maximum of 125 ng/L. Elevated levels at certain sites were attributed to point sources in this study (Nakayama et al., 2010). In the Tennessee River in Alabama, PFOA levels were 395+128 ng/L in samples from the 35 river miles downstream of the site of di scharge from a fluorochemical manufacturing 31 facility, with the highest levels (521 -598 ng/L) in the 6 river miles furthest downstream (Hansen et al., 2002). In Germany, PFOA and other PFCs in organic material applied to agricultural land contaminated the M oehne and Ruhr Rivers, important sources of drinking water. PFOA was detected at up to 33,900 ng/L in a creek near the site of contamination upstream of these rivers, and at up to 519 ng/L in drinking water from the Moehne River (Skutlarek et al., 2006). PFOA and other PFCs are not effectively removed from drinking water by standard treatment processes such as coagulation/flocculation, sand filtration, sedimentation, medium -pressure ozonation, chloramination, and chlorination. However, PFOA can be removed from drinking water by granular activated carbon (GAC) or reverse osmosis (Rumsby et al., 2009, Bartell et al., 2010a, Tagaki et al., 2011; Eschauzier 2012; Apple man et al., 2014; DWQI, 2015b). Therefore, unless specific treatment for removal of PFCs is in place, concentrations of PFOA and other PFCs detected in raw drinking water can be considered to be representative of concentrations in finished drinking water (Post et al., 2013). Occurrence in New Jersey drinking water Considerable information is available on the occurrence of PFOA and other PFCs in New Jersey public water systems (PWS). This includes data from 53 PWS from two NJDEP occurrence studies of PFCs, substantial additional data submitted to NJDEP by PWS and other parties, a nd data from the nationwide USEPA Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 3 (UCMR3) survey. For the two NJDEP occurrence studies and most of the additional data submitted to NJDEP, analysis of samples was performed by certified laboratories with Reporting Levels (RLs) that were generally 4 -5 ng/L or lower . To the knowledge of the Health Effects Subcommittee, statewide drinking water studies of PFOA with sensitive RLs such as these have not been conducted in states other than New Jersey. In contrast, the RL for PFOA in USEPA UCMR3 is much higher (20 ng/L ) than the RLs in the other NJ PWS monitoring data. NJDEP studies of occurrence in New Jersey public water systems Following detection of PFOA in a New Jersey PWS at up to 190 ng/L in a groundwater source and up to 64 ng/L in tap water, two statewide studies of the occurrence of PFOA and other PFCs in drinking water were conducted by NJDEP. The 2006 study tested 23 PWS for PFOA and PFOS, and the 2009- 10 study tested 33 additional PWS eight 2014; Post et al., 2009a ; Post et al., 2013). The 2006 NJDEP study included 29 samples of raw and/or finished water from 23 NJ PWS including 14 with groundwater sources, 8 with surface water sources, and one using both groundwater and surface water. In the 4 PWS where both raw and finished water were analyzed, PFOA concentrations were similar in both samples. Of the PWS in this study, PFOA was detected in 15 of 23 systems (65%) at or above the RL (4 ng/L), and in 3 of 23 systems below the RL. PFOA was detected above the RL (9 of 13 ) at up to 33 ng/L, or below the RL (1 of 13), in 32 10 of 13 groundwater samples (77%) from unconfined or semiconfined aquifers, but was not detected in the two groundwater samples fro m confined aquifers. Additionally, PFOA was detected above the RL (7 of 9 ; 78%) at up to 39 ng/L, or below the RL (2 of 9; 22%), in samples from all 9 PWS using surface water sources. In this study, PFOS was detected (>4 ng/L) in 30% 2009a ). T he 2009-2010 NJDEP study tested raw water from 30 PWS for PFOA, PFOS, and 8 other PFCs. The sites for this study were chosen for geographic diversity, representing 19 of NJ's 21 counties. The study included 18 PWS with groundwater sources (17 unconfined, one confined) and 12 PWS with surface water sources. One or more PFC was detected (>5 ng/L) at 21 sites (70%), with the number of individual compounds detected varying from one (in 8 samples) to a maximum of 8 in one sample. PFOA was the most commonly detected PFC (17 of 30 samples; 57%), including 6 of 18 of groundwater samples (33%) and 11 of 12 of surface water samples (92%). When PFOA was detected, other PFCs were often but not always found in the same sample . PFOA was found at the highest maximum concentration of any of the PFCs analyzed in the study, 100 ng/L. This highest detection was in a PWS intake from a river, and the likely source was subsequently identified as discharge from an upstre am facility that ma de and used products containing PFOA and other PFCs (Post et al., 2013; NJDEP, 2014). NJDEP database of PFCs in New Jersey Public Water Systems The NJDEP Division of Science, Research, and Environmental Health maintains a n internal database of PFC results from NJ PWS including the two NJDEP occurrence studies, additional raw and finished water data submitted to NJDEP by PWS and other parties , and detections from UCMR3 data. As of January 2016, the database included 1035 samples (423 raw water, 549 finished water, and 63 distribution system) from 282 sampling locations in 80 PWS (including 72 PWS with data from NJDEP studies and/or submitted to NJDEP, and 8 additional PWS with PFC detections in UCMR3) . Of th ese samples, 374 were analyzed for only PFOA and PFOS, and 661 were analyzed for a broader suite of PFCs. P FOA was the most frequently detected PFC in NJ PWS. It was detected at some level in 65% of 72 PWS included in the NJDEP database (excluding UCMR3 data; Table 1 ). The highest detection in finished water was 100 ng/L, and concentrations exceeding 40 ng/L were reported in at least one finished water sample from 12 of 72 PWS (17%). It was also detected at >20 ng/L in UCMR3 monitoring in finished wate r from six additional PWS that are not otherwise included in the database, including two PWS that had levels above 40 ng/L. 33 Table 1. PFOA concentrations in raw or finished water from PWS included in NJDEP database * PFOA Concentration 10 14% >40 12 17% *Data shown are highest concentration found in raw or finished water from the PWS. Levels in finished water from some water supplies included may be lower because several raw water sources are blended in the treatment plant. **Reporting levels (RLs) vary among samples and range from 2.5 - 20 ng/L. Therefore, the percentage of PWS with RL -<10, and 10 - <20, may actually be higher than shown. Comparison of NJ occurrence to nationwide UCMR3 data and studies from other nations Data on PFOA in PWS in New Jersey and nationwide is available through the USEPA UCMR3. Under UCMR3, nationwide monitoring of finished water for 30 unregulated contaminants, including PFOA and 5 other PFCs, was conducted in 20132015 by all U.S. large PWS (serving more than 10,000 people) and 800 representative smaller PWS (serving less than 10,000 people) (USEPA, 2012b). UCMR3 data therefore provide useful information on occurrence of PFCs in NJ in comparison to the rest of the United States. However, comparison of the UCMR3 PFC data with other New Jersey PFC occurrence data is complicated by the fact that the UCMR3 RL s for PFOA (20 ng/L) and other PFCs are much higher than the RLs for other PFC data in the NJDEP database (generally < 5 ng/L). UCMR3 monitoring in New Jersey includes all 165 large community PWS, 13 of about 435 small community PWS, and 8 of about 700 non transient non community water systems. A comparison of national versus New Jersey PFC data from UCMR3 reported through January 2016 is shown in Table 2 (data obtained from USEPA, 2016f ). PFOA was detected ( > 20 ng/L) in PWS at locations throughout the state, and was detected more than five times more frequently in New Jersey PWS (10.53%) than nationally (1.93%). PFNA was also detected much more frequently in NJ (2.34%) than nationally (0.22%). However, PFNA was detected only in the vicinity of a likely industrial source located in Gloucester County (DWQI, 2015c) but not in other parts of New Jersey. The occurrence of the other PFCs included in UCMR3 (PFHpA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFBS) was similar or slightly higher in New Jersey compared to nationally. 34 Table 2.

(2013). PFOA was detected more frequently and at a higher maximum concentration in the 2009- 10 New Jersey PWS study than in comparable drinking water studies in France, Spain, and Chi na which had RLs similar to the RL in the NJ study. Occurrence in NJ private wells A statewide study of PFOA or other PFCs in New Jersey private wells has not been conducted. PFOA was detected at >40 ng/L, with a maximum above 400 ng/L, in 59 of 104 private wells within a radius of slightly more than 2 miles of a New Jersey industrial source (DuPont, 2009); contamination of the distant wells was likely due to air deposition. M ore recently, PFOA has been detected in private wells near another facility which used and discharged a mixture of PFCs that consisted primarily of PFNA and also DWQI, that expos ure to PFOA and/or its precursors is ubiquitous in the U.S. and throughout the world. PFOA has a human half -life of several years and remains in the body for a long period of time after exposure occurs. Data on blood serum concentrations from the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers with occupational exposure are summarized below. Consumption of contaminated drinking water results in increased blood serum concentrations , while the highest blood serum concentrations have been found in occupationally exposed workers. PFOA is detected in human breast milk, amniotic fluid , and umbilical cord blood, demonstrating that exposure occurs during prenatal and postnatal development , and i t has also been detected in human seminal fluid. 35 Blood Serum General population PFOA and other PFCs are present in the serum of the general population in the United States and in countries worldwide. This topic was recently comprehensively reviewed by Kato et al. (2015). D ata from archived serum samples from the Un ited States and Norway indicate that human exposure to PFOA has been ongoing for decades, and that exposure increased greatly in the 1980s in these two locations. Analysis of serum samples collected up to 56 years ago found that the median level in serum from pregnant California women sampled in 1960-63 (n=40) was 0.27 ng/ml, approximately 10-fold lower than the median in serum from California women sampled in 1981-86 (n=30) and 2009 (n=35), which were 2.71 and 2.08 ng/ml, respectively (Wang et al., 2011a). In pooled serum samples from Norwegian men (age 40-50) collected over a 29 year period (1977-2006), PFOA levels gradually increased from 0.58 ng/ml in 1976 to 4.9 ng/ml in 2001, an 8-fold increase, followed by a yearly decline to 2.7 ng/ml in 2006. A similar temporal pattern was seen in serum samples collected from Norwegian children and male and female adults of other age groups between 1976 and 2007 (Haug et al., 2009). The largest stud ies of the U.S. general population are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Kato et al., 2011; CDC, 2015) and American Red Cross blood donors (Olsen et al., 2012). PFOA is one of four PFCs (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and perfluorohexane sulfonate [PFHxS ]) that been detected in the serum of greater than 99% of a representative sample of the U.S. population, age 12 or older, in NHANES (Kato et al., 2011). PFOA a nd these other PFCs are biologically persistent, with human half -lives of several years, as discussed in the Toxicokinetics section below. Data from six cycles of NHANES monitoring between 1999-2000 and 2011-12 show that serum PFOA levels have decreased in the U.S. general population during this time period (Table 3). In the first NHANES (1999 -2000), the geometric mean serum concentration was 5.21 ng/ml and the 95 th percentile was 11.9 ng/ml, while the most recent NHANES (2011- 12) found a geometric mean and 95th percentile of 2.08 and 5.68 ng/ml, respectively. In the NHANES surveys, PFOA concentrations were lower in those 12-19 years of age than in older individuals, and were somewhat higher in males than females. In data from the three ethnic groups that were analyzed over time, levels were consistently lowest in Mexican American s, intermediate in non -Hispanic blacks, and highest in non- Hispanic whites (CDC, 2015). 36 Table 3. Serum PFOA concentration from NHANES (ng/ml) Year Geometric Mean Percentile 2011 -12 2.08 2.08 3.03 4.35 5.68 1904 7.50 2233 2007 -08 4.12 4.30 2120 1999 -2000 5.21 5.20 6.90 9.40 11.9 1562 CDC, 2015 A similar pattern of decreasing serum PFOA concentrations over time was seen in three studies of American Red Cross blood donors in 2000- 2001, 2006, and 2010 (Olsen et al., 2012). Each study included samples from 600- 645 subjects from six locations throughout the U.S., with an approximately equal number in each of five 10 -year age categories (20 -29 through 60 -69 years of age ) from each location. Geometric means and 95 th percentile concentrations, respectively, were 4.7 and 12.0 ng/ml in 200- 01, 3.44 and 7.9 ng/ml in 2006, and 2.44 and 6.6 ng/ml in 2010. As in the NHANES studies, serum concentrations were generally higher in males than females. Serum PFOA levels are generally comparable to those found in the U.S in developed countries throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, and Australia (Post et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2015). In contrast to industrialized nations where serum PFOA is almost universally detected, PFOA was detected at > 0.5 ng/ml in only 12 of 55 serum samples from Afghan children and adults , with a maximum of 1.5 ng/ml; relatively low serum levels have also been reported in other developing countries where exposure to PFOA and other PFCs may be lower than in industrialized nations (Hemat et al., 2010). PFOA concentrations in pooled serum samples from children (age 3- 11) in 2001- 2002 NHANES ranged from about 6- 8 ng/ml, significantly higher than in pooled serum samples from adults in this study (Kato et al., 2009). Median and maximu m serum PFOA levels in 300 Texas children, age <1 to 12 years, were 2.85 ng/ml and 13.50 ng/ml; adults were not included in this study. In the Texas study, t he median level did not differ between genders, and was lower in those less than 3 years of age than in the older age groups (Schecter et al., 2011). Exposures to infants and young children are discussed in detail in the section on developmental exposures below. Communities with drinking water exposures Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water concentrations results in substantial increase s in serum levels. The quantitative relationship between drinking water exposure and human serum PFOA levels is discussed below. 37 A recent study (Hurley et al., 2016) found substantially increased serum PFOA levels in individuals served by PWSs reporting detection of PFOA in UCMR3 monitoring. PFOA detections were relatively low, ranging from 20 ng/L (the UCMR3 RL) to 53 ng/L, with a mean of 28 ng/L. The s tudy group consisted of middle aged and older California women (n=1,333; 70% between 60 and 79 years of age). Of this group, 4.5% resided in a zipcode where a PWS reporting detection of PFOA in UCMR3 monitoring is located. The distribution of serum concentrations differed significantly (p<0.0001) in those served by a PWS where PFOA was detected (\"exposed\") as compared to those served by a PWS without a detection (\"unexposed\"). The m edian serum PFOA in the \"exposed\" was ng/ml) than in the \"unexposed\" group (2.51 ng/ml). The authors note that the contribution of drinking water to serum PFOA is likely actually greater than observed in the study since some of those classified as \"exposed\" may have received their drinking water from another point of entry (e.g. treatment plant) within the PWS that detect PFOA . Additionally, the serum PFOA levels of some participants classified as \"not exposed\" may have been increased by PFOA in drinking water at concentrations below the UCMR3 RL of 20 ng/L. P ublic water supply wells and private wells in several Ohio and West Virginia communities were contaminated by PFOA emissions from an industrial facility. In Little Hocking, Ohio, the concentration in drinking water was 3550 ng/L in 2002-2005, and the median serum PFOA concentration in 282 individuals tested in 2004-2006, with occupationally exposed individuals excluded, was 371 g/L (Emmett et al., 2006a ). The C8 Health Study (described in more detail below) is a much larg er study of Little Hocking and several other communities in this vicinity with drinking water PFOA concentrations ranging from >50 ng/L to over 3000 ng/L (Post et al., 2009a). In approximately 69,000 C8 Health Study participants, including some with occupa tional exposures, the median serum PFOA concentration in 2005-2006 was 28.2 ng/ml, as compared to the median of 4 ng/ml in the 2003-2004 NHANES study (Steenland et al., 2009a). The upper 25% of C8 Health Study participants had serum PFOA levels greater than 71 ng/ml, only slightly below the highest concentration found in 2003-2004 NHANES, 77.1 ng/ml. As in the NHANES and Red Cross blood donor studies of the general population discussed above, the median serum concentrations in males (33.7 ng/ml) were higher than females (23.7 ng/ml) in this large study of an exposed population. E mmett et al. (2006 a) observed higher serum levels in children ages 2-5 than in older children and adults in the ir study of Little Hocking, Ohio residents with exposure to PFOA in drinking water . Adults over 60 years of age also had higher levels than other age groups. In the larger C8 Health Study population, serum concentrations were also higher in children and older adults, with the lowest levels in those age 20-29 (Steenland et al., 2009a ). More recently, Shin et al. (2011) estimated a median one- year old child :maternal serum ratio of 1.27:1 from data on 40 child -mother pairs in the C8 Health Study. In a much larger study of almost 5000 mother-child 38 pairs from the C8 Health Study, serum levels in children up to age 12 were higher than in their mothers in this population; in th e youngest age category ( < 5 years) , mean levels were 44% higher than maternal levels (Mondal et al., 2012). S erum PFOA levels were also higher than in the general population in several other communities with exposure from drinking water. These include communities in Germany whose surface water source of drinking water was contaminated by runoff from industrial waste used as a soil amendment (H\u00f6lzer et al., 2008); in Alabama where a river used as a public water supply source was contaminated by industrial discharge , and PFOA from contaminated biosolids applied to agricultural land reached drinking water wells (ATSDR, 2013); in Minnesota communities where private wells and public water supply wells were contaminated by disposal of industrial waste (Landsteiner et al., 2014); in Pease, NH where public water supply wells were contaminated by military use of aqueous firefighting foam (NHDH HS, 2015); and in Hoosick Falls, NY, where drinking water was contaminated by releases from an industrial facility (NYS DOH, 2016) Occupationally exposed workers Serum PFOA levels in workers at facilities where PFOA is made or used in fluoropolymer production are much higher than in the general population. Biomonitoring data from workers at such facilities w ere reviewed by Olsen (2015). Mean or median serum concentrations of several 1000 ng/ml (several ppm) were reported for some job categories at some f acilities, with maximum serum concentrations of over 100,000 ng/ml (100 ppm), although levels in most workers were lower. In the C8 Health Study participants, the median serum level among those currently working at the Washington Works plant where PFOA was used in fluoropolymer production (n=1,171) was 148 ng/ml, as compared to 24 ng/ml in those who did not work there at or prior to the time of sampling (Steenland et al., 2009a ). S erum concentrations of PFOA and other PFCs are also elevated in professiona l ski waxing technicians due to exposures to fluorinated ski waxes that contain both the compounds themselves and their precursors (reviewed by Olsen, 2015). Other human biological matrices Seminal plasma PFOA and other PFCs were found in human seminal plasma in a study of Sri Lankans. The mean and median concentrations were 6.38 and 4.02 ng/ml, respectively , and PFOA correlated concentrations (Guruge et al., 2005). Amniotic fluid PFOA was detected in amniotic fluid in a study in the United States (Stein et al., 2012). The median blood serum:amniotic fluid concentration ratio was about 13:1. 39 Umbilical cord blood serum PFOA and other PFCs were detected in numerous studies of umbilical cord blood from the general population worldwide in studies reviewed by Post et al. (2012). Locations of these studies included Baltimore, Maryland (Abelberg et al, 2007), Ontario, Canada (Monroy et al, 2008), Denmark (Fei et al., 2007), Germany (Midasch et al., 2007), Norway (G\u00fctzkow et al., 2011), the Faroe Islands (Needham et al., 2011), Australia (Toms et al., 2009), South Africa (Hannsen et al., 2010), Korea (Kim et al., 2011), and Taiwan (Lien et al., 2011). Mean serum (or plasma) levels in these studies ranged from 1.1 ng/ml in Korea (Kim et al., 2011) to 4.4 ng/ml in Taiwan (Lien et al., 2011). No geographic pattern was apparent from this dataset, as the levels reported from Africa, Australia, Europe, and North America fell in between the levels in the two Asian studies. M ore recent additional data are reviewed by Kato et al. (2015). Breast milk PFOA was detected in human breast milk in studies from locations worldwide (reviewed by Liu et al., 2010; White et al., 2011a ; Post et al., 2012) including Massachusetts (Tao et al, 2008a), Japan (Tao et al., 2008b), China (So et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2010), Korea (Kim et al., 2011), Belgium (Roosens et al., 2010), Spain (Llorca et al., 2010), Norway (Haug et al., 2011; Thomsen et al., 2010), and Sweden (Sunstrom et al., 2011). Concentrations in breast milk wer e generally similar in studies from different parts of the world. In studies using sensitive analytical methods enabling detection of lower concentrations, median PFOA levels were 36 ng/L (Massachusetts; Tao et al., 2008a), 67 ng/ml (Japan; Tao et al., 2008b), and 46 ng/L (China; Liu et al., 2010), while PFOA was not detected or was infrequently found in breast milk in some other studies with higher detection limits (Fromme et al., 2010; von Ehrenstein et al., 2009). In the studies cited above, PFOA was frequently found in breast milk at concentrations higher than 40 ng/L, with some detections exceeding 1 00 ng/ L (for example, in Belgium; Roosens et al., 2010). N otably, breast milk concentrations were much higher in both rural and urban s amples from Shanghai province (urban mean, 616 ng/L; rural mean, 814 ng/L) than in 12 other Chinese provinces (mean, 46 ng/L ). Maternal exposures we re likely higher in Shanghai than in the other areas sampled because PFOA levels are higher in Shanghai drinking water and surface water, likely because many fluorochemical manufacturing plants are located there (Liu et al., 2010). SOURCES OF HUMAN EXPOSURE The human body burden of PFOA results from exposure to both PFOA itself and to precursor compounds that can be metablized to PFOA, such as FTOH and diPAPs (D'eon and Mabury, 2011a; Lee and Mabury, 2011). Sources of exposure to PFOA and/or its precursors include drinking water, food, migration from food packaging into food, treated fabrics (carpets, upholstery, and clothing), protective sprays, ski waxes, cosmetics and personal care products, house dust, and inhalation of indoor and outdoor air (Trudel et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2009; 40 Gewurtz et al., 2009; Freberg et al, et al., 2010; al., 2012; Knobel och et al., 2012; Fujii et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013; Kotthoff et al., 2015). Migration into food from non-stick (PTFE -coated) cookware is not considered to be a significant exposure source (Trudel et al., 2008). The relative contributions from direct exposure to PFOA and exposure to its precursors, used in products including food contact paper and stain resistant carpet and textile coatings, is uncertain and varies among individuals (D'eon and Mabury, 2011b; Gebbink et al., 2015a). Other classes of precursor molecule s, some of which are known or suspected to be metabolically converted to PFOA in humans, have also been detected in human serum (Lee and Mabury, 2011). Some of these precursor compounds are known to be present in consumer products at much higher levels than PFOA itself (Lee and Mabury, 2011). Efforts have been made to model the relative contributions of consumer products, indoor and outdoor air, house dust, diet, and/or other sources to exposures of PFOA and other PFCs in the general population. Some of t hese studies estimated the contributions of precursors (Fromme et al., 2008; Vestergren and Cousins, 2009: Gebbink et al., 2015b) while others did not (Washburn et al., 2005; Tittlemeier et al., 2007; Trudel et al., 2008; Cornelius et al., 2012); a high le vel of uncertainty is associated with the precursor estimates. Most of these studies predict that diet is the predominant exposure source. Typical adult total exposures of about 2- 3 ng/kg/day in Europe or North American were estimated in several studies (Fromme et al., 2009; Trudel et al., 2008; Vestergren and Cousins, 2009), while some more recent studies give higher dietary estimates (6.1 ng/kg/day in Flanders, Belgium; Cornelis et al., 2012) or lower dietary estimates (0.6 ng/kg/day in Norway, Haug et al., 2010a; 0.2 ng/kg/day in The Netherlands, Noorlander et al., 2011; 0.16 ng/kg/day (location not specified) , Gebbink et al., 2015b). Such dietary exposure estimates, in general, are highly uncertain because there are relatively few data on PFOA levels in food, analytical methods for food lack sufficient sensitivity, detection limits vary greatly among food types, and PFOA levels differ greatly in samples of the same foods obtained from different sources and/or locations. PFOA has been detected in at least some samples of several types of foods including milk, butter, meats, fish, vegetables (including potatoes), bread, and microwave popcorn, but was not detected in most food samples tested (reviewed by D'Hollander et al., 201 0; Domingo et al., 2012). Com mercially available infant form ula products do not appear to be a major source of exposure to PFOA or other PFCs in the U.S. Tao et al. (2008a) evaluated PFCs in 21 sa mples of five brands of infant formula representing >99% of the U.S. market. Products tested included milk-, organic - and soy-based formula, packed in cans, glass, or plastic, in liquid, powdered, and concentrated 41 liquid form s. PFOA was not detected (<0.048 ng/L) in any sample. Other PFCs (for which detection levels varied) were also not detected or were infrequently found (PFOS - one detection at 11.3 (PFHxS)-two at up to 3.59 ng/L). In this study, PFCs were also analyzed in 12 sam ples of 11 brands of dairy m ilk purchased in Albany, NY in 2008, an there was only one detection of PFHxS at 3.83 ng/L. However, it should be noted that exposure to infants occurs when powdered or concentrated formula is prepared with drinking water contaminated with PFOA. L lorca et al. (2010) analyzed two brands of dry infant cereal and three brands of powdered milk- based infant formula purchased in Spain. PFOA concentrations in the cereals were 166 and 438 ng/kg, and in the formulas, 374, 488, and 723 ng/kg. The concentrations in these products when prepared for consumption were not given. P FOA and other PFCs can be taken up into plants grown on contaminated soil (e.g. from application of PFOA- contaminated biosolids) or irrigated with contaminated water, including into the parts of some vegetables and grains that are consumed by humans and by grazing livestock (Stahl et al., 2009; Lechner and Knapp, 2011; Yoo et al., 2011). The potential for human exposure to PFOA through this route generally depends on the part of the plant that is consumed. In general, shorter chain PFCs are preferentially taken up into the fruit of the plant, while longer chain PFCs such as PFOA are preferentially taken up into the root and shoot parts of the plant (Blaine et al., 2013a, b , 2014; Felizeter et al., 2012, 2014). In the C8 Health Study population, consumption of locally grown or home grown vegetables was associated with higher serum PFOA levels (Emmett et al., 2006 a; Steenland et al., 2009a; Hoffman et al., 2011). P FOA is much less bioaccumulative in fish than other PFCs that have a longer fluorinated carbon chain, including PFOS (Conder et al., 2008). Thus, consumption of fish from waterways contaminated with PFOA does not result in the high exposures typical of other persistent organic contaminants, including PFOS, which are bioaccumulative in fish (H\u00f6lzer et al., 2011). However, PFOA has been detected in edible fish and other seafood, and consumption of aquatic organisms may represent a significant portion of total dietary exposure in some populations (Haug et al., 2010 b; Zhang et al., 2011). S everal studies suggest that PFOA and its precursors in indoor air and/or house dust may be a major exposure source for some individuals (Haug et al., 2011; Shoeib et al., 2011; Schlummer et al., 2013; Gebbink et al., 2015a). Fraser et al. (2013) report ed that the concentration of the PFOA precursor 8:2 FTOH in indoor air in offices is a predictor of serum PFOA concentration. Levels of this compound were greatly elevated in offices with new carpets compared to other offices. 42 Greater exposures to PFOA may occur in young children than in older individuals because of age-specific behaviors such as greater drinking water and food consumption on a body weight basis, hand- to-mouth behavior resulting in greater ingestion of house dust, and more time spent on floors where treated carpets are found (Section 5.1; Trudel et al., 2008; Shoeib et al., 2011). O ccupational exposure to PFOA is believed to occur primarily through inhalat ion (Vestergren and Cousins, 2009). Exposures from drinking water It is well established that s erum PFOA concentrations are greatly elevated in communities with highly contaminated drinking water resulting from environmental discharges (discussed in Biomonitoring, above). As discussed in Biomonitoring (above) and Toxicokinetics (below), continued exposure to even relatively lower drinking water concentrations which are more widespread (Section 3 above) can also substantially increase total human expos ure, as indicated by serum PFOA levels. T he total exposure studies discussed above provide varying conclusions about the relative importance of drinking water to total exposure; these conclusions are highly dependent on the concentration of PFOA in dri nking water assumed in the analyses. For example, Fromme et al. (2008) and Cornelis et al. (2012) concluded that drinking water contributed <1% to total exposure, assuming drinking water levels of 1 ng/L and 2 ng/L, respectively, while Noorlander et al. (2011) estimated that 55% of exposure comes from drinking water, assuming 9 ng/L. Vestergren and Cousins (2009) and Thompson et al. (2011) demonstrated that the contribution of drinking water to total exposure depends on the concentration of PFOA , and Thompson et al. (2011) predict ed that a drinking water level of 9.66 ng/L contributed 24% to total exposure. PFOA exists in drinking water in its non- volatile anionic form, and the formation of inhalable water droplets during showering or bathing is minimal. Therefore, i nhalation exposure is not expected to be significant from non- ingestion uses of drinking water such as showering, bathing, laundry, and dishwashing (Trudel et al., 2008; USEPA, 2016e). In contrast, these are important exposure routes for volatile drinking water contaminants. Similarly, dermal absorption of PFO A during showering, bathing , or swimming is not expected to be significant compared to exposure through ingestion, based on analysis by NJDOH (2014) using skin permeability data from Franko et al. (2012). TOXICOKINETICS Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Summary PFOA is well absorbed orally, and can also be absorbed dermally and by inhalation. T he ammonium (APFO) or sodium (NaPFO) salt s dissociate to PFOA ( the anionic form) in the body. 43 PFOA is water soluble and distributes primarily to the liver and serum, and, to a lesser degree, to the kidney. Unlike most other bioaccumulative organic compounds, it does not distribute to fat. In the serum, PFOA is almost totally bound to albumin and other proteins. Since it is chemically non-reactive, it is not metabolized. The rate of excretion of PFOA varies widely among species, and in som e cases between males and females of the same species. The excretion rate is largely dependent on the extent of secretion and reabsorption by organic anion transporters in the kidney. In humans, the half- life is several years, and half -lives in male and female mice and male rats are days to weeks, so that PFOA reaches steady -state in these species /genders after continued dosing. However, PFOA is rapidly excreted in female rats (half -life of 2-4 hours) and does not reach steady -state after continued once-daily dosing. For this reason, the rat is not an ideal model for studying developmental effects of PFOA. Because of the large variation s in half- lives, the internal dose resulting from a given administered dose varies widely among species and, in some ca ses, genders of the same species. For this reason, interspecies (e.g. animal -to- human) comparisons are made on the basis of internal dose, as indicated by serum level, rather than administered dose. Absorption PFOA is well absorbed by the oral route (Lau et al., 2007). More than 95% of a single dose of 0.1 to 25 mg/kg APFO (the ammonium salt of PFOA) was absorbed in male and female rats (Kemper, 2003 ). It was also well absorbed in mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits in studies by Hundley et al. (2006). About 98.7% of an oral dose given to pregnant rats on gestation day (GD) 8 or 9 was excreted in the urine within 24 hours (Gibson and Johnson, 1983). Additionally, a recent study in mice (Fujii et al., 2015) estimated the oral absorption of PFOA as 98.7% i n males and 99.8% in females. The extent of oral absorption was determined by comparing fecal excretion after intravenous dosing (representing biliary excretion of PFOA both unabsorbed PFOA and biliary excretion). PFOA is well absorbed by humans exposed orally, as demonstrated by elevated serum concentrations in residents of communities with contaminated drinking water (discussed above). P FOA penetrated rat and human skin in an in vitro system (Fasano et al., 2005), and dermal exposure caused liver toxicity in rats (Kennedy, 1985) and immune effects in mice (Fairley et al., 2007). The dermal permeability coefficient ng/L [14 \u00b5g/L] in was estimated as 8.8 x 10 -5 cm/hr (Fasano et al., 2005). As above, dermal absorption is not expected to be a significant source of exposure from contaminated drinking water (NJDOH, 2014). I nhalation exposure to APFO in rats caused hepatic effects (Kennedy et al., 1986). Elevated serum levels of PFOA in workers in facilities making or using PFOA are likely to result primarily from inhalation exposure (Olsen, 2015). As above, PFOA does not volatilize from 44 water, and inhalation is not expected to be a significant source of exposure from contaminated drinking water (Trudel et al., 2008; USEPA, 2016e ). Distribution After oral administration, the highest concentrations of PFOA are found in the liver and serum, followed by the kidney, with lower concentrations in other organs (Vanden Heuvel et al., 1991; Kemper, 2003; Hundley et al., 2006; Fujii et al., 2015). After in utero exposure to mice, PFOA persisted in bone until adulthood (Koskela et al., 2016). In the serum, PFOA is almost totally bound to albumin and other proteins (SRI, 2003: Han, 2003). Unlike many other persistent bioaccumulative compounds, PFOA does not distribute to fat, and the concentrations of PFOA in the fat after dosing are very low (Vanden Heuvel et al., 1991; Hundley et al., 2006; Fujii et al., 2015). T he fraction of the dose found in the liver is dose- dependent and varies between male and female animals. For example, in male rats two hours after a single intravenous dose, 52% of a low dose (0.041 mg/kg) and 27% of a higher dose (16.56 mg/kg) w ere found in liver (Kudo et al., 2007). Serum concentrations were similar in male and female CD-1 mice after a single oral gavage dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg PFOA (Lou et al., 2009). However, the concentration in the liver was higher in male s than in females. I n another study in which rats were given a single dose of 25 mg/kg, the absolute concentrations in the livers of males were higher than in females, as expected based on the slower excretion by male rats (see below), and th e percentage of PFOA in the cytosolic fraction of the liver was higher in females (49%) than in males (26%) (Han et al., 2005). T he subcellular distribution within the liver of male rats was also found to be dose-dependent (Kudo et al., 2007). Over 40% of a low dose (0.041 mg/kg) distributed to the 8000xg pellet (nuclei, mitochondria, and cellular debris), followed by lysosomes and peroxisomes, microsomes, with the least amount found in cytosol (less than 5%), while over 43% of a higher dose (16.56 mg/kg) distributed to cytosol, followed by the 8000xg pellet, lysosomes and peroxisomes, and microsomes. In another part of this study using a range of doses, there was a dose-dependent increase in the percentage found in cytosol. Metabolism PFOA is chemicall y unreactive due to its carbon-fluorine bonds, one of the strongest found in organic chemistry (Vaalgamaa et al., 2011 . Therefore, it is not metabolized by biological systems. 45 Excretion PFOA is excreted in the urine and the feces, and the proportion in the urine versus the feces varies among species (Hundley et al., 2006; Cui et al., 2010). It is believed that PFOA undergoes enterohepatic circulation (Kudo and Kawashima, 2003) since oral administration of cholestyramine (an anion exchange resin which is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract) increased the fecal elimination of PFOA in male rats by 10-fold (Johnson et al., 1984). D ata from several studies indicate that blood loss (e.g. through menstruation, blood donation, or venesection) is an additional excretion route for PFCs (Harada 2009; MDH, 2013; Taylor et al., 2014; Lorber et al., 2015) T he half -life of PFOA varies among species, and it also differs between males and females in some species, most notably rats and hamsters ( Table 4; Hundley et al., 2006, Lau et al., 2007). PFOA is excreted much more quickly in female rats (t 1/2 = 2-4 hours) than in male rats (t 1/2 = 4-6 days), while the excretion rate in hamsters is much more rapid in males than in females. The half-life in both sexes of mice is similar (17 days in females and 19 days in male s), while excretion is rapid in both sexes of rabbits with half- lives of 5.5 hours in male s and 7 hours in females. T he difference s in excretion rates between species and between male and female rats are thought to be due to variations in renal clearance rates. These rates are controlled by specific organic anion transporters that are responsible for the active transport (secretion or reabsorption) of many organic anions, including endogenous substances and xenobiotics, across membranes in several organs including the kidney (Weaver et al., 2010; Han et al., 2012). The specific transporters believed to be responsible for renal reabsorption of PFOA have been identified in male rats as Oatp1a1 and in humans as OAT4 and URAT1 (Han et al., 2012). 46 Table 4: Serum/plasma elimination half -lives of PFOA Species Females Males References Rat 2-4 hours 4-6 days Johnson et al.

Less exposed group: 8.5 years (initial 9 years post- exposure); no apparent decline (>9 years post-exposure). Seals et al. (2011) Adapted from Lau, 2012 Re nal excretion of PFOA appears to be under hormonal control (Ylinen et al., 1989; Kudo et al., 2002). Kudo et al. (2002) found that the clearance of PFOA in female rats (15 ml/min/kg) is greater than the glomerular filtration rate (10 ml/min/kg), suggesting that PFOA is actively excreted through renal tubular secretion, while the renal clearance was much lower in male rats, 0.6 ml/min/kg (Kudo et al., 2002). Castration of male rats increased the clearance to a rate similar to that in females, and this incr ease was reversed by administration of testosterone to the castrated rats (Ylinen et al., 1989; Kudo et al., 2002). Administration of estradiol to male rats increased the renal excretion of PFOA, and administration of testosterone to female rats reduced the clearance to a rate similar to that of male controls (Ylinen et al., 1989; Kudo et al., 2002). Probenecid, an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic anions, greatly reduced the clearance of PFOA in female and castrated male rats, but had little effect on the excretion rate in control male rats (Hanhijarvi et al., 1982; Kudo et al., 2002). 47 The gender-dependent differences in excretion rate in rats appear to develop between 3 and 5 weeks of age (Hinderliter et al., 2006). At 4 weeks of age, serum concentrations 24 hours after a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg PFOA were similar (within 3 -fold) in male and female rats, while at 5 weeks and older, serum levels were at least 30 -fold higher in males than in females receiving the same dose. This greater difference in older rats resulted from age-dependent changes in both males and female. A t 5 weeks of age or older, serum levels in males at this dose we re about 5- fold higher than serum levels at 4 weeks, while serum levels in females 5 weeks or older are 2-3 fold lower than at 4 weeks of age. Human half -life The half -life of PFOA in humans is several years and does not appear to differ significantly between males and females. Inter -individual differences in half- life may be due to differences in renal transport by OATs. A mean half -life of 3.8 years was estimated from data from 26 retired workers with occupational exposure, with no difference found between men and women (Olsen et al., 2007). Bartell et al (2010a) estimated a half-life of 2.3 years in a more heterogeneous study population consisting of 200 adults exposed to PFOA in drinking water. This estimate was based on average decreases in serum level of 26% and 24% for a one- year period after treatment to remove PFOA was initiated in two water districts contaminated by PFOA emissions from a West Virginia manufacturing facility. There was no evidence of age - or gender -dependence in elimination rates in this study. During the second year of follow-up of the same individuals, serum PFOA levels decreased more slowly (9% and 15% in the two water districts), suggesting either ongoing exposures from sources other than residential drinking water or that kinetics do not follow first-order elimination (Bartell et al., 2010b). S eals et al. (2011) studied t he rate of decline of serum PFOA levels in former residents of Little Hocking (n = 602) and Lubeck (n = 971), the two water districts with the highest drinking water PFOA levels of the six districts included in the C8 Health Study. Median serum levels in current and former residents of Little Hocking (current residents, 241.0 ng/ml; former residents regardless of years elapsed , 60.6 ng/ml) were much higher than in Lubeck (current residents, 69.4 ng/ml; former residents regardless of years elapsed , 31.0 ng/ ml), due to the much higher drinking water PFOA concentrations in Little Hocking than Lubeck. The number of years elapsed since the former residents moved and thus stopped consuming contaminated water ranged from less than one year to almost 25 years. The data on the relationship between years elapsed since moving and serum PFOA levels suggest that PFOA elimination is biphasic and dependent on serum concentration. In former residents of Little Hocking, the half-life was 2.9 years for the first 4 elapsed years, and about 8.5 years after the first 4 elapsed years. In former residents of Lubeck, the half-life was about 8.5 years for the first 9 elapsed years, with no apparent decline in serum levels after 9 elapsed years. 48 PFOA levels in serum of exposed individuals were also studied in Arnsberg, Germany, where the Moehne River which is used a drinking water source was contaminated by runoff from PFOA - contaminated industrial waste applied to agricultural land (Brede et al., 2010). In a two- year study of 138 individuals before and after drinking water treatment removal was initiated, the geometric mean PFOA plasma levels declined by 39% in children and mothers , and by 26% in men; the geometric mean half -life was estimated as 3.26 years. Isomer -specific kin etics PFOA exists as a mixture of linear and branched isomers, and the isomer profile varies depending on the manufacturing process used. PFOA made by the telomerization process is primarily linear, while PFOA produced by electrochemical fluorination consists of a mixture of linear and branched isomers. Differences in the rates of elimination of the isomers have been investigated (Loveless et al., 2006; DeSilva et al., 2009). Loveless et al. (2006) reported that, after equivalent doses, serum levels of branched PFOA were lower than for linear PFOA in rats and mice. Similarly, after subchronic administration to rats, most branched isomers were eliminated more quickly than linear PFOA, with the exception of two minor unidentified branched isomers which had half -lives about twice that of linear PFOA (DeSilva et al., 2009). In humans, branched isomers were also more rapidly eliminated than linear isomers (Zhang et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2015). PFOA isomer profiles differed in maternal and cord serum within human infant-mother pairs, indicating that most branched isomers cross the placenta more efficiently than the linear forms (Beesoon et al. , 2011). I t has recently been reported that linear PFOA has a higher binding affinity than branched PFOA for human serum albumin and serum proteins in general, providing a potential explanation for the more rapid excretion of branched isomers of PFOA (Beesoon and Martin, 2015). Toxicokinetics Relevant to Developmental Exposures Summary It is important to consider toxicokinetics relevant to developmental exposures of PFOA in detail. Developmental effects are the most sensitive known endpoints for PFOA toxicity in experimental animals, and prenatal exposure is associated with decreased fetal growth in humans (see To xicology and Epidemiology sections, below). T he toxicokinetics of PFOA during gestation and lactation have been studied in rats and mice but have not been evaluated in non-human primates. In rodents, PFOA is present in fetuses of dosed dams, as well as in the placenta and amniotic fluid. PFOA is also present in the breast milk of gestationally exposed dams. B ecause it is excreted very quickly in female rats but very slowly in humans, the rat is not an ideal model for study of developmental effects of PFOA. In contrast, the mouse is a preferable 49 model for evaluation of developmental effects because PFOA is excreted slowly in female mice. For this reason, many recent developmental studies have been conducted in mice. I n humans, PFOA has been measured in amniotic fluid, maternal serum, umbilical cord blood, and breast milk. PFOA concentrations are similar in maternal serum and umbilical cord blood serum, which is reflective of serum levels in the newborn. PFOA exposure in breast-fed infants is greatest during the first few months of life because both PFOA concentrations in breast milk and the rate of fluid consumption are highest during this time period. As a result, serum PFOA concentrations in breast- fed infants increase several fold from levels at birth within the first few months of life. Exposures to infants who consume formula prepared with contaminated water are also highest during this time period. The se greatly elevated exposures during the first months of life are of special concern because the neonatal period is a sensitive time period for the toxicological effects of PFOA. Rats As discussed above, PFOA is excreted very rapidly by female rats (half -life of 2 -4 hours). Because of its rapid excretion, PFOA is not continuously present in female rats dosed once daily, and the fetuses are thus not exposed continuously to PFOA from such a dosing regimen. Because PFOA is highly persistent in humans, the rat is not an ideal model for evaluation of developmental effects of PFOA. I n female rats given a single oral dose of PFOA, the maximum plasma concentration occurred about 1.25 hours after dosing (Kemper and Jepson, 2003). About 98.7% of an oral dose given to pregnant rats on gestation day (GD) 8 or 9 was excreted in the urine within 24 hours (Gibson and Johnson, 1983). K inetics of PFOA were studied in pregnant rats (strain not stated) dosed once daily by gavage with 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day on GD 4 to postnatal day ( PND) 21, and their pups (Hinderliter et al., 2005). Because the gender difference in kinetics in rats develops at about 5 weeks of age (Hinderliter et al., 2006), plasma levels were similar in male and female pups until PND 21, the time period evaluated in this study. Plasma was taken from the dams 2 hours after dosing to allow maximum detection of PFOA, since virtually all PFOA is excreted within 24 hours after dosing of female rats. Mean PFOA concentrations in maternal plasma approximately 2 hours after doses of 3 , 10, or 30 mg/kg were 11,000, 27,000, and 67,000 ng/ml, respectively. On GD 21, levels in fetal plasma were about half of those in the dams. Concentrations in milk were fairly constant on PND 3 through PND 21, and were about 10- fold lower than maternal serum levels. Pup plasma levels were about 4 -fold lower than maternal plasma levels on PND 3, and about 10- fold lower at later time points. PFOA was also detected in the placenta and amniotic fluid. Interpretation of these data is complicated by the fact that maternal plasma levels varied 50 widely during the course of the day betw een the daily doses, and milk and fetal/pup levels are compared to maternal plasma levels in samples taken near their daily peaks. Mice In contrast to female rats, PFOA is slowly excreted in female mice with a half -life of several weeks (discussed above) . Therefore, the fetus is continuously exposed when pregnant mice are dosed once daily. Because PFOA is persistent in humans, the mouse is a preferable model for evaluation of PFOA's developmental effects than the rat, and many recent developmental studi es have been conducted in mice. Fenton et al. (2009) studied the disposition of PFOA in pregnant CD -1 mice and their pups after a single oral gavage dose of 0.1, 1, or 5 mg/kg on GD 17. On GD 18 prior to delivery, the PFOA concentration in the amniotic fluid was about half of the concentration in maternal serum . PFOA concentrations in the whole pup on GD 18 were similar to those in maternal serum . On PND 1 (the earliest time at which serum was measured in pups), pup serum PFOA concentrations were about 1.5 times the concentrations in maternal serum. The exposure of pups at this stage was thought by the authors to result primarily from in utero exposure rather than through lactation. PFOA concentrations in maternal serum and in aspirated milk follo wed a U -shaped curve over time between PND 1 (serum) or PND 2 (milk) and PND 18, with decreases between the earliest time point ( PND 1 or 2 ) and mid- lactation (PND 8, pups, and PND 11, milk), and increases from mid-lactation to PND 18. This increase betwe en PND 8 and 18 was thought to result from decreased dilution of maternal serum and milk at PND 18. PFOA concentrations in pup serum and in whole pups decreased over time from postnatal day 1 to 18 on a ng/ml or ng/g basis, while the total PFOA pup body burden increased from GD 18 to PND 8, and decreased between PND 8 and 18, presumably because the intake of milk has decreased during this period. Milk concentrations were lower than maternal serum concentrations at all doses and time points, ranging from 1 1% to 56% of the serum concentration, with the higher percentages at early and late lactation time points. Serum PFOA concentrations in lactating CD -1 mouse dams and their pups were also measured in a cross -fostering study of mammary gland developmental effects (White at al., 2009) in which dams were treated by gavage with 5 mg/kg/day from GD 8 -17. After birth, litters of similar ages and exposures were mixed and fostered, resulting in four treatment groups: untreated dam with unexposed pup, treated dam with unexposed pup, untreated dam with pup exposed during gestation, and treated dam with pups exposed during gestation. Consistent with the single dose study (Fenton et al., 2009), serum PFOA levels on PND 1 in pups exposed in utero were about 50% higher than in treated dams. On PND 1, PFOA in the pups is primarily attributable to in utero exposure, rather than lactational exposure during the first postnatal day, since serum PFOA concentrations in pups not exposed in utero but nursing on treated dams wer e only about 3% of 51 the concentrations in pups exposed in utero. Serum levels in treated dams and pups decreased between PND 1 and PND 10, with a greater decrease in pups exposed in utero that nursed from untreated dams than in pups exposed in utero that nursed from treated dams. Serum levels from pups not exposed in utero that nursed from treated dams rose over time, and by PND 10 serum levels in these pups were similar to levels in the treated dams they nursed from. Interestingly, serum levels in untreated dams that nursed pups exposed in utero increased between PND 1 and PND 10, presumably due to maternal behavior (grooming, and ingestion of urine and feces) resulting in ingestion of PFOA from the pups. In a more recent study of effects on mammary gland development from lower doses of PFOA (Macon et al., 2011), pregnant CD-1 mice were dosed by gavage on GD 10 to 17 with 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg/day. At PND 1, serum levels in the pups were 24, 285, 2304, and 16,306 ng/ml in the untreated , 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively. The pup serum levels decreased over time to 3, 17, 132, and 2683 ng/ml at PND 21. Maternal serum levels were not measured by Macon et al. (2011). However, in other studies in whi ch serum data are available for dams and pups within the same study (e.g. Fenton et al., 2009) , serum levels on PND 1 were higher in pups than dams. White et al. (2011) provide data on serum PFOA concentrations in CD-1 dams and female pups exposed to 5000 ng/L (5 g/L) PFOA in drinking water over multiple generations. Results of this study are discussed in the section on Developmental Effects . Exposure began in P0 dams on GD 7 and continued throughout the F1 and F2 generations (except during F1 breedin g and early gestation, to avoid exposing control males). Serum concentrations were 74.8 ng/ml in the P0 dams and 86.09 ng/ml in the F1 dams at weaning on PND 22, as compared to 4 and 2 ng/ml, respectively, in the corresponding control groups of dams . At this time point, the P0 dams had been exposed for about 32 days and the F1 dams had been exposed throughout their lifetimes beginning in utero, except during breeding and early gestation. As discussed below, serum concentrations in humans with ongoing exposure PFOA in drinking water are, on average, more than 100-fold higher than the concentration in drinking water. Thus, the serum PFOA concentrations in the mice exposed to 5000 ng/ml (5 g/L) in drinking water are much lower than the average serum concentrations of more than 500 ng/ml expected in humans chronically exposed to this drinking water concentration. Ser um PFOA concentrations were similar in F1 and F2 pups, and concentrations in the pups were lower than in the dams at weaning . The serum concentration s in the F1 and F2 pups at PND 22 were 21.3 and 26.6 ng/ml, respectively; at PND 42, they were 48.9 and 57.4 ng/ml; and at PND 63, they were 66.2 and 68.4 ng.ml. 52 Humans Relationship between maternal and fetal/neonatal exposures PFOA has been detected in umbilical cord blood serum in studies of the general population worldwide. In seven studies reviewed by Post et al. (2012) in which both maternal and cord blood were analyzed, the mean cord blood serum:maternal serum (or plasma) ratio ranged from 0.68:1 to 1.26:1, with a mean ratio of less than 1:1 in all but one study. However, cord:maternal serum (or plasma) ratios for some individual neonate- maternal pairs within these studies were greater than 1:1. Since umbilical cord serum (or plas ma) is reflective of neonatal serum (or plasma), these data indicate that serum (or plasma) levels are generally similar in the neonate and the mother. A more recent review by Kato et al. (2015) that evaluated 12 studies in total also concluded that the maternal:cord serum ratios for PFOA is approximately 1:1. Exposure to infants through breast milk and infant formula PFOA is detected in human breast milk worldwide (reviewed by Liu et al., 2010; White et al., 2011a; Post et al., 2012). Factors which may potentially affect the concentration of PFOA in breast milk include whether the mother has previously nursed other infants and how soon after birth the sample is taken (Tao et al., 2008a; Haug et al., 2011; Thomsen et al., 2010). Thomsen et al. (2010) found that average breast milk concentrations were highest initially and decreased by about 7.7% per month, or about 94% during the first year of breast feeding, presumably due to decreased maternal body burden resulting from excretion into breast milk. Br east milk PFOA concentrations were reported to be about 1% of mean general population serum levels by Tao et al. (2008a), and to be 2.5% and 9% of median maternal serum levels by Kim et al. (2011) and Liu et al. (2011), respectively. These data suggest a breast milk:maternal serum ratio of about 1:100 to 1:11. Based on a breast milk: maternal serum ratio of greater than or equal to 1:100 (Tao et al., 2008a; Kim et al., 2011; Liu et al, 2011) and a serum:drinking water ratio of greater than or equal to 100:1 (discussed below), the initial PFOA concentration in breast milk is expected to be greater than or equal to the concentration in the maternal drinking water source (Post et al., 2012) . E xposures to infants to PFOA from breast milk or formula are higher than in older individuals exposed to the same concentration of PFOA in drinking water. Mean breast milk consumption is 150 ml/kg/day during the first post- partum month when PFOA levels in breast milk are highest (Thomsen et al., 2010), and it is 83 ml/kg/day from 6 -12 months of age (USEPA, 2008a). Similarly , the mean drinking water intakes in infants who consume drinking water (e.g. in formula prepared with wat er) are 137 ml/kg/day from birth to 1 month of age, and 53 ml/kg/day at 6-12 months of age (USEPA, 2011b). These fluid intakes are much higher than the mean drinking water consumption rates in lactating women, 26 ml/kg/day (USEPA, 2011b) , and the general population (11 years of age or older), 13 ml/kg/day (USEPA, 20 08a). Although breast milk or 53 formula consumption on a body weight basis decreases as the infant gets older, it remains much higher than adult water consumption throughout infancy . As noted above, serum PFOA levels are similar in newborns and in their mothers. Several studie s, summarized below, have consistently demonstrated that serum PFOA concentrations in breast -fed infants increase by several fold during the first few months of life, presumably because both breast milk PFOA concentrations and intake of breast milk on a body weight basis are highest during this time period. Infants fed with formula prepared with contaminated drinking water also receive the greatest exposures during the first few months of life because the rate of fluid intake is highest then. Serum PFOA levels were measured in umbilical cord blood at delivery and at 6 month and 19 months of age in infants from the German general population (Fromme et al., 2010). Average body burdens, as indicated by serum levels, were increased, typically by several -fold, from birth to 6 months by exposure through breast milk. Levels declined between 6 months and 19 months, a time point at which breast feeding had stopped or was decreased, but remained higher at 19 months than at birth (Figure 5). Figure 5. PFOA concentration in cord blood and blood collected in infants around six and nineteen months after birth (Fromme et al., 2010) Duration of breastfeeding was also associated with higher serum PFOA concentrations in infants (n=49) from a community with PFOA -contaminated drinking water (the C8 Health Study). The increases were estimated as 6% per month of breastfeeding and 96% for one year of breastfeeding (Mondal et al., 2014). The authors noted that these values may underestimate the actual increases from exposure through breastfeeding, because they are based on comparisons to non-breastfed infants from the same communities who may also have had increased serum PFOA concentrations from exposures vi a formula prepared with contaminated drinking water. 54 S imilarly, a study of Faroese infants (n= 80) with serum PFOA data at birth and 11, 18, and 60 months estimated an increase in serum PFOA concentrations of about 28% per month during the period of exclusive breast feeding (median of 4.5 months in the study group) and about 4% per month during the period of partial breast feeding (median of 4 additional months) (Mogensen et al., 2015). Serum PFOA concentration did not increase in non- breastfed (e.g. form ula-fed) infants; presumably, the drinking water in this location was not contaminated with PFOA. Data for 12 infants from the study are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Serum PFOA concentrations over time in 12 infants from Mogensen et al. (2015). F inally, Verner et al. (2016a,b ) developed a pharmacokinetic model that predicts PFOA doses and plasma levels in breastfed infants and children, and their mothers. Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict the distribution of child:mother ratios for doses and plasma level s starting at birth (Figure 7). Doses (ng/kg/day) to infants were much higher than in their mothers during the first year of life. T he infant:mother dose ratio peaked right after birth, with a median ratio of about 75:1 and a maximum of 231:1, and declined thereafter (Figure 7, right side). The infant:mother plasma level ratio peaked during the first year of life, with predicted ratios of 4.5- fold (median), 7.8-fold (95th percentile), and 15.3- fold (maximum) higher plasma PFOA concentr ations in infants than in their mothers during the period of greatest infant exposure (Figure 7, left side). 55 Figure 7. Monte Carlo simulations (n = 10 000) of child/mother ratios of plasma PFOA levels (ng/ ml; right side of figure ) and doses (ng/kg/day; left side of figure) for a breastfeeding period of 30 months . The black line represents the 50th percentile, the blue line represents the 5th percentile, the red line represents the 95th percentile, and the dotted lines represent min imum and maximum values (Verner et al., 2016 a,b). While peak serum PFOA concentrations occur during the first year of life, levels remain elevated for at least several additional years. Serum PFOA levels in children up to age 5 (or older) were higher than in adults in communities exposed through contaminated drinking water (Emmett et al., 2006a; Steenland et al., 2009a; Mondal et al., 2012, discussed above). In the study of Faroese children (Mogensen et al., 2015), serum PFOA levels declined after their peak in infancy but remained elevated above initial levels at birth until at least age 5 years, the last time point assessed. Similarly, the model developed by Verner et al. (2016a ) predicts that plasma PFOA concentrations will remain several fold higher tha n at birth until at least age 3 years, the last time point modeled. I n summary, both breast -fed and formula- fed infants receive much greater exposures to PFOA from contaminated drinking water (directly or indirectly) than older individuals. Serum PFOA levels peak during the first year of life and remain elevated for several years. The se elevated exposures during early life are of special concern because effects from neonatal exposure are sensitive endpoints for the toxicity of PFOA. Relationship between administered dose and internal dose Repeated Dose Animal Studies Information on kinetics in repeated dose animal studies was reviewed by Post et al. (2012). At higher doses, the kinetics of PFOA in rodents and primates (Griffith and Long, 1980; Ylinen et al., 1990; Mylchreest, et Loveless et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2006; Das et al., 2010) are not consistent with one- compartment or simple first- order models (Anderson et al., 2006; Clewell, 2009). Serum levels did not increase proportionally with increasing dose, except at lower doses in some studies. Additionally, steady- state was reached more rapidly at high doses than predicted by classical kinetics (4 to 5 half -lives). 56 H owever, at lower doses closer to those relevant to human environmental exposures, kinetics are consistent with first order processes, and serum levels are proportional to administered dose (Clewell, 2009; Lou et al., 2009; Loveless et al., 2006; Das et al., 2010). Available data indicate that serum levels in mice from doses below the administered range can be estimated by linear extrapolation from data on doses of 1 mg/kg/day or lower. The kinetics are consistent with the saturation of OATs responsible for renal reabsorption at high doses, resulting in a higher excretion rate at high doses than at low doses (Anderson et al., 2006; Clewell, 2009). Human studies Relationship between drinking water and serum concentrations in exposed communities In communities with drinking water contamina ted by PFOA, mean and median serum PFOA levels higher than in the general population. Variations in serum PFOA concentrations among individuals using the same source of drinking water arise from inter-individual differences in daily water consumption rate s (L/kg/day) and/or toxicokinetic factors . The relationship between drinking w ater concentration and serum concentration has been extensively evaluated for PFOA. It is well established that ongoing hum an exposure to PFOA in drinking water increases serum levels, on average, by at least 100 times the drinking water concentration . This conclusion is based on data from several studies of populations whose public water supplies or private wells were contam inated with a wide range of PFOA concentrations (60 ng/L to 13,300 ng/L ). In 282 residents of Little Hocking, Ohio at least six years of age exposed for two years or more , with occupationally exposed individuals excluded, the median ratio between the PFOA concentration in serum (371 range, 62:1 -162:1), with a higher median ratio in young children (Emmett et al., 2006a). T his approximate 100:1 central tendency value for the serum:drinking water ratio was confirmed in communities with lower drinking water PFOA concentrations (Post et al., 2009a) based on data from approximately 70,000 residents of Little Hocking and five other Ohio and West Virginia water districts, when background serum levels found in the general population from non-water sources of exposure were taken into account. Drinking water levels in four of these districts were in the range of about 60 ng/L to 400 ng/L, while levels in a fifth district and Little Hocking were higher (Anderson-Mahoney et al., 2008). A dditionally, Hoffman et al. (2011) studied the relationship between drinking water concentrations and serum levels in the same region of Ohio and West Virginia in a study of 108 individuals using 62 private wells, with 1 to 4 participants using each well. Since the PFOA concentrations differ ed in each private well, this study included a greater range of drinking water 57 concentrations than studies of the six affected public water districts in this vicinity. The median and mean PFOA levels in the wells were 200 ng/ L and 800 ng/L, respectively, and the maximum concentration was 13,300 ng/L. An adjusted robust regression model of the serum and drinking water data provided an estimated serum:drinking water ratio of 141:1 (95% CI: 135:1 - 148:1), while a one- compartmen t pharmacokinetic model based on assumed water intake of 1.41 L/day and half-life of 2.3 years provided an estimated ratio of 114:1. A n approximate ratio of 100:1 or greater between serum and drinking water concentrations is also consistent with observations in 98 Minnesota residents tested 34 months after exposure to contaminated drinking water ended (MDH, 2009), when the expected post -exposure decline in serum levels is considered . A lower serum:drinking water PFOA ratio of approximately 50:1 was observed in a German community whose drinking water source was contaminated with PFOA and other PFCs (H\u00f6lzer et al., 2008). Possible reasons for this difference are the use of bottled water by some participants who were aware of the contamination for up to 6 months before their blood was sampled, uncertainty about the duration and time course of the water contamination, or differences in drinking water consumption patterns between German and U.S. residents. Pharmacokinetic modeling of the relationship between dose and serum concentration Biologically based pharmacokinetic modeling predicts a linear relationship in humans between external dose and internal dose, as measured by serum PFOA level, at doses relevant to environmental exposures such as from contaminated drinking water (Clewell, 2009). Increased serum levels that are linearly proportional to exposure levels have been observed in communities using contaminated drinking water (discussed above). However, non- linear kinetics such as observed in animals at higher doses, may occur at higher (occupational) human exposures (Clewell, 2009). L orber and Egeghy (2011) developed a simple single- compartment pharmacokinetic model that predicts the relationship in humans between PFOA dose (ng/kg/day) and serum concentration (ng/ml) based on volume of distribution and elimination rate, as follows: Serum concentration (ng/ml) = _______________Dose (ng/kg/day) ________________ Volume of distribution (ml/kg) x Elimination rate (day-1) T his model uses a volume of distribution of 170 ml/kg (0.17 L/kg), based on a model calibrated with data from an Australian population exposed to PFOA through drinking water (Thompson et al., 2010), and an elimination rate of 0.0008 day -1, based on the human half- life of 2.3 years observed in the C8 Health Study population (Bartell et al., 2010a). The product of these two values provides a clearance factor that relates serum concentration (ng/ml) to dose (ng/kg/day) of 58 0.14 ml/kg/day (or 0.00014 L/kg/day). It is noted th at the half -life of 2.3 years (Bartell et al., 2010a) is the shortest value reported in the literature (Table 4) and is based on data from a community whose exposure to PFOA in drinking water had ended. Use of the other values reported in the literature ( shown in Table 4) would result in a clearance factor that predicts a higher serum level from a given dose of PFOA. T he USEPA Office of Water (2016a) used the same values for volume of distribution and human half-life (elimination rate) selected by Lorber and Egeghy (2011) to derive the same clearance factor, 0.00014 L/kg/day. This value is very close to the clearance factor of 0.127 ml/kg/day (0.000127 L/kg/day) from the earlier unpublished model developed by Clewell (2006) that is discussed in Post et al. (2012). US EPA (201 6f) present s the following equation, which is equivalent to the equation presented by Lorber and Egeghy (2011) above: Serum Concentration (g/L) x Clearance (1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day) = Human Dose (g/kg/day) The relationship between the concentration of PFOA in drinking water and serum predicted by the clearance Egeghy, 2011; USEPA, 2016a ) was with the empirically observed average ratio of > 100:1 in communities with drinking water exposure to PFOA (discussed above) as follows: The daily dose from a given concentration of PFOA in drinking water is: Human Dose ( \u00b5g/kg/day) 0.016 L/kg/day Where: 0.016 L/kg/day is the mean water ingestion rate in the U.S. (USEPA, 2011b). Therefore: 1.4 10-4 L/kg/day T he serum:drinking water ratio of 114:1 based on the clearance factor and average daily water consumption is consistent with the observed ratios in communities exposed to contaminated drinking water. This calculation verifies that the clearance factor accurately predicts the relationship between human dose and human serum level. The clearance factor can therefore be 59 used in the development of a Reference Dose (RfD) for PFOA from the Target Human Serum Level (RfD in te rms of serum level). Increases i n serum levels associated with PFOA in drinking water The increase in serum PFOA level, on average, expected from ongoing consumption of a given concentration of PFOA in drinking water can be predicted using th e clearance factor, 0.00014 L/kg/day, and an assumed drinking water ingestion rate (L/kg/day). As above, t he half -life of 2.3 y ears used in the clearance factor is shorter than other human half-l ife values reported in the literature (Table 4). Us e of a longer h alf-life value would result in a higher predicted serum PFOA level from a given daily dose or drinking water con centration. The mean daily water ingestion rate in the U.S. is 0.016 L/kg/day (from above), and the daily water ingestion rate based on the uppe r percentile factors (2 L/day water consumption; 70 kg body weight) used to derive Health-based M CLs is 0.029 L/kg/day . For each 10 ng/L in drinking water, on average, ongoing exposure at the mean ingestion and upper percentile ingestion rates are predicted to increase serum PFOA by 1.2 ng/ ml and 2.0 ng/ ml, respectively. Increases i n serum levels f rom various concentrations of PFOA in drinking water, a nd the percent increases from the most r ecent median serum level, 2.1 ng/ml, from NHANES (2011-12; CDC, 2015) are shown in Table 5 a nd Figure 8. Table 5. Increase in serum PFOA concentrations predicted from various concentra tions of PFOA in drinking water Drinking Water Conc.

Increases in serum PFOA concentrations predicted from mean and upper percentile consumption of drinking water with various concentrations of PFOA, as compared to U.S median and 95th percentile serum PFOA levels (NHANES, 2011 -12). I t is evident from T able 5 and Figure 8 that relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water are associated with substantial increases in serum PFOA concentrations; this has recently been observed in a study of serum PFOA levels in individuals served by PWS with PFOA detections in UCMR3 (median UCMR3 detection - 28 ng/L; Hurley et al., 2016). For example, ongoing exposure to 20 ng/L at the upper percentile ingestion rate is predicted to result in a serum concentration of 6.1 ng/ ml, which is above the 95 th percentile i n the U.S population of 5.7 ng/ml (NHANES, 2011-12; CDC, 2015). With a n average (mean ) water ingestion rate, exposure to 40 ng/L is expected to result in an elevation in serum level to 6.7 ng/ml, also above the 95th percentile from NHANES. Additionally, it should be kept in mind that (as discussed above), the increases in serum levels in infants are expected to be several fold higher than those shown in Table 5 and Figure 8. HEALTH EFFECTS - HUMAN STUDIES Overview The epidemiological database for PFOA is much larger than for most other drinking water contaminants, including those previously evaluated by the DWQI. Considering the large body of epidemiologic studies assessing associations with PFOA, the Health Effect s Subcommittee chose 61 to narrow and focus the human health effects section of this report. Studies of selected health endpoints were comprehensively reviewed , while information on other endpoints is summarized in the text. Conclusions of r eviews of selected additional key health endpoints performed by other groups were also evaluated by the Subcommittee and are cited . This method allow ed the Subcommittee to focus its resources while maintaining a high level of scientific review. The basis for selection of endpoints for comprehensive review was largely support ed by a previous detailed evaluation of the scientific literature on PFOA by the Health Effects Subcommittee in 2009- 2010, and a subsequent comprehensive review of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant (Post et al., 2012) . These efforts represent a large amount of work that had already been completed in reviewing information relevant to the development of a Health -based MCL recommendation for PFOA and served as a st arting point for the evalu ation presented in this document. Health endpoints evaluated comprehensively include: serum cholesterol/lipids, liver enzymes/bilirubin and liver disease, uric acid, thyroid function and thyroid disease, and antibody concentrations following vaccination. Some of the f actors considered in selection of these endpoints were the extent and consistency of the data , whether the effect has been observed at exposures relevant to potential drinking water exposures , and evidence for reverse causality . Comprehensive evaluation involve d the review of peer -reviewed studies identified through an a priori literature search and screening criteria. An individual study table summarizing the study design, location, study population characteristics, outcome and exposure asse ssment, study population exposure, statistical methods, results, major limitations which addresses risk of bias , and funding source for each reviewed study can be found in Appendix 4, and tables summarizing all studies of each endpoint are found below. Two other critical endpoints, fetal growth following developmental exposure and cancer, were recently comprehensive ly review ed by other authoritative scientific groups. Review reports by these groups are evaluated and summarized in this document. In total, 54 epidemiological studies assessing associations with s erum cholesterol/lipids , liver enzymes/bilirubin , uric acid , thyroid function and thyroid disease , and/or antibody concentrations following vaccination were evaluated in depth. The studies were conducted on populations in the U.S., Canada, and several European and Asian countries. The studies evaluated the general population, communities with drinking water contaminated with PFOA, and occupationally -expo sed workers, thereby assessing health effects over a wide range of PFOA exposures and serum concentrations. In human environmental health effect studies in general, confounding by co -exposure to contaminants other than the one being evaluated may be parti cularly important since it may bias results. In some instances, PFOA has been shown to be strongly correlated with other co-62 occurring PFCs which may not have been controlled for, and the same may be true for other environmental contaminants. This confounding bias could impact studies in any type of population, but may play a more important role in occupational populations which may be more likely than the general population to be exposed to co-occurring contaminants at meaningful levels. In general, co- expo sure to other chemicals could also be more likely in communities where there are high levels of environmental contamination. However, this is not likely the case in the C8 Health Project, a large community study of populations with drinking water exposure to PFOA (discussed in more detailed below), since PFOA is the only contaminant that was reported to be present at elevated levels in drinking water or other environmental media. A s is the case for epidemiologic studies of environmental contaminants in general, the nature of these observational epidemiology studies, in contrast to experimental studies , limits our ability to definitively conclude that PFOA causes health effects. However, the findings from observational epidemiology studies are useful in assessing consistency, strength of association, exposure-response, temporality, specificity, and biologic plausibility - criteria which are useful in assessing causation. Studies of Exposure L evels F ound in the G eneral Population For the endpoints that were comprehensively reviewed, the majority of studies evaluated the general population and/or study populations with general population-level exposures to PFOA. Twenty nine (29) studies with general population, low- level exposures were identified. The serum PFOA concentrations ( based on a measure of central tendency , which was presented as median, mean, or geometric mean) in these studies range from 0.9 to 7.1 ng/ ml. A strength of the general population studies is their use of ser um PFOA levels as the basis for exposure assessment. Because of the long human half -life of PFOA, serum levels do not rapidly fluctuate with short term variations in exposure, and serum levels taken at a single time therefore reflect long-term exposures. Serum levels thus provide an accurate measure of internal exposure for each study participant, an advantage over studies based on external exposure metrics such as drinking water concentrations. Among these studies, the large majority are cross- sectional ( 23 studies, plus one which includes a cross- sectional component). A general limitation of cross -sectional studies is that they evaluate information on both exposure and outcome at the same point in time, limiting their ability to establish temporality. Studies in Exposed Communities For the endpoints selected for comprehensive evaluation, 15 studies evaluated highly-exposed individuals residing in communities with known PFOA drinking water contamination or in close proximity to a factory utilizing or pr oducing PFOA. A large majority of these studies (14) occurred among communities in the Mid -Ohio Valley near the DuPont Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, WV. This industrial facility used large amounts of PFOA in the manufacturing of 63 a fluoropolymer, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and discharged PFOA to the environment resulting in widespread drinking water contamination. Many of the studies in this population are the result of the settlement of a class -action lawsuit by residents exposed to PFOA -conta minated drinking water which mandated that DuPont fund a health study called the C8 Health Project. Additional epidemiologic studies of associations with PFOA and health endpoints in this population have also been published by other researchers. T he C8 Health Project is a community health study of approximately 70,000 Ohio and West Virginia residents of all ages (infants to very elderly) with at least one year of exposure to drinking water contaminated with PFOA at >50 ng/L to over 3000 ng/L (Frisbee et al, 2009; C8 Science Panel, 2014). The C8 Health Project was conducted by the C8 Science Panel, which consisted of three epidemiologists chosen jointly by the parties involved in the legal settlement. This study is notable because of its large size, the wid e range of exposure levels, and the large number of parameters evaluated. Data collected included serum levels of PFOA and other PFCs, clinical laboratory values , and health histories . The median serum PFOA concentration in this population was 28 ng/ml (ppb), and serum concentrations in the lowest two deciles were within the U.S. general population range at the time (<10 ng/ml). Th e C8 Science Panel was charged with determin ing if \"probable links \" exist between diseases and PFOA exposure in the C8 study population, based on the results of their studies and other information from the scientific literature. Probable links were defined as \".... given the scientific evidence available, it is more likely than not that a connection exists between C8 exposure and a particular human disease among class members... \". Probable links were established with PFOA exposure and six health endpoints (clinically defined high cholesterol, kidney and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, and p regnancy -induced hypertension). For a number of other endpoints, no probable link with PFOA exposure was reported. Associations were also found with additional health endpoints for which no probable link evaluation was conducted because they were not co nsidered to be clinically defined diseases. These endpoints include increased serum levels of liver enzymes, uric acid, C -reactive protein, and others. C8 Science Panel reports and citations for peer-reviewed publications presenting the results of these studies are found at the C8 Science Panel website (C8 Science Panel, undated, b). Occupational Studies There are 1 4 peer -reviewed occupational studies of the endpoints chosen for detailed evaluation, three of which also studied exposed community populations (Wang et al., 2012, Winquist and Steenland, 2014a, and Winquist and Steenland, 2014b). Eight of the 14 occupational studies are cross -sectional. Locations include industrial facilities in the U.S., Italy , Belgium, and China. Occupational studies are often considered useful for evaluating effects of environmental contaminants because exposure levels are generally higher than in general population or in communities exposed through site- specific environmental contamination. Mean or median serum 64 PFOA levels in occupational studies reviewed in this report were generally over 1,000 ng/ml (ppb), several orders of magnitude higher than the median concentrations in the general population or in communities with drinking water exposure. A ssociations of PFOA with some clinical parameters, including cholesterol, liver enzymes, and uric acid, exhibit a steep dose-response curve in the lower exposure range found in the general population, with a much flatter slope (approaching a plateau) at higher exposure such as those found occupationally (discussed in more detail below). For dose-response curves of this type, the associations found in populations with lower exposures may not be observed in workers because even the leas t exposed workers used as the comparison/reference group in occupational studies may have exposure levels that are high enough to fall on the much flatter upper portion of the dose-response curve. O ccupational studies may also have a selection bias from a \"healthy worker effect\" whereby workers usually have lower overall mortality and morbidity than individuals of the same age as a whole, since severely ill and disabled persons are typically not included in the workforce, especially in industrial settings (Shah, 2009). Longer duration of employment may also increase the effects of this bias, since sick people will be more likely to leave or change to safer work. Therefore, data based on duration of employment may not accurately reflect higher prevalence or larger magnitude of effects that are associated with longer exposures to the contaminant being evaluated. A nother issue with occupational studies of PFOA is the small number of exposed female employees which limits the ability of the occupational epidemiology to adequately address specific effects among women. A n additional issue is the possibility of effect modification due to exposure to other chemicals. Exposure to other PFCs, including PFOS at the 3M Decatur plant, may have played a role in the observed associations. Differences in exposures to other chemicals among manufacturing facilities may result in differences in degree of association with various effects. Comprehensively Reviewed Endpoints Serum lipids Associations of serum lipids and PFOA were evaluated in 24 studies, each of which included one or more of the following endpoints: total cholesterol, high density lipid cholesterol (HDL), non- HDL, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL, low-density lipid cholesterol (LDL), very low- densi ty lipid cholesterol (VLDL), ratio of HDL to LDL, and triglycerides. There is also one additional study which only evaluated expression of genes related to cholesterol transport in humans (Fletcher et al., 2013). Study details are provided in the tables fo r individual studies (Appendix 4) and the summary table for serum lipids (Table 6 A).65 In total, 20 studies evaluated serum total cholesterol and two evaluated self -reported clinically defined high cholesterol (Steenland et al., 2015 and Winquist and Steenland, 2014). Among the 20 serum total cholesterol studies, 15 were cross -sectional (Emmett et al., 2006 b; Eriksen et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2013; Frisbee et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2014; Geiger et al., 2014; Gilliland et al., 1996; Nelson et al., 2010; Ol sen et al., 2000; Olsen and Zobel 2007; Sakr et al., 2007a; Starling et al., 2014; Steenland et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; and Zeng et al., 2015) and two studies included cross -sectional and other analyses (Costa et al., 2009; and Olsen et al., 2003). T he cross -sectional studies include seven studies of the general population or individuals with low - level exposures (Eriksen et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014; Geiger et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2010; Starling et al., 2014; and Zeng et al., 2015); four studies of residents of highly exposed communities (Emmett et al., 2006b; Frisbee et al., 2010; Steenland et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012); and five studies of occupationally exposed individuals (Gilliland et al., 1996; Olsen et al., 2000; Ol sen and Zobel 2007; Sakr et al., 2007a; and Wang et al., 2012). Five remaining studies evaluating serum total cholesterol and PFOA include an occupational case - control study (Costa et al., 2009), and four cohort studies including one study of residents of a highly -exposed community (Fitz -Simon et al., 2013) and three studies of occupationally exposed individuals (Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2012; and Sakr et al., 2007b). Six of seven cross -sectional studies of the general population or populations with low -level exposures found evidence of statistically significant positive associations with serum cholesterol and PFOA. These studies of general population level exposures include a study nested in a larger cohort in Denmark of adults, aged 50 to 65 ye ars, with mean serum PFOA concentration of 7.1 ng/ml (Eriksen et al., 2012); a general population study in Canada with a PFOA geometric mean of 2.5 ng/ ml (Fisher et al., 2013); a small study of individuals randomly selected from attendees at a health check -up clinic with a median serum PFOA concentration of 1.4 ng/ ml (Fu et al., 2014); a study of children in the U.S. general population with a serum PFOA mean concentration of 4.3 ng/ ml (Geiger et al., 2014); a study of the general U.S. population aged 12 ye ars older with a median PFOA concentration of 3.8 ng/ ml (Nelson et al., 2010); and a study of subjects recruited from the control group of another study in Taiwan with median PFOA exposures of 1.1 ng/ml in boys and 0.9 ng/ ml in girls (Zeng et al., 2015). A study of pregnant women recruited from a larger cohort in Norway, with a median serum PFOA concentration of 2.3 ng/ ml, did not find a statistically significant positive association with PFOA and serum cholesterol; however, results showed a positive and increasing association of cholesterol with increasing quartiles of PFOA (Starling et al., 2014). Two large cross -sectional studies evaluated individuals residing in communities located in the mid-Ohio Valley with drinking water contaminated with PFOA. One study included 12,476 children aged 1 to 17.9 years with a mean serum PFOA concentration of 69.2 ng/ ml (Frisbee et al., 2010) and the other included 46,294 individuals aged 18 years or older with a median serum 66 PFOA concentration of 27 ng/ ml (Steenland et al., 2009). Both studies found a positive, statistically significant association of serum PFOA and cholesterol. A third smaller (n=371) cross -sectional study from the water district in the mid -Ohio Valley with the highest PFOA levels in its drinking water , with a much higher median serum PFOA concentration, 354 ng/ ml, did not find a statistically significant association (Emmett et al., 2006) b. A fourth study from China, which in addition to a study of 132 residents located near a plant utilizing PFOA with a median PFOA concentration of 284 ng/ ml also included a worker study, did not find an association with serum cholesterol in either group (Wang et al., 2012). Of the five occupational cross -sectional studies , only one U. S. occupational study (n=840) wit h a median serum PFOA concentration of 189 ng/m l found a positive statistically significant association with serum cholesterol ( Sakr et al., 2007a) . The remaining four occupational cross - sectional studies which did not find evidence of an association include two U.S. male only worker studies, one with a mean serum PFOA concentration of 3,300 ng/ ml and a sample size of 115 (Gilliland et al., 1996), and one with a mean serum PFOA concentration of 1,190 ng/ ml with a sample size of 265 (Olsen et al., 2000). The third study took place in both the U.S. and Belgium with a median PFOA concentration of 2210 ng/ ml and a sample size of 506 (Olsen and Zobel 2007) and the fourth cross -sectional study included 55 workers in China with a median PFOA concentration of 1,636 ng/ ml (Wang et al., 2012). Five of the 20 studies had study designs other than cross -sectional. A longitudinal analysis of workers from Belgium and U.S. with a range of PFOA means of 1,220 to 1,900 ng/ ml (Olsen et al., 2003) , and another longitudinal wor ker cohort analysis from the U.S. with a range of PFOA exposure from 1,010 to 1,160 ng/ ml (Sakr et al., 2007b) , both found evidence of an association with PFOA and serum cholesterol. A third occupational cohort study utilizing matched- pair analysis of 98 t o 179 workers (highly exposed of 881 ng/ ml PFOA mean v. lower exposed of 28.9 ng/ ml PFOA mean) did not find a statistically significant association (Olsen et al., 2012). None of these studies found evidence of a statistically significant inverse associati on with serum cholesterol and PFOA. A n Italian male occupational case -control study with PFOA median concentration 4,400 among formerly exposed workers and a median of 5,700 ng/ ml among currently exposed workers, with cross -sectional analysis, found evidence of a positive association (Costa et al., 2009). Among the cohort studies, a longitudinal study of individuals in highly -exposed mid- Ohio Valley communities, with geometric mean PFOA concentrations of 74.8 ng/ ml at baseline and 30.8 ng/ ml at follow -up, found evidence of a positive association (Fitz -Simon et al., 2013). Although 15 of the 20 studies evaluating associations of PFOA and serum cholesterol were cross -sectional, thereby limiting the interpretation of temporality since exposures and outcomes are measured at the same point in time, four studies included longitudinal analyses (Fitz -Simon et al., 2013; Sakr et al., 2007b; Costa et al., 2009; Olsen et al., 2003). Each of these studies had 67 multiple measurement data, and all four found a si gnificant correlation over time between cholesterol and PFOA levels (Fitz -Simon et al., 2013; Steenland et al., 2010b). In summary, t he epidemiologic data provide evidence of consistency, strength and dose-response, including some evidence of temporality , of PFOA and serum cholesterol. S everal of the studies mentioned above showed statistically significant trends for increased serum cholesterol with increasing serum PFOA. A decile analysis of PFOA with total cholesterol among a large study of residents of a highly exposed community showed an increasing effect of PFOA on cholesterol and additionally the odds of clinically defined hypercholesterolemia (240 mg/dL) increased 40 -50% from the lowest to the highest quartile of PFOA (Steenland et al., 2009). A s tatistically significant trend of increasing serum cholesterol with increasing PFOA was also reported in at least five other studies (Frisbee et al., 2010, Fu et al., 2014, Geiger et al., 2014; and Zeng et al., 2015). I n summary, general population level exposure studies (seven), found consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and serum cholesterol. Additionally, three very large studies (two cross -sectional and a cohort study) of highly exposed community populations found evidence of a positive association between PFOA and serum cholesterol. Two longitudinal occupational studies also found a positive association, along with one case-control occupational study. In contrast, results from two much smaller cross-sectional studies of highly exposed community populations (with higher median population exposures than the three larger studies) and a matched -pairs occupational study did not find an association. Although findings from the occupational cross- sectional studies in general (four out o f five) found no evidence of an association, they may be biased toward the null by a healthy worker effect. This is suggested by a similar pattern of inconsistency among these study's findings as compared to the findings from the corresponding database were also noted for other serum lipid endpoints (HDL and LDL - discussed below). In general, studies of the general population, as well as large, mid-exposure range community studies and occupational studies with longitudinal designs, found consistent evidence of an association, while a few smaller, higher exposure range community and occupational studies found no evidence. None of the 20 studies evaluated found evidence of an inverse association. A review by Steenland et al. (2010a) summarized and evaluated the epidemiologic literature on PFOA and cholesterol available at that time. The authors noted that the lower the range of PFOA that was studied, the greater the change in cholesterol per unit change in PFOA. They suggest that, as discussed in Occupational Studies (above), an exposure-response relationship that is steep at low PFOA concentrations and then flattens out ( i.e. approaches a plateau ) at higher serum PFOA concentrations is a possible explanation for the observed differences in effect magnitudes. Therefore, studies of populations with high serum PFOA concentrations may not detect an association of PFOA with serum cholesterol if there is a steep dose-response curve for 68 the association in the lower exposure ranges. For dose -response curve s of this type, associations may not be evident in populations with higher exposures since even the least exposed individuals in the comparison group may have exposures that fall on the much flatter (approaching a plateau) portion of the exposure/response curve. A ssociations of PFOA and high density lipid cholesterol (HDL), non- HDL, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL, low-density lipid cholesterol (LDL), very low-density lipid cholesterol (VLDL), ratio of HDL to LDL, and/or triglycerides were evaluated in 20 studies. All but two of these 20 studies also evaluated serum cholesterol. H DL and PFOA were evaluated in 19 studies. It should be noted that an increase in HDL is considered to be beneficial, as compared to increases in total cholesterol, LDL, and non- HDL, which are considered to be undesirable. None of these studies found an association with increased HDL, while four of the 19 studies found evidence of statistically significant decreased association with HDL (Gilliland et al., 1996; Olsen et al., 2 000; Olsen and Zobel 2007; and Wang et al., 2012). Interestingly, these four studies are all occupational cross- sectional studies which also did not find evidence of an association with PFOA and increased serum cholesterol (described above), whereas the only other additional occupational cross-sectional study found no evidence of an association with HDL but did find a statistically significant positive association between PFOA and cholesterol (Sakr et al., 2007a). These differences in findings suggest that these occupational cross -sectional studies may be biased from a healthy worker effect. There was no evidence of statistically significant associations with HDL in any of the other 15 studies (Costa et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2013; Fitz-Simon et al., 2013; Frisbee et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2014; Geiger et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2012; Sakr et al., 2007a; Sakr et al., 2007b; Starling et al., 2014; Steenland et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012 [ resident study]; and Zeng et al., 2015). No n-HDL was evaluated in four studies: two general population cross- sectional studies (Fisher et al., 2013; and Nelson et al., 2010), a U.S. occupational longitudinal study (Olsen et al., 2012), and a large cross -sectional study of residents in highly exposed communities (Steenland et al., 2009). Three of the studies found statistically significant positive associations with non-HDL and PFOA (Fisher et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2010; and Olsen et al., 2012), while the occup ational longitudinal study had a negative association with non- HDL which was not statistically significant (Olsen et al., 2012). T he ratio of total cholesterol to HDL was evaluated in three studies with inconsistent findings. A general population study in Canada did not find evidence of a statistically significant association (Fisher et al., 2013), U.S. occupational longitudinal study found a statistically significant negative association (Olsen et al., 2012), and a large study of residents from a highly exposed community found a statistically significant positive association (Steenland et al., 2009). 69 Associations of LDL and PFOA were evaluated in 16 studies. Fourteen of the studies are cross - sectional, which includes seven low level exposure populations (Fisher et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014; Geiger et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2010; Starling et al., 2014; and Zeng et al., 2015), three studies of residents from a highly exposed community (Frisbee et al., 2010; Steenland et al., 2009; Wa ng et al., 2012), and five studies of occupationally exposed individuals (Gilliland et al., 1996; Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen and Zobel 2007; Sakr et al.; 2007a ; and Wang et al., 2012). The other two studies of LDL and PFOA include an occupational longitudinal study (Sakr et al., 2007b) and a cohort study of residents from the highly exposed community, mid- Ohio Valley (Fitz -Simon et al., 2013). Among the cross -sectional studies of populations with low level exposure, three found evidence of statistically significant positive associations with LDL (Fu et al., 2014; Geiger et al., 2014; and Zeng et al., 2015) and four found no statistically significant evidence of an association (Fisher et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2013; and Starling et al., 2014). Of the three cross -sectional studies of residents from a highly exposed community; the two large studies in the mid -Ohio Valley, one which included children and the other of adults, found evidence of statistically significant positive association (Frisbee et al., 2010, and Steenland et al., 2009); while the third smaller study of 132 residents in China found no evidence of an association (Wang et al., 2012). Four of the five occupational cross -sectional studies found no association (Gilliland et al., 2996; Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen and Zobel, 2007; and Wang et al., 2012) while only one of the studies found evidence of a statistically significant association with both LDL and VLDL (Sakr et al., 2007a). Additionally, an occupational longitudinal study found a positive, non- statistically significant association with LDL (Sakr et al., 2007b) while a cohort study of residents from a highly exposed community found a statistically significant positive association (Fitz -Simon et al., 2013). Finally, the rati o of HDL to LDL was evaluated in a cross - sectional study which assessed both occupational and highly exposed residential populations and found a negative association with the worker population and no evidence of a statistically significant association with the residential population (Wang et al., 2012). In summary, positive associations with PFOA and LDL were inconsistent among low level exposure populations, and largely unassociated in occupational studies, but there is consistent evidence of an associat ion with PFOA and LDL among larger studies of the highly exposed mid- Ohio Valley communities: two cross -sectional studies one among children and another among adults, and a longitudinal study. Sixteen studies evaluated triglycerides with inconsistent findings. Four of the studies found evidence of positive statistically significant association (Frisbee et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen and Zobel, 2007; and Zeng et al., 2015), one found evi dence of a negative statistically significant association (Lin et al., 2013), and 11 studies found no evidence of a statistically 70 significant association (Costa et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 2013; Fitz -Simon et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014; Geiger et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2011; Olsen et al., 2000; Sakr et al., 2007a; Sakr et al., 2007b; Starling et al., 2014; and Wang et al., 2012). Selection bias may be an issue in Fu et al. (2014) since the study included only individuals attending a health clinic check -up such that individuals concerned with existing health issues may be more likely to be included. Selection bias may also be an issue in Lin et al. (2013), which included individuals with an abnormal urinalysis from a population- based screening program in which the final study population was made up of 246 (37%) individuals with elevated blood pressure. Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in the general population studies which relied on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers. In contrast, some occupational studies relied on medical record abstraction of clinical parameters. Other limitations of occupational studies include small sample size that may limit power to detect associations, possibility of healthy worker effect, inclusion of few or no women, and the possibility that exposure in the least exposed groups may be well above the population exposure range in occupationally exposed individuals. The biological plausibility of the association of PFOA and serum cholesterol was investigated i n a study of associations of serum PFOA and changes in expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. In this cross -sectional study, expression of 13 genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (cholesterol biogenesis, peroxisome proliferation, chol esterol transport, downstream transcriptional activation of PPAR -alpha, and mobilization of cholesterol) was evaluated in whole blood from 290 subjects from a highly exposed community (geometric mean serum PFOA, 32.2 ng/ml). Statistically significant assoc iations between genes involved in cholesterol transport and mobilization and PFOA were found, and the affected genes differed in men and women. The authors state that these change in gene expression \"appear consistent with PFOA promoting a hypercholesterol emic environment\" (Fletcher et al., 2013). Effects of PFOA on serum lipids in laboratory animals are considered in evaluating the biological plausibility of the associations of PFOA and cholesterol found in humans. Serum cholesterol was not affected by P FOA in a 6 -month study of cynomolgus monkeys (Butenhoff et al., 2002), while triglycerides were significantly increased compared to controls at several time points in the monkeys in the mid- and high dose groups (10 and 20/30 mg/kg/day). As discussed above , the dose -response curve for increased cholesterol in humans appears steepest at serum PFOA levels below about 40 ng/ml, with a much flatter dose -response at higher serum levels. In the monkey study, the mean serum PFOA level in the control group was 134 ng/ml. If the dose - response curve is similar in monkeys such that effects on serum cholesterol are steepest at lower serum PFOA levels, effects may not be observable because the control exposure levels could be high enough to fall on the much flatter portion of the dose -response curve. 71 Although PFOA is consistently associated with increased serum cholesterol in humans , serum cholesterol and triglycerides are generally decreased by PFOA in rodents . This effect in rodents is attr ibuted to PPAR -alpha activation (Lau, 2013). As discussed in detail in the Mode of Action section below, PPAR -alpha activators typically reduce serum lipids in both rodents and humans, and this is the basis for the use of fibrates as hypolipidemic drugs in humans. It is well established that the effects of PFOA in rodents differ from those of other PPAR -alpha activators, and that PFOA affects rodents through both PPAR -alpha independent and PPAR -alpha dependent pathways. It is possible that the dissimilar effects o f PFOA on serum lipids in humans and rodents could arise from a different balance of PPAR -alpha dependent and independent processes with o pposite effects on this endpoint. Two recent studies, discussed in detail in the Mode of Action section, suggest the important possibility that the contrasting effects on serum cholesterol observed in humans and animals may result from differences in dietary fat content, rather than intrinsic interspecies biochemical or physiological differences (Tan et al., 2013; Rebhol z et al., 2016). In these studies, mice were fed a diet with a high fat content, similar to that of a typical U.S. diet, instead of standard lower fat laboratory chow. Serum cholesterol was either increased or unaffected in mice fed the high fat diets. In contrast, serum cholesterol was decreased, as is typically seen in mice fed the regular diet in Tan et al. (2013), while Rebholz et al. (2016) did not include a regular diet group. These results suggest that effects of PFOA on cholesterol may be similar in rodents and humans consuming the same dietary fat content , and they provide evidence for biological plausibility for PFOA's effects on serum cholesterol in humans. In summary, the epidemiologic data base for serum cholesterol and PFOA , which included twen ty studies , provides evidence of consistency, strength and dose -response, including some evidence of temporality . Associations with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia were reported in some studies. These findings provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between PFOA and serum cholesterol. Overall , the epidemiologic evidence suggests no evidence of an association with HDL and PFOA. There were a limited number of epidemiologic studies evaluating an association with non- HDL or the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL and PFOA. The epidemiologic database for PFOA and LDL appears inconsistent. Although there is some evidence of an association with LDL, it remains limited due to the interpretation of other studies which found no evidence of an association. There is limited epidemiologic evidence evaluating associations of VLDL, the ratio of HDL to LDL, and triglycerides with PFOA. Liver enzymes/bilirubin A total of 1 6 studies evaluated associations between PFOA and clinical biomarkers used in the diagnosis and/or evaluation of treatment of liver function or metabolic disease. These biomarkers include the following unspecified bilirubin (TB) and direct bilirubin (DB). Additionally, 72 two studies assessed PFOA and liver disease (LD). Stu dy details are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 4) and the summary table for liver enzymes/bilirubin (Table 6B). Two larger cross -sectional general population studies utilizing different survey cycles of the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) both found evidence of statistically significant positive associations with PFOA and the liver enzyme ALT (Gleason et al., 2015 and Lin et al., 2010). Two other cross -sectional studies of a population with low -level exposure cross -sectional studies have also evaluated this association. A study that was based on a population recruited from a larger cohort in Taiwan (n=608) found a positive statistically significant correlation (Yamaguchi et al., 2013), while a small stu dy (n=141) of pregnant women in China did not find a significant correlation between PFOA and ALT (Jiang et al., 2014). Of the three cross -sectional studies of mid -Ohio Valley residents, the smaller study (n=371) with a higher median and narrower range of PFOA exposure found no evidence of an association (Emmett et al., 2006 b), while the two larger studies (n=47,092) with a wider range of exposures found a consistent positive statistically significant association with ALT and PFOA (Gallo et al., 2012; and G allo et al., 2016). Nine additional occupational studies investigated associations of ALT and PFOA with inconsistent findings. Among these studies only one cross -sectional study found evidence of a positive association (Olsen et al., 2007), one found evidence of a negative association (Gilliland et al., 1996) and four cross -sectional studies found no consistent evidence of an association (Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen et al., 2003; Sakr et al., 2007a; and Wang et al., 2012). An occupational case -control study, with cross -sectional components, found some evidence of a positive association (Costa et al., 2009); one longitudinal occupational study found evidence of a negative association (Olsen et al., 2012), and a second longitudinal occupational study found no e vidence of an association (Sakr et al., 2007b). Although results of occupational studies were inconsistent, both cross -sectional general population studies found evidence of an increasing trend (Gleason et al., 2015 and Lin et al., 2010). The much large r studies of a highly -exposed community also found increasing levels of ALT with increasing serum concentrations of PFOA (Darrow et al., 2016; Gallo et al., 2012). Further, the associations noted by Gallo et al. (2012) were consistent both between water di stricts and among individuals within the same district, which also increased the strength of evidence . Additionally, the modeled serum PFOA exposure assessment used by Darrow et al. (2016) complement s evidence from previous studies because these estimates are not affected by reverse causation. Thirteen studies evaluated associations of PFOA and GGT: six studies found evidence of a positive statistically significant association (Costa et al., 2009; G allo et al., 2012; Gleason et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2010; Olsen and Zobel, 2007; and Sakr et al., 2007a) and the remaining seven studies found no statistically significant evidence of an association (Darrow et al., 2016; Emmett et al., 2006b; Gilliland et al., 1996; Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen et al., 2003; Sakr et al., 2007b; and 73 Yamaguchi et al., 2013). Twelve studies also evaluated the association of PFOA and AST; three found evidence of a positive statistically significant negative association (Gleason et al., 2015; Sakr et al., 2007b; Yamaguchi et al., 2013); two studies found some evidence of a negative association (Gilliland et al., 1996 and Wang et al., 2012) and seven other studies found no evidence (Emmett et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2014; Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen and Zobel 2007; Olsen et al., 2012; and Sakr et al., 2007a). Eight studies evaluated the association of PFOA and the liver enzyme ALP. Only one found some limited evidence of a positive statistically significant assoc iation (Costa et al., 2009), while the other seven studies found no evidence of an association (Emmett et al., 2006b; Gleason et al., 2015; Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen and Zobel, 2007; Olsen et al., 2012; and Sakr et al., 2007b). Thirteen studies evaluated the association of PFOA and either total or direct bilirubin. A component of total bilirubin is direct bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism for which increased serum concentrations reflect increases in liver and bile duct disease. Therefore, total bilirubin serves only as an inferential measure of liver function. Among studies of total bilirubin, three studies found evidence of a statistically significant association (Costa et al., 2009; Olsen and Zobel, 2007; and Sakr e t al., 2007b); one study found a positive statistically significant association (Gleason et al., 2015); and seven found no association with total bilirubin (Emmett et al., 2006b; Jiang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2000; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2012; and Sakr et al., 2007a). Two additional studies found no association with direct bilirubin (Gallo et al., 2012; and Darrow et al., 2016), and Olsen et al. (2000) also found no association with total or direct bilirubin. Three studies investigated association with PFOA and clinical liver disease. Melzer et al., 2011 found no statistically significant association of PFOA and current liver disease in a cross - sectional study of the U.S. general population (NHANES). Also Darrow et al. (2016) found no evidence of an association with modeled serum PFOA and medically -validated liver disease when categorized as either any liver disease or restricted to enlarged liver, fatty liver, or cirrhosis among the highly exposed C8 Health Study community. A retrospective cohort of a U.S. occupational population also found no association with self -reported liver disease and estimated serum PFOA concentration (Steenland and Zhao et al., 2015). As previously described, cross -sectional studies limit interpretation of temporality. Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in the general population studies which relied on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers. Small sample sizes in some studies may have limited their power to detect as sociations ( Emmett et al., 2006 b; Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012; and Yamaguchi et al., 2013). In addition to small sample size, some occupational studies relied on abstraction of clinical parameters from medical records . Other limitations of occupa tional 74 studies include the possibility of healthy worker effect, inclusion of few or no women, and the possibility that exposure in the least exposed groups may be well above the population exposure range in occupationally exposed individuals. Toxicologic al and mode of action data support the biological plausibility of hepatic effects of PFOA in humans. As discussed in detail in the Toxicology and Mode of Action sections below, it is well established that hepatic toxicity is a sensitive effect of PFOA in experimental animals. Based on studies in non- human primates, standard strains of rodents, and rodents lacking a functional PPAR -alpha receptor, hepatic effects of PFOA are considered relevant to humans. In summary, the evaluation of epidemiologic studies provides evidence of some inconsistencies among the group of studies evaluated. However, there was consistency among the larger non - occupational studies, as well as evidence of specificity, exposure -response, strength, and biologic plausibility for PFOA and ALT . These findings provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between PFOA and ALT. Th e epidemiologic evidence of an association with PFOA and GGT, AST, and bilirubin is inconsistent, while there was no evidence of an association with PFOA and ALP. There is also limited epidemiologic evidence of a causative relationship with PFOA and liver disease, and the available studies did not find an association. Thyroid hormones, TSH, and thyroid disease Twenty studies were identified as evaluat ing thyroid hormones, TSH, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, thyroid disease in general, and/or other thyroid conditions. Study details are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 4) and the summary table for thyroid effects (Table 6C). Thyroid st imulating hormone (TSH) was the most commonly evaluated thyroid endpoint, and there was limited evidence of a positive statistically significant relationship with PFOA. Three general population studies which include a cross -sectional U.S. population study (Jain, 2013), a South Korean prospective birth cohort (Kim et al., 2011), and a prospective cohort study in Canada (Webster et al., 2014) found some evidence of a positive statistically significant association of elevated TSH and PFOA. The remaining 12 studies found limited or no evidence of a positive association. These 12 studies are all cross -sectional study design, which include six general population studies (Bloom et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014; and Wen et al., 2013), three studies of residents in a highly exposed community (Emmett et al., 2006 b; Knox et al., 2011; Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012), and three occupational studies (Olsen et al., 1998; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen and Zobel 2007). Three of the 12 studies also included components of other study designs in addition to the cross -sectional design: birth cohort (Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012), longitudinal (Olsen et al., 1998), and prospective birth cohort (Wang et al., 2014) 75 Additionally, tota l thyroxine (TT4) has been extensively evaluated with little evidence of a positive statistically significant association. Only two studies found some evidence of statistically significant positive association (de Cock et al., 2014, and Knox et al., 2011), while 11 others found no evidence of a statistically significant association (Jain 2013; Ji et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013; Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012; Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen and Zobel 2007; Shrestha et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014; Webster et al., 2014; and Wen et al., 2013). A case -control study of hypothyroxemic pregnancy matched with non- hypothyroxemic pregnant women in Canada evaluated the association of PFOA and maternal hypothyroxemia, a common condition in pregnant women chara cterized by low maternal free thyroid hormone (fT4) and normal TSH levels, and found no evidence of a statistically significant association (Chan et al., 2011). Eight studies evaluated PFOA and associations with total triiodothyronine (TT3). Four of the se studies found some evidence of a statistically significant positive association, including two larger (n=1,540 and 1,180) cross -sectional studies of the U.S. general population (Jain 2013 and Wen et al., 2013, respectively) a s well as both of the occupational studies (Olsen et al., 2003; Olsen and Zobel 2007).Three studies did not find any statistically significant evidence of an association (Kim et al., 2011; Shrestha et al., 2015; and Wang et al., 2014), while a large (n=50,113) cros s-sectional study of the mid -Ohio Valley which found some evidence of an inverse association (Knox et al., 2011). Two of these studies also evaluated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and neither found evidence of a statistically significant association (Jain, 2013; and Wen et al., 2013). These same two studies also evaluated associations of PFOA and thyroglobulin and found no evidence of a statistically significant association (Jain, 2013 and Wen et al., 2013). Three studies evaluated the association of PFOA and hypo- and hyperthyroidism, with mixed results. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is under -active and is characterized by elevated TSH serum levels combined with low serum FT4. Hyperthyroidism is a condition involving an over -active thyroid gland and is characterized by very low TSH hormone and raised FT4. Lopez -Espinosa et al. (2012) found a borderline statistically significant positive association with measured PFOA concentrations and self -reported subclinical hypothyroidism, but found non- statistically significant results for modeled PFOA, including modeled in utero exposure to PFOA, and subclinical measures of hypothyroidism. Odds ratio for PFOA and hyperthyroidism were mixed and not statistically significant. A study by Wen et al. (2013) of the U.S. adult general population found a statistically significant positive association of hypothyroidism among women but not men, and a statistically significant negative association of hyperthyroidism among men and not women. Winquist and Steenland (2014b) found increasing hazards with increasing PFOA exposure for hypothyroidism, although the trend was not statistically significant, while retrospective and prospective analyses were statistically significantly positively associated among men . A statistically significant trend of hyperthyroidism and increasing PFOA exposure was found overall and for women. 76 Five studies evaluated thyroid disease in general, which may also include hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Three studies found some evidence of a statistically significant positive association with PFOA and thyroid disease. A large study of highly exposed children in the mid-Ohio Valley found a positive statistically significant association among measured PFOA concentrations, median of 29 ng/ ml, and parent -reported thyroid disease, but this association was not statistically significant with modeled PFOA (Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012). A cross -sectional study of the U.S. general population found increasing odds ratio of self -reported thyroid disease , both ever and current, with increasing quartiles of PFOA among women but not men (Melzer et al., 2011). A large retrospective cohort study with prospective analyses found evidence of a positive association with thyroid disease and increasing quintiles of PFOA which was strongest among women for retrospective analyses, but prospective analyses found no clear associations with PFOA and thyroid disease (Winquist and Steenland, 2014b). The remaining two studies, a small study in a highly exposed community wiht median serum PFOA concentration of 354 ng/ml and a relatively narrow range of exposures (Emmett et al., 2006b), and a retrospective occupational cohort with a median PFOA exposure of 113 ng/ ml (Steenland et al., 2015), found no evidence of a statisticall y significant association with thyroid disease and PFOA. As discussed above, the C8 Science Panel concluded there was a probable link with PFOA and thyroid disease. The C8 Science Panel summarized the epidemiologic evidence of an association with PFOA a nd thyroid function or disease and, although the evidence was deemed inconsistent, concluded that \"...the presence of some independent pieces of evidence indicative of an association was not easily dismissed, despite a lack of coherence among them .\" The C8 Science Panel determined the strongest evidence for an association was increased occurrence of medically validated thyroid disease (hyperthyroidism in women, hypothyroidism in men) with increasing measured PFOA exposure (2005- 2006) in the prospective analy ses (2005- 2010). Therefore, d espite inconsistencies in the evidence, the Panel concluded that there was evidence of a probable link between C8 and thyroid disease (C8 Science Panel, 2012) . Selection bias may be an issue in Lin et al. (2013b) which included individuals with an abnormal urinalysis from a population- based screening program. Information bias is unlikely to have had an impact in these studies , as they relied mostly on serum concentrations of exposure and outcomes. Although serum thyroid function measures are collected at a single time point in many studies, these thyroid function measures are maintained over time in the body. Also, reliance on recall for studies assessing thyroid disease, hypo -, and hyperthyroidism may bias results (Lopez - Espinosa et al., 2012). Small sample sizes in some studies may have limited their power to detect associations (Bloom et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011b; Mundt et al., 2007; and Webster et al., 2014). 77 Although thyroid endpoints were not evaluated in most toxicology studies of PFOA, data from a limited number of studies, reviewed in the Toxicology section below, support the biological plausibility of effects of PFOA on human thyroid function. Although no effects on thyroid hormones were seen in a very small 29- day study of cynomolgus monkeys, changes in TSH, T3, and T4 occurred at multiple time points in a 6- month study in this species. Thyroid hormones were significantly decreased in rats in a short dur ation exposure study using a high dose of PFOA. Thyroid endpoints have not been evaluated in longer duration, lower dose, or rodent studies. Overall, studies evaluating thyroid hormones, TSH, and thyroid disease provide inconsistent evidence of any associ ations with PFOA. The C8 Science Panel concluded that, despite the inconsistencies of findings among studies, compelling evidence for associations with thyroid disease could not be dismissed, and a probable link with PFOA and thyroid disease was determined . Uric acid Uric acid is a product of purine metabolism with both oxidant and antioxidant properties, and elevated levels are a marker of kidney disease. Additionally, some studies have shown that elevated uric acid is associated with cardiovascular disease and may trigger hypertension (Klein et al., 1973; Fang et al., 2000; and Freedman et al., 1995). Seven studies evaluated the association of uric acid and serum PFOA concentrations; three of these also assessed clinically defined hyperuricemia. Study d etails are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 4) and the summary table for uric acid (Table 6D ). These studies include six cross -sectional studies and one occupational study which was a case - control study with cross -sectional components. All of these studies found strong, positively statistically significant associations of uric acid and PFOA (Costa et al. 2009; Geiger et al., 2013; Gleason et al., 2015; Sakr et al., 2007a; Shankar et al., 2011; and Steenland et al., 2010) wit h the exception of Lin et al., 2013 which did not find a statistically significant association. Additionally, all three studies which evaluated clinically defined hyperuricemia found strong evidence of a positive statistically significant association (Geig er et al., 2013; Shankar et al., 2011; and Steenland et al., 2010b). Although the six studies with evidence of statistically significant association are mainly cross - sectional, they represent the general population, residents from a highly exposed community, and an occupationally exposed population. These studies therefore evaluated a wide range of serum PFOA concentrations - about 4 ng/ ml in the general population studies (Geiger et al., 2013; Gleason et al., 2015; Shankar et al., 2011), a median of about 28 ng/ ml in a highly exposed community population (Steenland et al., 2010b), and a median serum PFOA concentration range from 428 ng/ ml (Sakr et al., 2007a) to 4,400 - 5,700 ng/ ml (Costa et al., 2009) among 78 occupationally exposure populations. Also, impor tantly, these studies evaluated a wide range of age groups as well, including children less than 19 years of age (Geiger et al., 2013), adolescents and adults greater than 11 years of age (Gleason et al., 2015), and adult populations 20 years or older (Cos ta et al., 2009, Shankar et al., 2011; and Steenland et al., 2010b). The general population studies which evaluated associations of uric acid with increasing serum concentrations of PFOA found strong exposure -response relationships ( Geiger et al., 2013; Gleason et al., 2015; and Shankar et al., 2011). Additionally, Steenland et al. (2010b) found a significant trend and some evidence of increased changes in uric acid with high level of serum PFOA concentrations among residents from a highly exposed communi ty. Lin et al. (2013) did not find evidence of a statistically significant trend in mean uric acid across categories of PFOA exposure but there does appear to be a small, non-significant increase in uric acid level as serum PFOA concentrations increase. Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in the general population studies which relied on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers. Selection bias may have impacted findings in Lin et al. (2013), which included individuals with an abnormal urina lysis from a population- based screening program in which the final study population was made up of 246 (37%) individuals with elevated blood pressure. Reverse causality is a potential explanation for increased uric acid with increasing PFOA. It has been p roposed that PFOA could be higher in individuals with reduced excretion due to reduced kidney function, and that this would also result in increased uric acid (Kataria et al., 2015). Also, Kataria et al., (2015) reviewed toxicology evidence and suggest s that PFOA and other PFCs can adversely impact renal function. Unfortunately, a hypothesis of reverse causality cannot be assessed because the six studies which evaluated uric acid and PFOA are limited by their cross - sectional design in which exposures and outcomes are measured at the same point in time. Epidemiologic evidence provides evidence of consistency among findings, strength of findings with clinically defined outcomes, and exposure -response with PFOA and uric acid. These findings provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between PFOA and uric acid . However, there are limitations in use of the epidemiologic evidence to draw conclusions regarding temporality and there remain some questions of biologic plausibility due to possible reverse causal ity explanation . 79 Antibody concentrations following vaccination Five studies evaluated associations of serum PFOA concentrations and antibody concentrations following six types of vaccines . Study details are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 4) and the summary table for this effect (Table 6E). Only one type of vaccine (tetanus) was evaluated in three of the five studies, each of four vaccine types were evaluated in two s tudies each, and one (mumps) was evaluated in only one study. These five studies include a prospective cohort following 656 singleton births recruited from birth and followed to seven years of age (n=587) in the Faroe Islands (Grandjean et al., 2012). In t his group of children with a median serum PFOA concentration at 5 years of age of 4.1 ng/ ml, researchers found strong statistically significant evidence of a decrease in antibody concentrations following a tetanus or diphtheria vaccination at age 5 and 7 years. Another prospective birth cohort study in Norway collected blood samples at delivery from 99 pregnant women with a subsequent follow -up sample of 56 children at 3 years of age (Granum et al. 2013). The median PFOA maternal serum concentration was 1.1 ng/ ml. Investigators found strong evidence of decreased rubella -induced antibodies with increasing PFOA maternal serum concentrations, but associations with PFOA and responses to tetanus, measles, and influenza vaccines were not statistically significant. A prospective cohort of 12 adults recruited from hospital staff in Denmark with median serum PFOA concentration of 1.7 ng/ ml found no statistically significant association s with antibody response to tetanus or diphtheria vaccines (Kielsen et al., 2015). A larger prospective cohort of 411 adults from the mid- Ohio valley with a high median serum PFOA concentration of 31.5 ng/ml found evidence of decreasing antibody concentrations following Influenza A H3N2 vaccination; however no statistically significant a ssociations were found with responses to vaccines for Influenza Type B or Influenza Type A H1N1 (Looker et al., 2014). The largest of the studies includes a sample size of 1,191 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years of age from the U.S. general population with a geometric mean serum PFOA concentration of 4.1 ng/ ml. This cross - sectional study found some evidence of a statistically significant decrease of rubella- and mumps vaccine induced antibody concentration, but a decreased antibody response to measles vaccine was not statistically significant (Stein et al., 201 6). Associations between decreased antibody concentration and increasing PFOA concentration may be related to a threshold such that limited evidence of associations was found among the two studies with median serum PFOA concentrations below 2 ng/ ml (Granum et al, 2013 and Kielsen et al., 2 015). Both of these studies also had small sample sizes which may have restricted the power of the study to detect a statistically significant decrease. Specificity of the observed association may also be difficult to interpret since responses to many different vaccines were evaluated , with each type of vaccine included only in a few (and often in only one or two) studies . Unlike many of the other outcomes evaluated in studies of the human health effects of PFOA, four of the studies that assess ed associat ions with antibody concentrations following vaccination had a prospective study design, allowing temporality 80 assessment. Since the exposures and outcomes were followed over time, it can be concluded that exposures preceded the outcome. Data from other human studies and toxicology studies provide support for biological plausibility of decreased immune system response to vaccines in humans. As discussed in the Toxicology and Mode of Action sections, PFOA suppressed the immune system in studies of both non- human primates and rodents. Fletcher et al. (2009) reported several statistically significant associations between several markers of immune function (decreased IgA; decreased IgE in femal es only; increased anti -nuclear antibody; decreased C -reactive protein) and serum PFOA levels in communities with drinking water exposure to PFOA in a C8 Science Panel status report (Fletcher et al., 2009 ). As yet, only the information on C -reactive prot ein has been published (Genser et al., 2015). Genser et al. (2015) found consistent and significant associations of serum PFOA with this effect, both within each of the six water districts included in the study and on an aggregated basis. They concluded that these within - and between -district associations strengthen the evidence of causality for this effect. Review of epidemiologic studies provides evidence of consistent findings among studies of decreased antibody concentrations following vaccination a nd PFOA. T here is epidemiologic evidence of temporality . However, there are a limited number of comparisons across the same vaccination types , making consistency/specificity difficult to evaluate. Additionally, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) recent ly completed a draft systematic review of immunotoxicity of PFOA, based on consideration of human and animal studies, along with mechanistic data (NTP, 2016). The draft NTP assessment concluded that PFOA is presumed to be an immune hazard to humans based on (1) a high level of evidence from animal studies and a moderate level of evidence from human studies that PFOA suppresses antibody response , and ( 2) a high level of evidence from animal studies and a low level of evidence from human studies that PFOA increases hypersensitivity -related outcomes. NTP also considered additional, although weaker, evidence primarily from epidemiological studies that PFOA reduced infectious disease resistance and increased autoimmune disease. NTP states that the evide nce for effects on multiple aspects of the immune system supports the overall conclusion that PFOA alters immune function in humans. Endpoints Evaluated by Other Researchers: Fetal growth A collaborative team of scientists developed a methodology for the systematic review of environmental health data titled the \"Navigation Guide.\" The Navigation Guide is intended as a \"systematic and rigorous approach to research synthesis\" that will \"reduce bias and maximize transparency in the evaluation of environmenta l health information\" (Woodruff and Sutton, 2014). The Navigation Guide methodology utilizes a three -step process in which a study 81 question is specified, evidence is selected, and the quality and strength of the evidence is evaluated. Developmental exposur e to PFOA and fetal growth was selected by the research group as a proof -of-concept of the methodology. This effort included evaluation of human epidemiologic data (Johnson et al., 2014), animal toxicology data (Koustas et al., 2014), and a synthesis of both types of data to develop overall conclusions (Lam et al., 2014). The application of the Navigation Guide methodology to human studies required that each identified study was evaluated for risk of bias, and that the quality and strength of the evidence across all studies was rated. The authors reviewed 19 datasets available from 18 studies which met the inclusion criteria. Additionally, a meta -analysis of 10 studies with combinable study attributes was performed. Investigators concluded there was a low risk of bias across the studies. The meta- analyses of birth weight resulted in an overall continuous regression estimate per ng/ml serum PFOA of - 18.9 g (95% CI - 29.8, - 7.9), an estimate of -0.06 cm (95% CI -0.1, - 0.02) in birth length, a - 0.01 (95% CI 0.03, 0.01) reduction in ponderal index (birth weight/length 3 x 100), and a - 0.03 cm (95% CI -0.08, 0.01) reduction in head circumference. The quality of the human evidence was rated as \"moderate\"'. By evaluating the quality of studies, direction of effect estimate, confidence of effect, and other possible compelling attributes, it was concluded that there is \"sufficient\" human evidence, the strongest descriptor for strength of evidence, that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth in humans (Johnson et al., 2014) . The conclusions of another recent meta -analysis of human data (Verner et al., 2015) were generally consistent with Johnson et al. (2014). Verner et al. (2015) estimated a decrease in birth weight per ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood serum of - 14.7 g (95% CI -21.7, - 7.8). They note that their analysis was less formal than the one conducted by Johnson et al. (2014) and that it did not include two studies included in the analysis of Johnson et al. (201 4). The animal evidence was also reviewed by the Navigation Guide research group, and it was concluded that there is \"sufficient\" evidence that exposure to PFOA adversely affects fetal growth in animals (Koustas et al., 2014). The human and non- human evidence was integrated to develop an overall conclusion on whether developmental exposure to PFOA affects fetal growth in humans. The human and non- human mammalian evidence were both rated as being of \"moderate\" quality and \"sufficient\" strength. The authors concl uded that there is \"sufficient\" evidence that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on decreased fetal growth in both human and non- humans (Lam et al., 2014). Although previous research in the C8 Health Study population did not find an association with clinically defined birth weight and PFOA (Stein et al., 2009, C8 Science Panel, 2011), a subsequent study in this population found associations with low birth weight evaluated as a continuous variable (Savitz et al., 2012). Thus, findings from the C8 Health Study do not contradict conclusions reached by the Navigation Guide. 82 Evidence supporting biological plausibility for decreased fetal growth from PFOA is provided by studies (discussed in the Toxicology section) showing tha t PFOA adversely effects prenatal and postnatal growth and development. As discussed in the Mode of Action section, cellular receptors that play a role in the developmental toxicity of PFOA are found in human tissues, and developmental effects observed in laboratory animals are believed to be relevant to humans. Potential impact of glomerular filtration rate on association of PFOA and fetal growth Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the flow rate of fluids being filtered through the kidneys . GRF increases during the first half of pregnancy and declines slightly during the second half (Gibson 1973). Decreased GFR has been associated with lower infant birth weight in some studies (reviewed by Lam et al., 2014; Morken et al., 2014). Because decrease d GFR might also result in higher serum PFOA levels due to slower excretion, it has been hypothesized that lower GFR could be a confounding factor for the association of PFOA and decreased fetal growth. Lam et al. (2014) considered the evidence for rever se causality related to decreased GFR for the association of PFOA with decreased fetal growth. They concluded that the available data did not justify revision of their conclusion of sufficient human evidence for association of PFOA and decreased fetal grow th. Vesterinen et al. (2015) subsequently adapted and applied the Navigation Guide methodology , described above, to assess the evidence of an association between fetal growth and GFR. The authors identified 35 relevant studies (31 human observational, two non-human observational, and two non- human experimental), all of which were rated as either \"low\" quality or \"very low\" quality. All three of these evidence streams were classified as \"inadequate,\" indicating that the association between GFR and fetal grow th was \"not classifiable.\" Based on their review, Vesterinen et al. (2015) concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to support the plausibility of a reverse causality hypothesis for the associations between environmental chemicals during pregna ncy and fetal growth. In an additional recent study not included in the review of Vesterinen et al. (2015), Morken et al. (2014) analyzed data from 953 pregnant Norwegian women (470 with pre -eclampsia and 483 without pre -eclampsia) and estimated GFR in the second trimester based on plasma creatinine. The association of estimated GFR and infant birth weight was not significant at p<0.05 when women with pre - eclampsia, which is associated with decreased kidney function, were excluded from the analysis. When these women with pre -eclampsia were included , the association was significant . Verner et al. (2015) used data from three studies that provide data on maternal G FR and birth weight on an individual basis to modify a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (P BPK) model for PFOA during pregnancy (previously developed by Loccisano et al., 2013) to include the relationship between GFR and birth weight. A Monte Carlo simulation using the modified model was used to estimate the population distribution of PFOA level s in maternal and cord blood plasma during pregnancy and at delivery. Based on an assumed PFOA half -life of 3.8 years, the 83 model simulation predicted a decrease in birth weight per ng/ml PFOA of -7.9 g (CI -9.4, -6.4) based on maternal plasma at term and -7.1 g (95% CI -8.5, -5.8) based on cord plasma at delivery. When a shorter half- life of 2.3 years (which is likely more appropriate, discussed in Toxicokinetics section) was assumed, greater effects on birth weight per ng/ml PFOA were predicted: -9.6 g ( 95% CI on maternal plasma at delivery and -8.1 g (95% CI - 9.4, -6.8) based on cord plasma at delivery. The data from the simulation were compared to the results of a meta -analysis of the effect of maternal or cord plasma PFOA on birth we ight ( -14.7 g per ng/ml, CI -21.7, -7.8) to estimate the effect of GFR on this association. Results of this study suggests that GFR may confound a portion (less than 50%) of the association between PFOA and decreased birth weight, and that it would be desirable to control for GFR in studies of PFOA and birth weight to account for potential confounding by GFR. B ased on review of the relevant information, the Health Effects Subcommittee concludes that confounding by GFR does not account for the major portion of the decrease in fetal growth that is associated with PFOA. Cancer The USEPA Science Advisory Board (USEPA, 2006) described PFOA as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" according to the criteria provided in the USEPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (2005b). This determination was made prior to the publication of the epidemiology studies summarized below and was based on the toxicology and mode of action data available at that time. T he International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO). One of IARC's major activities is the evaluation of the evidence of human carcinogenicity of specific exposures, including environmental contaminants, by international expert working groups which it convenes. IARC considers human, animal, and mechanistic data in making its determinations of evidence for cancer risk to humans . It has classified PFOA as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B) based on \"limited evidence that PFOA c auses testicular and renal cancer, and limited evidence in experimental animals\" (IARC, 2016). The human data considered by IARC (2016) in making this determination included increases in kidney cancer among workers in the DuPont Washington Work plant in Parkersburg, WV (Steenland and Woskie, 2012) and in kidney and testicular cancer among highly exposed members of the C8 Health Project study population (Barry et al., 2013 and Vieira et al., 2013). IARC (2016) also notes that a second occupational study (Raleigh et al., 2014) from another location did not find evidence for increased incidence of kidney cancer. The epidemiological studies cited by IARC (2016) as the basis for its conclusion are presented in more detail below. 84 More recently, the USEPA Offic e of Water (2016a) concluded that PFOA has suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential for PFOA based on the human studies mentioned above that found an association of serum PFOA with kidney and testicular tumors in communities with drinking water exposure and increased incidence of tumors in one more organs in two chronic rat bioassays. It is also noted that an evaluation by Health Council of the Netherlands published in 2013 concludes that the available data are insufficient to evaluate PFOA's carcino genic properties. However, the document states that this group primarily relies on IARC evaluations, when available. The more recent IARC (2016) review, which concluded that PFOA is possibly carcinogenic to humans, was not available when the Health Counc il of the Netherlands (2013) conducted its evaluation. Additionally, the criteria used by the Health Council of the Netherlands to determine carcinogenicity classifications are different from those used by USEPA, NJDEP, and the DWQI. Steenland and Woski e (2012) studied the mortality of 5,791 workers at the DuPont chemical plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia from 1952- 2008. Exposure to PFOA in workers was estimated using a job exposure matrix developed from serum data available for a smaller set of worker s. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated using other DuPont workers in the region and the U .S. population as referent groups. PFOA exposure was categorized into quartiles. The SMR for kidney disease increased with increasing quartiles exp osure (Quartile 1: Quartile 95% Quartile 95% Quartile 4: SMR=2.66, 95% CI 1.15, 5.24 (based on 8 deaths). Mesothelioma and chronic renal disease (malignant and non- malignant) also both had exposure -response relationships with PFOA. When investigators lagged models by 10- years and 20- years, kidney cancer and chronic renal disease remained most elevated in the highest quartile of exposure compared to the lower quartiles. An important potential confounder in this occupational cohort could be tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) which was also used in the manufacture fluoropolymers at the Parkersburg, WV facility and has been ident ified as a rodent kidney carcinogen (NTP, 1997). However, the authors believe that appreciable exposures would have been unlikely, since TFE exposure would have been well controlled due to its explosive and volatile nature. Raleigh et al. (2014) studied the mortality and cancer incidence among 9,027 employees of two 3M facilities in Minnesota. The exposed population came from an ammonium perfluorooctanoate (AFPO), the ammonium salt of PFOA, production company and the non- exposed referent population from a non- AFPO facility. Among the AFPO exposed employees, 4,668 were from a previous study of this population (Gilliland et al., 1993; Lundin et al., 2009) and an additional 675 employees were recruited. Cancer outcomes of interest included cancers 85 of the liv er, pancreas, testes, kidney, prostate and breast. There were too few incidence testicular cancer cases to include in analyses. Incidence cancers were identified through the Minnesota and Wisconsin cancer registries and a vital status assessment was used t o determine vital status and case of death. Occupational exposure to AFPO was characterized from work history records, industrial hygiene monitoring data, information from current and former workers and industrial hygiene professionals, and average annual APFO production levels. Exposure among AFPO workers was classified into quartiles, and employees of the non- AFPO production facility served as the referent population. There were no statistically significant SMRs by exposure quartile for any of the outcome s, with the state of Minnesota serving as the comparison group. The workers had modestly elevated risk of death from prostate cancer (Q4: HR=1.32, bladder cancer (Q3-4: HR=1.96, 95% C I 0.63 to 6.15), and chronic renal disease (Q4: HR=1.37, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.95), but the effects were not statistically significant. There was no evidence of elevated risk for kidney cancer. There was little evidence that APFO increased the risk of prostate cancer (Q4: HR=1.11, (Q4: HR=1.66, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.18) but these also were not statistically significant. There was no evidence of increased risk for kidney c ancer. Investigators noted that unlike the PFOA -exposed occupational cohort in Parkerburg, WV this population was not exposed to the potential confounder TFE, which could account for absence of an association with kidney cancer. Vieira et al. (2013) performed an ecological study in 13 counties which encompass six PFOA - contaminated water districts in Ohio and West Virginia located near the DuPont chemical plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Cases of 18 types of cancer were obtained from the Ohio and West Virginia cancer registries, in which the final data set included 7,869 Ohio cases and 17,328 West Virginia cases. To calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) with logistic regression, controls were selected from the state cancer registries as all other cases of cancers (excluding cases of kidney, pancreatic, testicular, and liver cancers, the types which have been associated with PFOA in animal or human studies). Exposure estimates were based on estimated 1995 median serum PFOA concentrations in the six wat er districts. The analysis was adusted for age, sex, diagnosis year, smoking status, and insurance provider. The first of two analyses, using water district of residence as the exposure of interest and including both Ohio and West Virginia cases, found the odds of testicular cancer was statistically significantly increased (OR=5.1, 95% CI 1.6 - 15.6) and the odds of kidney, non -Hodgkin lymphoma, and prostate cancer were also increased, in the highest exposed water district of Little Hocking, although not sta tistically significant. Kidney cancer was also elevated in the third highest exposed water district of Tuppers Plain (OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.3- 3.1). Lung cancer was statistically significantly associated with PFOA in the total exposed group and in two of the wat er districts. For the second analysis, serum PFOA levels were estimated at a finer geographic scale and restricted to Ohio -only cases. Kidney cancer was elevated in both the very highly exposed category (serum concentration of 110- 665 86 ng/ml; OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.0, 3.9) and the highly exposed (serum concentration of 30.8- 109 ng/ ml; OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.3, 3.2) groups. Barry et al. (2013) evaluated cancer incidence among individuals exposed to PFOA through contaminated drinking water in the mid -Ohio Valle y, as well as subjects who worked at the local chemical plant where PFOA was used (n=32,254). Associations between self -reported cancers and cumulative (based on retrospective yearly estimates for each individual) serum PFOA concentration s were evaluated u sing a proportional hazards model. The model was adjusted for time-varying smoking, time -varying alcohol consumption, sex, education, and 5- year birth year period. Analyses were restricted to the 21 types of reported primary cancers validated through medic al records and state cancer registries (n=2,507, 70% validated). Among the cancer types, only testicular cancer was statistically significantly associated with cumulative serum PFOA concentration (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.00, 1.79), and the effect was stronger w hen restricted to community members only (OR=1.73 95% CI 1.24,2.40). Thyroid cancer was statistically significantly associated with cumulative serum PFOA concentrations among occupational workers (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.00, 3.71) but not among the community study population. Results for cumulative serum PFOA concentrations by quartiles show that estimated risk ratios for kidney cancer (p -value=0.10) and testicular cancer (p -value=0.05) generally increased across quartiles. This pattern was less consistent for th yroid cancer (p -value=0.20), except when restricted to the occupational study population (p- value=0.04). Since this is largely a survivor cohort, differences in cancer survival rates could cause cancer types with shorter than 5 -year survival to be likely to be captured by the study. Additionally, if individuals with cancers caused by high exposure were more likely to die before being captured in the cohort, results could be biased towards the null (less likely to find an association). Therefore, results about these cancer types should be interpreted with caution. A comprehensive review of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant (Post et al., 2012) found evidence that occupational studies showed some consistency of increased cancer mortality and/or incidence for bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer. Post et al. (2012) also reviewed studies showing that white blood cell neoplasms (Leonard, 2003; Leonard et al., 2008), thyroid cancer (Leonard et al., 2008), and carcinoid tumors (Morel -Symons et al., 2 007) were also increased at one industrial facility. A recent review of PFOA's carcinogenic potential focusing on human epidemiological studies (Chang et al., 2014) concludes that the \"existing epidemiological evidence does not support the hypothesis of a causal association between PFOA exposure and cancer in humans. However, further research on this topic is warranted.\" Specificially, Chang et al. (2014) suggest that quantitative exposure assessment at industrial facilities in Asia that continue to prod uce or use PFOA (now phased out in the U.S.) could be used as the basis for future cohort studies with sufficient follow up time. Additionally, continued follow -up of existing cohorts with use of 87 cancer incidence data from cancer registries could provide further information about human cancer risk of PFOA. Information on human breast cancer and PFOA is of interest because toxicological findings provide some evidence suggesting biological plausibility , although the available toxicological data do not support firm conclusions on this topic. Developmental exposures to PFOA cause delayed mammary gland development in mice. Several researchers have stated that, in general, such disruptions of mammary gland development may result in adverse effects later in li fe resulting in increased cancer risk, although no information specific to PFOA is available on this question (Fenton 2006; Rudel and Fenton, 2009; IOM, 2011; Rudel et al., 2011; Fenton et al., 2012). Developmental exposures to PFOA in mice also caused increased numbers of darkly stained foci (described in detail in the Toxicology section) that persisted into adulthood and are considered permanent ( White et al., 2009). Gore et al. (2015) notes that abnormalities of this type can be associated with increased breast cancer risk. However, chronic carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted in mice. Epidemiological studies of associations of PFO A with breast cancer did not evaluate early life exposures. Studies of workers with occupational exposures to PFOA include very few women and are thus not informative about disease incidence in females. The incidence of breast cancer was not increased in a study of many types of cancer in the C8 Health Study population in Ohio and West Virginia communities with drinking water exposure to PFOA that included about 17,000 women (Barry et al., 2013). A small study (31 cases and 98 controls) in the Inuit popula tion in Greenland found significantly increased risk of breast cancer associated with PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonic (Bonefeld- Jorgensen et al., 2011). A subsequent study of this small group of cases and controls found a greatly elevated odds ratio for breast cancer in women with both high PFC levels and specific polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes that affect levels of hormones such as estrogens, suggesting that inter -individual variations in these polymorphisms may affect sensitivity to the effects of PFCs on breast cancer risk (Ghisari et al., 2014). Because this was the only such study and it is of small size, these data are considered preliminary and sugge st the need for further research on this topic. In regard to biological plausibility for human carcinogenicity, PFOA caused hepatic, testicular Leydig cell, and pancreatic acinar cell tumors in two chronic studies in male rats (discussed in Toxicology section). Potential human relevance of these tumors is discussed in the Mode of Action section. Although liver tumors in rodents caused by compounds that activate PPAR -alpha are generally not considered relevant to humans, activation of this receptor may not be the sole mode of action for liver tumors caused by PFOA. Additionally, a PPAR -alpha mode of action may be involved in hepatic effects in the fetus, infants, and children. Therefore, the potential for 88 human relevance of the tumors observed in rodents cannot be dismissed. The mode of action for the testicular and pancreatic tumors has not been established. Additional endpoints In addition to the epidemiologic endpoints reviewed above, there remain a large number of peer-reviewed studies that have evalu ated other endpoints. Associations with PFOA have been found in some of these studies and not in others. Although these endpoints are not evaluated in this document, other organizations and publications may provide a more comprehensive review A dditional endpoints evaluated in studies but not reviewed in this report include biomarkers of kidney function or damage such as blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, renal glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and chronic kidney disease; heart disease and hypertension; cerebrovascular disease including stroke, diabetes, immune function (with the exception of immune response following vaccination which was reviewed above) including asthma and other allergies, autoimmune disease including osteoarthritis, lupus, juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn's disease; osteoporosis and bone mineral density; neurological and neurodegenerative disorders including self-reported memory impairment and Parkinson's disease; cognitive and behavioral developmental milestones; performance testing, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children; reproductive and developmental outcomes (with the exception of lower birth weight and birth size of neonates), including decreased sperm count, longer time to pregnancy, birth defects, miscarriage and stillbirth, and overweight and obesity measured by BMI and waist circumference in offspring. It is noted that the C8 Science Panel concluded that there are \"probable links\" with PFOA exposure in the C8 Health Study population for two adverse health conditions, pregnancy-induced hypertension and ulcerative colitis, that were not reviewed above. H ealth effects that occur later in life from prenatal and early life exposures to environmental contaminants are a current focus of research in toxicology and epidemiology (Barouki et al., 2012; Heindel and Vandenberg, 2015). Exposures of developing tissues to toxic substances during sensitive time periods can result in increased risk or severity of later disease or dysfunction (Heindel and Vandenberg, 2015). Recent studies have found that developmental exposures to PFOA cause toxicological effects that persist into adulthood and/or become evident later in life, including hepatic toxicity , delayed mammary gland dev elopment, and bone morphology and mineral denisty (Macon et al., 2011; White et al., 2009; Filgo et al., 2015; Quist et al., 2015; Koskela et al., 2016). However, the effects of developmental exposures to PFOA on these endpoints have not been evaluated in humans. Summary of conclusions for epidemiologic information Of the endpoints that were evaluated comprehensively by the Health Effects Subcommittee, the evidence for association with PFOA is strongest for serum cholesterol which demonstrates 89 consistency, strength, dose -response and some evidence of temporality. PFOA was associated with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia in a community exposed through drinking water. There was also consistency among the larger non -occupational studies, as well as evidence of specificity, exposure -response and strength for association s between PFOA and both serum cholesterol and the liver enzyme ALT. These findings provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between PFOA and both cholesterol and ALT. There is evidence of consistency, strength, and exposure -response with PFOA and uric acid as well, but interpretation for temporality is limited. In general, the human data for PFOA are notable because of the consistency between results among human epide miologic studies in different populations for some endpoints , the concordance with toxicological findings from experimental animals, the use of serum concentrations as a measure of internal exposure, the potential clinical importance of the endpoints for w hich associations are observed, and the observations of associations within the exposure range of the general population. As mentioned above, t he epidemiologic databases for cholesterol, the liver enzyme ALT, and other endpoints are sufficient to suppor t one or more of the criteria for causality. The sufficiency of the database to support these criteria is particularly evident when compared to the human epidemiologic databases for numerous other environmental contaminants for which quantitative risk assessment is based on animal toxicological studies in the absence of substantial support from human epidemiologic data ( for example, [MTBE] ). some endpoints, studies of populations from varied loc ations including the U.S., Canada, and several European and Asian countries, with study populations including children, young adults, adults, the elderly, and pregnant women, demonstrate a congruence of consistent findings. Although the human epidemiologic database is largely driven by cross -sectional studies, consistency is supported from studies with stronger study designs such as cohort and/or case - control, especially in studies of the general populations and populations exposed to drinking water contaminated with PFOA. A particular strength of epidemiologic studies of PFOA and other PFCs is the availability of serum concentrations, a direct and accurate measure of internal dose in individuals. In contrast, human studies of most other environmental contaminants usually rely on estimates of external exposure. Exposure assessment tends to be susceptible to misclassification that may lead to biased findings. However, information bia s is unlikely to have an impact in most general population studies of PFOA because of their reliance on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers 90 Application of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to epidemiologic data resulted in the co nclusion that there is sufficient evidence that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects fetal growth. The methodology developed and utilized to assess the relationship of PFOA and fetal growth was substantive and robust such that conclusions reach ed through application of the Navigation Guide are reasonable and supportable. Reviews by several authoritative groups concluded that there is evidence of carcinogenic potential in humans for PFOA. The USEPA SAB (2006) described PFOA as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" based on the criteria provided in USEPA (2005b) cancer risk assessment guidance. More recently, IARC (2015) concluded that, based on its evaluation criteria, PFOA is possibly carcinogenic to humans . Finally, the USEPA Office of Water (2016a ) concluded that there is suggestive evidence of human carcinogenicity for PFOA . For some other endpoints, limited evidence of an association with PFOA was found. There is consistent evidence of decreased antibody concentrations following vaccinat ion, with evidence of temporality. However, most of the vaccine types were evaluated in only one or two studies, limiting the ability to determine specificity . The epidemiologic database for PFOA and LDL appears inconsistent, although there is some evidence of an association. Epidemiologic evidence for other serum lipid endpoints is limited. The epidemiologic evidence of a casual association with PFOA and GGT, AST, and bilirubin lacks consistency, and there is a limited evidence of associations with PFOA and liver disease. Evidence of thyroid disease remains limited. There was no evidence of an association with PFOA and the liver enzyme ALP. Overall the epidem iologic evidence suggests no evidence of an association with HDL and PFOA. Overall studies evaluating thyroid hormones and TSH provide limited or no evidence of any associations with PFOA. Although the magnitude of change for the parameters associated wi th PFOA is generally relatively small, they are of public health concern because population- level changes of this magnitude in parameters such as serum cholesterol or liver enzymes will result in a shift in the overall distribution of values such that the numbers of individuals with clinically abnormal values is increased. Additionally, small changes in a clinical biomarker may be an indicator of other effects which were not assessed. For example, birth weight represents a gross measure of development, and relatively small decreases in birth weight may be an indication of changes in other subtler developmental parameters which were not assessed. The steepest dose -response for associations of some health endpoints with PFOA has been observed within the lowe r range of serum PFOA concentrations. Epidemiologic studies of smaller numbers of highly exposed participants may not be inclusive of these low level exposure ranges and thus may not detect associations. Therefore, an important limitation of studies of 91 participants with extremely high serum PFOA concentrations may be that there are an insufficient number of study participants with low(er) level exposures who can serve as a comparison. To illustrate this point, Figure s 9A and 9B show changes in total serum cholesterol across deciles of serum PFOA concentrations in adults (Steenland et al., 2009) and children (Frisbee et al., 2010) from the mid- Ohio Valley. In both children and adults, associations increased steeply at low ranges of serum PFOA concentrations , with a much flatter dose -response at higher levels. In the absence of data from the lower range of serum PFOA concentrations, modeling techniques might not be able to detect statistically significant changes of this effect with increasing serum PFOA concentrations. Figure 9. Adjusted -predicted total cholesterol change with increasing group median deciles. (A). Adults, Steenland et al., 2009 (B). Adolescents, Frisbee et al., 2009 For instance, in Emmett et al. (2006b), almost all participants had highly elevated serum PFOA levels (25 th percentile value was 184 ng/ml), and comparisons were made only within the study population. Most or all of the lowest exposed individuals in this study may have had serum levels that fall on the flatter portion of the dose -response curve for serum cholesterol , limiting the ability to detect an association. Additionally, Olsen and Zobel (2007) provide data on serum cholesterol and other lipids in workers with PFOA exposure which indicate that the median serum PFOA level in the lowest exposed group, 60 ng/ml, lies on the flatter portion of the dose - response curve in Figure 9A and 9B above. In summary, the consistency between results in different populations, the concordance with toxicological findings from experimental animals, the potential clinical importance of the endpoints for which associations are observed, and the observation of associations within the exposure range of the general population justify concerns about exposures to PFOA through drinking water. Although there is evidence t o support causality for some epidemiological 92 endpoints, the epidemiological data have limitations and therefore are not used as the quantitative basis for the Health -based MCL. Instead, the human data are considered as part of the weight of evidence for th e health effects of PFOA and are used to support a public health- protective approach in development of a recommended Health -based MCL based on animal toxicology data. 93 Table 6A.

As discussed in the Introduction, a literature search was performed to identify publications relevant to health effects of PFOA including toxicological studies. The Health Effects Subcommittee's review focused on toxicological endpoints identified as sensitive and potentially relevant for use in risk assessment . The effects selected for detailed review were hepatic toxicity, dev elopmental effects, immune system toxicity, and carcinogenicity. As discussed in the Epidemiology section, effects relevant to these endpoints have been associated with PFOA in humans. Studies related to these endpoints were summarized in summary tables and/or individual study tables, as described in the sections on each endpoint below. Additionally, information is presented on general toxicity in non- human primates, as well as thyroid, neurobehavioral, and male reproductive effects. General issues In reviewing the toxicology data, it should be kept in mind that female rats excrete PFOA much more quickly than males. Therefore, assuming that both genders are equally sensitive based on internal dose, effects are expected from lower administered doses of PFOA in male rats than female rats. Another general issue for some of the animal toxicology studies is that, using sensitive analytical methods , measurable levels of PFOA were detected in the serum of animals in the untreated control groups. This exposure was likely due to a combination of two factors. First, there is likely some level of unavoidable background exposure to PFOA in laboratory animals, just as in the general human population, due to the ubiquitous presence of PFOA at low levels in the environment. Second, in some studies, the controls may have experienced some level of inadvertent exposure to the PFOA used to dose the treated animals. Serum levels of PFOA in control groups from the some of the studies discussed below were: Butenhoff et al. (2004 a) cynomolgus monkey - 134 ng/ml; Loveless et al. (2006) rat and mouse - 100- 400 ng/ml; DeWitt et al. (2008) mouse - 25- 600 ng/ml; Abbott et al. (2007) mouse developmental: adults - 28- 131 ng/ml, pups - 17- 29 ng/ml ; Macon et al. (2011) low dose mouse developmental: pups - 4- 23 ng/ml. Such low level exposure in laboratory control groups from sources such as diet and bedding also occurs for many other chemicals that are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. However, this issue is of particular relevance to PFOA because, unlike most other environmental contaminants, the dose -response curves for several of the associations seen in human epidemiology studies appear to be steepest at serum levels below about 40 ng/ml (discussed in Human Studies , above). Quantitation levels for serum PFOA in animal toxicology studies (e.g. 5 ng/ml, Reiner et al., 2009) are higher than in studies of human populations (e.g. 0.1 ng/ml in NHANES; CDC, 2015), 105 and serum levels in the control groups in some animal studies are within or above the range in which assoc iations are found in the general population. Thus, the shape of the dose -response curve within the lower range of serum levels (at which associations were observed in some epidemiology studies) cannot be determined in these animal studies . Finally, it should be noted that ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO, the ammonium salt of PFOA) was administered in some studies. Because APFO dissociates to PFOA in the body, results of studies of APFO are applicable to the evaluation of PFOA's toxicity. Acute Toxicity Oral LD 50 values of 680 mg/kg (95% CI 399 and 430 mg/kg (95% CI 295- 626 mg/kg) were reported for male and female albino rats, respectively, after a single gavage doses of APFO and observation for 14 days (Griffith and Long 1980). In this study, five rats per sex per dose group were administered 100, 215, 464, 1000, or 2150 mg/kg. One or more deaths occurred in all groups except the 215 mg/kg group, and all animals in the 2150 mg/kg group died on day 1. Ptosis, piloerection, hypoactivity, decreased limb tone, ataxia, and corneal opacity were reported. These signs were intermittent , and there was no apparent dose -response relationship for them. Changes in the lungs (congestion, pitting, red foc i) and the stomach (distension, hyperemic and thickened mucosa) were commonly seen in animals that died during the study, and many survivors had mottled kidney s and stomach changes similar to those in the animals that died. Other oral acute toxicity studies, as well as dermal and inhalation studies, are summarized by Kennedy et al. (2004). Subchronic Studies in Non-Human Primate s 90-day rhesus 1978) Goldenthal (1978) dosed rhesus monkeys (2/sex/group) with 0, 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg /kg/day APFO by gavage for 90 days (13 weeks). All 3 and 10 mg/kg/day animals survived the study. Soft stools, diarrhea, and frothy emesis were seen in the 3 mg/kg/day group, and one monkey in the 10 mg/kg/day group was anorexic during week 4, had a pale a nd swollen face in week 7, and had black stools for several days in week 12. In the 3 and 10 mg/kg- day groups, body weight gains were similar to controls, and no treatment related hematology or clinical chemistry changes were reported. Serum PFOA data are not provided in this study. Mortality occurred in the two higher dose groups. In the 30 mg/kg/day group, 3 of 4 monkeys died during the study, one male during week 7 and the two females during weeks 12 and 13. All 30 mg/kg/day animals showed decreased act ivity, beginning in week 4. One monkey in this group had emesis and ataxia, swollen face, eyes, and vulva, as well as pallor of the face and gums. Beginning in week 6, two monkeys in this group had black stools , and one monkey had slight to moderate dehydr ation and ptosis of the eyelids. All monkeys in the 100 mg/kg/day group died by week 5, with the first death occurring during week 2. These animals showed signs and symptoms that first appeared during week 1 including 106 anorexia, frothy emesis, pale face and gums, swollen face and eyes, decreased activity, prostration and trembling. Weight loss occurred in the two higher dose groups after week 1. No treatment related gross pathological lesions were reported. Histopathological examination revealed effect s on the adrenal gland, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes in the two higher dose groups. Notably, all animals that died during the study had marked diffuse lipid depletion in the adrenal glands. All animals (including the one 30 mg/kg/day survivor) in the two higher dose groups had slight to moderate hypocellularity of the bone marrow and moderate atrophy of lymphoid follicles in the spleen, and one 30 mg/kg/day female and all 100 mg/kg/day animals had moderate atrophy of the lymphoid follicles in the l ymph nodes. Statistically significant changes in absolute or relative organ weights at either 3 or 10 mg/kg/day in either males or females (but not both) were reported for heart, brain, and pituitary. The biological significance of these changes was stated to be unknown. Relative liver weight data are of interest because this endpoint was affected by PFOA in cynomolgus monkeys and rodents (see below). Since each dose group consisted of only two animals, a large change would be needed to reach statistical significance for this effect. Although there were no statistically significant effects on this endpoint, the data presented in Table 7 suggests that PFOA caused increased relative liver weight at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. Table 7. Relative Liver Weight (compared to controls) in 90 Day Rhesus Monkey Study (Goldenthal, 1978) Relative Liver Weight Dose (mg/kg/day) Males (2 per group) Females (2 per group) 0 1 1 3 1.1 1 10 1.1 1 30 1.4 (1.5) (1.9) 100 (1.6) (1.4) (Numbers in parentheses include dead animals) The LOAEL for this study was 3 mg/kg/day based on the toxicity described above in this group, and no NOAEL was identified. Because serum PFOA levels were not measured in this study, it is not possible to compare the internal dose at which effects occurred in the rhesus monkeys with the results from cynomolgus monkeys and rodents (detailed below). 107 4 week cynomolgus monkey study (Thomford, 2001a) In a range finding study, t he toxicity of APFO was studied in male cynomolgus monkeys (young adult to adult) dosed daily by capsule for 4 weeks (Thomford, 2001a). Dose levels were 0 (n=2), 2 mg/kg/day (n=3), and 20 mg/kg/day (n=3). Parameters evaluated in blood (prior to treatment and on Day 30) included serum PFOA ( although data were not reported in Thomford et al., 2001a), hematology, clinical chemistry (also evaluated on Day 2, about 24 hours after first dose), and hormones (estradiol, estrone, es triol, thyroid stimulating hormone, total and free triiodothyronine, and total and free thyroxin). Of the parameters measured in blood, estrone was notably lower in both treated groups All animals survived until the end of the study, no clinical signs of toxicity were observed in the treated groups, and body weight was not affected by treatment. Low or no food consumption occurred in one animal dosed with 20 mg/kg -day. Microscopic evaluation of the adrenals, liver, pancreas, spleen, and testes found minim al mineralization in the adrenals of one animal given 2 mg/kg/day and immature testes in one animal in each of the two dosed groups (2 of 6 dosed animals). The authors stated that these findings were not related to PFOA treatment. There was no evidence of peroxisome proliferation (assessed by palmitoyl CoA oxidase activity ; PCO) in the liver, or increased cell proliferation (assessed by the proliferati ngn cell nuclear antigen ; PCNA) in the liver, testes , and pancreas of treated monkeys. The authors concluded that NOAEL was 20 mg/kg , and no LOAEL was established. 6 month (26 week) cynomolgus monkey study (Thomford, 2001b; Butenhoff et al., 2002) The toxicity of APFO was studied in male cynomolgus monkeys dosed daily by capsule for 6 months (Thomford, 2001b; Butenhoff et al., 2002). This study is described in detail because it has been used as the partial or entire basis for s everal earlier final and draft PFOA risk assessments (USEPA, 2005a ; MDH, 2008; Post et et al., 2009; NC SAB, 2010; ATSDR, 2015), and because it is considered in evaluating the human relevance of hepatic effects of PFOA (See Mode of Action section, below). Concerns related to use of this study as the basis for risk assessment and the reasons why the data do not support Benchmark Dose modeling based upon it (Butenhoff et al., 2004a) are discussed in detail in Appendix 3 of this document. A table summarizing this study, with a focus on hepatic effects , is included in Appendix 5. Data for increased liver weight from this study are included in Table 10. In this study as originally designed, male monkeys, age 3 to 9 years, were to be administered doses of 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day by capsule, 7 days per week for 26 weeks. Six anim als were dosed per group, except for the 3 mg/kg/day group which had four animals. However, as detailed below, the high dose (30 mg/kg/day) was reduced to 20 mg/kg/day due to overt toxicity. Additionally, only three of the four low dose (3 mg/kg/day) and two of the six high dose (30 mg/kg/day) monkeys tolerated the administered dose well enough to complete the study, while all six animals in the mid -dose group (10 mg/kg/day) completed the study. Two animals from the control and 10 mg/kg/day groups were observed for delayed effects for 13 weeks following the 6 months of dosing. 108 One low dose (3 mg/kg/day) monkey was sacrificed on day 137 (week 19) after loss of about 10% of its weight in one week accompanied by low food consumption, few feces, hind- limb paralysis, ataxia, and lack of response to pain. No specific organ pathology or clinical chemistry changes explaining the morbidity were found, and the study authors stated that it was unclear whether or not these effects resulted from exposure to PFOA. It is notable that the liver -to-body weight ratio in this animal, 2.44, was much higher than for other animals in this group and was comparable to the ratios in the high dose group. Also, the liver -to-brain weight ratio in this animal, 1.66, was the highest of any animal in the study. However, the serum and liver PFOA levels in this animal were not higher than for other animals in the same treatment group. These findings suggest that this animal may have been particularly susceptible to the hepatic effects of PFOA. Dosing of the high dose (30 mg/kg/day) group was stopped on day 12 due to toxicity in the first week, including low food consumption, weight loss, and few or no feces. The dosing of this group was restarted at 20 mg/kg/day on day 22, after a 10- day break to allow for recovery from the toxicity in first week. One high dose monkey was sacrificed on day 29 due to decreased body weight, lack of eating, hypoactivity, and coldness to touch. The liver of this animal had lesions including mid- zonal and centrilobular hepatocellular centrilobular hepatocyte basophilia indicative of liver regeneration. Other effects observed in this monkey included necrosis, erosions , and ulcerations of t he esophagus and stomach, and involution of the thymus. This animal had increased serum enzymes indicative of substantial liver and muscle injury, and a marked decrease in serum cholesterol to about 10% of control levels. The study authors state that the liver lesions were likely related to treatment. Dosing of three high dose (30/20 mg/kg/day) monkeys was stopped on days 43, 66, and 81 due to low or no food consumption, dramatic weight loss (18- 23% of body weight ), and few or no feces. These three monkeys were monitored without dosing for the rest of the study, and their body weights increased to above pre -dosing levels by the end of the study. In the study, serum PFOA levels were analyzed every 2 weeks, including in animals for which dosing was stopped. Steady state was reported to have been reached after 4 -6 weeks. The complete set of serum data was reported in a separate publication (Butenhoff et al., 2004a). Means and standard deviations for serum levels in t he control, 3, 10, and 30/20 mg/kg/day groups, excluding animals for which dosing was stopped, were reported as 134+ 113 ng/ml, ng/ml, 99,000+ 49,000 ng/ml, and 155,000+ 103,000 ng/ml. It is evident from the data that there was a wide variation in serum levels within the same treatment group , and that serum levels did not increase proportionally with dose. The ratios between mean serum levels at steady -state in the 3, 10, and 30/20 mg/kg/day groups were approximately 1:1:2 (i.e. serum 109 levels were similar in the 3 and 10 mg/kg/day groups), and the mean serum levels at 3 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day did not differ significantly at the p<0.05 level (Butenhoff et al., 2002). Hepatic PFOA concentrations at sacrifice did not differ between the 3 and 10 mg/kg/day groups (15,000+ 3600 ng/g and 14,000+ 7600 ng/g, respectively) and were very disparate in the two high dose (20/30 mg/kg/day) animals that completed the study (16,000 and 83,000 ng/g). It is notable that the highest liver concentration by far (154,000 ng/g) was found in the high dose animal sacrificed due to treatment- related morbidity at week 5. Average body weight gains during the dosing period in the 0, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day groups were 19, 20, and 20%, while the weight changes in the two 30 mg/kg/day animals that completed the study were -8% and 18%. Serum cholesterol was not affected by PFOA treatment in this study, while triglycerides were significantly increased compared to controls at several time points in the mid - and high dose group. These observations are notable, since decreases in serum cholesterol have been observed in rodent studies with PFOA, consistent with the effects of other PPAR -alpha activators, and since human PFOA exposure has been associated with increases in cholesterol (see Epidemiology section, above). As discussed above, the dose -response curves for increased cholesterol in humans appears steepest at serum PFOA levels below about 40 ng/ml, with a muc h flatter dose -response between about 40 and 350 ng/ ml PFOA in serum (Nelson et al., 2010; Steenland et al., 2009b). Since the mean serum PFOA level in the control monkeys was 134 ng/ml, the shape of the dose response curve for cholesterol at serum levels relevant to effects observed in humans is not known. In the high dose group, including the three monkeys in which treatment was stopped, total neutrophils, total serum protein, and albumin were decreased . In the two monkeys in this group that were dose d until the end of the study, the changes were not significant but were consistent over time. In one of the monkeys whose dosing was stopped, serum liver enzyme levels and elevated serum bile acids were greatly increased three days prior to the stopp ing of the dosing. Additionally, the high dose monkey that was sacrificed in moribund condition on Day 29 had markedly elevated liver enzymes and markedly low cholesterol. Changes in thyroid hormone levels occurred in treated groups; these are described in detail in the section on thyroid effects below. Although estradiol levels in the high dose group appeared to decrease with treatment, the authors did not attribute these findings to treatment. Absolute liver weight and liver -to-body weight ratios were increased in all treated groups (Butenhoff et al., 2002). The increase in absolute liver weight was statistically significant (p<0.01) in all groups, but was only significant for relative liver weight in the high dose group. However, this analysis does not include the animals that were sacrificed in moribund condition during the study. The absolute and relative liver weight of the sacrificed low dose monkey was 110 far higher than the others in its group, and inclusion of data for this animal increases the mean value for these parameters (Table 10). Liver -to-brain weight ratio is considered to be a reliable measure of effect s on liver weight, because brain weight tends to remain stable when body weight changes. This ratio was increased in all treated groups compared to controls, but did not increase with administered dose or serum level (Butenhoff et al., 2004c). In the control, 3, 10, and 30/20 mg/kg/day groups, the liver -to-brain weight ratios were 0.934, 1.34, 1.30, and 1.22, respectively. No gross or microscopic pathological changes were seen in the organs examined from animals that completed the study. However, as mentioned above, multiple pathological changes were found in the high dose monkey sacrificed in moribund condition on Day 29. These included edema and inflammation of the esophagus and stomach (attributed to dosing injury); liver lesions including mid -zonal and centrilobular hepatocellul degeneration and necrosis, diffuse hepatocellular vacuolation, and basophilia in centrilobular areas indicative of liver regeneration; involution of the thymus (noted as a common stress response); and degeneration and necrosis of the heart (noted as likely an agonal change). Two monkeys from the control group and two from the 10 mg/kg/day group were observed for 13 weeks following the 6 -month treatment period. Weight gain during the recovery period was lower in the 10 mg/kg/day animals than in the controls. During the recovery period, the control group monkeys gained 10 and 11% of their body weight, while one treated monkey gained 5% and the other lost 3%. Studies of hepatic biochemical markers in this study are discussed in the Mode of Act ion section, below. The LOAEL in this study is 3 mg/kg/day based on mortality possibly related to treatment (25%) and increased liver weight, and the NOAEL is unknown. Mean serum levels at this dose were reported by Butenhoff et al. (2004a ) as 80,600 + 40,000 ng/ml. It is important to note that 6 months represents less than 2% of the lifespan of about 30 years in this species of monkey . It is not known whether additional or more severe effects would have occurred with continued dosing of the monkeys that tolerated dosing for the full 6 months of the study. Additionally, this study did not include female monkeys and, because exposure was initiated at age 3 to 9 years , effects specific to exposures during development or at younger ages would not be evident . Comparison of the results of this study with chronic rat studies discussed below suggests that cynomolgus monkeys are more sensitive to the overt toxicological effects of PFOA than are rodents. As discussed above, four of the six high dose monkeys ex hibited severe toxicity that necessitated removal from the study. The serum PFOA level in the high dose monkey that was sacrificed on Day 29 with severe multi -organ toxicity was 822,000 ng/ml. The serum levels of the other three high dose monkeys removed f rom the study on days 43, 66, and 81 due to overt toxicity (low or no food consumption, dramatic weight loss of 18- 23%, and few or no feces) 111 were 102,000 ng/ml, 467,000 ng/ml, and 235,000 ng/ml, respectively, at the times when dosing was stopped. These se vere toxic effects occurred after dosing for about 0.3 -0.7% of the monkeys' lifespans. In contrast, survival was unaffected or increased compared to controls, and no overt toxicity was observed, in male rats with lifetime (2 year) exposure to PFOA doses that were estimated to result in serum PFOA levels of almost 2001; USEPA, 2005a ). severe toxicity resulted from relatively short exposures to PFOA in primates at serum levels below those that were well tolerated chronically by rats. Hepatic E ffects in R odents and N on-Human Primates PFOA causes liver toxicity in experimental animals, including rodents and non- human primates (reviewed by Kennedy et al., 2004; Lau, 2012). As discussed in the Epidemiology section, increased liver enzymes are associated with exposure to PFOA in humans. Increased liver weight is a sensitive toxicological endpoint for PFOA that has been observed in many toxicological studies. Although studies of PFOA that report increased liver weight do not always include evaluation of other hepatic endpoints, numerous studies of PFOA have demonstrated that increased liver weight co -occurs wit h and/or progresses to more severe hepatic effects including increased serum liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, fatty liver, and/or hyperplastic nodules. Additionally, recent studies show that cellular damage indicative of liver toxicity persists until adulthood following developmental exposure to PFOA. This section first reviews data indicative of liver damage from toxicological studies of PFOA . This is followed by a presentation of data on increased relative liver weight from PFOA. Numerous toxic ological studies of PFOA have evaluated liver weight, and a separate discussion of each of the se is beyond the scope of this document. Because s tudies of increased liver weight that include relatively low doses of PFOA are most relevant to quantitative risk assessment , they are reviewed in detail and are summarized in Table 10. Chronic exposure to PFOA also caused hepatic adenomas in rats (See Chronic Studies , below). The mode of action for hepatic effects, particularly as related to human relevance, is discussed in detail in the Mode of Action section. Histopathological changes in the liver Hepatocellular hypertrophy is a consistently reported histopathological finding for PFOA that accompanies increased absolute and relative liver weight. A number of studies in both non- human primates and rodents also report other histopathological changes that are indicative of liver injury and/or lipid accumulation in the liver . These effects occurred at doses similar to those causing increased liver weigh t. Notably, prenatal exposure to a very low dose (0.01 mg/kg/day) of PFOA caused liver toxicity that persisted until adulthood at doses below those which caused increased liver weight (Quist et al., 2015). 112 International harmonization of diagnostic crite ria and terminology for histopathologic lesions has recently been developed to provide consistency and to reflect current knowledge of the biochemical and cellular processes involved in changes in the liver and other organs (Mann et al., 2012). The termin ology and current definitions that are recommended by the international harmonization group to describe hepatic damage were applied where appropriate to describe the histopathological findings discussed below. Information from some studies that reported histopathological effects indicative of liver damage is summarized below . It should be noted that this summary does not represent a complete compilation of all studies such effects . The significance of these effects as related to the mode of action of PF OA is discussed in the Mode of Action section. As discussed above, the high dose (30/20 mg/kg/day) male cynomolgus monkey sacrificed in moribund condition on Day 29 of the 90- day study had liver lesions including mid- zonal and centrilobular hepatocellul ar hepatocyte basophilia indicative of liver regeneration (Butenhoff et al., 2002). In a 28-day study of male and female Chr -CD albino rats with dietary exposure to 30- 1000 ppm APFO, degeneration and/or necrosis of hepatocytes and focal bile duct proliferation occurred in all treated groups (Kennedy et al., 2004). The dose from 30 ppm in the diet was estimated as 1.5 mg/kg/day. Similar changes were seen in livers of rats do sed with 3 to 1000 ppm in the diet for 90 days, and were stated to be more frequent in males, and most pronounced at the highest dose (Griffith and Long, 1980). Individual cell and focal necrosis, increased hepatocellular mitotic figures, fatty changes, and bile duct hyperplasia in male CD -1 mice dosed by gavage with linear APFO for 29 days (Loveless et al., 2008). The LOAEL for individual cell and focal necrosis was reported by the authors as 1 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL as 0.3 mg/kg/day. Focal necrosis occur red in one of ten mice at 0.3 mg/kg/day but was stated by the authors to not be related to PFOA treatment. Increased mitotic figures, fatty changes, and bile duct hyperplasia occurred at > 10 mg/kg/day. Multiple histopathological changes were observed in the livers of three strains (wild type, PPAR - alpha null, and humanized PPAR -alpha) of male Sv/129 mice dosed with 1 or 5 mg/kg/day PFOA for 6 weeks (Nakagawa et al., 2011). PFOA caused a dose -dependent i ncrease in macrovesicular steatosis in the PPAR -alpha null mice, while this effect was not seen in the wild type mice. Additionally, microvesicular steatosis occurred at both doses in the and humanized PPAR -alpha mice. was observed only in the PPAR -alpha null mice treated with PFOA. Single cell necrosis occurred in all three strains of PFOA treated mice and appeared to be most severe in the wild type mice. Hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes was seen in the PPAR -alpha null and humanized PPAR -alpha strains treated with PFOA, but not the wild type strain. 113 Adverse histological changes including deranged liver architecture, severe edema, vacuolar degeneration, focal necrosis, and obvious inflammatory infiltration wer e observed in livers of male Kunming (KM) mice dosed by gavage with 2.5 to 10 mg/kg/day PFOA for 14 days (Yang et al. , 2014). These changes were more severe with increasing dose and were not seen in the control mice. Bile duct injury , which was much more severe in PPAR -alpha null mice than in wild type mice (male 129S4 strain ), occurred after 4 weeks of gavage dosing with 4.4, 10.8, or 21.6 mg/kg/day APFO (Minata et al., 2010). Microvesicular steatosis was also more prominent in treated PPAR - alpha null t han similarly treated wild type mice, and focal necrosis occurred at the highest dose in the null mice. Focal and multi -focal hepatic necrosis was observed at sacrifice on PND 109 -120 in F1 male offspring in the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day dose groups (but not at 1 mg/kg/day) in a two- generation rat reproductive developmental study that is discussed in detail below (Butenhoff et al., 2004b). Histopathological changes occurred in the livers of male Sprague -Dawley rats sacrificed one day after the end of dietary exposure to 300 ppm APFO for 1, 7, or 28 days (Elcombe et al., 2010). This study was conducted twice, and the daily doses were estimated as 19 mg/kg/day and 23 mg/kg/day in the two studies. In both studies, PFOA caused periportal glycogen depletion after 1, 7, and 28 days of exposure to PFOA, hepatocellular hypertrophy after 7 and 28 days, and hepatocellular hyperplasia in all treated rats after 28 days. In a chronic rat study discussed in detail below (Sibinski, 1987; Butenhoff et al., 2012), focal hepatocellular necrosis occurred in 6/15 high dose (14.2 mg/kg/day) males but not in any of the 15 controls at the one -year sacrifice. (The low dose group was not evaluated at one year). At the two-year sacrifice, the incidence of focal hepatocellular necrosis was similar in control and treated groups, but the incidence of hepatic hyperplastic nodules was increased in the high dose males compared to the control and low dose groups . Butenhoff et al. (2012) conclude d that the increased inci dence of focal necrosis and vacuolation at one year, but not at later time points , may have been due to the higher background incidence of these changes in older rats . Additionally, PFOA caused hepatocellular adenomas in chronically exposed male rats in one of the two chronic rat studies that have been conducted (Biegel et al. 2001). Although these tumors were not increased in the other chronic rat study ( Sibinski et al. , 1987), t he EPA Science Advisory Board (2006) concluded that the increased in hepatic hyperplastic nodules in Sibinski et al. (1987) may have been part of the continuum of proliferative lesions in the hepatic carcinogenic process . More recently , Butenhoff et al. (2012) suggest ed that the observations at one year and t wo years in Sibinski et al. (1987) suggest a progression of lesions \"from hepatocellular hypertrophy to fatty degeneration to necrosis followed by regenerative 114 hyperplasia.\" Butenhoff et al. (2012) also note that the diagnostic criteria for these nodules, which indicate a regenerative process, have changed since the study was evaluated in 1986. PFOA caused hepatic triglyceride accumulation (fatty liver) in male Wistar rats after 7 days of dietary exposure (Kawashima et al., 1995). Hepatic triglyceride levels were significantly increased at the lowest dose (25 ppm) and were 3.5 times control levels in the 100 ppm dose group. Several studies have evaluated hepatic effects of PFOA in mice that were fed diets containing specific types of lipids or higher general fat content. Kudo and Kawashima (1997) studied the effect of PFOA (2.5 - 10 mg/kg/day by intraperitoneal injection for 7 days) on hepatic triglyceride accumulation in male mice that had been fed diets containing soy bean oil, perilla oil, or fish oil for 4 weeks. Fish oil, but not the other two types of oil, was known to generally decrease hepatic triglycerides. PFOA caused a dose- dependent increase in hepatic triglycerides in mice exposed to perilla oil and soybean oil, but had no effect in mice exposed to fish oil. Additionally, necrotic cell death, lipid droplet accumulation, and inflammatory cell infiltration were found in male C57BL/6N mice dosed with 5 mg/kg/day PFOA in a liquid diet for 3 weeks (Tan et al., 2013). These effects of PFOA w ere more severe in mice receiving a high fat diet than a regular diet. PFOA caused increased hepatic t riglyceride levels in mice receiving regular diets or high fat diets, and relative white adipose tissue weight was decreased by PFOA treatment. Finally, PFOA (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day by gavage for 14 days) caused lipid accumulation in the livers of male Balb/C mice fed either a regular diet or a high fat diet (Wang et al., 2013). Consistent with Tan et al. (2013), PFOA caused decreased relative weight of adipose tissue in mice receiving either diet . The authors concluded that lipids were both being released from the adipose tissue and accumulating in the liver. Evaluation of hepatic ultrastructural changes showed that PFOA caused a dose -dependent incr ease in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the nucleus of hepatic cells; the dose- response for this effect was similar in the regular and high fat diet groups. In the regular diet mice dosed with 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, dilation of the endoplasmic reticul ar was observed. More severe changes were seen in high fat diet mice at these doses including mitochondrial swelling, irregular nuclei, and condensed chromatin suggesting apoptosis. Two recent studies found persistent hepatic damage in female mouse off spring after maternal gestational expos ure to low doses of PFOA. Quist et al. (2015) evaluated hepatic effects in female CD -1 mouse offspring from dams dosed with 0.01 to 1 mg/kg/day PFOA on GD 1- 17. Livers from offspring were evaluated on PND 21 (weanin g) and PND 91. On PND 21, relative liver weight was significantly increased at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day, with no effect at 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg/day, and PFOA treatment did not cause hepatocellular hypertrophy at any dose at this time point. In contrast, hepatocell ular hypertrophy was significantly increased (p<0.01) at PND 91 in all dosed groups (0.01 mg/kg/day; NOAEL not identified), although the increased relative 1 15 liver weight observed at higher doses on PND 21 had been resolved. Additionally, dose- related hepat ic periportal inflammation occurred in treated offspring on PND 21 and 91, and was more severe on PND 21 than on PND 91. On PND 21, the severity score for this effect was significantly (p<0.05) increased at all doses (> 0.01 mg/kg/day) in a dose- related fashion, with no NOAEL identified. In this study , periportal inflammation was a more sensitive indicator of toxicity from prenatal exposure to PFOA than increased liver weight in female CD- 1 mice. Q uist et al. (2015) also evaluated ultrastructural hepati c changes in control and high est dose (1 mg/kg/day) mice using transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial proliferation and abnormal mitochondrial morphology occurred in PFOA-treated mice at both PND 21 and PND 91 and was more severe at the later tim e point. Peroxisomes were present only in a single liver section from one treated animal and were closely associated with areas of mitochondrial proliferation in this section. In summary, hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed by Quist et al. (2015) at low doses ( > 0.01) on PND 91, a time point when PFOA had almost completely been eliminated from the body and the transient increased relative liver weight observed at the higher PFOA doses on PND 21 had resolved. Although hepatocellular hypertrophy from PFOA in adult rodents has typically been associated with proliferation of peroxisomes or smooth endoplasmic reticulum, these changes were not seen in adult (PND 91) female mice after prenatal exposure to PFOA (1 mg/kg/day). Instead, hepatocellular hypertrophy was associated with mitochondrial proliferation and abnormal mitochondria. The significance of these observations is further discussed in the Mode of Action section. F ilgo et al. ( 2015) evaluated histopathological effects in the liver at age 18 months in female offspring of dams dosed during gestation. The study evaluated three strains of mice: CD -1, 129/Sv wild type, and 129/S CD -1 dams were dosed with PFOA at 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day, and 129/Sv wild type and PPAR-alpha null dams were dosed with 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day. Findings related to non-neoplastic hepatic changes in CD -1 mice included significant dose- related trends for increased incidence of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy, Ito cell hypertrophy, and oval cell hyperplasia, and for increased severity of chronic active inflammation. In the 129/Sv strains, non-neoplastic hepati c changes caused by PFOA were primarily observed in the PPAR -alpha null mice. These included increased incidence of hyaline droplet centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy. In type 129/Sv mice, only severity of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy was increased by PFOA treatment. T he incidence of liver tumors was also evaluated by Filgo et al. ( 2015) because of the unexpected finding of hepatic tumors in some animals that died before the scheduled end of the study. However, the authors emphasize that the study was not designed or intended to be a carcinogenicity bioassay. In CD -1 mice, single or multiple hepatocellular adenomas were found in one or more animals in each of the treated groups (n=21 to 37 per group) except for at the 116 lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg/day), but were not found in controls (n=29). In total, adenomas occurred in 4.9% (7 of 144) treated CD -1 mice , compared to a historic control incidence of 0.4% in untreated female CD - mice. Hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in two treated CD-1 mice (0.3 and 5 mg/kg/day) but not in controls. In 129/Sv wild type mice, hepatocellular adenomas did not occur in control or treated groups (n=6 to 10 per group). In PPAR -alpha null mice of this strain, in contrast, there were no adenomas in the controls (n=6), one adenoma in the 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg/day groups (n=9 or 10), and two adenomas at 3 mg/kg/day (n=9). These tumors occurred in 13.2% of all treated PPAR -alpha null mice. The significance of these findings is further discussed in the Mode of Action section below. Serum liver enzymes and bile acids Most toxicology studies of PFOA 's effects on liver weight and histopathology did not assess serum levels of hep atic enzymes or bile acids. However, several studies in rodents have reported that these parameters were increased by PFOA, and these data are summarized below. As above, this summary does not represent a complete compilation of all data on these endpoint s. Th ese endpoint s are of interest because they are indicative of hepatic damage, and because increased serum liver enzymes are associated with PFOA in human studies of the general population, communities with drinking water exposure, and workers (see Epid emiology section, above). In the 90 day cynomolgus monkey study, ALT and AST were greatly elevated (about 10 to 50 times control levels) in two of the high dose animals that experienced toxicity from PFOA prior to the end of the scheduled dosing period (Butenhoff et al., 2002). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were increased in all dose groups (> 0.49 mg/kg/day ) in a study of mice dosed with PFOA in drinking water for 21 days (Table 8). These increases were statistically significant (p<0.05) at > 2.64 mg/kg/day for AST and >17.62 mg/kg/day for ALT (Son et al., 2008). Table 8. Liver enzymes (relative to control) in serum of mice exposed to PFOA in drinking water for 21 days (Son et al. , 2008) Dose (mg/kg/day) ALT AST 0 1 1 0.05. Numerical data for liver enzymes (mean + SD) are presented in Son et al. (2008). 117 PFOA caused dose -related increases in serum levels of four liver enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic dehydrogenase [LDH] ), as well as total bile acids, in male mice (Yang et al., 2014). The LOAEL for increased ALT was 2.5 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose in the study) , while the LOAEL for increases in the other liver enzymes and total bile acids was 5 mg/kg/day. All parameters were increased to several -fold above control levels at 5 and/or 10 mg/kg/day. Dose -related increases in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and total bile acids occurred i n both wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice treated with PFOA (Minata et al., 2010). For all of these parameters, the maximum increase at the highest dose was much greater in the PPAR -alpha null mice than in the wild type mice. Nakagawa et al. (2011) al so reported small but statistically significant increases in ALT in all three strains of mice (wild type, PPAR -alpha knockout, humanized PPAR -alpha) studied. The greatest increase was 2.3 -fold in wild type mice given 5 mg/kg/day PFOA, with smaller increases in the PPAR -alpha null and humanized PPAR -alpha strains. Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, and LDH) were significantly elevated on GD 18 in pregnant ICR mice dosed with 10 mg/kg/day PFOA on GD 1- 17. AST and ALT were elevated at 5 mg/kg/day, but this effect was not significant, while no changes were observed at 1 mg/kg/day . (Yahia et al., 2010). In a chronic rat study discussed below, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase were increased in males in both low (1.3 mg/kg/day) and high dose (14.2 mg/kg/day) groups between 2 and 18 months of dosing , and in the high dose group a fter 24 months of dosing (Sibinski, 1987; Butenhoff et al., 2012). Butenhoff et al. (2012) conclude that these increases may result from the hepatic hypertrophy and/or \"borderline chronic liver toxicity\" caused by PFOA. Detailed review of selected data for increased relative liver weight Numerous studies have consistently reported that PFOA causes increased absolute and relative liver weight in laboratory animals. Increased relative liver weight is a sensitive endpoint for PFOA that co -occurs and/or can progress to more severe manifestations of hepatic toxicity. Data on increased relative liver weight from rodent studies that used relatively low doses (1 mg/kg/day or less), as well as the 90 day cynomolgus monkey study (Butenhoff et al., 2002), are summarized in Table 10. This group of studies includes five studies that provide data on serum PFOA levels at the end of the dosing period period (Butenhoff et al., 2002; Lau et al., 2006; Love less et al., 2006; Perkins et al., 2004; Macon et al., 2011) and six additional studies that do not include such serum data. Studies providing serum PFOA data at the end of the dosing period are most appropriate for dose -response evaluation in risk assessment, because serum levels are highest at this time point and thus represent the maximum internal doses that could have caused the observed effect. Detailed individual study tables are found in Appendix 5 for the five studies that provide relevant serum PFOA levels. 118 Rodent data on increased relative liver weight Three studies (Perkins et al., 2004; Loveless et al., 2006; Loveless et al., 2008) evaluated effects in male rats exposed to APFO. Perkins et al. (2004) and Loveless et al. (2006) provide serum PFOA data useful for dose -response modeling , while Loveless et al. (2008) does not include serum PFOA levels . Individual study tables for the two rat studies that include serum data (Perkins et al. , 2004 and Loveless et al. , 2006) are found in Appendix 5. APFO formulations containing differing isomer ic compositions (linear/branched, linear, or branched) were used in the three male rat studies (Perkins et al., 2004; Loveless et al., 2006; Loveless et al., 2008) . Both linear/branched and linear PFOA were produced industrially, while information on effects of the branched form , which was not produced industrially, contributes to the understanding of the toxicology and mode of action of PFOA. Perkins et al. (2004) evaluated effects of linear/branched PFOA for 4, 7, and 13 weeks , while Loveless et al. (2006) studied the effects of 2 weeks of exposure to the linear isomer , branched isomer s, or a mixture of linear/branched isomers . Both of these studies evaluated absolute and relative liver weight, hepatic palmitoyl CoA oxidase activity (PCO; a marker of peroxisome proliferation), and serum PFOA levels at sacrifice. The third male rat study, Loveless et al. (2008) evaluated the linear isomer of PFOA and reported r elative liver weight data after exposure for 29 days, but did not report serum PFOA levels or PCO activity . (Both Loveless et al ., 2006, and Loveless et al. , 2008, also evaluated male mice, discussed below.) In Perkins et al. (2004), serum PFOA levels i n rats reached steady state by 4 weeks . The dose - response curves for increased liver weight relative to body weight were almost identical at all three time points (4, 7, and 13 weeks), indicating that relative liver weight did not continue to increase over time with exposures longer than 4 weeks . In the study evaluating the three PFOA formulations with differing isomer content (Loveless et al., 2006) , serum PFOA levels from branched PFOA were lower than from the same doses of linear/branched or linear PFO A. This difference is likely to result from the more rapid excretion of the branched isomers (Benskin et al., 2009; DeSilva et al., 2009). The serum level LOAEL s for male rats after 2 weeks of exposure to linear/branched PFOA reported by Loveless et al. (2006) are consistent with those from the longer exposure periods in Perkins et al (2004). The serum level dose response curves for increased relative liver weight from linear/branched PFOA in these two male rat studies with differing exposure durations are also consistent at the lower serum PFOA levels (less than 75 ,000 ng/ml) and are generally similar at the higher serum PFOA levels. Additionally, the dose -response curves for male rats based on administered dose s of linear PFOA in the 2 -week study (Love less et al., 2006) and the 29- day study (Loveless et al., 2008) are generally consistent; serum PFOA data are not provided in the 29 -day study. Effects in male mice from exposure for 2 weeks to the three isomeric formulations of PFOA were also studied by Loveless et al. (2006). The same parameters that were evaluated in rats were studied in the mice, including absolute and relative liver weight, hepatic PCO activity , and 1 19 serum PFOA levels at sacrifice. The dose- response curves for male mice based on administered doses of linear PFOA in the the 2- week study (Loveless et al., 2006) and the 29- day study (Loveless et al., 2008) were generally similar. However, as above, serum PFOA data are not provided in the 29-day study. T he LOAEL for increased in liver weight in male mice was 0.3 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose in the study) for the linear form and the branched form. The serum levels at this dose were 13,000 ng/ml for the li near form and 14,000 ng/ml for the branched form. These are the lowest serum level LOAELs that were identified for increased relative liver weight. The r elative liver weight at this dose was 1.17 for the linear form and 1.19 for the branched form , compar ed to the controls. For linear/branched PFOA, the serum level at 0.3 mg/kg/day was 10,000 ng/ml, and relative liver weight was 1.19 compared to the controls (similar to the increase at 0.3 mg/kg/day for the other isomeric forms). However, this change wa s not reported to be statistically significant, and the authors reported 0.3 mg/kg/day as the NOAEL and 1 mg/kg/day as the LOAEL for the linear/branched mixture. PFOA increased hepatic peroxisome proliferation (as indicated by PCO activity) in rats in Perkins et al. (2004) and in rats and mice in Loveless et al. (2006). Evaluation of these PCO data reveals that, in the standard strains of rodents used in these experiments, increased liver weight did not correlate well with this biochemical marker of he patic peroxisome proliferation, particularly in mice. Additionally (as mentioned above) , PFOA caused increased hepatic peroxisome proliferation ( as indicated by PCO activity ) in primates as well as rodents. These PCO data are informative in evaluating the role of PPAR -alpha activation in the increased liver weight caused by PFOA and are discussed in detail in the Mode of Action section below. I n another study that includes serum PFOA data from the end of the dosing period, pregnant mice were dosed on GD 1 -17 with 1 , 3, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day PFOA (Lau et al, 2006; Table 10; Appendix 5A). sacrifice o n GD 18, the serum level LOAEL for increased liver weight was 22,000 ng/ml (from an administered dose of 1 mg/kg/day) and a NOAEL was not identified (Lau et al., 2006). (Numerical data are not shown in publication and were provided by the investigator.) A second study of pregnant mice evaluated liver weight and serum PFOA levels on PND 21 in wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice dosed throughout gestation (Abbott et al., 2007). The NOAELs and LOAELs for increased liver weight based on serum PFOA from this study are not comparable to those from the other studies because serum PFOA was evaluated 3 weeks after dosing ended. T wo additional studies in male (Son et al., 2008) or female (DeWitt et al., 2008) adult mice exposed to PFOA in drinking water for 15 or 21 days that did not report serum PFOA data are also included in Table 10. As shown in the table, LOAELs based on administered dose from 120 these studies are generally consistent with the other mouse studies discussed above. NOAELs were not identified in these studies . Three studies included in Table 10 evaluated increased liver weight in mouse pups after developmental exposures to PFOA . One of these studies (Macon et al., 2011) evaluated liver weight in offspring on PND 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21 after maternal exposure on GD 10- 17 (late gestation) . This study provides serum PFOA data from PND 1, one day after gestational exposure ended. As shown i n the detailed table for this study in Appendix 5B and in Table 12, delayed mammary gland development (LOAEL - 0.01 mg/kg/day) was a much more sensitive endpoint than increased liver weight (LOAEL - 1 mg/kg/day) in this study. In an additional component of this study with full gestational exposure (GD 1 -17) to PFOA, serum PFOA levels were not measured. The LOAEL for increased liv er weight on PND 7 was lower with the longer exposure period (GD 1 -17) than for the late gestational (GD 10- 17) exposure discussed above, consistent with the greater total dose from longer exposure. Another study (Tucker et al., 2015) assessed relative l iver weight on PND 21 and later time points in CD -1 and C57/Bl mouse pups after maternal exposure to 0.01 - 1 mg/kg/day PFOA on GD 1 -17. As in Macon et al. ( 2011), delayed mammary gland development was a more sensitive endpoint than increased liver weight in this study. Finally, Abbott et al. (2007) evaluated relative liver weight in wild type and PPAR -alpha null offspring, as well as maternal relative liver weight (above), on PND 21. In this study, the LOAEL for increased relative liver weight in wild type pups (0.1 mg/kg/day) was 10 -fold lower than the maternal LOAEL (1 mg/kg/day) , while the LOAEL for this effect in PPAR -alpha null mice was the same in pups and dams (3 mg/kg/day) . Cynomolgus monkey data on increased relative liver weight Liver weight (absolute and relative to body weight) was increased in all treated groups in the 90- day study of cynomolgus monkeys (Appendix 5; Butenhoff et al., 2002). The increase in absolute liver weight was statistically significant (p<0.01) in all groups, but rel ative liver weight was significantly increased only in the high dose group. However, this analysis did not include the animals sacrificed during the study due to overt toxicity . The absolute and relative liver weight in the sacrificed low dose monkey was far higher than the others in its group, and inclusion of data for this animal increases the mean value for these parameters in the low dose group. Liver -to-brain weight ratio is considered to be a reliable measu re of ef fects on liver weight, because brain weight tends to remain stable when body weight changes. This ratio was increased in all treated groups compared to controls, with statistical significance at the two lower dose levels, but there was no dose -response bas ed on either administered dose or serum level . As discussed above, serum PFOA levels did not differ significantly between the low and mid dose groups (Butenhoff et al., 2004c). 1 21 The data from Butenhoff et al. (2002) are not informative as to the dose- response curve or the NOAEL for PFOA's effects on increased liver weight in this species of monkey, because this effect did not increase with either administered or internal dose. Additionally, mortality of one of four animals at the lowest dose was possibly treatment -related, and four of the six high dose monkeys did not complete the study because of overt toxicity or mortality. Comparison of the relative liver weight and serum PFOA level data from the 90 day cynomolgus monkey study and the rat studies (Perkins et al., 2004; Loveless et al., 2006) reveals similar increases in liver weight at comparable serum levels in both species. Additionally, comparable increases in PCO activity occurred at similar serum PFOA levels in monkeys and rats (discussed further in Mode of Action section ). These data suggest that cynomolgus monkeys and rats have similar sensitivity to the hepatic effects of PFOA. Immune system effects in rodents and non- human primates PFOA causes suppression of the immune response in experimental animals. As discussed in the Epidemiology section, decreased response to vaccinations has been associated with PFOA in humans. Toxicological studies that evaluated effects of oral exposure to PFOA on the immune system in rodents are summarized in Table 13. Sixteen publications of such studies were identified. Of these, 14 publications report only studies of mice, one publication reports only studies in rats, and one publication includes studies in both species. Both of the rat studies, and 11 of the 15 mouse studies, were conducted in males, while two of the mouse studies evaluated adult females , and two of the mouse studies evaluated effects of developmental exposures on offspring. Additionally, effects on the immune system were reported in the 90-day oral study of rhesus monkeys (Goldenthal, 1978). Studies of effects on the immune system from dermal exposure to PFOA are not reviewed in this document. Toxicological effects on the immune system are of particular interest because PFOA and other PFCs have been associated with decreased vaccine response in humans (see Epidemiology section). Non-human primates In the 90-day rhesus monkey study (Goldenthal, 1978), histopathological changes related to the immune system occurred in all animals in the two higher dose groups (30 and 100 mg/kg/day). All animals in these two dose groups had slight to moderate hypocellularity of the bone marrow and moderate atrophy of lymphoid follicles in the spleen, and one 30 mg/kg/day female and all 100 mg/kg/day animals had moderate atrophy of the lymphoid follicles in the lymph nodes. These changes were not seen in the lower dose groups (3 and 10 mg/kg/day). Because serum PFOA levels are not provided in this study, it cannot be used for dose-response in risk assessment. Rodents PFOA consistently suppresse d the immune system in studies of mice (Table 13). Effects in mice include decreased absolute and relative spleen and thymus weights, decreased thymocyte and splenocyte counts, decreased immunoglobulin response, and changes in total numbers and/or 122 specific populations of lymphocytes in the spleen, thymus, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. The available data indicates that rats are less sensitive than mice to immunotoxic effects of PFOA, since immune system effects were not observed in the two studies that have been conducted in rats. These rat studies included doses higher than those which gene rally caused immune effects in mice. Relative liver weight was evaluated along with immune parameters in nine of the 13 studies of adult mice. In all of these nine studies, the LOAEL for increased relative liver weight was the same or lower than the LOA EL for immune system effects. As shown in Table 13, the lowest dose at which immune effects were clearly demonstrated in mice is 0.49 mg/kg/day in a 21- day drinking water study, with no NOAEL reported (Son et al., 2009). Increased liver weight also occurred at this dose in this study, as reported in the accompanying paper (Son et al., 2008). Therefore, the data available at this time suggest that increased r elative liver weight is an endpoint that is as sensitive as or more sensitive than immune system effects in rats and mice . For this reason, immune system effects from toxicology studies were not used as the basis for the dose-response in this risk assessm ent, and individual study tables are not provided for these studies. Reproductive and Developmental Effects Overview As discussed in the Pharmacokinetics section (above), PFOA exposures in the developing human fetus are similar to those experienced by the mother, and neonatal exposure from breast -feeding or consuming formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is much higher than in the mother or othe r older individuals using the same drinking water source. As discussed in the Epidemiology section, prenatal exposure to PFOA is associated with decreased birth weight in human epidemiology studies (Johnson et al., 2014). Reproductive or developmental e ffects of PFOA have not been studied in non- human primates. Prior to 2006, the reproductive and developmental effects of PFOA had been studied only in rats and rabbits. These species are not the most appropriate models for evaluation of the potential for human reproductive and developmental effects of PFOA because the half -life of PFOA in female rats and female (as well as male) rabbits is only a few hours ( see Table 4 in Toxicokinetics section). Because of this rapid elimination, serum levels from a given dose of PFOA in females of these species are much lower than in other species with long half -lives, such as mice and humans, and PFOA does not reach steady state in fem ales of these species with daily dosing by gavage. Beginning in 2006, the reproductive and developmental toxicity of PFOA has been studied in mice. The mouse is a more appropriate species for evaluating the potential human effects of PFOA on reproduction and development, since the female mouse excretes PFOA slowly and steady state is achieved with continued dosing. As discussed in detail below, effects observed in mice include full litter resorptions, decreased postnatal survival and growth, delayed development, and accelerated sexual maturation in males . More recent studies have found that 1 23 delayed mammary gland development is caused by developmental exposure to doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day. I n this section, the mouse studies of developmental and re productive effects from gestational dosing with PFOA are presented in Table 12 and discussed in the text. This is followed by a detailed discussion of effects of developmental exposures to PFOA on mammary gland development, the most sensitive developmental endpoint with serum data appropriate for dose- response modeling. Summaries of a dditional studies of effects of pre-pubertal exposure to PFOA on reproductive organs in female mice, and of reproductive effect in male mice, are then presented. Finally, the studies of developmental and reproductive effects in rats and rabbits that were conducted prior to the mouse studies are summarized. Mouse developmental studies Summary of study designs Table 12 summarizes data on reproductive and developmental effects from gestational and/or lactational exposure to PFOA in mice. Sixteen publications reporting such studies are included in the table. Several of these publications include multiple studies with different exposure protocols, in one case, different aspects of the same study are described in two publications (Wolf et al., 2007; White et al., 2009). In total, 18 separate studies, three of which used multiple strains of mice, are reported. Mo st but not all of the studies assessed both maternal/reproductive endpoints and developmental endpoints in the offspring. The table includes the six publications that evaluated developmental effects of PFOA on mammary gland development in the dam and/or the female offspring, as well as other endpoints. Effects on mammary gland development are further discussed in detail in a separate section below. S everal additional studies of effects of gestational dosing with PFOA are not included in the Table 12 because they did not evaluate standard reproductive or developmental endpoints and/or because they used non-standard exposure protocols. These papers are discussed elsewhere in this document. These include two studies of histopathological changes in the livers of mice in adulthood after low dose developmental exposures (Filgo et al., 2015; Quist et al., 2015), a study of intestinal tumorigenesis in wild type and genetically susceptible strains of mice (Ngo et al., 2014), and three studies of neurobehavioral effects at age 5-8 weeks in offspring of dams dosed during gestation (Johansson et al., 2008; Onishchenko et al., 2011; Sobolewski et al., 2014). Most (11 of 16) of the studies in Table 12 used CD-1 mice, three used C57Bl/6 mice, one study (Tucker et al., 2015) used both strains, and one study used ICR mice (Yahia et al., 2010). Two studies included strains of mice with differ ingnt PPAR -alpha status (wild type, null, and/or humanized) and are discussed in more detail in the Mode of Action section. I n most of the studies (13), dosing was by oral gavage, while one study used drinking water exposure (Hu et al., 2010), one study used drinking water exposure with or without additional 124 gavage exposure in some , but not all , dose groups (White et al., 2011b), and one study used dietary exposure (van Esterik et al., 2016). In most of the studies (10), the dams were dosed with PFOA throughout gestation, and postnatal development of the offspring was assessed. However, other protocols were used in some studies. In two studies (Hu et al., 2012; van Esterik et al., 2016) , maternal dosing began before mating and continued until weaning. In other studies, the dosing period was shorter than the full period of gestation. Fenton et al. (2009) was primarily a pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of PFOA administered on GD 17 and is included because offspring body weight was assessed. In several other studies, PFOA was administered for only a portion of gestation (Hu et al., 2010, GD 6 -17; Macon et al., 2011 \"late gestation study\", 10 -17; Suh et al., 2011, White et al., 2007 \"restricted exposure study\", GD 1- 17, 8- 17, and 12 -17; Wolf et al., 2007, \"restricted exposure study\", GD 7- 17, 10- 17, 13 -17, and 15- 17). Two studies , one with exposure on GD 8 -17 (White et al., 2009) and one with exposure on GD 1- 17 (Wolf et al., 2007; White et al., 2009) used a cross -fostering protocol in which offspring were exposed during gestation and/or lactation. In these studies, treated dams were dosed during gestation. The dams that were not dosed but fostered pups from dosed dams were exposed to PFOA via grooming of the pups and ingestion of excreted pup urine and feces. One study (White et al.; 2011b) was a multi- generation study in which effects on three generations were evaluated (P0, F1, and F2). Effects on P0 dams and F1 offspring are shown in Table 12; complete information on the study is presented in the section on mammary gland development (below). Most of the studies (15) ass essed both maternal/reproductive endpoints and endpoints of postnatal developmental in the offspring, although the specific endpoints that were evaluated differed among studies. Only two of the studies evaluated malformations at birth. These were Lau et al . (2006), which also evaluated postnatal development, and Yahia et al. (2010). Two studies (Macon et al., 2011, and Tucker et al., 201 5) assessed effects in the offspring, but not maternal or reproductive effects. Several studies focused on specific effects in addition to standard developmental endpoints or mammary gland development. Hines et al. (2009) evaluated effects in female offspr ing of developmental exposures on body weight and hormones (insulin and leptin) in adulthood. Hu et al. (2010) and Hu et al. (2012) assessed effects of developmental exposures on immune endpoints at age 7 to 9 weeks and are also included in the summary ta ble of immune effects (Table 13). Finally , Suh et al. (2011) focused on placental toxicity and other reproductive endpoints, and did not evaluate the offspring. Two additional studies assessed the effects of pre -pubertal exposure to PFOA on the reproduct ive system in female mouse pups (Dixon et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2014). These are not included in the table and are discussed in the text later in this section. Maternal and reproductive effects PFOA caused reproductive effects in mice including increases in full litter resorptions (Abbott et al., 2007), increased litter loss, prenatal loss per live litter, or fetal resorptions/dead fetus (Abbott 1 25 et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2006; Suh et al., 2011; White et al., 2007; White et al., 2011b), and decreased numb er of live fetuses per litter or decreased litter size (Lau et al., 2006; Suh et al., 2010; van Esterik et al., 2016; Wolf et al., 2007; White et al., 2011b). In all of these studies, one or more of these reproductive effects occurred at doses below those which caused decreased maternal weight gain, an indicator of general maternal toxicity. P FOA caused toxicity to the placenta, including decreased placental weight, decreased fetal/placental weight ratio, and decreased expression of genes for prolactin family hormones (hormones that support fetal growth and nutrition), aft er treatment on GD 11 -16 at the lowest dose tested , 2 mg/kg/day (Suh et al., 2011). Higher doses caused placental necrosis and reduced numbers of placental trophoblast cells. These results suggest that placental toxicity may contribute to the increased number of dead fetuses/decreased number of live fetus es and decreased fetal growth observed in this and other developmental studies of PFOA. E ffects on maternal relative liver weight and maternal mammary gland development are discussed below. Effects in Offspring: Fetal through Weaning Fetal teratology Two studies evaluated fetal teratology. In CD-1 mice, gestational exposure to PFOA caused reduced ossification of phalanges , limb and tail defects, and microcardia at doses below those which affected maternal weight gain (Lau et al., 2006). Reduced ossif ication of proximal phalanges of both the forelimb and the hindlimb was significantly increased at the lowest dose used (1 mg/kg/day) but was not significantly increased in some higher dosed groups. This effect represents a delay in timing of development rather than a permanent structural change, since the phalanges developed normally in mice treated with PFOA that were not sacrificed prior to delivery in this study (personal communication with C. Lau). Ossifica tion at other sites (caudal vertebrae, metacarpals, and metatarsals) was delayed only at a much higher dose (20 mg/kg/day) which also caused maternal and reproductive toxicity. I n ICR mice, gestational exposure to PFOA caused increased incidence of cleft sternum, delayed ossification of phalanges, and delayed incisor eruption. The LOAEL and NOAEL for increased incidence of cleft sternum, delayed ossification of phalanges, delayed incisor eruption were 10 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively (Yahia et al., 2010). In this study, maternal weight gain, fetal weight, and pup survival until PND 4, were significantly decreased at dose(s) below the LOAEL for increased cleft sternum, delayed ossification, and delayed incisor eruption. No pups survived until PND 4 at 10 mg/kg/day, the LOAEL for delayed ossification. B irth weight, and growth and postnatal development until weaning PFOA caused decreased body weight at birth, postnatal mortality, reduced postnatal growth until weaning, and delayed development (as indicated by day of eye opening) in mice. As shown in Table 12, one or more of these effects was reported by Abbott et al. (2007), Hines et al. (2009), 126 Hu et al. (2010), Hu et al. (2012), Lau et al. (2006), Tucker et al. ( 2015), van Esterik et al. (2016), White et al. (2007), White et al. (2009), Wolf et al. (2007), White et al. (2011b), and Yahia et al. (2010). Exposure dur ing only the latter part of gestation (GD 15 -17) was sufficient to cause decreased body weight at birth, increased postnatal mortality, and decreased postnatal growth (Wolf et al., 2007). Furthermore, decreased postnatal growth result ed from either gestat ional or lactational exposure, as shown by the results of the cross -fostering study by White et al. (2009). Effects on relative liver weight and mammary gland development during the period from birth until weaning are discussed below. Effects in Offspring: Post -Weaning In studies which continued to assess offspring during the post -weaning period, effects at these later time points were observed in some studies (summarized below) but not in others (e.g. no effect on body weight in Abbott et al., 2007, or on immune parameters in Hu et al., 2012). In the restricted exposure component of Wolf et al. (2007), developmental exposure to 5 mg/kg/day PFOA beginning on GD 10 caused decreased body weight in male offspring until age 10-11 weeks. In the cross fostering study component of the same publication, body weight remained decreased until PND 36 in male offspring after in utero and lactational exposure to 5 mg/kg/day PFOA, and until PND 85 in females exposed to the same dose in utero even without postna tal exposure from breastmilk . Markers of sexual maturation (vaginal opening and first estrus) were delayed in female CD -1 mouse offspring with gestational exposure to PFOA. However, sexual maturation (preputial separation) in male offspring was accelerated by PFOA exposure, despite the fact that PFOA caused decreased body weight at 6.5 weeks of age (Lau et al., 2006). Notably, acceleration puberty in males did not follow a typical dose -response curve. The greatest acceleration occurred at the lowest do se (1 mg/kg/day) with a smaller effect at each increasing dose. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg/day), puberty was delayed rather than accelerated. Body weight and hormone ( insulin and leptin) levels were increased in early adulthood (20- 29 weeks) in CD -1 mice with gestational exposure to low doses (0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg/day for obesity; 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg/day for hormones) but not at higher doses. In this study, body weight at birth or early in life was not affected by the low doses that caused increased body w eight later in life (Hines et al., 2009). In contrast, Ngo et al. (2014) found no effect on body weight at age 12- 20 weeks in male or female wild type or Min/+ ( a strain susceptible to intestinal tumorigenesis) C57Bl/6 mice offspring of dams dosed with 0.01, 0.1, and 3 mg/kg/day PFOA during gestation. These studies are of interest because several epidemiology studies evaluated associations of prenatal and/or early life PFOA exposure with parameters associated with increased body weight in childhood or adulthood. Three studies found associations of maternal serum PFOA levels during pregnancy with increased risk of overweight/obesity and changes in metabolic hormones 127 in young women (Halldorsson et al., 2012), more rapid weight gain in girls (Maisonet et al., 2012), or greater adiposity and more rapid increase in BMI in childhood (Braun et al., 2016), while two studies did not find such an association with prenatal or early childhood exposure to PFOA (Andersen et al., 2013; Barry et al., 2014). Splenic T cells were decreased at age 6 weeks in C57Bl/6 mice exposed gestationally to 2 mg/kg/day PFOA, with no effect at 0.2 mg/kg/day (Hu et al., 2012). The NOAEL and LOAEL for this effect were the same as for decreased body weight gain on PND 1- 21, suggesting that the immune system effect from developmental exposure was not a more sensitive endpoint than other developmental effects in this study. Effects on relative liver weight and mammary gland development during the post -weaning period are discuss ed below. Relative liver weight Increased relative liver weight is a sensitive toxicological endpoint for PFOA. This effect was evaluated in dams and/or offspring in 12 of the 18 mouse developmental studies summarized in Table 12. Maternal relative liver weight was assessed at delivery in three studies, between delivery and weaning in two studies, and at weaning in five studies. In offspring, relative liver weight was evaluated at birth in two studies, between birth and weaning in three studies, at weaning in five studies, and post -weaning in five studies. The NOAELs and LOAELs for increased relative liver weight in dams and/or offspring and for other reproductive and developmental effects are presented in Table 12. ( Note : Fenton et al., 2009, is not included in this table because no effects were seen at the single dose used.) In all studies except one (Hu et al., 2010), the LOAEL and/or NOAEL for increased relative liver weight in the dam and/or the offspring is the same or lower than the LOAEL and/or NOAEL for reproductive developmental effects (other than delayed mammary gland development). In Hu et al. (2010), offspring liver weight was evaluated on PND 48 and PND 63; these are post -weaning time points at which PFOA was almost totally eliminated from the body. These data indicate that increased relative liver weight (maternal and/or offspring) is an endpoint for PFOA toxicity in mice that is as sensitive or more sensitive than most of the other reproductive and developm ental effects that were evaluated, with the exception of delayed mammary gland development which is discussed below. Mammary gland development Background information on mammary gland development as a toxicological endpoint Because the developmental patterns of the mammary gland are similar in humans and rodents, rodents provide a good model for studying the effects of environmental contaminant on human mammary gland development (Rudel and Fenton, 2009; Fenton et al. et al., 2011; Fenton and Bi rnbaum, 2015; Osborne et al., 2015). The development of the mammary gland in 128 these species involves a complex series of events that is regulated by a balance of hormones, growth factors and stromal factors (Osborne et al., 2015; Gore et al., 2015). Agents that affect any of these steps can interfere with the normal process of mammary gland development, and this process is particularly sensitive to effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals, including environmental contaminants such as bisphenol A, atrazine, and dioxin ( Gore et al., 2015; 2015; Fenton et al., 2012; IOM 2011; Rudel et al., 2011). As reviewed in detail below, adverse effects on mammary gland development are sensitive toxicological endpoints for PFOA, and a NOAEL for these effects has not been identified. The mammary gland is most sensitive to the effects of toxic substances during critical periods when development occurs including fetal, neonatal, puberty, and pregnancy ( Gore et al. , 2015; Osborne et al., 2015), while the mammary glands of non- pregnant adult females may not be affected by the same exposures. Adverse effects on the mammary gland from early life exposures can include accelerated or delayed development (Macon and Fenton, 2013; Osborne et al., 2015), and ef fects of the same chemical on mammary gland development may vary depending on the life stage when exposure occurs (Osborne et al., 2015). These disruptions of mammary gland development may result in adverse effects later in life including impaired lactati on and increased cancer risk (Fenton 2006; IOM, 2011; Rudel et al., 2011; Fenton et al., 2012). The mammary gland is distinct from other tissues in that it undergoes a significant portion of its development postnatally; in addition to the fetal/neonatal period, puberty and pregnancy are critical periods of mammary gland development (Osborne et al., 2015). The mammary gland grows and differentiates slowly during embryonic and juvenile life and does not mature until after puberty. Mammary gland development in rodents has been reviewed by Sakakura (1987) and Daniel and Silberstein (1987) and in humans by Russo and Russo (1987) and Howard and Gusterson (2000). The mammary gland is a n organ that is unique to the class Mammalia, and its embryonic, postnatal , and adult development is highly conserved between species. Mammary gland development in humans and rodents takes place at a similar biological pace, although the absolute timeframe s differ (Table 12 and Figure 10 , both from Fenton, 2006). The description of mammary gland development below is taken from c oncise summaries provided by Osborne et al. (2015) and Fenton et al. (2012). In rodents and humans , mammary gland development begins with the formation of the mammary, or milk line , during em bryonic development . This structure separates into individual placodes (areas of thickening of the ectodermal layer) , each of which develops into a ductal tree that embeds in a fat pad to form the mammary bud. Although there are slight timing differences in mammary gland development among species, ductal branching begins during the prenatal period in both rodents and humans. Subsequent to the fetal/ neonatal period , there is little epithelial growth until puberty. During puberty, exponential growth of the female mammary 129 gland occurs for several weeks in rodents and several years in humans. During puberty, the fat pad rapidly fills with epithelial cells to become the adult form of the gland. The epithelium develops bundles of ducts, which then form club- like structures, called terminal end buds (TEB) in humans. Each TEB cleaves into alveolar buds and sprouts into ductules , forming a structure called the terminal ductal lobular unit. In r odents , TEBs are the sites of future ductal branching and disappear as the gland differentiates , and they are the structures considered to be most functionally equivalent to the terminal ductal lobular unit in humans. TEBs are particularly susceptible to the effects of carcinogens, and it has been suggested that \"factors that lengthen the period when TEBs are present lengthen the period during which the mammary gland is susceptible to carcinogens (Osborne et al., 2015).\" After puberty, the mammary gland remains in a resting state until pregnancy occurs . During pregnancy, the gland undergoes another period of rapid differentiation, involving branching and the development of lobulo- alveoli to prepare for lactation . Table 9.

Timeline of critical periods of mammary gland development and potential effects of endocrine disrupting compounds on mammary gland development (Fenton, 2006). Effects on mammary gland development in rodents are commonly assessed by evaluation of \"whole mounts\". In this approach, the entire fourth and/or fifth abdominal mammary gland fat pad is mounted flat on a slide, fixed, stained, defatted, and permanently affixed to the slide. 130 Whole mounts are assessed microscopically for parameters such as numbers of mammary terminal ductal structures (i.e., TEBs, terminal ducts, alveolar buds, and lobules), extension of the epithelial cells through the fat pad, and branching patterns and density at different times during development branching (Rudel et al., 2011). Whole mounts were evaluated in the nine studies of the effe cts of PFOA on mammary gland development in mice described below, and tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were also e xamined in some of these studies. Effects on mammary gland development are reported as overall age -adjusted developme ntal scores based on a number of parameters and/or as quantitative values for specific parameters. Effects of PFOA on mammary gland development in mice Delayed mammary gland development in mice is a sensitive toxicological endpoint that is considered relev ant to humans because developmental patterns are similar in both species. Nine publications have reported the effects of PFOA on mammary gland development in mice, and some of these publications include multiple studies. These studies are summarized in T able 16, and details of each study are provided in an individual study table for each publication in Appendix 5. Information related to the mode of action of PFOA's effects on mammary gland development is reviewed in the Mode of Action section, below. Studies of effects of maternal and fetal/neonatal exposure to PFOA Six publications evaluated effects of PFOA exposure during gestation and/or lactation on mammary gland development. Studies presented in these publications are summarized in Table 16A, and details for each study are provided in Appendix 5. Some of these publications include multiple studies, and, in total, ten separate studies were reported. Nine of these studies reported delayed mammary gland development , and one reported no effect on mammary gland development. Five of these publications report studies in CD -1 mice (White et al., 2007, three studies ; White et al., 2009, two studies ; Macon et al., 2011, two studies ; White et al., 2011b; Tucker et al., 2015) , and one of these also includes C57Bl/6 mice (Tucker et al., 2015). The sixth publication evaluated wild type, PPAR -alpha nul l, and PPAR -alpha humanized mice of the Sv/129 genetic background (Albrecht et al., 2013). Nine of the ten studies evaluated fem ale offspring, and four of the studies (White et al., 2007; White et al., 2009; White et al., 2011b) evaluated pregnant and/or lactating dams. Effects on structure of the mammary gland development PFOA exposure during critical developmental periods (fe tal, neonatal, pregnancy, and lactation) caused delayed mammary gland development in both lactating dams (White et al., 2007; White et al., 2009; White et al., 2011b) and pups (White et al., 2007; White et al., 2009; Macon et al., 2011; White et al., 2011b; Tucker et al., 2015) , while even a high dose (5 mg/kg/day) did not affect mammary gland development in non- pregnant adult female mice (White et al., 2007). As shown in the comparison of LOAELs and NOAELs for mammary gland development and other endpoints in Table 12, mammary gland development was a more sensitive endpoint for PFOA than other effects found in dams and pups in mouse developmental studies including 131 reproductive endpoints (number of fetuses per litter, prenatal loss, prenatal survival), pubertal markers (day of vaginal opening or day of first estrus; Tucker et al., 2015), estrogen or progesterone levels (Tucker et al., 2015), body weight, or liver weight (Macon et al., 2011; Tucker et al., 2015 ). Lactating dams Delayed mammary gland develop ment occurred in lactating dams after dosing with PFOA during gestation (White et al., 2007; 2009; 2011b) or from exposure via treated pups (White et al., 2009). At the end of pregnancy just prior to initiation of nursing (GD 18; White et al., 2007) and on PND 1 after one day of nursing (White et al., 2009), mammary glands of treated dams were not saturated with milk filled alveoli, as is normally seen, but rather exhibited stunted, immature development. On PND 10, normally the peak of lactation, mammary glands from treated mice were delayed in development and resembled those normally seen earlier in lactation (White et al., 2007; 2009). On PND 20- 22, mammary glands from treated dams had milk- filled alveoli and resembled normal mammary glands at the peak of lactation on PND 10, instead of the normal involution that occurs at weaning, indicating delayed development of up to 10 days (White et al., 2007; 2011b). Female offspring Delayed mammary gland development occurred in female pups in both CD -1 and C57B l/6 strains (Tucker et al., 2015). In CD -1 mice, the mammary gland developmental score was significantly decreased compared to controls at all dose s including the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg/day ). In C57Bl/6 mice, the developmental score was decreased compar ed to controls at all doses at both timepoints assessed (PND 21 and PND 61). However, t his difference was not statistically significant at the two lowest doses (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kd/day) , but was significant at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day. Serum PFOA levels in C5 7Bl6 pups were lower than in CD -1 pups at the same administered dose. Lack of statistical significance in C57Bl/6 offspring at the two lowest doses may be due to the lower serum PFOA levels and/or small number of animals in the two lower dose groups for this strain (n=2 -5 per dose group) as compared to CD -1 mice (n=8 -22 per dose group) , rather than differences in intrinsic sensitivity to effects of PFOA on mammary gland development in the two strains mice (Tucker et al., 2015). It should be noted that the LOAELs in female offspring for other well -established developmental effects of PFOA (decreased body weight and increased relative liver weight, both on PND 21) were also higher in C57Bl/6 mice than in CD -1 mice in this study, possibly due to the factors me ntioned above. PFOA is found in breast milk after maternal exposure in both rodents and humans, resulting in lactational exposure to offspring (reviewed in Post et al., 2012; also Mogensen et al., 2015). Cross-fostering studies in which pups with no prenatal exposure were exposed via breast milk from exposed dams , and pups with prenatal exposure were fostered by untreated dams, show that delayed mammary gland development result s from exposure during gestation, lactation, or both. Significant delays in mammary gland development occurred as early as PND 1 in non- gestationally exposed pups nursing from treated dams for only 12- 24 hours, and as early as PND 1 32 3 in non- gestationally ex posed dams nursing treated pups. The exposure in these dams was only through maternal behavior such as ingestion of treated pups' waste and grooming of treated pups (White et al., 2009). I n White et al. (2009), effects on the mammary gland persisted in exposed offspring until 18 months of age, long after PFOA had been eliminated from the body; these effects are considered to be permanent. Although the study was not designed to quantitatively evaluate mammary gland development in older animals, epithelia l density appeared to be reduced in the mammary glands of exposed animals at 18 months. An increase in the number of unusual darkly staining foci per gland of approximately 5-fold was also seen at 18 months in the mammary glands of exposed mice. According to the authors, these foci appeared to result from hyperplasia of ductal epithelium, infiltration of inflammatory cells into ductal regions, increased stromal density surrounding the ducts, and/or inappropriate differentiation of the ductal epithelium. G ore et al. (2015) notes that abnormalities of this type can be associated with increased breast cancer risk. M ammary gland development, as assessed on PND 21 by overall developmental score, number of terminal end buds, and other measures of mammary gland development, was delayed in a dose-related fashion in CD-1 mouse pups after late gestational exposure (GD 10-17) to doses lower than those used in earlier studies (Macon et al., 2011). The LOAEL was 0.01 mg/kg/day, with no NOAEL identified. These effec ts occurred at serum PFOA levels of 285 ng/ml or below, lower than the mean serum level (371 ng/ml) in a community exposed to highly contaminated drinking water (Emmett et al., 2006 a). I n a multi-generation study of CD-1 mice exposed to 5000 ng/L (5 \u00b5g/L) PFOA in drinking water, mammary gland development was delayed in both F1 dams (PND 22) and F1 female pups (PND 22, 42, and 63) at serum levels relevant to human environmental exposures (White et al., 2011b). Pups were significantly affected at serum levels as low as 21.3 ng/ml on PND 22 (compared 0.6 ng/ml in controls at this time point). This serum level is below the mean serum level of 28 ng/ml in the six Ohio and West Virginia communities with contaminated drinking water that comprise the C8 Health St udy population, and is within about 10-fold of the mean and 4-fold of the 95 th percentile serum levels in the U.S. general population (CDC, 2015). This serum level would be expected in humans with ongoing exposure to drinking water concentrations of approximately 200 ng/L (0.2 \u00b5g/L), based on the serum:drinking water ratios discussed above. I n contrast to the delays in mammary gland development observed in CD-1 and C57Bl/6 mice in the five studies discussed above, no significant effects on mammary gland development were found in wild type, PPAR-alpha null, or humanized PPAR-alpha Sv/129 mouse pups exposed gestationally to 3 mg/kg/day PFOA (Albrecht et al., 2013). This is the only study of mammary gland development in these strains. Albrecht et al. (2013) report that postnatal lethality occurred in the wild type mice, but not in the PPAR -alpha null or humanized PPAR- alpha mice. They conclude that the study confirms the PPAR-alpha dependent postnatal lethality of PFOA 1 33 previously reported by Abbott et al. (2007). However, several problematic issues with this study limit the consideration of its results: A lthough postnatal lethality in wild type mice treated with 3 mg/kg/day (the only dose used in the study) on PND 20 was reported as statistically signifi cant (p<0.05), this conclusion appears to be based on an inappropriate statistical comparison. In evaluating postnatal lethality, the number of pups per litter on PND 20 in the control and PFOA- treated groups of wild type mice were compared. However, this comparison does not appear to be valid because the control and PFOA treated litters initially had different numbers of pups on PND0. The appropriate evaluation of this parameter is a comparison of the number of pupswithin the same litter on PND 0 and PND 20 (i.e. percent mortality within the litter between PND 0 and PND 20). In wild type pups, 96% of controls and 70% of PFOA-treated survived from PND 0 to PND 20. From the analysis presented, it is unclear whether postnatallethality is actually signif icantly increased by PFOA in wild type pups. For this reason, the basis for the conclusion that wild type, but not humanized PPAR- alpha, mice are sensitive to developmental effects of PFOA is uncertain. A n important concern is that Albrecht et al. (2013) state that elevated PFOA levels (up to > 1000 ng/ml) were found in liver and serum from some control fetuses, pups, and dams.However, no further information such as which groups of animals these samples came from,how many samples had elevated PFOA conce ntrations, or statistical data for serum levels in the control samples is provided. Importantly, data from control animals with elevated PFOA exposures do not appear to have been excluded in the comparisons of endpoints of toxicity in control and treated groups. Inclusion of these data from the control animalscould have affected the results of these comparisons, especially since serum levels in someof the treated groups were only a few fold higher than those in some of the controls. D evelopmental effects observed in the same strain of mice (SV/129) in another study (Abbott et al., 2007) at lower doses (0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day) were not observed at the higherdose ( 3 mg/kg/day ) used by Albrecht et al. (2013). Abbott et al. (2007) observed significantly incre ased postnatal lethality in wild type pups exposed gestationally to 0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day PFOA. Additionally, eye opening was significantly delayed in the 0.6 and 1mg/kg/day wild type pups in Abbott et al. (2007), but not at 3 mg/kg/day in Albrecht et al. (2013). A lthough both studies used SV/129 mice, Albrecht et al. (2013) obtained them from NIH and Abbott et al. (2007) obtained them from Jackson Laboratories. Albrecht et al. (2013)suggest that pharmacokinetic differences in the wild type mice from th e two different sources may explain the differences in effects of PFOA in these mice in the two studies.However, a close review of the data from the two studies (Table 3 of Abbott et al., 2007;Figure 10 of Albrecht et al., 2013) indicates that the serum levels in wild type pups inAlbrecht et al. (2013) at which no developmental effects occurred were higher than the 134 serum levels in wild type pups at which delayed eye opening and postnatal morta lity were reported by Abbott et al. (2007). Furthermore, the serum PFOA data for wild type dams on PND 20 appear to be inconsistent within the publication. Maternal serum levels in wild type dams on PND 20 are stated to range from 2066 - 6812 ng/ml, and no statistical parameters (e.g. median, mean, S.D.) are provided. However, the estimated serum level from the bar graph of maternal serum levels is 6700+ 3600 in the wild type dams (higher than what would be expected from the range provided in the text). In summary, no effect of PFOA on mammary gland development was reported in pups from the three strains on PND 20; this is the only study that evaluated PFOA's effect on this endpoint in these strains. It is possible that these strains are less sensitive to this effect than are the other strains in which effects were reported. However, the general issues with this study create uncertainty about its conclusions related to mammary gland development . As discussed above, the inclusion of data from controls w ith elevated PFOA exposures may have affected the ability to observe effects in treated groups. Pertinent data on serum levels is not presented or appears to be presented inconsistently. The differences in developmental effects in wild type pups in Albrecht et al. (2013) versus Abbott et al. (2007) cannot be explained on the basis of pharmacokinetic differences in the two studies, since effects occurred at pup serum levels in Abbott et al. (2007) that are lower than the pup serum levels in Albrecht et al. (2013). Effects on milk quality and quantity In dams exposed to PFOA during pregnancy, the morphological delays observed in mammary glands during lactation suggest that milk production and/or composition may be impacted. Potentially relevant to this issue , maternal PFOA exposure was associated with shorter duration of breast feeding in all three human studies that evaluated this effect (Fei et al., 2010; Romano et al., 2016; Timmermann et al., 2016). However, the available toxicological information is not sufficient to make conclusions about the effects of developmental exposure to PFOA on lactational function, as only one study (White et al., 2007) evaluated effects on the composition of milk, and only one study (White et al., 2011b) evaluated the amount of milk produced. Evaluation of effects on growth of offspring is complicated by the fact that PFOA itself can cause decreased postnatal growth in mouse pups from only in utero exposure in a cross -fostering study (Wolf et al., 2007). Therefore, effe cts on postnatal growth could result from the intrinsic toxicity of PFOA and/or from decreased lactational function. In the only toxicological study of effects on milk composition, e xpression of genes for four milk proteins (beta -casein, EGF, alpha -Lac, and LactoF) in mammary gland tissue were altered in dams exposed to 5 mg/kg/day PFOA during gestation. For example, peaks in LactoF expression normally seen early and late in lactation were delayed, consistent with the observed structural delays in mammar y gland development at these time points (White et al., 2007). The only toxicological data on effects of prenatal and early life exposure to PFOA on milk production in adulthood comes from the two- generation study in CD -1 mice (White et al., 135 2011b). The design of this study is shown in Figure 11. As part of this study, a lactational challenge experiment was conducted in F1 dams and their F2 litters on PND 10, the time point at which lactation is at its peak. Except for the dose group receiving 5000 ng/L ( 5 \u00b5g/L) PFOA in drinking water throughout the experiment, the F1 dams that were evaluated for lactational function were exposed prenatally and in neonatal life until weaning through breast milk, but not after weaning or while pregnant and lactating . Milk production was evaluated by weighing a litter of 10 F2 pups before and after a nursing period of 30 minutes. There were no statistically significant effects on milk production, as measured by weight gain in the litter, or on time to initiate nursin g behavior. However, high variability, the small number of animals assessed, and the lack of sensitivity of this assay may have limited the ability to detect effects on lactational function. Additionally, postnatal survival and body weight were not affect ed in the F2 pups, indicating that the ability of the F1 dams to provide nutritional support was not decreased. The authors note that it is not known whether deficits in lactational function were present, but were compensated for by increased frequency or longer duration of nursing events, since these parameters were not assessed. Possibly r elevant to this issue, the three available human studies all suggest that maternal exposure to PFOA may be related to shorter duration of breastfeeding. A study of 1400 Danish women from the general population found that serum PFOA concentration during early pregnancy was associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding among multiparous, but not nulliparous, women (Fei et al., 2010). Because women who breastfed pr eviously were more likely to so again, and because longer duration of lactation would result in decreased serum PFOA due to excretion via breast milk, reverse causality could not be ruled out. A second study evaluated 336 U.S. women from a community with median serum PFOA levels about twice those in the U.S. general population, possibly due to past exposure to contaminated drinking water (Romano et al., 2016). Finally, Timmermann et al. (2016) found an association of serum PFOA (median - 2.40 ng/ml) and duration of breastfeeding in Faroese women (n=1092). In contrast to Fei et al. (2010), both Romano et al. (2016) and Timmermann et al. (2016) controlled for prior breast feeding history. Notably, serum PFOA levels during pregnancy were associated with shorter duration of breast feeding even after adjustment for previous breast feeding in these two studies. 136 Figure 11. White et al.

Studies of effects of peripubertal exposure to PFOA Three studies reported effects of peripubertal (during periods between 3 and 7 weeks of age) exposure to PFOA on mammary gland development in female mice. Studies pre sented in these publications are summarized in Table 16B, and details for each study are provided in Appendix 5. Two studies used C57Bl/6 and Balb/C mice (Yang et al., 2009a ; Zhao et al, 2012). One of these studies (Zhao et al., 2012) and an additional st udy (Zhao et al., 2010) evaluated C57Bl/6 PPAR -alpha null mice. Data on serum PFOA levels from all three of these studies are presented in Zhao et al. (2012). Interpretation of the combined results of these three studies is problematic because each PFOA dose level was used in each strain in only one of the three studies, and any dose-response interpretations must be made based on combining data from different studies. Because conditions (e.g. animals, housing conditions, time) may vary during different s tudies, dose-response curves based on combining data from different studies are difficult to interpret and conclusions based on such dose -response curves are highly uncertain. Yang et al. (2009 a) reported stimulation of mammary gland development in C57B l/6 mice at 1 and mg/kg/day PFOA , complete inhibition at 10 mg/kg/day. In contrast, mammary gland development was inhibited at these three doses in a dose -related manner in Balb/c mice in this same study (Yang et al., 2009a ). A subsequent study (Zhao et al. 2012) attempted to further elucidate the dose response for mammary gland effects in these two strains by using a single dose in between those used in the first study in each strain (2.5 mg/kg/day in Balb/c; 7.5 mg/kg/day in C57Bl/6) . Mammary g land development was inhibited at these doses in both strains. However, the doses used in the Yang et al. (2009) were not repeated in Zhao et al. (2012), and, importantly, the stimulatory effects 137 reported at 1 and 5 mg/kg/day in C57Bl/6 mice by Yang et al . (2009 a) were not replicated in Zhao et al. (2012). It is important to note that the stimulation of mammary gland development in C57Bl/6 mice exposed to 5 mg/kg/day by Yang et al. (2009 a) was not replicated in a second study. Additionally, this observation does not contradict the findings of delayed mammary development in this strain after gestational exposure (Tucker et al., 2015), since effects on mammary gland development may differ d epending on life stage of exposure. In C57Bl/6 PPAR -alpha null mice, mammary gland development was not affected by 7.5 mg/kg/day PFOA (Zhao et al., 2012), and was reported to be stimulated at 5 mg/kg/day, although quantitative data are not shown by Zhao e t al. (2010). As was the case for the studies of C57Bl/6 wild type mice and Balb/C mice discussed above, each dose was used in PPAR -alpha null mice in only one of the studies (Zhao et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012). The effects on mammary gland development in the PPAR -alpha null mice therefore were similar to those in wild type mice of the same strain at 5 mg/kg/day and differed at 7.5 mg/kg/day. As above, interpretation of these data is problematic because only one dose was used in each study. Effects o f pre- pubertal PFOA exposure on reproductive organs in female mice Two studies evaluated effects of pre- pubertal exposure to PFOA on reproductive organs in female mice. Groups of female CD -1 mouse pups (8 per group) to 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg/day were expose d to PFOA by gavage for three days starting on PND 18 (Dixon et al., 2012) and sacrificed one day after the last dose. Uterine weight (absolute and relative) was significantly increased (about 1.5- fold) only at 0.01 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose, while body w eight was not affected by any dose of PFOA. As expected in this model, administration of 17- beta- estradiol greatly increased uterine weight by about 10 -fold, and PFOA had no effect on uterine weight in the estradiol treated animals. In mice treated with P FOA alone, histopathological changes in the uteri in some, but not all, sections included minimal to mild endometrial and myometrial edema, and hyperplasia of the mucosal and endometrial glandular epithelia and smooth muscle layers. There was also focal mi nimal stromal edema of the cervix and focal areas of mucification of the vagina in some, but not all, sections from PFOA treated mice. The severity scores for these changes were statistically significant (p<0.05) only in the low dose (0.01 mg/kg/day) and may have contributed to the increased uterine weight in this dose group, indicating a non -monotonic dose response curve for this effect. In reproductive organs from mice treated with estradiol, histological changes that are known to result from estradiol were observed and t hese changes were more severe than those seen in PFOA treated mice. The authors note that PFOA did not appear to have anti -estrogenic effects in this study, since it did not decrease the uterine weight gain induced by estradiol, and tha t more research is needed regarding the mechanism for the observed histopathologic effects of PFOA. In a second study of similar design, groups of 15 female CD -1 mouse pups were dosed with 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg/day PFOA for 3 days beginning on GD -18 (Yao et al., 1 38 2014). Another group of 15 female mouse pups was dosed with 17- beta-estradiol (0.5 mg/kg/day) for the same 3-day time period. Mice were sacrificed one day after the last dose. In this study, PFOA did not affect relative uterine weight at any dose, while estradiol caused the expected increase in relative uterine weight. Body weight was not affected by PFOA or estradiol treatment. In histological examination of the uterus, cervix, and vagina from 5 mice from each treatment group , there were no differences in types or severity of observations between controls and PFOA treated groups, while estradiol treatment produced the expected histopathological changes. In uterine tissue from the other 10 mice per treatment group, expression of estrogen receptor target genes in the uterus was not changed in PFOA -treated mice. Additionally, the human estrogen receptor was not activated by PFOA in vitro studies. Based on these results, the authors concluded that PFOA does not activate the mouse or human estrogen receptor. Reproductive effects in male mice Adverse reproductive effects were observed in f our studies of male mice. L i et al. (2011) studied the effects of 6 weeks of oral exposure to 0, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day APFO in wild mice. Serum testosterone was significantly decreased and the percentage of abnormal sperm was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in wild type and humanized PPAR- alpha mice, but not in PPAR- alpha null mice. Histopathological examination of the testis found increased vacuolated cells in the seminiferous tubules of wild type and humanized PPAR-alpha at both doses, while no obvious effects occurred in the PPAR -alpha null mice. M ale Balb/C mice (10 per group) were dosed with PFOA by gavage for 28 days with 0, 0.31, 1.25, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (Zhang et al., 2014). Sperm parameters were evaluated in five mice from the control and 5 mg/kg/day groups, histopathological studies were performed on testes from three mice from each dose group, and testes from the remaining animals were used in mode of action studies not described here. Relative testes weight was not affected by PFOA treatment, and absolute testes weight was decreased only at the highest dose (20 mg/kg/day). S perm numbers, sperm motility, and sperm progression were significantly decreased, and percent teratosperm was markedly and significantly increased, by treatment with 5 mg/kg/day PFOA. Histopathological examination found no differences in testes in the two lower dose groups (0.31 and 1.25 mg/kg/day) as compared to controls, while the seminiferous tubules in the testes of the two higher dose groups (5 and 20 mg/kg/day) were severely damaged. I n a second study from this research group, fer tility of male Balb/C mice (6 -8 weeks old) was significantly reduced after 28 days of gavage dosing with 5 mg/kg/day PFOA (Lu et al., 2015). The number of mated females and the number of pregnant females per male mouse were significantly decreased by treatment of the males with PFOA . Further studies found that the blood-testis barrier was disrupted after 28 days of exposure to 1.25 or 5 mg/kg/day. 139 Finally, Liu et al. (2015), reported testicular toxicity in Kunming mice dosed with 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg/da y PFOA for 14 days. Testicular damage including atrophy of seminiferous tubules, disrupted arrangement of spermatogenic cells, depletion of spermatagonial cells, detachment of germ cells from seminiferous epithelium, and decreased sperm production occurre d in all treated groups, with severity increasing with dose. Epididymal sperm count was decreased in a dose - related fashion, with no NOAEL identified. Other parameters evaluated in this study are discussed in the Mode of Action section. These adverse reproductive effects in male mice are in contrast to the results of the two generation study in rats (Butenhoff et al., 2004b, see below). In this study, mating, fertility, and sperm parameters in F0 and F1 male rats were unaffected by PFOA at up to 30 mg /kg/day. Additionally, Cui et al. (2009) did not observe distinct histopathological changes in the testes of male Sprague- Dawley rats treated with 5 or 20 mg/kg/day of PFOA for 28 days and found that testes weight relative to body weight was significantly increased at both doses. As discussed below, PFOA increased the incidence of testicular Leydig cell tumors in two chronic studies of male rats (Biegel et al., 2001; Butenhoff et al., 2012) . In the chronic study of male rats dosed with 13.6 mg/kg/day PFOA in the diet for 24 months (Biegel et al., 2001), absolute testes weight was significantly increased by PFOA at 24 months but not at 21 months or earlier time points. Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits As discussed above, the rat and the rabbit are not the most appropriate animal models for human reproductive and developmental effects of PFOA because of their rapid excretion of this chemical in female rats and both male and female rabbits. Studies of reproductive and developmental effects in these species are summarized below. Rabbit developmental study Gortner (1982, cited in USEPA, 2005a ) studied developmental effects in New Zealand white rabbits (18/dose group) given 0, 1.5, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day PFOA on gestation days 6 -18. Maternal body weight was decreased in treated groups on GD 6- 9 but returned to control levels on GD 12- 29. Parameters such as number of resorptions and implantations, and fetal viability, sex ratio, and weight, were not affected by treatment. A dose related increase in incidence of the skeletal variation, extra ribs or 13 th rib, was observed, with incidence of 16, 20, 30, and 38% in the 0, 1.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg/groups. This increase was statistically significant in the highest dose group. Rat studies Rat developmental study Gortner (1981, cited in USEPA, 2005a ) gave Sprague -Dawley rats (22/dose group) 0, 0.05, 1.5, 5, and 150 mg/kg/day APFO on gestation days 6- 15. The maternal NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day and the LOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day, based on decreased body weight, ataxia, and mortality seen only in the high dose group. Param eters including number of resorptions and implantations, or fetal viability, sex ratio of offspring, and pup weight, were not affected by treatment. A significantly increased incidence of missing sternebrae occurred in the high dose group. Since 1 40 this eff ect was also seen in the control and lower dose groups at lower frequency, the study authors did not believe that it was treatment related. Two-generation rat reproductive study A two -generation reproductive study in Sprague-Dawley rats using gavage doses of 0, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day APFO was conducted by York (2002) and was also reported by Butenhoff et al. (2004b). Various parameters related to reproduction and development, as well as general toxicology endpoints , were evaluated in each generation (F0, F1, F2). Because of the design of the study, some observed effects may have been due to developmental/reproductive toxicity and others due to adult toxicity (USEPA, 2005a ). T he parental (F0) generation (30 per sex per group) were dosed for at least 70 days prior to cohabitation beginning at age 6 weeks and until after mating in males and through pregnancy and lactation until weaning of pups for females. Males of the F0 generation were sacrificed after mating , and females were sacrificed at weaning of offspring on PND 22. M ean serum levels on the day of sacrifice in the F0 males in the control, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day groups were 34 ng/ml, 51,500 ng/ml and 45,300 ng/ml, with no increase in serum levels with increasing dose. In females, serum leve ls were much lower , < 5 ng/ml, 370 ng/ml, and 1020 ng/ml in the control, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day groups. Serum levels were not measured in the 1 and 3 mg/kg/day groups. I n the F0 males, there were no effects on mating, fertility, or sperm parameters. There were dose- related statistically significant decreases in body weight and body weight gain at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day of 6, 11, and 25%, respectively, although relative food consumption was increased in these groups. Liver weights (absolute, relative to body weight, and relative to brain weight ) were increased significantly in all dose groups (1 mg/kg/day and above). Kidney weights were also increased relative to brain and liver weights in all dose groups. Livers and kidneys were not examined histologically. Reproductive and endocrine organs were examined histologically, and hypertrophy and/or vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands were seen in 20% of the 10 mg/kg/day group and 70% of the 30 mg/kg/day group. I n F0 females, there were no effects on estrous cyclicity, mating, fertility, pup sex ratio, pup viability, pup birth weight, or other related parameters. Relative kidney weights were reduced at 30 mg/kg/day, and relative liver weight was reduced at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. This dec rease in relative liver weight is in contrast to findings in many other studies in which increased liver weight increases occurred. Histological examination was not performed on the kidneys or liver s. Lau et al. (2006) concluded that the profile of maternal effects in the rat study differed from those seen in similar studies in mice because of the more rapid excretion in the adult female rat compared to the adult female mouse. 141 Dosing of F1 offspring with the same dose levels that their parents had receiv ed began at weaning (PND 22). Most of the F1 animals were sacrificed after sexual maturation (about 5 weeks in females and 7 weeks in males). From the F1 generation, 30 pairs per dose group were selected to be bred to produce the F2 generation. These F1 males were sacrificed at about 133 days of age, after 113 days of treatment, and F1 females were sacrificed at weaning of the pups, at 13 to 15 weeks of age. The weight of the F1 pups (male s and females combined) was reduced compared to controls through lactation on a per litter basis in the 30 mg/kg/day group. During the post -weaning period, signs of toxicity in the F1 males included increased incidence of annular constriction of the tail at all doses (significant at 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day ), significa nt increases in the number of emaciated pups at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and significantly increased urine -stained fur, decreased motor activity, and abdominal distention at 30 mg/kg/day. Deaths were significantly increased in the 30 mg/kg/day males during the post -weaning period. Sexual maturation, as indicated by day of preputial separation, was significantly delayed in the high dose group (52.2 days) compared to controls (48.5 days). No effects were observed on mating, fertility, or sperm parameters in the F1 males. There was a significant dose -related reduction in body weight gain at all doses (1 mg/kg/day and above) during the post -weaning period, although relative food consumption was significantly increased. At sacrifice (day 113 of dosing), body w eights were reduced by 6, 6, 11, and 22% in the 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day groups compared to controls. Absolute and relative liver weights were increased at all doses, and hepatocellular hypertrophy and necrosis were seen in livers of some animals in the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day groups. Kidney weight relative to body and brain weight was increased in all treated groups, but histopathological examination was not performed. Hypertrophy and vacuolation of the adrenal cortex was seen in 70% of high dose anim als, but not in other groups. In F1 females, there was a significant increase (6/60) in mortality in the high dose group 2- 8 days post-weaning. Sexual maturation, as indicated by day of vaginal opening, was significantly delayed in the 30 mg/kg/day group, from 34.9 days in controls to 36.6 days in treated females. Significant reductions in body weight were seen at several time points during post -weaning, gestation, and lactation, although relative food intake was not decreased and body weight was not decreased at terminal sacrifice. No effects were seen in F1 females on mating or fertility parameters, or number of implantations, number of stillborn pups, or length of gestation. The F2 pups were followed until weaning at PND 22. In the F2 generation, no treatment -related effects were seen on pup viability until weaning, percentage of male pups, litter size, average pup body weight on days 1, 5, 8, 15, or 22, or anogenital distance. Because these pups were sacrificed at weaning, post -weaning effects were not assessed. 142 Several LOAELs and NOAELs were identified in this study for males and females at different life stages , and the serum PFOA levels at these were modeled (USEPA, 2005a ). The LOAEL for adult males in this study was 1 mg/kg/day ( modeled serum concentration - 42,000 ng/ml) with no NOAEL identified, based on increased liver weight in the F0 and F1 generations and decreased body weight in the F1 generation. For pregnant females, the LOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day, based on decre ased body weight in F1 pups during post -weaning, and the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day ( modeled serum concentration - 3500 ng/ml). For the male rat pups during post -weaning, the LOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day (modeled serum concentration - 8400 ng/ml at week 4), based on decreased body weight in the F1 generation. For the female rat pups during post -weaning, the LOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day and the mg/kg/day ( modeled serum concentration -13,000 ng/ml) at week 7, based on decreased body weight in the F1 generation. Thyroid effects Effects of PFOA on the thyroid in animal toxicology studies are of interest because there have been many human epidemiological studies of PFOA and thyroid hormones and/or thyroid disease. However, only a few toxicology studies have evaluated effects of PFOA on thyroid function. In the 4 -week study of male cynomolgus monkeys (Thomford et al., 2001a), there were no effects on thyroid hormones (thyroid stimula ting hormone, TSH; total and free triiodothyronine, T3; total and free thyroxin, T4) after 29 days of exposure to 0, 2, or 20 mg/kg/day APFO. It should be noted that the number of animals per dose group in this study was very small (controls, n=2; treated , n=3). Changes in thyroid hormones were observed in PFOA -treated male cynomolgus monkeys in the 6-month study (Butenhoff et al., 2002). This study is described in detail above. At the beginning of the study, there were 6 monkeys in the control and high dose group, and 4 in the other two groups. Some animals in the treated groups did not complete the study because of mortality or overt toxicity (3 mg/kg/day, n=3; 30/20 mg/kg/day, n=2 at end of study.) Thyroid hormones (total and free triiodothyronine, T3; total and free thyroxin, T4) and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) were measured before dosing, and after 5, 10, 14, and 27 weeks of dosing with 0, 3, 10, 30/20 mg/kg/day APFO. Interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that comparisons for t hese parameters are made both to the pretreatment values for the same animals and to the control animals at the concurrent time point. Statistically significant changes were reported for all hormones at one or more time points in one or more dosed groups. TSH was significantly increased at week 35 compared to pretreatment values at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. Total T4 was significantly decreased compared to concurrent controls in all dosed groups (3, 10, and 30/20 mg/kg/day) at week 35, at all time points during treatment (weeks 5 to 35) at 10 mg/kg/day, and at week 10 and week 35 at 30/20 mg/kg/day. Free T4 was significantly lower than in concurrent controls at 10 mg/kg/day at weeks 5, 10, and 27, and at 30/20 1 43 mg/kg/day at weeks 5 and 27. Total T3 was signific antly increased compared to pretreatment values at two time points (weeks 10 and 14) at 3 mg/kg/day, and was decreased compared to concurrent controls in all dosed groups at 30/20 mg/kg/day; this change was not significant at 10 weeks. Finally, free T3 wa s significantly decreased compared to concurrent controls in the 30/20 mg/kg/day group at weeks 5, 10, and 35. T he authors reported that all thyroid hormone values were within normal range, and that no relevant histological observations were observed. T hey also state that there were no relevant changes in TSH or T4, despite the changes in levels of these hormones noted above. It is stated, in the 3 high dose monkeys that were removed from the study due to toxicity, the decreased T3 observed during treat ment trended upward after treatment ceased. The authors state that the observed changes in thyroid hormone levels were likely due to stress or normal variation rather than a direct effect of APFO (PFOA). T hyroid hormones (total T4, free T4, and total T 3) were measured in male Sprague- Dawley rats one day after dosing for 1, 3, or 5 days with a high dose (20 mg/kg/day) of PFOA (Martin et al., 2007). Levels of free and total T4 in PFOA treated animals were significantly reduced to several fold below contr ol levels at all three time points. Total T3 was also significantly decreased at all three time points, although the magnitude of the decreases was smaller than for T4. The effects were similar or greater than those caused by PFOS at 10 mg/kg/day in the same study. Unfortunately, thyroid hormones have not been evaluated in longer term, lower dose rodent studies of PFOA. Neurobehavioral and Central Nervous System Effects Several studies have found neurobehavioral effects, particularly increased activity, in rodents exposed to low doses of PFOA during development. Although human studies on these effects are not reviewed in this document, toxicological studies of neurobehavioral effects are of interest because some human studies have reported associations of PFOA and other PFCs with behavioral effects, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in children (Hoffman et al., 2010; Ode et al., 2014). J ohannson et al. (2008) found significant behavioral effects in adult male NMRI mice given a singl e gavage dose of 0.58 or 8.7 mg/kg PFOA at 10 days of age. Behavioral tests were conducted at 2 and 4 months of age. These behavioral tests included spontaneous behavior (locomotion, rearing, total activity) over three consecutive 20- minute time periods (an indicator of habituation over time) , nicotine-induced motor activity (locomotion, rearing, total activity), and behavior in an elevated plus-maze (a measure of anxiety). These single doses of PFOA did not affect weight gain or cause any overt signs of toxicity. At 2 and 4 months, some or all measures of spontaneous behavior were affected in both the low and high dose groups, with greater effects in the high dose group (8.7 mg/kg) and at the later time point (4 months). Habituation was greatly decreased at both 2 and 4 months in the high dose group compared to 144 controls. This effect increased with age of the treated mice. Lack of effect in the elevated plus - maze test indicated that these effects were not likely to be caused by anxiety. Responses over three 20 minute periods following an injection of 80 \u00b5g/kg nicotine, a measure of the susceptibility of the cholinergic system, was also significantly altered in high and low dose mice at 4 months. Control mice showed an increase in activity from the nicotine, followed by a decrease to baseline behavior. Low dose mice also showed increased activity after receiving nicotine, but less so than controls, and this increased activity was followed by greater activity than in controls during the last 20-minute time period. In contrast, high dose mice showed decreased activity during the first 20 minutes after receiving nicotine but were hyperactive during the later time period. The authors concluded that neonatal PFOA exposure caused deranged sponta neous behavior such as lack of habituation and hyperactivity that worsened with age in adult mice, and that PFOA exposure also affected the cholinergic system. Significant effects were seen at both doses in this study. Therefore, t he LOAEL was 0.58 mg/ kg, and no NOAEL was identified. Serum levels were not measured in this study and have not been measured in neonatal mice administered a single dose of PFOA. A single oral dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg to adult CD -1 mice resulted in maximum serum concentrations of about 10,000 and 100,000 ng/ml (Lou et al., 2009). From these data, the serum concentrations from 0.58 and 8.7 mg/kg can be estimated as 5800 and 87,000 ng/ml, assuming that kinetics in these neonatal mice are similar to in adult mice. The authors st ated that the effects caused by PFOA in this study are similar to those seen with PCBs and PBDEs, known developmental neurotoxicants, and that PFOA should be classified as a developmental neurotoxicant along with these other persistent chemicals. It is noted that studies from this laboratory using the same dosing protocol (a single dose given to 10 day old mice) and the same behavioral tests are the basis for the chronic USEPA IRIS Reference Doses developed in 2008 for two PBDEs, -tetrabromodiphen 2008b,c ). Because the effects persisted into adulthood and were permanent, these effects were regarded by USEPA IRIS as chronic, not acute, even though only a single dose was given. A second study in this laboratory (Johansson et al., 2009) examined the effects of a single gavage dose of 8.7 mg/kg PFOA to 10 day old mice on proteins important for neuronal growth and synaptogenesis in the developing brain. The mice were sacrificed 24 hours after dosing. Rapid brain development, the \"brain growth spurt,\" occurs in mice during this time period. Levels of two proteins known to be involved with neuronal survival, growth, synaptogenesis, and other aspects of neuronal development were significantly increased in the hippocampus but not the cerebral cortex of treated mice, and two other proteins were increased in both areas of the brain. PBDEs, which are known to affect behavior after developmental exposures, had previously been found by these researchers to cause similar effects. The authors conclu de that these changes may relate to some of the observations in their earlier behavioral study. 1 45 On ishchenko et al. (2010) found sex- related behavioral changes in offspring of C57Bl/6 mice exposed to 0.3 mg/kg/day PFOA throughout gestation. Liver weights were significantly increased in treated pups that were sacrificed at birth. PFOA exposure did not affect locomotor behavior in 5- 8 week old mice tested individually, but significant sex -related effects were seen on circadian activity when these mice were housed in social groups. Initially, PFOA treated males were more active than controls, while treated females were less active than controls. After habituation, activity in both light and dark phases was increased during the remainder of the first 24 hours in exposed males, while no effects were seen in exposed females. During the second 24-hour period when the mice were more adapted to the test environment, the number of inactiveperiods during the light phase was decreased in both male and female PFOA -treated mice, and also in the dark phase in PFOA- treated males. No effects of PFOA were seen in other tests, including the elevated plus- maze test for anxiety -like behavior, the forced swimming test for depression-like behavior, or muscle strength in the ha nging wire test. S erum PFOA levels in this study were not measured, but they are not expected to be below the serum levels at the LOAELsand NOAELs in some other studies which evaluated other effects. The NOAEL for these effects is not known. F inally, Sobolewski et al. (2014) studied behavioral effects of developmental exposures to PFOA in C57Bl/6 mice. Three other unrelated environmental contaminants and a mixture of all four chemicals were also evaluated; only results for PFOA alone are reported here. PFOA (0.1 mg/kg/day) was administered to dams in puffed wheat cereal on GD7 through weaning. Behavioral effects were evaluated in male and female offspring (one or two per sex per litter) beginning at age 60 days. P FOA treatment caused behavioral effects , which differed between males and females. Locomotor behavior was increased in males treated with PFOA, while no effect was seen in females. Horizontal movement and ambulatory movements were increased and resting time was decreased during one or more of three test sessions, while vertical activity was unaffected in males. Behaviors related to novel object exploration and recognition were altered in both PFOA- treated males and females to a highly significant degree, although the specific parameters affected differed between sexes. Fixed interval reinforcement schedule -controlled behavior was not affected by PFOA treatment in males or females. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity As discussed in the Epidemiology section, PFOA has been associated with increased incidence of kidney and testicular cancer in humans exposed through drinking water, after adjustment for smoking and other relevant factors. The chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of PFOA has been evaluated in two dietary studies in rats. One study (Sibinski et al., 1987; Butenhoff et al., 2012) included male and female rats, while Biegel et al. (2001) studied only males. As such , chronic toxicity and carcinogencity have been studied only in the rat, a species in which PFOA is rapidly excreted by females. Chro nic studies in another species in which PFOA is persistent in both 146 sexes, such as the mouse, would provide important information specific to females . Furthermore, the chronic studies did not assess effects including carcinogenicity which might result from exposures during the critical developmental stages now known to be sensitive periods for PFOA toxicity. Two year chronic/carcinogenicity study in male and female rats Sprague -Dawley rats (30 per sex per group) were dosed with APFO through diets containing 0, 30, or two ( Sibinski , 1987; Butenhoff et al., 2012) . Additional animals (15 per sex) were included in the control and high dose groups for evaluation at sacrifice after one year. From food consumption data, mean APFO doses wer e determined to be 1.3 and 14.2 mg/kg/day in males, and 1.6 and 16.1 mg/kg/day in females, for the 30 and 300 ppm groups, respectively. Body weight gains were decreased in both sexes in the high dose group, with maximum differences between the high dose group and controls of 21% in males at 6 weeks and 11% in females at 92 weeks. Smaller decreases were seen in low dose males, and decreases were not consistently seen in low dose females. Decreases in weight gain were treatment -related, since food consumption on a body weight basis was increased in treated males, by about 13% in the high dose group. Mortality was not increased by APFO treatment, and 2 -year survival rates were 70%, 72% and 88% in males and 50%, 48% and 58% in females in the 0, 30 ppm, and 300 ppm groups, respectively. The incidence of ataxia was increased in female rats treated with PFOA and occurred most frequently in moribund animals. Ataxia occurred in 3%, 18% and 23% of rats in the control, low - and high- dose groups (including animals sacrificed at one year), respectively. Clinical chemistry changes occurred in high and low dose males, but not in females. The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were increased in both low dose and high dose males between 2 and 18 months, but only in the high dose group at 24 months. Albumin was significantly increased in the male low dose group at 3 and 6 months, and until 24 months in the high dose group. Butenhoff et al. (2012) concluded that the elevations in liver enzymes in both high and low dose males may represent \"borderline chronic liver toxicity\". Hematological parameters including red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit were significantly decreased in high and low dose males and females at different time points. In high dose males, these erythrocyte -related hematological parameters were decreased from 3 to 18 months. Additionally, leukocytes were increased in both dose groups of males during the first year. Statistically significant changes included increases in lymphocytes and neutrophils at 3 and 12 months in both dose groups, and in lym phocytes and 6 and 18 months in the low dose group. 147 In females, hematological parameters were significantly changed with equal frequency in the high and low dose groups. At 3 months, red blood cells were decreased in the low dose group and hematocrit was decreased in the high dose group. At 6 months, eryt hrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were decreased only in the low dose group, while at 12 months, these three parameters were decreased only in the high dose group. At the one -year interim sacrifice, statistically significant changes in organ weights in high dose males includ ed increased liver weight and decreased pituitary weight (absolute and relative to body or brain weight), increased kidney weight (only relative to body weight), decreased adrenal and heart weight (absolute and relative to brain wei ght). No organ weight changes were observed in high dose females sacrificed at one year. At the one -year interim sacrifice, histopathological changes in the livers of high dose males included diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy in 12/15 (compared to 0/15 controls); in 13/15 (compared to 7/15 controls); and focal hepatocellular necrosis in 6/15 (compared to 0/15 controls). In high dose females, hepatocellular vacuolation occurred in 11/15 (compared to 5/15 controls). Te sticular tubular atrophy and marked aspermatogenesis was found in 2/15 high dose males but in none of the controls. At the two -year sacrifice, slight non -significant increases in liver weight occurred in all treated groups of males and females . Relative kidney weight was slightly increased in male and female high dose rats, and this change was significant in females. Several non -neoplastic liver lesions were also increased in treated animals at two years. Hepatocellular hypertrophy did not occur in controls but was found in 12% and 80% of the males, and 2% and 16% of the females , in the low and high dose groups, respectively. Hepatic cystoid degeneration occurred in 8%, 14% and 56% of the control, low, and high -dose males. However, hepatocellular necro sis or hepatocellular vacuolation was not increased in treated animals compared to controls, although an increase of focal hepatocellular necrosis in high dose males and hepatocellular vacuolation in high dose females was observed at the one -year sacrifice. Hepatocellular carcinomas were found in the control (6%), low dose (10%), and high dose (2%) males, and occurred in females only in the high dose group (2%). The incidence of hepatic hyperplastic nodules was 6% in high- dose males, and they were not found in the other groups of males. In females, these nodules were found in 2% of the control and high dose animals, but not in the low dose group. Butenhoff et al. (2012) state that diagnostic criteria for these nodules, which represent a regenerative proc ess, have changed since the histopathological evaluation for this study was performed . The US EPA SAB (2006) conclude d that these nodules may have been part of the continuum of proliferative lesions in the liver carcinogenic process . Butenhoff et al. (2012) further conclude that the increased incidence of focal necrosis and vacuolation in treated animals, which was observed at the one year sacrifice but not at the two year sacrifice (because of the higher background incidence of these changes in older rats ), suggest s a progression of lesions 148 \"from hepatocellular hypertrophy to fatty degeneration to necrosis followed by regenerative hyperplasia.\" The incidence of neoplastic lesions of the testes differed significantly between control and treated rats. Ley dig cell adenomas of the testes were found in 0, 4, and 14% of the control, low, and high dose males, respectively, with a significantly increased incidence in the high dose group. Additionally, vascular mineralization of the testes occurred in 0, 6, and 18% of control, low, and high dose males, respectively, and reached statistical significance in the high -dose group. The incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was 22%, 42%, and 48% in the control, low dose, and high dose females, and the increase in t he high dose group was significant. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were present in 15, 31, and 11% of the control, low, and high dose females, respectively. A subsequent Pathology Working Group reevaluation of the mammary gland slides concluded that the incidence of mammary gland proliferative lesions was not increased by PFOA in this study (Hardisty et al., 2010). A statistically significant, dose -related increase in the incidence of ovarian tubular hyperplasia was found in female rats at the tw o-year sacrifice, with incidence of 0%, 14%, and 32% in the control, low, and high dose groups. The authors of the study report stated that the biological significance of this effect was unknown, as there was no evidence of progression to tumors. Slides of the ovaries were later re- evaluated (Mann and Frame, 2004) using more recent pathology criteria. In the reevaluations, no statistically significant increases in hyperplasia (total number), adenomas, or hyperplasia/adenoma combined were seen in treated gro ups compared to controls. Although the size of stromal lesions was increased in the high dose group, the incidence of ovarian adenomas was higher in the controls than in the treated groups. USEPA (2005a ) concluded that \"based on these toxic effects, the high dose selected in this study appears to have reached the Maximum Tolerated Dose. Based on a decrease in body weight gain, increase in liver and kidney weights and toxicity in the hematological and hepatic systems, the LOAEL for male rats is 300 ppm and the NOAEL is 30 ppm. The LOAEL for female rats is 300 ppm based on a decrease in body weight gain and hematologic effects and the NOAEL is 30 ppm.\" However, as noted above, a significant increase in the incidence of ataxia, as well as hematological ef fects equivalent to those in the high dose group, occurred in low dose females in this study. Also, in males in this study, there were significant changes in several clinical chemistry parameters at multiple time points in the low dose group. Thus, statistically significant effects occurred at multiple time points in the low dose males and female in this study. It should be noted that the study authors concluded that the elevation of the three liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, in both dosed groups of males, in conjunction with liver weight changes and histopathology observations, suggested that PFOA affected hepatocytes in both the low dose and the high dose groups of male rats. 149 The serum level in the low dose (1.6 mg/kg/day) females, considered to be the NOAEL by USEPA (2005a ), was estimated at 1800 ng/ml, based on average AUC (USEPA, 2005a ; Post et al., 2009a). The serum levels in the low dose (1.3 mg/kg/day) males were much higher, and can be estimated at 55,000 ng/ml from the kinetic data presented by USEPA (2005a ). Chronic mechanistic study in male rats The second chronic study (Biegel et al., 2001) was designed to investigate the mode of action for testicular tumors observed in male rats in the first chronic study ( Sibinski et al.,1987; Butenhoff et al., 2012) -Dawley rats were given 300 ppm PFOA in the diet (mean dose of 13.6 mg/kg/day) for up to two years. Serum levels at this dose were estimated as 572,000 ng/ml (USEPA, 2005a ). Two controls groups were used, an ad libitum fed (AL) group and a pair -fed (PF) group in which the food intake was controlled to match the food intake of the PFOA exposed group. Another group of rats was treated with Wyeth 14,643 (WY), a model pe roxisome proliferator. There were 156 rats in each of the control and dosed groups. At interim time points of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months, the liver and testes from six rats per treatment group were weighed and evaluated for cell proliferation. At each time point, peroxisome proliferation (PCO) was evaluated in 6 additional rats per group, and serum hormone levels (estradiol, testosterone, LH, FSH, and prolactin) were me asured in 10 rats from each group. Liver -to-body weight ratios were increased in PFOA treated animals at all time points compared to controls. This increase was greatest at the earliest time point (1 month) and decreased over time. At 24 months, there was only a slight difference in liver -to-body weight ratio between the treated and control animals. Similarly, the increase in peroxisomal beta -oxidation (PCO), a measure of peroxisome proliferation, in the liver was greatest at 1 month, and the magnitude of the increase over controls decreased with time. WY also increased liver weight and peroxisomal beta- oxidation (PCO). Liver cell proliferation was increased by WY but not by PFOA. In contrast to the liver, relative organ weight, PCO activity , and cel l proliferation in testes were not affected in PFOA or WY treated rats except for increased relative testicular weight at 18 and 24 months in PFOA treated animals and at 24 months in WY treated animals. In the pancreas, PFOA increased acinar cell prolifer ation at 12, 16, 18, and 21 months, while WY did not have this effect. Estradiol levels were significantly increased by PFOA at the 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12- month time points. WY also increased serum estradiol. Testosterone, prolactin, LH, and FSH were not changed compared to pair -fed controls. In this study, there was a significant increase of three types of tumors (Leydig cell adenomas, hepatic adenomas, and pancreatic acinar the group at the 24- month sacrifice. The inciden ce of these tumors in the ad libitum control (AL) , pair fed control 1 50 (PF), and treated groups was: Leydig cell adenomas PF- 1/79, treated - 7/76). These same three types of tumors also occurred at a higher rate in the WY treated animals. As discussed above, the incidence of testicular Leydig cell adenomas was also increased by PFOA in a dose- related fashion in the first chronic study (Sibinski et al., 1987; Butenhoff et al., 2012). Information relevant to carcinogenicity from developmental exposure Carcinogenicity studies using prenatal or perinatal exposure protocols have not been reported for PFOA. Very limited information is available that is relevant to carcinogenicity after developmental exposure to PFOA. A s discussed in the section on hepatic effects above, Filgo et al. ( 2015 ) evaluated hepatic histopathological effects , including tumor incidence, at age 18 months in female offspring of dams dosed on GD 1-17. The study evaluated three strains of mice - CD -1, 129/Sv wild type, and 129/Sv PPAR-alpha knockout. CD-1 dams were dosed with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day, and 129/Sv wild type and PPAR-alpha null dams dosed with 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day. The authors emphasize that the study was not designed or intended to be a carcinogenicity bioassay. Rather, t he incidence of liver tumors was e valuated by Filgo et al. ( 2015) because of the unexpected finding of liver tumors in some treated animals that died before the scheduled end of the study. In CD -1 mice in this study , single or multiple hepatocellular adenomas were found in one or more animals in each of the treated groups (n=21 to 37 per group) except for at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg/day), but not in controls (n=29). In total, adenomas occurred in 4.9% (7 of 144) treated animals, compared to a historic control incidence of 0.4% in untreated female CD- mice. Hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in two treated mice (0.3 and 5 mg/kg/day) but not in controls. I n 129/Sv mice, hepatocellular adenomas did not occur in control or treated groups (n=6 to 10 per group). In PPAR-alpha null mice of this strain, in contrast, there were no adenomas in the controls (n=6), one adenoma in the 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg/day groups (n=9 or 10), and two adenomas at 3 mg/kg/day (n=9). These tumors occurred in 13.2% of all treated PPAR-alpha null mice. P ossibly because of the small numbers of animals per dose-group, tumor incidences were not significantly increased in PFOA -treated groups compared to control in this study, with the exception of the CD-1 mice dosed with 0.3 mg/kg/day in which adenomas were found in 4 of 26 animals. The results of this study are suggestive of the potential for developmental exposures to PFOA to cause tumors in mice later in life, and also suggest that these tumors may occur through a PPAR -alpha independent pathway. An additional study with larger numbers of animals and designed to detect increased tumor incidence is needed to further evaluate these questions. 1 51 Ngo et al. (2014) evaluated the incidence of intestinal tumors and other endpoints in wild type and Min/+ C57Bl/6 mice offspring of dams dosed with 0.01, 0.1, and 3 mg/k g/day PFOA during gestation. The Min/+ strain has a mutation of a tumor suppressor related to intestinal adenomatous polyps and is a sensitive model for chemical- induced intestinal tumorigenesis. PFOA did not cause increased intestinal tumorigenesis at s acrifice at age 11 weeks in either wild type or Min/+ mice. Discussion Leydig cell testicular tumors were the only tumo r type that were increased by PFOA in the chronic study of Butenhoff et al. (2012), and the incidence of these tumors was also increased by PFOA in Biegel et al. (2001). In Biegel et al. (2010), the incidence of hepatic and pancreatic tumors was also increased to a similar degree as testicular tumors in male rats treated with PFOA. A lthough hepatic tumors were not significantly increased in treated animals in Butenhoff et al. (2012), both the USEPA SAB (2006) and Butenhoff et al. (2012) point out that the incidence of hepatic hyperplastic nodules was increased in the high dose males in comparison to the control and low dose groups in this study. Butenhoff et al. (2012) state that diagnostic criteria for these nodules, which represent a regenerative process, have changed since the histopathological evaluation for this study was performed. The EPA SAB (2006) concluded that these nodules may have been part of the continuum of proliferative lesions in the liver carcinogenic process, and Butenhoff et al. (2012) further conclude that the increased incidence of focal necrosis and vacuolation found at the one year sacrifice but not at t he two year sacrifice (because of the higher background incidence of these changes in older rats) suggests a progression of lesions \"from hepatocellular hypertrophy to fatty degeneration to necrosis followed by regenerative hyperplasia.\" I n regard to pancreatic tumors , Frame and McConnell (2003) reevaluated the slides of the pancreas from both studies and found that different diagnostic criteria and nomenclature were used by the pathologists in Sibinski et al. (1987) and Biegel et al. (2001). Frame an d McConnell (2003) concluded that the incidence of pancreatic focal acinar lesions , which can progress to adenomas , was increased by 300 ppm PFOA in the diet in both studies and that these lesions were larger, more frequent, and had a greater tendency to progress to adenomas in Biegel et al. (2001). PFOA has been shown to promote liver carcinogenesis in rats initiated with diethylnitrosamine as well as with a more complex initiating protocol (Abdellatif et al.,1991; Nilsson et al., 1991). PFOA also promoted hepatocarcinogenicity in rainbow trout, a model species for human liver cancer (discussed in Mode of Action section, below). A n increased incidence of liver tumors from prenatal exposure to PFOA in CD-1 and PPAR- alpha null mice is suggested by the res ults of Filgo et al. (2015). However, this study is not definitive, and additional research on carcinogenicity later in life after developmental exposures to PFOA is needed. 152 Information related to the mode of action for carcinogenicity is discussed in the Mode of Action section below. Summary of Conclusions of Toxicology Studies The Subcommittee's review of the toxicology data identified increased relative liver weight and delayed mammary gland development from developmental (perinatal) exposure as the m ost sensitive systemic toxicological endpoints with data appropriate for dose -response modeling. Delayed mammary gland development in mice is the most sensitive systemic endpoint with data appropriate for dose -response modeling. I ncreased liver weight is a more sensitive endpoint than most other systemic effects, and it co -occurs with and/or progress es to more severe hepatic effects including increased serum liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, fatty liver, and/or hyperplastic nodules . PFOA also ca uses other types of toxicity including reproductive effects in both males and females, delayed growth and development, immune system toxicity, and neurobehavioral effects. PFOA caused tumors in two chronic rat studies , and one of the se studies provides dat a for testicular tumors that is appropriate for dose -response modeling. All of these toxicological effects are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment, as discussed in the Mode of Action section . 153 Table 10.

LOAEL is defined as the lowest dose with statistically significant effects observed (p 0.05) compared to control. For some studie s, there were dose- related trends that included non- statistically significant changes at lower doses. In some studies, not all dose groups were evaluated for some endpoints. For some studies, not all endpoints evaluated are listed. Several studies that focused on other specific endpoints also evaluated reproductive and/or developmental endpoints but did not present data for these endpoints in usable form, or did not provide statistical significance. These studies are mentioned in the text but are not included in this table. Serum data are useful for dose -response modeling only when measured at end of dosing period. Serum data in many studies were from later time points; these data provide useful pharmacokinetic information but are not appropriate for dose -response modeling. ** See Table 14 and individual study tables in Appendix 5 for more details on studies in which mammary gland development was evaluated. *** Effect occurred at low, but not high, doses. **** In restricted exposure studies, gestational exposure was to the same dose for varying periods of time.

Summary of publications/studies evaluating effects of PFOA on mammary gland (MG) development in mice - Studies with peripubertal exposure (3 publications) ) 1 80 MODE OF ACTION Overview The mode(s) of action of PFOA are not fully characterized. PFOA structurally resembles a free fatty acid, and it thus may act similarly to a free fatty acid in activating nuclear receptors, binding to transporters and carrier proteins, and interacting with membranes (Butenhoff, 2009). However, it is non- reactive and therefore is not a substrate for biochemical reactions involving fatty acids. It also has been shown to have estrogenic activity and to act through other mechanisms. The mode of action for some of the effects of PFOA is unknown. A summary of information on PFOA's mode of action, with emphasis on potential human relevance, is presented below. Genotoxicity Since PFOA is not chemically reactive, it is not metabolized to reactive intermediates and does not covalently bind to nucleic acids and proteins. Therefore, it is considered unlikely to be genotoxic. Information on the genotoxicity of PFOA was reviewed by Butenhoff et al., (2014). PFOA was not mutagenic or genotoxic in most of a series of in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells, with or without metabolic activation. It did not cause chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations, although some positive results were reported at cytotoxic concentrations. It did not cause chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in whole blood with or without metabolic activation, and it did not transform cells in culture. Although PFOA caused DNA strand breaks and increased the incidence of micronuclei in cultured human hepatoma cells in a dose-related manner (Yao and Zhong, 2005), high doses of PFOA did not induce micronuclei in mice in vivo . In male rats, PFOA increased the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in liver DNA, but not in kidney DNA (Takagi et al., 1991). These effects were accompanied by a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, which the investigators suggested caused theDNA damage. In contrast, PFOA increased the formation of reactive oxygen species but was not genotoxic in in vitro studies by other investigators. PPAR -alpha and Other Nuclear Receptors PFOA activates the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor -alpha (PPAR - alpha) as well as other nuclear receptors including PPAR-gamma, CAR (constitutive activated receptor), PXR (pregnane X receptor) and estrogen receptor -alpha (reviewed by Peters and Gonzalez, 2011). When activated, nuclear receptors bind to DNA and alter the expression of genes that control many biological processes involved in development, homeostasis, and metabolism. PPAR-alpha and other nuclear receptors are fou nd at varying levels in many tissues in rodents, humans, and other species. PPARs affect many biological processes beyond stimulation of peroxisome proliferation in rodents, the effect for which they were originally named. Levels of PPARs may vary during different stages of development, and their role in development is discussed further below. M uch attention has been focused on the role of PPAR-alpha activation in the toxicity of PFOA and on the potential human relevance of effects that occur through activation of this receptor. The major role of PPAR-alpha is regulation of energy homeostasis . Levels of PPAR -alpha are highest in tissues with high rates of catabolism of fatty acids and peroxisomal activity, including liver, brown adipose tissue, heart, kidney, and intestine. Hepatic effects of PPAR -alpha include increased fatty acid oxidation, increased degradation of 1 81 cholesterol, increased gluconeogenesis, synthesis of ketone bodies, and control of lipoprotein assembly. By increasing oxidation of fatty acids, activation of PPAR- alpha decreases serum triglycerides and serum cholesterol and prevents the accumulation of fat in the liver (Michalik et al., 2006). Consistent with PPAR- alpha's inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation, PPAR- alpha null mice developed fatty livers, which were more severe with a high fat diet, while fatty liver did not occur in wild type mice on either a regular or high fat diet (Abdelmegeed et al., 2011). In addition to its effects on metabolism, activation of PPAR-alpha also de creases inflammatory response. PPAR -alpha activators such as fibrate drugs are used in humans to decrease serum lipids. The anti- inflammatory effects of these drugs may contribute to their actions in preventing atherosclerosis and reducing the incidence o f cardiovascular events (Michalik et al., 2006). I n vitro activation of human and rodent PPAR-alpha by PFOA has been evaluated in several studies of cultured cells transfected with plasmids containing PPAR -alpha from these species . As noted by Vanden He uvel et al. (2006), these in vitro assays measure only the first step in the series of complex steps involved in regulation of gene expression by PPAR -alpha. Therefore, interspecies comparisons based solely on these in vitro data may not necessarily be valid. R elative sensitivities of human and rodent PPAR -alpha to PFOA differed among these studies, and the results do not clearly indicate that human PPAR-alpha is less sensitive than rodent PPAR-alpha in in vitro systems. Maloney and Waxman (1999) reported that somewhat higher concentrations of PFOA were needed to cause maximal activation of human PPAR -alpha as compared to mouse PPAR-alpha. In contrast, Vanden Heuvel et al. (2006) found that mouse and human PPAR-alpha were similarly responsive to PFOA, whi le rat PPAR -alpha was less responsive than mouse or human PPAR -alpha. Two studies from the same laboratory reported differing results on the responsiveness of mouse and human PPAR-alpha to PFOA. In the first study (Wolf et al., 2008), human PPAR- alpha was somewhat less responsive to PFOA than mouse PPAR-alpha. In the second study (Wolf et al., 2012), the dose-response curves for activation by PFOA were identical for mouse and human PPAR -alpha. M any PPAR -alpha activators (e.g. phthalates, trichloroethyle ne, and perchloroethylene) cause liver tumors in rodents. The human relevance of these tumors is subject to debate because of the lower levels and/or differences in intrinsic activity of hepatic PPAR -alpha in humans as compared to rodents (NRC, 2006; Corton, 2010). However, the uncertainty about human relevance does not necessarily apply to PPAR- alpha mediated effects other than liver tumors, as illustrated by the use of fibrate drugs to decrease cholesterol and lipids in humans by activat ion of PPAR-alpha. F urthermore, as discussed in detail below, effects of PFOA clearly occur through both PPAR-alpha independent and PPAR-alpha dependent processes. Therefore, conclusions from studies with pure PPAR- alpha activators such as Wyeth 14,643 (WY) cannot necessarily be extrapolated to PFOA. Hepatic Toxicity As discussed in the Epidemiology section, PFOA is associated with increased serum liver enzymes in human. The studies in non-human primates, standard strains of rats and mice, PPAR-alpha null mice , and humanized PPAR -alpha mice that are summarized below support the conclusion that hepatic effects of PFOA in experimental animals are relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Data from non-human primates 1 82 In the 13- week study in male cynomolgus monkeys (Butenhoff et al., 2002), PFOA increased relative liver weight in a dose-related fashion. Several monkeys that did not complete the study due to overt toxicity exhibited notable increases in liver weight, highly elevated serum liver enzymes, and/or severe hepatic toxicity. S ubcellular biochemical markers were evaluated in the livers of the monkeys that completed the study; animals that had been removed due to toxicity were not included. Hepatic DNA content was decreased b y PFOA (statistically significant at highest dose); a marker of peroxisome proliferation ( palmitoyl CoA oxidation; PCO) was increased in a dose-related manner (2.6- fold and statistically significant at highest 12); and the mitochondrial enzyme , succinate dehydrogenase, was increased although not in a dose related manner (statistically significant at highest dose). Hepatic alkaline phosphatase (a lysosomal marker marker for endoplasmic reticulum) were not affected by PFOA treatment. A lthough no histopathological changes were reported in the livers of the treated monkeys that completed the study, the authors state that the dose- related decrease in hepatic DNA content is indicative of hepatocellular hypertrophy. The dose- related increase in peroxisome proliferating activity (PCO) was similar in magnitude to the increases reported in PFOA treated rats (below), demonstrating that substantial hepatic PPAR -alpha activity occurs in response to PFOA in non-human primates. The authors also state that the increased succinate dehydrogenase activity suggests mitochondrial proliferation, although this possibility was not evaluated by microscopic studies. A s discussed below, data from rats (Perkins et al., 2004) indicate tha t the increase in PCO activity in response to PFOA becomes smaller in magnitude with longer exposure duration, while the increase in relative liver weight remains stable over time. Since PCO data are available only from a single time point (13 weeks) in the monkeys, it is unknown whether they represent the maximum PCO activity in response to PFOA. The USEPA SAB (20 06) stated: \"Because the available data for PFOA in rats and monkeys indicate similar responses in the livers of rodents and primates (increased liver weight and induction of hepatic peroxisomal enzyme activity), about thr ee quarters of the Panel members shared the view that human relevance for liver effects induced by PFOA by a PPAR agonism mode of action cannot be discounted.\" Figure 12. Relative liver weight and relative PCO activity (compared to controls) v ersus serum PFOA concentrations in male cynomolgus monkeys dosed with PFOA for 6 months (Butenhoff et al., 2002). 1 83 Data from a 90-day study of rhesus monkeys (Goldenthal, 1978) also suggest that PFOA caused increased liver weight, although this effect was not statistically significan t likely due to the small number of animals. Data from standard strains of laboratory rodents In a sta ndard strain of laboratory rats, PFOA activated PPAR -alpha, as indicated by increased PCO activity, and also activated other nuclear receptors, CAR and PXR, as indicated by induction of specific cytochrome P450 proteins associated with these receptors (Elcombe et al., 2010). Similarly, PFOA treatment increased gene expression for cytochrome P450 proteins associated with each of these three receptors in wild type mice (Cheng and Klaasen, 2008). L oveless et al. (2006) evaluated the effects of three isomeric forms of PFOA (linear isomers, branched isomers, and mixed linear/branched isomers) on relative liver weight and hepatic PCO activity in standard strains of male rats and mice. As can be seen in Figure 13, increased relative liver weight did not correlat e with hepatic peroxisome proliferation, as indicated by PCO activity. In mice, liver weight increased with administered dose and serum PFOA level, but PCO activity was lower at the highest administered doses and serum levels than at lower doses and serum levels. Additionally, in rats (Figure 14), branched isomers of PFOA were more potent in increasing relative liver weight than linear isomers, but were less potent in increasing PCO activity. These results illustrate the involvement of PPAR -alpha independent processes in the increased relative liver weight caused by PFOA even in standard strains of rodents with normal PPAR-alpha function. 184 Figure 13. Relative liver weight and relative PCO activity (compared to controls) versus serum PFOA concentrations in male mice dosed with linear/branched , linear, or branched PFOA for 14 days (Loveless et al., 2006). * p < 0.05. 1 85 Figure 14. Relative liver weight and relative PCO activity (compared to controls) versus serum PFOA concentrations in male rats dosed with linear/branched, linear, or branched PFOA for 14 days (Loveless et al., 2006). * p < 0.05. D ata from a standard strain of male rats exposed for 4, 7, or 13 weeks (Figure 15) also indicate that PCO activity does not necessarily correlate with the increased liver weight caused by PFOA (Perkins et al., 2004). Although relative PCO activity was much greater at 7 weeks than 4 weeks, and was lower at 13 weeks than at the two earlier time points, the dose -response curve for increased relative liver weight was similar at all three time points. 1 86 Figure 15. Relative liver weight and relative PCO activity (compared to controls) versus serum PFOA concentrations in male rats and mice dosed with PFOA for 4, 7, or 13 weeks (Perkins et al., 2004). A recent study of histopathological change in livers of female CD -1 mouse offspring with developmental exposure to PFOA does not support the involvement of peroxisome proliferation in the observed hepatic toxicity (Quist et al, 2015; described in the Animal Toxicology section). Transmission electron microscope studies of the livers found no evidence that PFOA caused peroxisome proliferation, but rather indicated that it caused mitochondrial proliferation and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. A ctivation of PPAR-alpha inhibits accumulation of fat in the liver. In contrast, PFOA increased the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids in a standard strain of laboratory rats, and the authors noted that these effect are not consistent with the actions of other peroxisome proliferators such as clofibric acid and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (Kawashima et al., 1995). Additionally, PFOA caused a dose- dependent increase in hepatic triglycerides in mice exposed to perilla oil and soybean oil, although there was no effect in mice exposed to fish oil (Kudo and Kawashima, 1997). In more recent studies of standard strains of mice given either af regular or high fat diet, P FOA caused increased triglyceride levels in the liver and decreased relative adipose tissue weight in animals on both diets (Tan et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). Data from wild t ype mice , PPAR -alpha null mice, and humanized PPAR- alpha mice Studies comparing wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice clearly demonstrate that PFOA causes PPAR -alpha independent and PPAR-alpha dependent hepatic effects. Yang et al. (2002) reported that liver weight was 1 87 increased in both wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice trea ted with PFOA (0.02% in the diet) for 7 days, while peroxisomal acyl CoA oxidase (a marker of peroxisome proliferation) was increased only in wild type mice. In contrast, the model PPAR- alpha activator, WY, increased liver weight and peroxisome proliferat ing activity in wild type mice but had no effect in PPAR-alpha null mice. Based on this study, which was the only study of PFOA in wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice available at the time, the USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006) concluded that PPAR- alpha independent modes of action may be important in hepatic effects of PFOA in rodents. Numerous studies that have been published subsequent to the USEPA SAB (2006) review confirm this conclusion and provide additional relevant information. C onsistent with Yang et al. (2002), Wolf et al. (2008) also reported that PFOA (0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days) increased liver weight similarly in both PPAR -alpha null mice and wild type mice, while WY increased liver weight only in wild type mice. Cell proliferatio n and hepatocyte hypertrophy were also increased by PFOA in a dose-related fashion in both wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice. However, the livers of wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice treated with PFOA differed histologically. Increased numbers of peroxis omes were seen in the livers of treated wild type mice, while the livers of PPAR -alpha null mice had no peroxisomes but had numerous vacuoles. G ene profiling studies in wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice treated with PFOA and WY found that PFOA, but not WY, also activates CAR (constitutive activated/androstane receptor), a receptor that is activated by phenobarbital and other compounds, and possibly PXR (pregnane X receptor). Both compounds caused a similar profile of gene changes in wild type mice, inclu ding up-regulation of genes involved with PPAR- alpha activation. However, while there were few gene changes in WY treated PPAR -alpha null mice, gene expression was altered in PFOA -treated PPAR -alpha null mice , including some of the same genes affected by PFOA in the wild type mice (Rosen et al., 2008a). Further study (Rosen et al., 2008b) showed that 85% of the genes altered by PFOA were PPAR -alpha dependent. The PPAR-alpha independent genes included genes involved with lipid homeostasis and xenobiotic metabolism, and many were consistent with activation of CAR. A dditional studies suggest that PPAR- alpha may be protective against some types of hepatic toxicity caused by PFOA. Minata et al. (2010) showed that hepatic or biliary damage occurred in both wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice treated with PFOA, but the profile of toxicity differed greatly between the strains. They investigated the effects of PFOA in wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice given 4.4, 10.8, or 21.6 mg/kg/day for four weeks. Concentr ations of PFOA in serum and liver were similar in wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice, but were much lower in bile of PPAR -alpha null mice than wild type mice , indicating a much lower capacity for transport of PFOA to bile in the null strain. Relative live r weights were similarly increased in both wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice at all doses of PFOA, to about three times the control value. Hepatocyte and bile duct injury was assessed by light and electron microscopy, by levels of serum enzymes, bile acids, and bilirubin, and by biochemical markers. Hepatocyte hypertrophy and elevated liver enzymes occurred in both wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice, but bile duct injury was much more severe in PPAR -alpha null mice. PFOA increased the levels of two infla mmatory cytokines associated with liver injury in PPAR -alpha null, but not wild type , mice. The authors concluded that PPAR-alpha protects against cholestasis and bile duct injury caused by PFOA in mice. They suggested that rodents may, in fact, be less sensitive to PFOA than humans at some doses. 1 88 Finally, the hepatic effects of developmental PFOA exposure in 18-month old offspring of gestationally exposed dams were studied in CD-1, wild type, and PPAR- alpha null mice (Filgo et al., 2015). At this time point long after PFOA has been eliminated from the body, the incidence and/or severity of hepatocellular hypertrophy was increased by prenatal and early life exposure to PFOA in all three strains of mice , and this effect was more pronounced in PPAR- alpha null than wild type mice. Additionally, consistent with Minata et al. (2010), PFOA caused a dose-dependent increase in incidence and severity of bile duct toxicity in PPAR- alpha null, but not wild type, mice. Additional findings from this study related to carcinogenicity of PFOA are discussed below. T hree additional studies evaluated hepatic effects of PFOA in wild type, PPAR-alpha null, and humanized PPAR -alpha (having hepatic expression of human PPAR-alpha) mice of a Sv/129 genetic background (Nakamura et al., 2010; Nagakawa et al., 2011; Albrecht et al., 2013). PFOA caused hepatic toxicity in all three of these mouse strains, including in fetal liver. It should be noted that differences in response in humanized mice are not necessarily indicative of a different response of human PPAR-alpha to PFOA , for reasonse that may include species differences in binding of PFOA to recognition sites on mouse DNA (cognate DNA). PFOA concentrations in liver and serum were measured in only one of these three studies (Albrecht et al., 2013). H epatic effects were studied in male wild type, PPAR -alpha null, and humanized PPAR- alpha mice treated with 0, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg/day PFOA for two weeks (Nakamura et al., 2009). Relative liver weight was not affected at 0.1 mg/kg/day in any strain and was increased at 0.3 mg/kg/day only in wild type mice. Expression (mRNA and protein levels) of five genes that are targets of PPAR -alpha was measured in the three strains. Expression of four of these genes was significantly increased only in the wild type mice, while expression of the fifth gene was significantly increased only in the humanized PPAR- alpha mice. None of the PPAR -alpha target genes were affected by PFOA in the PPAR -alpha null mice. Histopathological examination showed mild hepatocellular hypertrophy in both wild type and humanized PPAR- alpha mice. C ytoplasmic vacuoles indicating lipid accumulation were observed in PPAR -alpha null mice , consistent with those described in this strain by Wolf et al. (2008). I nterpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that PFOA levels in serum and liver were not measured in this study and may vary between strains . Relative liver weight was increased at 0.3 mg/kg/day in wild type mice, but was not increased at t his dose in the other two strains. However, there was no effect in wild type mice at 0.1 mg/kg/day, indicating that 0.3 mg/kg/day i s relatively close to the NOAEL in this strain . In the absence of serum and liver PFOA data, it is not known whether the inc reased liver weight observed at 0.3 mg/kg/day in wild type, but not PPAR-alpha null or humanized PPAR-alpha, strains is due to an intrinsic difference in sensitivity or to toxicokinetic differences. H epatic effects were also evaluated in male wild type, PPAR -alpha null and humanized PPAR- alpha mice treated with 0, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day for six weeks (Nagakawa et al., 2011). The results of this study do not support the conclusion that rodent PPAR-alpha is required for the hepatic toxicity of PFOA. Hepatocyte hypertrophy occurred in both strains with PPAR-alpha activity (wild type and humanized), and activity of the liver enzyme ALT was increased in all three strains including PPAR -alpha null. Single cell hepatocyte necrosis occurred in all three strains, but hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes occurred only in PPAR-alpha null and humanized mice. Macrovesicular steatosis and inflammatory cells were found only in the PPAR -alpha null mice, while microvesicular steatosis occurred in the PPAR -alpha null and humanized strains but not the wild type strain. 1 89 Liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels were increased several fold in the PPAR -alpha null mice, but not in the other strains, while plasma triglycerides were decreased only in the wild type mice. The authors concluded that PPAR -alpha may be important in protecting from hepatic damage caused by PFOA at the doses used in the study. They also concluded that, since hepatic PPAR-alpha may be weaker in its function and present in lower amounts in humans than in mice, humans may be susceptible to hepatic damage from similar doses of PFOA. F inally, hepatic effects of PFOA were evaluated in wild type , PPAR -alpha null and humanized PPAR- alpha mice and their offspring after exposure to 3 mg/kg/day on GD 1-17 (Albrecht et al., 2013 ). Serum and liver PFOA levels were measured in dams and fetuses on GD 18, and in dams and offspring on PND 20. There were large differences in serum and/or liver PFOA concentrations among strains, and these differences were not consistent at the different life stages and time points. Therefore, differences in responses to PFOA among the strains may be due to toxicokinetic differences in addition to, or instead of, intrinsic strain differences in sensitivity to PFOA's effects . I n dams on GD 18, relative liver weight was significantly increased to a similar degree in all three strains. Expression of two target genes for PPAR-alpha was increased by PFOA in both wild type and humanized PPAR -alpha dams, but not PPAR-alpha null dams, although the increase in expression of one of the genes was not significant in the humanized mice. Expression of target genes for CAR and PXR was increased by PFOA in all three strains , with the biggest increase in the humanized PPAR-alpha dams. Minima l to mild hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed by histopathological examination in all three strains , although the morphological features differed among the strains. O n PND 20, relative liver weight remained increased in the wild type dams treated with PFOA, but not in PPAR -alpha null or humanized PPAR-alpha strains. Expression of a gene associated with PPAR- alpha was also increased by PFOA only in wild type dams. Expression of a gene associated with CAR was not affected in any strain, while expression of a gene associated with PXR remained significantly increased in all three strains. Histopathological changes were observed in livers from PFOA- treated dams of all three strains, but were decreased in incidence and severity compared to on GD 18 in wil d type and humanized PPAR- alpha dams. I n fetuses on GD 18, relative liver weight was significantly increased in wild type and humanized PPAR-alpha, but not PPAR-alpha null, mice. Expression of two genes associated with PPAR- alpha was significantly increased in wild type and humanized fetal livers, but not in PPAR-null. The increased expression compared to controls was greater for both genes in the humanized PPAR-alpha fetuses than in the wild type fetuses, and the increase for one of them was about 5 -fold greater in humanized than wild type (humanized PPAR- alpha significantly different from wild type). Fetal expression of a gene associated with CAR was not affected by PFOA in any of the three strains, and expression of a gene associated with PXR was increased only in the humanized PPAR-alpha fetal liver. Histopathological changes consistent with peroxisome proliferation were seen in some wild type mice, while no definitive changes were seen in the other strains. I n offspring on GD 20, relative liver weight and expression of genes associated with PPAR- alpha were increased only in wild type mice. Expression of a gene associated with CAR was increased in all three strains, with the largest increase in the PPAR -null offspring, while expression of a gene associated with PXR was increased in wild type and humanized, with the larger increase in wild type. At this time point, 1 90 histopathological changes in PFOA- treated wild type offspring were similar to those on GD 19, while changes were not clearly evident in livers from the other two strains. T hese results indicate that hepatic effects of PFOA in adult, fetal, and neonatal mice are mediated by human PPAR -alpha and through PPAR-alpha independent pathways, as well as by mouse PPAR-alpha. As noted above, interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that PFOA levels in serum and liver differed among the strains in dams, fetuses, and offspring. For example, serum and liver PFOA levels were lower in humanized dams and offspring than in wild type dams and offspring on PND 20. Therefore, it is unknown whether the greater hepatic effects in wild type than humanized PPAR -alpha mice at this time point are due to an intrinsic difference in sensitivity or to toxicokinetic factors. Serum cholesterol an d lipids As discussed above, activation of PPAR-alpha causes decreased serum cholesterol and triglycerides in both humans and experimental animals, and this is the basis for the use of fibrates as cholesterol-reducing agents in humans. Consistent with othe r PPAR -alpha activators, PFOA decreased serum lipids levels in rodents in a number of studies (e.g. Loveless et al., 2006, and other studies summarized in Rebholz et al., 2016). In contrast, as discussed in the Epidemiology section, serum PFOA has been consistently associated with increased serum cholesterol, suggesting a human versus rodent difference in the effect of PFOA on this endpoint. Two recent studies suggest the possibility that dietary factors, specifically differences in dietary fat content, may contribute to the observed differences in effects of PFOA on serum lipids in rodents versus humans. Male Balb/C mice on a regular diet or a high fat diet were dosed with 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day PFOA for 14 days (Tan et al., 2013). Consistent with earlier mouse studies, both serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides decreased in a dose-related fashion in mice on the regular diet. In cont rast, serum cholesterol and triglycerides were unaffected by PFOA in mice on the high fat diet. Additionally, hepatic toxicity from PFOA was more severe in mice on the high fat diet (discussed in Animal Toxicity section). I n another study, male and female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were fed a high fat diet containing 32% of calories from fat (similar to the mean of 33% calories from fat in the U.S. diet; CDC, 2016) and 0.25% cholesterol for 6 weeks (Rebholz et al., 2016). In both sexes of C57BL/6 mice and male Balb/c mice, plasma cholesterol was significantly increased by PFOA treatment (3.5 ppm in the diet, resulting in a dose of about 0.5 mg/kg/day), while PFOA had no effect on plasma cholesterol in female Balb/C mice. These results contrast with the decr eased serum cholesterol and triglycerides caused by PFOA reported in other studies in which rodents were fed a standard laboratory diet (e.g. containing 13% of calories from fat and 0.02 % cholesterol ; LabDiet, 2016). Interestingly, Minata et al. (2010) a lso observed that cholesterol was increased at the highest PFOA dose , and triglycerides were increased at all doses , in PPAR -alpha null mice. Immune System Toxicity Effects of PFOA on the immune system in humans and experimental animals are discussed in the Epidemiology and Toxicology sections above. Additionally, immunotoxicity of PFOA and other PFCs, including mode of action studies, was reviewed by DeWitt et al. (201 2). PFOA suppressed the immune system in studies of both non-human primates and mice . Effects include decreased absolute and relative spleen and thymus weights, decreased thymocyte and splenocyte counts, decreased immunoglobulin response, and changes in total numbers and/or specific populations of lymphocytes in the spleen, thymus, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. Based 1 91 on the available data, rats are less sensitive than mice to immunotoxic effects of PFOA . Immune system effects were not observed in the two studies of rats; these studi es included doses higher than those which generally caused immune effects in mice. In humans, exposures to PFOA within the general population range have been associated with decreased antibody levels in response to vaccination. Fletcher et al. (2009) als o reported several statistically significant associations between several markers of immune function (decreased IgA , decreased IgE in females only , increased anti -nuclear antibody, decreased C -reactive protein) and serum PFOA levels in communities with drinking water exposure to PFOA in an unpublished C8 Science Panel report. PPAR -alpha dependence of immune effects in rodents and humans Two studies in wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice indicate that PFOA's effects on the immune system in mice occur through both PPAR-alpha dependent and PPAR-alpha independent mechanisms. Yang et al. (2002b) studied PFOA's effects on immune response in wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice given 0.02% PFOA in the diet (resulting in a dose of 30 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Although food intake was similar in the treated wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice, body weight was significantly reduced by PFOA in the wild type mice , but not the null mice, suggesting that weight loss is related to activation of PPAR -alpha, possibly through PFOA's effects on metabolism, rather than to non- specific toxicity. Consistent with studies discussed in the section on hepatic effects (above), liver weights were increased by PFOA similarly in wild type and null mice, but peroxisome proliferation (as measured by PCO oxidation) occurred only in wild type mice, indicating that increased liver weight was not PPAR-alpha dependent. PFOA caused some immune system effects in wild type but not PPAR- alpha null mice, including decreased spleen weight and splenocyte numbers, and reduced splenocyte proliferation in response to mitogens. However, PFOA also caused other effects (reduced thymus weight and thymocyte numbers, and alterations in the distribution of thymocyte subpopulations) in the null mice, although to a lesser degree than in the wild type mice. These findings led the authors to conclude that PFOA's effects on the immune system are due to mechanisms both dependent and independent of PPAR-alpha. D eWitt et al. (2009 a) studied C57 and Sv/129 wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice exposed to 30 mg/kg/day PFOA in drinking water for 15 days to determine the involvement of PPAR-alpha in the immunotoxic effects of PFOA . Sensitivity to PFOA toxicity appeared to differ in the C57 and the Sv/129 mice, regardles s of their PPAR -alpha status, as PFOA treatment decreased body weight, spleen weight, thymus weight, or antibody titer in the C57 wild type mice but did not have these effects in the Sv/129 wild type mice. IgM titer was decreased in both C57 and Sv/129 PPAR-alpha null mice, although this effect did not occur in the wild type Sv/129 mice, suggesting that this effect is not PPAR -alpha dependent. Relative liver weight was similarly increased in all four types of m ice given 30 mg/kg/day PFOA in drinking water for 15 days, indicating that this response was not dependent on strain or PPAR-alpha status. A more recent study suggests that the T -cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) in mice is independent of PPAR -alpha. DeWitt et al. (2016) evaluated the IgM response to immunization with a T- cell dependent antigen (sheep red blood cells : SRBC ) in wild type and PPAR-alpha C57Bl/6 null mice exposed to 0, 7.5, or 30 mg/kg/day PFOA for 15 days. PFOA at 7.5 mg/kg/day did not affect TDAR , and production of sheep red blood cell-specific antigens was inhibited equally in wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice at 30 mg/kg/day. I n the C8 Health Study population, serum PFOA was significantly associated with a strong downward trend with C-reactive protein, a liver protein that is a marker for inflammation ( Fletcher et al. , 2009). Genser et al. (2015) found consistent and significant associations of serum PFOA with decreased C -reactive protein , both 1 92 within each of the six water districts included in the study and on an aggregated basis. They concluded that these within - and between -district associations strengthen the evidence of causality for this effect. Fibrate drugs act through activation of PPAR- alpha to decrease C -reactive protein in humans (Kleemann et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2011). These drugs also cause decreases in other markers of inflammatory response in vivo in humans and animals, and in vitro through PPAR-alpha activation (Kleemann et al., 2003; Budd et al., 2007; Wagner et al., 2011). As i t is well established that PFOA also activates PPAR -alpha, the decrease in C -reactive protein in populations exposed to PFOA through drinking water may have similarly occur red through PPAR-alpha activation. A dditionally, statins are a group of drugs that inhibit HMG- CoA reductase, a hepatic enzyme involved with including PPAR -alpha (Balakumar and Mahadevan, 2012). Two recent studies have reported that these drugs decrease the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in humans (Black et al., 2016; Omer et al., 2016). As above, it is well establis hed that PFOA is an activator of PPAR- alpha, and HMG-CoA reductase activity was reduced by 50% in rats treated with 0.02% PFOA in the diet (22.7 mg/kg/day) for 7 days (Haughom and Spydevold, 1992). Taken together, these observations suggest that the decreased immune response associated with PFOA in humans may also be related to these effects. F inally, an in vitro study in the human promyelocytic cell line THP -1 showed that PPAR-alpha plays a role in the immunotoxicity of PFOA in human cells (Corsini et al., 2011). Incubation of these cells with 100,000 ng/ml PFOA inhibited the lipopolysaccharide- stimulated release of two (TNF -alpha and IL-8) and matrix metallopeptidase -9, a molecule which plays a role in mobilization of inflammatory cells. This inhibition was reversed when PPAR- alpha was silenced by the addition of small interference RNA specific for PPAR -alpha. Role of corticosterone production secondary to stress in immune effects in mice Loveless et al. (2008) studied imm une system and other effects in male CD rats and CD -1 mice given linear APFO by gavage at 0, 0.3, 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day for 29 days. This study evaluated the role of corticosterone in the immunotoxicity of PFOA. Hepatic effects from this study were desc ribed above. I mmunotoxicity caused by PFOA in the mice included decreased relative spleen weight at 1 mg/kg/day and above, and decreased numbers of spleen and thymus cells, decreased thymus weight, thymic depletion/atrophy, granulocytic bone marrow hype rplasia, and decreased anti -SRBC IgM titer at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. The authors stated that the LOAEL for immunotoxic effects was 10 mg/kg/day, based on decreased IgM titers. However, the significant decrease in relative spleen weight at 1 mg/kg/day suggests that the LOAEL may actually have been 1 mg/kg/day. C orticosterone levels were above the normal value of 400 ng/ml in 7 of 10 mice given 10 mg/kg/day PFOA and in 6 of 10 mice given 30 mg/kg/day PFOA , and decreased IgM correlated with increased corticosterone for individual mice (p<0.002). Based on this observation, the authors suggested that the IgM decreases from PFOA were secondary to stress- related increases in corticosterone. I n this study, rats were less sensitive to immunotoxic effects of PFOA than mice, and there were no effects of PFOA on spleen or thymus weight or on antibody production in the rats. Corticosterone le vels were increased 193 above the level con sidered normal (300 ng/ml) in 2 of 10 rats in the 10 mg/kg/day group and 4 of 10 rats in the 30 mg/kg/day group. DeWitt et al. (2009b) further investigated the hypothesis that immune effects of PFOA are secondary t o corticosterone production in response to stress by studying adrenalectomized and sham -operated mice. Female C57BL/6N female mice (adrenalectomized or sham -operated) were dosed with 0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg/day PFOA in drinking water for 10 days. Corticoster one levels were much higher in untreated sham -operated than adrenalectomized mice, and PFOA increased the levels of this hormone in sham -operated, but not adrenalectomized , animals. However, the immunotoxic effects of PFOA were not reduced by adrenalectom y, as SRBC -specific IgM levels were significantly reduced by 7.5 mg/kg/day PFOA in the adrenalectomized, but not sham -operated, mice , and in both groups of mice by 15 mg/kg/day PFOA . These authors concluded that the suppression of IgM synthesis by PFOA wa s not secondary to stress -related corticosterone production. Developmental toxic ity As discussed in the Epidemiology section , a systematic review of relevant epidemiological evidence concluded that there is \"sufficient\" human evidence (the highest stren gth of evidence in the evaluation scheme) that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth in humans (Johnson et al., 2014). The developmental effects of PFOA in mice have PPAR -alpha dependent and independent components (Dewitt et al., 2009; Abbot t et al., 2007) and may involve toxicity to the placenta. Based on the information presented below, developmental effects of PFOA in laboratory animals are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. The USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006) concluded that PPAR -alpha mediated effects of PFOA in human fetuses, neonates , and children are of potential concern because there was minimal information about human levels of PPAR -alpha during these life stages. Subsequent to the USEPA SAB (2006) review, additional relevant information on the role of PPARs in human development became available. It is now known that PPAR -alpha, - beta, and -gamma are expressed in many fetal and adult tissues in rodents and humans. Abbott et al. (2010, 2012) found that PPARs are present in nine human fetal tissues examined (liver, heart, lung, kidney, intestine, stomach, adrenal, spleen, and thymus) from embryonic days 54 to 125. They found that the levels may increase or decrease with age of the fetus, or bet ween the fetus and the adult. In some fetal tissues, PPARs were expressed at levels equivalent to or higher than in adults. Although the role of PPAR -alpha and other PPARs in human and animal development is not well characterized, based on their physiologi cal actions , they are expected to have important roles in reproduction and development (Abbott et al., 2010). For these reasons, it can be assumed that PPAR -alpha mediated effects on development are relevant to humans. In 129S1/SvlmJ wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice dosed with PFOA on GD 1 -17, full litter resorptions and increased pup liver weight caused by PFOA were independent of PPAR -alpha, while PFOA caused postnatal mortality, delayed eye opening, and decreased weight gain in wild type, but not PPA R-alpha null mice (Abbott et al., 2007). More recently, Albrecht et al. (2013) studied effects of gestational exposure of PFO A in wild - type, PPAR -alpha They stated that PFOA decreased pos tnatal survival in wild type mice, but not PPAR -alpha null or humanized PPAR -alpha mice, suggesting that the humanized PPAR -alpha strain is less sensitive to this effect. However, a detailed review of this study, presented in the Animal Toxicology section , suggests that a firm conclusion on this point cannot be made from the data presented. 1 94 I n the lungs and the liver of fetal (GD 18) CD-1 mice exposed during gestation, PFOA primarily affected the expression of genes related to intermediary metabolism an d inflammation, including genes both associated and not associated with PPAR-alpha activation (Rosen et al., 2007). The authors suggested that PFOA tends to shift metabolism in the direction of a fasted animal, consistent with the metabolic changes and obesity in adult mice exposed to PFOA during gestation (Hines et al., 2009). Developmental exposure to PFOA was found to alter the expression pattern of PPAR-alpha, - beta, and -gamma in many tissues in fetal and neonata l CD -1 mice (Abbott et al., 2012). The expression of genes regulated by PPAR s and other nuclear receptors ( CAR and PXR), including genes involved with homeostatic control of lipid and glucose metabolism, was also altered as early as GD14. The authors suggested that these effects on metabo lism could contribute to the neonatal mortality and decreased rate of growth caused by gestational exposure to PFOA. W olf et al. (2010) discussed the potential human relevance of developmental effects of PFNA that are mediated by PPAR -alpha in mice , and t hese comments are applicable to PFOA as well. They state: \"Relevance of the PPAR -alpha mechanism to humans has been criticized primarily based on the lower number of these receptors in the liver of human versus mouse. However, PPAR- alpha is implicated her e in the developmental effects of PFNA as well, and the etiology of PPAR-alpha in other tissues of the embryo, fetus and neonate of the human and the mouse that are involved in gross development has not been fully determined. Therefore, the possibility of relevance of PPAR -alpha to a human response to PFNA cannot be dismissed.\" A lthough many of the developmental effects of PFOA appear to be PPAR-alpha dependent, PFOA's developmental effects are not shared by other potent PPAR- alpha activators. Palkar et al. (2010) evaluated the developmental effects of two well -studied PPAR-alpha activating compounds, WY and clofibrate, in wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice. Pregnant mice were given doses of WY and clofibrate known to cause the same increase in maternal liver weight that is produced by doses of PFOA that also cause developmental toxicity. As expected, both WY and clofibrate caused increased maternal relative liver weight on GD 18 in wild type, but not PPAR-alpha null, mice. However, WY did not increase fetal liver weight on GD 18, although PFOA caused this effect on GD 18 and/or at early postnatal time points (GD 1, GD 4) in other studies (Albrecht et al., 2013; Macon et al., 2011; White et al., 2009). Although WY did not increase fetal liver weight, both WY and clofibrate increased expression of two genes associated with PPAR -alpha in fetal and maternal liver of wild type mi ce on GD 18. Furthermore, unlike PFOA, which is considered a low affinity PPAR-alpha agonist, the two higher affinity PPAR-alpha activators, WY and clofibrate, had no effect on reproductive and developmental parameters such as litter loss, number of live pups, fetal growth, day of eye opening, or post- natal mortality in either wild type or PPAR -alpha null mice. Although the reasons for these differences between PFOA and the two higher affinity PPAR-alpha activators is not known, these results suggest that PFOA may cause increased fetal liver weight, and reproductive and developmental effects, through a mechanism unrelated to PPAR- alpha activation. To xicity to the placenta may play a role in developmental effects of PFOA such as fetal growth retardation (S uh et al., 2011). In pregnant CD-1 mice treated with PFOA (2, 10, or 25 mg/kg/day) on GD 11-16, fetal and placental weights were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. PFOA also increased resorptions and dead fetuses, and decreased the number of live fetu ses, resulting in significant increases in post- implantation loss. 1 95 Placental efficiency (ratio of fetal weight to placental weight) showed a dose- dependent decrease. Necrotic changes occurred in the placenta at the two higher doses, and decreases in several types of placental trophoblast cells occurred at all doses. These placental trophoblast cells produce prolactin family hormones that are vital to placental and fetal growth, adaptation to physiological stressors, and maintenance of pregnancy. Placent al mRNA for these hormones was significantly decreased in all dose groups. Additionally, mRNA for the pituitary -specific transcription factor (Pit-1) that activate s the prolactin family genes was also decreased. The authors concluded that reduced placent al efficiency due to effects on placental trophoblast cells and placental hormones may play a role in PFOA's reproductive and developmental effects. Male reproductive effects As discussed above, PFOA caused toxicity to the male reproductive system in several mouse studies. Additionally, PFCs have also been associated with adverse effects on sperm parameters and/or effects on male reproductive hormones in humans, although these associations are not necessarily specific to PFOA (Joensen et al., 2009; Toft et al., 2012). Additionally, prenatal exposure to PFOA was associated with decreased sperm count and concentration and increased LH and FSH in young men (Vested et al., 2013). L i et al. (2011) suggest that PPAR- alpha plays a role in male reproductive effects of PFOA and that these effects occur through activation of either mouse or humanized PPAR- alpha. Decreased serum testosterone and an increased percentage of abnormal sperm were statistically significant effects in wild type and humanized PPAR -alpha mice, but statistically significant changes in these parameters did not occur in PPAR -alpha null mice. Additionally, abnormal seminiferous tubules with vacuoles or lack of germ c ells were observed in the wild type and humanized PPAR-alpha mice , while no obvious structural changes occurred in the PPAR -alpha null mice. O ther studies suggest that PFOA may decrease levels of enzymes involved with testosterone synthesis (Zhang et al., 2014), disrupt the blood-testis barrier (Lu et al., 2015), and/or affect cellular pathways in the testes leading to increased oxidative stress (Liu et al, 2015). In regard to the latter effect, it was noted by Liu et al. (2015) that the testes are very sensitive to oxidative damage produced by reactive oxygen species, and that oxidative stress is known to be an important cause of male infertility in humans. Effects on mammary gland development Because the developmental patterns of the mammary gland are similar in humans and rodents, rodents are considered to be a good model for studying the effects of environmental contaminants on human mammary gland development (Rudel and Fenton, 2009; Fenton et et al., 2011; Fenton and Birnbaum, 2015; Osborne et al., 2015). PPA R-alpha null mice are viable, healthy, and fertile (Lee et al., 1995), suggesting that PPAR-alpha is not required for mammary gland development (Yang et al., 2006). However, activation of PPAR-alpha was shown to disrupt matern al mammary gland development in mice in two different mouse models (Yang et al., 2006). First, mammary gland development during pregnancy was impaired in transgenic mice with constitutively activated PPAR -alpha. Additionally, mammary gland development was suppressed wild type mice administered the PPAR -alpha activator WY during pregnancy, and this effect was decreased when dosing with 1 96 WY was started later in pregnancy. In contrast, no significant effects on mammary gland development were observed in P PAR -alpha null mice similarly treated with WY during pregnancy. T he role of PPAR-alpha in PFOA's effects on mammary gland development in mice is not known. As discussed in detail above, prenatal and/or neonatal exposures to very low doses of PFOA cause persistent delays in mammary gland development in mice. However, the effects of gestational and/or lactational exposure to PFOA on mammary gland development have not been studied in wild type versus PPAR-alpha null mice. Limited data from two studies of effects of peripubertal exposure to PFOA on mammary gland in wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice (Zhang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012) are insufficient to support a conclusion on this question. I n Zhao et al. (2010), PPAR- alpha null mice were treated with a single dose level of 5 mg/kg/day PFOA, 5 days per week for 4 weeks, starting at age 3 weeks. It was reported that PFOA caused stimulation of mammary gland development in the PPAR-alpha null mice, and, based on this single data point, the authors concluded that PFOA causes PPAR -alpha independent stimulation of mammary gland development. However, numerical data for this effect were not provided, and a similarly treated group of wild type mice was not included for comparison to the PPAR-alpha null mice in the study. A subsequent study (Zhao et al., 2012) reported no effect on mammary gland development in PPAR-alpha null mice from 7.5 mg/kg/day PFOA given 5 days per week for 4 weeks starting at age 3 weeks, while mammary gland development was inhibited in similarly treated wild type mice. However, th e differences seen in the two strains may not have resulted from PPAR- alpha dependence of the effect, but rather from toxicokinetic differences , since the serum levels in the PPAR -alpha null mice (38,000 ng/ml) were much lower than in the wild type mice (93,000 ng/L). Additionally, the serum levels in PPAR -alpha null mice dosed with 5 mg/kg/day where stimulation was reported (28,000 ng/ml; Zhao et al., 2010) were close to the serum levels (38,000 ng/ml) in the same strain given 7.5 mg/kg/day at which no effects were reported. In summary, the stimulation of mammary gland development in PPAR-alpha nul l mice has not been clearly demonstrated . It was reported only in one study using a single dose level without a comparison group of wild type mice, and was not replicated in a second study of PPAR- alpha null mice with similar serum PFOA levels. Estrogenic effects Estrogenic activity and/or increased estrogen levels may be involved in the mode of action of PFOA. As discussed in the Toxicology section , serum estradiol was increased in male Sprague- Dawley rats exposed to 13.6 mg/kg/day APFO in the diet for 1 month to 12 months in a two -year dietary study (Biegel et al., 2001). PFOA was also shown to bind to and/or activate human estrogen receptor- alpha in several in vitro studies (Benninghoff et al., 2011; Kjeldsen and Bonefeld-Jorgensen, 2013; Buhrke et al., 2015). E PFOA levels of the sensitive estrogen -dependent biomarker protein, vitellogenin, and the expression of estrogen receptor- beta in the liv ers of mature male and female rare minnows (Wei et al., 2007). Male fish exposed to PFOA developed oocytes in the testes, and the ovaries of exposed females underwent degeneration. PFOA (a s well as PFNA and perfluorodecanoic acid [PFDA, C10] ), induced vi tellogenin in young rainbow trout, and these PFCs also activated rainbow trout estrogen receptor in vitro (Benninghoff et al, 2011). S tudies in rainbow trout, a species used as a model for human liver carcinogenesis because it is insensitive to peroxisome proliferation, suggest that PFOA promotes liver tumor development through an estrogenic 1 97 mechanism (Tilton et al., 2008; Benninghoff et al., 2012). PFOA and two other peroxisome proliferating compounds (clofibrate and dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) were te sted for tumor promoting activity in rainbow trout which had been initiated with aflatoxin. PFOA and DHEA (Tilton et al., 2008), as well as PFNA and PFDA (Benninghoff et al., 2012), increased the incidence and number of liver tumors and also induced a genomic signature similar to that induced by 17 -beta-estradiol, while clofibrate did not promote liver tumors and did not regulate genes in common with 17- beta-estradiol (Tilton et al., 2008). Carcinogenicity As discussed in the Epidemiology section, PFOA has been associated with testicular and kidney tumors in communities with drinking water exposure after adjustment for smoking and other relevant factors . As discussed in the Toxicology section, PFOA caused hepatic, testicular Leydig cell, and pancreatic acinar cell tumors in chronically exposed male rats (Biegel et al., 2001; Butenhoff et al., 2012). These tumor types are also caused by several other PPAR -alpha activating compounds in male rats (Klaunig et al., 2003). Hepatic tumors Many PPAR -alpha activators cause liver tumors in rodents through a mode of action involving PPAR- alpha activation. These chemicals are not directly genotoxic, and thus cause tumors through a non- genotoxic mechanism. Activation of PPAR- alpha causes a number of effects in the liver, but all of these effects are not necessarily causal for carcinogenesis. As summarized by USEPA (2009 c), peroxisome proliferation and increases in biochemical markers for peroxisome proliferation such as PCO are considered indicative of PPAR-alpha activation, but they are not considered causal events for carcinogenicity since their correlation with carcinogenic potency is poor. As discussed by the USEPA SAB (2006), the key causal events for PPAR- alpha induced liver carcinogenesis are believed to be PPAR -alpha activation, followed by increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis mediated by gene expression changes, leading to clonal expansion of preneoplastic foci and tumor formation (Klaunig et al., 2003; NRC, 2006). However, aside from the initial event (PPAR- alpha activation), the other causal events are not specific to a PPAR -alpha mode of action but rather are also common to other modes of a ction for hepatic carcinogenesis (USEPA, 2006; Klaunig et al., 2012). M uch attention has been focused on the potential human relevance of rodent liver tumors induced by PPAR- alpha activators. There is wide variation among species in the ability of PPAR -alpha activators to cause hepatic peroxisome proliferation and liver tumors, with rats and mice the most sensitive, hamsters intermediate in sensitivity, and humans, monkeys, and guinea pigs least sensitive to these effects. These species differences may be due to lower levels of PPAR-alpha expression in humans than in rodents (NRC, 2006) or to differences in PPAR -alpha structure and function among species (Corton, 2010). Studies of humans exposed to peroxisome proliferating fibrate drugs have not shown increased risk of liver cancer (NRC, 2006), although these studies have limitations that are discussed by Guyton et al. (2009). T he majority of the USEPA SAB (2006) panel believed that the human relevance of the PPAR -alpah mode of action for liver tumors caused by PFOA could not be dismissed. This conclusion was based on data indicating similar responses to PFOA in the livers of rodents and primates (increased liver weight and induction of hepatic peroxisomal enzyme activity , discussed above). Although increased cell proliferation was not found in the monkeys (Butenhoff et al., 2002), the USEPA SAB (2006) noted that this endpoint was only measured after 6 months of exposure in the monkeys but not at an earlier time point during the first 1 -2 weeks of exposure when it would have been more likely to occur, and apoptosis was not evaluated at any time point. The lack of data on 1 98 cell proliferation at an appropriate time point and apoptosis at any time point in the monkeys treated with PFOA precluded analy sis of dose-response concordance between these key events and tumor induction for PFOA as compared to other PPAR-alpha agonists. Subsequent to the USEPA SAB (2006) evaluation, hepatic effects of PFOA were observed in three studies of mice with humanized PPAR- alpha, although chronic studies to evaluate tumor incidence in humanized PPAR- alpha mice have not been conducted (Nakamura et al., 2009; Nagakawa et al., 2011; Albrecht et al., 2013; discussed above). T he USEPA SAB (2006) also noted that the role of hepatic PPAR -alpha in human fetuses, neonates, and children is not known, and that a PPAR- alpha mode of action for hepatic effects could not be ruled out in these age groups. As discussed above, it was subsequently demonstrated that PPARs are present in many huma n fetal tissues, including liver, and that levels of PPARs increase and decrease with age of the fetus, and between the fetus and the adult (Abbott et al., 2010, 2012). Additionally, PFOA caused increased liver weight and expression of genes associated wi th PPAR -alpha in fetal livers from mice with humanized PPAR -alpha (Albrecht et al., 2013). T he USEPA SAB (2006) further concluded that PPAR-alpha activation may not be the sole mode of action for liver tumors caused by PFOA. This conclusion was based on the single study of PFOA in wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice that was available at the time (Yang et al., 2002 b). In this study, PFOA increased liver weight in both wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice, while a model PPAR- alpha activator (WY) increased liver weight in wild type mice but had no effect in PPAR-alpha null mice. Numerous studies published subsequent to the USEPA SAB (2006) review confirm this conclusion and provide additional relevant information. These include several studies demonstrating P PAR -alpha independent hepatic effects of PFOA in standard strains of rodents and PPAR- alpha null mice, as well at the PPAR -alpha independent hepatic tumors, possibly related to estrogenic effects, in rainbow trout exposed to PFOA. The USEPA SAB (2006) also noted that some of the causal events in the PPAR -alpha mode of action for liver tumors had not been demonstrated for PFOA, including increased cell proliferation in the liver at early time points after dosing and/or decreased apoptosis in liver cells. N ewer information relevant to this issue shows that the hepatic effects of PFOA and WY differ, and that increased hepatic cell proliferation caused by PFOA is not totally dependent on PPAR -alpha activation. PFOA caused liver tumor s in a two -year study of male rats (Biegel et al., 2001), but it did not increase hepatic cell proliferation at any of eight time points between one and 21 months after dosing began. In contrast, the PPAR- activating compound WY, which also caused liver tumors in this study, significantly increased hepatic cell proliferation at most of these time points. E lcombe et al. (2010) suggested that the earliest time point evaluated by Biegel et al. (2001), one month after dosing began, may have been too late to observe hepatic cell proliferation in response to PFOA since cell proliferation occurs early in the sequence of events leading to liver tumors. They studied effects of PFOA and WY on hepatic endpoints including nuclear receptor activation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in male rats at earlier time points (one day after the end of dosing for 1, 7, or 28 days). While PFOA acted as an activator of PPAR -alpha, CAR, -alpha increased hepatic cell proliferat ion and decreased apoptosis, and these effects were accompanied by increased hepatic DNA content. PFOA also increased hepatocellular proliferation, but, unlike WY, it did not cause decreased apoptosis or increased liver DNA content. 1 99 R esults from wild t ype and PPAR- alpha null mice demonstrate that PFOA causes hepatic cell proliferation, one of the key causal events for PPAR-alpha dependent liver carcinogenesis, through PPAR-alpha independent pathway(s). PFOA caused a similar or greater dose-dependent increase in hepatic cell proliferation in mice lacking PPAR -alpha as compared to wild type mice, and relative liver weight was also increased to a similar degree in both strains (Wolf et al., 2008). In contrast to PFOA, WY increased cell proliferation and r elative liver weight only in the wild type mice in this study . A carcinogenicity bioassay of PFOA has not been conducted in a standard strain of mice, or in wild type and PPAR -alpha null mice. However, the incidence of liver tumors at age 18 months was evaluated in female CD - 1, 129/Sv wild type, and 129/Sv PPAR-alpha knockout offspring after developmental exposures to PFOA (Filgo et al., 2015). The authors emphasize that the study was not designed or intended to be a carcinogenicity bioassay, but that tumor incidence was assessed because of the unexpected finding of liver tumors in some animals that died before the scheduled end of the study. In CD-1 mice, single or multiple hepatocellular adenomas occurred in one or more animals in each of the treated groups (n=21 to 37 per group; 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day) except for at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg/day), but were not found in controls (n=29). In total, adenomas occurred in 4.9% (7 of 144) treated animals, compared to a historic control in cidence of 0.4% in untreated female CD - mice. Additionally, hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in two treated mice (0.3 and 5 mg/kg/day) but not in controls. I n 129/Sv wild type mice, hepatocellular adenomas did not occur in control or treated groups (n=6 to 10 per group; 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day). In contrast, in PPAR -alpha null mice of this strain, there were no adenomas in the controls (n=6), one adenoma in each of the 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg/day PFOA-treated groups (n=9 or 10), and two adenomas in the 3 mg/kg/day group (n=9). These tumors occurred in 13.2% of all PFOA- treated PPAR -alpha null mice. The results of this study suggest the possibility that developmental exposure to low doses PFOA may cause hepatic tumors later in life through a PPAR-alpha independent mode of action, although more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be made. Testicular Leydig cell and pancreatic acinar cell tumors Modes of action that have been suggested for the non- hepatic tumors caused by PFOA are reviewed in USEPA (2005a) and Klaunig et al. (2012) . Several other PPAR -alpha agonists have been found to induce the same three tumor types (hepatic adenomas, pancreatic acinar cell tumors, PFOA in Sprague- Dawley rats . However, the modes of action for the latter two types of tumors have not been fully characterized, and it has not been shown that they occur through a PPAR- alpha mediated mode of action. T he mode of action for testicular Leydig cell tumor induction by PFOA is unknown. Proposed modes of action include 1) increased serum estradiol through PPAR-alpha mediated induction of hepatic aromatase activity, leading to estradiol-dependent increased production of growth factors inducing the tumors, and 2) inhibition of testosterone biosynthesis leading to an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) , which promotes Leydig cell tumor development (Klaunig et al., 2012). However, for each of these proposed modes of action, data from the chronic mechanistic rat study (Bieg el et al., 2001) do not support one of the key events and the mode of action (Klaunig et al., 2012). 2 00 The key events in the first proposed mode of action above are: Activation of PPAR-alpha in the liver increased hepatic aromatase increased serum and testicular interstitial fluid -alpha testicular Leydig cell proliferation testicular Leydig cell tumors (Klaunig et al., 2012). As discussed by Klaunig et al. (2012), testicular Leydig cell proliferation was not increased by PFOA at numerous time points during the chronic rat study of Biegel et al. (2001). T he key events in the second proposed mode of action above are: Decreased testosterone levels increased LH levels testicular Leydig cell tumors. As discussed by Klaunig et al. (2012), LH was not increased by PFOA at numerous time points during the chronic rat study (Biegel et al., 2001). T he mode of action for pancreatic acinar cell tumor induction by PFOA is also unknown. One possible hypothesis that has been suggested is that these tumors occur as a result of an increase in cholecystokinin secondary to hepatic effects of PFOA, but this has not been demonstrated experimentally (Klaunig et al., 2012). T he USEPA SAB (2006) concluded that insufficient data were available to determine the mode of action for the testicular Leydig cell tumors and the pancreatic acinar cell tumors found in PFOA treated male rats (Biegel et al., 2001). More recently, Klaunig et al. (2012) concluded that , based on information presented above, t he available data do not definitively establish a mode of action for these tumors. In the absence of a defined mode of action for these tumor types, the USEPA SAB (2006) concluded that \"they must be pr esumed to be relevant to humans, as suggested by EPA's Cancer Guidelines,\" and this conclusion remains valid at this time. Other possible modes of action A number of other modes of action for PFOA have been suggested. Although a complete review of this topic is beyond the scope of this document, information on several potential modes of action is summarized below. P FOA and other perfluorinated carboxylates of carbon chain lengths C7-C10 inhibited intercellular gap junction communication in vitro in cul tured rat liver cells, while non -fluorinated fatty acids and PFCs of chain length C2-C5 or C16 and C18 did not (Upham et al., 1998). In further in vivo studies , male F -344 rats fed diets containing 0.02% PFOA (resulting in a dose of 37.9 mg/kg/day) for 7 days had significantly increased liver weight and significantly decreased hepatic gap junction intercellular communication, as measured by the distribution of a fluorescent dye that travels through gap junction channels (Upham et al., 2009). Perfluoropentanoic acid (C5) did not cause either of these effects. The authors suggested that disruption of gap junction intercellular communication can lead to tumorigenesis and can be important in tumor promotion. However, Lau et al. (2007) stated that inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication is a widespread phenomenon, and that these effects of PFOA and other PFCs have not been shown to be species or tissue specific. T he mode of action for PFOA may also involve effects on mitochondria. As discussed above, developmental exposure to PFOA in female mice caused hepatic mitochondrial proliferation and abnormal mitochondrial morphology later in life (Quist et al., 2015). Furthermore, hepatic activity of the mitochondrial enzyme, succinate dehy drogenase, was increased in cynomolgus monkeys treated with PFOA (Butenhoff et al., 2002). 2 01 Hepatic mitochondrial DNA copy number was also significantly increased in male rats 3 days after a single dose of 100 mg/kg PFOA and after 28 days of exposure to 30 mg/kg/day (Berthiaume and Wallace, 2002; Walters et al., 2009). S tarkov and Wallace (2002) investigated effects of PFOA and other PFCs in isolated mitochondria. The involvement of mitochondria in the mode of action of PFCs was suggested by earlier repo rts of proliferation of hepatic mitochondrial membranes after and uncoupling of mitochondrial in isolated mitochondria exposed to high concentrations of PFCs (reviewed in Starkov and Wallace, 2002). They found that PFOA and PFOS c aused slight effects only at high concentrations (e.g. 100 \u00b5M for PFOA) which may have resulted from changes in membrane fluidity due to the surfactant properties of PFCs. In contrast, other PFCs were potent uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, such as perfluorooctane sulfonamide which had an IC 50 of 1 M for this effect. M icroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non -coding RNAs which affect gene expression by binding to complementary mRNA to block translation or trigger degradation. Changes in miRNA may play a role in various diseases by affecting the expression of relevant genes (Wang et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2014). Recent studies suggest that PFOA may alter miRNA levels in both humans and rodents. Elevated levels of specific miRNAs in serum were associated with serum PFOA concentrations in a study of Chinese residents and workers with PFOA exposures from a fluoropolymer manufacturing facility (Wang et al., 2012). In this study, 63 of the 754 miRNAs that were evaluated were detected in all serum samples. L evels of 9 miRNAs were significantly higher in workers compared to less highly exposed residents. In a further analysis, levels of two of these (miR-26b and miR- 199a-3p) were significantly increased in an exposure-related fashion within the worker group. A subsequent study found that levels of circulating miRNAs were increased in male BALB/cJ mice dosed with PFOA for 28 days, and that more miRNAs were affected as PFOA dose increased. Interestingly, the two miRNAs that were associated with PFOA in workers in a dose- related fashion were also increased by PFOA exposure in mice (Yan et al., 2014). I n addition, the mode of action of PFOA may involve effects related to organic anion transporters (OATs), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), and other multispecific transporter proteins such as multidrug resistance -associated proteins (MRPs/Mrps). These highly conserved transporters are present in the membranes of many tissues throughout the body in humans, other mammalian species, and lower vertebrat es. They are responsible for the transport of numerous endogenous and xenobiotic compounds both into and out of cells. Substrates for transporter proteins include fatty acids, hormones, bile acids, drugs, environmental contaminants, and other exogenous and endogenous substances that are critical in homeostatic pathways (Roth et al., 2011). I t is well established that renal tubular secretion and reabsorption of PFOA occur through transport by various OATs and OATPs, and that the slow rate of excretion of PFOA in male (in contrast to female) rats and both genders of humans is due to reabsorption of PFOA by specific renal OATs and/or OATPs (Han et al., 2012). Recent studies have shown that effects of PFOA in organs other than the kidney may involve these transporter proteins as well. PFOA can act as an inhibitor of specific OATs and OATPs (Yang et al., 2009b; 2010), and it induced MRP in cultured human cells (Rusiecka and Skladanowski, 2008) and Mrp in mouse liver (Maher et al., 2008), potentially affecting transport of endogenous substances, drugs, and other transporter substrates. The role of OAT4 in placental transfer of PFOA in humans was recently studied (Kummu et al., 2015). OAT4 is found primarily in human kidney and placenta and has been identif ied as one of the specific transporters 2 02 responsible for renal reabsorption of PFOA in humans (Han et al., 2012). The level of placental OAT4 was inversely correlated with the rate of transfer of PFOA from the maternal circulation to fetal circulation in studies of perfused human placenta, suggesting that higher levels of placental OAT4 may protect the fetus from PFOA after maternal exposure (Kummu et al., 2015). Summar y of conclusions about human relevance of toxicological effects of PFOA Based on the information presented above, the toxicological effects of PFOA are generally considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Hepatic effects Increased serum levels of liver enzymes are associated with exposure to PFOA in humans. Data from non- human primates, standard strains of rats and mice, PPAR -alpha null mice, and humanized PPAR- alpha mice support the conclusion that hepatic effects of PFOA in experimental animals are relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. P FOA caused increased relative liver weight in non -human primates, species for which the human relevance of hepatic effects is not in question. In a subchronic study in cynomolgus monkeys, several animals that did not complete the study due to overt toxicity exhibited notably increased liver weight, highly elevated serum liver enzymes and/or severe hepatic toxicity. In this study, hepatic peroxisome proliferating activity was increased in a dose-related fashion. As was noted by the USEPA SAB (2006), the effects of PFOA on both liver weight and peroxisome proliferation were similar in cynomolgus monkeys and rats. In contrast to rodents, the human relevance of hepatic effects mediated by PPAR -alpha in non-human primates is not subject to debate. Potential PPAR -alpha independent pathways for hepatic effects of PFOA have not been thoroughly investigated in non- human primates, although increased activity of a mitochondrial enzyme ( succinate dehydrogenase) was reported in the subchronic cynomolgus monkey study . Dat a from standard strains of mice and rats clearly show that PPAR-alpha independent mechanisms contribute to the hepatic effects of PFOA . Studies which evaluated both liver weight and hepatic peroxisome proliferating activity provide data relevant to this question. At the doses and time points evaluated in these studies, the dose-response curves for increased liver weight and hepatic peroxisome proliferating activity did not directly correspond. These data indicate that hepatic effects of PFOA involve PPAR -alpha independent mechanisms even in standard strains of rodents with normal PPAR-alpha status. Furthermore, PFOA caused fatty liver in standard strains of mice and rats, although PPAR- alpha activation causes decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. Additio nally, recent studies suggest that the differences in the effects of PFOA on serum lipids in rodents (decreased cholesterol and triglycerides) versus humans (increased cholesterol and triglycerides) may be related to the low fat diet generally used in laboratory rodent studies versus the higher fat content of a typical Westernized human diet, rather than solely to interspecies differences. Finally, developmental exposure to PFOA caused abnormal mitochondria in livers of a standard strain of laboratory mice, with no evidence of peroxisome proliferation. D ata from studies comparing mice with normal PPAR -alpha status (wild type) and mice lacking PPAR -alpha (PPAR -alpha null) provide further evidence that hepatic effects occur through both PPAR-alpha dependent and PPAR -alpha independent pathways. PFOA causes similar increases in liver weight in wild type and PPAR- alpha null mice. PFOA also causes histopathological changes and increased liver enzymes in PPAR-alpha null 2 03 mice; the histopathological changes differ from those seen in wild type mice, particularly as related to damage to the bile duct. Additionally, developmental exposures to PPAR- alpha null mice caused persistent histopathological changes in the liver. D ata from mice expressing human PPAR -alpha in the liver indicate that activation of human PPAR -alpha by PFOA causes hepatic effects. PFOA caused similar increases in liver weight in humanized PPAR -alpha mice and wild type mice. Other hepatic effects of PFOA in humanized PPAR- alpha mice include ation of PPAR -alpha, and histopathological changes including hepatocellular hypertrophy and single cell necrosis. PPA R-alpha is known to be active in human fetal tissues, including liver. Fetal liver weight was increased similarly in wild type and PPAR- alpha humanized mice after in utero exposure. Additionally, PFOA increased the expression of genes associated with PPAR- alpha in fetal liver to a greater degree in PPAR -alpha humanized mice than in wild type mice. Immune system ef fects Data from epidemiological studies suggest that the immune system is a sensitive target for PFOA in humans. PFOA suppresses the immune system in both non-human primates and mice . Data from mouse studies indicate that these effects on the immune syst em occur through both PPAR-alpha dependent and PPAR -alpha independent modes of action. Both PPAR-alpha dependent and independent effects on the immune system are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Potentially relevant to this conclusion, lipid-lowering drugs that activate PPAR -alpha have recently been associated with decreased effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in humans, consistent with inhibition of human immune response by agents that activate PPAR -alpha such as PFOA. Developmental and reproductive effects PFOA is associated with decreased fetal growth in humans. PPAR -alpha and other PPARs are present in human fetal tissues and are expected to have important roles in reproduction and development . Therefore, PPAR -alpha mediated effects of PFOA on development are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Developmental effects of PFOA in rodents appear to occur primarily through PPAR- alpha dependent mechanisms, while some reproductive effects such as full litter resorptions appear to be PPAR- alpha independent. However, high affinity \"pure\" PPAR-alpha activators (WY and clofibrate) do not cause the developmental effects in mice that were caused by PFOA. D elayed mammary gland developm ent after developmental exposure is a sensitive endpoint for PFOA toxicity in mice. The rodent is considered a good model for human mammary gland development, and there is no mode of action evidence suggesting that the effects of PFOA on this endpoint are not relevant to humans. P FOA also causes reproductive toxicity in male mice, and there is no mode of action information to suggest that these effects are not relevant to humans. Carcinogenicity PFOA is associated with testicular and kidney cancer in com munities with drinking water exposure after adjustment for smoking and other relevant factors. PFOA caused tumors of the liver, testicular Leydig cells, 2 04 and pancreatic acinar cells in male rats. USEPA (2006) SAB did not dismiss the potential human releva nce of the liver tumors in rats, based on similarities in hepatic effects of PFOA in monkeys and rodents and the limited evidence available at the time for hepatic effects of PFOA in PPAR -alpha null mice. Subsequent studies have provided substantial additional information showing hepatic effects of PFOA in PPAR -alpha null mice. Importantly, hepatic cell proliferation, a causal event for tumor formation, is increased similarly by PFOA in wild type and PPAR-alpha null mice. Although a carcinogenicity bioassay for PFOA has not been conducted in PPAR -alpha null mice, a recent study suggests that developmental exposures to PFOA may cause hepatic tumors in adulthood in this strain. Finally, studies in rainbow trout, a species used as a model for human liver cancer because it lacks PPAR -alpha, suggest that PFOA causes liver tumors through an estrogenic mode of action. B ecause the modes of action for the testicular and pancreatic tumors caused by PFOA have not been established, these tumors are considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. DEVELO PMENT OF RECOMMENDED HEALTH -BASED MCL Health -based MCLs developed by the DWQI are intended to be pr otective for ch ronic (lifetime) exposure through drinking water. The 1984 Amendments to the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water Act (N.J.S.A. 58:12A- 20) stipulate that Health -based MCLs are to be based on a one in one million lifetime cancer risk level for carcinogens and no adverse effects from lifetime ingestion for non-carcinogens. Consideration of human epidemiological data Both the human epidemiology data and the animal toxicology data were considered as part of the overall weight of evidence for the potential human health effects of PFOA. As reviewed in the Epidemiology section , associations of PFOA with numerous health endpoints have been found in human populations, with evidence supporting multiple criteria for causality for some effects . These health endpoints include non- carcinogenic effects in the general population, and both non- carcinogenic effects and cancer in communities with drinking water exposure. The epidemiologic data for PFOA are notable because of the consistency between results among human epidemiologic studies in different populations, the concordance with toxicological findings in experimental animals, the use of serum concentrations as a measure of internal exposure, the potential clinical importance of the endpoints for which associations are observed, and the observation of associations within the exposure range of the general population and communities with contaminated drinking water . These features of the epidemiologic data distinguish PFOA from most other organic drinking water contaminants and justify concerns about exposures to PFOA through drinking water. A lthough the data for some endpoints support multiple criteria for causality , the human epidemiology data have limitations and are therefore not used as the quantitative basis for the Health -based MC L. Instead, the potential Health -based MCLs developed below are based on sensitive and well established animal toxicology endpoints that are considered relevant to humans based on mode of action data. Notwithstanding, continued exposure to even relatively low levels of PFOA in drinking water are known to cause substantial increases in PFOA in blood serum, to levels several fold higher than those found in the general population. The considerable evidence for increased risks of health effects from the low -level PFOA exposures prevalent in the general population (e.g. <10 ng/ml, NHANES 2007-2010; CDC 2015) and in communities with contaminated drinking water suggests a need for caution about drinking water exposures that will result in such elevations in serum PFOA level. Relevant to this point, it is noted that the German Human Biomonitoring Commission recently developed a 2 05 Human Biomonitoring Level I (the serum level below which adverse health effects are not expected) for PFOA of 2 ng/ml, close to the current median PFOA serum level in the U.S. general population. This HBM I is based on the serum PFOA levels associated with increased time to pregnancy, decreased fetal growth, increased serum cholesterol, and decreased immune response in humans, and with delayed mammary gland development in mice (Apel et al., 2016). The human epidemiological data thus support the use of a public health-protective approach in developing a Health-based MCL recommendation based on animal toxicology data. Weight of Evidence for Carcinogenicity PFOA caused tumors in male rats in two ch ronic studies (Sibinski et al., 1987, Butenhoff et al., 2012; and Biegel et al., 2001). It caused a statistically significant increase in testicular Leydig cell tumors in both studies, as well as a statistically significant increase in liver tumors and pan creatic tumors in Biegel et al. (2001). Human exposure to PFOA has also been associated with increased risk of cancer, including increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer in communities with contaminated drinking water after adjustment for smoking an d other relevant factors (Barry et al, 2013; Vieira et al., 2013). B ased on the chronic animal data and mode of action studies available at the time, PFOA was described as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board (USEPA, 2006). PFOA was classified as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" by IARC based on review of data from human epidemiology, animal toxicology, and mechanism of action studies (Benbrahim-Tallaa et al., 2014). More recently, PFOA was described by the USEPA Office of Water (2016 a) as having \"suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential\", a descriptor similar to the classification of \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" used by IARC (2015). T he USEPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (2005b) recommend dose-response modeling and low dose extrapolation for chemicals described as likely to be carcinogenic. For chemicals with suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, dose-response modeling and low dose extrapolation may be performed when data to support it are available. The guidelines recommend that the risk -based estimates for suggestive carcinogens be used to obtain \"a sense of the magnitude and uncertainty of potential risks, ranking potential hazards, or setting research priorities.\" Risk -based drinking water concentrations based on both non- carcinogenic and carcinogenic endpoints are presented below. Potential Health -based MCLs based on non- carcinogenic endpoints Selection of toxicological endpoints for consideration as basis for potential Health- based MCLs As reviewed in the Toxicology section above, PFOA causes numerous systemic effects in experimental animals. These include liver toxicity, immune system toxicity, adverse developmental effects, and other adverse effects. The Health Effects Subcommittee concluded that delayed mammary gland development and increased relative liver weight are the most sensitive systemic endpoints with data appropriate for dose-response modeling. D elayed mammary gland development from perinatal exposure is the most sensitive systemic endpoint for PFOA with data appropriate for dose-response modeling. It is a well -established toxicological effect of PFOA that is considered to be adverse and relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. An RfD based on this endpoint is presented below. T o the knowledge of the Health Effects Subcommittee, an RfD for delayed mammary gland development has not previously been used as the primary basis for heal th-based drinking water concentrations or other human 2 06 health criteria for environmental contaminants. Because the use of this endpoint as the basis for human health criteria is a currently developing topic , the Health Effects Subcommittee decided not to recommend a Health - based MCL with the RfD for delayed mammary gland development as its primary basis. However, the occurrence of this and other effects at doses far below those that cause increased relative liver weight (the endpoint used as the prima ry basis for the recommended Health -based MCL) clearly requires application of an uncertainty factor to protect for these more sensitive effects . Increased relative liver weight is a well -established effect of PFOA that is more sensitive than most other toxicological effects such as immune system toxicity and most reproductive/developmental effects (Table 1 2 of Animal Toxicology section). A recommended Health -based MCL with increased liver weight as its primary basis is presented below. Selection of studies and data for dose-response modeling Only those studies that provide serum PFOA data were considered for dose-response modeling of non-carcinogenic effects. A risk assessment approach based on m easured serum PFOA levels is less uncertain than one based on pharmacokinetic modeling of estimate d serum PFOA levels or an approach in which interspecies extrapolations is based on interspecies half -life differences. For example, as discussed above, serum PFOA concentrations from the same administered dose vary among strains and even between animals of the same strain obtained from different sources. Available approaches based on pharmacokinetic modeling or interspecies half-life conversions do not account for these intra- strain differences. I n some studies, serum PFOA was measured only at time points well after dosing had ended. Serum data from these later time points are not appropriate for dose-response modeling because PFOA body burdens would have decreased, and the serum levels thus do not represent the maximum exposures during the study. Therefore, only studies which provide serum PFOA levels close to the end of the dosing period were considered for dose- response modeling. Use of the maximum serum levels that occurred during the study is a non-conserva tive approach (i.e. would result in a less stringent, rather than more stringent, risk assessment than other potential approaches such as area under the curve modeling), since the observed toxicological effects could have resulted from the lower average exposures experienced over the entire dosing and post-dosing time periods. B enchmark dose (BMD) modeling is a quantitative approach commonly used to estimate the lower 95% confidence limit (the BMDL) on the dose corresponding to a minimal response (the benchmark response, BMR ) that is consistent with the observed data. The BMDL is considered to be an estimate of the NOAEL, but it is based on the entire dose-response curve for the endpoint of interest rather than just the fixed doses administered in the study . When the necessary data are available, BMD modeling can be performed using serum concentrations instead of administered doses. Serum concentrations are preferable to administered doses as the basis for BMD modeling because they are a better repres entation of the shape of the internal dose response curve. BMD modeling based on serum PFOA data was used to determine BMDLs for serum PFOA concentrations used as the points of departure (PODs) to develop RfDs for both increased relative liver weight and delayed mammary gland development. Reference Dose based on delayed mammary gland development Delayed mammary gland development in mice from developmental exposures is a sensitive endpoint for PFOA's toxicity. This effect has been reported in nine separate studies presented in five publications ( Table 14 2 07 of Toxicology section ). Only one study (Albrecht et al., 2013) , which has several general problematic issues (discussed in Toxicology section ) did not find this effect. Gestational and/or lactational exposures to PFOA caused delayed mammary gland development in pregnant dams and/or female offspring in two strains of mice. In one study, this effect was statistically significant in mouse pups ex posed to concentrations of 5000 ng/L (5 g/L) in drinking water in utero and after birth. The serum PFOA levels (80 ng/ml in the dams and 20-70 ng/ml in the pups) that resulted in delayed mammary gland development in these mice are relevant to human serum PFOA levels from contaminated drinking water. H istological changes in the mammary gland s of exposed offspring persist ed until adulthood and were considered permanent. Delayed mammary gland development occurs in a dose- related fashion , and there is no in formation indicating it is not relevant to humans. For these reasons, delayed mammary gland development from developmental exposures to PFOA is considered a sensitive and relevant endpoint for dose- response modeling . Selection of study and data for dose-response modeling of delayed mammary gland development The late gestational exposure study conducted by Macon et al. (2011) is the only developmental exposure study of mammary gland development that provides serum PFOA data from the end of the dosing period (PND 1) that can be used for dose-response modeling. In this study, pregnant dams were dosed with PFOA (0.01 to 1 mg/kg/day) on GD 10-17. Mammary gland development was assessed on PND 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21, and delays in development were most evident on PND 21. Of the several endpoints related to mammary gland development reported by Macon et al. (2011), two endpoints (decreased mammary gland developmental score and decreased number of terminal end buds) showed a stat istically significant dose -related decrease at PND 21 over the dose range studied. These endpoints were selected for dose-response modeling (Table 15). Table 1 5. Mammary gland development parameters selected for dose -response modeling from PND 21 female offspring after exposure on GD 10-17 (Macon et al., 2011) Dose 1 (ng/ml) Developmental Terminal End Buds Control 22.6 \u00b1 5.5 3.3 \u00b1 0.3 40 \u00b1 4 0.01 284.5 873.5 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 15 \u00b1 2 Determination of Point of Departure for delayed mammary gland development USEPA Benchmark Dose Modeling Software 2.1.2 was used to perform BMD modeling of the data for mammary gland developmental score and number of terminal endbuds at PND 21 from Macon et al. (2011), using serum PFOA data from PND 1 as the dose. Continuous response models were used to obtain the BMD and the BMDL for a 10% change from the mean (the percent change typically used as the BMR ) for the two endpoints. Modeling was based on serum levels at PND 1, since they were higher at this time than at later time points. In this study, the serum level in the control group was 22.6 ng/ml, indicating that some PFOA exposure occurred in these non-dosed animals. The BMD and BMDL values presented in Table 16 were derived using this value from the control group (22.6 ng/ml) as the baseline. The serum level BMDs and BMDLs may have been lower if the baseline serum level had been lower (Post et al., 2012). C ompared to controls, the developmental score at PND 21 significantly decreased at all three doses; the number of terminal end buds also decreased at all three doses, with significance at the two higher doses. Th e BMDLs 2 08 for the two endpoints, 24.9 and 22.9 ng/ml (Table 16), are close to the NOAEL of 28.5 ng/ml that is estimated by applying a standard uncertainty factor of 10 for LOAEL- to-NOAEL extrapolation to the serum level of 285 ng/ml at the LOAEL, 0.01 mg/kg/day. Outputs of the BMD modeling are provided in Appendix 6. Table 16. Benchmark Dose modeling of serum PFOA data (PND1) for mammary gland developmental effects (PND 21) in CD -1 mouse pups (Macon et al., model 3 (logged concs.)0.98 87.90 25.1d 22.9d a Results are shown for all models that gave an acceptable visual fit. b A larger Chi -square p -value indicates a better fit to the data. c AIC: A measure of information loss from a dose -response model that can be used to compare a specified set of models. The AIC is defined as - 2 \u00d7 (LL - p), where LL is the log -likelihood of the model given the data, and p is the number of parameters estimated in the model. When comparing models, a lower AIC is preferable to a higher one (USEPA, 2012a ). d BMDs and BMDLs from the models with the lowest AIC statistic for each endpoint. Application of uncertainty factors for delayed mammary gland development The choice of uncertainty factors is consistent with current USEPA IRIS guidance (USEPA, 2012c) and previous risk assessments developed by NJDEP and the DWQI. T he BMDL for decreased number of terminal endbuds of 22.9 ng/ml in serum ( derived above ) was used as the POD for RfD development. Uncertainty factors (UFs) were applied to the POD to obtain the Target Human Serum Level . The Target Human Serum Level (ng/ml in serum) is analogous to an RfD but is expressed in 2 09 terms of internal dose rather than administered dose. Th e total of the uncertainty factors (UF s) applied to the POD serum level was 30, and included the following factor s: 10 - UF for human variation, to account for variation in susceptibility across the human population and the possibility that the available data may not be representative of individuals who are most sensitive to the effect. 3 - UF for animal -to-human extrapolation, to account for toxicodyna mic differences between humans and mi ce. The typical uncertai nty factor of 3 for toxicokinetic variability between species is not included because the risk assessm ent is based on com parison of internal dose (serum levels) rather than administered dose. 1 - UF for LOAEL to NOAEL . The point of departure is a BMDL, not a LOAEL. Therefore, this uncertainty factor is not applied. 1 - UF for duration of exposure . Delayed mammary gland development occurs from exposures during development. Therefore, an UF to account for effects from longer term exposures is not used. 1 - UF for more sensitive effects that are not considered (e.g. i ncomplete database). Because delayed mammary gland development is a sensitive endpoint for PFOA toxicity, the UF is not applied. The target hum an serum level is: 22.9 ng/ml = 0.8 ng/ml (800 ng/L). 30 A s discussed above, the most recent median and 95th percentile NHANES values for serum PFOA in the general population are 2.1 and 5.7 ng/ml (CDC, 2015). Therefore, the target human serum level for delayed mammary gland development, 0.8 ng/ml, is below the median serum PFOA level in the U.S. general population. Development of Reference Dose based on delayed mammary gland development USEPA (2016a ) used a pharmacokinetic modeling approach to develop a species -independent clearance factor, 1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day that relates serum PFOA level (g/L) to dose (g/kg/day). As discussed in the Toxico kinetics section, this clearance factor predicts a serum:dr inking water ration of 114:1 with average drinking water consumption, consistent with the empirically observed average serum:drinking water ratio of greater than 100:1 in human populations exposed to PFOA through drinking water. The clearance factor can be used to calculate the RfD , as follows: 800 ng/L 800 10-4 L/kg/day = Clearance 0.11 ng/kg/day = RfD 2 10 Potential Health -based MCL based on increased relative liver weight Increased relative liver weight is a well -established toxicological effect of PFOA in both non-human primates and rodents and is more sensitive than most other toxicological effects. Increased liver weight occurs in newborn animals after in utero exposure, during early life from lactational exposure, and from exposures during adulthood. As discussed in the Mode of Action section, PFOA may cause increased relative liver weight through multiple biochemical and cellular pathways. Increased relative liver wei ght can co-occur with and/or progress to other types of hepatic toxicity and is considered relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. A ccording to USEPA IRIS guidance ( USEPA, 2012c), endpoints that are \"adverse, considered to be adverse, or a precursor to an adverse effect\" are appropriate as the basis for non -cancer risk assessment. The increased relative liver weight caused by PFOA is usually accompanied by hepatocellular hypertrophy, and it can co - occur with and/or progress to more severe hepatic effects including hepatocellular necrosis, fatty liver, increased serum and hyperplastic nodules. Additionally, PFOA caused hepatocellular adenomas in chronically exposed male rats in the study conducted by Biegel et al. (2001). Although these tumors were not reported to be increased in males rats in the earlier chronic study (Sibinski, 1987), Butenhoff et al. (2012) noted that these lesions represent a regenerative process and that diagnostic criteria for hepatic hyperplastic nodules have changed since the livers from the study were evaluated in 1986. I ncreased relative liver weight in mice can result either from in utero exposure during the prenatal period or from lactational exposure during the neonatal period (Wolf et al., 2007; White et al., 2009). In other studies, ultrastructural and/or histopathological changes indicative of liver toxicity persisted until adulthood ( age 3 months, Quist et al., 2015; age 18 months, Filgo et al., 2015) in offspring of dams dosed with PFOA during gestation. Hepatocellular hypertrophy and periportal inflammation occurred at doses below those that caused increased liver weight (Quist et al., 2015). It is not known whether these sensitive hepatic effects resulted from in utero exposure, lactational exposure, or both. Additionally, results from offspring at age 1 8 months suggest the possibility of an increased incidence of liver tumors from developmental exposures to PFOA, although the study was not designed as a carcinogenicity bioassay (Filgo et al., 2015). Although data from these studies are not amenable dose-response modeling, they support the conclusions that liver toxicity is a sensitive endpoint for PFOA, that the developmental period is a sensitive lifestage for PFOA's hepatic effects, and that increased relative liver weight is a relevant and appropriate endpoint for PFOA's toxicity. Selection of study and data for dose-response modeling of increased liver weight Increased relative liver weight has been observed in many studies of PFOA in both rodents and non-human primates. The five publications reporting studies of relative liver weight that were considered for dose-response modeling are summarized in the first part of Table 10 of the Animal Toxicology section. Studies were i ncluded if they provide serum PFOA data from the end of the dosing period, and, for rodent studies, include relatively low doses (1 mg/kg/day or less). R odent studies that meet these criteria were reported in four publications. The 90-day cynomolgus monkey study in which the lowest dose was 3 mg/kg/day is also included in Table 10 of theAnimal Toxicology section for comparison purposes, since it used a non- human primate species and has been the focus of risk assessments by other groups. T he 90 day cynomolgus monkey study (Thomford et al., 2001b; Butenhoff et al., 2002) was not considered appropriate for dose-response modeling for several reasons (discussed in detail in Appendix 3). The study does 2 11 not provide serum PFOA data that can be used for dose-response modeling because serum PFOA levels did not differ at the two lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg/day); the high dose (30/20 mg/kg/day) group is excluded for use in dose-response modeling due to overt toxicity. Additionally, the death of one of four animals in the low dose group may have been due to PFOA toxicity. Aside from its lack of utility for dose-response modeling, this study provides no indication of the NOAEL for PFOA toxicity in this species because of the lack of a relationship between administered or internal dose and response, and because of the possibility of overt toxicity at the lowest dose. T wo of the four rodent studies (Loveless et al., 2006; Perkins et al., 2004) used adult male rats, and one of these (Loveless et al. , 2006), also used adult male mice. Loveless et al. (2006) administered three different isomeric mixtures of PFOA (linear/branched, linear, and branched) to adult male mice and rats for 2 weeks, while Perkins et al. administered PFOA to adult male rats for 4, 7, or 13 weeks. As discussed in the Toxicology section, increased relative liver weight associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy is an early manifestation of PFOA's hepatic toxicity. This effect does not appear to increase in magnitude over time, but rather it appears to progress over time to other more severe hepatic effects (Butenhoff et al., 2012). Relative liver weight data from male CD -1 mice after 14 day exposures (Loveless et al., 2006) and 29 day exposures (Loveless et al., 2008) were compared based on administered dose, as Loveless et al. (2008) does not provide serum PFOA levels. This comparison shows that the dose- response curves for increased relative liver weight are similar for the 14 day and 29 day exposure periods. Furthermore, dose- response c urves for relative liver weight in male rats were similar aft er 4, 7, and 13 week exposures ( Perkins et al., 2004). Two additional developmental studies in mice (Lau et al., 2006; Macon et al., 2011) also met the criteria for inclusion in Table 10 of the Toxicology section . Lau et al. (2006) evaluated increased liver weight on GD 18 in pregnant mice dosed with PFOA on GD 1-18. The data for liver weight and serum PFOA levels in pregnant mice in this publication are not presented in a form that is appropriate for dose-response modeling of increased relative liver weight. Data on absolute liver weight and serum PFOA levels are presented in graphical form in the publication; numerical data for absolute liver weight, and liver weight relative to body weight minus weight of gravid uterus, were obtained from the investigator. M acon et al. ( 2011) evaluated relative liver weight on PND 1 in female offspring exposed in utero on GD 10 - 17. Comparison of serum PFOA level LOAELs for increased relative liver weight in neonatal female mice in Macon et al. (2011) and in adult male mice (Loveless et al., 2006) suggest similar sensitivity to this effect atboth life stages. The relative liver weight data from male mice exposed to branched/linear PFOA for 14 days (Loveless et al., 2006) were selected for dose-response modeling . These data are shown in Table 17. The branched/linear isomeric mixture is relevant to environmental contamination and human exposure, and almost all toxicological studies of PFOA used the bran ched/linear isomeric mixture. An increasing response with dose was observed in mice for increased relative liver weight from branched/linear PFOA over the range of doses used in this study. Data from both the standard strain and PPAR- alpha null strains of mice demonstrate that increased liver weight and other types of hepatic toxicity occur through both PPAR-alpha dependent and independent modes of action in mice, and these effects are considered relevant to humans. As shown in Figure 13 in the Mode of Action 2 12 section, increased liver weight was not correlated with PPAR -alpha activity in mice in Loveless et al. (2006). As discussed above, relative liver weight does not appear to increase in magnitude with longer exposure durations. Therefore, 14 days is considered to be of sufficient duration, particularly since dose- response modeling is based on serum PFOA level, rather than administered dose, thus avoiding uncertainties about whether internal dose increases with exposures longer than 14 days.

(2006). BMD and BMDL serum levels were deter mined for a BMR of a 10% increase in mean relative liver weight from the control values. All models for continuous data included in the software were run. R esults of the BMD modeling are shown in Table 18, and a more detailed explanation and the complete output of the BMDS software for each model are presented in Appendix 7. Both of the exponential models (models 4 and 5) ga ve identical fits . The se exponential models and the 3rd degree polynomial model ga ve acceptable fits to these data. The 3rd degree polynomial model over- fits the data at the high dose, forcing a fit and resulting in a biologically unlikely fit in this area of the dose-response curve. However, the fit of the 3 rd degree polynomial model at the lower doses (i.e., in the range of the BMD) is regular and biologically appropriate. It is unlikely that the forced fit at the high dose has any significant influence on the fit of the model at the BMD. Although the 3 rd degree polynomial model ga ve a slightly better fit than the exponential models and also yielded a slightly lower BMDL, the exponential models produced a highly comparable fit and a similar BMDL. As neither model appears to have a claim to greater biological significance, it was recommended that the point-of-departure be derived as the average of the BMDLs for both of these models. This yield ed an average BMDL of 4,351 ng/ml. 2 13 Table 18.

The AIC is defined as - 2 \u00d7 (LL - p), where LL is the log -likelihood of the model given the data, and p is the number of parameters estimat ed in the model. When comparing models, a lower AIC is preferable to a higher one (USEPA, 2012 a). d BMDs and BMDLs from the models used to derive the point of departure, as discussed in text. Application of uncertainty factors for increased relative liver weight The choice of UFs is consistent with current USEPA IRIS guidance (USEPA, 2012c) and previous risk assessments developed by NJDEP and the DWQI. T he BMDL of 4,351 ng/ml was used as the POD for RfD development. UFs were applied to the POD serum level of 4,351 ng/ml to obtain the Target Human Serum Level . The Target Human Serum level (ng/ml serum) is analogous to the RfD but is expressed in terms of internal, rather than administered, dose. Th e total of the UFs applied to the POD serum level was 300, and included the following f actor s: 10 - UF for human variation, to account for variation in susceptibility across the human population and the possibility that the available data may not be representative of individuals who are most sensitive to th e effect. 3 - UF for animal -to-human extrapolation, to account for toxicodynamic differences between hum ans and mi ce. The typical uncertai nty factor of 3 for toxicokinetic variability between species is not included because the risk assessm ent is based on com parison of internal dose (serum levels) rather than administered dose. 2 14 1 - UF for LOAEL to NOAEL . The point of departure is a BMDL, not a LOAEL. Therefore, an adjustment for use of a LOAEL is not necessary. 1 - UF for duration of exposure. The POD is based on incre ased liver weight resulting from exposure for 2 weeks , while the Health - based MCL is intended to protect for chronic exposure. However, increased liver weight, usually associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy, is an early manifestation of PFOA's hepatic toxicity . Data from the relevant studies (reviewed above) indicate that the dose-response for this effect, on an internal dose ( serum PFOA level) basis, is similar after 2 weeks of exposure and from longer exposures, and that this effect does not appear to occur at lower internal doses ( serum PFOA levels) or increase in magnitude with chronic exposures. Rather, the initial effect (increased liver weight accompanied by hepatocellular hypertrophy) appears to progress ov er time to other more severe hepatic types of effects. Therefore, an adjustment based on duration of exposure is not necessary. 10 - UF for more sensitive effects that are not otherwise considered (e.g. i ncomplete database). USEPA IRIS guidance ( USEPA, 2012c ) states that: \"If an incomplete database raises concern that further studies might identify a more sensitive effect, organ system, or lifestage, the assessment may apply a database uncertainty factor.\" Adverse effects on mammary gland development oc cur at doses much more than 10-fold lower than those that cause increased relative liver weight. Additionally, hepatic toxicity not associated with increased liver weight occur s at similarly low doses after developmental exposures. Therefore, a UF of 10 to account for more sensitive effects was applied . The target hum an serum level is: 4351 ng/ ml = 14.5 ng/ml (14,500 ng/L) 300 Development of Reference Dose for increased relative liver weight As above, the clearance factor (1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day ; USEPA, 2016a ) was used to derive the RfD from the Target Human Serum Level . This factor was used to develop the RfD that is the basis for the recommended Health - based MCL. As discussed in the Toxicokine tics section , the clearance factor is consistent with empirical data on the serum:drinking water ratio from communities with contaminated drinking water . It should be noted that health -based drinking water values may also be developed from target human serum levels for PFOA and other PFCs using an approach based on this ratio. 14,500 n g/L x 1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day = 2 ng/kg/day W here: 14,500 ng/L = Target Human Serum Concentration 1.4 x 10-4 L/kg/day = Clearance Factor 2 ng/kg/day = RfD 2 15 Relative Source Contribution factor A Relative Source Contribution (RSC) factor that accounts for non-drinking water sources including food, soil, air, water, and consumer products is used in the development of health-based drinking water concentrations based on non- carcinogenic effects. An RSC is used by the DWQI for Health -based MCLs, by USEPA for Maximum Contaminant Level Goals, and by other states in development of similar health -based drinking water values. The RSC is intended to prevent total exposure from a ll sources from exceeding the RfD (USEPA, 2000). When sufficient chemical-specific information on non-drinking water exposures is not available, a default RSC of 0.2 (20%) is used . This default value assumes that 20% of exposure comes from drinking water and 80% from other sources (USEPA, 2000). When sufficient chemical- specific exposure data are available, a less stringent chemical -specific RSC may be derived, with floor and ceiling RSC values of 20% and 80% (USEPA, 2000). The Health Effects Subcommittee concluded that there are insufficient data to develop a chemical -specific RSC for PFOA. There are no New Jersey -specific biomonitoring data for PFOA, and its frequent occurrence in NJ PWS suggests that New Jersey residents m ay also have higher exposure from non-drinking sources than the U.S. general population (e.g. NHANES). Elevated levels of PFOA were detected in PWS located throughout NJ in USEPA UCMR3 and other monitoring studies ; PFOA was detected much more frequently at > 20 ng/L in NJ PWS (10.5%) than nationwide (1.9%) in UCMR3 (discussed in the Drinking Water Occurrence section) . Potential sources of this contamination have been identified in some instances, while sources are unknown in other locations. Environmental contamination with PFOA that results in its presence in drinking water can arise from a number of different types of sources (reviewed in Fate and Transport Relevant to Drinking Water Contamination). These include releases to air, soil, and water from fluoropolymer telomer manufacturing facilities, on -site and off- site disposal from smaller industrial facilities that make products from fluoropolymer dispersions containing PFOA, releases of aqueous firefighting foams, and land application of biosolids f rom wastewater treatment plants treating waste containing PFOA, among others. These various sources may potentially result in human exposures through contamination of nearby soils, house dust, or other environmental media. In communities with drinking wate r contamination, consumption of produce from home gardens or grown locally was associated with higher serum levels of PFOA (Emmett et al., 2008; Steenland et al., 2009a ). T he exposure factors used to develop the Health- based MCL (b elow) are based on an adult drinking water consumption rate and body weight. The default RSC of 20%, while not explicitly intended for this purpose, also partially accounts for the higher PFOA exposures in infants. Exposures to i nfants , both breastfed and consuming formula prepared with contaminated drinking water, are much higher than in than older individuals. Infants consume much more fluid (breast milk or formula) than older individuals on a body weight basis; about 10- fold more from birth to 1 month of age, and 4 -6 fold more between ages 6-12 months. Additionally, PFOA concentrations in breast milk are similar or higher than in the mother's drinking water source (Post et al., 2012). F or these reasons, although serum levels in infants are similar to their mother's at birth (Post et al., 2012), they increase rapidly by several -fold shortly after birth for a period of at least several months. As shown in Figure 16, this increase was five -fold or greater in a considerable portion of infants evaluated in two studies (Fromme et al., 2010; Mogensen et al., 2015). Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations of results of a pharmacokinetic model predict median, 95 th percentil e, and maximum infant:mother plasma PFOA ratios of 4.5 -fold, 7.8-fold, 216 and 15.3-fold, respectively, during the period of greatest infant exposure (Verner et al., 2016a ; Figure 17). Figure 1 6. Changes in PFOA levels in breast -fed infants from birth to later timepoints (Fromme et al., 2010; Mogensen et al., 2015) Figure 17. Monte Carlo simulations of child/mother ratios of plasma PFOA levels (ng/ ml) a breastfeeding period of 30 months. Black line - 50th percentile; blue line - 5th percentile; red line - 95th percentile; dotted lines - minimum and maximum values (Verner et al., 2016). These higher infant exposures must be considered because t he toxicological e ffects of concern (delayed mammary gland developmen t and increased relative liver weight) occur from short term exposures relevant to elevated exposures in infancy. C ross-fostering studies (discussed in T oxicology section) show that lactational exposure causes increased relative liver weight and delayed mammar y gland development (Wh ite et al., 2007; White et al., 2009) in animals with no in utero exposure. Additionally, hepatic toxicity that persists until adulthood occurs in offspring of dams exposed to low doses of PFOA during gestation (Quist et al., 2015). These effects could result from prenatal or lactational exposure, or both. 217 For the reasons discussed above, the default RSC of 20% is used to develop the Health- based MCL. Development of potential Health-based MCL based on hepatic effects 2 ng/kg/day x 70 kg x 0.2 = ng/L (0.014 g/L) 2 L/day Wh ere: 2 ng/kg/day = Reference Dose 70 kg = assumed adult body weight 0.2 = Relative Source Contribution from drinking water 2 L/day = assumed adult daily drinking water intake Potential He alth-based MC L based on car cinogenicity PFOA caused tumor s in mal e rats in two chroni c studie s (Sibins ki et al., 1987, Butenhof f et al., 20 12; a nd Biegel e t al., 2001). It caused a statistically s ignificant inc rease in te sticular Leydig cell tumors in bot h studies, as well as a s tatistically s ignificant inc rease in live r tumor s and pancreati c tumor s in Biege l et al. (2001). The testicula r tumor da ta from the chroni c dietary exposur e rat study reported b y Sibins ki et al. (1987) a nd Butenhof f et al. (2012) are appropriat e for BM D modeli ng and can b e used as the ba sis for developme nt of a cance r potency factor. Thi s study used two PFO A dos e levels, and t he incidence of testicular tum ors increased in a dose-related fashion. Becaus e Biege l et al.

Therefo re, the linear low -dose extrapolation approach i s appropriat e for dos e-respons e modeli ng of these testicular tumors. T he linear l ow- dose extrapolation approach i s based on t he assumption tha t exposur e to any dos e of a carcinogen result s in some risk of can cer. The incidenc e of testicula r tumor s (Sibins ki et al., 1987: Butenhof f et al., 2012) wa s 0/49, 2/50, a nd 7/50 in the control, 2.6.0.86). B ecause s erum P FOA level s were not m easured in thi s study, th e BMD L and slope f actor were modeled in term s of dose administered to rats. The value based on administered dos e to rats was then converted to t he equivale nt hum an dose , based on pharmacokineti c difference s (ratio of half-lives) between rats and humans. A benchmark response (BMR) of 0.05 (5%) tumor incidence was selected for consistency with the recommendations for selection of the POD for cancer potency factor derivation in the USEPA (2005b) Guidance for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. This value is close to the 4% response at the lowest dose in this data set. Results of the modeling are shown in Table 21, and the complete output from the modeling is found in Appendix 8. 218 Table 19. BMD modeling (0.05 BMR; 5% response) of rat testicular tumor data (Butenhoff et al., 2012)a Mod el p-value BMDL (mg/kg/day) Rat Cancer Potency Factor (mg/kg/day)-1 Rat Dose at 1 x 10-6 risk (mg/kg/day) Gamma (power restricted to 1) Multistage (betas 0) Weibull (power restricted to 1) 62.6851 of Gamma (and other identical models) and Log- logistic (slope restricted to 1) 2.36 0.021 4.8 x 10 -5 a Results are shown for all models that gave an acceptable visual fit. b A larger Chi-s quare p-v alu e indicates a better fit to the data. c AIC: A measure of information loss from a dose-r esponse model that can be used to compare a specified set of models . The AIC is defined as -2\u00d7 (LL - p), where LL is the log-l ikelihood of the model given the d ata,and p is the number of parameters estimated in the model. When comparing models, a lower AIC is preferable to a higher one (USEPA, 2012a). d BMDs and BMDLs from the models used to derive the potency factor, as discussed in the text. The Gamma model with power restricted to 1 (and the other models shown in the same cell in Table 19) and the Log-logistic model with slope restricted to 1 fit the data very similar ly and yielded v ery similar BMDLs. Because neither of these models has a form that is obviously more biologically accurate, it is appropriate to average their BMDLs. The average BMDL for these models is BMR, factor in rats is 0.021 (mg/kg/day)-1, and the dose in rats corresponding to a 1 x 10-6 risk is estimated as 4.8 x 10-5 mg/kg/day. These values are shown in the last row of Table 19. As above, the dose-response modeling was based on admi nistered PFOA dose to rats (mg/kg/day) instead of internal dose (serum PFOA level) since serum PFOA levels were not measured in the study. Thus, the rat doses derived through the modeling must be converted to equivalent human doses. As per USEPA (2005b) guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment, this adjustment is made based on pharmacokinetic differences between species instead of through the default adjustment based on body weight3/4. To make the interspecies adjustment, the dose in male rats corresponding to a 1 x 10-6 cancer risk is converted to the human equivalent dose based on the 2 19 ratio of half-lives in the two species. This approach accounts for the much longer half-life of PFOA in humans than male rats, although it is associated with more uncerta inty than an approach using measured serum PFOA levels. T he half -lives used for this adjustment were 7 days for male rats and 2.3 years (840 days) for humans. The half- life in male Sprague -Dawley rats after a single gavage dose of 0.1 to 25 mg/kg PFOA was about 7 days and was independent of dose (Kemper et al., 2003). Bartell et al. (2010a ) estimated a human half -life of 2.3 years for a one-year period after exposure to contaminated drinking water ceased; elimination rate was not affected by age or gender. The ratio of these human and rat half-lives (840 days/7 days) is 120. T herefore, the human dose corresponding to a 1 x 10-6 lifetime cancer risk is estimated as: (4.8 x 10-5 mg/kg/day) / 120 = 4 x 10-7 mg/kg/day (4 x 10-4 g/kg/day; 0.4 ng/kg/day) T his corresponds to a human cancer potency factor of 2.52 (mg/kg/day)-1 (i.e. rat cancer potency factor x ratio of human/rat half- lives; 0.021 (mg/kg/day)-1 x 120). U sing default drinking water assumptions (2 L/day water consumption; 70 kg body weight), the potential Health -based MCL at the 1 x 10-6 lifetime cancer risk level is: 0.4 ng/kg/day x 70 kg = 14 ng/L (0.014 g /L) 2 L T his value is identical to the Health -based MCL based on non-cancer endpoints developed above. Recommended Health -based MCL A potential Health -based MCL based on the RfD for delayed mammary gland development was not developed, for reasons discussed above . The potential Health -based MCL based on the RfD for increased relative liver weight is 14 ng/L (0.014 \u00b5g/L). The potential Health- based MCL based on a lifetime carcinogenic risk one in one million (1 x 10-6), the cancer risk goal for New Jersey MCLs, is also 14 ng/L. T herefore, the recommended Health -based MCL is 14 ng/L (0.014 \u00b5g/L). DISCUSSION OF UNCERTAINTIES P FOA is associated with multiple human health effects in epidemiology studies of the general population and communities with drinking water exposure . There is evidence to support multiple criteria for causality for some of these end points. Although causality cannot be definitively proven for the se associations of PFOA with human health effects, these numerous findings indicate the need for caution about drinking water exposures that will increase serum PFOA to levels substantially higher than in the general population. This is particularly true because elevated serum PFOA levels persist for many years after exposure ends , due to its long human half- life (several years ). O ngoing exposure to the recommended Health -based MCL of 14 ng /L is expected to increase serum PFOA levels, on average, by about 1.6 ng/ml (ppb) with average daily water consumption and 2.8 ng/ml (ppb) with upper percentile daily water consumption in adults . Increases in serum PFOA levels are predicted to be several -2 20 fold higher than in infants than in adults, in cluding both breastfed infants whose mothers ingest PFOA in drinking water or from formula prepared with water contaminated with PFOA . The potential for prenatal and early life exposures to environmental contaminants to cause adverse health effects later in life is currently a focus of high interest in both epidemiology and toxicology (Boekelheide et al., 2012; Heindel and Vandenberg, 2015). Developmental exposures to PFOA caused effects in mice, with no threshold (NOAEL) identified , at doses far below those that caused effects in older animals . These effects include persistent changes in the mammary gland, persistent damage to hepat ic cells, persistent neurobehavioral effects from a single relatively low dose to the pregnant dam, and obesity and metabolic changes inadulthood. Some of these effects were not evident until later in life and/or adulthood, long after theadministered PF OA has been eliminated from the body. Some of these effects (obesity/overweight later in life after prenatal exposure; neurobehavioral effects) have been evaluated in humans, with both positive andnegative findings among the studies. As discussed in the Development of Health -Based MCL section, the Target Human Serum Level based on delayed mammary gland development in mice is below the serum PFOA levels prevalent in the general population. The proposed Health-based MCL includes an uncertainty factor to protect for more sensitive developmental effects . However , there is still uncertainty about whether it is sufficiently protective for subtle effects later in life that may result from very low exposures during thedevelopmental period. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of PFOA have been studied only in the rat, a species in which PFOA is rapidly excreted by females. There is uncertainty about chronic effects including carcinogenicity in other species such as mice in which PFOA is persistent in both sexes. Furthermore, the chronic studies did not assesseffects including carcinogenicity which might result from exposures during the critical developmental stagesnow known to be sensitive periods for PFOA toxicity. Uncertainties about the human re levance of effects seen in animals are inherent to all risk assessments based on animal data. As reviewed in detail in this document, the available information indicates that the effects ofPFOA observed in experimental animals are relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Available information indicates that the target organs and modes of action are generally similar for PFOA and some other PFCs, including PFNA (DWQI, 2015c). Therefore, the toxicity of PFOA other maybe additive. Although PFOA and other PFCs, including PFNA, are known to co- occur in some NJ public water supplies, the potential for additive toxicity of PFOA and other PFCs was not considered in development of theHealth -based MCL.CITATIONS A bbott, B.

Appendix 1 - page 4APPENDIX 2: Comparison of USEPA Offi ce of Water Health Advisory and DWQI recommended for PFOA The b asis for Health Advisory and the recommended DWQI Health-based MCL, and other relevant information about these two drinking water values, are compared in the table below. Additional information is provided in the text that follows the table. Parameter USEPA Office of Water Health Advisory DWQI Recommended Health-based MCL Value 70 ng/L 14 ng/L General statement \"Protects the most sensitive populations, with a margin of protection from a lifetime of exposure.\" \"Developed using a risk assessment approach intended to be protective for chronic (lifetime) exposure.\" As discussed in this document, PFOA is associated with several human health effects, some with evidence supporting multiple criter ia for causality, within the general population exposure range even without additional exposure from drinking water . Furthermore, the Reference Dose (RfD) for mammary g land effects in mice is below the average exposure level in the general population, and other toxicolog ical effects occurred at similarly low doses in animal studies. Therefore, the Health Effects Subcommittee concluded that additional exposure from drinking water may poten tially pose so me risk of health effects. For th is reason, it cannot be definitively conclu ded that lif etime exposure to these drinking water concentrations is protectiv e of sensitive subpopulations with a margin of exposure. USEPA recognizes that human studies provide evidence of asso ciations of several health effects with PFOA. However, USEPA co ncludes that the human studies do not provide quantitative information on the exposure levels or serum levels associated with these health effects. Therefore, USEPA did not consider the possib ility that health effects may result from exposures within the g eneral population range, even with no addition al exposure from d rinking water . USEPA also dismissed the low dose toxicological effects in animal studies from consideratio n in risk assessment. See discussion of these points below. Appendix 2 - page 5Parameter 2 ng/kg/day x Based on delayed ossification of phalanges and accelerated male puberty after developmental exposures to mice (Lau et al., 2006). x Data do not follow typical dose-response of greater response as dose increases. (See figures below.) An uncertainty factor of 10 was applied for LOAEL-to-NOAEL extrapolation. The basis and precedent for this approach with dose-response curves of this type is uncertain and may be subject to debate. Based on Benchmark Dose modeling of increased liver weight in mice, with additional uncertainty factor for more sensitive developmental effects at much lower doses (delayed mammary gland development, persistent liver toxicity, and others). Note: USEPA and DWQI RfDs are identical numerically , with the exception of application of an additional uncertainty factor of 10 in the DWQI RfD to account for more sensitive developmental endpoints. These more sensitive endpoints were not considered in development of the USEPA RfD. Issues related to endpoints selected as the basis for RfDs by DWQI and USEPA are further discussed below. Interspecies conversion in RfD development Pharmacokinetic modeling was used to predict average serum PFOA concentrations at the NOAELs and/or LOAELs in toxicological studies. A clearance factor that relates serum PFOA level to human administered dose (applicable to serum PFOA data from any species) was used to obtain the Human Equivalent Doses (HEDs) at the modeled average serum levels. Uncertainty factors were applied to the HEDs to obtain potential RfDs. Benchmark Dose modeling was performed on measured serum PFOA concentrations at each dose from the end of the dosing period to derive a serum level Benchmark Dose (BMD). This approach has less uncertainty than use of modeled serum PFOA data. Uncertainty factors were applied to the BMD serum level to obtain the Target Human Serum Level (i.e. the RfD in terms of serum PFOA level). The same clearance factor used by USEPA was applied to the Target Human Serum Level to obtain the RfD. (cont.) USEPA (cont.) DWQI (cont.) Drinking water concentration estimated to result in one in one million (10 -6) lifetime cancer risk 500 ng/L. Predicted risk at this concentration based on the DWQI evaluation is about 4 x 10 -5 (i.e. 40-fold higher than 1 in 1 million). 14 ng/L (Identical to the value based on non- cancer effects) USEPA and DWQI cancer assessments are both based on increased incidence of testicular tumors in a chronic rat study (Butenhoff et al., 2012), and the Benchmark Doses developed by USEPA and DWQI for these tumors are almost identical. The two assessments differ in the approach used for animal-to-human conversion. DWQI used the ratio of half-lives to account for interspecies pharmacokinetic differences, since serum PFOA data are not provided in this study. Although USEPA considered interspecies pharmacokinetic differences in animal-to-human conversion for non-cancer effects, the default animal-to-human extrapolation (ratio of body weights to the \u00be power) was used by USEPA for cancer risk assessment. This default approach does not account for interspecies pharmacokinetic differences. USEPA's use of an approach that does not account for pharmacokinetic differences for cancer risk assessment, although pharmacokinetic differences were considered for non-cancer risk assessment, does not appear to be logical or consistent. Relative Source Contribution Factor 20%. To account for non-drinking water exposures. 20%. To account for non-drinking water exposures. Also implicitly accounts for greater exposures to breastfed and formula fed infants than older individuals. Assumed Drinking Water Consumption 0.054 L/kg/day. Based on 90 th percentile for lactating woman. USEPA also developed an alternative Health Advisory of 100 ng/L that applies to adults in the general population based on standard adult exposure assumptions (2.5 L/day water consumption; 80 kg body weight). More information is provided below under Sensitive Subpopulations. 0. 029 L/kg/day. Based on default upper percentile adult exposure assumptions (2 L/day water consumption, 70 kg body weight). Appendix 2 - from ongoing exposure to USEPA Health Advisory and DWQI recommended Health-based MCL (see bar graph below) x With average water consumption: 8.0 ng/ml; 4.8-fold increase from U.S general population median of2.1 ng/ml (CDC, 2015). x With upper percentile water consumption: 14 ng/ml; 7.7-fold increase from U.S. general population median. x With average water consumption: 1.6 ng/ml; 1.8- fold increase from U.S. general population median. x With upper percentile water consumption: 2.8 ng/ml; 2.3- fold increase from U.S. general population median. Note: A c learan ce factor that relates human P FOA e xposures t o human PFOA s erum levels wa s developed by USE PA scientists ( Lorber an d Egeghy, 2011) . This factor can b e used to pr edict increases in serum PFOA from dr inking wat er ex posures. Although th is facto r was us ed in another par t of the USEPA (2016a) assessment ( to convert serum levels from laboratory animals to h uman do ses, d iscussed above), USEPA does not acknowledge that i t is possible t o predict th e increas e in serum P FOA that will result fr om ongoing exposure to a given concentration of PFOA in drinking water (ASDWA, bottle fed infants. USEPA does not include women who plan to become pregnant in its definition of sensit ive subpopulations, but states that stated that states may choose to expand the sensiti ve subgroups to include women of child- bearing age (ASDWA, 2016). This exclusion does not appear to be supportable becau se the body burden of PFOA remains elevated for man y years after exposure ceases. Therefore, if body burden is elevated prior to pregnancy, it will remain elevated during pregnancy and lactation. USEPA (2016a) also calculated a lifetime HA value for alternative exposure scenarios for the general population (adult s age 21 and older) of 100 ng/L based on standard adult exposure assumpti ons. USEPA states that the Lifeti me Health Advisory of 70 ng/L is protective for effects other than developmental toxicity, such as testicular and kidney cancer, l iver damage, and imm une effects. However, it has been reported in the news media that some states have interpreted the USEPA designation of sensitive subgroups to mean that those not in these sensitive subpopulations may continue to drink water exceeding the USEPA Health Advisory (e.g. WAAYTV, 2016). As is the case for all Health-based MCLs developed by the DWQI, the Health-based MCL recommended for PFOA is intended to be protective of all individuals, including sensitive subpopulations. Sensitive subpopulations for health effects of PFOA include women who plan to become pregnant, pregnant women, lactating women, and breast-fed and bottle-fed infants. Appendix 2 - page 8Endpoints us ed as basis o f DWQI recommended Health-based MCL The primary basis for the recommended Health-based MCL is a n RfD based on increased relative liver weight i n mice (Loveless et a l., 2006) . As d iscussed elsewher e in this do cument, the Health E ffects S ubcommittee cond ucted an ex tensive and detailed review o f the hepatic effects o f PFOA. It was co ncluded that i ncreased relative liver we ight i n animal studies is a sensitive and well es tablished effect o f PFOA which is acco mpanie d by a nd/or can pr ogress t o more s evere forms o f liver t oxici ty, and that it should be considered r elevant to hu mans. Additionally, human exposure to PFOA in the general population a nd in communities w ith contaminated drinking water is associated with increased serum levels o f liver enz ymes, s trongly suggesting that l ow exposures to PFOA a ffect liver f unction in humans. The Health E ffects S ubcommittee also co nducted an e xtensive review of de layed mammary gland de velopment in mice from de velopmental expo sure to P FOA. This ef fect w as observed in 9 separate s tudies from 5 publications an d follows a typical ( monotonic) do se-response cur ve, with gr eater ef fects at hi gher doses. The Health Effects S ubcommittee concluded that this e ffect is adverse, r esults i n persistent s tructu ral cha nges t hat ar e considered to b e per manent, and should be consid ered relevant to humans. Ad ditionally, recent human studies (Fei et al., 2010; Romano et al., 2016; Timmermann et al.,2016) suggest an association of PFOA ex posure with decreased duration of breast feeding, an effect which may potentially be relevant to eff ects on mammary gland development. The Health Effects Subcommittee developed an RfD for delayed mammary gland development (Macon et al., 2011) based on the Benchmark Dose presented in Post et al. (2012). A Health- based MCL based on this RfD would be 1 ng/L or less. The Health Effects Subcommittee chose not to use this RfD as the basis for a recommended Health -based MCL, not because o f uncertainty abo ut the scientific validity of doin g so, but rath er because of lack of precedent for use of this endpoint as the primar y basis for health-based criteria for environmental contaminants. However, the Health Effects Subcommittee concluded that an additional uncertainty factor to protect for develo pmental effects (delayed mammary gland developmen t; persistent liver toxicity) at much lower doses than those that caused increased liver weight should be incorporated into the RfD. USEPA (2016a) provides a detailed summary of studies of mammary glan d development in mice but chose not to consid er this effect in risk assessment. The reasons provided by USEPA for not considering this endpoint (mo de of action not known, ef fects o ccurr ed only at higher doses in a second strain of mice, functional significance is un clear) do not appear to be scientifically v alid and/or are also equally or more applicab le to the endpoints selected by USEPA as the basis for its Health Advisory (d iscussed further below in the section on End points used as basis of EPA Health Advisory). In regard to the issue of strain difference in susceptibility, it should be noted that almost all of the studies of developmental exposures to PFOA and mammary gland development were con ducted in CD-1 mice. A second str ain of mice (C57/Bl6) was in cluded in only one study in which a very small number of mice of th is strain were used in each dose group (Tu cker et al., 2015). USEPA (2016a) does not discuss that the high er LOAEL for effects o n the mammary gland in C57Bl/6 mice as compar ed to CD-1 mice may potentially be explained by pharmacokinetic Appendix 2 - page 9differences ( lower s erum P FOA co ncentrations from t he same do se of P FOA in t he C57/Bl6 strain) an d/or the very small number o f C57/Bl6 mice per dose group, limiting the ability to achieve statistical significance (Tucker e t al., 2015 ). The Health Effects Su bcommittee also co nsidered persistent liver toxicity from develo pmental exposures to very low doses of PFOA (Quist et al., 2015). Altho ugh these effects cannot be used as the basis for an RfD because the serum PFOA d ata needed for dose-response modeling are not provided, they give further indicatio n of effects at much lower doses than those that cause increased liver weight, the primary basis f or the recommended RfD. The low doses at which these persistent hepatic effects from dev elopmental exp osures occurred were not considered by USEPA in developing its Health Advisory. Endpoints us ed as basis o f USE PA Hea lth Advisory The U SEPA Health Advisory is based o n an RfD for de layed o ssifica tion (conversi on of cartilage to b one dur ing development) of proximal phalanges and accelerated male pu berty in offspri ng in a developmental s tudy o f CD-1 mice (Lau et al., 2006 ). USEPA s tates that these effects h ave lifelong co nsequences. However, del ayed ossification in Lau et al . (2006) represents a delay in t iming of de velopment r ather than a permanent s tructural change, b ecause the phalanges developed normally i n mice treated with PFOA t hat wer e not sacrificed prior to del ivery in t his study (personal c ommunication w ith C. L au). Therefore, the long t erm c onsequences an d functional s ignificance of t his ef fect a re un clear. Similarl y, the long term co nsequences a nd functional significance of a ccelerated puberty ar e unclear. This is particularly noteworthy b ecause one of t he reasons pr ovide d by US EPA for n ot considering delayed mammary gl and development in r isk assessment i s that its functio nal significance is unclear, a lthough de velopmental exposures to PFOA caus e structural a nd/or hi stopathological changes th at persist until a dulthood in th e mammary gland. In regard to di fferences in s train s ensitivity, t here is a major difference in sensitivity t o effects o f gestational P FOA e xposure on de layed ossification in ICR mice (Yahia et a l., 2010) as c ompared to the CD-1 m ice used by L au et al . (2006). The LOAEL ( 10 de layed ossification in t he ICR mice were m uch higher t han t he LOAEL ( 1 mg/kg/day) in CD-1 mice. In I CR mice, de layed ossification o ccurre d only at a dose at or ab ove the doses that caus ed maternal to xicity, decr eased fetal we ight, an d decreased pup survival ; no pups survived until 4 days o f age at 10 m g/kg/d ay, the LOAEL for de layed ossification. This large differen ce in s train s ensitivity is e specially noteworthy because o ne of US EPA's reasons for d ismissing effects o n mammary g land development f or consideration in r isk assessment i s the strain d ifference observ ed by T ucker et al . (2015), which may be e xplai ned by factors other than differences in intrinsic s ensitivity (discussed a bove). Accelerated puberty in male a nimals has not been reported in s tudies o f PFOA ot her than L au et al. (2006). T o the knowledge of t he Health E ffects Sub committee, this e ffect was n ot assess ed in developmental s tudies o f mice other than L au et a l. (2006). Timing of puberty in o ffspring was assesse d in a two generation r at study (Butenhoff e t al., 2004) , and accelerated puberty was not observed in male offspring in this study. Appendix 2 - page 10The endpoints selected by USEPA (2016a) as the basis for the Health Advisory do not follow a typical (monotonic) dose-response in which greater effects occur with increasing dose (see graphs of data from Lau et al., 2006, below). In Lau et al. (2006), delayed ossification occurred at the lowest dose (1 mg/kg/day) but was not significantly increased at some of the higher doses. Acceleration of puberty in males in Lau et al. (2006) was greatest at the lowest dose (1 mg/kg/day), with a lesser effect with each increasing dose, and puberty was delayed rather than accelerated at the highest dose. USEPA (2016a) did not mention the shapes of these dose- response curves in its discussions of these endpoints. They considered the lowest dose to be the LOAEL for both of these effects and applied an uncertainty factor of 10 for extrapolation from LOAEL-to-NOAEL. However, the Health Effects Subcommittee is not aware of any precedent for use of an uncertainty factor for extrapolation from LOAEL-to-NOAEL for these types of dose response curves. The basis for application of this uncertainty factor, based on the assumption that the NOAEL is 10-fold lower than the lowest dose, is uncertain and may be subject to debate for dose-response curves of this type. In contrast, effects considered by the Health Effects Subcommittee for dose-response modeling (increased relative liver weight and delayed mammary gland development) follow typical monotonic dose-response curves and provide data appropriate for Benchmark Dose modeling. Finally, the modes of action for delayed ossification and accelerated puberty in males are not known. This is noteworthy because one of the reasons provided by USEPA for not considering effects on mammary gland development in risk assessment is that the mode of action is not known. Consideration of data from human epidemiological studies As discussed in detail in the Epidemiology section of this document, PFOA is associated with several human health effects, some with evidence supporting multiple criteria for causality, in the general population exposure and in communities with exposure from contaminated drinking water. USEPA (2016a) acknowledges that associations of PFOA and numerous health endpoints Appendix 2 - page 11\u0003are observed in these human populations and that associations with some effects hav e consistently been found in multiple human stud ies. However, USEPA states that, while these human studies are useful for hazard identification, they cannot be used quantitatively because the PFOA exposures at which the associations were observed are unknown or highly uncertain. Although the Health Effects Subcommittee agrees that the h uman data have limitations that preclude their use as the primary basis for risk assessmen t, it does not agree with USEPA that the serum PFOA concentr ations and PFOA exposures associated with human health effects are highly uncertain or unknown. Relevant to this point, it is noted that the German Human Biomonitorin g Commission recently developed a Human Biomonitoring Level I (the serum level below which adverse health effects are not expected) for PFOA of 2 ng/ml, close to the current med ian PFOA serum level in the U.S. general population. This HBM I is based on the serum PFOA lev els associated with increased time to pregnancy, decreased fetal g rowth, increased serum cholesterol, and d ecreased immune response in humans, and with delayed mammary gland development in mice (Apel et al., 2016). USEPA (2016a) provides the following reaso ns for its conclusions: Serum levels may hav e decreased (in both the general population an d in communities with drinking water exposure) prior to when the blood sample was taken. Ther efore, the effects may have been due to earlier exposures that were hig her than ind icated by the measured serum PFOA levels. It is unlikely that this is a majo r source of uncertainty in evaluation of exp osure since PFOA serum levels decrease slowly (half-life of several years) and are generally stable over time. In the C8 Health Study, blood samples were tak en before or soon after the installation of treatment to remove PFOA from drinking water. Participants' blo od was drawn between August 2005 and August 2006, with over 8 0% of samples taken in March 2006 or earlier , and treatment removal began between March 2006 and September 2008 (WVU Sch ool of Medicine, 2008; Frisbee et al., 2009; Fitz-Simons et al, 2013). Additionally, if effects wer e actually due to previo us exposures that were higher than those at the time of blo od sampling, it would mean that th e detrimental effects of PFOA are persistent and do not resolve when exposures decrease, which would increase the level of concern about the effects. x PFOA measured in serum may result from metabolism of precu rsors to PFOA rather than direct exposure to PFOA itself. This does not appear to be a valid reason to dismiss consideration of serum PFOA levels as a measure of PFOA exposure. Effects of PFOA would be the same regardless of wh ether the source of exposure is PFOA itself or metabolism of precursors to PFOA. x Co-exposure to other PFCs, even if accounted for as a potential confounding factor in the statistical analysis, increase uncertainty about observed associations of health en dpoints with PFOA. However, co-exposure to other chemicals is a general issue for all hu man stu dies of exposure to environmental contaminants an d does not preclude evaluation of the levels of PFOA ex posure associated with health endpoints. Appendix 2- page 12 \u0003 \u0003Consideration of increases in serum PFOA levels from exposure to PFOA in drinking water As noted in the table at the beginning of this Appendix, a clearance factor developed by USEPA scien tists (Lorber and Egeghy, 2011) relates human PFOA exposures to human PFOA ser um levels. This facto r can be used to predict increases in serum PFOA fro m ongoing drinking water exposures. The bar gr aph below shows the predicted increases in serum PFOA lev els from ongoing exposure in drinking water at the USEPA (201 6a) Health Advisory (70 ng/L) , the MCL (14 ng/L). Predictions based on both average and upper percentile drinking water ingestion rates are shown . USEPA (2016a) used the clearance factor to convert NOAEL and LOAEL ser um levels from laboratory animals to human equivalent doses (p. 4-13 of USEPA, 2016a) and discusses that it relates human PFOA dose to human PFOA serum level, including fr om d rinking water exposure 2-51 of USEPA, 2016b). However, USEPA does not acknowled ge that it is possible to predict in creases in serum PFOA levels from exposures to PFOA at Advisory concentration (ASDWA, 2016; The Health Effects Subcommittee has ev aluated this question and concludes that the use of the clearance factor to predict increases in serum PFOA levels from drinking water exposures is technically sound and is not subject to debate. Several health effects, some with evidence supporting multip le criteria for causality, ar e associated with PFOA exposures at serum levels well below those that would result from exposure to 70 ng/L in drinking water . The Health Effects Subcommittee therefore co ncludes that elevations in serum PFOA levels of the magnitude expected from ongoing exposure to 70 ng/L (the USEPA Health Advisory) in drinking water are not desirable an d may not be protective of public health. Appendix 2- page 1314 ng/L - Health-based MCL recommended by DWQI Health Effects Subcommittee 40 ng/L - NJDEP drinking water guidance (2007) based on older toxicology data 70 ng/L - USEPA Lifetime Health Advisory Finally, a s discussed e lsewhere in t his document, several st udies have shown t hat se rum PFOA concentrations in b reastfe d infants increase several f old from levels at bi rth (which ar e similar t o maternal levels) w ithin the first f ew months of life ( see figure below). Exposures to inf ants who consum e formula prepared with co ntaminated water ar e also highest dur ing this t ime per iod, and serum PFOA levels r emain elevated for the first s everal years of life ( see figure below). Therefore, increases in blood serum levels in inf ants and children fr om exposure to PFOA in drinking water are expected to be several-fold higher than those shown in the bar graph above. USEPA recognizes that lactating women and bottle-fed infants are sensitive subpopulations for exposure to PFOA in drinking water. The Health Effects Subcommittee also concludes that the elevated exposures during infancy and early childhood are of particular concern because early life effects are sensitive endpoints for the toxicity of PFOA. Additionally, the Health Effects Subcommittee concludes women who may become pregnant should also be included as sensitive subpopulations, because the body burden of PFOA remains elevated for many years after exposure ceases. Therefore, if serum PFOA levels are elevated when a woman becomes pregnant, they will remain elevated during pr egnancy and lactation. From Verner et al. (2016).

Appendix 2 - APPENDIX 3: Risk Consid erations for Butenhoff et al. (2002) Subchronic Cynomolgus Monkey Study T he Butenhoff et al. (2002) six month study in male cynomolgus monkeys is described in detail in the Toxicology section of this document. As discussed in the Toxicology section, only 3 of 4 of the low dose monkeys and 2 of 6 of the high dose monkeys tolerated the administered dose well enough to complete the study, while all 6 animals in the mid-dose group (10 mg/kg/day) completed the study. The LOAEL in this study was 3 mg/kg/day based on mortality (25%) possibly attributed to treatment and increased liver weight, and the NOAEL was not identified. Furthermore, it is important to note that 6 months represents less than 2% of the lifespan of this species of monkey, which is about 30 years. It is not known whether additional or more severe effects would have occurred with continued dosing of the monkeys that were able to tolerate dosing for the full 6 months of the study. Therefore, if this study were to be used as the basis for risk assessment, an uncertainty factor (UF) for less than chronic exposure duration should be included. In the study, serum PFOA levels were analyzed every 2 weeks, and it appeared that steady state was reached after 2 to 4 weeks of dosing. Importantly, the serum levels were highly variable between animals and over time in the same animal, and they did not increase proportionally with dose. The average serum levels in the 0, 3, 10, 30/20 mg/kg/day groups, 2004a). The PFOA concentrations in liver also did not appear to increase with dose or time, andthe highest concentration in the liver was in a high dose animal sacrificed at week 5. Butenhoff et al. (2004b) reported benchmark dose modeling of the liver-to-brain weight data from this study. A BMIC 10 (maximum likelihood estimate of PFOA serum concentration at 10% effect level) of 40,000 ng/ml and a LBMIC 10 (lower bound estimate of serum concentration at 10% effect level) of 23,000 ng/ml were derived. The data on liver-to-brain weight ratio versus serum PFOA concentration are shown in Figure A-1 (below). As can be seen from the graph in Figure A-1, Benchmark Dose (BMD) modeling of these data is not appropriate for the following reasons: The dose-response relationship needed to support BMD modeling does not exist, since (as stated by Butenhoff et al. (2002) the liver-to-brain weight ratio did not increase with dose. Additionally, there are an insufficient number of data points for BMD modeling. In the modeling conducted by Butenhoff et al. (2004b), the highest dose group was dropped, leaving only two data points for dosed groups plus the control group. It should be noted that the reported LBMIC 10 of 23,000 ng/L is within the same range as the serum PFOA concentration in the low dose monkey that was sacrificed in moribund condition during the weeks prior to its sacrifice. Appendix 3 - page 18Based on the above considerations, this study does not appear to be appropriate as the basis for a health-based drinking water concentration. In addition to the lack of dose response, a very small number of animals completed the study, and there was a wide variation in the responses of the individual animals. If a risk assessment were to be developed based on this study, in spite of its numerous limitations, the following point of departure (POD) and UFs appear to be appropriate: x The serum level at the low dose, 3 mg/kg/day should be used as the POD. This dose was the LOAEL for both increased liver weight and increased mortality. x In addition to the standard UFs for intraspecies (10) and interspecies toxicodynamic (3) variability used in risk assessments based on serum levels, a UF of 10 for extrapolation of a LOAEL to NOAEL and a UF of 10 for a study of less than chronic study duration, should be applied. These UFs combine to give a total UF of 3000. x An additional UF for database limitations appears to be warranted due to the very small number of animals that completed the study, because mortality possibly related to treatment occurred in the low dose group, and because potentially more sensitive developmental endpoints were not evaluated.

Outcome: ln-TSH Major Findings: Modeled (% change 1-17 %=-0.5 (95% CI -2.4, 1.5) Major Limitations: Mostly cross-sectional design precludes much causal inference, Absence of measurements of child triiodothyronine, Reliance on recall for thyroid diagnosis (though a more string ent case definition produced similar results). Appendix 4- page 50Population: Children (age 1-17) who consumed water (for at least 1 year) from a water district with known PFOA contamination, n=10,725 were included in the analysis.

Sex specific models were used. Covariates and confounders considered include year of NHANES cycle, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, BMI, and alcohol intake. Major Limitations: Investigators based PFOA on a single serum sample, likely to represent medium-term internal dose, samples taken at several time points might be more accurate in classifying exposure. Any misclassification from single measures Appendix 4- 2004, age Outcome Definition: Thyroid disease= ever self-reported health professional diagnosis and current diagnosis and currently taking medication for the disease (CURRENT).

Q1 and Q3 v. Q1 P <0.05, but not Q4). For asthma ever Q2 v. Q1 is statistically significant (p<0.05) but not for other quartile. For other disease in which the percentage of 'disease' become increasingly minimal: COPD (11.2-11.9%), Diabetes (7.0-10.9%), Heart disease (5.4-5.7%), and Liver disease (0.8-1.4%) there are no significant findings. would tend to decrease power and underestimate the real strengths of association. Cross sectional design precludes causal inference. Confounding is also possible but unlikely. Since associations reported were in people on thyroid medications, which mimic normal thyroid function, reverse causation implausible.

Covariates and confounders considered include age, BMI, alcohol use, and cigarette use. PFOA serum concentrations were divided into four categories (0-1, 1-<10, and >=30 ppm). Outcome: Hormones (reproductive mainly) Major Findings: (Description is limited since endpoints are not being comprehensively reviewed). \"Simple linear regression of the natural log of each hormone with PFOA, treated as a continuous variable, resulted in no statistically significant coefficients in 1993 for any hormone and only one in 1995 (17-HP). \" These findings were the same for the multivariable regression also. Univariate analysis (1995) - Sta tistically increased mean for TSH between 1-<10 and 10-<30 ppm groups (p=0.002), but not for highest PFOA category. Findings were not statistically significant for 1993 but mean TSH increased for the 10-<30 category compared to the lower two categories.

Location: WV and OH, USA Population: Community member cohort (recruited from C8 Health Project participants (>20 years of age)), n = 28,541and plant workers in mid-Ohio River Valleys (recruited from a previous occupational mortality study cohort of people who worked at the chemical plant during 1948-2002), n = 3,713, n=32,254 total Outcome Definition: Self-reported health professional diagnosis- Questionnaire of demographics, health-related behaviors, and lifetime personal medical history, completed 2008-2010 and 2010-2011. Exposure Assessment: Yearly estimated serum PFOA concentrations starting at birth of 1952, whichever came later. Estimates of yearly air and drinking water PFOA exposure using an environmental fate and transport model were developed. Additional information for community estimates includes residential history and drinking water consumption rates and sources. For workers an occupational exposure model was used, after work, they were decayed until they met the community exposure models. Population-Level Exposure: Median 2005-06 = 26.1 ng/mL Median concentrations highest in late 1990s-ear ly 2000s Stat Method: Cox proportional hazard models (survival analysis), stratified by birth year. Covariates and confounders considered include sex, race, education, smoking and alcohol use. Primary models considered patterns of hazard ratios across quintiles of each exposure metric. In tests for trend, natural log-transformed PFOA concentration estimates were used. Retrospective analyses used deciles to explore dose-response curve shape. Outcome: Functional thyroid disease (n=2,323) Major Findings: Primary retrospective analysis: Quintile HR 1 1 2 1.21 3 1.12 4 1.27 5 1.28 HR log g/ml*yr = 1.03, p-value=0.09 The trend was more pronounced among women (HR per log g/ml*yr = 1.04, p- value=0.03), but was absent among men (HR per log g/ml*yr = 1.01, p-value=0.85). Major Limitations: Healthy worker effect for worker cohort Population in study area changed over time, no way to identify and include all residents over exposure period. Potential bias if exposure and thyroid conditions were correlated with migration or participation in original C8 study, Possible changes in population susceptibility over time, Potential error in exposure estimates (would bias towards null), Exclusion of people who reported thyroid disease with no type specified, Potential impact of differential access to care (w/r/t thyroid diagnoses) Funding Source: C8 Class Action Settlement between DuPont and Plaintiffs Appendix 4- page 72Medical records were reviewed to confirm diagnosis. Functional thyroid disease defined as a report of goiter, Graves' disease, hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's disease, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis not otherwise specified, or a thyroid function problem of unknown type. Hyperthyroidism defined as report of hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease. Hypothyroidism defined as report of hypothyroidism or Hashimoto's disease.

Prospective analysis, Bayesian calibration: N o clear associations with both sexes combined (smaller number of cases. There was a suggestion of an increasing hazard of function thyroid disease with increasing cumulative exposure among men (p- value=0.09). Outcome: Hypothyroidism (n=1,655) Major Findings: A trend for increasing hazards with increasing exposure was suggested for both hypothyroidism in relation to cumulative exposure (although log-linear trend p-values were > 0.05). For men considering the cumulative and yearly exposure metrics, and measured PFOA - HR per log g/ml*yr = 1.24 P=0.021. And for prospective analyses. Outcome: Hyperthyroidism (n=456) Major Findings: A trend for increasing hazards with increasing exposure was suggested for both. Log-linear trend p-value < 0.05, overall and for women.

Estimates of yearly air and drinking water PFOA exposure using an environmental fate and transport model were developed. Additional information for community estimates includes residential history and drinking water consumption rates and sources. For workers an occupational exposure model was used, after work, they were decayed until they met the community exposure models. Population-Level Exposure: Median measured in 2005-06: 26.1 ng/mL (24.2 community, 112.7 worker) Stat Method: Cox proportional hazard models (survival analysis), stratified by birth year. Covariates and confounders considered include sex, race, education, smoking and alcohol use, BMI, self-reported diabetes type 2, family history of coronary disease. Retrospective analyses started at the late of age 20 years or the age in 1952. Prospective analyses started at the participant's age 1 year after enrollment in the C8 Health Project (2005-2006). Primary exposure metric was a measure of cumulative PFOA (sum of all yearly serum concentration estimates). To look at short term effects, secondary analyses looked at yearly concentrations of PFOA estimates. Primary analyses considered the exposure by quintiles. Log of cumulative or yearly concentrations was used for a test of trend. All analyses performed overall and by age strata. Sensitivity analysis examining only community cohort.

Data for organ weights is not shown or discussed. It is stated that there was an increase in testis to body weight ratio in the 100 ppm recovery group that was not statistically significant. It is assumed that no effects were seen on these parameters for other organs or other t reatment groups, although this is not stated. It is stated that histopathology of tissues from treated groups (other than liver) did not differ from controls.

Test article and vehicle: Ammonium perfluorooctanoate (95.2% pure; impurities included perfluorhexanoate, Vehicle was gelatin capsule. Route of exposure: Oral in capsule. Exposure levels: 0, 3, 10, and 30/20 mg/kg/day (30 mg/kg/day suspended on Day 12, resumed at 20 mg/kg/day on Day 22 due to toxicity at higher level). Exposure regimen: Daily for at least 26 weeks. Recovery animals observed for 13 weeks following 26 weeks dosing Group size: Control - 4 plus 2 recovery. 3 mg/kg/day - 4 10 mg/kg/day - 4 plus 2 recovery 30/20 mg/kg/day - 6 (Note: some animals did not complete the study.) Note: Results presented here focus primarily on hepatic effects, since this endpoint has been the focus of other evaluations and risk assessments based on this study. A summary of the entire study is presented in the text. Animals sacrificed or removed from study before end of dosing period x Low dose (3 mg/kg/day) group : In this group, 3 monkeys were dosed for the full 26 week study period. A monkey in this group (which entered the study on Day 17 to replace another monkey which died of an infection) was sacrificed in moribund condition on day 137,, having lost 10% of its body weight in one week and showing other signs of toxicity, and this mortality was possibly treatment-related. The relative liver weight of this monkey (2.37%) was much higher than for the others in this dosing group, and was comparable to those in the high dose (30/20 mg/kg/day) group. x High dose group (30/20 mg/kg/day) : In this group, 2 monkeys were dosed for the full 26 week study period. One monkey in this group was sacrificed in moribund condition on Day 29, having lost 12.5% of its body weight and showing other signs of toxicity, and this death was considered likely to be treatment-related. Dosing was stopped for 3 other monkeys on Days 43, 66, and 81 due to dramatic weight loss, and low or no food consumption and feces. Body weight x Similar in the control, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day groups (19-20% during 26 wk study period). x In high dose (30/20 mg/kg/day) group, one of 2 monkeys that completed the study had weight gain similar to controls (18%) and the other lost 5% of body weight.

Same data at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day is not stated to be statistically significant in Butenhoff et al. (2002) . dIncludes data from monkey sacrificed in moribund condition on Day 137. Relative liver weight of this monkey was 2.37 % of body weight. eFrom Butenhoff et al. (2002).The results of this study are of limited use in risk assessment because of the small number of animals per group, the heterogeneity of the monkeys (e.g. widely different ages, potential for having been exposed to other chemicals in previous studies, etc.), possible treatment-related mortality in the low dose group, and because internal dose of PFOA (levels in serum and liver) did not differ in the low and mid-dose groups. Only two high dose monkeys completed the study, while 4 were sacrificed and/or removed due to toxicity. The 2 high dose animals that completed the study appeared to react very differently to PFOA. One monkey gained weight similarly to those in the control and lower dose groups, and its liver PFOA concentration was also similar to the low dose groups. The other monkey lost weight during the study and its PFOA liver concentration was about 4-fold higher than that of any other high dose monkey completing the study. Because of the potential mortality at the low dose, and the fact that the serum and liver PFOA levels did not differ the low and mid doses, the results of this study Appendix 5- page 86Reference and Study Design Results Comment Six month oral capsule study in Cynomolgus monkeys.

Effect of PFOA on maternal liver on GD18 z Tabular data. Absolute and relative maternal liver weight increased significantly and to a similar degree in all 3 strains.

(2007). They conclude that this effect occurs only in WT mice, but not in PPAR alpha null (KO) or humanized PPAR alpha (H) mice, and that this suggests a strain difference in developmental toxicity of PFOA. z They also conclude that PFOA did not affect MG development in WT, KO, or H mice at the single dose tested. However, there are several issues with the data and presentation of this study that are problematic and that limit the consideration of its results. x The study used only one dose of PFOA, and it is unclear whether that dose was sufficient to cause developmental toxicity in the WT strain. For this reason, the basis for the conclusion that WT, but not H, mice are sensitive to developmental effects of PFOA is uncertain. x It is stated in the text that elevated PFOA levels (up to > 1000 ng/ml) were found in liver and serum from some control fetuses, pups, and dams. However, no further information as to which groups of animals these samples came from, how many samples were elevated, or statistics for serum levels in the control samples is provided. Data from control animals with elevated PFOA exposures were not excluded from the comparisons of endpoints of toxicity in control and treated groups. Including the data from these control animals could have affected the results of the study, especially since serum levels in some of the treated groups were only a few fold higher than those in some of the controls. x The serum PFOA data for WT dams on PND 20 appear to be inconsistent within the paper. Maternal serum levels in WT dams on PND 20 are stated to range from 2066 - 6812 ng/ml. No statistical parameters (e.g. median, mean, S.D.) are provided numerically. However, the estimated serum level from the bar graph of maternal serum levels is 6700+3600 in WT (higher than what would be expected from the range provided in the text).

This conclusion appears to be based on an invalid statistical comparison. See comments. z Text states that no post-natal lethality was seen in WT dosed with 0.6 or 1 mg/kg/day PFOA, but numerical data for this effect and serum levels at these doses are not provided. Effect of PFOA on pup liver on PND20 z Pup liver weight on PND 20 increased in WT, but not KO or H (n not provided; bar graph). z Microscopic changes consistent with peroxisome proliferation in WT livers on PND 20 (n not stated). Equivocal evidence of centrilobular hypertrophy in 1/5 KO pup livers on PND 20.

Number of pups per litter on PND 20 in the control and PFOA-treated groups of WT mice were compared. However, this comparison does not appear to be valid because the control and PFOA treated litters had different numbers of pups on PND 0. This parameter should be evaluated by comparing number of pups in the same litter on PND 0 and PND 20 (i.e. percent mortality within the litter between PND 0 and PND 20). In WT pups, 96% of controls and 70% of PFOA-treated survived from PND 0 to PND 20. From the analysis presented, it is unclear whether post-natal lethality was actually significantly increased by PFOA in WT pups. x The authors note that PFOA serum levels in this study are lower than in the same strain of WT mice given comparable PFOA doses in Abbott et al. (2007). For example, the WT maternal serum PFOA levels on PND 20 are comparable to those in WT dams similarly dosed with lower levels of PFOA (0.3 - 1 mg/kg/day) in Abbott et al (2007). Although both studies used SV/129 mice, this study obtained them from NIH and Abbott et al. (2007) obtained them from Jackson Laboratories. The authors suggest that pharmacokinetic differences in the mice used may explain the differences in effects of PFOA in WT mice in the two studies. However, a close review of the data from the two studies indicates that Albrecht et al. (2013) did not observe developmental effects of PFOA in WT pups that were seen at similar or lower PFOA levels in WT mice by Abbott et al. (2007). Abbott et al. (2007) reported significantly increased post-natal lethality in WT pups exposed gestationally to 0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day PFOA. In both of these dose groups, pup survival to PND 22 was 43%. WT pup serum levels on PND 22 in the 0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day dose groups in Abbott et al. (2007) were 3810 and 9860 ng/ml (respectively). PFOA serum PND 22 Appendix 5-B1- page 90Reference and Study Design Results Comment Albrecht et al. (2013). (continued) PFOA LEVELS IN SERUM AND LIVERS FROM DAMS, FETUSES, AND PUPS z Dams - n=5 per strain on GD18 and PND 20. Fetuses and pups - n= 7-25 fetuses or pups from 3 - 7 litters on GD 18 and PND 20. It is not clear if this represents 7-25 fetuses/pups altogether at each time point or 7-25 pups per strain at each time point. z Text states that PFOA levels from control dams, fetuses, and pups ranged from <5 to 1060 ng/ml in liver and from <5 to 1370 ng/ml in serum. This is described as a \"small cohort\" of samples, and it is stated that concentrations in control samples \"typically\" were ND (<5 ng/ml). However, the number/percentage of control samples with elevated levels (including how many from fetuses, pups, and dams), and data or statistics on the levels found in controls, are not provided numerically or in bar graphs. Additionally, the data on endpoints of toxicity from control animals with elevated PFOA levels were not excluded from the analysis (see comments). z Maternal serum levels in WT dams on PND 20 are stated to range from 2066 - 6812 ng/ml. No statistics (median, mean, S.D., etc.) are provided numerically. However, the estimated serum level from the bar graph of maternal serum level s is 6700+3600 in WT (higher than what would be expected from the range provided in the text). The WT maternal serum PFOA levels on PND 20 are comparable to those in WT dams similarly dosed with lower levels of PFOA (0.3 - 1 mg/kg/day) in Abbott et al (2007). See comments. z In dams, serum PFOA levels were lower in WT than in KO or H on GD 18, and were higher in WT than KO or H on PND 22 (shown in bar graph).). z In pups and fetuses, PFOA serum levels were higher in H than in KO or WT on GD 18, and were lower in H than in KO or WT on PND 22. Liver PFOA levels in dams, pups, and fetuses did not necessarily follow the same relative pattern among strains as serum PFOA. in Albrecht et al. (2013; this study) are estimated as 10,000 ng/ml (presented in bar graph), yet post-natal mortality (70% survival to PND 20) was much lower than in Abbott et al. (2007) and may not be statistically significant (see above). Similarly, eye opening was significantly delayed in the 0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day WT pups in Abbott et al. (2007) but not in the treated pups with similar and higher PFOA serum levels in Albrecht et al. (2013). z In summary, this study is problematic for several reasons. The inclusion of data from controls with elevated PFOA exposures may have influenced the comparisons of effects in control and treated groups. Important data on serum levels is not presented or is presented inconsistently. It is unclear whether post-natal mortality actually was significantly increased in WT pups, and the delayed eye opening seen in WT pups in Abbott et al. (2007) was not observed. The differences in developmental effects in WT pups in Albrecht et al. (2013) versus Abbott et al. (2007) cannot be explained on the basis of pharmacokinetic differences in the two studies, since effects were seen at pup serum levels in Abbott et al. (2007) that are lower than the pup serum levels in Albrecht et al. (2013). For these reasons, the conclusion that developmental toxicity occurs in WT mice but not humanized PPAR-alpha mice, indicating that humans may be less sensitive to developmental toxicity of PFOA, is not clearly supported by this study. In this study, no effect on mammary gland development was reported in pups from the 3 strains on PND 20. The effects of PFOA on mammary gland development in SV/129 mice have not been evaluated in other studies. It is possible that this strain may be less sensitive to this effect than the other strains in which it has been reported. However, the general issues with this study discussed above create uncertainty about its conclusions, including those related to mammary gland development.

Terminal end buds persisted at PND 63 and 84 (9 and 12 weeks), while normally they differentiate into terminal structures starting at PND 63 and disappear by PND 84. At PND 84, epithelial branching did not fil l the fat pads as completely as in the controls. The decreases were statistically significant at all doses on PND 14 and 21, at 1 and 3 mg/kg /day on PND 28, at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day on PND 42, and at 0.3 and 2.2 mg/kg/day on PND 84, while other decreases were not significantly significant, possibly due to the small numbers (n=2-6) for each data point. zT he LOAEL for delayed MG development was 0.3 mg/kg/day, and a NOAEL was not identified.

The LOAEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day and no NOAEL was identified. Delays were evident, and were statistically significant (with the exception of the 3 mg/kg/day dose group with n of only 2), at the end of the study on PND 84. In the late gestation exposure study (exposure on GD 10-17 to 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg/day), individual parameters of MG development were evaluated in addition to the overall developmental score used in the full gestation study and earlier studies from this laboratory (White et al., 2007, 2009, 2011). MG development, based on numerous endpoints, was assessed in female pups on PND 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21. The authors state that the mammary glands from the treated mice displayed aberrant morphology, with delays most evident on PND 21. Only PND 21 data are shown in tabular form and some PND 14 data are presented in the text, while data from other time points are not shown. On PND 21, the overall developmental score was significantly decreased in all dose groups compared to controls in a dose- related fashion.

Relative liver weight increased (p< 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001) in 1 mg/kg/day group on PND 4 - PND 14. No effect in 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg/day groups. z NOAEL for increased relative liver weight based on PFOA serum level - In the 1 mg/kg/day group during the period when liver weight was increased, serum PFOA levels were 16,305 ng/ml on PND 1 and decreased to 6084 ng/ml on PND 14. The NOAEL for increased relative liver weight was 2303 ng/ml, the highest serum level in the 0.1 mg/kg/day group, which occurred on PND 1. T his is consistent with the serum level in the 1 mg/kg/day group on PND 21 (when liver weight was no longer increased), which was 2683 ng/ml. PFOA levels in serum, liver, and brain Numerical data are presented for serum, liver, and brain in M & F pups in the full gestational (GD 1-17) study. Data from PND 7 (earliest time point assessed) shows that serum levels were similar in M&F pups, with slightly higher values at all doses in males. Seru m levels in the late gestational (GD 10-17) study are for combined M&F pups on PND 1, and for F pups at other times. Serum data for late gestational study (exposure on PND 10-17) shown below . PND 21 in all treated groups in a dose-related fashion, but were significant only for change in longitudinal growth and number of terminal end buds in the highest dose group (possibly due to the small n (3- 5) at each dose. There were no effects on body weight, and liver weight was not affected at 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg/day. Serum levels were highest in the treated pups on PND 1 and had decreased to 6-12% of the PND 1 levels by PND 21. The serum level on PND 1 in the 0.01 mg/kg/day group was 285 ng/ml. Serum levels in the dams were not measured but are expected to be similar to those in the pups. Serum levels in non-pregnant adult CD-1 mice exposed to 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day for 8 days were 3200, and 31,000 ng/ml, from preliminary data of Das et al. (2010), and the serum level after dosing with 0.01 mg/kg/day for 8 days can be estimated at 320 ng/ml from these data. Earlier studies showed pup serum levels 2-fold or less higher than maternal serum levels at PND 1. Thus, levels in the dams at delivery would also be expected to be around 300 ng/L or less in the 0.01 mg/kg/day group. Summary: Gestational exposure to > 0.01 mg/kg/day PFOA caused dose- related delays in MG development in female offspring. MG development was delayed by doses that did not Appendix 5-B1- page 93Reference and Study Design Results Comment Macon et al. (2011) (cont.)

The LOAEL for delayed MG development in the pups is a serum level of 285 ng/ml (measured) and is also estimated as about 300 ng/ml or lower in the dams, and no NOAEL was identified. This LOAEL is based on the serum level on PND 1, and the actual LOAEL may be lower, since effects occurred at later time points when serum levels had decreased. These findings indicate that delayed mammary gland development is a more sensitive endpoint for PFOA's effects in female mouse pups than decreased body weight or increased liver weight.

Species and strain: Timed pregnant CD-1 and C57Bl/6 mice and their offspring MG Assessment: Female offspring Test article and vehicle: PFOA (ammonium salt, >98% pure) in deionized water Route of exposure: Oral gavage Exposure levels: 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, or mg/kg/day Exposure regimen: Gestational. GD 1-17. Group size: CD-1: 3 blocks of pregnant dams (n=97, 40, and 26) C57Bl/6: 41 pregnant dams PND and PND 61 MG DEVELOPMENT MG development scores (1-4) in whole mounts from CD-1 and C57Bl/6 on GD 1-17 ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. Means represent averages of individual pup scores. z Authors report that delayed MG development was apparent at lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg/day) in both strains. z MG development scores were lower than controls at all doses, including lowest (0.01 mg/kg/day) and timepoints in both strains. z Lack of significance in C57Bl/6 at lower doses may be due to lower PFOA serum levels and smaller n, as compared to CD-1. z Specific observations indicating delayed MG development at different time points in each strain are described in the text. z Delayed MG development persisted through early adulthood (end of study) in both strains. OTHER ENDPOINTS Body weight: Assessed at same time points as MG development. No effect on absolute body weight. Body weight with liver weight subtracted decreased (p<0.05) only in 1 mg/kg/day CD-1 on PND 21 and PND 35, but not PND 56. Liver weight: Assessed at same time points as MG development. No effects on absolute liver weight. Relative liver weight incre ased (p<0.05) on Pubertal events: PFOA treatment had no effect on day of vaginal opening, body weight at vaginal opeing, or day of first estrus in either strain. Serum estradiol and progesterone: Assessed at same time points as MG development. PFOA treatment had no effect on hormone levels at any time point in either strain. MG development was delayed on PND 21 until PND 56 or 61 in CD-1 and C57Bl/6 mice exposed 0.01- 1 mg/kg/day PFOA on GD 1-17. No NOAEL for delayed MG development was identified in CD-1 mice. The results in CD-1 mice are consistent with delayed MG development after exposure to 0.01 mg/kg/day and higher doses on GD 10-17 (Macon et al., 2011). Lack of significant effects at lower doses in C57Bl6 mice as compared to CD-1 mice may be due the small number of mice per dose group and/or lower serum levels (faster excretion) in C57Bl/6. Serum PFOA levels were first measured on PND 21. After gestational exposure, PFOA serum levels in CD-1 mice were highest on PND 1 and decreased thereafter (Macon et al., 2011). Since the effects seen on PND 21 and later times could be the result of higher internal doses earlier in life, these serum data are not suitable as the basis for quantitative risk assessment. Summary: Delayed MG development in both strains occurred in the absence of effects on body weight, liver weight, timing of pubertal events, and serum estradiol and progesterone. This suggests that MG development is a more sensitive endpoint for effects of PFOA than the other endpoints assessed. Appendix 5-B1- page 95Reference and Study Design Results Comment Tucker et al. (2015) (cont.) PFOA SERUM LEVELS (ng/ml) z Serum PFOA levels in both strains increased with dose and decreased over time. z Serum PFOA was below LOQ or very low (9-27 ng/L) at some doses and time points when MG development was significantly delayed. z Serum PFOA levels were lower in C57Bl/6 than CD-1 mice on PND 21, and generally lower at later time points (PND 56 in CD-1 versus PND 61 in C57Bl/6).

Representative H&E slides from control and treated mice are shown. x PND 10: MG development was delayed in all exposure groups (significant for GD 8-17 and 1-17). x PND 20: MG in all PFOA-exposed groups resembled MG from PND 10 controls, indicating delayed development. MG Development Score in Whole Mounts (mean + SE) Control females dosed with PFOA for up to 17 days have no effects on MG (data not shown) Expression of milk proteins Gene expression profiles of four milk protein genes (beta-casein, EGF, alpha-Lac, and LactoF) in maternal mammary gland tissue on PND 10 and 20 showed that expression of genes for all 4 proteins was significantly (p<0.05 or p<0.001) or in at least one exposure group (GD 12-17, 8-17, and 1-17) on PND 10 and/or PND 20. S ome of the changes did not follow a consistent pattern.Study 1 The authors interpreted the delayed MG development in treated dams on PND 18 (prior to parturition) as indicating that the delayed MG development in dams at later time points in Study 2 was not due to a deficiency in stimulation of lactation due to decreased suckling ability of pups. Study 2 Lactating dams on PND 10 and 20 MG development in lactating dams Delayed MG development in dams occurred in the absence of decreased maternal weight gain. Exposure during the second half of pregnancy was sufficient to cause this effect. MG development in non-pregnant females was not affected by similar exposures. On PND 10, normally the peak of lactation in rodents, MG from treated mice on PND 10 resembled those normally seen earlier in lactation. On PND 20, immediately prior to weaning, MG are normally involuted, but MG from PFOA-treated mice resembled PND 10 (peak of lactation) MG from controls. This suggests a delay of up to 10 days in MG differentiation due to PFOA exposure. Expression of milk proteins in lactating dams The authors stated that the decrease in LactoF at PND 20, when a peak normally occurs, is consistent with the observed structural delays in mammary gland development seen at PND 20. Decreased pup body weight at birth The authors state that this effect was not due to general maternal toxicity, since maternal body weight and reproductive parameters were not affected. MG development in female offspring Delayed MG development occurred after exposure during the final 6 days of gestation. MG development was arrested between PND 10 and 20, although pups grew isometrically during this time period. Appendix 5-B1- page 97Reference and Study Design Results Comments White et al.

LactoF levels in the treated groups on PND 20 were similar to the controls on PND 10. Female Offspring on PND 10 or PND 20 (Study 2) Whole mounts were examined microscopically and scored on a scale of 1-4. All treated groups were prenatally exposed to 5 mg/kg/day on stated gestational days (GD). x MG development was delayed (p<0.001) in all groups at both time points. x MG development was not correlated with body weight. x Virtually no MG development occurred in treated pups between PND 10 and 20, although relative body weight gain was not decreased in treated pups during this period. x PFOA serum levels in serum and liver decreased from PND 10 to PND 20, but MG development remained arrested.

PFOA serum levels in these dams was about 2000 ng/ml on PND 3, presumably from exposure through maternal behavior such as grooming of pups and ingestion of waste excreted by pups.

Relative liver weight not affected with lactation only exposure (5L group) .Of fspring MG development was delayed in female offspring after gestational and/or lactational exposure. MG development delay in female offspring occurred at timepoints at which body weight was not decreased and/or relative liver weight was not increased, suggesting that MG development may be a more sensitive endpoint in offspring than decreased growth or increased relative liver weight. MG development delay occurred as early as PND 1, including in PND 1 female offspring exposed only lactationally with less than 1 day of exposure and serum levels of ~2000 ng/ml. MG development delay in female offspring persisted until PND 63 (9 weeks) after gestational and/or lactational exposure. At this time point, serum levels were <1000 ng/ml in treated groups, and as low as 350 ng/ml. MG developmental deficits after gestational and/or lactational exposure persisted until age 18 months, a time point when PFOA had essentially been completed eliminated from the body. Exposure on GD 15-17, or longer portions of gestation, caused MG development delay in female offspring on PND 29 and 32, and persistent changes in MG morphology at age 18 months.

Dams MG development was profoundly delayed in treated dams on PND 1, and delays persisted until PND 10. MG development was also delayed beginning on PND 3 in untreated dams with exposure through nursing of treated pups.

Higher MG development scores of whole mounts in all treated P0 dams and 5 mg/kg/day F1 dams on PND 22 is indicative of delayed MG development. In these treated dams, MG at PND 22, when MG involution is normally seen at weaning, resembled normal MG on PND 10, the peak of lactation. This is consistent with observations in MG from these animals in H&E stained slides. Results are also consistent with White et al. (2007), but also occurred in this study after 34 days of exposure to 5 ppb in drinking water. - In the F1 female pups , MG development was significantly delayed in all dosed groups including 5 ug/L in drinking water at PND 22, 42, and 63. MG development was delayed in 5 ppb drinking water group in the absence of effects on body weight or relative liver weight at any timepoint, indicating that it is a more sensitive endpoint. The PFOA serum levels in the F1 pups exposed to 5 ppb in drinking water ranged from 21.3 ng/ml on PND 22 to 66.2 ng/ml on PND 63 (compared to 0.6 and 3.1 ng/ml, respectively, at these times in the controls). Thus the LOAEL for delayed mammary gland development in the F1 pups is 21.3 ng/ml (the level on PND 22), and no NOAEL was identified. - In the F1 dams that were bred at 7-8 weeks of age, MG development was significantly delayed in all treated groups on PND 10 and in the 1 mg/kg/day + 5 ppb drinking water group on PND 22. Maternal toxicity (effects on reproductive parameters) occurred only in the 5 mg/kg/day group. These MG development delays are consistent with the delayed MG development in the virgin F1 siblings up to PND 63, the latest time point assessed (see above). Appendix 5-B1- page 102 White et al.

Body weight only in 5 ppb in drinking water group on PND 1 (p<0.05). z Body weight (or body weight excluding liver weight) at a few timepoints in 1 mg/kg/day (with or without 5 ppb in drinking water) groups (p<0.05). z Relative liver weight was not affected. PFOA SERUM LEVELS z Serum levels assessed in P0 and F1 dams on PND 22; in F1 and F2 female offspring on PND 22, 42, and 63. z Serum levels in dams exposed only to 5 ppb in drinking water were 75-87 ng/mL. Serum levels in F1 and F2 offspring were 21-69 ng/ml. - In the lactational challenge experiment with F1 dams and F2 litters on PND 10, milk produced in 30 minutes was decreased, and time to initiate nursing behavior was increased, in all treated groups compared to controls. However, none of the changes were statistically significant, possibly due to high variability and the small number of animals assessed. Additionally, postnatal survival and body weight were not affected in the treated F2 offspring, suggesting that the ability of the F1 dams to provide nutritional support was not decreased. However, it is not known if there were deficits in lactational function that were compensated for by increased frequency or longer duration of nursing events, since these parameters were not assessed. - The F2 pups showed a trend toward delayed mammary gland development, with decreased scores in all treated groups compared to controls at all time points (PND 10, 22, 42, and 63) except for the 5 ug/L drinking water group on PND 63. However, decreases were statistically significant only on PND 42 in the 5 ppb drinking water group and the 1 mg/kg/day + 5 ppb drinking water groups, and on PND 63 in the 1 mg/kg/day group. Serum levels in F2 pups exposed to 5 ppb in drinking water were 26.6 to 68.5 ng/ml, similar to the F1 pups with the same exposure (see above). In the F2 pups which were the offspring of dams exposed during development to 1 mg/kg/day or 5 mg/kg/day, but not exposed later through drinking water, serum levels at the various time points (PND 22, 42, and 63) ranged from 0.4 ng/ml (below controls) to 7.8 ng/ml. Summary: Chronic exposure to 5 ppb PFOA in drinking water caused delayed MG development in both P0 and F1 dams and F1 and F2 offspring. MG development was delayed by exposure to 5 ppb in drinking water at all timepoints in F1 offspring and on PND 42 in F2 offspring. Delayed MG development was a more sensitive endpoint than decreased body weight in dams and offspring, reproductive effects in dams, and increased liver weight in offspring. The LOAEL based on serum PFOA levels for delayed MG development in the F1 pups is 21.3 ng/ml (the level on PND 22). No NOAEL was identified in this study. Appendix 5-B1- page 103White et al.

Since # of TEBs/stimulated TDs was at 5 mg/kg/day, results indicate overall in MG epithelial cell proliferation at this dose. After peripubertal exposure to PFOA, MG development was delayed at 1-10 mg/kg/day in Balb/C mice. In C57BL/6 mice, MG development was stimulated at 1 and 5 mg/kg/day and delayed at 10 mg/kg/day. The range of serum PFOA levels was similar in the two strains of mice within the dose ranges mentioned above. The dose-response curve for MG development in the C57Bl/6 mice was non-monotonic, and the change from a large stimulatory effect to a large inhibitory effect occurred within a relatively small range of serum PFOA levels (68 g/ml to 96 g/ml). . Uterine development followed a similar pattern of delay/simulation as MG development in the two strains. However, in C57BL/6, stimulation of uterine development occurred at 1 mg/kg/day but not 5 mg/kg/day. Vaginal opening was delayed at all doses in both strains. Liver weight was increased at all doses in both strains. In this study, PFOA exposure was during the peripubertal period, while exposure was prenatal and/or neonatal in White et al., 2007, 2009, 2011; Macon et al., 2011; and Tucker et al., 2015. PFOA serum levels from this study are not reported in this publication, but are reported in Zhao et al. (2012). Appendix 5-B2- page 105Reference & Study Design Results Comment Yang et al. (2009).

MAMMARY GLAND DEVELOPMENT MG development in whole mounts from female 7 week old Balb/C, C57BL/6 WT, and C57BL/6 PPAR-null (KO) mice treated with PFOA for 4 weeks ( SEE ALSO SUMMARY TABLE AND GRAPH OF 3 STUDIES FROM THIS LAB BELOW ) Treatment (mg/kg/day) PFOA serum level (ng/ml)a Ductal Length (relative units) # Terminal End Buds (TEBs) # Stimulated Terminal Ducts (TDs) Absolute MG Weight (g) Relative MG Weight (%) Balb/c 0 -- 8.17 \u00b1 1.08 1.90 7.02 \u00b1 2.16 0.14\u00b10.026 0.78\u00b10.11 *p<0.05 compared to control. n=5 per strain per dose group. a Levels estimated from bar graph. n = 5 per group. z Doses of PFOA (2.5 mg/kg/day in Balb/C mice and 7.5 mg/kg/day in WT and KO mice) were chosen because they were lower than the LOAELs for delayed MG development in Balb/C (5 mg/kg/day) and WT (10 mg/kg/day) strains in the previous study (Yang et al., 2009). The goal was to further study the delayed MG development caused by PFOA in these strains. z MG development was inhibited in Balb/C and WT mice, and was not affected in KO mice, by the PFOA doses used in this study.. In Balb/C mice, the PFOA serum level and the MG development delay at 2.5 mg/kg/day were intermediate to the serum PFOA levels and MG development delays at 1 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day in this strain in Yang et al. (2009). In WT mice, the PFOA serum level (93,000\u00b111,000 ng/ml) at 7.5 mg/kg/day in this study is very close to the PFOA serum level at 10 mg/kg/day (96,000\u00b110,000 ng/ml) in the earlier study (Yang et al., 2009). MG development was delayed at both of these doses in these two studies. The serum level (68,000\u00b110,000 ng/ml) at which MG development was reported to be greatly stimulated in Yang et al . (2009) is relatively close to the serum levels where MG development was delayed. In KO mice, PFOA (7.5 mg/kg/day) did not affect MG development. However, serum PFOA levels in KO mice (38,000 \u00b1 7000 ng/ml) were much lower than the serum level where MG was inhibited in WT mice. It is stated that in KO mice treated with 10 mg/kg/day, the serum levels were similar to those at 7.5 mg/kg/day and there was no effect on MG development (data not shown). Because the ser um levels in KO mice were lower than those in WT mice where MG development was delayed, no conclusions about PPAR-alpha dependence of delayed MG development can be made from these data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects on MG development from peripubertal exposure to doses lower than those that caused delayed MG development in Balb/C and C57Bl/6 WT mice in an earlier study (Yang et al., 2009). Effects in PPAR-alpha null mice were also studied. In Balb/C mice, inhibition of MG development occurred at 2.5 mg/kg/day, lower than the LOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day identified in Yang et al.(2009). In C57BL/6 WT mice, inhibition of MG development occurred at 7.5 mg/kg/day, lower than the LOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day identified in Yang et al. (2009). In Yang et al. (2009), 5 mg/kg/day was reported to stimulate MG development in this strain. In C57BL/6 PPAR alpha null (KO) mice, 7.5 mg/kg/day PFOA had no effect on MG development. Lack of inhibition of MG development in C57Bl/6 KO, as compared to the other two strains, in this study, may be due to kinetic factors unrelated to PPAR status. PFOA serum levels in KO mice were below the serum levels at which MG development was delayed in the other two strains of mice.

(2010). z PFOA had no effect on absolute or relative weight of mammary glands/fat pads. x Absence of corpus lutea and ut erine changes in Balb/C and WT stated to be in dicative of absence of estrous cycling. MG development in whole mounts from 5 week old Ba lb/C and C57BL/6 WT mice after 2 weeks of PFOA treatment, with or without estradiol and/or progesterone treatment during final week z Balb/C mice were dosed with PFOA at 2.5 mg/kg/day, and WT mice with 7.5 mg/kg/day, for 2 weeks. KO mice were not included in this component of the study. z During the second week, 5 mice from PFOA-treated groups in each strain were either not treated with hormones, or dosed with estrogen (0.1 ug/mouse), progesterone (0.1 mg/mouse), or both, by subcutaneous injection. Data on effects of hormones in contro ls (no PFOA treatment) are not shown. These doses of hormones were stated to be physiological levels of these hormones. n=5 per group. Mice were sacrificed 24 hour s after last dose. z MG data are shown numerically for ductal length, number of TEBs, and absolute and relative mammary gland weight. z In mice from both strains that were not dosed with hormones, PFOA caused delayed MG development (decreased ductal length and number of TEBs), and there was no effect on MG weight. These results are consistent with the MG gland development delays at th e same administered doses in these strains of mice in the first component of study (above). Serum PFOA levels were not measured i n this second component of the study. z Hormone treatment (estradiol, progesterone, or both) prevented the delayed MG development caused by PFOA in both strains. Hormone treatment is stated to have no effect on MG development in mice not treated with PFOA (data not shown). Levels of growth factors, receptors, and cell proliferation marker in MG z MG levels of 2 growth factors (Areg and HGF alpha), two receptors (ER alpha and EGFR), and a cell proliferation marker (PCNA) were also assessed. z PFOA (in the absence of hormone treatment) decreased the levels of Areg, EGFR, and PCNA in both strains of mice compared to untreated control (n = 3 per group; data shown in bar graphs). Hormone treatment in mice dosed with PFOA (Balb/C and WT) increased the levels of these factors above those in untreated controls not given PFOA or hormones (p<0.05 for all effects). OTHER ENDPOINTS ( in 7 wk old mice after 4 wks of PFOA treatment (Balb/C - 7.5 mg/kg/day; WT & KO - 2.5 mg/kg/day)) Body weight: z PFOA treatment caused no significant effects except decrease (p<0.05) in WT treated with 7.5 mg/kg/day during 4th (last) week of dosing (n=5 per group). Data shown graphically. In Zhao et al. (2010), 5 mg/kg/day PFOA was reported to stimulate MG development similarly in KO and WT mice. The authors concluded that the stimulatory effect on MG development was PPAR alpha independent (Zhao et al., 2010). However, in Zhao et al. (2012) presented here, there was no effect on MG development in KO mice dosed with 7.5 mg/k/day at a PFOA serum level of 38 ppb (Zhao et al., 2012). This serum level is within the range of PFOA serum levels (26 to 68 ppb) at which MG development was stimulated in WT mice (Yang et al., 2009). Considering these data together, a definitive conclusion about whether the stimulation is PPAR-dependent or independent cannot be made. There are no numerical data or concurrent comparisons with WT for the single data point where stimulation in KO mice was reported. Alternatively, the dose- response for stimulation of MG development may be very different in KO mice than WT mice. Appendix 5-B2- page 108Reference & Study Design Results Comment Zhao et al. (2012). (continued) Day of vaginal opening, presence of corpus lutea in ovary, and uterine histology: z Vaginal opening data presented numerically, other information presented in text. n=5 per group. x PFOA treatment delayed vaginal opening in Balb/C and WT (p<0.05), but not KO. x PFOA prevented development of corpus lutea present in Balb/C and WT, but had no effect in KO. x PFOA caused thinning of uterine myometrium and endometrium thinned Balb/C and WT; no changes in KO. x Absence of corpus lutea and uterine changes in Balb/C and WT stated to be indicative of absenc e of estrous cycling. Levels of ovarian enzymes related to steroid hormone synthesis and PPAR a lpha z PFOA treatment in both Balb/C and WT mice decreased (p<0.05) levels of 4 ovarian enzymes related to synthesis of steroid hormones (StAR, CYP11A1, HSD3beta1, HSD17beta1) and had no effect on aromatase. PFOA did not affect these enzymes in KO mice (n=3 per group). z PFOA treatment did not affect ovarian PPAR alpha levels. Ovarian PPAR alpha was higher (p<0.05) in Balb/C (1.00 + 0.20) than WT (0.43 + 0.19), and was not measured in KO mice. Units not stated. MG levels of ovarian growth factors, receptors, and cell proliferation marker in Balb/C, WT, and KO mice z Levels of 3 growth factors (Areg, IGF-I, HGF), 2 receptors (ERalpha, EGFR), and the cell proliferation marker PCNA were assess ed in ovaries. (Data shown in bar graphs. n = 3 per group). z In Balb/C and WT mice, PFOA decreased 2 growth factor s (Areg and HGF), decreased both receptors (ERalpha, EGFR), (p<0.05) in Balb/C and PFOA had no effect on IGF-I. z PFOA had no effect on any parameter in KO mice. x These results are not consistent with the results in WT and KO mice dosed with 5 mg/kg/day PFOA for 4 weeks from Zhao et al. (2010). Ovarian levels of 3 growth fact ors (Areg, IGF-I, HGF), 2 rec eptors (ERalpha, proliferation marker s (cyclin D1, PCNA) were assessed (see above). x 5 mg/kg/day PFOA increased all 3 growth factors in KO mice and 2 growth factors in WT mice (1.5-2.7 fold, p<0.05); increased both receptors in WT and KO mice , and increased both markers of cell proliferation) in both WT and KO mice Estrogen and progesterone levels z It is not known if estrogen and progesterone levels were affected by PFOA treatment. The authors state that this could not be assessed due to insufficient numbers of animals in each stage of estrous. However, delayed vaginal opening, absence of corpus lutea, and abnormal uterine histology suggest abnormal ovarian function and decreased hormone levels. Kidney organic anion transporters (OATs): z Expression of 7 OATs was measured in kidneys from the three strains of mice (control and PFOA-treated). z In control & PFOA-treated mice, levels of 3 OATs were higher in KO than Balb/C, & 2 of these OATs were higher in WT than Balb/ C. z PFOA treatment did not affect levels of OATs expression. z This endpoint is of interest in evaluation of strain differences in serum PFOA levels from same administered dose, but is not directly relevant to the evaluation of effects of PFOA on MG development. Additionally, it is difficult to interpret the effects seen in Yang et al. (2009) and in this study in C57BL/6 WT mice because the dose-response between 5 and 7.5 mg/kg/day was not evaluated within the same study. The 5 and 10 mg/kg/day doses were not included along with 7.5 mg/kg/day dose in this study. The two doses and serum levels are close together (68 versus 93 g/ml), yet opposite effects on MG development (stimulation versus strong inhibition) were reported at the lower versus higher dose. This implies that that a very steep dose-response curve exists for stimulation versus inhibition, and that there is a dose between 5 and 7.5 mg/kg/day and a serum level between 68 and 93 g/ml where no effect occurs. These data cannot be validly interpreted in the absence of data at both doses from the same study. Similarly, it is difficult to interpret the opposite effects of PFOA at 5 versus 7.5 mg/kg/day on ovarian enzymes related to hormone synthesis, and MG growth factors, receptors, and markers of proliferation, since the data at each dose comes from a different study.

However, the AIC value indicates a reasonable fit. d The 3rd degree polynomial model over fits the data at the high doses (see graphic description). However, the fit at the lower doses (including the doses contributing most to the BMD and BMDL) appears appropriate Summary Both the exponential models (models 4 and 5 give identical fits) and the 3rd degree polynomial model give acceptable fits to these data. The 3rd degree polynomial model over fits the data at the high dose, forcing a fit and resulting in a biologically unlikely fit in this area of the dose- response. However, the fit of the model at the lower doses (i.e., in the range of the BMD) is regular and biologically appropriate. It is unlikely that the forced fit at the high dose has any significant influence on the fit of the model at the BMD. Although this model gives a slightly better fit than the exponential models and also yields a slightly lower BMDL, the exponential models give a highly comparable fit and a similar BMDL. As neither model appears to have a claim to greater biological significance, it is recommended that the point-of-departure be derived as the average of the BMDLs for both of these models.

This value is close to the 4% response at the lowest dose in this data set. The Gamma model (power restricted to \u0095\u0003\u0014 to this dataset and consequently yield identical BMDLs and cancer potency slopes. BMDLs and cancer potency estimate. These models were selected as most appropriate for deriving a cancer potency slope from these data. The Gamma model with power unrestricted; the Log-logistic model with power unrestricted; and the Weibull model with power unrestricted all fit the data exactly and yield very small BMDLs. However, despite their better fit of the data than the selected models, these models are not considered appropriate for derivation of a cancer potency slope from these data. This is because these models all assume a steep dose-response relationship at low doses which becomes much less steep at higher doses. The steepness of the dose-response at low doses (i.e., doses associated with a less than 5% response) leads to the very small BMDL values associated with these models. The steepness of the dose-response at low doses is a highly specific assumption which is not necessary and which is not dictated by any empirical or theoretical consideration. These models are therefore rejected. The Gamma, power restricted to \u0095\u0003\u0014, (and the other models giving essentially identical results) and the Log- ORJLVWLF\u0003PRGHO\u0003 ZLWK\u0003VORSH\u0003UHVWULFWHG\u0003WR\u0003\u0094\u0003\u0014 \u0003ILW\u0003WKH\u0003GDWD\u0003ZLWK \u0003YHU\\\u0003VLPLODU\u0003ILWV\u0003DQG\u0003 yield very similar BMDLs. Additionally, none of these models has a form that is obviously more biologically accurate. For these reasons, it is appropriate to average their BMDLs. The average BMDL for these models is 2.36 mg/kg/day. For a 5% BMR, the corresponding linear (no threshold) cancer potency slope is 0.021 (mg/kg/day) -, and the dose corresponding to a 1 x 10-6 risk is 4.8 x 10-5 mg/kg/day.
