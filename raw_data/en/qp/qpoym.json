Yet what initiallymotivated me to invest my life energies intothis work were my personal psychedelic andmarijuana experiences, and those of otherswho shared their stories with me. It\u00d5s these intensely personal narratives that can get lost in the details of this researchproject, that regulatory hurdle, this mediaarticle, that donation, each small step towardour larger goal of building a society matureenough to integrate psychedelics and mari-juana rather than prohibit and repress them. This special issue of the MAPS Bulletin on psychedelics and self-discovery is edited by JagDavies and Sarah Hufford. MAPS\u00d5 increasinguse of email updates and our website tocommunicate about our work in detail and ona timely basis creates this opportunity for us totake a short hiatus from using the Bulletin forreports about MAPS\u00d5 growing number ofpromising research and educational projects.This issue is an effort to bring to the fore-ground the experiences that often remain inthe background of MAPS\u00d5 work, to look inmore depth at what lies beneath the surface ofall our efforts. I\u00d5m writing now after returning from Israel. I traveled there with my family thistime, so my brother, my wife and I could showour three children and nephew their ancestralroots. We went on a lengthy search under theblazing sun in Jerusalem, looking for the graveof my great-great grandmother. She was buriedthere exactly 100 years ago, in 1907. She wasthe first of our relatives in modern times tomove there, which she did alone, leaving hergrown children behind. After finally locatingher grave on the Mt. of Olives, where Jews aretraditionally buried in expectation of beingfirst in line for the resurrection, I couldn\u00d5t helpbut wonder what she would think aboutMAPS\u00d5 Israeli psychedelic and marijuanaprojects. After all, I can\u00d5t quite see the point intrying to be first in line after the resurrection. While in Israel, I worked to prepare for the enrollment of the first subject in MAPS\u00d5MDMA/PTSD study. I also laid the ground-work for MAPS\u00d5 first Israeli medical marijuana projects. Along with Philippe Lucas, founder ofthe Vancouver Island Compassion Society(VICS), who MAPS brought to Israel as anexpert consultant, I met with the IsraeliMinistry of Health (MOH) official consideringwhether to license a non-profit medicalmarijuana production facility. Joining us werean Israeli MD with expertise in herbal medi-cines (especially the pomegranate) and severalIsraeli medical marijuana advocates. Thefacility is providing marijuana for sale to alimited number of MOH-approved patients, tokeep them from having to obtain black marketsupplies. I assume my great-great grandmother would initially be perplexed and inclined todisapprove of my work. Yet, I think she wouldcome to understand and support our efforts toprovide medicines and healing to those inneed. What might give her pause is ourbroader struggle to help people experience theunderlying sense of connection and meaningprovided by the mystical experience, whichpsychedelics can catalyze. Since she had somesort of spiritual yearning, I hope that she\u00d5d seethis aspect of our work as an antidote tofundamentalism, fostering a more universalspirituality that nevertheless embraces theunique particularities of religions. The need for touchstones between reli- gions, and for MDMA/PTSD research, wasmade vivid as my family and I traveled throughareas of Israel that were evacuated last yearduring the war. One day, we walked through-out the Old City of Jerusalem, commenting onthe relaxed atmosphere. The very next morn-ing, a running gun battle broke out in theChristian Quarter, where we had been walkingso shortly before. A Palestinian jumped anIsraeli guard, took his gun, shot him in theshoulder, ran, and was killed by another Israeliguard who chased him. Ten bystanders werehurt, some from ricocheted bullets. It\u00d5s in large part to provide antidotes to and prevention of these worldly, destructivenon-psychedelic moments, that motivate menow to continue MAPS\u00d5 work, inspired andempowered by the sorts of experiences pre-sented in this special issue. m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 3 MAPS\u00d5 organizational strategy prioritizes clinical research because cold, hard science is required to lay the foundation for the broad changes that we are aiming to generate. Although clinical research may persuade the FDA that psychedelics and marijuana are safe and have legitimate therapeutic applica- tions, the re-integration of legal contexts for the use of psychedelics in oursociety can only reach its full potential if there is an honest, human side to the story as well. The human stories are already there, waiting to be told. Furthermore, for some people in certain contexts, psychedelics are already somewhat integrated into their culture or society. Yet, thanks to prohibition and the associated stigmas and misunderstandings surrounding psychedelics, many potentially valuable stories and lessons are never shared. One of the more insidious aspects of psychedelic prohibition is that it can trap its critics and civil disobedients in oppositional dualisms. As by- products of society and open to the subtle power of suggestion, even psychedelic users can\u00d5t help but take some of society's implicit assumptions for granted. That has been my experience, at least. Shortly after my eighteenth birthday, I had my first \u00d2experience,\u00d3 with a friend at a lush botanical park. In retrospect, I was not as well-educated or prepared as I could have been. For one thing, my primary motivation was \u00d2fun.\u00d3 While it was indeed fun at times, it was also one of the most startling, blissful, self-introspective,frightening, emotionally unsettling, surreal and thought-provoking experiences of my life. My expectation of mere \u00d2fun,\u00d3 as one might imagine, was somewhat counter-productive. Another effect of prohibition is that it influences more than just laws; it also institutionalizes other forms of discrimination. Growing up in the 1980s and 90s in a mostly poor, multi-racial neighborhood in Miami, I not only saw the catastrophic effects of the \u00d2War on Drugs\u00d3 firsthand, but I alsogleaned from the city\u00d5s racial and ethnic tensions that changing a law or policy\u2014such as prohibiting race-based prejudice and segregation\u2014does not necessarily change ingrained behaviors and assumptions. If psychedelics were made completely legal tomorrow, more subtle forms of harmful discrimina- tion would undoubtedly persist. For MAPS to achieve its long-term goals ofre-integrating the legal use of psychedelics and marijuana into our society, it is imperative that we facilitate cultural understanding, in addition to scien- tific knowledge. While it may be practical for MAPS to identify specific clinical indications for which psychedelic-assisted therapy is safe and efficacious, MAPS also believes that with proper preparation and guidance, psychedelics can help improve the quality of life for \u00d2normal,\u00d3 healthy people without a diagnosedpsychiatric disorder. The topic of self-discovery cuts to the heart of this. On behalf of the MAPS staff, thank you to the thoughtful, open, and courageous individuals that contributed to this special issue. \u00a5Letter from the Editor Jag Davies4 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 Psychedelics and Consciousness The \u00d2one reality/one truth\u00d3 perspective was totally destroyed for me by my first psychedelic trip. I had the benefit of two experiencedguides, and some really good LSD, Tim Scully\u00d5s \u00d2Orange Sunshine.\u00d3 I took the tabs at 10 in the morning, and by noon my mind had been substantially remade. It is not what happened during the trip (anotherstory altogether) but how I understood it that was so shaking. From what I gathered, I had been asleep for 47 years believing that the way I saw things was pretty much the way they actually were.People who disagreed with me were either poor observers, or bad atdrawing conclusions. How could so many people be mistaken about somany things? I didn\u00d5t have an answer to that, but I knew that I waspretty much right. The trip led me to a small understanding of how the mindgenerates its own reality andhow each of those realities was aproduct of the mind\u00d5s endlesscultural programming. Under this new perspective, I came to understand thateverything I saw and didn\u00d5t see,heard and didn\u00d5t hear-all of theinputs by which I judged reality-were in fact a product ofinnumerable filters and screensof whose ability to shape myworld I had been almost totallyunaware. I was familiar withthat idea but had never aparticular fluid, richer inpossibilities, more ambiguous,more paradoxical, more multi-dimensional and more fun. This open framework offered a better way of thinking for me. Daily life was still chop wood/carry water, butnow with a more discriminating ax and a less leaky bucket. As LSD brought about a great cognitive shift for me, so Ecstasy opened my heart in ways that have helped me live in a less dichotomous world,more deeply connected to all beings. If you\u00d5re lucky, these openings do not totally contract in the course of everyday life. If you have a pipe, and some smoke-able herbs, you can atleast remind yourself of the reality of those deeper places, even when youdon\u00d5t get the full energy of being there. That, in brief, is my experience, but not one that I would see as being universal. As always, caveat emptor . \u00a5 Daily life was still chop wood/carry water, but now with a more discriminating ax and a less leaky bucket.Jeremy Tarcher6 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 incredibly gifted guide, I would not have been successful at all of my responsibili-ties. My psychedelic therapy allowed meto work through an attachment to suffer-ing, which came partly from my tradi-tional Jewish upbringing. It made meaware of many personality issues thatwere crippling me, and it taught me howto be a father to my children. I rememberone experience I had in which I felt, inaltered consciousness, what it is like to bea child treated harshly by his father. I [Psychedelic therapy] made me aware of many personality issues that were crippling me, and it taught me how to be a father to my children.For five years I took an intentional vacation from altering my consciousnessin any way. Then, at age 55 I went on asolo pilgrimage to Manaus, Brazil, where Idrank ayahuasca for the first time in atherapeutic context. This experience, likemy first LSD trip, was life-transforming. Ihad finally found my medicine, or ratherthe medicine had found me. During thelast seven years, with the help of thisamazing mixture of plants, I have madetremendous progress with issues ofcontrol, obsessive thinking, fear andfinding meaningful work. With the helpof insights obtained with the use ofayahausca, I summoned the courage toleave a corporate job to pursue teaching,and I have broken the back of a lifelongfood addiction. My spiritual life is incred-ibly rich, my marriage is alive and vibrantand I am comfortable in my role as afather. I returned to Brazil several more times, once with my wife and anothertime with my daughter. All of my earlierexperiences with psychedelics lead me towhat in South America is called \u00d2themedicine\u00d3 or la purga (\u00d2the purge\u00d3). I livewith less anxiety and worry, and I havedays where I marvel at the beauty andcreativity that surrounds me. I truly cannot imagine who I would be without the knowledge and wisdom Ihave received through the use ofpsychedelics. They have taught me how toovercome seemingly insurmountableobstacles. They introduced me to spiritual-ity, and have allowed me to gain insightsabout life, death and immortality. Theyhave taught me how to live. I am forevergrateful to the guide who helped extricateme from suffering, and to all those whohave gone before and paved the way forthose of us on the medicine path. \u00a5vowed then and there to make every effort not to put out such harsh energy to myown children, and, if I accidentally did, Iwould immediately apologize. This is justone of many experiences of teaching thatwere so important to me during this time. Psychedelics started me on a spiritual path that has become the foundation ofmy life. I began a lifelong meditationpractice and became intensely interestedin Buddhism, which provided a map of theterritory I was exploring in my sessions. Iam almost certain that my 30-yearmarriage would not have survived with-out this spiritual path. I cannot imagineliving without the lessons and tools I havegained in expanded consciousness. At the end of my twelve years of guided healing with the aid of substances,I was encouraged to do a high dosemushroom session by myself, with myguide nearby. During this blissful andterrifying session I learned that I had thetools to journey on my own into theserealms. The experience was tremendouslyempowering. I had graduated to a newlevel of exploration. m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 7 Growing up gay in the sixties was anything but that. The subject was hardly talked about in polite society. When it was mentioned at all, itwas in embarrassed, hushed tones and the subject was quickly changed. Icould hardly admit this secret truth about myself. All I knew was a lot offrustration and loneliness. I wanted to change my life, to make it freer andhappier but I didn\u00d5t know how. Church didn\u00d5t help too much. A couple ofpsychotherapists had barely scratched the surface. I had heard of LSD ofall places in Sunday schoolfrom a young seminarystudent and wondered howa pill could enable one to seeGod. Then one day myfather brought a book homefor me titled The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience. It was basically case studies ofpeople whose lives had beenchanged through insightsreceived during guidedsessions with entheogens. Iate it up and determinedthat whatever else I didwhile at college, I was goingto look into that. The substances I was interested in, namely LSDand mescaline, were alreadyillegal by that time, and Iknew of no one who wasprofessionally trained tofacilitate therapeuticsessions with them. So, I was on my own both to obtain the substancesand to conduct my own sessions. I knew the importance of proper mentalpreparation and a supportive setting and did the best I could with mylimited resources as a college student living on campus. I had expected tosee hallucinations and was totally unprepared for something so deep, rich,and profound, that seemed more real to me than anything I had called\u00d2reality\u00d3 up to that time. Though I didn\u00d5t have language to express it then,what I was in fact seeing was the divine nature of my own soul. As long asI live I will never forget the \u00d2talk\u00d3 the universe had with me during anexperience in a public park with peyote. It was all about self-acceptanceand going with the flow of things. Such deep cosmic truth had neverbefore been encoded on a discarded gum wrapper. Wow! As a ministerial intern and lifelong student of consciousness, I must in all fairness say that I do not believe that any mystical or religiousexperience\u2014however it is arrived at\u2014is transformational all by itself.There is no magic bullet and no substitute for the discipline of spiritualpractice and the work that entails. But such experiences do facilitate adepth of personal conviction and understanding that can inform ourchoices made in the everyday world, if we allow it to be so. Such choicesmade in integrity with the deepest parts of our revealed being can lead usto the truest and fullest experience of life that we are capable of. Andwhat purpose is nobler than that? \u00a5 There is no magic bullet and no substitute for the discipline of spiritual practice and the work that entails.Entheogens and Personal Development Terry Turner 8 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 Doctor Quantum Drops AcidNick Herbert, PhD Photo: Reno DeCaro m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 9 By 1963 I had completed my course work, passed my prelims, chosen a thesis advisor, andstarted my thesis work on a small particleaccelerator located in the basement ofStanford\u00d5s Inner Quad. Meanwhile, in acampus folk dance class, I met Ann Manly, apretty psychology undergraduate who intro-duced me to her friend Rae Larson, a psychol-ogy graduate student. Like all undergraduatewomen, Ann lived in a dorm, but Rae wasrenting a cozy little house in East Palo Altowhere Ann spent most of her free time. Inaddition to being a friend to both women,I served as a psychological guinea pig for theirclasses in \u00d2Psychological Testing\u00d3 and wassubjected to interminable rounds of IQ,personality and mental pathology tests. Ilearned almost nothing from these tests exceptthat I was quite clever (which I already knew)and that I had a pathetically low ability tomemorize strings of numbers. Their feminine charms and curious psych tests attracted me, but, in addition, Ann andRae had enrolled as subjects in an off-campusprogram which was investigating the effects ofa new mind drug called LSD. The Institute forAdvanced Study (IFAS) in Menlo Park wasfounded by Myron Stolaroff, an Ampexengineer, and was staffed by a number ofStanford faculty and graduate\u00d4 students, someof whom I knew as friends, notably JimFadiman and Willis Harman. I had heard of LSD. During my first year in California, I had picked up a book by AlanWatts (whom I had never heard of) describingIn the fall of 1957, while studying engineering physics at Ohio State, I was working as an intern in America\u00d5s nascent space program at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik and opened up the \u00d2missile gap.\u00d3 To catch up with the Russians, the US quickly began shoveling lots of money into American science. So when I graduated (at the top of my class) from OSU in 1959, I was awarded a \u00d2Sputnik scholarship\u00d3 to any graduate school I pleased. Thus, courtesy of the Soviet missile program, I ended up at Stanford. his two LSD sessions in a rural setting. In The Joyous Cosmology , Watts describes religious and philosophical insights perceived under itsinfluence as well as enhanced perception ofnatural objects. This book, to my mind, is stillone of the best introductions to the effects ofLSD, from a religious philosophy perspective.It aroused my curiosity about this new mind-altering drug. I wished I could try some myself. The LSD program at IFAS in Menlo Park cost $600, priced out of reach for a poorgraduate student, but I hoped I could at leastexperience LSD vicariously through theadventures of my friends Ann and Rae. ne theoretical model for the IFAS project was that they would set up a situation that precisely inverts the classicFreudian \u00d2primal scene.\u00d3 In Freud\u00d5s model ofneurosis the child experiences a profoundlydistressing emotional event (his parentscopulating, say) that his immature mindcannot integrate into his map of the world.The memory of this psychologically indigest-ible primal scene is repressed, say the Freud-ians, surfacing only as inexplicable neuroticsymptoms. If an unutterably horrible experi-ence on an unprepared mind can make yourlife worse, how might an indescribablybeautiful experience by a specially preparedmind change a person\u00d5s life for the better? Thiswas one of the questions that the people at theFoundation in Menlo Park intended to address. The primary goal of the Foundation was to help you design your first psychedelic experi-As a physicist I question the powers-that-be: \u00d2If you trust me with Plutonium, why not LSD?\u00d3 OOOOO10 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 ence for maximum positive impact. You chose the friends you wanted to be with, the setting, the music and thequestions you wanted to ask. The therapist who would beyour guide got to know you through the (inevitable)psychological tests and interviews. To investigate yourpossible reaction to the \u00d2ego loss\u00d3 sometimes experiencedunder LSD, a supervised session under \u00d2carbogen\u00d3 wasscheduled. This gas is a mixture of oxygen and carbondioxide which triggers a physiological \u00d2drowning reflex.\u00d3Some participants in the IFAS program reported that thepanic induced by carbogen was worse than anything theyexperienced under acid.hallucination,\u00d3 I scoffed, arrogantly challenging the drug to show me more. I got to my feet, rushed to the bathroom to throw up. I returned, sipped some more tea. The hallucinations hadvanished. Perhaps because of my initial bad manners,minimal visual effects occurred that afternoon and visualeffects tended to be rare in my subsequent experienceswith psychedelics. Then I was swept up in a wave of amplified attention to my inner life. My mind was racing, full of thoughts,images, and relationships. And I could attend to thesethoughts with a powerful intensity not available in my Before I tried acid I was entirely ignorant of the range of states of mind it is possible for humans to experience. As Ann & Rae were wending their way through the IFAS program, anticipating their first acid trip, we werereading everything we could get our hands on about thisnew mind-altering drug. Coincidental with the investiga-tions going on at Stanford, a program at Harvard led byDrs. Leary, Alpert and Metzner was gathering steam.They began publishing their own results as well as classicaccounts of what they called \u00d2expanded awareness\u00d3 in anew journal called the Psychedelic Review. 1 Either in Psychedelic Review or in one of the many papers referenced there, we discovered that there wereseveral naturally occurring sources of LSD and LSDanalogs such as LSA. One of these sources was the com-mon morning glory seed, a variety of which was used inceremonies by natives of Mexico. The effective dosage ofLSA lies between 100-500 micrograms and the literatureimplied that one seed was equivalent to one microgramof LSD. In the fall of 1963 I visited a nursery in San Jose and purchased a 10-pound sack of morning glory seeds, anddecided to run my own psychedelic session with Ann andRae as guides. the afternoon of October 5, 1963, in Rae\u00d5s comfortable little house in Palo Alto, I ingested 300 seeds ground up and mixed with peanut butter toimprove the taste and settled in to wait for the visions.The taste of morning glory seeds is really horrible. Recall-ing that taste still makes me shudder. Much worse thanpeyote or ayahuasca. About half an hour later, to calm my stomach I was sipping a cup of tea and became fascinated by the way thetea was flowing back down the rim of the cup. Suddenlythe liquid wetting the inside of the cup was transformedinto a cascade of glistening jewels. \u00d2Beautiful, but a mereordinary state. I saw myself with a clarity never before achieved, immersed myself in my \u00d2Nickness\u00d3 in a way Ihad never thought possible. When LSD was first tested by psychologists some believed it caused an artificial psychoses (a \u00d2psychotomi-metic\u00d3) and thus useful as a tool for therapists to get afirst-hand experience of what it was like to go crazy. Butthe term coined by Canadian psychologist HumphreyOsmond (also famous for giving acid to Aldous Huxley)more precisely LSD\u00d5s effects. \u00d2Psychedelic\u00d3means \u00d2mind searchlight intothe depths of your own subjectivity, an intense probe intowhat it means to be \u00d2you.\u00d3 eanwhile, back in Rae Larson\u00d5s living room I was busy exploring the insides of Nick Herbert with a clarity, an urgency and an intensity that were neverpreviously available. As a good physicist I had planned todo a little science. I was going to examine the timedistortion alleged to occur under acid. To this end I waswearing a watch with a sweep-second hand and myexperiment consisted of simply observing whether thehand was traveling faster or slower than normal. The results surprised me. Immersed in the rich details of my own inner state, it was difficult to draw my atten-tion to the watch on my wrist. It seemed one of thousandsof options to explore and I would get to it soon. In fact Iwould get to it NOW! And then I looked at my watch. The watch was running at normal speed. But I was completely straight. I closed my eyes and re-entered thepsychedelic state. But every time I tried to look at mywatch it brought me down. It was impossible for me to betripping and to do science. I did this three times and gaveup. The universe (or a deeper part of Nick) was showingoff its peculiar sense of humor. MMMMM OnOnOnOnOn m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 11 Then it came and tried to get me. I felt myself dissolv- ing around the edges, vaguely uneasy. This was no longerfun. Whatever it was that made me ME was somehowfragmenting away. The foundations of who I was werecrumbling. I didn\u00d5t like this one bit. I asserted myself. And it brushed me aside. I pulled myself together. And it scattered me into pieces. Then I realized (again with a bit of humor) that I was fighting with something that knew all my tricks. All mydefenses were useless because the enemy (enemy?) wasalready inside the walls, could read all my codes, knew allof my weaknesses, and could see through my pretensions. I laughed. And dissolved into nothingness. No Nick. I emerged again. Only to be swept under once more. The best way I can describe this state is that there is no Nick. But there is still a very intense awareness, aperception. But it\u00d5s entirely impersonal. What\u00d5s left ofNick is a terror that the LSD has wrecked his mind andthat he\u00d5s going to exist in this state forever. If this state isthe ego loss that the Buddhists so earnestly seek, it\u00d5sabsolutely worthless. There\u00d5s no one to enjoy it. I have experienced this state more than once onit is folly to lock up scientists for their choice of tools. Any nation that imprisons its scientists for investigatingpsychedelic drugs belongs in the Middle Ages. As aphysicist I question the powers-that-be: \u00d2If you trust mewith Plutonium, why not LSD?\u00d3 a scientific research tool , LSD is particularly interesting because it alters not merely perceptions but the very entity doing the perceiving.

Sometimes it\u00d5s morelike having the movies watch you. Looking in a mirror onacid is particularly informative. In addition to my many teachers, friends and guides, three of the most important influences on my life havebeen Catholicism, quantum physics and LSD. The firstgave me an appreciation for the spiritual side of life, thesecond an appreciation for the mysterious complexity ofthe material world and the third an appreciation of theunexplored depths of subjective experience.

And the answer may be: from a of personal inquisitiveness. Aren\u00d5t therevisionary states involved? Don\u00d5t does anybody thinkthis stuff up? In short: Yes and no. Mostlyjust breathing and being. Psychedelics have helped to open me up to the possibilities contained withinmy own psyche, have helped me to gainsome understanding of the presence that isoutside of myself, and have given morethan just a little push toward understand-ing that those two things are one in thesame. Of course, yoga has helped this too.As has meditation, walks along the beach,dancing, painting, in short: LivingConsicously. My work is born from apractice of continual self-discovery andbeing open to the messages that are beingspoken by the universe. Psychedelics are helpful in uncovering the layers of the self. In my early twentiesthey helped to blast open the doors. But, sodid the music, the dancing and the intensemotivations. What I mean to say is whathas already been said before: set andsetting are as important to the process asthe drug itself. Your very own mind helpsto provide that set and setting. This iswhere intentions find importance. A solidspiritual practice based on compassion andwisdom (not dogma) is more than justuseful, it is intrinsic to the process. Oncethat self, that identity, has been uncov-ered, the actual work of deconditioningand deconstructing can begin. Until wehave pulled the wool away from our eyesand truly looked at our minds and heartsas they are and not as we would like themto be can we really begin to make anyprogress on this path of self discovery.

Atthat time it was located in the five storyatrium opposite Barnett Newmans\u00d5\u00d2Broken Obelisk.\u00d3 I went to the third,fourth and fifth floors so I could get abetter view of the painting, only to haveto head back down to standing 12 inchesin front of it again just to examine thetexture and details. It opened up beforeme, blasting open my mind. I saw the truedepth of this masterpiece, the vastlifetimes contained with in it, the mul-tiple moments of NOW. The sadness andawe, romance, war, faces, memories,French powder rooms and uptightsummer garden parties, every face ofevery person I have ever known. It was ajaw-droppingly inspiring experiencebecause this artist, in a painting with asubject matter so simple, managed tocapture the infinite. But it opened my mind a bit TOO much. I was cracked open, and, by doingso, the demons that had been hiding,lurking in dungeons, locked away for toolong, were set loose in the corridors of mymind. I spent the next six hours in ourhotel room, dying, being reborn, passingout to fall slam! to the floor, livingthrough multiple realities, coming back,Art, Being, and Self-Discovery Michael Brown S m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 13 still in the hotel room, going nuts with the demons of my mind. I always droppedback inside, back to breathing, back tofocusing on the path. Afterwards, while room service didn\u00d5t have too difficult of a time cleaning up theroom, it took me a while to pick up thepieces of my mind. While some might findsuch an experience frightening enough tonever touch psychedelics again, this iswhere I find psychedelics to be the mostuse and where they inform my creativeprocess the most. There are many peoplewho decide that, since some demon rearedits head, or they saw some ugly part ofthemselves they would rather forgetabout, then the \u00d4fun\u00d5 isn\u00d5t there, and,therefore, the drug is not a good thing totake. Or, they say, \u00d2I had a bad trip once\u00c9\u00d3or \u00d2It was too much once.\u00d3 I bet it was. Ittakes some time to really lift the veil, and,if we don\u00d5t go in with the right intentions,it is liable to happen against our will. Afterall, it is our will holding down the veil tobegin with. Many times, people dive intopsychedelics because they promisediversion. e could go all over the place out there in the world, and completely deny that any of it has to do with us. Butwhen it comes to our own minds, there isno denying what lies there. That inabilityto disassociate from the actual stuffmaking up our identities is where it getsscary for some people. In reality, this iswhen the medicine is finally working. Psychedelics are a tool to help unlock doorways that seem otherwise obscured oreven hidden. Once opened it takes astrong will to work with what is uncov-ered. When we come back here, to thisnow, we cannot always assume that thework we did while high is complete. Wewill uncover a demon perhaps that haslurked there since before we were evenborn. Or we may uncover vast untoldtreasures of bliss. One way or another,it is up to us to integrate these newfoundconcepts into our lives.Here is where my work as an artist is most relevant to my spiritual path. Thecreative process helps me to explore myself, my visions, my personal experiencesand my relationship to the divine. I don\u00d5tmake artwork as a recreation of somehallucination. And I don\u00d5t takepsychedelics merely to have a vision whilein an altered state. Rather, psychedelics aretools to help with the uncovering of thelayers of the self and their relationships tothe rest of the world. Art is a way to bothcontinue exploring those layers andrelationships and to seek out new ones. Still, though, there is a third compo- nent that, without it, the other two of artand psychedelics are like a map and acompass without any North or South polesto align themselves to. That third tool ismeditation. In meditation, we set inten-tions, we dig up our dirt, we explorerelationships of thoughts and emotionsand reactions, we pay attention to our-selves and our relationship to the world atlarge. Painting and psychedelics are a partof the same path for me, but both areuseless as forms of self-discovery withoutthe simple practice of meditation. Medita-tion is how we learn to relate to ourselvesat a very simple level. If we just take our body, plop it down on a pillow, sit for a while, all sorts ofthings come up in our minds. Now, if wewere to do that for two, three, four days \u00d1suddenly we have some food for thought.Suddenly, it won\u00d5t quiet down. And whocan keep a straight face then? So we learn how to breathe. How to sit. How to walk or stand still. Throughyoga we learn how to hold ourselves, howto sit, how to stand. Through meditationwe learn how to navigate our minds.Then, once in a while, it\u00d5s good to rockthe boat a little, see what is hiding inthere, and remind ourselves why we dowhat we do. This process of learning how to be a human being: that is the process of self-discovery. \u00a5 Once opened it takes a strong will to work with what is uncovered. w14 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 Almost three years ago I had the opportunity to live with a spiritual teacher who was gifted in working with the sacred medicines-everything from LSD tomushrooms to MDMA to ayahuasca. At a particularpoint in my spiritual work with her, she suggested that itwas time for me to experience MDMA as a way ofopening myself ever more deeply to my own heart. In my life to that point I had had little experience withanything other than marijuana,aside from one divine experiencewith mushrooms. I was nervous,yet could feel at 47 years of age after decades of dedication to my own awakening process, theappropriateness of the timingand my own readiness. When the day came, we sat together within the sacred spaceshe had set for my experience. Itook the little white pill and satback to see what would happen.I was nervous, nervous, nervous. My teacher could tell when the medicine was just beginning to come on and suggested I lay back, cover my eyes with a blindfold and try to relax into what was about to happen. As I lay back and just tried to breathe, Isuddenly felt the medicine kick in. I experienced myselfimmediately moving fluidly out of my body and into astate of pure love, bliss, and joy like I had never beforeexperienced. It was not that I was feeling emotionalstates; this state of being was pure love, bliss, and joy.All of my doubts and questions about my worthinessdisintegrated in an instant that lasted for hours. I simplymelted into this \"Is-ness\" that was me, everything, andnothing all at the same time. For the first time, Onenessbecame more than just a concept and a dream and a vague knowing. I was it; and yet there was no \"I.\" Self- perception, yes, but in the context of \"The All Which Is.\" Needless to say, I was profoundly changed by this experience. I went on to have many other experienceswith my teacher and many other medicines as I steadily,Gratitude Trinity Heartsong profoundly, and intensely awoke to more levels. It soonbecame clear that I was diving into the most profoundpart of my own ongoing journey toward Wholeness. Inever saw this coming. Never. And yet, when I went intoeach and every experience with medicine, it always hada bit of a familiar flavor to it for me. It was as if I hadbeen doing this my whole life and had simply forgotten who and what I was. It was likewaking from a deep, long sleepthrough which I had beendreaming a dream of such hardship, pain, and suffering. These experiences have changed how I experienceeverything: myself, \"others,\" whatwe call \"reality,\" and what ispossible for us to awaken to,experience and know. My path ofservice has radically changed overthese years. I now commit myselfand my \"life\" to my own contin-ued and limitless awakening, and, through the embodiment of these experiences, to supporting those who find their way to me in midst oftheir own unique and beautiful process. I will always hold such deep gratitude for my teacher, who had the wisdom to know when the timewas right. Also, for the medicines, who are so dedicatedto helping human beings re-connect to their humanbeingness again. Finally, to myself, who found thecourage to say \"yes\" and the will to stay the path nomatter how frightening, arduous, or challenging I mayhave made it for myself. Thank you for the opportunity to write just a small bit of what has transpired for me over these years. I have not written any of this down as of yet. This feels like awonderful place to have started. Thank you also for the immensely important work you do to bring the awareness, acceptance, and trueknowledge of these medicines and all that they arecapable of offering, to the world at large. It is valuablebeyond measure. It was like waking from a deep, long sleep through which I had been dreaming a dream of such hardship, pain, and suffering. m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 15 I took out my few remaining psilocy- bin-containing mushrooms and ponderedthem. Though it may seem counter-intuitive, I soon came to understand thatthe clearest way to ask that question andreceive an answer was to ingest them. Ihave always found it beneficial to go intoany psychedelic experience with a focusedquestion on the mind. While I neverreceive an answer in clear plain English,in the days following the experience Icome to understand how the experienceheld relevance to the question in mymind. Sometimes I forget the questiononce the trip takes hold, but then the nextmorning I realize that the hours spentcontemplating a penny did indeed showme how to understand and come to termswith the dualities of our human existence,for example. For all that I had asked these sub- stances in the past\u2014and I am indeed awell-traveled psychonaut\u2014it had neveroccurred to me before to ask them ofthemselves. But now, in my darkestmoment, it was all that I could think toask. I set a kettle to boil and arranged myapartment for the trip with low lights andWhy Do I Take Psychedelics? calming music. I sat and cleared my mind of all but the question at hand. The kettlewhistled and I brewed the mushroomsinto a tea, sipping it slowly. The question slipped slowly out of my mind as the sensory aspects of the experi-ence became gradually overwhelming. Islowed my breath to calm my quickeningheartbeat and tried not to let myselfbecome too distracted by the visual flurriesthat began to permeate the physical worldaround me. I grew heavier, and, com-pletely overwhelmed, sank to the floor. II have always found it beneficial to go into any psychedelic experience with a focused question on the mind.Daniel ElderA few months ago , I had a moment of terrifying doubt that was in turn part of a turbulent sequence in my life. Every moment found me asking myself that most eternal question, \u00d2Who am I?\u00d3 For so long, I had used psychedelics as a guiding tool, a way of de- fragmenting my overloaded mental hard drive in order to gain a clarity of perspective on myself in the larger scheme of things. But now, disconnected from my love who was halfway across the world on her own adventure, and from my father who had sup- ported me for so long, in a moment when guidance was my great- est need, I began to doubt whether anything could help me, even psychedelics. I thought of them often, and I began to ask myself, \u00d2Why do I take psychedelics at all?\u00d316 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 lay there, staring at the ceiling for an eternity, feeling a gentle yet pressingurgency grow. I knew I had to close myeyes, and did. I had asked the mushrooms why I ever took them. In the confusion sur-rounding that question, I hadn\u00d5t stoppedto consider that it was the mushroomswho would take me. With eyes closed, I set out upon a journey. From a first-person perspective, Izoomed throughout my own body. Therewere the insides of my hands, there wasmy thumping heart. There, my stomach,churning. There, my lungs, rhythmic. Andthere, the base of my spine, like the foot ofsome great Incan temple. I began to ascend. I climbed the steps of my spine, and on either side I saw my life. The faces ofmy family encouraged me, as did friendsboth current and long lost. Work, love,longing, despair, every emotion I experi-enced and every facet of my life expresseditself in the manifestation of shapes andcolors. The staircase shook as I climbedhigher and higher, and bursting fireworksof color exploded up beyond the peak likesome chemical volcano. At the center ofthese explosions, some glowing thing wasspinning gyroscopically. The object grewuntil finally I was before it and it was as ifI had fallen to my knees on themountaintop. There at last. Upon lifting my eyes I saw that the glowing object was a molecule. It did notmatter which one it was. It was not anymolecule; it was every molecule. I watchedit for what felt like a lifetime, rotating andglowing, and felt as if I was looking uponthe face of the godhead. I rose, and turnedto let my eyes follow the tendrils I sawrunning away from it. They ran like a weband bonded to all the things I had passedon my journey to this altar inside mymind. Ropes of energy connected all theaspects of my life, each to the molecule,and each to one another, and I saw thatone of them ran directly to me as well. I had been so alone, so lost, when I embarked on the journey. And yet herewas the answer to my lonely question.The experience reminded me that all things are connected, and that sometimesloneliness and despair can be a sort ofhubris. To think one is alone, at any point,is an affront to the interconnected natureof all things. It was humbling and gratify-ing to see and understand that the smallestof things, this psilocybin molecule ingestedinto my body, could reveal to me theconnections that were always there butthat I had somehow forgotten. When I finally opened my eyes, I could not for the life of me remember whatloneliness felt like. The world around me,which I had felt so withdrawn from,seemed now to be connected to every fiberof my being. My sleep that night wasamong the most peaceful that I have everknown. Yet, it has taken time for me to learn the true lesson imparted to me by thisexperience. It has been eight months sincethat night. In that time, I have become avoracious reader of drug- and drug policy-related literature. I am coming to under-stand that, as Terence McKenna once said, \u00d2The mind rests upon a foundation of chemical machinery. This is not to say thatthe mind is chemical machinery.\u00d3 I find myself feeling more strongly now about the need for drug law andpolicy reform than I have ever felt a drivefor before. It has become my life\u00d5s passionto work toward educating society at largeabout the safe and responsible manner inwhich psychedelics can be ingested to gaininsight into ourselves and our relationshipwith the world around us, and about thedifference between drug use and drugabuse. My experiences have taught me thatpsychedelics can be important tools, andthat\u2014like any tools\u2014your intentions affectthe outcome of your using them. I can onlyhope and strive toward my goal: that in mylifetime, I will see the stigma against thesesubstances torn down so that people maygain both medicinal and spiritual benefitsfrom these powerful molecules that havebeen unfairly demonized for so long. Why do I take psychedelics? It turned out that the answer is in the question, andI will never cease to ask it. \u00a5 My experiences have taught me that psychedelics can be important tools, and that- like any tools- your intentions affect the outcome of your using them.18 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 The Influence of Psychedelics on my Personal Development Psychedelics reveal to me, like applying heat to invisible ink, the strands that connect all the matter and ideas in the universe.2) Everything is connected. Psychedelics reveal to me, like applyingheat to invisible ink, the strands thatconnect all the matter and ideas in theuniverse. The patterns of connection arebeautiful and fascinating. I believe there isvaluable carryover in terms of lateralthinking ability in my normal life. 3) Music is fantastic. Related to both pleasure and connectedness, psychedelicshighlight patterns in music, impart to menew appreciation of and openness to avariety of musical types, which has mademe a better musician. 4) Nothing matters. The whole ball of wax - the societal facades that try to keepus behaved, the structures our own egoshave made to make ourselves important -none of it matters, none of it meansanything, there is no god, everything isridiculous. 5) Opposites are often both true. Yes, everything is connected, but we are alsoall alone, just a solitary consciousness herein the command center trying to makesense of chunks of sensory input that havebeen hurled over the wall. Yes, nothingAaron Long Like many people, I first took psychedelics in college when my life wasalready very much in flux and exposed tomyriad influences. I began (and finished)college as a writing major, so it wasn\u00d5t as ifI was majoring in warmongering, tookLSD, saw the light, and switched to thehumanities. And this is the thing: I havenever had one of those watershed mo-ments where a major life shift was spurredby psychedelics. Yet I would put thepsychedelic experience right near the topof the list of the most important thingsever to happen to me. I pondered on thisand decided that it would be instructive tofocus on the commonalities of my psyche-delic experiences: 1) Pleasure. I find psychedelics intensely pleasurable and fun. This aspectof psychedelics often seems to be theelephant in the corner in this publication,understandable given that MAPS wants tobe taken seriously in its quest for thelegalization of psychedelics for medicaluse, though perhaps this circumspection istaken too far. I posit that fun is an under-rated medicant.While at first blush it seems obvious to me that psychedelics have been important to my personal development, the firmbeliever in the scientific method that I am hesitates. Can Ireally ascribe changes to certain aspects of my personality tothe influence of psychedelics? Experiences, aging, family, friends, lovers, books, music, and pure chance also all seem like strong causal candidates. Had I never had a psychedelicexperience would I be very different? Would I be more conser-vative, more narrow-minded? Would I be less kind? Would Ihave a different job? Would I be married and have children?Would I find long, meandering guitar solos disagreeable? m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 19 I find psychedelics intensely pleasurable and fun. This aspect of psychedelics often seems to be the elephant in the corner in this publication...matters, but also every- thing matters becauseeverything is connectedand thus we are all a partof everything, so reallythere is just one thing-everything-ergo, you andeveryone and everythingelse are god. Those are the things I commonly experiencewhile tripping. What do Ibring back with me fromthe other side of the doorto everyday life? Whathave I brought back thathas influenced mypersonal development? I think I can sum it up like so: winning stopped mattering very much. Iwas born with a very competitive nature. Iplayed all sorts of sports and games, Iloved to argue, I loved to stand out in class.All of it mattered a lot: I hated to lose. Ibelieve psychedelics have softened myedge. Psychedelics revealed via the\u00d2nothing matters\u00d3 factor that things likewinning and losing, winner and loser, aremostly counter-productive societalconstructs (based on innate Darwinianinstincts) that lead us to compete selfishlyfor resources rather than to share them forthe common good. I still love sports andgames, but now the love is for the playing.I still like a good argument, but have cometo believe that the happiest interpersonalrelationships result from achievingconsensus rather than proving that youare righter than everyone else. I still like toperform well in my endeavors, but I cutmyself some slack. I must acknowledge that the argument could also be made thatpsychedelics have hurt my competitiveedge, which possibly has had negativerepercussions in matters of career andmating. Maybe so, but I think I am akinder, happier, better-balanced indi-vidual than I used to be, which I thinktallies as a win.\u00a520 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 AS I DROVE MY CAR from Connecticut to Cali- fornia, the radio played \"When you go to San Francisco,be sure to wear some flowers in your hair.\" It was fun toimagine that I was making this countercultural trek to theMecca of hippiedom, but flowers weren't for me. I was onmy way to start a doctoral program in Educational Admin-istration at Stanford and pick up an MBA on the side. Theneonate field of computer-assisted instruction caught mymind's eye, and I thought that after finishing these degreesI'd work for General Electric, Westinghouse, or anothercompany developing this new kind of teaching machine.Summer 1967Thomas B. Roberts, PhD If psychedelics allowed us to use our minds in a different way, were there other techniques too, other ways?From \"Flowers in your Hair\" to Ideas in my MindFrom \"Flowers in your Hair\" to Ideas in my Mind m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 21 In the course \u00d2Organizational Behavior\u00d3 in the School of Business, wehad a case study of Ashtok Rajguru, abright, hard-working Indian who cameto America but whose work deterio-rated. Using Maslow\u00d5s needs hierarchy,we interpreted his problems to the lackof the emotional support he had beenembedded in while living in India. Ihad another paper due in educationaladministration and found Maslow\u00d5sideas useful there too. Then anotherMaslow paper, and another. I decided towrite my dissertation showing how thisset of ideas could be used in education.Psychedelics were in the air around theBay Area, but still not for me. Someone told me that there was a professor, Willis Harman, in an oddly named department, Engineer-ing Economic Systems, who was studying Maslow\u00d5s needshierarchy, and he taught a Graduate Special course \u00d2TheHuman Potential.\u00d3 I put myself on the waiting list, andafter several quarters passed, I finally enrolled. Theseminar course considered meditation and yoga, parapsy-chology, and states of consciousness, among other things\u2014all very \u00d2fringy\u00d3 then. One week a graduate student couple described their first LSD experience the previous weekend. Clearly,words couldn\u00d5t do it justice, and much to my surprise theything. Intimations of what? As an intuitive thinker, I like to make senseof things, see their implications, andconnect the dots. Wonderful as thissight was, this was more than a feastfor eyeballs. But what was it, and whatwere its implications? Other sessions,other days, and in other places raisedmore questions. How could I remem-ber things so forgotten from my past?What did those feelings of portentous-ness and sacredness mean? Ifpsychedelics allowed us to use ourminds in a different way, were thereother techniques too, other ways?How does one even go about thinkingabout these things? What idea-quests lay hidden in these experiences? And the idea that hasmost occupied my life: how can these benefit humanity,particularly Western culture? June 1972. By one of those lucky, life-directing cosmic coinci- dences, I was in Bifrost, Iceland, attending a conferenceon psychobiology and transpersonal psychology. Theconference organizer was Icelandic, and it was a naturalmeeting ground for Europeans and North Americans. Ihad no idea who these people were. Joseph Campbellenthralled us with a slide lecture going up the Hinduchakras and down the Tibetan Buddhist chakras. Heexplained that this was not just a collection of religiousideas and iconography, but a map of the human mind,experiences that went far beyond our ordinary conscious-ness. Huston Smith talked about the mystical traditions ofworld religions and how LSD, peyote, and mescalinemight sometimes be used to experience mystical oneness.It wasn\u00d5t the experience itself that mattered most, he said,but what one understood and how one lived one\u00d5s lifeafterwards.Finally, here were sets of ideas I could use on my idea quest. to Events in my Career even seemed rational, not like the vampire-toothed, bug- eyed picture of slovenly drug fiends that the media andgovernments were pushing. Most of my classmatesnodded their heads understandingly and talked aboutmeaningfulness, sacredness, plastic perceptions, andmoments of insight. How could a group of highly selected,hard working, bright graduate students from departmentsacross Stanford have taken mind rotting drugs and still befunctional, even approving of others doing so? This didn\u00d5tfit in with what I had been taught about drugs. Later that quarter, one of my classmates had a ticket to hear Alan Watts (whoever that was) speak. He couldn\u00d5tuse the ticket and gave it to me, so I went. Here was anerudite, idea-stretching, articulate, charming priest-scholar comparing Eastern and Western religions andtelling how psychedelics gave depth to one\u00d5s understand-ing of spiritual development, including, of all things,mystical experiences. Another hearty swig of cognitivedissonance. February 1970. The rolling clouds in the sky and their reflections mirrored in Lake Tahoe fascinated me, not so much forwhat I was perceiving but because they intimated some-Stanislav Grof described his work originally in Czechoslovakia and Baltimore, and outlined his new mapof the human mind. From music therapy, through bodywork, and analytic therapy, therapists described theirwork with alcoholics, neurotics, and other categories ofpatients. Other speakers told how they used meditation,yoga, dreams, and other disciplines. Finally, here were sets of ideas I could use on my idea quest. There were many other ways to use our minds,and for me psychedelics opened a door to them. When Ireturned that summer to Northern Illinois University, Iadded a section on transpersonal psychology to mymaster\u00d5s-level educational psychology course, and a coupleyears later transpersonal educational psychology com-to Planting Cultural Seeds22 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 prised one quarter of my anthology Four Psychologies Applied to Education. Summer 1981. After following up on the Iceland-inspired readings, conscientiously reading the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology and Brain-Mind Bulletin, taking a sabbatical to visit the California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology,taking a course at the Institute for Asian Studies, doing amonth-long seminar with Stan Grof at Esalen and devour-ing his writings, especially Realms of the Human Uncon- scious, I decided to take the plunge. In the summer of 1981, I offered a specialtopics course, \u00d2Psychedelic Research.\u00d3 Northern Illinois University is not noted for being a hotbed of educationalinnovation, but after a bit of academicfolderol, they let me teach it. Soon afterI posted notices of the course onbulletin boards, my Assistant Depart-mental Chair received a call from theAssistant Provost inquiring whetherthis was an appropriate topic for auniversity course. Luckily, the paper-back edition of Grinspoon and Bakalar\u00d5sPsychedelic Drugs Reconsidered with its 40-page annotated bibliography hadjust been published. I photocopied thebibliography and sent it along with anote to the Assistant Provost sayingthat I didn\u00d5t see censorship as part of hisjob description and that I thought thecontent of courses was a departmental decision. If hewanted to discuss this, I offered, I thought we should do soat a full and open meeting of the University Council. Hereplied, via my assistant chair, that his inquiry was merelyin response to a question someone else had asked. \u00d2Psychedelic Research\u00d3 has gone through several name changes, always taught as a special topics course,until 2006 when it was approved as the first catalog-listedpsychedelics course in an American college or university. Ihad hoped that \u00d2Psychedelic Mindview\u00d3 (an interimname) would break the ice and encourage professorselsewhere to offer similar courses, but so far no luck. As\u00d2Foundations of Psychedelic Studies,\u00d3 I teach it in ourHonors Program once a year. Maybe now that it\u00d5s estab-lished as a regular course at NIU, this seed idea will bearfruit at other universities.Summer 1993. I wrote a draft of a paper on psychedelics and religion and sent it to Shasha Shulgin. He put Bob Jesse and me incontact, and in 1995 the Council on Spiritual Practicesand the Chicago Theological Seminary co-sponsored theconference \u00d2Psychoactive Sacraments.\u00d3 I hope religiousstudies programs will offer psychedelic courses too, andsociety may be undergoing a long transition into experi-ence-based religion rather than text-based religion. If so,churches and/or religious orders will do well and do good by figuring out how to incorporatepsychedelics. March 2006. Psychedelic-inspired questions morphed into broader mindbodyquestions, ones that look at manymindbody psychotechnologies besidespsychedelics. The how-humanity-can-benefit question grew with it andbecame a theme idea in my bookPsychedelic Horizons. Summer 2007. I don\u00d5t see psychedelics\u00d5 best location as part of an underground,subculture, or counterculture. How canthey enrich dominant cultures andimprove institutions? Besides educa-tion and religion, how might societybenefit from most effi-ciently and effectively? Other drugs(medicines) are expeditiously devel- oped by corporations, and we recognize this establishedpath of medical advance. Could psychedelics be adoptedinto mainstream culture this way too? I think so. In medicine and psychotherapy, responsible scientific work is starting again, and in the two volume anthologyPsychedelic Medicine, Michael Winkelman and I collected chapters ranging from cluster headaches and PTSD toaddictions, psychotherapy, and\u2014most intriguing of all\u2014cases of healing that seem impossible. March 2008. To encourage more movement along these and other psychedelic lines, next March I\u00d5ll be chairing a \u00d2RisingResearchers\u00d3 session World Psychedelic Forum 2008. I could write on about how psychedelics helped me appreciate additional arts and ideas, but for now it\u00d5senough to be grateful to psychedelics for giving me a lifethat integrates experience with ideas, personal meaning-fulness with professional direction. \u00a5I don't see psychedelics' best location as part of an underground, subculture, or counterculture. m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 23 An Interview with Ann Shulgin on Psychedelics and Self-Discovery Sarah: Can you discuss the influence of psychedelics on your own personalgrowth? Are there specific psychedelicsthat you consider particularly helpful toolsfor self-discovery? Ann: Every single human body has a different chemistry.So, just because aparticular drug orvisionary plant is myfavorite, or has taughtme a great deal, doesn\u00d5tmean it\u00d5s going to be sofor anyone else. In one recent case, I said often, too often,that something called2CB Fly was absolutelygreat for me. To me, it\u00d5sthe loveliest thing,especially for eroticism.But I found out that it\u00d5snot interesting toanybody else. I realizedthat having said that, Iwas putting things inmotion. The Internetwas full of 2CB Fly, andpeople were askingabout and I thought\u00d2uh-oh.\u00d3 It turned outthat it\u00d5s a disappoint-ment to most otherpeople. if I whatmy favorite psychedelicsare, it\u00d5s almost meaning-less for other people,because they have tofind their allies verycarefully. For example, 2CB, I think, is one of Sasha\u00d5s really great inventions, and I thinkthat 2CB is a pretty good friend to mostpeople. But you come to something likeayahuasca\u2014a close relative of mine feelsthat it\u00d5s the greatest teacher that she\u00d5s evercome across in the psychedelic world\u2014andI can\u00d5t take it. Sasha and I had two inter-esting experiences with ayahuasca. Wewent to a special place where the cer-emony was conducted by very dear friends of ours, and it was a lovely experience.Sasha has totally different kinds ofexperiences than I do, but both of us feltthat it was not going to be a dominantthing in our lives, although it was pleasant and we had enjoyed it.So we were quite readyto try it again sixmonths later. We wentto the same place withthe same people, andwe took a very smallamount. We werebeing very cautious,because we usually are.I spent the entire timeholding onto my seat,hoping that I wasgoing to survive,because I was beingrun over by a train.There was no way tolearn anything, excepthow to stay alive.Sasha had a totallydifferent experience,which was just asnegative in its ownway. He did a lot ofvomiting, while I didnone at all. Toward theend of my train ride, avoice in my head said,\u00d2Don\u00d5t come hereagain.\u00d3 I thought, \u00d2Uh-oh, well I\u00d5m not liable to,actually.\u00d3 But then the next day, when everyone was having thesecond session, we decided we wouldparticipate. But, we decided to take aminiscule amount, just a half or third ofwhat we took the day before, which was apretty minor amount in the first place.The train started coming at me again, andthe whole thing repeated for both of us,except it didn\u00d5t last quite as long. And thevoice came back, and it said, \u00d2Didn\u00d5t you Editor's Note: This past summer, the Sybil Society and MAPS co-sponsored the Women\u00d5s Visionary Congress, a uniquegathering of women working to implement realistic alternatives to drugprohibition and to re-define society\u00d5s understanding of psychedelics. Prior to theCongress, several interviews were conducted with elder stateswomen unable toattend in person. The interviews were recorded on video and shown at theconference. MAPS staffer and Bulletin co-editor Sarah Hufford took part in aninterview with Ann Shulgin, a portion of which is transcribed below. Formore information about the Women\u00d5s Visionary Congress, including audioand video of conference presentations, see visionarycongress.org. They teach you that you're much saner than you thought, and that you probably are much stronger, mentally, than you suspected...24 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 hear me the first time?\u00d3 At which point I said, \u00d2Okay, alright!\u00d3 I\u00d5ve never taken it again, and don\u00d5t intendto do so. Ayahuasca is one of the best alliesof a lot of people I know, but it\u00d5s not ours. Marijuana is the same thing. It would be great to be able to enjoy marijuana,because you could take it everyday, and weknow a lot of people who do. Also, I don\u00d5tlike alcohol at all, so there\u00d5s nothing I cantake every evening if I feel like it. Butmarijuana is also something that neither ofus can enjoy. Sasha feels that it\u00d5s a waste oftime because he doesn\u00d5t learn anything. Ifinally found out from my daughter, what Ihad not understood, which was that noteverybody has my marijuana experience.What happens to me is that I have a full-blown psychedelic experience, only withparanoia. And that\u00d5s not much fun. So allI\u00d5m learning is, number one, how to get outas soon as possible, and, number two, notto take it again. Yet, marijuana is thefavorite plant or drug of a tremendousnumber of people. So, it comes down to experimenting, carefully, on yourself. Please always have ababysitter, no matter how experienced youare-always. I won\u00d5t go into the things thatcan happen to hard-headed people withgreat experience who think that they cando it all by themselves and run intotrouble. Always have a babysitter who isfamiliar with the territory, and who cancome in and hold your hand, or say theright thing. I think that psychedelics aregreat spiritual tools, but like a lot of spiritual experiences, they can take you tovery, very dark places, and you can spendquite a lot of time wondering if you\u00d5regoing to get through some of theseexperiences. So, be careful and be veryrespectful of your mental, emotional, andphysical health. Take care of your body,and don\u00d5t take a powerful drug or plant ifyou\u00d5re not well. As for the effect of psychedelics on my life, I couldn\u00d5t begin to tell you, because Ihave no idea what my life would be likewithout them. Since I had major spiritualexperiences starting when I was an infant,I assume I would have found my way tosome sort of spiritual searching or explo-ration without their assistance. Psychedelics teach you about time. They teach you about the different levelsof reality that aren\u00d5t available to yourconscious mind most of the time. Theyteach you that you\u00d5re much saner thanyou thought, and that you probably aremuch stronger, mentally, than yoususpected, and that you are capable ofquite extraordinary things. I think thatpsychedelics are wonderful. But they arealso not for everyone. Not everyone findsthem an ally, and keeping that in mindthose people should study hypnotism andlearn the trance state, which opens thesame doors. No human being is limited toone means of self-discovery. Usepsychedelics only if you are quite sure thatthey are your path.\u00a5 Use psychedelics only if you are quite sure that they are your path. m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 25 E-ticket to Dharmaland long out-dated Sunday school myth, I finally opened up to my own numinousexperience. To paraphrase the great RudolfOtto, the \u00d2Numinous\u00d3 can be described as adistinctive experience of God, ineffableand transcendent, the primary source ofbeauty and love. Feelings of awe, fascina-tion and elements of overpowering-ness,urgency, and that which is \u00d2Wholly Other\u00d3are present in the psychedelic experience. Fate would have it that I quickly met more folks in the underground thatenjoyed entheogenic compounds. I beganexperimenting and researching. Soon I wasoff to my first psychedelic conference,ironically held on the conservativeChristian campus of Chapman University.It was there I met several mentors andfriends that would pop up again and againin my life, among them the late TerenceMcKenna, who dubbed me \u00d2TheShamanatrix.\u00d3 Before leaving, I picked up apublication called Psychedelic Illuminations. In it, I found an article written by RickDoblin, talking about his experience as asubject in a psychedelic study. In the sameissue, I found an ad seeking subjects for anupcoming MDMA study at UCLA, spon-sored by MAPS and headed by CharlesGrob, MD. Inspired by Doblin, I myselfbecame a subject in the study.Ingesting MDMA was a gift that put me on the neon yellow brick road to self-discovery and renewed my lost lease on spirituality.We struck up a conversation and somehow landed on the topic of MDMA.I expressed my interest and my fears. I\u00d5dheard about Ecstasy in college, but NancyReagan and McGruff the Crime Dog, aswell my staunch Republican, right-wing,evangelical Methodist local magistrate of afather all conditioned me to \u00d2Just Say NO!\u00d3I was 23 and I hadn\u00d5t ever even smokedweed. I barely dropped Tylenol when Ihad a headache! However, as he describedhis experiences with the substance, I wasintrigued. \u00d2And the best place to do it,\u00d3 he said, slyly smiling, \u00d2Disneyland.\u00d3 We exchanged numbers and contin- ued to converse and hang out over thenext couple of days and soon set a date togo to the happiest place on earth and gethappier. That day in Disneyland was a much- needed reminder that there was an unseenworld around me. I felt a oneness with notonly the crowds of people waiting in lineat Space Mountain but with the universe-at-large. Ingesting MDMA was a gift thatput me on the neon yellow brick road toself-discovery and renewed my lost leaseon spirituality. Rather than hoping to find through faith a belief in someone else\u00d5s story in aI was living\u2014if you can call it living\u2014in Los Angeles at the corner of atheism and agnosticism. It was the end of 1990. I had justmoved to the \u00d2left coast\u00d3 from a tiny hamlet in Lancaster County,Pennsylvania, a rural area filled with Amish people, horses and buggies, and lots of mullet hair and ill-cut acid wash jeans. As you could imagine, I had to get out. I found myself sitting at a coffeehouse I frequented on La Brea on open-mic night to kill sometime rather than myself. The guy I\u00d5d run away with to La-La-landhad just dumped me, but I was getting over both him and thedevastation. I couldn\u00d5t help but notice over the bad poetry, the intense eyes of a dark, curly-haired artsy dude who bore some- what of a resemblance to Tim Burton staring back at me. During the intermission, I slid onto the stool next to him at the bar. Sara Tonin26 m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 Soon I saw how the Buddhist and psychedelic paths share certain common-alities in the expansion of consciousnessin both theory and practice. Both philoso-phies can serve to make one a morecompassionate, sentient being. Practice inBuddhism\u00d5s mindfulness, like well-planned and intentioned sessions withpsychedelics, give people the power toovercome habitual behaviors and attach-ments. The heart-centered serenity feeling I first felt in the dark cave from MDMA(what is sometimes referred to as the\u00d2Buddha-drug\u00d3) loosens the bondage ofindividual ego and clears the pathway toan unusually high level of honesty,intimacy and communication. Ifpsychedelics do correspond with mysti-cism and esoteric Buddhism, some arguethat the empathogen MDMA could as the bodhisattva\u00d5s pharmaceutical.In my own research, I\u00d5ve encounteredmany folks that have included the sub-stance in their personal practice of loving-kindness. I remember an old Tricycle magazine interview written by Robert Forte I\u00d5d readsome time ago, which resurfaced in AlanHunt Badiner\u00d5s book, Zig Zag Zen, in which psychedelic shaman/researcher/BuddhistJack Kornfield said: \u00d2It is important to say that there is no Buddhist point of view on psychedelics.They are rarely found in the Buddhisttradition, if at all, and generally would belumped in the precepts under \u00d4intoxi-cants.\u00d5\u00d3 Kornfield feels officially that there is no common traditional point of viewabout the use of psychedelics in Buddhismitself, as there is very little written aboutthem. Forte reminds Kornfield of a story ofsomeone asking the Dalai Lama if onecould use drugs to attain enlightenment.His Holiness joked, \u00d2I sure hope so.\u00d3 Thebasic training precepts in Buddhism tellthe practitioner not to kill, steal, lie orengage in sexual misconduct, and lastly, torefrain from using intoxicants to the lossof mindfulness or loss of awareness. But entheogens can help create awareness. Using attorney or teenagerlogic, one could interpret that as \u00d2notsaying not to use them.\u00d3Without question, psychedelic usage, like crossing the street, can be dangerous.But I agree with Dr. Charles Tart\u2014notusing them can also be dangerous.Psychedelics alter the senses and canchallenge notions of authoritative control.They promote a worldview from a differ-ent vantage point than so-called \u00d2normal\u00d3western society. Then again, so doesmysticism. The left-hand path can be fullof disappointment, disassociation, things happen to eventhe most substance-free meditative mindwhen isolated. But we humans are wired for such states in our neurophysiologic makeup.Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), for example,is a powerful entheogenic substance thatexists naturally in the mammalian brain. Ifis already inside of us, is it really anintoxicant to be avoided? Regardless of whether it is induced by meditation or chemicals, what is reallyhappening when we have transcendentalexperiences? From the materialist\u00d5sviewpoint, mystical experiences aresimply a result of pathological and delu-sional brain dysfunction. Recent evidence,however, supports the hypothesis that thehuman brain\u00d5s temporal lobe plays a keyrole in producing mystical states ofconsciousness. Dr. Rick Strassman pointsout that certain brain centers and neuraltransmitters are mobilized in altered statesof consciousness and spiritual awareness,regardless of whether they are induced bythe ingestion of substances or by a controlof will. Fast forward through my own long strange trip and I currently find myself nota casualty of a drug war, but an adventurecapitalist: a responsible co-head of afamily, a business owner and founder of anon-profit organization. The psychedelicpath led me to my current status as a gradstudent getting my masters in Conscious-ness Studies, wherein I look less for God,but find G.O.D., the works of a GrandOrganizing Designer. I can now access myinner pharmacy through mindfulness,meditation and yoga. I had to lose myspirituality to find it. When I moved West,my heart and mind migrated East. Like Ifelt in the cave, it\u00d5s a small world after all. \u00a5 Without question, psychedelic usage, like crossing the street, can be dangerous. But I agree with Dr. Charles Tart- not using them can also be dangerous. m a p s v o l u m e x v i i n u m b e r 2 a u t u m n 2 o o 7 27 Rick Doblin, MAPS founder and President, earned his Ph.D. in Public Policy from the Kennedy School ofGovernment at Harvard University.Doblin was also in Stan and ChristinaGrof's first training group to receivecertification as a Holotropic Breath- work practitioner.
