Clinicians in the Foot and Ankle Center at Massachusetts General Hospital use these non-surgical treatments for foot and ankle conditions and currently offer the below with the goals of stimulating growth and healing: - Growth factors - Cytokines - Collagen - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - Amniotic-derived materials - Cell therapy The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Mass General is home to the latest innovations in surgical technology. Our practitioners are board-certified, Harvard Medical School-affiliated physicians with a shared goal to make the patient experience as smooth, fast, precise and painless as possible. You can feel confident in the care that you and your loved ones receive at Mass General and in the expert hands of our multidisciplinary Foot and Ankle team. A podiatrist from the team featured below will administer your orthobiologic treatments. Podiatrists have focused exclusively on the foot and ankle throughout their training and education, and also specialize in the dermatology and biomechanics of the foot. Mass General's teams of podiatrists and foot and ankle orthopedic surgeons are among the best in the nation. Risks & Benefits of Orthobiologic Medicine Orthobiologic medicines for the foot and ankle are fast and simple treatments sometimes recommended by clinicians as an alternative to surgery. Studies have shown some of the potential benefits of the use of orthobiologics include: - Non-steroidal - Promotes local healing - Acts as a potent anti-inflammatory - Reduces injury scarring - Recruits a patient's own cells - Fewer complications than surgery - Quicker recovery Some of the potential risks include: - Temporary pain and swelling at injection site - Injection site infection - Failure of treatment Foot and Ankle Conditions Treated by Orthobiologic Medicine Mass General podiatrists offer regenerative medicine procedures as an option for treating: - Arthritis - Bursitis - Diabetic foot ulcers - Venous stasis ulcers - Fat pad atrophy and associated metatarsalgia - Fibroma - Joint Pain in the foot and ankle - Metatarsalgia - Neuroma - Nonunions - Plantar fasciitis - Plantar plate injury - Porokeratosis - Tendonitis of the foot and ankle - Wounds (chronic and post-operative) To learn more about non-surgical options for foot and ankle, including orthobiologic medicine, call the Podiatry line of the Mass General Foot and Ankle Center at 617-726-3487. Our team offers a variety of foot and ankle treatments, including orthobiologic medicine, at both our main Boston campus and our convenient Waltham location. The team also offers virtual consultations and appointments as appropriate. Frequently Asked Questions about Orthobiologic Medicine Where do the tissues and cells used in orthobiologics come from? Tissues and cells used in orthobiologics can be autologous, meaning they come from the patient themselves. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a concentrated form of a patient's own blood, for example. Regardless of the source, the new cells produce building blocks, such as collagen and growth factors, that are part of the healing process. The actual cells introduced are rejected by your immune system after stimulating growth. Your provider can answer additional questions you have regarding the sources used for your specific treatment. Is orthobiologic medicine covered by my insurance? In some cases, but not always. Similar to wound treatment, the use of these treatments may be covered by insurance when specific indications are met. Some insurance companies may not cover certain procedures because they are still considered experimental. Patients should work closely with their insurance carriers to determine coverage limitations prior to receiving treatment. How long does an orthobiologic appointment take? Once you make an appointment, the doctor will evaluate your condition and suggest the appropriate treatment. Orthobiologic medicine is typically administered by injection and may be administered as soon as immediately following your consultation. PRP treatment involves drawing and concentrating your blood, and therefore takes a bit longer than a simple injection but is still a relatively fast outpatient treatment. How long does an orthobiologic treatment last? What if it doesn't work? The duration following treatment is variable. For wounds, treatment is completed with wound closure. For musculoskeletal conditions, more than one treatment may be required, and typically, the response to an injection lasts between 3 months and 1 year, although in some cases, a single injection is sufficient to resolve the condition. Your doctor will follow up with you after treatment to monitor healing and functional changes and may recommend additional treatments as necessary. How soon after an orthobiologic treatment for foot and ankle can I stand/walk? Orthobiologics are minimally invasive treatments. Typically, you should rest for one week following treatment. Your doctor will discuss a recovery plan and any activity limitations with you prior to your treatment. Is it safe to receive orthobiologic treatments during a pandemic? Mass General mandates masks for all patients and providers in accordance with state and federal guidelines and our Safe Care Commitment. Because we are treating your lower leg and/or foot, it will not be necessary to remove your mask during orthobiologic treatments. Follow up appointments can be done virtually and don't necessarily involve return trips to the doctor's office.
