Understanding, supporting, and tapping into its power are three pillars of healing and manifesting your true desires. Indigenous peoples understand the concept of the mind and body as one. It has been part of their belief and healing systems for thousands of years. Elaborate rituals often strengthen belief to make the mind work to heal the body. But there was more to it. They also understood that a healthy mind helps create a healthy body. A healthy body is important if you want a healthy mind. It is not only the body that needs healing, but sometimes the mind or spirit. The body may be sick, but the mind or spirit may be the reason. When that is the case, healing the mind brings healing to the body. These understandings have also shaped modern day mind body medicine as well. Experts used to believe that the mind was another name for your brain. Now they realize that your mind is also in your body. Our language speaks to this knowing. You say you have butterflies in your stomach to describe feeling anxious. Our intelligence goes far beyond the power of our brains. The brain communicates with the body, and the body communicates with the brain. You can also purposely influence your health and well-being via the mind body spirit connection. For example, resolving negative mental and emotional patterns releases stress and frees up healing energy. with the brain. Each affects the other on a continual basis. The beauty of working with the mind-body connection is not only in its ability to help you manifest improvements in your health, but to achieve more of what you want in other areas of your life, as well. At The Recovery House we not only understand this three-factor connection, but we also capitalize on its healing power. The first pillar of Recovery is to detoxify your body, which is a major step, allowing the other two factors to heal. But the hardest thing is yet to come. Following detox, we concentrate on strengthening your mind. The second pillar therefore is the group and individual therapy sessions, the 12-step program, and daily AA meetings that allow for your mind to understand and accept yourself with all your beauty and flaws. The third pillar will set you free and let your spirit fly. Modern science refers to it as the hormones that control your emotions and feelings. In the process of recovery, you learn to appreciate yourself and discover ways to redirect your sadness and depression, and ultimately replace it with belief in your ability to overcome and carry on as a fully balanced, healthy individual with short and long-term goals in mind.
