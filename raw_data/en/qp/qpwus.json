Barely did they take a deep breath before the headquarters staff was again off and running, planning two major September events. One of them was our fourth Futures Summit. The other was the conference on Mastering the CMS Regulations: Implica- tions for Infection Prevention and Control. Let me explain about our futures summits. As you know, the role of the APIC board is to provide direction on governance, strategic planning and quality outcomes. Several years ago, it became clear to us that we needed input from leaders other than infection preventionists t o help us understand how we were perceived and what we needed to do to shape our future, rather than have it shaped for us. Under the leadership of Kathy Warye, APIC'S CEO, we have held four annual summits that have proven extremely valuable. One of the most visible outcomes of a summit is the presence of a non-infection preventionist on our board. This addition has been invaluable in bringing an outside perspective that was lacking, and in 2009, we look forward to having two external directors. The transition in title from ICP to to infection preventionist and the change in APIC's logo and tagline were also outcomes of a futures summit. This year's event brought together key leaders in healthcare and industry to help develop strategic initiatives for APIC, and our industry colleagues were instrumental in providing support for this very important function. The most recent event was the conference on Mastering the CMS Regulations: Implications for Infection Prevention and Control. This was an outstanding conference attended by more than 300 healthcare professionals, including infection preventionists, physicians, and quality managers. We had the unique opportunity to hear from Don Wright, MD, MPH, principal deputy assistant secretary for health with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Infection preventionists have taken the lead in creating change, as it applies to infection prevention, within their organizations. They have done this by working collaboratively with the bedside caregivers and healthcare providers. This focused approach has made a tremendous impact on our ability to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. In much the same way, the Department of Health and Human Services has created a Reducing HAIs Steering Committee. This construct brings together key government-based organizations, including the CDC, CMS, AHRQ, ONC and OPHS, to provide focus and drive to reducing HAIs. The committee's timeline is short, so watch for more to come, and see page 22 for an article by Dr. Wright addressing the subject of infection prevention. We also heard from CMS on the Implementation of Value Based Purchasing. It will be interesting to watch this intriguing approach of not paying for poor quality - and providing organizations with incentives to improve - play out. Of one thing we are certain: the life of the infection preventionist has just become more challenging. Success is absolutely dependent on an organizational focus of infection prevention being everyone's job.

Latter SENIOR MEDICAL WRITER James Battaglio GRAPHIC DESIGN DEF Design ADVERTISING Kris Carey Prevatte APIC's mission is to improve health and patient safety by reducing risks of infection and other adverse outcomes. The association's more than 12,000 members have primary responsibility for infection prevention, control and hospital epidemiology in healthcare settings around the globe.

CEO's Message Prevention strategist WINTER 2008 VOLUME 1 NUMBER 4 As one year comes to a close and another begins, I am struck not only by the number of signi cant changes that have occurred in our envi- ronment in the past 12 months, but also by the pace of those develop- ments. T o say we are experiencing a paradigm shift in healthcare and, more speci cally, in the approach to infection prevention and control, would not be an overstatement. The march of public reporting efforts to new states, the introduction of federal legislation and expansion of requirements in states where reporting is already law underscore the growing power of the patient and the lay public in driving transparency and efforts to improve the quality of care. The new CMS rule has introduced an era of nancial accountability, making the prevention of a host of adverse events not only a desirable outcome but a condition of nancial sustainability for our nation's healthcare institutions. The change in focus from control to prevention, from treatment of infections to setting the target of zero preventable HAIs, is perhaps the most profound of all the recent changes that our community has embraced and led. Profound change is often accompanied by both outer shifts (changes in processes, practices and systems) as well as inner shifts (changes in people's values, aspirations and behaviors). Re- cent shifts in our larger environment have created unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate the value of infection prevention and control. With the new CMS rule, infection preventionists will shift the perspective of their healthcare leaders from the old view of infection control as a cost center to the role infection prevention must play as a key driver in the institution's nancial health and sustainability. The integration of infection prevention across the institution in order to reach and sustain ambitious goals will create opportunities for today's preventionist to become tomorrow's expert consultant in the delivery of increased quality and improved patient outcomes. A growing number of organizations are advocating that preventionists must have routine access to C-level executives and, potentially, the institution's governing boards. As this shift plays out, it is anticipated that preventionists will become expert consultants to leadership and all those who deliver patient care and services. Just as preventionists are taking on an increased level of responsibility and learning new ways of doing things, so too is APIC not only doing new things, but doing so in new and different ways to en sure that the association has the necessary structures, systems and strategy to support the evolving needs and aspirations of the infection prevention community. An article entitled \"Looking Forward, Looking Back,\" on page 18, provides a review of 2008 and some of our many initiatives to educate, communicate and lead the rapidly evolving infection prevention community - as well as a preview of some of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the coming year. Whatever 2009 may bring, we are con dent that APIC, and its skilled and dedicated members on the front lines of infection prevention, will be more than up to the task. Sincerely, Kathy Warye, APIC CEO A Year of Transformation BY KATHY WARYE Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 9 Capitol Comments BY DENISE GRAHAM , APIC EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, LISA TOMLINSONDIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS,ANDNANCY HAILPERNASSISTANT DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS 10 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistAmbulatory Surgery Centers Now the Focus of Legislative Attention Examples of such bills that we have seen in the past legislative session include: \u0081 AB 2122 (CA) would establish CMS standards of coverage as a requirement for ASCs to become licensed. The bill includes conditions for coverage relating to infection prevention. \u0081 A 2658 (NJ) would extend existing legislation surrounding MRSA control and HAI reporting to ASCs and nursing homes. \u0081 HB 61 (GA) and SB 183 (KY 2008), and HB 67 (KY 2009) include ASCs in their requirements for healthcare facilities to institute infection control policies. \u0081 HB 168 (MD) proposes a comparable evaluation system for outpatient surgery (hospital or ASC) information, as is already required for inpatient surgery. To date, none of these bills has been enacted. However, they certainly indicate legislative interest in the increased regulation of ASCs. Professional Misconduct and Enhanced Infection Control Training Laws New York legislators took a different approach, focusing the regulations and requirements on healthcare providers, rather than the healthcare facilities. Bills were introduced in response to unsafe practices that had occurred in the state, placing patients at risk. S 8104 included provisions requiring enhanced infection prevention training for medical professionals. S 8298 , which was enacted in August, included a similar enhanced training provision, but focused primarily on intensifying the state's ability to prosecute medical professionals for professional misconduct if they put patients at risk by violating safe infection prevention practices. Both bills included provisions addressing the issue of safe injection practices.With the increased number of medical procedures now being performed outside of traditional healthcare settings comes the understandable concern that infection prevention processes must keep pace with this new trend if patients are to be protected from hepatitis and other infections. Highly publicized breakdowns of standard procedures in outpatient and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) in New York, Nevada and other states have put thousands of patients at risk for infection, causing legislators to consider public policy as a means of addressing this threat. The result, over the past year, has been a trend toward state legislation addressing infection-related issues in the outpatient setting. However, the approaches to legislation related to infection prevention and control practices in ambulatory settings vary. ASC Licensing and Regulation Some legislators have sought to address the issue by introducing bills that would extend licensing requirements and regulations to ASCs and other types of outpatient facilities. Under this proposed legislation, non-traditional facilities would come under the same umbrella as hospitals in terms of required safe practices, often as a condition of licensure or to qualify for Medicare, Medicaid, or speci ed state funds. APIC routinely monitors federal government proposals relating to infection prevention procedures for the opportunity to provide expert input into areas that would impact infection preventionists.

October 27, 2008 Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 11Capitol CommentsWASHINGTON D.C. Bus Driver Has TB, 762 Riders Told ILLINOIS Exotic pets can be hazardous for children A DRIVER FOR Metro Washington's van service for the elderly and disabled has tuberculosis, and as many as 762 riders might have been exposed to the disease, Metro of cials announced in December. The D.C. Department of Health, which learned of the diagnosis because of mandatory reporting laws, noti ed the transit agency of the infection on Oct. 29, 2008, as soon as TB was con rmed. Metro of cials said they took the driver off the road on Oct. 14, when they suspected that he might have the contagious disease, but didn't send warning letters to riders of the bus until Nov. 19. TB can cause severe respiratory illness and even death if left untreated. Health departments in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia are \"aggressiv ely\" f ollo wing up with those people, said Shannon Hader, the D.C. Health Department of cial in charge of the city' s tuberculosis program. It's believed that about 100 passengers were exposed long enough to be at risk of contracting the disease, but Hader said the risk is low, even for the frail or elderly, since transmission typically occurs through very close and repeated contact. She noted that the driver's tuberculosis was \"regular, old-fashioned TB,\" not the drug-resistant variety. Metro was able to identify the 762 potentially exposed passengers because the service typically picks up people at their homes and their addresses are on le, said Angela Gates, a Metro spokeswoman. She said the three-week lapse between learning of the infection from the health department and notifying riders occurred because Metro was waiting for guidance from D.C. health of cials. But Hader disputed that, saying the delay was more likely due to the time it took for Metro to nd the pertinent names and addresses. Gates said the driver is being treated and is expected to return to work. Virginia reported 306 active cases of tuberculosis in 2007, and Maryland reported 253 cases in 2006, the most recent years for which statistics for those states are available. \u2014The Washington Post WARNING: YOUNG CHILDREN should not keep hedgehogs as pets - or hamsters, baby chicks, lizards and turtles - because of risks for disease. That's according to North America's leading pediatricians' group in a new report about dangers from exotic animals. Besides evidence that they can carry dangerous and sometimes potentially deadly germs, exotic pets may be more prone than cats and dogs to bite, scratch or claw, putting children younger than ve particularly at risk, the report says. Young children are vulnerable because of developing immune systems - plus, they often put their hands in their mouths. That means families with children younger than ve should avoid owning \"non-traditional\" pets. Also, kids that young should avoid contact with these animals in petting zoos or other public places, says the report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, based at Elk Grove Village, Illinois. The report appears in the October edition of the group's medical journal, Pediatrics .\"Many parents clearly don't understand the risks from various infections\" these animals often carry, said Dr. Larry Pickering, the report's lead author and an infectious disease specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 11 per cent of salmonella illnesses in children are thought to stem from contact with lizards, turtles and other reptiles, Dr. Pickering said. Hamsters also carry the germ, which may cause severe diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.Salmonella has also been found in baby chicks, and young children can get it by kissing or touching the animals and then putting their hands in their mouths. Study co-author Dr. Joseph Bocchini said he recently treated an infant who got salmonella from the family's pet iguana, which was allowed to roam freely. The child was hospitalized for four weeks but recovered, said Dr. Bocchini, head of the academy's infectious diseases committee and pediatrics chairman at Louisiana State University in Shreveport. Hedgehogs can be dangerous because their quills can penetrate skin and have been known to spread a bacteria germ that can cause fever, stomach pain and a rash. With supervision and precautions like hand washing, contact between children and animals \"is a good thing,\" Dr. Bocchini said. But families should wait until children are older before bringing home an exotic pet, he said, adding that those who already have these pets should contact their veterinarians about speci c risks and possible new homes for the animals. - The Associated Press National News Briefs 12 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistFLORIDA MRSA killed student-athlete AN OSCEOLA COUNTY high schoo l f oo tball p la y er died of a bacterial infection that can't be treated with many common antibiotics, health of cials have said. Alonzo Smith, 18, linebacker for Liberty High School, died September 29, 2008 at Osceola Regional Medical Center, the Osceola County Health Department said. County health of cials quickly con rmed that the cause was Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Since then, a second Liberty High football player has also been diagnosed with MRSA. Thomas Biejansky, 17, spent a week in hospital before being released. Smith had gone to the hospital with back spasms, and was treated and released, only to return later with a rash and labored breathing that got worse. Many people carry MRSA on their skin or inside their noses. The bacteria contaminate many public surfaces. \"It's on tray tables on airplanes and railings in subways, and there's an incredible amount of MRSA on doorknobs,\" said Dr. Michael Muszynski, an infectious disease specialist and dean of Florida State University's medical school campus in Orlando. Athletes can become infected because of cuts and nicks they pick up during competition, wounds that give the bacteria a pathway into the body, he said. Con ned to the skin, MRSA is usually treatable. The danger rises when the infection spreads to the bloodstream. \"It's important for athletes to report any injuries to their trainer or team physician and get them cleaned up and dressed,\" Dr. Muszynski said, noting t hat MRSA can escalate quickly if not treated early. He also stressed the importance of washing down surfaces in sporting facilities and cleaning equipment. Liberty Coach Doug Nichols said Smith made an immediate impact on the team when he transferred this year from Landmark Christian School in Haines City. He was a leader, Nichols said. \"That kid would light up the whole room with his smile,\" he said. \"You never heard a bad word out of him.\" - The Orlando Sentinel\"It's important for athletes to report any injuries to their trainer or team physician and get them cleaned up and dressed,\" Dr. Muszynski said, noting that MRSA can escalate quickly if not treated early. Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 13 ENGLAND Nanotechnology Versus the Superbugs AUSTRALIA Pig Workers Get Heart InfectionSCIENTISTS FROM THE London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN) at University College London are using a novel nanomechanical approach to investigate the workings of Vancomycin, one of the few antibiotics that can combat increasingly antibiotic-resistant infections like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). According to the October 12 issue of the Nature Nanotechnology journal, researchers led by Dr. Rachel McKendry and Professor Gabriel Aeppli developed ultra- sensitive probes capable of providing new insight into how antibiotics work, paving the way to develop more effective new drugs. Dr. McKendry, Joseph Ndieyira, Moyu Watari and coworkers used cantilever a rr a y s - t i n y l e v e r s n o w i d e r than a human hair - to examine the process which ordinarily takes place in the body when Vancomycin binds itself to the surface of the bacteria. They coated the cantilever array with mucopeptides from bacterial cell walls and found that as the antibiotic attaches itself, it generates a surface stress on the bacteria which can be detected by a tiny bending of the levers. The team suggests that this stress contributes to the disruption of the cell walls and the breakdown of the bacteria. The interdisciplinary team then compared how Vancomycin interacts with both non-resistant and resistant strains of bacteria. The \"superbugs\" are resistant to antibiotics because of a simple mutation, which deletes a single hydrogen bond from the structure of their cell walls. This small change makes it approximately 1,000 times harder for the antibiotic to attach itself to the bug, leaving it much less able to disrupt the cells' structure, and therefore therapeutically ineffective. Generally, \"the cell wall o f t h e s e b u g s i s w e a k e n e d by the antibiotic, ultimately killing the bacteria,\" said Dr. McKendry. \"Our research on cantilever sensors suggests that the cell wall is disrupted by a combination of local antibiotic- mucopeptide binding and the spatial mechanical connectivity of these events. Investigating both these binding and mechanical infl uences on the cells' structure could lead to the development of more powerful and effective antibiotics in future.\" \"This work at the LCN demonstrates the effectiveness of silicon-based cantilevers for drug-screening applications,\" added Aeppli, director of the LCN. \"According to the Health Protection Agency, during 2007 there were about 7,000 cases of MRSA and more than 1,000 cases of VRE (Vancomycin- resistant enterococci ) in England alone. In recent decades, the introduction of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, but without effective new drugs, the number of these fatal infections will increase.\" - EurekAlert AUSTRALIAN DOCTORS AT Canberra Hospital have treated a 46-year-old woman and a 58-year-old man, both from New South Wales, for fevers, sweating and severe weight loss caused by endocarditis, a serious condition where bacteria settle on the valves of the heart and spread infection throughout the body. The woman required a heart valve replacement to survive. The bacterium, called Streptococcus suis , is common in pigs and can be caught b y humans through contact with live or dead pigs, although the exact mechanism for transmission is unknown. It has caused large-scale death among humans, most recently in 2005 when 215 Chinese butchers and meat processors became infected, and more than half of them died. Only two previous cases have been reported in Australia, the rst in 1993 and a second in April 2007, when a 41- year-old Melbourne meat processor developed toxic shock syndrome from the bug. Canberra Hospital' s infectious diseases physician, Dr . Karina Kennedy, said that with four reported cases, the strain is emerging as a serious hazard for Australian piggery workers.\"These cases show that it is an occupational hazard in Australian piggeries, with potential public health, animal health and medico- legal implications,\" Dr. Kennedy said in the latest Medical Journal of Australia . The journal has detailed the latest cases, revealing that the woman developed fatigue and anorexia, and lost 20 kilograms in the months before she was diagnosed in October 2006, and required an operation to replace her severely damaged aortic valve. The man, who was from the same unnamed town, presented to the hospital in January 2008 with headache, fevers, neck stiffness and confusion, but recovered after drug treatment. Paul Seale, a professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Sydney, said the cases should be a wake-up call for health authorities. \"On the back of this, we need occupational health and safety experts to go into these piggeries and rigorously examine ways in which the workers can be better protected from this exposure before it happens again,\" he said. - National Nine News International News Briefs 14 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategist UNew faster t testing times USimpler and easier to use UOSHA-compliant for all respirators, including N95 The P ORTACOUNT\u00ae PROFit Tester is more than a piece of equipment.

BY KATHY WARYE, APIC CEO AND DENISE GRAHAM, APIC EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTrecognized as a voice of authority in the eld of infection prevention and control, and is increasingly sought out for its professional e x p e r t i s e . O v e r t h e p a s t 1 2 m o n t h s , APIC's relationships with both national and international partners have strengthened - and in an effort to further broaden its reach, the association has established a for-pro t consulting arm providing strategic guidance and practical assistance to a wide range of c lients, including regional healthcare systems, private enterprise and foreign governments. On the U.S. government scene, APIC continues to be very actively involved in seeking to infl uence policy makers to provide adequate resources, select meaningful measures and position the profession appropriately. Our Public Policy Department works very closely with many governmental agencies, ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A key shift in the U.S. infection prevention landscape for 2008 was the development of a regulatory change by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Effective this year, CMS will no longer provide hospitals with reimbursement for the increased costs of care associated w ith a n u m b e r o f H A I s d e e m e d \" r e a s o n a b l y preventable\" under its Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) 2008 nal rule. APIC was a very vocal partner in providing CMS with influential expert comments around the nal rule, succeeding in ensuring that the infections chosen were preventable. A sold-out conference in September helped members and C-level leadership prepare for this new rule. APIC's leadership believes the focus on infection prevention will only intensify in 2009. As a result, we will continue to work in delivering educational opportunities, practice guidance, and other resources to better protect patients. Our educational outreach to members is extensive, with considerable emphasis on our Targeting Zero initiative, aimed at lowering HAIs to an irreducible min imum. As a part of the 2008 initiative, APIC hosted several conferences, provided 25 free webinars and produced two elimination guides, with more to come in 2009. These elimination guides give APIC members comprehensive, up-to- the-minute practice guidance in preventing speci c types of infection. For 35 years, APIC has excelled at translating the science in complementary fashion with CDC, SHEA, ASHES and other organizations. F e e d b a c k f r o m t h e m e m b e r s h i p h a s shown that our elimination guides have had a tremendous impact in acute care settings. Sixty-eight percent of U.S. healthcare facilities are using the guides, and results from our Pace of Progress polls show interventions have risen by a dramatic 76 percent since the MRSA guide's release in 20 07. Because the terms MRSA and C. diff have become part of the public vernacular and a common subject within the mainstream press, APIC has stepped up its efforts to promote and support its members as the healthcare professionals best equipped to offer effective front-line response, thereby driving organizational change. Moving forward, APIC will provide additional quality improvement and process improvement resources to the profession. Another major milestone in 2008 was our nine-month strategic marketing and imaging campaign, which produced a new logo, tagline and name for the profession: infection preventionist. Replacing \"infection control Looking Back THE PAST YEAR has been another momentous one for APIC. Rapid shifts in the healthcare environment have run the gamut from the emergence of virulent new pathogens to the development of signi cant public policy changes, resulting in an increasingly active and infl uential role for APIC in national and global infection prevention efforts. At the same time, APIC's leadership has undertaken a wide range of strategic initiatives as part of its continuing efforts to help preventionists raise the bar in their ght against infectious disease. With the rising incidence of Methicillin- resistant Staphylcoccus aureus (MRSA), C. diff, and a long line of other dangerous microorganisms, and an increasing number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, the challenges continue to mount. As a result of the growing prominence and visibility of infection prevention, new organizations continue to emerge, creating an extremely crowded marketplace. In a d d i t i o n t o i t s gr o w th i n s tr e n g th and stature, APIC continues to be widely APIC >> FAST FORWARD 18 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistprofessional\" or ICP, the new term joins the list of such professional titles as hospitalists, intensivists and interventionists, coined by the healthcare industry over the past few years. Members embraced this new term, which was released simultaneously with the unveiling of APIC's modernized logo and new tag line: \"Spreading Knowledge. Preventing Infection.\" A dedicated web site allows chapter access to branding materials and guidance on their use. The campaign placed greater emphasis on the expanding role of both APIC and its members, and underscored preventionists' critical role in deterring infection on a daily basis. While organizations examine the impact of infections on public health, it's our membership who limits the transmission of disease and eradicates H AIs. It' s important to note that APIC could not deliver the same level of resources were it not for the support received from its 20 corporate partners, who make possible everything from conferences to elimination guides. Over the past ve years, the association has signi cantly increased and diversi ed its revenue stream so we are able to offer a greater continuum of education.APIC plans to continue that trend in 2009 by offering members e-learning, thereby delivering education to our members' desktops. And so we look forward to accelerating these efforts in 2009.

She said the fact that so many entities are discovering the need for additional advice in the eld of IP to ld APIC's leadership \"the time was right\" to introduce the new service. Recognizing that ACSI has entered a crowded eld, 2008 APIC President, Jan Frain, said that despite this fact, the association's l ea d e r shi p s e es AP I C as \"th e g o- t o o r g aniza ti o n f o r inf e cti o n preventionists.\" Going Global In a move designed to offer its infection prevention (IP) services to a variety of worldwide healthcare and private entities, APIC's newest venture - APIC Consulting Services, Inc. (ACSI) - provides acute, ambulatory, and long-term care facilities, hospital systems, insurance companies and governments with a wide range of expertise. ACSI focuses on several areas - strategies to reduce MDROs, state and federal regulatory compliance and accreditation, program evaluation and outbreak recovery. Although the wholly owned subsidiary is a APIC's new consulting entity is reaching out to help prevent infection worldwide. BY JAMES BATTAGLIOAPIC >> FAST FORWARD 20 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategist\"As a healthcare professional, I'd want an experienced association like APIC to assess my infection prevention program,\" said Frain. \"Professional organizations are only there to help you. They're collegial, not adversarial.\" Warye said APIC's vast majority of consultant members are solo practitioners and that the association's intent \"is not to compete with them,\" but to instead take larger opportunities within healthcare systems, alternate settings, states or foreign governments. She used as an example ACSI's recent work with an ambulatory care system. Currently, ACSI has a project being undertaken with 65 hospitals under the auspices of the California Hospital Association Infection Prevention Initiative, providing a host of best practices and 200 hours of consulting services. \" Blue Shield of California was our rst client,\" said Warye. She said APIC found there were very few entities able to take on the sheer volume of work of which ACSI is capable. \"Acting in a consulting capacity to take on large-scale work for a system, or develop large-scale MDRO elimination strategies and/or programs, is what we're interested in doing. We can help with compliance with The Joint Commission guidelines, CMS regulations and state regulatory compliance requirements,\" said Warye. Echoing Warye's remarks, Frain explained that infection prevention is \"not a eld that draws people naturally\u2014 most of the time it's by default...it's a specialty niche.\" Both Frain and Warye said ACSI's clientele is not limited to ho spitals, but provides services in any kind of care setting\u2014including ambulatory care, \"where we're absolutely needed, as is witnessed by the Nevada incident,\" said Warye.

Approximately 1.7 million HAIs occur in U.S. hospitals each year, and are associated with 99,000 deaths, impacting 5 percent to 10 percent of hospitalized patients annually. In addition to the tremendous toll on human life, the nancial burden attributed to healthcare-associated infection is staggering. Based on estimates, HAIs may add as much as $20 billion to healthcare costs each year. The reduction of HAIs is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). And the good news is that many of these deaths are preventable, and society's costs are reduced, through increased awareness and implementation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended clinical infection control practices. HHS is developing an initiative to address HAIs as an important public health and patient safety issue. The rst step in this initiative is to bring together the department's full resources to address this critical issue and improve HHS coordination. Several agencies have signi cant roles in addressing this important public health challenge, including the CDC, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Of ce of Public Health and Science (OPHS). There are many examples of how these agencies have worked collaboratively on this issue. For instance, in scal year 2008, AHRQ was appropriated $5 million to implement a new initiative in collaboration with CDC and CMS that identi es gaps in the prevention and management of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) related infections across the health system. It also funds research and implementation, measurement, and evaluation practices that mitigate infections. The three agencies have already completed an analysis of their individual ongoing MRSA efforts nationwide, the needs of speci c populations and the availability of resources needed to enhance prevention efforts. As part of its commitment to improve the quality of care received during a hospital stay, and to make sure that Medicare only pays for items and services that are reasonable and necessary, CMS is adopting payment policies that will encourage hospitals to reduce the likelihood of HAIs. Medicare will no longer pay hospitals at a higher rate for the increased costs of care that result when a patient is harmed by one of the reasonably preventable listed conditions as identi ed in the Inpatient Prospective Payment System FY 2008 nal rule, if it was hospital-acquired. HHS has also undertaken multiple efforts to address issues related to reducing HAIs. Among these efforts is a departmental initiative led by the Of ce of Public Health and Science to increase infl uenza vaccination among healthcare workers. Infl uenza accounts for an average of 36,000 excess deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Despite the documented bene ts of healthcare worker infl uenza vaccination on patient outcomes and healthcare worker absenteeism, and on reducing infl uenza infection among staff, vaccination coverage among healthcare workers remains low (i.e., less than 45 percent). Targeting healthcare workers is an important approach for expanding infl uenza vaccine use, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Accordingly, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Health has launched an interagency taskforce to discuss current activities promoting and providing healthcare worker infl uenza vaccination for the 2008-2009 fl u season. In addition, in June 2008, HHS Deputy Secretary Tevi Troy established the HHS Steering Committee for Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections. I have been asked to chair this important departmental p anel. The committee is charged with developing an HHS action plan to reduce HAIs by enhancing and coordinating HHS-supported efforts, including the development of prevention guidelines, data collection and analysis, and outreach and education. The committee will concentrate on the leading HAIs: urinary tract and surgical site infections, bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridium dif cile and MRSA. Establishing a working relationship with organizations like APIC is important because we recognize that reducing HAIs nationally is a shared responsibility for all levels of government, the healthcare industry, and consumers. Reducing HAIs is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. BY DR. DON WRIGHT, MD, MPH PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESAPIC >> FAST FORWARD 22 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistThese efforts help HHS provide greater national leadership and coordination. The effort includes: Establishment of the HHS Steering Committee to develop an HHS action plan In partnership with the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) - the Secretary's advisory committee charged with providing him advice and guidance on the practice of infection control - HHS will begin to prioritize the current 1,200 recommended clinical practices to facilitate rapid implementation among healthcare organizations. The HICPAC has provided recommendations for the development of evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of healthcare- associated infections by HAI type (i.e. surgical site, etc.) Identify and explore policy incentives for regulatory oversight of recommended clinical practices through hospital accreditation programs Establish greater consistency and compatibility of HAI data through developing standardized de nitions and measures for HAIs Build on the principles of transparency and consumer choice to empower consumers to motivate healthcare organizations and providers to provide better, more ef cient care In addition, this plan will outline opportunities for collaboration with external stakeholders, like the Association for Professionals in Infection Control (APIC). HHS staff recently met with APIC Executive Director Kathy Warye at HHS headquarters in Washington, DC. HHS is excited to work with organizations, like APIC, that are dedicated to improving health and patient safety by reducing risks of infection and other adverse outcomes. She shared APIC's upcoming plans with HHS staff members and also emphasized the association's commitment to prom oting the prevention of HAIs. They also discussed a number of areas in which they can work together, including participating in APIC scienti c conferences, sending electronic updates on HHS activities to APIC members, and inviting HHS participation at other APIC events as participants and speakers to discuss HAI issues. Establishing a working relationship with organizations like APIC is important because we recognize that reducing HAIs nationally is a shared responsibility for all levels of government, the healthcare industry, and consumers. The HHS Steering Committee will ensure appropriate stakeholder input into developing and implementing its departmental action plan. Through the Steering Committee outreach efforts, we hope to learn more about other organizations' various campaigns and initiatives that are already addressing HAIs. HAIs continue to take a signi cant toll on human life. The HHS Steering Committee on Reducing HAIs is an unprecedented opportunity to bring together the department's full resources to bear on this critical patient safety issue. In addition, the Steering Committee will encourage engagement with external stakeholders like APIC to achieve signi cant and sustainable success. Our hope is that this concerted and focused effort will help to create a healthier America by reducing HAIs, improving patient safety and lowering healthcare costs.

The survey was conducted by APIC and the Premier healthcare alliance. APIC-Premier Survey on HAI Prevention Strategies. The full 7-page survey can be found online at www.premierinc.com/ about/news/08-sep/APIC-premier-survey.jsp.Only 15% of survey respondents indicated that executive and physician leadership are actively engaged and leading the charge against infections in their facilities, though 30.3% of respondents suggested executives and physicians are the most important resource to meet HAI challenges. Asked how HAI data are shared between infection preventionists and executives, 57.6% of respondents cited regular agenda discussions at board meetings, but only 15.3% said senior leadership provides feedback and recommendations. \"The effect of HAIs annually on U.S. hospitals is staggering: Two million patients infected; 90,000 deaths, more than one death every six minutes; excess costs of nearly $6 billion,\" said APIC CEO Kathy Warye. \"Healthcare leaders must make infection prevention a priority and allocate resources to efforts that target institution-wide prevention, education, measurement and process improvements.\" Survey respondents, which included quality, safety, risk management and infection preventionists representing all types and sizes of hospitals, cited removing unnecessary indwelling urinary catheters (55.5%), a practice that prevents urinary tract infections (UTIs), as the most c hallenging HAI prevention intervention to implement. Measuring compliance with hand hygiene practices recommended by the CDC was also identi ed by 35.5% of the respondents as a signi cant challenge. \"Improving compliance with infection prevention practices requires integration of these practices into the daily tasks of all clinicians,\" said Premier Safety Institute Vice President Gina Pugliese, RN, MS. \"This necessitates a redesign of our systems and processes, such as the use of checklists for critical tasks or strategically placed alcohol- based hand rub dispensers.\"In terms of optimizing response to changes in the CMS reimbursement policy for certain healthcare-associated conditions, respondents said accurate and/or appropriate physician documentation of patient records (51.6%) and coding, including accurate use of new present on admission (POA) codes (20.2%), nee d the most attention. \"The accurate identi cation and coding of HAIs is going to be challenging without collaboration across multiple areas of the hospital,\" said Daniel Varga, MD, chief medical of cer at SSM Health Care. \"Executive leadership needs to work with doctors, nurses, and infection prevention and control staff to ensure that these teams drive system design and culture change.\" To access the survey, visit www.premierinc.com/about/news/08-sep/APIC- premier-survey.jsp.\" Improving compliance with infection prevention practices requires integration of these practices into the daily tasks of all clinicians.\" APIC >> FAST FORWARD > NEWS 28 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistOur passive safety technology: sDeploys automatically sCannot be bypassed sPromotes compliance Arrange for a trial today!

Even before the infamous September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America occurred, Wanda Lamm had the foresight to see the importance of teaching bioterrorism preparedness. \"I went to a North Carolina APIC conference in which there was a tabletop preparedness drill, and I got to thinking, 'We need to do something like this in our area,' \" said Lamm, R N , B S N , C I C , A P I C ' s A u g u s t H e r o o f Infection Prevention and the infection control coordinator for Nash Healthcare Systems, Rocky Mount, NC. \"So in August of 2001, we had a community- wide drill with all our partners. We had experienced Hurricane Floyd here, so that was a good learning experience.\" The participating agencies formed a bioterrorism committee that has since expanded into two committees: the Nash County Disaster Preparedness Committee and the Nash County Pandemic Flu Preparedness Committee. Both continue to meet quarterly, and are composed of representatives from the hospital, city and county law enforcement, re department, EMS, home and mental health agencies, the public school system, the Red C r o ss , Uni t e d W a y , N as h Co un ty Pu b li c Health Department and local businesses. Lamm and her two-person staff, including another CIC nurse, are major champions of education in both their hospital and their community. Over the past six years, Lamm's work has focused on pandemic fl u and bioterrorism preparedness. She teaches classes on pandemic fl u preparedness in local businesses, churches and area community service organizations, the Girl Scouts and physicians' of ces. She also implemented a pamphlet on the subject for the public; it was distributed to children in Nash County public schools to take home to their parents. \"There have been other, smaller incidences that occurred over the years,\" said Lamm. \"Just having that partnership with the other agencies, which continues to this day, has helped play such a vital role in our preparedness efforts.\" Her hard work has united her community and helped make Nash County the leader in bioterrorism and pandemic fl u preparedness in North Carolina. Subgroups have sprung out of the local Emergency Planning Committee, which meets quarterly. They, along with new groups such as the United Way, mental health and agricultural agencies, and the Red Cross, plan for pandemics. \"Our emergency manager and EMS manager were involved in this effort early on,\" said Lamm. \"As the need arises, we talk with other people and other agencies. Public health and emergency management are leading the effort now.\" Asked if she feels her community is well- prepared for an event such as a pandemic, thanks to the ongoing efforts of all these agencies, Lamm said, \"I honestly don't know if anyone can say they're in good shape if a pandemic strikes.\" SILVIA ACOSTA-GNASS Preventing Infection An Argentinian biochemist achieves dramatic reductions in SSI and MRSA rates. Silvia Acosta-Gnass, MSc, CIC \u2014 a native of Argentina where she is a biochemist at the 180-bed Sanatorio Adventista del Plata Libertador San Martin-Entre Rios teaching hospital \u2014 has serv ed as director of the Infection Control Service since the program's inception 11 years ago. Her greatest challenge, and that of her three-nurse infection control staff, has come in reducing SSI and MRSA rates by implementing proper surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis among surgeons, anesthetists, nurses and pharmacy personnel. Yet as a result of her success in this arena, she had been named APIC's September 2008 Hero of Infection Prevention. By training the nursing and medical staff in small groups, Silvia has improved hand hygiene compliance and surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis usage, helping to reduce general surgery SSI rates from 7.6% to 1.3% within her primarily surgical healthcare facility. Orthopedic surgery SSI rates have been reduced from 7.8% to 1.3%, while gynecological surgery SSI rates dropped from 1.8% in the year 2000 to 0.6% in 2006. \"Our goal is to continue the diminution of infection in both general and orthopedic surgical site infection rates,\" said Acosta-Gnass, whose title of biochemist is the equivalent of a clinical pathologist in the United States. \"We've never had a single case of VRE due to our strict isolation practices.\"The hospital's rates of nosocomial bacteremia incidences dropped from to 20.9% in 2006, while nosocomial MRSA bacteremia rates fell from 3.4 per 1,000 discharges in 1995 to 0.6 per 1,000 discharges in 2006. Despite facing economic crises, budget cuts, and limited resources, Acosta-Gnass and her staff continue to work to overcome these obstacles and to attain their goal of reducing the risk of nosocomial infections. \"Education is the core,\" she said. \"It's very dif cult, but I think we can continue to improve patient outcomes.\"HEROESHEROESHEROES 32 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention MUELLER Working Together A mentoring relationship leads to dramatic reductions in infection, and major cost savings, at two Nebraska hospitals. APIC's two November Heroes of Infection Prevention have found their Greater Omaha APIC Chapter to be not only the source of valuable information necessary to their profession, but also the seed of a deep-rooted friendship that sprang from a mentoring relationship. Sandra Vyhlidal, RN, MSN, CIC, infection control coordinator at Nebraska Methodist Hospital in Omaha, and Shawn Mueller, RN, MSN, CIC, environmental epidemiologist at Bryan Lincoln General Hospital (LGH) Medical Center in Lincoln, Nebraska, began a mentoring relationship in 2000 that continues to some degree even now, years after Shawn joined APIC's Greater Omaha Chapter. Sandra's prof essional guidance has had a signi cant impact on Shawn's career and has provided an example of what it truly means to be an APIC chapter member.\"I was an experienced infection control practitioner who had implemented a successful preventative strategy that was of interest to Shawn,\" said Vyhlidal. \"Drawn together by this mutual interest of improving surgical patients' outcomes, we developed a strong relationship, both professionally and personally. Shawn's hospital was experiencing surgical site infections (SSI), and she and I discussed my project of implementing antimicrobial gauze dressings, designed to reduce SSI. Because my experience was so successful, Shawn decided to use the same product and she had the same success. The project for both hospitals produced a positive patient outcome, as well as being cost effective.\" Research into the impact of antimicrobial gauze dressings and surgical site infections in their respective hospitals united Vyhlidal and Mueller in their goal of reaching zero tolerance. Vyhlidal's project, now in its seventh year, still enjoys a low infection rate. Her implementation of gauze dressings in selected surgical procedures resulted in SSI rates decreasing from 4.5% to 0.4% over ve years, saving her hospital more than $800,000. This initiative was expanded to all surgical patients. Mueller's house-wide implementation of antimicrobial impregnated gauze dressings led to a 24.1% reduction in SSI rates and cut MRSA infection rates by almost half, for a hospital cost savings of more than $500,000 over two years. \"Seasoned professionals (like Vyhlidal) need to share their knowledge with the new generation that is emerging,\" said Mueller.

The term \"hero\" aptly applies to APIC's December Hero of Infection Prevention, Pat Metcalf, whose efforts surrounding the discovery of a contaminated medical product led to a nationwide recall, potentially saving untold numbers of lives. Following the discovery of gram-negative bacteria within her hospital, Metcalf, RN, BSN, MA, CIC, director of Infection Control at Children's Medical Center of Dallas, T exas, zeroed in on a sublingual pH probe manufactured in Mexico. She and her staff of 4.5 full-time employees, (2.5 infection control specialists and one systems specialist), also participated in an outbreak investigation surrounding contaminated distilled water used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO). \"We organisms,\" Metcalf said while refl ecting on the 2004 product recall. \"It took a while to conduct the environmental culturing and interview staff, but we found the contaminated probe and reported it to the Food and Drug Administration, which then investigated the product and recalled it.\" It turned out that the probe was packed in contaminated saline, she said. \"Discovering this was great because we contributed to the safety of pediatric patients throughout the country, not just in our own institution. Working in a pediatric environment is vastly different than working in an adult institution,\" she said. \"Children are not just little adults. They are often more vulnerable t o infection, and the prevention strategies are not the same.\" Metcalf has worked in infection prevention and epidemiology since 1994, is active in her local APIC chapter, and has volunteered in various capacities on several of APIC's national committees and councils. Her passion for education led her to serve as an instructor in educational programs for her local chapter and for APIC. She specializes in improving quality and safety in pediatric care. Much of Metcalf's research has focused on the prevention of neurosurgical shunt infections in children. She has led efforts to collaborate with other pediatric facilities on surveys of infection rates and practices in both neurosurgical shunts and ECMO. Results from both surveys were presented at national APIC conferences. Her contributions to the eld of pediatric infection prevention and control, and her advocacy for pediatric patient safety, have made her a role model for her colleagues and for APIC chapter members.

Potentially deadly HAIs are on the rise, the associated costs are staggering, and something can - and must - be done about it. The subject is taking an interesting twist, as researchers and health practitioners are discovering that the solutions for other pressing problems facing the healthcare industry may also assist in the cause of infection prevention. In recent years, healthcare professionals have been in a quandary as they simultaneously faced several challenges: battling the advent of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, controlling skyrocketing operating costs, and - as if that weren't enough - guring out how hospitals could have a less toxic impact on the environment by \"going green.\" Many in the eld have seen these as competing agendas. Building environmentally friendly hospitals inevitably cuts long-term energy costs, but comes with a higher up-front price tag. HEPA ltration systems might reduce airborne infections in certain settings, but the power needed to run them is horrendously expensive. And many preventionists feel that green cleaning supplies, while planet- friendly and no more expensive than traditional disinfectants, may not effectively eliminate the microbial infectious agents that may survive on many patient care surfaces. A solution that would meet all three objectives has seemed elusive. But now, a growing number of organizations are recognizing that making a healthcare facility greener not only reduces its carbon footprint but lowers both operating costs and infection rates. Believing that creating the right patient care environment can reduce the spread of infection, architects across the country are using evidence- based design to create healthcare environments aimed at achieving all three goals. Key elements include: fewer shared patient rooms; nonporous, easily cleaned surfaces; properly designed air handling systems; negative pressure patient rooms and emergency departments; and a suf cient number of well-placed sinks and alcohol-based gel dispensers for washing hands. But that's just the beginning. According to a study by The Health Technology Center (HealthTech), money-saving technologies like motion-sensitive lights, doors and faucets can also cut down on infection, since germs on patients' and \"With hospital-acquired infections claiming more American lives each year than AIDS, breast cancer or automobile accidents, it seems the very facilities built to heal us have themselves become dangerous places,\" Lisa Zamosky wrote in the Los Angeles Times last July. \"Two million patients each year suffer from a hospital-acquired infection, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say, and nearly 100,000 of them die as a result.\" InfectionPreventionfe bynn Facing compelling - and, some say, confl icting - challenges, many major U.S. hospitals and healthcare architects are adopting a new approach: \"Green, clean and lean.\" BY CAROL LATTER 36 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistDESIGN PHOTO BY STEVEN SCHWARTZPrevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 37caregivers' hands are not spread from one user to the next. Wireless communications, which preclude the need for many people to handle a phone, and Radio Frequency Identi cation (RFID) tracking for tracing sources of infection, can also be part of a strategy to build infection prevention into a hospital. HealthTech, based in San Francisco, is a nonpro t research organization representing healthcare facilities and organizations across the country. Its members include Kaiser Permanente, California-based Sutter Health, and Boston's Partners HealthCare, founded by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. HealthTech Senior Advisor Barbara Harvath - a certi ed infection control specialist who ran the epidemiology programs for the Betty Ford Center and Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, and previously worked in clinical nursing for more than 20 years - said she's always been interested in how environmental sustainability and infection prevention could work hand-in- hand. Working at HealthTech gave her an opportunity to nd out. \"About two years ago, we developed a 'green, clean and lean' program, looking at the synergies between green and clean (infection control) and lean construction techniques, and at the improvements that were being made in getting all three things to work together,\" she said. \"Before, we had thought that infection control and [environmental sustainability] might not be synergistic, but that's not the case. We have found green and clean to be very synergistic. It's about wisely managing the resources that you have - air, water, touchless lights - all of those things have a [conservation] base to them, but have a huge infection control opportunity.\" In the past few years, hospitals across the nation have adopted this \"triple play\" approach, including many in California, and several major Boston hospitals (see related story, page 39.) The Center for Health Design, a California- based research and advocacy organization, is collaborating with more than four dozen hospitals nationwide to help them build safer and more ef cient facilities. Many more are following the Green Guide for Health Care - a voluntary, self-certifying system produced by Practice Greenhealth - to green their facilities. The United States Green Building Council, meanwhile, has just developed Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Healthcare, a system of standards that health- based facilities must meet to achieve ranked LEED status. The idea that properly designed buildings could reduce infections is not new. \"The Impact of the Environment on Infections in Healthcare Facilities\" - a July 2006 issue paper produced by The Center for Health Design through a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation - said studies show that at least one-third of HAIs are preventable. Although most preventable HAIs are device- related (for example, catheter-associated bloodstream infections), the paper goes on to say that \"a strong body of research shows that the built environment in particular infl uences the incidence of infection in hospitals, and that, by careful consideration of environmental transmission routes - air, surface and water - in the design and operation of healthcare facilities, hospital-acquired infections can be reduced dramatically.\" Harvath said when it comes to reducing airborne infections, the good news is that healthcare facilities have \"really taken huge steps forward in the way we manage air: heating it less, cooling it less, moving it less - but in the right way. All those kinds of things have a huge amount of impact on All patient rooms at the Shapiro Center at BWH are private and feature extensive natural light, a proven factor in accelerating patient recovery. The rooms are designed for the comfort of patients, their families and ease of movement for staff in their care of the patient.

BY CAROL LATTER A NUMBER OF big-ticket green hospital projects in Boston recently completed or currently under construction are just the latest examples of an international trend: the greening of healthcare. Massachusetts General Hospital's Building for the Third Century (B3C), scheduled to open in 2011, will offer a variety of sustainable design elements aimed at promoting healing and saving money while being kind to the planet. In keeping with research showing that access to nature and natural light promotes healing, the $579 million, 530,000-square-foot B3C will include 150 private patient rooms with fl oor-to-ceiling windows. The lack of shared patient rooms is one of several features that will assist in infection prevention, and improve patient comfort. Many of the rooms will have views of the Charles River or a sixth-fl oor atrium garden that will be home to 12-foot hanging plants, bamboo trees and groundcover vegetation. Green gardens will also cover the roofs of the facility, giving patients a welcome respite from a more tradi-tional hospital environment. Water for the garden will come from rain and water recycled from the building's cooling system. The rooftop garden will not only attract birds and but-terfl ies but will offer at least four times more insulation than a traditional roof. Naturally, any systems involving water need to be closely monitored to avoid infection control issues related to leakage or malfunction. Inside the building, recycled rubber fl ooring will be used to reduce noise, while bamboo walls will provide a connection to nature. Up to 60% of the building's energy will come from renewable sources. David Hanitchak, director of plan-ning and construction for the hospital, said green design features can aid in patient healing. They also \"provide a better environment for patients, fami-lies and staff by bringing light deep into a large building, improving indoor air quality and creating a non- or low-toxicity environment of care.\" Brigham and Women's Hospital's $382 million cardiac care center - the most recent of Boston's green hospitals to be built - has large windows to allow more natural light. All of its patient rooms are private, and each has its own bathroom. Paint, glue and other materials emitting harmful fumes were not used during construction of the 350,000-square-foot building, and rubber fl ooring was substituted for vinyl to avoid the need to strip wax with toxic solvents. The facility's ventilation system, meanwhile, was designed to reduce the buildup of allergens. High-ef ciency, low-energy systems were used throughout. It is expected to be the rst hospital in New England to obtain LEED certi cation. Other Boston area hospitals building environmentally friendly facilities include the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital Boston, and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, while Mount Auburn Hospital and Beverly Hospital are adding green features to new building additions. It's estimated that green construction adds 1% to 7% to building costs. On the fl ip side, green hospitals can use up to 30% less energy, and their patients are normally released sooner, with better outcomes. Massachusetts recently became the rst state to link environmentally friendly construction with healthcare expansion by proposing new guidelines stating that any healthcare facility looking to renovate or expand would have to meet with practical green building standards. The City of Boston, meanwhile, now requires new construction over 50,000 square feet to achieve LEED certi cation. infection control, but have been done largely because of green.\" Attention to design and maintenance of ventilation can optimize the air quality-improving conditions for patients and workers alike. Evidence-based design principles for h e a l t h c a r e h a v e a l s o i n t r o d u c e d \" s o m e newer technologies that allow us to isolate areas of a hospital rapidly and capably, so we can quickly deploy a solution for things like SARS, pandemic infl uenza or even potential airborne infectious agents.\" And what about other new technologies or products that claim to reduce infection - like copper surfaces? \"We've yet to see that it actually reduces infections. The question is, Can we actually trace it to reduced transmission of disease? Will it be bene cial or simply an added cost? Lots of companies tell us that they do it and do it well, and we've yet to see that actually pan out.\" Other technologies are potentially more helpful, like RFID tracking, she said. \"We can use that to track an instrument or some piece of equipment or staff, and see where they've been. Then we correlate that with infection control data, and see if we can identify some equipment or person that might be a hub of infection,\" Harvath explained. \"It's not about green but it is about our ability to really assess where potential dangers are coming from and then eliminate those dangers from our environment.\" Lobbies in sustainably designed hospitals generally feature plenty of windows and natural light, live plants, and easily cleanable surfaces. PHOTO COURTESY OF MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITALMassachusetts General Hospital's rooftop garden promotes patient healing. Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 39 When it comes to waterborne illnesses, \"some water sources have the ability to s u p p o rt gr o wth o f inf e cti o u s a g e n ts lik e Legionella, so nding it and eliminating it from your organization is very important,\" said Harvath. \"Another related problem for hospital environments is dampness, which can support growth of bacteria, fungi or mold - all of those things can really be prevented with a green strategy.\" She noted that green technology, offering greater control over moisture and water fl ow, \"are great in the green sense but also have a lot of bene ts in infection control.\" One of the most critical means of preventing HAIs, as preventionists are acutely aware, is timely, consistent and repeated hand washing. One of the problems with older-style hospitals and healthcare facilities was that sinks were often poorly placed, inaccessible, or too few in number. These days, said Harvath, sinks are much more plentiful, and \"almost every design puts the sink where the patient can see the healthcare professional, and the healthcare professional can see the patient. It is so clearly an important step in preventing infection that architects are putting it up front and center in the design. It is almost now a contract between the healthcare professionals and the patients that they are going to provide healthful care by washing their hands, and the position of that sink is critical in that contract.\" She added, \"It used to be that s inks weren't available in every patient room. New design demands that now.\" In addition, alcohol- based gel hand washing stations are now placed \"all over the hospital so staff can quickly and easily do hand hygiene without having to have a sink.\" In most of the new green hospitals recently built or under construction, there i s als o a tr e n d a w a y fr o m shar e d p a ti e n t rooms, in which it is more dif cult to reduce transmission of environmental contaminants from one patient to another. Evidence points to the fact that private rooms are one of the most, if not the most, critical design elements when it comes to preventing infection. Bronson Methodist Hospital in Michigan, which opened in late 2000, was one of the rst hospitals in the country to have only private patient rooms, and saw an 11% drop in infections compared to its old facility. The hospital's new room design features two sinks in each patient room - one for the patient and the other for healthcare workers - along with easily cleaned surfaces. Harvath said green building and the attendant affect on HAIs will become even more important now that there is so much emphasis on the cost of these infections - not to mention recent changes in regulations as to how these costs will be covered.\"Those HAIs are really going to resonate with hospitals now,\" she said, because the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services won't reimburse the full DRG (diagnosis- related group) payment for patients who acquire certain conditions or infections while in the hospital. She noted that studies done a couple of years ago showed the cost of an HAI in the case of a joint replacement was $100,000 to $150,000 per infection - a sum for which hospitals now might not be fully reimbursed. \"Transparency will make nding and eliminating the causes of infection really crucial for an organization's nancial stability.\" While many in healthcare originally thought that ef ciency was driving the sustainability movement, the green landscape has clearly changed. Green technology not only helps to save the planet but can potentially prevent and control infection, on a scale that s tands to save healthcare facilities billions of dollars. \"There's a dual-thrust bene t to this technology that makes it very valuable,\" said Harvath. Hospitals weighing the added up-front cost of touchless water faucets, for example, need to consider the advantage of potentially preventing even a single HAI. Touchless faucets with electronic mechanisms pose challenges related to potential water contamination, although newer designs are addressing some of these initial problems. However, it is ultimately worth the effort to nd both green and infection prevention solutions. Many hospitals are raising the bar on going green - including such things as atriums, floor-to-ceiling windows and rooftop healing gardens - in an effort to address not only patients' physical well being but their mental and emotional health while they're in the hospital. Interestingly, studies have shown that patients who have exposure to fresh air, nature and greenery heal faster and are generally released earlier, another cost-saving consideration. Rooftop gardens also have insulating properties, contributing to lower heating and cooling costs for the building below. Said Harvath, \"I think for a while, infection control and green thought they were at odds, but we're not. We're all, together, about creating a healing environment - and it takes both those components to do that, not just one.\" Two old buildings were torn down, and the materials recycled, to make way for a new greener building at Mass General, seen in its pre-construction stage, right.

BY RAED KHOURY, MA, MPH, MT (ASCP), CIC, ARM, CHSP, CPHQ, CHSAWith the start of the New Year comes the revamping of The Joint Commission's standards, offering a fresh look and a complete redesign of its Elements of Performance. \"Direct Impact Requirements\" The Joint Commission has recently de ned and identi ed \"Direct Impact Requirements\" as those which have a direct impact on patient safety and/or quality of care, and \"if non- compliance is likely to create an immediate risk\" to either the safety or care of a patient. The difference between \"Direct Impact Requirements\" and other requirements is that there are no or few processes or protective defenses intervening between non-compliance and the impact on the safety or quality of a patient's care. Speci c examples include \"pain,\" \"sedation\" and \"Indirect Impact Requirements\" The Joint Commission has identi ed those requirements that are not particularly \"direct,\" but are so-called \"on-the-fence requirements\" as having an \"indirect\" impact on patient safety and care. Although this term implies that the impact of these requirements is not as urgent or as immediate as of those of \"Direct Impact Raising the Standards Editor's Note: Over the past number of months, healthcare regulatory agencies have been reviewing and revising their performance standards in an effort to continually improve patient safety and prevent infections. In this, the rst of a two-part series on performance improvements and regulatory changes, Raed Khoury, director of Infection Control, Accreditation, Regulatory Compliance and Licensing for Kaiser Permanente F resno Medical Center, takes readers through The Joint Commission's revamped standards and Elements of Performance. The next issue of Prevention Strategist will publish an in-depth look at CMS' new regulations and the impact those regulatory changes are expected to have on the healthcare industr y.The commission has assessed these standards for redundancy, relevance and criticality, and is also placing greater emphasis on how they apply to patient safety. This move is a part of The Joint Commission's continuous improvement efforts, launched in 2006 as a result of its Standards Improvement Initiative (SII). Announcing that the scoring of standards will also be changed, The Joint Commission has provided a policy model with the following de nitions: \"Immediate Threat to Life\" In cases where The Joint Commission deems that a threat to life exists within a healthcare institution, the commission will issue a preliminary denial of accreditation against the facility, ordering that immediate measures be implemented to rectify any threats to human life. Two examples of these immediate threats are high infection rates and inoperable re alarms.Institutional accreditation would only be reinstated at a later date, once The Joint Commission has deemed that measures taken are satisfactory and that the conditions in question are no longer a threat to life. (This process nearly mirrors that of the California Department of Public Health, which has a procedure for dealing with situations involving \"Immediate Jeopardy\" to patients). If The Joint Commission issues a preliminary denial of accreditation against a healthcare facility - authority given to the commission by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - then that facility risks losing its Medicare reimbursement from CMS. \"Situational Decision Rules\" Under this policy, a healthcare facility could temporarily lose its accreditation if its operating license has expired, or if the facility has no license to operate. This includes individuals whose required licenses have expired. 42 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistRequirements,\" nevertheless, action must be taken to rectify issues surrounding these requirements. However, a healthcare facility generally has a longer time frame to correct what The Joint Commission sees as \"Indirect Impact Requirements\" than that required to meet \"Direct Impact Requirements.\" In addition to the above improvements in standards, The Joint Commission has made other changes involving the elimination of the \"B\" Elements of Performance (EPs), and has retained only the \"A\" and \"C\" elements. EPs are speci c performance expectations that must be in place for an organization to provide safe, high quality care, treatment and services. They are scored on a three-point scale: 0=insuf cient compliance, 1=partial compliance, 2=satisfactory compliance. Each standard has one or more EP; each i s labeled in the accreditation manuals, and each has the same weight. They are divided into three scoring categories: \"A\" Elements of Performance usually relate to structural requirements (for example, policies or plans) that either exist or do not exist, and are scored either 0 or 2. \"A\" EPs may also address an issue that must be fully compliant even though it focuses on performance or outcome, and may also be related to a Condition of Participation that must always be fully compliant. \"B\" Elements of Performance relate to the presence or absence of requirements and are usually answered yes or no. If the organization does not meet the requirements, the E P is scored 0. If the organization meets the requirements, but there is concern about the quality or comprehensiveness of the effort, the surveyor will review the applicable principles of good process design with the organization. If the applicable principles is met, the EP is scored 2. If none of the principles are met, the EP is scored 0. If more than one, but not all of the principles are met, the EP is scored 1. \"C\" Elements of Performance are frequency-based EPs and are scored based on the number of times an organization does not meet a particular EP. A \"C\" EP is scored 2 if there are one or fewer occurrences of non-compliance; it is scored 1 if there are two occurrences of non-compliance; and it is scored 0 if there are three or more occurrences of non-compliance. The new standards, which became effective January 1, 2009, impact not only hospitals but ambulatory care and home care as well. The Joint Commission has also added ve new chapters to its existing standards: 1. Life Safety: Emphasis continues to increase on issues related to life safety, which led to the separation of those standards from the chapter entitled Environment of Care. The Joint Commission has also added a permanent life safety surveyor to its team. 2. Emergency Management: More and more emphasis is being p laced on emergency preparation as lessons are learned from recent internal and external disasters. Standards surrounding emergency management have been separated from the Environment of Care Chapter. This is believed to be a long overdue and valuable move that will be welcomed The bottom line is that the standards have really been made clearer, more concise, and easier to execute. - Raed Khoury Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 43 by the majority of healthcare organizations. 3. Record of Care: These standards were previously listed as part of the Information Management Chapter. 4. Transplant Safety: Previously listed under the Provision of Care chapter, these standards deal primarily with tissues and organ donation. 5. Waived Testing: This new chapter, which deals with Point of Care Standards, was previously located in the chapter entitled Provision of Care. In addition, The Joint Commission has expanded the Infection Control chapter and its 47 pre-existing elements by extracting 12 and separately listing them in two or more clarifying categories, giving the healthcare industry 59 Elements of Performance for 2009. While there are no content changes t o the 2009 Infection Prevention (previously Control) Standards, (the implication being that this profession has a more organized approach and execution of The Joint Commission standards), there have been a number of formatting changes within the Infection Prevention chapters. Where once these chapters were numbered 1-9, the new format is now listed as follows: Planning A. Responsibility B. Resources C. Risks D. Goals E. Activities F. Infl ux Implementation A. Activities B. Medical Equipment, Devices, and Supplies C. Transmission of Infections D. Infl uenza Vaccinations Evaluation One particularly helpful addition to these chapters is the inclusion of a reference to related standards after each element of performance, making the material easier for infection preventionists to navigate as they prepare for all relevant requirements. The Joint Commission web site (www. jointcommission.org) also includes a crosswalk to the new standards - namely, a chart listing its 2008 standards and how they are revised in 2009. This valuable tool allows the infection preventionist to compare 2008's elements of performance with next year's. The Joint Commission is currently studying other areas for improvement, such as laboratories and behavioral healthcare, with plans to announce these changes in 2010. Overall, we shouldn't be surprised by the changes to the standards in the Infection Control chapter. While much of the content remains essentially the same as the 2008 version, some areas have seen a substantial redesign. These would require an in-depth review to be sure you have complied with the standards. The bottom line is that the standards have really been made clearer, more concise, and easier to execute.

October 2008. 44 | WINTER 2008 | infection prevention experts faced such weighty issues as \"What Could Change the World as We Know It?\" during its two-day annual Futures Summit, entitled \"APIC Vision 2012: Back to the Future,\" held in Orlando, Florida in September. As with the three annual summits preceding this year's meeting, the program presented infection prevention experts with the opportunity to envision the future of the profession - and to renew and re ne shared aspirations and strategic directions in order to develop a living strategy designed to improve patient outcomes. Moderated by Jerome E. Granato, M.D., a cardiologist and the medical director at Allegheny Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, this year's program covered a vast expanse of topics. In her opening remarks, APIC CEO Kathy Warye said the title \"Back to the Future\" was chosen \"because we're going to take a look at developments coming over the horizon: environmental conditions; things that are occurring out there in the broader healthcare environment that could impact infection prevention and control.\" As with past summits, information taken from this program would inform APIC's strategic planning as the association moves forward, Warye said. BY JAMES BATTAGLIOEmerging Threats, APIC's Futures Summit explores what lies ahead in infection prevention. 46 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistAPIC Board Member Cath Murphy, who also serves as chair of the Strategic Planning Committee, gave attendees what she called \"a global perspective\" on infection prevention, advising the audience that \"our crowded marketplace requires careful and proactive navigation.\" Using an airline fl ight path as an analogy, she encouraged the group to be \"nimble and agile\" in their strategic thinking as they traveled \"a fl ight path in APIC member,\" called infection prevention \"big news,\" and challenged participants to think of the IP marketplace, its opportunities and threats. \"How can this organization continue to reshape and remake itself in order to meet increasing demand over the next several years?\" he asked. \"The [Futures Summit] mission is to rely on the big picture and to use this as a pie-in-the-sky opportunity to dream big and think deep thoughts.\" Some of those deep thoughts included remarks made by Atty. David Marx, president of Outcome Engineering, Plano, TX, who presented on the topic of \"Patient Safety and Just Culture.\" He elaborated on six points: one half of the country will have statewide initiatives around Just Culture by the year 2012; systems and individual accountability will not be mutually exclusive concepts; \"no harm, no foul\" will die as a concept; the line will be drawn at recklessness; society will see substantial moves toward equity; and payers may be the last frontier. Marx described a future of full-scale partnership programs between state health departments, boards and hospitals, and added, \"we need a different system\" from that which currently exists. He quoted Harvard Professor Lucian Leape, who said that to punish people for making mistakes \"is the single greatest impediment to error prevention.\" \"Individual accountability will not be a mutually exclusive concept. It's not about either/or; not about the system's fault or the individual's fault. It's about nding middle ground to hold systems accountable for what they do, and individuals accountable,\" said Marx, adding that because a patient may not become infected, despite improper healthcare hygiene, the concept of \"No harm, no foul will be dying.\" Ray Pentecost III, AIA, president-elect of Academy of Architecture for Health, who addressed the topic of \"Designing Infection Prevention into the Environment,\" said that architects can make a difference in creating an environment \"where [disease] transmission doesn't happen. \"We can't just wave a wand and somehow make facilities better,\" he said. \"We've got intertwined cultures: administrative, clinical and facilities. The physical environment impacts nosocomial infections in all three modes of transmission.\" He introduced the term \"evidence-based design,\" which he said \"has almost developed a cult-like following,\" and abides by the theory that if evidence suggests a certain design impacts a certain outcome in the healthcare experience, \"then we ought to design according to that evidence.\" Noting that architecture is a profession often accused of having research that's \"a mile wide and an inch or two deep,\" Pentecost called his eld \"a frontier. ... To say we're there yet may overstate the case in a lot of areas.\" While saying, \"there's a lot more work to be done,\" he described such innovative systems as an automated voice that asks, \"Have you washed your hands?\" as healthcare workers leave a hospital room, but added, \"there were mixed results overall.\" Ella Franklin, RN, CRC, director of External Partnership Relations, Research, and Development for the ER One Institute at Washington Hospital Center, described \"The Emergency Room of the Future,\" in her presentation on ER One. She said the 10-year-old federally funded project is aimed at changing the current concept of emergency facilities to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. \"Unfortunately, we have had some real- life experience testing our processes and our capacity to admit large numbers of patients,\" said Franklin, referring to the critically injured Pentagon victims of 9/11. \"A month later, we treated over 2,000 anthrax exposures and fears, and we had a very robust response to the SARS threat.\" Franklin described the innovative and futuristic approaches the mass-casualty ER One has taken toward infection control, including antimicrobial fl oors, walls and high-touch surfaces in the nurse's station. Included within the summit were reaction panels during which participants provided points of view on how the preceding presentations could help APIC in its role. Denise Murphy, vice president of Safety and Quality at Barnes-Jewish Hospital at Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, and an APIC past-president, discussed issues such as mandatory infl uenza vaccines for healthcare workers, a culture of getting to zero in terms of healthcare-associated infections, and a culture of safety. Leah Binder, CEO of Leapfrog Group, a Washington, DC- based organization that advocates for improvement in quality and patient safety, said, \"employers are really interested in seeing the healthcare system start to use methods from other industries New Strategies \"How can this organization continue to reshape and remake itself in order to meet increasing demand over the next several years?\" Dr. Granato asked. \"The (Futures Summit) mission is to rely on the big picture and to use this as a pie-in-the-sky opportunity to dream big and think deep thoughts.\" Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 47 from diagnosis, the seeds of better health Amazed? for a safe, complete and efcient way to reduce blood culture contamination with all the necessary materials in a single, convenient package. to report species identication results directly from positive blood cultures within hours instead of days.

Ebi said that among the major impacts of global warming are worldwide malnutrition, diarrhea and malaria. \"As a public health professional who has been working in 20 developing countries, I can tell you that as temperatures go up, diarrhea- related diseases go up,\" she said. Sue Barnes, manager of the National Safety Program, Infection Prevention Control at Kaiser Permanente, discussed \"How the Green Movement Will Change Healthcare.\" She said while the efforts of infection preventionists and green sustainability proponents have been in parallel, they've not been \"synergistic.\" However, Barnes described a collaboration at Kaiser between the two groups and said, \"APIC can continue to lead that charge [by] continuing to build on the tremendous work that has already been done to help carve out the role of infection prevention and control in green sustainability.\" She said the greatest opportunity for infection prevention to contribute to green and sustainability efforts is to \"take a back-to-basics focus on environmental cleaning and disinfection in order t o reduce the amount of disinfectants required.\" Julius Landwirth, MD, JD, associate director of Yale University's Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, spoke on \"The Ethics of Infection Prevention and Control,\" touching upon issues such as mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers and universal screening for MRSA. \"The bioethics mantra, from a philosophical point of view, talks about three major principles: respect for persons' autonomy; respect for individual autonomy; respect for bene means 'Do no harm,' \" said Landwirth. \"Recognize that in order to do good for patients, for individuals, it's sometimes painful,\" he said. \"Sometimes there's harm, but the net balance ought to always be in favor of the bene t or thinking about what is it y ou're about to do and the question of justice. Be fair.\" On the subject of voluntary vaccination of healthcare workers, Landwirth said, \"it doesn't seem to be working very well.\" \"Keep your eye on the target, which is the reduction in morbidity and mortality\" of patients from infl uenza transmitted by healthcare workers, he said. \"Otherwise, it may not justify overriding individual choice.\" Summarizing the two-day summit, Dr. Granato described the group as having taken \"a journey from a 30,000-foot view\" that included a convergence of many forces, opinions, economics, payers and technical development. He said looking forward, APIC members would have new duties and responsibilities, and face new challenges brought on by a changing environment. APIC's S trategic Planning Committee will review the outcomes of the Futures Summit for possible implications with respect to APIC Vision 2012. (AHA=American Heart Association) Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 49 The past year brought a number of changes to the process of becoming certi ed, or recerti ed, in infection prevention and control -- along with some major shifts in our professional landscape. For example, the announcement by CMS that hospitals will no longer be reimbursed for certain hospital-acquired conditions, including three infections, has intensi ed the need to concentrate on prevention. Our practice is changing at warp speed, and we nd we must continually reassess and update our knowledge of what is included in our day-to-day activities related to infection prevention and control. Practice Analysis Due to the evolving nature of our work, the Certi cation Board of Infection Control and Epide- miology (CBIC) is considering soliciting your participation in a Practice Analysis during 2009. The importance of your participation cannot be overemphasized, since the ndings are used to develop certi cation examination questions. We will need to know the activities and knowledge required of you and your peers, so please watch for future information about the Practice Analysis. New Self-Achievement Test Available Soon The CBIC's Test Committee has worked to produce a new computerized Self-Achievement Re- cer ti cation Examination (SARE), which will be available this spring as an option for those who are recertifying. Since the SARE is a self-test, candidates must complete an attestation statement that the answers are solely the work of the individual completing the test. The computer-based test (CBT) will continue to be available at testing sites in the U.S. and internationally. Elimination of the Two-Year Practice Requirement CBIC members voted unanimously to eliminate the two-year practice requirement for taking the in itial certi cation examination. Job responsibilities and tasks must still include those required for the clinical practice of infection prevention and control. There are no changes related to recerti ca- tion examinations. Certi cation and You The American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN), the American Board of Nursing Special- ties (ABNS), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) actively promote certi cation of their members as a way to distinguish their dedication to continual improvement and a sense of professional accomplishment and credibility. According to these groups, some other reasons for becoming certi ed include: \"State licensure provides the legal authority practice nursing; certi cation ... refl ects achievement for specialty nursing practice.\" (ABNS) \"Better job prospects, higher salaries, the respect of your colleagues, the con dence from knowing you're fully quali ed to be a top-notch laboratory professional. Ultimately, the bene t is of course, the quality of care that patients receive.\" (ASCP) \"Certi cation can serve as a proxy for assessing continued competence, since a nationally rec- ognized standard to do so has not been developed.\" (AACN) The American Nurses Credentialing Center web site states: \"Certi cation validates specialty knowledge, experience and clinical judgment.\" The Canadian Nurses Association de nes certi- cation as the \"periodic process by which an organized professional body con rms that a nurse has demonstrated competence in a nursing specialty by having met the predetermined standards of that specialty.\" CBIC is sometimes asked why the examination is required every ve years rather than through Certifying for Success In our fast-changing profession, certi cation is more important than ever. BY DEANIE LANCASTER, RN, BSN, MC, CIC, CBIC PRESIDENTCBIC 50 | WINTER 2008 | Prevention strategistthe use of continuing education. Continuing education is not the same as competency; compe- tence is an ongoing process requiring repeated measurement. There are advances in treatment and technology we must be familiar with, and no oversight system exists to ensure continued growth in knowledge, skills and performance. Doctors Elaine Larson and William Rutala are internationally recognized for their published research on topics related to infection prevention and control. Dr. Larson also edits the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) and is the associate dean for research and professor of pharmaceutical and therapeutic research at Columbia University School of Nursing. Dr. Rutala is a professor of infec- tious diseases at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill and is director of hospital epidemiology f or the UNC Hospitals. Barbara Soule, APIC's president in 2003, is now the practice leader in infection prevention and control for Joint Commission Resources. She was also the rst editor-in-chief of the APIC Curriculum and serves on the AJIC editorial board. Louise Kuhny, MPH, MBA is senior associate director of standards interpretation at The Joint Commission. What do Larson, Rutala, Soule and Kuhny have in common? All of these well-known individuals are board certi ed in infection prevention and control. Why do they continue to maintain their certi cation when each could probably rest on past successes? They respect the certi cation process and value the knowledge mastery it represents to their colleagues. During the coming year, I encourage you to consider taking t he certi cation examination. You will be in good company. Prevention strategist | WINTER 2008 | 51 BD GeneOhm \u2014\u2014\u2014 (Product not for sale in the US.
