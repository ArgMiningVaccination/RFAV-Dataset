As a farmer-owned restaurant, almost all of our delicious food and drink - including [our proprietary spirits](http://www.farmersrestaurantgroup.com/about/beverages/) - is made from scratch using high-quality ingredients from American family farms. A beloved greater Philadelphia Go-To restaurant, we won Best Brunch from Philadelphia's Main Line Today magazine and are continually recognized for our sustainability efforts, earning a Green Restaurant Association certification and LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Founding Farmers King of Prussia honors our country's founding fathers and mothers who strategically grew crops, experimented with seeds, and researched new possibilities for food sources. These Founding Farmers knew that agriculture held the key to self-sufficiency and our country's independence. Our urban Pennsylvania farmhouse celebrates our nation's Founding Farmers, our family farmer-owners - the [North Dakota Farmers Union](http://www.ndfu.org/) - and many of our suppliers. In designing Founding Farmers KOP, we found inspiration in the beautiful surrounding countryside and the nearby, historically significant Valley Forge and the King of Prussia Inn. We commissioned a diverse group of artists to help us tell our story and some of the early history of Pennsylvania and our nation. Located in the center of the lively King of Prussia Town Center, Founding Farmers KOP is a full-service restaurant and bar open every day. Our First Bake Cafe & Creamery, located on the first floor, serves light fare, fresh baked breads, our delicious Farmers Donuts, our house-roasted Founding Farmers coffee, and our famous house-churned ice cream. On Saturdays & Sundays, you can now experience our full-service cafe & bakery for a la carte breakfast (8am-12pm) and lunch (12pm-4pm). 5% WELLNESS CHARGE: We believe hospitality begins with a healthy team and a stable, equitable work environment. To ensure both, a 5% surcharge is added to all dine-in checks that supports free mental health resources for our teams and their families, access to health insurance, paid sick leave, and increased operating costs. It is not a gratuity. Our goal is to be transparent while maintaining the value and standards our guests have come to know and love. We appreciate your support and kindness. If you would prefer, we will remove the charge upon request. To learn more specifics about this charge, please see [A Message to Our Guests](https://www.wearefoundingfarmers.com/a-message-to-our-guests/).
