There are others. If you're unsure, our digestive specialist Kurt Johnson can help. The Healthiest Approach to Nutrition We've found that the healthiest approach to nutrition doesn't involve taking supplements to correct a nutritional imbalance. Instead, we focus on making sure you eat right for your body type in order to get the vitamins and other nutrients your body needs. We use the Loomis approach to nutrition in order to give your body what it needs. Needs change with time and circumstances. The Loomis approach takes into account your age, medical conditions, environment, and even change in the hormones in your body. It's a caring, whole-body approach that focuses on giving each specific body what it needs. Detoxification Over time, toxins build up in our bodies and reduce our health. This can be due to many factors. One thing that many patients discover is that even though they haven't been eating unhealthily, they may not be eating right for their body. This, as well as environmental and other conditions, can cause the body to build up toxins that slow the body down. Some signs you may need to detox include: - Weight loss resistance - Acne or other skin conditions - Chemical sensitivity - Insomnia - Food cravings - Lack of energy, especially in the mornings, even after a good sleep - Fluid retention - Bad breath At the Chiropractic & Wellness Center, we provide a multitude of options--including massage therapy--to help you detox safely and effectively.
