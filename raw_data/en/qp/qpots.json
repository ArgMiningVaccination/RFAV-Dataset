Published by the Ibn Sina Institute of Tibb in July 2000, \"Tibb - Traditional Roots of Medicine in Modern Routes to Health\" provides in-depth understanding of the Tibb philosophy. It explains the link between an individual's temperament and illness, Tibb's diagnostic techniques and the restoration of health as well as the treatment of illnesses. International Journal of Recent Scientific Research 2019 ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT In the above research, one-thousand patients, aged between one and ninety-two years, and almost equally divided between the genders, were recruited. The study was five-months in duration and conducted at local Tibb Treatment Centres. The aim of the study was to evaluate the hypothesis that excess or abnormal states of the melancholic humour are a major and significant cause of many common chronic conditions. The physical age, gender and medical history, particularly of chronic disorders, and presenting signs and symptoms were recorded, and an assessment of the humoral imbalance present in the patient made by qualified and registered Unani-Tibb practitioners. The presenting disorder was allocated to one of acute, chronic, or combined acute and chronic categories. There was a steady increase in the incidence of patients with chronic conditions in patients with melancholic imbalance. In children and younger adults, it was virtually non-existent, and 15% in young adults. Thereafter it rose to 18% in mature adults, 56% in middle-aged adults, 71% in senior adults, 78% in older adults, and finally 100% in the aged patients. This clinical observation supports a basic principle of Tibb philosophy that physis, the body's natural capacity for self-healing gradually weakens during the ageing process and is less able to restore homeostasis to the body. International Journal of Recent Scientific Research 2017 Tibb is a holistic system of medicine based on the Temperamental and Humoral Theories of the founders of medicine Hippocrates, Galen and Ibn Sina. Medical literature indicates that humours exist at both physical and metaphysical level, therefore at both a cellular and sub-cellular level. Tibb philosophy hypothesises that each individual has their own unique humoral composition in relation to their specific temperamental combination. In order to maintain health, this unique humoral composition needs to be maintained and balanced by physis, the body's self-regulating/healing mechanism. Qualitative changes to the ideal humoral composition occurs from poor lifestyle resulting in imbalances occurring leading to signs and symptoms, affecting different systems of the body. Treatment is therefore aimed at restoring homeostasis, by eliminating excess or abnormal humours. This paper is based on research testing this hypothesis. The treatment approach focussed on restoring homeostasis using specifically designed herbal infusions targeting identified excess or abnormal humours. Where necessary other therapeutic interventions such as cupping, massage and additional herbal medication were employed. In addition, special emphasis was placed on the elimination of excess or abnormal humours via the colon and the kidneys. Patients with a number of common illnesses, both acute and chronic illnesses were evaluated. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 2016 Background: The concept of Mizaj (Temperament) is unique to Unani system of Medicine and the whole system is based on these fundamentals of Mizaj. The Hippocrates (460-370BC), father of Medicine was the first to propose the principles of Mizaj (temperament). The theory of Mizaj states that the individual temperament (Mizaj) of a person is fixed and cannot be changed. Just as a fingerprint cannot be changed, so our fundamental temperament (Mizaj) cannot be changed. Each individual may have their own likes, dislikes, interests and skills. These all characteristics make up the unique disposition or temperament (Mizaj). People of one type of mizaj (temperament) may be prone to a particular group of diseases in different phases of their life. Hippocrates rightly said, \"It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease, than to know what sort of disease a person has\". A person\"s temperament (Mizaj) has a direct influence on the state of health and inclination towards illnesses. Unani physicians have classified the mizaj (temperament) of an individual into four types namely Damvi (sanguine), Balghami (phlegmatic), Safravi (bilious) and Saudavi (melancholic). Thus, knowledge of temperament can help in planning a diet that is optimum for an individual and physical activities that promote a happy, healthy and productive lifestyle enabling people to live in harmony with self and world around them. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is a major source of short and long-term morbidity amongst the women in reproductive age group, perhaps also the most important avoidable cause of female tubal factor infertility. Objectives: This study tried to assess and establish the temperament (Mizaj) of patients of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. The consideration of this study had the potential to prevent and treat Pelvic Inflammatory Disease based on classical theory of Tibbia College, Karol Bagh, New Delhi-05. 60 subjects with confirmed clinical diagnosis of PID complying inclusion and exclusion criteria\"s were included in the study. Mizaj (temperament) of the subjects was assessed by a standard questionnaire of temperament. Literature Review: All the renowned classical Unani textbooks were searched for the term sign and symptoms and management were carefully studied and recorded. Modern medicine texts such as Dutta\"s Textbook of Gynecology, Shaw\"s Textbook of Gynaecology, etc were also searched for references. Beside this, related articles from authentic journals in PubMed and Google Scholar were also explored. Results: 60 subjects were enrolled for the study. The maximum number of subjects was found in 25-29 years age group. Highest number of subjects was of balghami mizaj (phlegmatic temperament) (n=30) by saudawi (melancholic temperament) (n=14). 10 patient of damvi (sanguine temperament) and 6 patients of safrawi (bilious temperament) were found. Conclusion: In light of this study, it can be concluded that patients with damvi (sanguine) and safravi (bilious) mizaj are prone to develop acute form of PID and with subsequent shift of acute inflammation towards mild and chronic grade; the mizaj (temperament) also shows predominance of balghami (phlegmatic) and saudaviyat (melancholic) constitution. So the temperament of a patient may be considered as an important factor in the pathogenesis of PID. KEYWORDS: Pelvic inflammatory disease, mizaj, temperament, damvi, balghami, safravi and saudavi mizaj. The perseverance of writing a review research paper, as a university student is no doubt not with the intention of getting good grades in exams but it's with the ecstasy & joy of discovering some thing no one knew before. And by reading this review research paper about the alternative treatment of the H. Pylori, this joy only those can grasp who obligate the pursue of wisdom. The greatest part of writing this paper was the time that I spent in reading published research papers in order to write some thing new on this topic. It is wisely been said that a man will turn over half a library in ordered to make one book. So my only requirement were also some recent authentic published papers about my topic. I gone through these steps: n First I downloaded 37 recent authentic published research papers n In first reading I just highlight the important findings & select 23 papers n In 2 nd reading I labeled all the highlighted parts with corresponding titles n In 3 rd reading I categories them so they create a whole new paradigm n Than I roughly make an outline for my review research paper n Than I wrote its first draught and printed it for proofreading n After editing and spelling check the final paper was ready to be print n In final reading I also give a second sight to the impotent research facts n I correlate all the important researches with their references n Than I also added a few pages of Philosophical explanation of H. Pylori n I tried to relate Tib-e-Nabvi remedies to heal the H. Pylori disorders n Some Spiritual tips about the preventive measures are also written n After printing the final paper I clipped it into file along with the... n Reference research papers that I have read in order to write this paper JETIR 2019 Islamic medicine & natural remedies in the light of modern medicine Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine (JISHIM) INERNAIONAL ADVISORY BOARD Dr. Alain OUWAIDE (Belgium)Dr. YAGAN (Syria) Dr. Keishi (France) Dr. Bacheer AL-KAEB (Syria) Dr. Plinio PRIORESCHI (USA) Hakim Syed Z.

Hippocrates (460-370BC), the father of Medicine and the pioneer of Unani system of Medicine was the first to put forward the ideology of Mizaj (temperament). The theory of Mizaj suggests that the every individual has a specific temperament (Mizaj) which is fixed and cannot be changed. Each individual may have their unique likes, dislikes, interests and skills. These all characteristics make up the elite disposition or temperament (Mizaj) of an individual. A person \" s temperament (Mizaj) has a direct influence on the state of health and inclination towards illnesses. Unani physicians have classified the mizaj (temperament) of an individual into four types namely Damvi (sanguine), Balghami (phlegmatic), Safravi (bilious) and Saudavi (melancholic). Thus, knowledge of temperament can help in planning a diet that is optimum for an individual, and physical activities that promote a happy, healthy and productive lifestyle enabling people to live in harmony with self and world around them. Oligozoospermia refers to semen with a low concentration of sperm and it is one of the leading causes of male factor infertility, perhaps also the most important treatable cause. Male sterility due to oligospermia can be defined as a failure to conceive following one year of marital life with uninterrupted coitus due to low sperm count and motility. The objective of the study was to assess and establish the temperament (Mizaj) of patients of Qillat-e-Huwain-e-Manvia (Oligozoospermia). The consideration of this study had the potential to prevent and treat Oligozoospermia based on classical theory of temperament (Mizaj). Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
