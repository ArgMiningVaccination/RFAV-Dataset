Call in your intention more quickly and boost your spiritual practice with herbs and botanicals. Check out more info from our expert [guest writer, Renee](https://awesomeon20.com/) here. When used with intention, manifesting is a powerful tool for creating the life you desire. You can work with herbs for manifestation to help you call in your intention more quickly. Herbs and botanicals can be an important addition to your spiritual practices. Once you've understood the basics of manifestation, you may start looking for ways to deepen your practice. Manifestation works on the mental and spiritual plane. Our thoughts send out a vibration, and that vibration is reflected back to us through the principle of correspondence. \"As within, so without.\" What we are thinking and feeling is manifested, or made real, in our physical reality. The principle of vibration teaches us that everything vibrates, including our thoughts and feelings. And of course, herbs and other plants have a vibration as well, and we can use these powerful herbs to align with the vibration of what we desire. It is, in essence, a practical application of energetic manifestation techniques. We combine the vibration of the plants with our positive thinking to focus our intention. This is similar to the way that many people will use [crystals to help them manifes](https://lorenrunion.com/57-how-to-use-crystals-even-if-youre-a-skeptic-with-karen-frazier/)t. The use of herbs brings the vibration of your thoughts and intentions into the physical realm, giving you something more tangible to work with as a reminder of your intention and your personal power. So as you work with each herb, whether as a whole plant, root, leaf, flower, seed, etc., you can visualize and hold a representation of your intention in your hand. And the cool thing about working with some herbs as opposed to crystals, is that you can actually take the energy of these plants right into your body. Table of contents Does using herbs for manifestation really work? Like all things spiritual, it works when you believe in it. Send out the energy of doubt and skepticism, and that's what you'll see reflected back to you. If you approach the use of manifestation herbs with the belief that it will attract your desires, that's what the Universe will show you. What you believe is what you get. Where to source your herbs Many of the more common herbs for manifestation can be sourced easily at your local market, and you may already have some in your kitchen. When using herbs for spells and rituals as opposed to making a salad, I like to remove a small amount, whatever I need for my ritual, into a separate container, and then energetically cleanse it, usually with smoke. That way these herbs are cleared of any energy they've picked up in the manufacturing process and are ready for ritual use. If you're good with plants or are a green witch, you may prefer to grow your own herbs. This can be very powerful as you can infuse the herbs with your intention during the whole growing process, and they will attract their good vibes to you at all times. Some magical herbs are quite rare, and their sourcing can be difficult. It may also be harmful to the environment or encourage cultural appropriation. Sacred herbs like sandalwood, palo santo, and white sage can be particularly tricky. If you feel deeply called to work with these plants, do your research and be sure you're getting them from a source that is sustainable and respects the culture of the plant's origin. It's also important to remember that some herbs you may see used for ritual purposes are not safe to ingest. Especially if you're looking at older sources for spells and rituals, some plants may be toxic, so do your research before ingesting anything you haven't safely eaten before. Herbs can also interact with medication, so speak to a doctor if you plan on ingesting medicinal herbs. Different forms of herbs In many spiritual practices, including witchcraft, which is what I practice, the word herb has become an umbrella term to include pretty much all plants and botanicals. So don't be afraid to include plants that wouldn't strictly be considered an herb by a botanist or even a chef. Roots, barks, tree resins, fruits, vegetables, flowers, really all types and all parts of plants can be incorporated for their metaphysical and magical properties. All these different things get lumped together as herbs by many magical practitioners. When you're working with herbs and plants for their metaphysical properties, you can access the energy of the plant in a variety of forms. Different parts of a plant might hold slightly different properties based on their appearance or purpose. For example, the fruit of a blackberry can call in fertility and abundance, while the thorny branches most commonly evoke protection. But for the most part, whether you're working with a potted plant, dried herbs, seeds, fresh leaves or flowers, resins, or essential oil, the metaphysical properties will be the same. This also allows for you to access the magic of herbs in a variety of different rituals and applications. You can use their energy in various modalities such as aromatherapy, feng shui, witchcraft, or whatever your manifestation practice reflects. What makes you feel good is what will get you better results. Bay Leaves for Manifestation The bay leaf is possibly the most common herb for manifestation. Ancient cultures like the Greeks and Romans crowned victors in laurel bay wreaths because it was a powerful symbol of success. The bay leaf's vibration can enhance wisdom as well. It's one of the best herbs for making wishes come true. They are tied to the third eye and solar plexus chakras, so their energy can also help you connect with your intuition and take inspired action with confidence.Other correspondences include the element of fire, Jupiter and the Sun, and the astrological sign of Leo. Any time you want to call in any of that energy or inspiration, use a bay leaf as a physical representation. The energy of this plant is bold, expansive, and daring. It's perfect for putting your biggest hopes and dreams out into the Universe and actually making them happen. Bay leaf manifestation ritual There are a number of ways that you can work with the bay leaf to enhance your manifestations, but probably the most common is pairing it with fire. This step-by-step guide will help you create a powerful bay leaf manifestation ritual that creates a true sense of magic. - For this ritual, you'll need a bay leaf, a pen (choose a color whose vibration aligns with your intention), a white candle, lighter or matches, and a fireproof container. - Start by writing your intention on your bay leaf. Then just sit with the bay leaf in your hand and visualize your intention. Really feel into what it will be like when your intention has manifested, and pour the energy of that emotion into the bay leaf. Visualize it absorbing that energy. - When you feel like your leaf is fully charged, use the candle to set the leaf on fire. It may crackle and pop a little bit as it burns. Watch the smoke rise from the burning leaf and visualize the energy of your intention being released to the Universe. Drop the leaf into the fireproof container so it doesn't burn your hand. - Once your ritual is complete, you can simply dispose of the ash, or add it to a jar, along with other materials that correspond with your intention. Keep this manifestation spell jar in a special place, such as your altar, as a reminder of the intention you set. Other Common Herbs for Manifestation In my practice, I like to focus on herbs that are easily accessible. I believe it's important to balance spirituality and practicality, otherwise, your ritual just becomes another chore. There are powerful mystical herbs like Balm of Gilead, Holy Basil, Tears of Chios, and Dittany of Crete that you could attempt to source from an herbalist if you feel deeply called to work with them. But there are plenty of more common herbs that you may encounter in your daily life that are just as powerful. Basil Basil is an excellent herb for calling in prosperity and abundance. Its verdant green leaves evoke a sense of richness and plenty. It can also be used to help you move forward when you are feeling unsure. Self-belief is crucial to manifesting, and this herb can help you stay focused on taking your next right step. Grow a basil plant and keep it near the entrance to your home to attract abundance or carry a pinch of fresh basil in a small bag to remind you of your purpose. Bathe in an infusion of basil to soak in its prosperity energy. Allspice Allspice is another beautiful plant for money drawing. It also brings good fortune and adds extra power and positive energy to any spell or ritual. Work with the ground spice or get some whole allspice berries. Add a dash to your coffee in the morning for a burst of positive energy or keep three dried berries in your pocket to remind you that you are always attracting good luck. Lavender Lavender is well known as a calming herb which can help you regulate your nervous system.It can also help you get yourself in vibrational alignment with your intention. Its calming properties can also be used in meditation, allowing you to tune in more deeply to your intuition and psychic powers so that you can take inspired action. This calming effect can also help you work toward deeper emotional healing. Rosemary is strongly tied to memory, wisdom, and mental clarity. It's also a powerful protection herb, and sometimes we need that energy to drown out any negative thoughts that may come from others or even ourselves. It's an important herb to have in your collection because, similar to clear quartz, it can be used as a substitute for any herb. You can always call on rosemary for whatever energy you require. How to use herbs for manifestation There are countless ways you can use herbs in your manifestation practice. You're really only limited by your imagination. Look up the common spiritual meanings of certain herbs, but also use your own intuition. Whatever the herb or plant means to you is how it will be most powerful in your practice. So for example, if you read that cinnamon is good for love and passion but you associate it with cozy home vibes, it's fine to use it to call in comfort and calm. Your intuition is the most powerful ingredient in any manifestation practice. Here are a few ideas of how you can use your manifestation herbs to draw in what you desire: - Create a dream pillow - Ritual Baths - Using herbs with the moon - Craft a tea blend - Create loose incense - Dress a manifestation candle Create a dream pillow A lovely little ritual for anyone who is crafty or likes to sew is to create a dream pillow. These can be created for anything you want to draw in including more money, a new job, or a new lover. Choose a piece of fabric that evokes your intention, and fill it with a variety of herbs, crystals, or other materials that correspond with your desires. As you add each item, be sure to give it a purpose to charge it with your intention. You could even add a bay leaf with your intention written on it. You'll then fold your fabric over the contents and sew it shut, sealing it on all sides. If you want to recite an affirmation with each stitch, this is known as knot magic, and it ties your intention to the dream pillow. Then sleep with the bundle of herbs under your pillow or mattress until your intention manifests. You can make your dream pillow as simple or elaborate as you like, so if you love embroidery, feel free to decorate it to your heart's content. You should feel good while you're making it though, so if you're not into needlework , it's fine to keep it simple. Ritual Baths A manifestation bath can be a powerful ritual as well as a luxurious bit of self-care. Water is a powerful healing force in its own right, and when paired with herbs, you can create a ritual for nearly any intention. We've all seen those gorgeous images on social media of beautiful claw-footed bathtubs elaborately strewn with flowers and crystals. Yes, you could absolutely do that if you want to, but it's a lot of work and a hell of a mess to clean up afterward. Cleaning wet plants out of my bathtub drain doesn't sound very high vibe to me. That doesn't mean you can't add the power of herbs to your bath time. You can use a reusable tea bag to capture your herbs. Hang it over the faucet so the water runs over it, infusing your bath as it fills. Another option is to make a tub tea. You brew your herbs in a teapot or even a saucepan, just like making a regular herbal tea infusion. Then strain out the herbs, and add the \"tea\" to your warm bath to allow you to soak in the vibrations of the plants. You can also work with an essential oil to bring the energy of a useful herb to your bath ritual. Be sure you've diluted the essential oils with other safe carrier oils, and maybe even some bath salts. Whichever method you prefer, remember, this is an energetic manifestation ritual, and not just a chance to shave your legs. You want to make it special and give yourself plenty of time. Set the scene with candles and crystals if that feels good to you. Play some high-vibe music to help you relax. As you soak in the energy of the herbs and water, use that time to visualize your manifestation appearing in your reality. Imagine the steam from the bath carrying the vibration of your thoughts out to the Universe. And the best part, just relax and daydream about your manifestation becoming your new reality. Then as the water drains away, imagine it carrying away any blocks and limitations. Using herbs with the moon You can also use your herbs to manifest with the moon. The moon has eight phases, so you can get very specific if you like. The new moon is ideal for new beginnings, while the first quarter is powerful for attraction. The full moon is a high-energy time focusing on success and abundance, and the last quarter is perfect for releasing what no longer serves you. The new moon begins the waxing phase, which is where you can perform rituals for growth and attraction. Use herbs like basil, mint, or cinnamon to draw your intention to you. The night of a full moon marks the transition to the waning half of the cycle. This is an ideal time for cleansing, releasing, and reflecting. Work with herbs like sage to cleanse away negative energy or cayenne to remove barriers from your path.

Craft a tea blend If you love to cook, you can use any edible kitchen herbs in a bit of kitchen witchcraft, adding ingredients with the intention to bring about your manifestation. In this way, you take the energy of the herbs directly into your body. If you're not much of a chef, you can still ingest an herb's power by crafting a manifestation tea blend. Choose herbs that correspond with your main goal such as drawing in money, developing a loving relationship, or reaching new heights in your career. Simply add them to a teapot and let them steep, then drink the tea and imagine it filling you with the energy you desire. To make it more of a ritual, be sure to give each herb a purpose as you add it to the pot. You can use the time that your herbs are steeping to meditate. If you add something sweet like sugar or honey to your tea, that will add extra attraction power to your ritual. Stir your tea clockwise to draw in good energy. Then drink it slowly, visualizing your desired outcome as you sip. Make sure all the herbs you're using are safe for consumption. Obviously, you want to choose herbs that are meant for eating or drinking, but also, things like dried lavender and rose petals can sometimes be full of pesticides if they're grown for purely decorative purposes. Make sure that your herbs are meant to be ingested before adding them to your teapot. Create loose incense You can also use dried herbs, resins, and other plant parts to create loose incense that you can burn during manifestation rituals. Some herbs, like mugwort, are helpful for astral projection or when working with tarot cards or oracle cards. They can help you make a deeper spiritual connection with your higher self or the Universe so that you can see your next right step more clearly. All you need to do is add a pinch of each of the herbs you want to use to a mortar and pestle, and grind them into a powder. Then light a charcoal disc in a fire-safe container, and sprinkle the ground herbs onto the disc. This will create a fragrant smoke to burn during meditation or other ritual work. You can also use the smoke to cleanse your ritual tools in future spellwork. If breathing in the scent of herbs sounds delightful but all that grinding and burning sounds a bit too messy, an essential oil diffuser will have similar effects. Dress a manifestation candle Candle magic is one of my favorite forms of spellwork. Simply burning your favorite candle is a fine way to start, but you can also incorporate herbs, both in their dried or powdered form, as well as essential oils in a manifestation candle ritual. Choose a candle color as well as herbs and oils that correspond to your intention. Blend your essential oils with a carrier oil to make them safe for you to touch if necessary. To prepare your dried herbs or spices, add them to a mortar and pestle to grind them all together into a powder. Before you begin to dress your candle, you can use a sharp object to carefully carve words or symbols into it to charge the candle with your intention. Then use your fingers to brush the oil onto your candle, being careful to avoid getting oil on the wick. Then you can sprinkle your herb blend onto your candle or roll it in the herbs. Then as your candle burns, you can meditate on your intention, visualize it, or recite affirmations. Whatever helps you get into vibrational alignment with your intention. If you only have a few minutes, a birthday candle is perfect. If you want your candle to burn in the background and continue to send out the energy of your manifestation, choose a candle that you can burn over several days. Using herbs is an easy and accessible way to explore various ritual forms of manifestation. Have fun with it and use your imagination. Remember, your aim is always to align your vibration with your intention, so bring that vibe to your practice and do what feels good to you.
