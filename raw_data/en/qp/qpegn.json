(h/t to [PrepperWebsite.com](https://www.prepperwebsite.com/make-a-natural-first-aid-kit-meet-healing-head-on-with-herbs/)) To make an herbal first aid kit, start by organizing your supplies and homemade herbal products. If you keep things in different parts of the house depending on their uses, reorganizing is important because it will make it easier to find things when you need them if they were stored together in one easy to access container. After you gather all your ingredients and supplies, look for a sturdy storage container. You can use an art-supply box, a sewing box or a tackle box, but a heavy-duty, three-tiered plastic toolbox is recommended. If you go camping or hiking often, you can prepare a smaller version of your herbal first aid kit with the most essential items. You can also include a mini-kit for your bug-out bag. Before SHTF, label all items clearly and include an instruction sheet on the proper use of each item so your family members know how to use them if you aren't with them.
