The employee was separated from employment, other than for cause, during a calendar year in which the employee did not have twelve (12) months of continuous service. The amount of pro rata vacation is determined by dividing the number of months of continuous service the full-time employee worked in the previous/current calendar year, whichever is applicable, by 12; the resulting figure is multiplied by the amount of paid vacation for which the employee is eligible in Section 7.1 above. Any fraction is rounded off to the nearest 17 356577.1 whole number of days. Employees separated from employment, other than for cause, will be paid on a supplemental payroll as soon as practicable following the last day worked. Part-time employees who work at least 80 hours per month earn vacation on a pro rata basis calculated in accordance with the formula used by the Employer in accordance with past practice. Section 7.3 All earned vacation leave shall be forfeited unless (1) the employee was denied vacation by the employer, or (2) the employee is on an approved leave of absence, or (3) the employee elects in writing to carryover up to three such vacation days for use individually or consecutively during the next vacation year, provided that notice of such election shall be given to the employer before December 15 of the vacation year.

Employees on duty disability shall retain any vacation leave earned prior to being placed on duty disability leave, together with all vacation time earned during the period of duty disability for the twelve (12) months following the date in which the person became disabled, and shall be entitled to use such vacation time within twelve (12) months following their return to work. 18 356577.1 Section 7.4 Employees who are terminated for cause are not entitled to any vacation pay not taken. Employees shall not earn vacation credit for any period during which they are on layoff or leave of absence without pay in excess of 30 days (except where such leave was adj udged eligible for duty disability) or engaged in conduct in violation of Article 12 of this Agreement. In the event of the death of an eligible employee, the surviving widow, widower or estate shall be entitled to any vacation pay to which the deceased employee was entitled. Section 7.S The rate of vacation pay shall be computed by multiplying the employee's straight time hourly rate of pay in effect for the employee's regular job at the time the vacation is being taken, times 8 hours per day, times the number of days' vacation to which the employee is entitled. Salaried employees shall receive their regular salary in effect at the time the scheduled vacation is taken. Section 7.6 Vacation picks will be granted by classification seniority, provided however, the Department Head shall have the right to determine the number and scheduling of crews and employees who can be on vacation at anyone time without hindering the operation of the Department. The Department will not designate any time or period during the calendar year when eligible employees would be prohibited from scheduling and taking vacation time. 19 356577.1 Employees shall make vacation picks at a time and in the manner currently provided for by their Department.

Any such cancellation of the vacation pick shall result in the payment of the vacation pay (thereby reducing the total of the employee's accrued vacation time) plus payment to the employee of the appropriate pay rate for all hours worked as if it were a normal work day, or for a normal work day, whichever is greater, unless the employee voluntarily agrees to reschedule the vacation days lost. Cancellation of approved vacation requests which would result in serious provable financial loss to an employee shall occur only in the most extreme emergencies. In the event of such cancellation, the Employer will reimburse the employee for reasonable losses incurred as a direct result of the cancellation, (e.g., cost of rescheduling airline tickets, deposit forfeitures, and the like) 20 356577.1 Section 7.7 Any employee of the City of Chicago hired prior to February 13, 1986 who has rendered service to the County of Cook, the Chicago Park District, the Chicago Housing Authority, the Forest Preserve District, the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago, the State of Illinois, the Chicago Board of Education, the City Colleges of Chicago, Community College District 508, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Public Building Commission of Chicago, the Chicago Urban Transportation District, and the Regional Transportation Authority, shall have the right to have the period of such service credited and counted for the purpose of computing the number of years of service as an employee of the City for vacations, provided that such service has been continuous service. However, vacation time accrued while working for another public agency is not transferable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, suspensions of 11 days or more may be appealed to arbitration in lieu of the Personnel or Police Board upon the written request of the Union. Disciplinary cases which are converted from a discharge to a suspension as a result of decision of the Personnel or Police Board do not thereafter become arbitrable as a result of said decision. The grievance procedure provisions herein and the Personnel or Police Board appeals procedure are mutually exclusive, and no relief shall be available under both. (b) An employee who is subject to disciplinary action for any impropriety or cause has the right to ask for and receive a Union representative to be present at any interrogations or hearings prior to being questioned. The interrogation shall take place at reasonable times and places and shall not commence until the Union representative arrives, provided that the 38 356577.1 Employer does not have to wait an unreasonable time and the Employer does not have to have the interrogation unduly delayed.

Such discipline shall be administered as soon as practical after the Employer has had a reasonable opportunity to fully investigate the matter and conduct a meeting with the Union and employee. The Employer is not obligated to meet with the employee and Union prior to taking disciplinary action where the employee is unavailable or in emergency situations. Demotions shall not be used as a part of discipline. Transfer shall not be part of an employee's discipline. In cases of oral warnings, the supervisor shall inform the employee that she/he is receiving an oral warning and the reasons therefore. For discipline other than oral warnings, the employee's immediate supervisor shall meet with the employee and notify him/her of the accusations against the employee and give the employee an opportunity to answer said accusations. Specifically, the supervisor shall tell the employee the names of witnesses, if any, and make available copies of pertinent documents the employee or Union is legally entitled to receive, to the extent then known and available. Employer's failure to satisfy this Section 11.1 shall not in and of itself result in a reversal of the Employer's disciplinary action or cause the Employer to pay back pay to the employee. 40 356577.1 In the event disciplinary action is taken, the employee and the Union shall be given, in writing, a statement of the reasons therefore. The employee shall initial a copy, noting receipt only, which shall be placed in the employee's file. The employee shall have the right to make a response in writing which shall become part of the employee's file.

A pattern shall be defined as at least two substantially similar offenses during said 18-month period. If an employee successfully appeals a disciplinary action, his/her file shall so record that fact. If the appeal fully exonerates the employee, the Employer shall not use said record of the discipline action against the employee, or in the case of promotions or transfers. In any disciplinary investigation of a non-egregious offense conducted by the investigative staff of the Office of Budget and Management, the Employer shall notify the employee who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation of the pendency of the investigation and the subject matter, within 30 days of the employer being made aware of the alleged rule violation. For the purposes of this Section, the term \"non- egregious offense\" shall not include indictable criminal offenses, gross insubordination, residency issues, or drug and alcohol violations. Thereafter, the employee shall be granted a pre-disciplinary hearing if requested within thirty (30) days. 41 356577.1 Any discipline given in violation of this notice provision shall be null and void. In the event that a discharged employee appeals an adverse decision of the Personnel or Police Board to the Circuit Court of Cook County, or thereafter to the Appellate Court of Illinois, and the decision of the Personnel or Police Board is reversed or remanded resulting in restoration of the job, the Employer will pay the employee's reasonable attorney's fees which he or she has incurred in connection with the court proceeding, excluding fees incurred before the Personnel or Police Board. The employee shall submit a post-appeal fee petition to the Employer, which shall be supported by full documentation of the work performed, the hours expended, and the rates paid by the employee. Should the parties be unable to agree on the proper amount of the fees to be paid to the employee, either party may refer the dispute to arbitration under the relevant provisions of this agreement. Section 11.2 Procedure For Department Review of Disciplinary Action Including Suspension Step 1. Within five (5 ) working days after an employee receives written notice of any proposed disciplinary action, including a suspension for ten (10) days or less which is not appealable to the Personnel or Police Board, or in the case of suspensions of 11 or more days which may be appealed to arbitration in lieu of the Police or Personnel Board upon the written request of the Union, the Employer shall conduct a meeting with the Union and % 42 356577.1 employee. Discipline shall be administered as soon as possible after the Employer has had a reasonable opportunity to further investigate the matter as appropriate. If disciplinary action is taken after the meeting or further investigation, the employee may request in writing to the department head for review of the said disciplinary action on a form provided by the Employer. Said request for review shall be in writing and submitted within three (3) working days of receipt of written notice of discipline. Said review form shall be printed on the back of or attached to the notice of discipline together with instructions for appeal. The failure to submit a written request for review of disciplinary action within three (3) working days of receipt of notice of disciplinary action will preclude the employee's right to review. Step 2. Within three (3) working days or any mutually agreed upon extension after the department head or designee receives the employee's request for review, the department head or designee shall conduct a meeting to review the suspension. Failure to conduct said meeting in three (3) days will result in automatic advancement to Step 3 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. At the meeting, the Department will give the basis for its action and the employee and Union representative, if any, will be heard and provided the opportunity to ask questions. The department head or designee shall render a written decision within two (2) working days of the meeting, except where 43 356577.1 both parties agree a further investigation is required. The absence of such agreement or failure to decide and communicate such decision will result in automatic advancement to Step 4\u00b7 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. A copy of such decision shall be sent to the employee and the Union. Step 3. Where further investigation is agreed upon, a second meeting shall be held between the department head or designee and the employee and the Union representative to discuss the results of the investigation. Said meeting shall be conducted within five (5) working days of the close of the Step 2 meeting, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The department head or designee shall render a written decision within two (2) working days of the second meeting. A copy of such decision shall be sent to the employee and the Union. If the parties fail to meet within five (5) working days or a written decision is not submitted within two (2) working days, the appeal shall automatically proceed to Step 4 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. Except where otherwise indicated, the time limits set forth herein are to encourage the prompt reviews of said disciplinary action and failure to comply with these time limits will not affect the validity of the said disciplinary action. This procedure shall be the employee's exclusive remedy for all said disciplinary action, including suspension for ten (10) days or less, or for suspensions of 11 days through 30 days which may be 44 356577.1 appealed to arbitration in lieu of the Personnel or Police Board upon the written request of the Union. Step 4. If the matter is not settled in Steps 2 or 3, the Union may submit the matter to arbitration under the terms of this Agreement.

There shall be no interruption of the operation of the Employer. It is agreed that the time limitations set forth herein are of the essence and that no action or matter not in compliance therewith shall be considered the subject of a grievance unless said time limitations are extended by written agreement of both parties to this Agreement. Failure of the Employer to answer a grievance within the time limits herein shall permit the Union to advance the case to the next step. The Union will be informed of and allowed to be in attendance at all grievance or disciplinary hearings. The Union shall send written notice to the Department Head notifying him/her of advancement to the next Step. Before a formal grievance is initiated, the employee may discuss the matter with his/her immediate supervisor.

The employee or the Union will indicate what Section and part of the Agreement is in violation, a brief description of the facts underlying the grievance, and the requested remedy, and submit the grievance to the employee's immediate supervisor. It is understood that if the employee has knowledge of the grievance more than twelve working days than the Union, the Union shall not thereafter file any grievance concerning that same issue with the Employer. B. Within five (5) working days of the written grievance, the immediate supervisor will notify the employee and the Union in writing of the decision. Step II A. If the grievance is not settled at Step I, the Union representative and/or the employee shall have the right to make an appeal in writing to the Department Head or the Department Head's designee within seven 46 356577.1 (7) working days after the date of receipt of the decision or the date it was due under Step I, by the immediate supervisor. The name of the Department Head's designee shall be posted for employees in areas where employee notices are normally posted and submitted to the Union. Failure to post and so notify the Union will permit immediate advancement to arbitration unless corrected within two (2) working days of notice of failure to post. B. The Department Head or the Department Head's designee shall meet with the Union's representative at least once each month to discuss all pending grievances that have been advanced to Step II. The purpose of the Step II meeting will be for the Department and the Union to share relevant information and discuss their respective positions with respect to each grievance pending at Step II, and attempt to amicably resolve as many grievances as possible. The Department Head or the Departmen t Head's designee shall have the requisite authority to resolve grievances during the Step II meeting. No grievances will be discussed at more than one Step II meeting, unless the City and the Union mutually agree that further meeting and discussion would be beneficial. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the City and the Union from their obligations to otherwise process 47 356577.1 and respond to grievances in accordance with this Article. C. The Department Head or the Department Head's designee will notify the employee and Union in writing with a copy to the Union of his/her decision within seven (7) working days of the completion of the Step II meeting. The response to the grievance shall state the Department's position with respect to the grievance together with a brief statement of the facts and reason(s) supporting that position. D. Any settlement at Step I or '11 shall be binding upon the Employer, Union and the aggrieved employee or employees. Grievances may be withdrawn without prejudice at any step of the grievance procedure if mutually agreed. E. If the grievance is not settled at the second step, the Union or the Employer may request final and binding arbitration by serving written notice on the other within ten (10) working days from receipt of the Employer's Step II decision or the date it was due. F. If the grievance or arbitration affects more than one employee, it may be presented by a single selected employee representative of the group or class. A class action shall be identified to the Employer at Step I or as soon as practicable. The resolution of a grievance filed on behalf of a group of employees 48 356577.1 shall be made applicable to all of the affected employees within that group. G. Even though a grievance has been filed, employees are obligated to follow instructions or orders of supervisors or the Employer, except where the instruction or order is so inherently dangerous to the employee that it could cause death or serious physical harm. The Employer agrees that by following instructions or orders the employee does not waive his/her right to process the grievance. Refusal to follow instructions or orders shall be cause for discipline. Step III -ARBITRATION If the matter is not settled in Step II the Union or the Employer, but not an individual employee or employees, may submi t the dispute to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate to the designated representative from the Employer's operating department, with copies of the request to the designated law department representative and counsel for the Coalition Unions, setting forth the facts and specific relief requested, within ten (10) working days after the answer is given or due at Step II hereof. Within five (5) days of serving the request for arbi tration, or as soon thereafter as the parties mutually may agree, the Union shall have the right to convene a meeting with the Employer's designated representative in an attempt to resolve the grievance prior to any further action being taken to 49 356577.1 advance the matter to arbitration. At such meeting, the Union shall set forth in writing the facts of the matter in dispute and the relief requested. The Employer will respond to the grievance in writing by giving the reasons which it contends support its position with respect to the grievance. In the event the parties are unable at such meeting to resolve the grievance, the Union and the Employer will proceed with the selection of an arbitrator as provided below. Either party may submit the grievance to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under the rules of that tribunal with a copy to the other party. The foregoing shall not prevent the Employer and Union from mutually agreeing to the selection of an arbitrator. The panel of arbitrators submitted must agree as a whole to commencement of a hearing within sixty (60) days of selection and that they will render a decision within thirty (30) days of the close of hearing. Any extension of those time limits must be by written consent of the Union and the Employer. The failure of either side to agree to an extension of time shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Arbitrators will advise the parties of their fees and expenses prior to selection and such fees and expenses shall be borne equally between the Union and the Employer. The arbitrator shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents at the request of either party. Each party shall be responsible for compensating 50 356577.1 its own representative and witnesses. The cost of a transcript shall be borne by the party requesting the reporter unless the parties agree to share such costs. An arbitrable matter must involve the meaning and application or interpretation of a specific provision of this Agreement or a document incorporated by reference thereto. The provisions of this Agreement and any other document incorporated by reference in this agreement shall be the sole source of any rights which either party may assert in arbitration. Questions of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no power to amend, add to, subtract from, or change the terms of this Agreement, and shall be authorized only to interpret the existing provisions of this Agreement and apply them to the specific facts of the grievance or dispute. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based wholly on the evidence and arguments presented to him by the parties in the presence of each other. No arbitration hearing shall be held unless both parties are present. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute, including the employee or employees involved. Where timeliness is in dispute, it shall be decided by the arbitrator. A. ADVANCED GRIEVANCE STEP FILING Certain issues which by nature are not capable of being settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure or which would become moot due to the length of time necessary to exhaust the grievance steps, or which the Union believes which 51 356577.1 would be resolved more expeditiously, may be filed at the option of the Union at Step II or Step III. B. PERTINENT WITNESSES AND INFORMATION The Union may request the production of specific documentation, books, papers or witnesses reasonably available from the Employer and substantially pertinent to the grievance under consideration. Such request shall not be unreasonably denied, and if granted shall be in conformance with applicable laws and rules issued pursuant thereto governing the dissemination of such materials. A Union representative,.a grievant, and Union steward will be permitted a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay during working hours to investigate and process grievances where this does not substantially interfere with the efficient operation of the Department, provided that representatives shall observe the Employer's reasonable visitation rules for Union representatives. The steward shall notify his/her immediate supervisor for permission to handle grievances on work time, it being understood that the operation of the Department takes precedence unless there is an emergency, but such permission shall not be denied unreasonably. A reasonable number of employees may attend the meeting without loss of pay; such meetings shall be set by mutual agreement by the Employer and the Union. Where the Employer directs an employee to report for a meeting concerning a grievance at a time when the employee is not scheduled to work such time shall be considered time worked. 52 356577.1 If there is space available, the Employer, upon request of the Union representative, shall provide the use of a room and telephone, to discuss the grievance, subject to the Employer's reasonable rules for the Union's use of such facilities. C. EXPEDITED ARBITRATION The Employer and the Union may mutually agree to submit any grievance to expedited arbitration. Pursuant to expedited arbitration, the parties shall mutually select an arbitrator from a group of arbitrators approved by the parties. The expedited arbitration hearing shall be scheduled as early as possible from the date the parties agreed to submit the grievance to expedited arbitration. The parties agree to waive the stenographic recording of the hearing and the filing of post-hearing briefs. Pursuant to the parties' agreement, the arbitrator shall issue either an oral decision at the close of the hearing or a written decision within twenty (20) days of the date of the hearing. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute. D. MANAGEMENT OF ARBITRATION DOCKET A representative from the Employer's law department and counsel for the Coalition Unions shall meet at least quarterly, or more frequently as necessary, in order to discuss the scheduling of specific cases for available hearing dates. At these meetings, the parties shall designate at least one pre\u00ad established hearing date per month for the arbitration of grievances. 53 356577.1 Section 11.4 Conduct of Disciplinary Investigations Supplementing all rights and processes due employees covered by this Agreement who may be the subject of a disciplinary investigation by the Inspector General, the interview will be conducted in the following manner: A.

G. An employee under investigation will be provided without unreasonable delay with a copy of any written statement the employee has made. H. (1) If the allegation under investigation indicates a recommendation for discipline is probable against the employee, said employee will be given the statutory administrative proceedings rights prior to the commencement of the interview. (2) If the allegation indicates that criminal prosecution may be probable against said employee, the provisions of this Section shall be inapplicable and said employee will be afforded his constitutional rights concerning self\u00ad incrimination prior to the commencement of the interview. An employee will not be read his/her administrative and Miranda rights during the same interview. I. At the request of the employee under investigation, an employee who may be subject to discipline shall have the right to be represented in the interview by a representati ve of the Union. The employee shall be 55 356577.1 f. told that he/she has the right to Union representation \\ before commencement of the interview.

The Employer shall not compel an employee under investigation to speak or testify before, or to be questioned by, any nongovernmental agency relating to any matter or issue under investigation. K. The results of a polygraph examination shall not be used against an employee in any forum adverse to the employee's interests.

If an employee is asked to take a polygraph examination, he/she will be advised in writing 24 hours prior to the administration of the examination. The results of any polygraph examination shall be known to the employee within one week. L. This Section shall not apply to employee witnesses. M. The identity of an employee under investigation shall not be made available to the media during the course of an investigation until charges are filed by the Employer and the employee has the opportunity to respond thereto. If an employee is exonerated after the City initially informed the media of the charges 56 356577.1 against the employee, the City will make that fact available to the media where the employee requests it. N. In the event that disciplinary action is taken against an employee, any allegations of violations of this Section shall be heard in connection with, and in the same forum as, grievances which protest said disciplinary action, except as provided in paragraph 0(2) below. If no disciplinary action is brought against the employee following the conclusion of the Inspector General's investigation, no grievance concerning the conduct of the investigation shall exist. o. (1) Any evidence or information including employee statements that is obtained in violation of the rights enumerated in this Section, shall be suppressed and shall not be used by the Employer for any disciplinary action against the employee, or in the case of promotions or transfers. (2) (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph N above, at the option of the Union, a claim that the Inspector General has violated the provisions of this Section may be raised in a suppression hearing before a member of the permanent hearing panel listed herein, rather than in the disciplinary hearing as required in paragraph N above. (2) (b) (1) The Union may exercise this option by notifying the employee's Department Head and the 57 356577.1 Employer r S Law Department in writing not later than ten (10) calendar days before an arbitration or the Personnel or Police Board hearing, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Agreement. The appeal shall specify the particular contract provisions allegedly violated, together with a factual summary of the conduct alleged to have violated the Agreement. It is understood that by exercising this option, any and all time limits set forth in Chapter 2-74-060 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago regarding the Personnel Board hearing shall be tolled until the arbitrator renders a decision as provided below.

To select the initial panel, or should any member of the panel resign or be removed upon mutual agreement of the parties during the life of this Agreement, the parties will meet to reach agreement on new panel member who must be an arbitrator listed with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. If no agreement can be reached, the Employer will request a panel of seven (7) arbitrators from FMCS, all of whom must be members of 58 356577.1 the National Academy of Arbitrators. Thereafter, the parties will meet to strike names from the list, with the Employer striking first, until one name remains, which person shall be named to the panel. 2 (c) The suppression hearing shall be convened within thirty (30) calendar days of the selection of the panel member, or at such other time as the parties may mutually agree. The arbitrator s jurisdiction shall I be limited to determining if the Inspector General obtained evidence or statements in violation of paragraph 0 (1) above, and if such evidence should be suppressed. The arbitrator shall have no authority to rule on the merits of any underlying discipline or take any other action beyond that specifically set forth in this subparagraph. 2 (d) The panel member shall render an expedited decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties. It shall not be subj ect to collateral attack in any further disciplinary proceeding involving the employee in question. P.

The Employer shall provide to the Union within thirty (30) days name, address, classification, rate of salary and starting date of any new employee hired into the Union's bargaining unit. Section 13.2 It is further agreed that 30 days after the later of the execution of the Agreement or the employee's date of hire, the Employer shall deduct from the earnings of employees who are not members of the Union, a monthly amount as certified by the Union and shall remit such deductions to the Union at the same time that the dues checkoff is remitted. It is understood that the amount of deductions from said nonmember bargaining unit employees will not exceed the regular monthly union dues and represents the employee's fair share cost of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.

I f the Employer makes any substantial change in job duties it will discuss such changes with the Union prior thereto. If the Employer changes a job title without substantially changing the duties of the job, the Union will retain its existing jurisdiction over the new job title. The Employer will not permanently assign bargaining unit work to the jurisdiction of another bargaining unit without the mutual agreement of the unions involved. 63 356577.1 Section 14.2 Traditional Work Any work which has been traditionally performed by employees who are represented by the Union shall continue to be performed by said employees, except where non-unit employees have in the past performed unit work, or in emergencies, to train or instruct employees, to do layout, demonstration, experimental, or testing duties, to do troubleshooting or where special knowledge is required, provided however, where employees do not report to work because of vacations, or other absences or tardiness, or for personal reasons during the course of the day, or because all of the employees are or will be occupied with assigned duties, or to complete a rush assignment, employees of any other unit represented by another Union shall not perform the work of said employees. For example, if a Roofer is on vacation, a Plumber shall not be assigned as a replacement Roofer. The Employer shall not arbitrarily extend the period of any emergency beyond the need for that emergency.

Nothing herein shall deprive members of the bargaining unit of the right to perform historical and traditional unit work; nor shall the City lay-off a bargaining unit employee for the purpose of replacing that person with a member of management. 64 356577.1 Section 14.3 Jurisdictional Disputes In the event that the Union files a grievance claiming that the Employer has violated the terms of this Agreement by assigning certain work to City employees represented by another union, or where the Employer receives a grievance from another union protesting the assignment of work to employees covered under this Agreement, the Employer shall serve written notice to the Union, and on the other affected union(s), of the existence of said dispute. This notice shall describe the nature of the work in dispute. In the event this dispute remains unresolved and is submitted to arbitration, the provisions of Article 11 herein regarding arbitration of grievances shall apply, except that in addition to the Employer and the Union, the other affected union(s) shall have the opportunity to participate in the hearing and to present evidence, but shall not be bound to the results of that arbitration unless all parties so agree in advance of the hearing. If the Union shall prevail in said arbitration and is awarded the work in dispute, and if, in that event, the other affected union(s) shall pursue a claim against the Employer that the reassignment of the work in dispute violates the Agreement of that other union, the provisions of this Section shall apply to that claim as well. All parties to the dispute shall have the right to participate in any arbitration hearing of that claim and to present evidence therein. Should the arbitrator in the second proceeding determine that the Employer's reassignment 65 356577.1 of the work in dispute violates the other union (s)' Agreement, thereby requiring the Employer to comply with two conflicting arbitration decisions as to which of the unions is entitled to perform the disputed work, the following provisions shall apply. The Employer shall have the right to invoke arbitration of the dispute under the provisions of the grievance and arbitration procedures contained in Article 11 of this Agreement, except that the Union and the other affected union(s) shall select the arbitrator. The Employer, the Union and the other affected union(s) shall be parties to that proceeding, and shall have the right to fully participate in the hearing. During the pendency of this proceeding, the work assignment directed by the first arbitrator shall be followed by the parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to decide only which of the two conflicting awards shall prevail. The arbitrator's decision shall be based solely upon the prior arbitration awards, the record before both prior arbitrators, and the traditional work and other relevant provisions of this Agreement and of the collective bargaining agreement of the affected union (s) . No other evidence or testimony shall be admitted in that hearing. The decision of the arbitrator in this proceeding shall be final and binding upon all parties to the dispute, and none of the parties to the dispute shall seek review of that award in any other judicial or administrative forum. Nothing herein shall preclude all parties to the dispute from voluntarily resolving it at any time. 66 356577.1 Section 14.4 Deferred Compensation The Employer's policy which is in effect at the execution of this Agreement, pertaining to deferred compensation, shall be afforded to all employees of the Employer without change during the term of this Agreement. Section 14.5 Rules of Conduct Changes When the Employer proposes to initiate reasonable changes or additions to its rules of conduct, which could subject Employees to discipline, the Employer shall transmit four (4) copies of the proposed changes or additions to the Union. The Union will consider the proposals, and upon request, the Employer will meet with the Union within twenty (20) calendar .days of the receipt of the proposals to receive the Union's comments. Absent an emergency, the Employer will not implement its proposed changes or additions until the Union has had a reasonable opportunity to present its views and discuss the proposals with the Employer. No such changes or additions shall be implemented without prior pUblication and notice to the affected Employees. Section 14.6 Safety (a) The Employer shall provide a safe and healthful working environment for employees covered by this agreement including in accordance with applicable federal and state occupational safety and health laws, and shall maintain in good and safe working condition all equipment necessary for the safe and proper performance of the job. 67 356577 .1 (b) In furtherance of those efforts, a j oint safety commi ttee shall be established which shall be composed of six (6 ) representatives of the Union Coalition and six ( 6) representatives of the Employer. The purpose of the committee shall be to discuss and to make recommendations concerning occupational safety and health issues affecting employees. All recommendations of the committee with respect to safety and health issues shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate Department Head with a copy to the Union and the Director of Labor Relations. The Department Head shall promptly issue a written response to the committee concerning the Department's views regarding the committee's recommendations. The parties may decide, from time to time, to refer certain safety issues and concerns to the personnel of the affected Department(s) responsible for safety matters and Union representatives of the affected employee (s) . The Department safety personnel will meet and confer with a representative of the affected Union about such issues and report back to the Committee on any decisions or recommendations concerning them. (c) The joint safety committee shall meet at least once a month, or otherwise by mutual agreement. (d) The parties agree and understand that if an employee is faced with an unsafe working condition, the employee is required to perform the task in question unless the employee's performance of an assigned task presented the strong likelihood of subjecting the employee to imminent danger of death or serious injury. If the employee, with no reasonable 68 356577.1 alternative, refuses in good faith to perform that task and expose himself to that dangerous condition, he will not be subj ect to discipline. In order to avoid discipline under this paragraph, the condition must be of such a nature that a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would conclude that there is a real, substantial, and imminent danger of death or serious injury. In addition, the employee must also have sought from the Employer, and have been unable to obtain, correction of the situation before refusing to perform the task in question. Section 14.7 Information to Union The Employer will provide to the Union on a monthly basis a bargaining unit report of current active employees, the list to include employee name, address, social security number, title, pay schedule, grade, current pay rate, status, continuous service date, time in title, date of birth, race and sex.

Notice of any such contracting or subcontracting shall be given to the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to its effective date. The notice shall be in writing and shall contain the name and address of the party who will perform the work, a description of the work to be performed and any other relevant data to enable the Union to determine compliance with this Section. In the event such party is determined not to be in compliance with the said area standards, the Employer shall withhold payouts and shall not contract or subcontract further with any such party until the Union and the Employer receive a written and enforceable assurance of compliance. In the event that the Employer determines to subcontract unit work under this Agreement, and as a result bargaining unit employees would be laid off by the proposed subcontracting, the Employer shall make available, on a seniority basis, equal-rated permanent jobs which the Employer has declared to be vacant in the affected Department, or other departments, as the case may be, in that order, provided the laid off employees have the then present ability to perform the required work without further training. However, the employee shall be provided with a 70 356577.1 reasonable amount of orientation to allow him or her to perform the work. Prior to sub-contracting of bargaining unit work, the Employer, the Union, and the proposed sub-contractor shall meet to discuss the employment of employees subject to layoff. During that meeting the Employer will request and urge that the sub\u00ad contractor hire laid off employees. Section 14.9 Automobile Reimbursement Employees who are required by the Employer to use their own automobiles in the performance of their job shall receive mileage reimbursement at the then effective rate recognized by the Internal Revenue Service, with a maximum of $250 per month.

S . City Average for the previous year, as rounded to the nearest $5 increment. Employees seeking mileage reimbursement must submit that request on a form provided by the Employer. Payment for mileage expenses will be made on a monthly basis. In the event that during the life of this Agreement the Employer shall implement for any group of employees an automobile expense 71 356577 .1 reimbursement program which is more favorable to employees than the provisions of this paragraph, upon notice from the Union, the Employer will meet and discuss with representatives of the Union the possible application of said new program to employees covered by this Agreement. Upon request by either party made no earlier than January 1, 2010, the parties shall meet to discuss any proposed changes to this Section 14.9. ARTICLE 15 LAYOFFS AND RECALL Section 15.1 Probationary employees with more than 90 days of service shall be laid off first. Thereafter, the least senior employee . in the affected job classification shall be laid off first provided the ability, qualifications to perform the required work, and the employee's job performance are equal among the other employees in the job. \" Seniority\" shall mean, for purposes of this Section, the employee's continuous service in any bargaining unit title (s) Citywide. A laid-off employee may displace (bump) the least senior employee, if any, in the most recent lower job title the employee to be laid off has held, provided the employee to be laid off has the then present ability to perform the job to the Employer's satisfaction without further training. Employees shall be recalled in the reverse order they were laid off. 72 356577.1 ARTICLE 16 SEPARABILITY Section 16.1 In the event any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid or unenforceable by reason of any Federal or State Law or Local Ordinance now existing or hereinafter enacted, such invalidity or unenforceabili ty shall not affect the remainder of the provisions hereof. The parties agree to meet and adopt revised provisions which would be in conformity with the law.

Stewards will be permitted to handle and process grievances referred by employees at the appropriate steps of the grievance procedure during normal hours, without the loss of pay, provided that such activity shall not exceed a reasonable period of time, or unreasonably interrupt the work of employees. Stewards shall notify their immediate supervisors in advance of their intention to handle and process grievances. Supervisors may not unreasonably withhold permission to the stewards to engage in such activities. Employees acting as Union Stewards shall not be discriminated against nor be transferred from their job classifications or departments because of their activities on 73 356577.1 behalf of the Union. Any transters of Union Stewards from their job classifications or departments, other than in an emergency, will be discussed with the Union in advance of any such transfers.

Furthermore, the economic cost of providing health care services to employees who abuse drugs and alcohol has put an increasing burden on the City's finance. The Employer and the Union maintain a strong commitment to protect people and property, and to provide a safe working environment. To this end, the employer has also established its confidential Employee Assistance Program for employees with personal problems, including alcohol and substance abuse, and the parties to this Agreement urge employees who have such problems to utilize the Program's services. To maintain a workplace which provides a safe and health work environment for all employees, the following drug and alcohol program is also established. Section 18.2 Definitions (a) Alcohol: Ethyl alcohol (b) Prohibited Items & Substance: all illegal drugs and controlled substances, alcoholic beverages, and drug paraphernalia in the possession of, or being used by, an employee on the job or the premises of the Employer. (c) Employer Premises: all property, facilities, land, buildings, structures, automobiles, trucks and other vehicles 75 356577.1 owned, leased or used by the Employer as job sites or work locations and over which the Employer has authority as employer. (d) Employee: all persons covered by this Agreement.
