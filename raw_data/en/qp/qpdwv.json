It is an intelligent system that can, under healthy conditions, distinguish between self and non-self. It is extremely crucial to maintain a healthy immune system by maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise combined with some herbal immune support. There is a growing amount of research interest in exploring the importance of nutrition on the effective functioning of the immune system. A poor diet, chronic stress, lack of sleep, excess weight can all impact the production and activity of immune cells and antibodies to varying degrees. Immunity can also be affected by frequently eating highly processed foods, foods that are rich in refined sugar, and low in fruits and vegetables. While a wholesome diet plays a vital role in building up the immunity, certain Ayurvedic herbs for immune system can further boost immune function. Ayurvedic texts mention several health benefits of Giloy (Tinospora cordifolia), including its ability to boost immunity. Ayurveda considers giloy to be a 'Rasayana', meaning an herb that can strengthen the body by nourishing the Rasa dhatu. Rasa refers to the essence of a substance while dhatu refers to tissue. From a physical aspect of the body, Rasa dhatu refers to all the fluids including the plasma, lymph, and interstitial fluids. Rasayanas support the body's natural defense system and they also help maintain optimum health by nourishing and fortifying other tissues. In general, Ayurvedic herbs for immune system would possess the qualities of a Rasayana. However, Rasayana might not be limited to herbal immune support, but it would also involve incorporating lifestyle changes that bring more balance and harmony to the mind and body. "}
