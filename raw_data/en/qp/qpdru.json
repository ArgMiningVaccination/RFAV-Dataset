Breathtaking! Remarkable! Mere words can not describe the emotions felt when pondering the accomplishments attained by our dedicated, professional staff in 2013. At the overall hospital level, patient satisfaction remains above the 90th percentile, physician satisfaction was at the 95th percentile, Leap Frog \"A\" score for patient safety, lower (lowest in BHSF) cost per case mix adjusted admission, ... I could go on and on. Our nursing units, through shared governance, has many, many commendable, innovative accomplishments. BSN rate increased from 41 to 45%, NDNQI nurse survey had a 97% (!) participation rate, with high job enjoyment at the highly satisfied level. The Unit Practice Councils have done tremendous work on improving and enhancing the processes on the various nursing units. The amount and breadth of work being performed is impressive and overwhelming. It seems like the pace of change continues on a highly sloped trajectory. In a few short months we will implement a significant upgrade to the hospital information system, from Invision/NetAccess to Soarian. At the same time, we will continue working on patient flow to relieve the Emergency Department, to include piloting an admission/discharge unit on MS3. Thank you for your continued devotion to both Homestead Hospital and Baptist Health South Florida, but also to our patients and visitors. You guys make miracles happen every day. I continue to be in awe and thankful. Thoughts from Your CNO Gail Gordon, R.N. Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Last year, 2013 was year four of our Journey to Magnet designation. Our Shared Governance Model is solidly in place, with hospital -wide councils and Unit Practice Councils working on our goals. There have been many activities related to our strategic goals such as increasing nurse certification, more BSN prepared nurses, increasing activity in the community and preventing falls. Patient, physician and nurse satisfaction were strong. Our quality and financial measures were all high. As we look ahead to submitting our document for review, we prepared ourselves for the writing phase of the journey. A consultant spent a day with us teaching us writing skills and templates to use when writing about the 49 Sources of Evidence (SOE). We began to identify stories that would demonstrate excellence for each standard. This is definitely a team effort. This is the year we will write, rewrite and write again until we are satisfied it is ready to submit. We will be submitting electronically, which is a fairly new process. We set the date to submit the application as February 2015. If accepted, the ANCC site visit will be scheduled to validate the facts on the application. A positive ANCC visit is the last step in the process. Then we celebrate! We have come so very far in these four years, but there is more to do. I have no doubt that we will get there with everyone's focus and participation. We do great things at Homestead Hospital every day. We just need the world to know. Thanks for all you do make a difference. I am proud to work with you. Letter from Your CEO Bill Duquette Chief Executive Officer 3 The New 2014 Magnet Application Manual The American Credentialing Center (ANCC) released the 2014 Magnet application manual in July 2013. Organizations that are applying for initial designation or re -designation will be required to use it effective August 1, 2014. Magnet designation remains the most prestigious international distinction that a healthcare organization can receive for excellence in nursing care and quality patient outcomes. The new manual provides the roadmap for organizations embarking on the Magnet journey. It has streamlined the number of SOE by eliminating redundancies and provided more clarity in how to meet the standards. Nevertheless, the Magnet model continues to be the framework of the application process. (See Figure a ) In the 2014 application manual, there is an increased focus on empirical outcomes in the different areas of our operations - quality, patient safety, staff and customer satisfaction, efficiency, organizational outcomes, evidence -based practice, innovation and research. Now, more than ever, data collection and measurement of the impact of various projects are essential. As we are in the writing phase of our Magnet application, in this report you will be given a preview of SOE and the stories already written to meet these requirements. The editorial staff hopes that these stories of excellence will bring more awareness of our employee's commitment and dedication towards improving the care we provide and the difference that we are making on our patients, organization and community. We further hope that these stories will continue to inspire us as the pursuit of excellence is never ending Figure a: Magnet Recognition Program Model TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP Transformational Leadership (TL) calls for effective leadership at all levels \u2014from the hospital executives to the bedside staff. This requires leadership that transforms organizational beliefs, values and philosophy to achieve better patient and staff outcomes. Transformational leaders lead people where they need to go in order to meet future demands. 4 Strategic Planning Nursing Strategic Objectives As we have done for the past 4 years, the process of identifying the nursing strategic objectives has been a true collaborative endeavor by nurses at all levels. Here are some of the highlights of our major accomplishments for FY 13. Achieved 80% hospital -wide SG council meeting attendance Maintained NDNQI RN Job enjoyment at highly satisfied level (T score=65.01) Sustained overall patient satisfaction with nursing above 90th percentile (Press Ganey score = 94.25 percentile) Kept physician satisfaction with nursing at 94 percentile Maintained department total expense per unit of service below budget Increased number of RN participation in community outreach programs by 8% and number of events participated in by 86% Decreased diabetes readmission by 5.38% (all payers) In October, our nursing, shared governance and UPC leaders embarked on a one -day retreat to develop the FY 14 nursing service department strategic goals. The goals identified were aligned with the system and hospital strategic plan, nursing mission and vision, and Magnet model components. Here are our goals for this fiscal year. Figure b: FY 2014 Nursing Service Department Strategic Goals Increase certification of clinical nurses by 2%. Reduce median time by 2% for: a. \"ED request to bed occupied\" b. \"bed assigned to bed occupied\"Falls with injuries to exceed NDNQI benchmark in last 8 quarters for 3/5 departmentsManagers at or below budget with respect to expense per unit of service and productive hours per unit of service.Decrease CHF readmission rate by 8%. Increase completed BSN and higher among clinical nurses by 2% Decrease staff turnover rate to below 7% Nursing Strategic Goals FY14 5 Advocacy and Influence Magnet Source of Evidence: TL3EO The CNO influences organization -wide change beyond the scope of nursing. Provide one example with supporting evidence, of a CNO -influenced positive change that had organization -wide impact beyond the scope of nursing services. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. BACKGROUND/PROBLEM The Birth of the Laborist Program Homestead Hospital's Chief Nursing Officer, Gail Gordon, RN, identified an improvement opportunity in providing adequate intrapartum pain relief in the Labor and Delivery department related to the availability of epidural anesthesia. In October to December 2012, Homestead Hospital provided 29% of laboring women with epidural or spinal pain relief. This number was low compared to the 2011 National Vital Statistics report that documented 61% of women with singleton deliveries received epidural or spinal anesthesia for pain relief during labor. The physician component played a significant role in epidural availability when the American Academy of Anesthesiologists changed its recommendations. The practice change required a physician examination prior to epidural placement and for the doctor to be in -house while the epidural was being placed. This became a huge workload challenge among the obstetric (OB) physicians who were all running solo practices. The Joint Commission (TJC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recognize pain as the 5th vital sign and concur that it is a patient's right to be offered adequate pain relief. In 2011, the Press Ganey Inpatient pa- tient satisfaction scores on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) \"Pain well controlled\" response was at the 71st percentile. In the third quarter of 2013, the \"Pain well controlled\" response was at the 89th percentile. Gordon collaborated with Chief Executive Officer, William Duquette, and made the initial push by beginning a review of the existing practices and policies on epidural administration. In the process, she recognized other areas of concern brought forward by the L&D Registered Nurses (RNs) related to the increased rate of unattended deliveries and the perceived high patient acuity due to high risk, unassigned obstetric patient volumes in the emergency department. In October - December of 2012, Homestead Hospital had 6.2% unattended deliveries, higher than the US Department of Health and Human Services benchmark of 2.5%. Gordon then negotiated with senior leadership for the inclusion of this priority area into the organizational strategic goal for FY 2013. GOAL STATEMENT(S) The goal was to provide in -house 24/7 obstetric/gynecology (OB/GYN) physician coverage in order to: epidural/spinal percentage by 10%, from 29% to 39%. 2. Decrease unattended delivery percentage by 2%, from 6.2% to 4.2%. The measures used to demonstrate improvement were as follows: 1. Percent Epidural/Spinal = Number of Patients Receiving a Labor Epidural/Spinal X 100 Total Number of Patients that Actively Labored 2. Percent Unattended delivery = Number of Unattended Deliveries X 100 Total Number of Deliveries DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION/INITIATIVE/ACTIVITY(IES) Early in FY 12, Gordon recruited and on -boarded Jan Weatherspoon, RN, Perinatal Services nursing director to help her develop a Laborist program. Weatherspoon has a strong operational background; previous experience with laborist models; and a proven track record as a change agent. In response to the ideas collected from Perinatal RNs during round tables; research into national/community standards and best practices; and extensive literature review, Gordon formed an interprofessional taskforce to further explore the possibility of implementing an OB hospitalist/Laborist group at Homestead Hospital. The team which initially met in November 2012 consisted of senior leadership, an administrative project analyst, OB anesthesia and neonatal physicians, OB nurse leader and OB educator. 6 Throughout 2012, the committee began by reviewing existing obstetric hospitalist models and brainstorming on different ideas for program implementation. The team enlisted the expertise of an external consultant who provided the group with examples of successful models and indications for the different models. They also conducted a cost/benefit analysis to assess the viability of the program. They examined data such as delivery volumes, triage numbers, emergency room assessments, epidural utilization and nurse delivery rates. The data collection and cost/benefit analysis processes were lengthy and took a period of 12 months. Several corporate and hospital departments were involved in the vetting process as follows: 1. Strategic planning - Validated the volume assumptions & revenue projections (based upon historical data). 2. Internal Controls Management, Acquisitions - Facilitated the due diligence and validated the facility pro forma. 3. Admitting - Worked through the registration process flow including service codes for patient status transfers. 4. ED Charge Specialist - worked with Homestead Hospital's Perinatal Services to develop the OB triage leveling process and charge entry. 5. Patient Access / Corporate Registration - approved adding a new hospital service (OBE = OB Emergency Department) that interfaced with Essentris (OB electronic medical record) for fetal monitoring and T -Systems (ED electronic medical record). 6. Clinical Business Systems: IT - Tested interface of new service to all ancillary services (other than Essentris and T -Systems) and interface functionality from Invision to Essentris and T -Systems. 7. Revenue Pricing & Analysis - Added the appropriate charge code to the existing OB triage beds in L&D. 8. Homestead Hospital Finance \u00ad Opened a new cost center as an extension of the ED (i.e., 400 -3035) 9. Clinical Business Consultant: IT (T -Systems) - created the Homestead Labor & Delivery Triage area in T-Systems for physician documentation. 10. IT Financial System/Physician Services - provided the Laborist group with remote access to NetAccess (inpatient electronic medical record). 11. Health Information System - facilitated physician documentation in T -System. Thereafter, the committee identified an existing physician vendor and formulated a new model that fit the unique culture and needs of Homestead Hospital by combining ideas from various existing models. In collaboration with the physicians, Weatherspoon developed the Laborist Scope of Services, which delineated the physician responsibilities to include quality and data collection. Initially, two physicians were recruited. On May 1st 2013, the first two Laborist physicians began to see patients. Locum physicians were used to cover a 24/7 in -house schedule until permanent physicians were recruited. Once the recruitment was completed, the laborists consisted of two male and two female OB/GYN physicians, who shared 24/7 in -house responsibilities for OB/GYN coverage. This fulfilled the need for a physi- cian to be in -house for epidural placement, to care for OB/GYN ED patients without primary physician cover- age and to respond to any emergencies. The physician's lounge was renovated to provide more comfortable accommodations to the new and existing doctors. Additionally, Clinical Nurse Educator Kathy Adamson, RN, rolled -out the education to inform the Perinatal staff of the new process flow. With the approval of the Medical Executive Committee, the laborists started consulting patients throughout the hospital. Due to the unanticipated gynecological volume, the group intends to add a 5th physician which will allow for one physician 24/7 and one physician Monday through Friday 9 -5 to accommodate the gynecology patient volumes and faster response time to patient consults in the ED. In the FY 2013 budget, an initial $1.3 million was allocated to ensure the program was financially supported through the first year. The FY 2014 budget reflected a reduction in the assessed monetary shortfall to $844,951 suggesting that the revenues collected by the laborist group has helped to off -set the initial start -up cost of the program.

ABCDE Bundle Implementation in ICU: The ABC Part BACKGROUND/PROBLEM The ABCDE Bundle is a group of evidence -based interventions that can help prevent the unintended consequences of critical illness endorsed by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN). It is targeted towards mechanically ventilated patients although components of it may be used for all patients. Certain elements of the bundle involve the inter -professional team, including respiratory therapists, physical therapists, pharmacists, dietitians, and physicians, among others. The components of the ABCDE Bundle are: 1. ABC - Awakening and Breathing Trial Coordination Over sedation and under sedation can lead to prolonged ventilator times among patients. This \"ABC\" bundle component addresses daily Spontaneous Awakening Trials (SAT) and Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBT) to promote earlier extubation. 2. D - Delirium Assessment and Management Critically -ill patients are susceptible to developing delirium. Unfortunately, delirium often goes undetected and untreated in scores of patients, potentially leading to a host of negative long -term consequences. This \"D\" bundle component addresses early identification and management of patients with delirium. 3. E - Early Exercise and Progressive Mobility Patients with prolonged bed rest or immobility are prone to developing muscle weakness and atrophy, which can lead to a longer hospital stay and long -term muscle dysfunction. This \"E\" bundle component provides guidance for enabling patients to become progressively more active and, possibly walk while intubated. Nurse's Participation in a Professional Development Activity In May of 2012, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) Rosemary Lee, ARNP, attended the AACN National Teaching Institute (NTI) in Orlando, Florida. Lee is a member of AACN and active on the local and national level. She has presented several poster and podium presentations during these conferences. At this particular NTI conference, the organization rolled out its \"AACN Pearls\" which is a toolkit for clinicians to implement the ABCDE Bundle. After the conference, Lee proceeded to evaluate current ICU practice on mechanically ventilated patients in relation to the ABCDE bundle. The following is a summary of her findings based on existing practice: 1. Nurses did not independently initiate SAT because a physician's order was required. 2. Nurses and respiratory therapists (RT's) were unsure when to coordinate the SAT and SBT, or whether the patient is stable enough to perform the SAT/SBT. 3. Nurses did not perform routine delirium assessment. 4. Inter -professional teams did not follow specific guidelines on steadily mobilizing intubated patients. Using the \"AACN Roadmap for Implementing Change - ABCDE Bundle\" as a guide, Lee presented the bundle to key stakeholders: ICU Medical Director, Pulmonary Physician, ICU Director & Nurse Manager, Respiratory Supervisor, Clinical Pharmacist, ICU Unit Practice Council and the Rehabilitative Services Director. They all supported the implementation of the ABCDE bundle. Consequently, Lee formed an inter-professional group who performed the \"AACN Unit Gap Analysis\" tool to assess strengths and areas of opportunities. 14 GOAL STATEMENT(S) Since there is no benchmark readily available specific to the general ICU population it was decided to decrease the complications of critical illness by decreasing median ventilator time by 10% from base- line of 58.75 median hours to 52.87 median hours. Median was calculated by Calculated actual times of each patient on a ventilator per month equals Time of arrival to the ICU on ventilator Time of extubation Each time was collated and median time in hours was calculated per month. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: Limitations in care were provided (e.g. DNR/ Comfort Measure Only) Withdrawal of life support was done Patient suffered cardiopulmonary arrest within the first 24 hours of admission. Patients who failed traditional ventilator weaning and required tracheostomy. Patients who were transferred to another acute care facility. DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION/INITIATIVE/ACTIVITY (IES) The ABCDE Bundle Task Force first met on September 2012. The team initially focused on addressing and prioritizing identified gaps, specifically on the ABC component of the bundle. They revised policies & proce- dures to reflect this new practice. The prior policy was named \"Drug Holiday Protocol\" which focused on the nursing management of sedation for mechanically ventilated patients based on physician's orders. This in- cluded basic guidelines for assessment and reassessment based on prescribed orders. The new policy, de- veloped in February 2013, provided guidelines and practice changes to allow nurses and respiratory thera- pists to be proactive in the assessment, implementation, and evaluation of a patient's ability to begin the weaning process. It enabled the nurse to independently stop sedation and for the respiratory therapist to initi- ate breathing trial if the patient met criteria for the SAT & SBT. The ICU Medical Director and Medical Direc- tor of Pulmonary services approved all policies and procedures. From February to April 2013, Lee, Clinical Nurse Joyce Nealey, RN and Palliative Care Manager Linda Long, ARNP educated the ICU nursing staff on the evidence, policy/procedure and expectations regarding sponta- neous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials. She conducted the education after staff meetings and scheduled additional in -services that covered various shifts. Respiratory Nurse Educator Eda Avila, RN, RRT provided the education to the respiratory care providers. Thereafter, the taskforce implemented the ABC portion of the bundle on April 15, 2013. Utilizing the Kirkpatrick's 4 Level Evaluation Model as framework, the team evaluated the education program was as follows: Step 1: Reaction - The overall reaction of the staff was positive. Initially, they were hesitant about imple- menting SAT and SBT without a written physician order. Lopetegui and Martinez provided encouragement to the staff which enabled them to move forward. Step 2: Learning - Lee reviewed clinical nurses' documentation through chart checks for accuracy in cal- culating the RASS and provided them feedback. Step 3: Behavior - The team observed the clinical nurses using the RASS score more consistently dur- ing the daily interprofessional rounds. Step 4: Results - See outcomes graph. 15 PARTICIPANTS: The members of ABCDE Bundle Task Force were as follows: Name/Credentials Title Department Role in the Team Rosemary Lee DNP, ARNP - BC, CCNS, Nurse RN Clinical ICU/PCU Member Onyinye Clinical ICU/PCU Harrison, RN, Supervi- sor Member Espino MSN, RN, CCRN Patient Supervi- sor ICU/PCU Member Everett BSN, RN, CCRN Patient Care Man- ager ICU/PCU Member, Critical Ana Cabrera DNP, ARNP, ANP -BC, CCRN, NEA -BC Director Critical Long, MSN, ARNP -BC, GNP -BC, CHPN Manager Palliative Care BSN, RN, RRT Tatiana Ortiz, RD Dietitian Dietary Services Member Suzanne Lopez Physical Therapist Rehabilitation Services Member Michelle Sinclair Physical Therapist Rehabilitation Services Member Eda Avila BSN, RN, RRT Clinical Nurse Educa- tor Respiratory Therapy Member, education of respiratory therapists Christopher Freeman, RRT Respiratory Therapist Respiratory Therapy Member Rollene Price, RRT Supervisor Respiratory Therapy Member, Respiratory Leadership Support Winifred Pardo, PharmD Clinical Pharmacist Pharmacy Member, review of sedation and nalgesic agents Juan Lopetegui, MD Medical Director Critical Care Physician Champion Carlos Martinez, MD Medical Director Pulmonary Services Physician Supporter 16 OUTCOME: Improvement in Patient Care Outcome Figure e: Median Ventilation Hours, ICU Analysis: The post ABC implementation data indicates a significant decrease in the median hours on the ventilator. The first 3 months an average median time of 32.18 hours was achieved. In July, a marked increase was seen. Upon review, this increase was related to several high acuity patients with prolonged ICU stay and overall hospitalization. The following months, August to November 2013 the average median time once again declined to 33.88 hours, a 42% decrease in the average median time from prior to implementation. Future of ABCDE Bundle: The interdisciplinary team continues to meet in order to achieve the ultimate goal of implementing all components of the ABCDE Bundle. Commitment to Community Involvement Dorothy Levielle, R.N. - 2013 March of Dimes Winner Magnet Source of Evidence: SE9 The organization supports nurses' participation in community healthcare outreach. Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of organizational support for clinical nurse involvement in community healthcare outreach. Homestead Hospital's very own Dorothy Leveille, R.N., MS5, was recently named the March of Dimes 2013 Nurse of the Year (Medical/Surgical category) for Miami -Dade and Monroe counties. She was honored for her extraordinary patient care, compassion and service. The Nov. 22 awards ceremony celebrated nurses and the critical role they play as healthcare providers, educators, researchers, fundraisers, volunteers and advisors. Marjorie Lozama nominated Ms. Leveille. Here is an excerpt of her nomination: \"Ms. Leveille received her nursing degree from Barry University. Dorothy's work model is to form a good relationship with patients and their families and use effective communication to respond to their needs. She loves to teach and served as a preceptor for new hires. Her passion for teaching motivated her to pursue a Masters degree in Nursing. She believes in providing holistic care to her patients to ensure optimal health. She is generous with her time and money. She uses her money to help the less fortunate and travels on medical missions to serve the unprivileged and underserved population of Haiti and Bateyes of Dominican 17 Republic. She likes to make people feel better and she goes above and beyond to respond to her patients' and friends' needs. She is loving, caring, and compassionate and makes a positive difference every day in people's lives. She is a great example of caring.\" Reflection: An Immortal Dream By Dorothy Leveille, R.N. \"Dream: if you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream, you can become it. -William Arthur Ward, 1921 -1994 Everything starts with just a dream. I call my education an immortal dream. When I came to the United States from Haiti, I did not even have a high school diploma, but I was always dreaming of acquiring a good education in order to become more useful to society. I attended Sunset High School at night and completed my high school education. Then, wasting no time, I went to Miami Dade College and earned an Associate Degree in Pharmacy; and the dream continued. I later attended Barry University and obtained a Bachelor's degree in Nursing. When I started my journey as a professional nurse, I had no idea what it was really all about. Everything seemed so new to me. It took me a while to grasp the full meaning of being a licensed Registered Nurse. As an RN, I am now able to provide care for patients in hospitals and other communities. I am eternally grateful for that opportunity. I thank Baptist Health for all the assistance they gave me especially through the Nurse Scholar Partner Program. I recently enrolled in Florida International University to pursue a Master's degree in Public Health. I am extremely lucky for having lived in the \"land of opportunity\". I was convinced that if God gave me the opportunity to realize some of my dreams, I must give something back. Wasting no time, I went on a quest for non -profit organizations where I could volunteer my services. I registered to different non-profit organizations but the Haitian American Nurse Association (HANA) had a special spot in my heart. That institution has accelerated my professional growth several times over. I am very happy and proud to be a part of both the HANA and Baptist Health families. There are so many opportunities to grow and work with great people while acquiring knowledge and experience to become a better person and a better nurse every day. I ask God to always guide my hands in order to provide efficient and effective care to others. God bless Baptist Health and HANA. God bless the United States and the world. EXEMPLARY PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE Exemplary Professional Practice (EP) means our practice is grounded in a culture of safety, quality improvement, quality monitoring, inter -professional collaboration, partnership with patient and family and care coordination. Our team utilizes the professional practice model (PPM) and care delivery system as frameworks for practice and provision of care. This component also focuses on best practices that result in excellent out- comes and comparing our performance to national benchmarks. Professional Practice Model With the Nursing Mission and Vision statements laying down the purpose and direction, the Homestead Hospital nursing team, signified by the trunk, is able to promote a Professional Practice Model, illustrated in Figure f that embodies its nursing philosophy. There are 5 components to the model, namely: collaboration, professional development, clinical practice, communication and care delivery system. These components are represented by the tree branches converging in the middle and cradling the nest. The nest symbolizes patient and family, the core of care, nurtured and protected by the branches. The bird represents external and internal challenges embraced by the nursing team to meet the demands of the future. Collaboration We practice collaboration in our relationships with patients & families, community and interdisciplinary team through shared decision -making. This is demonstrated by a robust shared governance model composed of unit practice councils (UPC) in each nursing department and hospital -wide councils. The UPCs are comprised of staff from different job titles within 18 the unit and allied team members are engaged when needed. Teamwork, collegiality, respect for diversity and community partnership are important for care coordination that are valued and nurtured throughout the organization. Professional Development We are accountable for our professional development and recognize advancement through the professional nursing advancement program (PNAP) and formal recognition activities. Figure f: Homestead Hospital Professional Practice Model Nursing leaders promote the thrust for lifelong learning and individual RN accountability for keeping up with educational, licensure and competency requirements. This is supported through tuition reimbursement, scholarship programs, conference grants and free continuing education programs offered onsite and on the web. Increasing formal education and board certification is a focus in the FY 2014 Nursing Strategic Goal. Professional accomplishments are celebrated through the PNAP and a myriad of recognition programs such as the DAISY award for extraordinary nurse, nurse of the year, certified nurses' day, publications, pins and congratulatory letters. Clinical Practice We practice in an environment where quality, patient safety, evidence -based practice and research are emphasized to achieve the best patient and family outcomes. Guided by the nursing mission statement, Homestead Hospital's nursing staff is committed to being the leader in providing quality, safe and evidence -based care. They accomplish this with a focus on outcomes and utilization of best practice, national, regulatory and specialty guidelines in providing care. They are early adopters and often volunteer as pilot sites for new projects. They are also in the forefront of innovation and new knowledge generation by engaging in research activities. Communication We are in constant communication with each other, the interdisciplinary team and patients & families regarding the plan of care. The Homestead Hospital nursing staff recognizes that effective communication is vital in providing safe care to 19 patient and family. It is an expectation in the Baptist Health South Florida (BHSF) Service Excellence standards. Nurses utilize formal and informal channels of communications. The shared governance councils - unit based and hospital -wide - afford a more formal method where communication flows vertically and horizontally. Messages are also delivered and received in staff meetings, employee and nursing forums, memos, newsletters, and emails. Nurses utilize bedside shift report, hourly rounding, interdisciplinary rounding and standardized format for hand -off communication such as Situation -Background -Assessment - Recommendation (SBAR), order read back and time -out to communicate with each other, the Inter - professional team, and the patient/family. Care Delivery System We utilize the comfort theory and patient - and family -centered care as frameworks for care delivery. Figure g: Homestead Hospital Care Delivery System While the PPM is the driving force of Homestead Hospital's nursing care, the care delivery system delineates how care is delivered. Homestead Hospital's care delivery system depicted in Figure g is a component of the PPM. It emphasizes the role of clinical nurses as primary caregivers. It delineates the nurses' authority and accountability for clinical decision -making and outcomes of care provided based on regulatory standards such as the Nurse Practice Act and utilization of the nursing process. It further describes the resources available to the nursing staff and the importance of partnerships, shared decision -making and communication in the deliv- ery of care. Patient -and Family -Centered Care The Homestead Hospital nursing team adopts patient -and family -centered care and comfort theory as the overarching theoretical frameworks in the care delivery system. Patient - and family -centered care is an approach to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of healthcare which is a mutually beneficial partnership between patients, patients' families, caregivers and healthcare providers (http://www.ipfcc.org/faq.html). Its premise is based on true partnerships with patients and families. This entails involving them in care decisions and obtaining the benefits of their help and insights in the plan of care to achieve better patient/family and organizational outcomes with staff satisfaction . Several initiatives have been implemented to promote patient -and family -centered care. For example, the visitation policy has been revised to reflect open visitation for family and friends. A Patient -and Family - Centered Care Council has been formed and meets quarterly with patient/family advisors as members 20 representing the community. In late 2012, a patient/family resource center was opened in the exterior section of the Medical Library where patients and families could access supplemental, reliable medical literature and the internet. Comfort Theory Comfort theory, developed by Dr. Katharine Kolcaba, RN, has its major underpinning in the holistic comfort needs that human beings have. She advocates that it is an important mission for the healthcare team to meet these comfort needs. When patients and families experience enhance comfort, they engage in health -seeking behaviors that lead to better outcomes and institutional integrity. Homestead Hospital nurses have fully embraced these concepts because of the unique opportunity through interactions with patients and families in partnering with and meeting their holistic comfort needs. Different teams have embarked on various projects using the Comfort theory as framework. Pastoral Care Services spearheaded music in the front lobby where a volunteer plays soothing piano music during designated times of the day. They also initiated \"Prayer Time\" daily in the chapel at 3 pm where everybody is invited to attend. The Volunteer Services department in collaboration with the Patient -and Family -Centered Care Council implemented the mobile art cart that is taken around the hospital by a volunteer with previous Arts training twice a week. The Perinatal department has a \"Cuddler\" program where select and pre -screened volunteers dedicate time to hold, feed and change diapers of newborns. They also started the bereavement program to assist families with fetal demise through the grieving process. The Unit Practice Council (UPC) Collaborative Committee composed of all UPC chairs developed an Interprofessional Creed that is recited prior to the start of shared governance meetings. The creed reminds us of our mission as an inter -professional team and helps sets the right tone for the meeting. Culture of Safety Magnet Source of Evidence: EP21EO - Nurses are involved in implementing and evaluating national or international patient safety goals. Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of nurses' involvement in activities that address national or international patient safety goals that led to an improvement in patient safety outcomes. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data. Blood Management Program BACKGROUND/PROBLEM Transfusion of blood products is one of the most common interventions in the hospital setting. Although the blood supply is the safest it has ever been, transfusion of blood components remains a high -risk procedure. Each transfusion exposes patients to a variety of potentially serious complications. Therefore, unnecessary transfusions make little sense in view of the potential harm (Boucher, Hannon, 2007). A blood transfusion is in fact, a liquid transplant and there are safety concerns with adverse effects of allogeneic transplantation. Some of the adverse effects that can occur are infectious complications, febrile and allergic reactions, hemolytic transfusion reactions or other types of reactions such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), transfusion -related cardiac overload (TACO), transfusion -related acute long injury (TRALI), and transfusion -related immunomodulation (TRIM) to name a few. (Institute for Healthcare Improvement [IHI] Ex- pedition: The Appropriate Use of Blood Products 2011). The New England Journal of Medicine published the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial on February 11, 1999. In this landmark study, 838 anemic critically ill patients were prospectively randomized Homestead Hospital Interprofessional Creed Homestead Hospital believes in providing compassionate, high quality and evidence -based care to the community that we serve. We are committed to upholding the integrity and mission of Baptist Health South Florida. Regardless of roles, our staff members and medical providers believe in addressing the cultural and spiritual needs of our patients through advocacy and inter -professional approach. We believe in holding ourselves accountable for promoting our own educational and professional advancement to provide quality care. We believe in the healing presence of God to help us overcome every temporal weakness, and to strengthen us so 21 into one of two treatment strategies: transfuse at a Hgb level of 10 gm/dl, a very traditional approach to these challenging patients, or transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 7 gm/dl, which was a significant departure from common practice in 1999. The results changed the practice of transfusion medicine because the patients who were transfused at the more liberal trigger of 10 gm/dl had substantially worse outcomes than those transfused at the more conservative trigger of 7 gm/dl. Unfortunately, many practitioners have only a vague understanding of the complexities associated with blood transfusion therapy. Studies have shown that there is a variation in blood transfusion practices between institutions and even among different practitioners in the same institution (Boucher, Hannon -, 2007). The decision to transfuse is also often based more upon custom and habit rather than formal training and current evidence based principles. (IHI Expedition: The Appropriate Use of Blood Products, 2011). The Joint Commission (TJC) proposed a new National Patient Safety Goal (NPSG) 16.01.01 to minimize the overuse of tests, treatments, and procedures and reduce the risk of patient harm including red blood cell transfusions. This was going to take effect on January 1, 2013. To proactively meet this requirement, Homestead Hospital participated in an IHI expedition for the \"Appropriate Use of Blood Products\" in February 2011. The program elucidated how to build an effective blood product management program, test and implement changes that would produce cost savings, improve the quality of care, and raise the bar on patient safety. Performance Improvement (PI) Nurse Patricia Yulkowski, RN was one of the expedition's participants. After the IHI expedition, Yulkowski looked at the ACS NSQIP summary report from 01/01/2011 - 12/31/2011 that looked at red blood cell (RBC) transfusions administered intraoperatively and postoperatively within 72 hours of surgery start time. The Homestead Hospital's transfusion rate was at 10.4% compared to the ACS NSQIP comparison group rate of 6.0%. It showed that Homestead Hospital had an opportunity for improvement with blood over usage intraoperatively and postoperatively. Yulkowski delved further and expanded the data collection to all RBC transfusions administered and the Hgb threshold the transfusions that were ordered for the entire hospital. She broke down the data by medical specialty. It showed that Homestead Hospital was transfusing RBC's 69% of the time for a Hgb greater than 7. Best practice indicated that patients should be transfused at Hgb of less than 7 (IHI Expedition: The Appropriate Use of Blood Products, 2011). This information was reported at the Critical Care Committee. In May 2012, a Blood Utilization Task Force was formed. The team consisted of physician chiefs from various specialties, Critical Care Director and PI nurse. Yulkowski was named the hospital -wide champion and team leader. GOAL STATEMENT(S) The goal of the Blood Utilization Task Force was to decrease transfusion rates for Hgb greater than 7g/dl by 2%, from 69% to 67%. Outcome was determined using the following measure: % Hgb transfused greater than 7g/dL = Number of transfusions administered for an Hgb greater than 7 per month Total amount of transfusions administered for the entire month DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION/INITIATIVE/ACTIVITY(IES) The team utilized the Plan -Do-Check -Act (PDCA) PI model to guide their inquiry and interventions. Plan The task force's initial thrust was building blood transfusion order sets. This would streamline the blood transfusion ordering process and provide prompts for the ordering practitioner on the appropriate indications for the procedure. The hospital data Yulkowski collected showed that the medical specialty transfusing the most was the Internal Medicine group consisting mainly of the hospitalists. In 2012, they accounted for 48% of all transfusions ordered. Yulkowski decided to direct the educational intervention on the new evidence -based blood transfusion guidelines to this specialty. Do The blood transfusion order sets were approved in Homestead Hospital on September 2012. However, it needed to be approved at the Baptist Health system level in order to be built into the computerized physician order entry (CPOE). It took almost a year for the order set to be approved. Additionally, the CPOE build was further delayed due to a systems upgrade and the construction of a new electronic medical record (EMR) sys- tem that will replace the current system. In the interim, Yulkowski put together a Power Point presentation and articles with the new evidence -based transfusion guidelines. She presented it at the hospitalist's meeting on February 2013. She also coordinated related CME activities for the nurses and physicians held at the physician's lounge and placed informational posters in strategic locations throughout the hospital. 22 Check After the presentation to the hospitalists, the data showed immediate improvement but did not yield sustained results. Yulkowski presented this to the Critical Care Committee and to the rest of the Blood Utilization Task Force members. She decided to take another approach. In January 2013, she drilled down by individual Internal Medicine physician to determine where the outliers existed. This would enable the physicians to evaluate individual performance compared to their peers and promote practitioner accountability. Act In July 2013, Yulkowski met with Internal Medicine Chief and Head Hospitalist Dr. Mark Hernandez. She presented the scorecard for each physician and reiterated the new evidence -based transfusion guidelines. She followed this up with an email sent to the entire hospitalist group regarding the new guidelines with a graph showing the hospital's transfusion rates. Hernandez invited Yulkowski to another hospitalist meeting on September 2013 to reeducate the physicians. At this meeting, she presented them with their individual transfu- sion rates compared to their peers. In October 2013, just one month after the presentation, the data already showed huge improvement with 50% of all blood transfusions transfused at a Hgb greater than 7. While waiting for the CPOE build of the transfusion order set to be completed, Yulkowski continued with data collection, phy- sician reeducation and feedback on their transfusion rates on a monthly basis.

Quality Care, Monitoring and Improvement Magnet Moments: Gratitude from a former patient By Andrew Seaman, R.N. Figure i: Former patients Estrella Gonzalez Rojas and husband, Alexander Rojas Estrella Gonzalez Rojas was an independent woman who loved to stay busy. She enjoyed her days cooking savory Latin food for her family and friends. But in the last few months, the usually healthy 70 -year-old woman was not feeling well. She was in pain and weak. She knew she should probably be seen by a doctor, but home was where she wanted to stay. It was her sanctuary. A hospital was the last place that she wanted to be. Her husband, Alexander, sensed that she was ill. He knew right away that something wasn't right. They had been married for fifty years. Estrella was the love of his life. They had raised two children and now they enjoyed their time with their five grandchildren. He was not going to give in to any of her objections. Alexander, who had served 24 years in the military, was used to giving orders and having them followed. Estrella admitted to being equally hardheaded. \"I almost blew a fuse,\" she said adding \"but in the end, I listened to him.\" Alexander had no hesitation about choosing Homestead Hospital for her care. He had been here previously as a patient. The exceptional care that he had received had left a lasting impression with him. His confidence and trust in our facility eased her mind. She stated that once they arrived in the emergency department (ED), \"it was like a walk in the park.\" She stated that the process from arrival to treatment was seamless. She said, that the registration personnel \"were willing to go the extra mile to get the job done.\" Estrella noted that Pamela Borrero, RN, ED and Computed Tomography (CT) Technologist Chris Kerek were ED personnel who stood out in her mind as having gone above and beyond. Estrella added that ED Physician Dr. Paul Rohart was also very attentive and professional. Once she was admitted, Estrella was taken upstairs to room 4023. She said, \"I thought I was at the Hilton or Hyatt and not in a hospital.\" She related that on her first night here, Jill Dimeola, RN and Care Partner (CP) Maribel Velasquez continued \"the special care and attention to detail.\" On her second day here, she noted that the wonderful caring was continued by Esther Birchall, RN, Kelly Borgardt, RN, CP Edith Jean Jacques, and CP Jeffrey Ferguson. There was one issue that came up - an IV site had been causing her discomfort. Estrella said that Esther immediately looked at it and changed it to a different site. She added that she was floored by all the constant attention, all of which was delivered with a smile by every employee. Pamela Borrero, RN, stated that \"people often come here during their worst moments. It's important to smile and let them know that you are going to do whatever you can to help them. It matters.\" 24 On her third and fourth days here, Estrella wanted to make sure that the following employees were also recognized for their wonderful caring and compassion, namely: Robin Gibson, RN, her discharge home, Estrella said that Clinical Dietician Kelly La Rocco Keefe, RD, spent a lot of time with her discussing the benefits of a specific diet she was to follow at home. She also wanted to especially recognize the entire personnel in charge of cleaning and maintaining the halls and rooms. She stated the whole hospital looked so clean as if it were ready for an inspection. Estrella stated that years ago her parents taught her the importance of always displaying a \"gratitude attitude\" and to recognize exceptional dedication and caring. She noted that \"without exaggeration, I felt that I was not in a hospital setting.\" Estrella said that it was clearly evident her positive experience stemmed from the effec- tive leadership of CEO Bill Duquette which trickled down to the staff. She gave a heartfelt thank you and said \"YOU GUYS ARE GREAT! Thanks for taking care of me.\" Accountability, Competence and Autonomy Magnet Source of Evidence: EP14 Resources, such as professional literature, are readily available to sup- port decision -making in autonomous nursing practice. Provide examples, with supporting evidence, of how resources are used to support evidence -based clinical decision -making in autonomous nursing practice. Example 1 Medical Library E -Resources BACKGROUND Homestead Hospital and Baptist Health South Florida (BHSF) consider employees as their most valuable as- set and as such invest a multitude of resources for the education, professional development and clinical sup- port of their employees. The Medical Library is part of the services provided by the Center for Research and Grants, which is the research hub for BHSF. This corporate department provides research leadership, support, and education for physicians, nurses, research coordinators, administrators and students. The Medical Library is a corporate function and had been in existence since 1961. It is headed by Medical Library Services Director Devica Samsundar, MLIS, AHIP. Its staff consists of 2 medical librarians, John Reynolds, MLIS and Carrie Figueredo, MLIS, four library coordinators and two part time library service assistants. The Medical Library has always been ahead of the curve. They had a vision of bringing staff the lat- est evidence in a timely fashion. To fulfill this vision, they developed very early on their vast array of online re- sources in 1995 to complement the traditional brick -and-mortar locations. Type of Resources Readily Available to Nurses The medical library supports all BHSF employees, including nurses and medical staff, through its robust online resources called \"E -Resources\" and physical locations in various campuses. Its services include: 1. Computerized literature searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, Mosby's Nursing Consult and other evidence -based health and business databases 2. Document delivery to users electronically, by e -mail, fax, photocopy or mail (for articles from their journals or other libraries in hospitals and medical schools in the United States, including the National Library of Medicine) 3. Access to core reference and journal collection 4. Circulation and interlibrary loan of books and DVDs for ongoing learning 5. Electronic access to OVID MEDLINE and other databases and e -textbooks and e -journals (from offices and home, after library hours, using the ATHNENS portal 6. Educating library users regarding effective searching for evidence based resources, relative to the provision of excellent health care to patients Fully embracing patient -and family -centered care, the physical library sites welcome patients, families and their visitors to come in during office hours to access reliable supplemental patient education materials or to use the internet to connect with family and friends. 25 How Resources are used for Evidence -Based Clinical Decision -Making in Autonomous Nursing Practice Clinical Decision -Making and Clinical Autonomy Clinical autonomy refers to the authority and freedom of nurses to make nursing care decisions (within the full scope of their practice) in the clinical care of patients within interprofessional practice environments (Weston, 2008). The Medical Library invests a huge proportion of its budget subscribing to reliable medical databases, e -books and e -journals which are peer reviewed and regularly updated. This ensures staff has access to the latest evidence to guide them with clinical decision -making and clinical autonomy. The plethora of E -Resources is available to all staff 24 -7 through the intranet or internet. When the employees are within the hospital cam- pus, these online resources can be accessed through any desktop computer, laptop and work stations on wheels (WOWs) providing on demand support at their fingertips. When employees are outside of the hospital, they are still able to access the E -Resources remotely by requesting a personal log -in to Athens. The Mosby Suite, a nurse -specific reference, consisting of the Mosby Nursing Consult, Mosby's Nursing Skills and Mosby's Index is a more recent addition to the database. The initial subscription to this invaluable nursing resource in 2011 was realized through a grant from the corporate Centers for Excellence in Nursing (CEN). Nurses utilize the Mosby Nursing Consult as a one -stop shop for latest drug information, patient education, professional journals, reference books, current nursing news, clinical practice guidelines and standards, evi- dence -based content, and care planning tools. Mosby's Nursing Skills provide nurses access to a vast listing of nursing procedure. It has allowed streamlining of the policy and procedure manual and ease in locating clinical procedures at the point -of-care through its searchable feature. Mosby's Index offers a very robust journal ab- stracts and indexing database to nurses which are helpful with literature searches. Furthermore, Micromedex is the go -to place for nurses when they need detailed monographs for drugs, disease, alternative medicine, toxicological management, and patient education documents (available in English and Spanish). Staff can also suggest the purchase of reference materials which are helpful to their practice to the Medical Library Services Director. To further support nurses in clinical decision -making and clinical autonomy, the corporate office spearheaded a Policy Administration Management (PAM) system. PAM's goal is to be the resource center for all corporate and entity policies and attachments. PAM has allowed the migration of most policies and procedures and standing order forms online; provided a mechanism for regularly reviewing policies and procedures (P&P); and quicker turnaround time with posting of newly approved or reviewed P&P . Organizational Autonomy Organizational autonomy refers to the authority and freedom of a nurse to be involved in broader unit, service line, organization, or system decision -making processes pertaining to patient care, polices and procedures, and work environment (Weston, 2008). Through an active and well -developed Shared Governance structure, Homestead Hospital nurses are engaged in organizational and system -wide decision -making processes. These activities include policy development, product selection, committee work, performance improvement (PI) projects, adoption of evidence -based practice, (EBP) and conduct of research. When nurses need a review of literature to help them in the aforementioned activities, they can either access directly the E -Resources (CINAHL, Medline, and Mosby's Index) or request the help of the Medical Library with a database search or article reprints by sending an e -mail or approaching the library coordinators at the physical locations. Addition- ally, staff can request a one -on-one consult with dedicated Research Specialist Maria Ojeda, ARNP or the PI department. Employees can seek the assistance of these experts at any step in the process, but are highly en- couraged to consult them early on during the conceptual stages so that a well -thought out plan and outcomes measurement for the project can be laid out. Summary BHSF and Homestead Hospital invest considerable resources, both information management and human, for the nurses and the entire staff to support them with evidence -based clinical decision -making in autonomous nursing practice. Example 2 Transformation of an Office Space into a Physical Library BACKGROUND & PURPOSE Homestead Hospital did not have a physical library in its campus due to spatial limitations. As described above, employees utilized the E -Resources and corresponded with the Medical Library staff via email and phone when they need assistance with database search or article reprints. At times, staff visited the physical 26 sites located in the other two campuses to consult with library coordinators or medical librarian when they happened to be at these locations. In late 2011, a space utilized as a doctor's office in a centralized section of the hospital was vacated by the practice. While empty, the area was used as conference room for various council or committee meetings. In January 2012, a fortuitous conversation transpired between Medical Library Services Director Devica Samsundar and Homestead Hospital Magnet Project Director Julie David, ARNP. Samsundar expressed that she has an approved 1 full -time equivalent (FTE) for a library coordinator slated for a sister hospital, but they did not have the space to allocate for a library. David related to Samsundar the availability of an office space and its potential of becoming an ideal site for a physical library due to its size and location. Samsundar agreed to reallocate the open FTE to Homestead Hospital if the space can be secured and reconfigured into a library. Coincidentally during this time, Homestead Hospital Anesthesia Chief Samir Kulkarni, MD, became a benefactor and donated monies through the Foundation earmarked for the development of an employee and medical staff resource center. It was also around this time that the Patient -and Family -Centered Care Council completed their gap analysis. They identified as the number one priority the lack of a patient and family resource center accessible to patients, families, and staff. David developed a proposal to reconfigure the existing office space, using the earmarked Foundation funds, into an onsite medical library that would be staffed by library coordinator. Additionally, she proposed that the front part of the space be designed as patient and family resource center where patients and families could ac- cess supplemental, reliable medical literature and the internet. She pitched the idea to Chief Nursing Officer Gail Gordon, RN, Gordon. Gordon whole heartedly endorsed it to the senior executives who then approved it unanimously. METHODS & APPROACH Once approval was obtained, Samsundar and David immediately dove into project planning. A meeting took place in April 2012 with Samsundar, David, Support Services Vice President Corey Gold and Interior Designer Maria Saenz. They discussed the design, lay -out, furniture and equipment needs and set timelines for project completion. Concurrently, Samsundar also worked on hiring and on boarding library coordinator. Staying true to the spirit of shared governance , David put together an ad -hoc team from nursing, ancillary department and medical staff, represented by Kulkarni, to obtain input into the layout and review the plans. Devica met with the group, showed them the plan and solicited their suggestions. Thereafter, David completed the furniture purchase order . The project moved at a fast pace and a soft opening transpired in July 2012 followed by an official ribbon cutting ceremony in August 24, 2012. Due to austerity measures that were put into place in the middle of the year, the filling of library coordinator position was placed on hold. Despite this, Samsundar was still able to reallocate existing staff and provide a library coordinator Monday -Friday from 10 am to 2 pm. She also engaged the Volunteer Services department to help out with the staffing. Type of Resources Readily Available to Nurses The opening of an onsite library has been very well received by the nurses and the rest of the staff. In addition to the E -resources, they had experts on site with whom they could ask questions and dialogue with about their areas of interest. Additionally, the staff now had access to circulation materials such as CPR, ACLS books, general reference books, DVDs and certification review guides. For example, in 2012 the Medical Library added 45 nursing certification study guide books to its collection in the areas of Critical Care, Progressive Care, Emergency and Pediatric Emergency Nursing, NICU, Wound Care, Gastroenterology, Infusion Nursing, Perianesthesia Nursing, Neuroscience Nursing, Med -Surg Nursing, and Surgery Nursing. Selections were based on input from nurses and clinicians at all facilities. These books have been circulated 37 times through library and interlibrary loans. 27 Figure j: Medical Library Ribbon Cutting Ceremony How Resources are used for Evidence -Based Clinical Decision -Making in Autonomous Nursing Practice Clinical Decision -Making and Clinical Autonomy Having a library coordinator or medical librarian onsite is particularly convenient when nurses are looking for articles pertaining to a clinical problem or issue in practice that needs to be addressed. Nurses who pursue the Professional Nursing Advancement Program (PNAP) find this additional support helpful in putting together their portfolio, particularly, in fulfilling the evidence -based research project requirement. Additionally, employees now have an area for quiet time and reading. With a 24 -7 badge swipe access, this dedicated space has been a tremendous benefit for nurses who are going back to school for studying, doing research or online postings. Organizational Autonomy Nurse members of the Policy Workgroup are very enthused with having a physical library. They utilize its services when looking for policy references and often conduct their pre -meeting research in the library. The additional benefit brought about by the onsite library is the enhanced collaboration between its staff and the shared governance councils. The Evidence -Based Practice Council (EBPRC) partnered with the Medical Library in establishing a hospital -wide online journal club in September 2012.The club is called the \"Tree of Knowledge\", coined by Clinical Nurse, Debby Zorns, RN in reference to the nursing Professional Practice Model which has the shape of a tree. This online forum is open to all RNs and some ancillary departments. Unit Practice Councils (UPC) rotate on a monthly basis in selecting articles in their areas of interest and initiating the discussion. Nurses who participate in the discussion are eligible to earn 1 continuing education (CE) credit by answering specific questions.

It also means that we embark on research and innovations to generate new knowledge and disseminate it to the community. Research Magnet Source of Evidence: NK1EO The organization supports the advancement of nursing research. Provide one completed IRB -approved nursing research study. \"The effects of an educational intervention based on visual cues and a 'buddy system' on the incidence and prevalence of pressure ulcers\". EMPIRICAL OUTCOMES Empirical Outcomes (EO) are the barometers of excellence. They answer the question \"How do we know we provide excellent care?\" It is by looking at our outcomes data such as nurse -sensitive indicators (NSI), core measures, customer and staff satisfaction results and evaluating how we stack up against national bench- marks. This component is interwoven into the first 4 components as Sources of Evidence.
