She's helped me with many chronic issues. Not only is she experienced, she's kind and understanding. I have had several functional medicine/naturopathic doctors, but none have addressed all of my issues in the way she does. I suffer from a thyroid condition that was caused by severe food allergies as a child. Not only are we healing my gut collectively, she's helping me address my blood pressure issues as well. I finally feel that I have regained my health. Oh, most importantly, she's been the only provider who has successfully helped me get rid of eczema. Thank you Dr. Levy! Forever grateful for you! - 7/15/2022 Dr Levy and her office have been so supportive of me. I've suffered from various digestive maladies and she is getting me back on track one step at a time. I'm so grateful to have found her. - 6/20/2019 Best in the biz...good luck finding a better place for alternative medicine! - 8/20/2014 My 8 month old was acting a little cranky for a few days. He seemed in pretty good spirits, but had a little congestion and was pulling at his ear. Now, would could that mean? Teething, a cold, maybe an ear infection? I monitored his temperature and he seemed fine, so I just helped and soothed him as best I could. And then BOOM, he woke up with a rash all over his head, neck and trunk. I called Tara Natural Medicine and they were able to get us in to see Dr. Levy right away. Dr. Levy was just great! She was kind, knowledgable and helped me to understand what was going on with my little boy. She has children of her own (including a baby boy not much younger than my own), so she understood where I was coming from and helped soothe this mommas fears! We set up a plan to build back up his immune system and also discussed what nutritional needs he is beginning to have now that he is growing and consuming solids in addition to breast milk. I try to be as natural as I can be and am so glad we decided to choose going to a naturopathic doctor instead of to a medical doctor. Though medical doctors certainly serve their purpose, I just know I would have been sent home with a steroid cream or antibiotic, but instead went home with probiotics and some natural remedies, as well as other tools for my tool belt that solved the problem - and didn't create more problems in doing so! - 3/29/2017 This review is about Dr. Elizabeth Large. She wasted hours of my time and hundreds of dollars. I had a 10-minute over the phone consultation with her Jan 2nd and she asked that I undergo urine, mouth swab, and DNA testing ($200) so she could get an accurate read on my situation and we could move forward from there. She quoted me $150 for the urine and swab testing (by mail) and after payment and insurance, the testing center sent me a bill for an extra $250. I called the day before my 1st appointment to confirm all my results were in and was told they had everything. When I showed up, they didn't have half my test results and we had to rebook. 6pm the night before my next appointment, I got a phone call from Dr. Large saying she didn't have everything because I hadn't filled out a survey and hadn't sent in my results. I had sent in my results the previous week, but that email address I replied to doesn't accept replies. At 10pm I received an email requesting I fill out a survey without the link to the survey. I called the next morning and they got back to me an hour before my appointment with the link. Then I showed up and the doctor was running late, and I had another appointment to make, so I asked to reschedule. She informed me she was moving to San Rafael and would not be taking any more appointments in Oakland. After hours of my time and hundreds of dollars, I can't get in to see her because she's moving 30-minutes away by car with no public transportation nearby. Business owner information Tara L. 5/30/2017 Hi Tara. I'm so sorry you had a such a negative experience with Dr. Large. I want to clarify that Dr. Large is not actually a part of our practice, but was renting space in our office when she saw patients in the east bay. Her staff and phones are actually located in San Rafael, so the interactions you had were with her San Rafael staff and not the staff of Tara Natural Medicine. I understand your frustration and hope that you are able to work something out with Dr. Large or another local naturopathic doctor who can support you on your quest for good health. - 6/23/2011 I highly recommend Dr. Levy! At the end of last year, I was having a lot of problem with my menopause and my health. I was barely functional. The MDs didn't help (see my story below). I started seeing Dr. Tara Levy at Tara Natural Medicine in Lafayette in February of 2011. On my first visit, I was asked to bring all the medicine and supplements I was taking with me. Dr. Levy spent a lot of time with me going through all my health issues and the stuff I was taking. Then on the following visit, she had a plan for me on what to take and when to take them. She also adjusted my hormone dosage (I was already using bio-identical hormone) and also to cycle them which is more close to the natural cycles of our bodies. Now, a few months later, I'm feeling so much better, stronger, and healthier. She also answers my emails when I have questions about my hormone. The staff in her office is very nice and friendly too. My insurance does not cover my visits to Dr. Levy, but prior to that, I already wasted a bunch of money and time going to other MDs and acupuncturist. Plus I lost a lot of time on billable hours on my own business. Her office visits are reasonably priced. She also orders the bio-identical hormones for me through Women's International Pharmacy which offers hormone at such reasonable prices; much cheaper than local compounding pharmacies. Prior to Dr. Levy, I went through three really bad MDs - The first one told me to tough it out. The second one refused to put me on a balanced bio-identical hormone replacement treatment and would only give me Prometrium (an oral form of progesterone). Then he kept increasing my progesterone dosage which made me dizzy for months. The third one claimed himself the number one hormone replacement doctor in the Bay Area overdosed me so much (4 times the dosage I'm on now) that my body was in shock. He gave me even more dosage of Prometrium than the last doctor and I was so dizzy that I had to go lie down in the middle of the day. He also put me on so much testosterone that I started to break out with pimples on my face and scalp (typical symptoms of testosterone overdose). So, thanks to Dr. Levy. I'm finally back on track with my life. - 3/20/2013 I first saw Dr. Levy for a variety of nebulous health issues that felt like chronic fatigue, narcolepsy, and hypo-glycemia all rolled into one. My situation seemed to grow worse with every passing year, until I sat down with Dr. Levy. She spent an hour interviewing me about everything that was bothering me about my health, ran a series of lab tests, and followed up by prescribing a difficult but doable, clear-cut diet modification for about 6-8 weeks (candida cleanse). My symptoms have almost completely cleared up, and my energy and mental clarity is better now than it has been for at least 15 years. Dr. Levy's gift lies in her dedication to constant research and learning, care for her clients' wellbeing, and truly personable bedside manner. She'll be my primary care doctor for a long time to come! Tara Natural Medicine also has got an incredible team of doctors who work with diverse populations. The clients I have referred there (from my Pilates business) have also made some key discoveries to their health that were missing for many years. The client services has so far been excellent, down-to-earth, and attentive. Tara Natural medicine is well worth it, and the best place to find well-researched and experienced practitioners who can work with western medicine and natural medicine. Their approach to medicine will keep you truly well, rather than brushing you off or treating your symptoms. - 6/14/2013 I was told about Dr. Levy by my chiropractor who had a patient that raved about her, and now I see why. She is exceptional. When I first came to her, I was very sick. But with her help and guidance, I'm well on my way to being healthy. Dr. Levy took the time to not only go over my most recent lab results, but looked in depth at my full history of lab results. She took the time to listen, explain, and discuss. That's the thing, she took the time; whether you are scheduled for a half hour appointment or a full hour, she takes the time (and then some) to make sure everything is covered. I feel at ease talking with Dr. Levy about anything and everything. Whatever issue or concern I'm dealing with, she always has something for me, which usually works; but if it doesn't, she has alternatives. The waiting room is pleasant and the staff is warm and friendly. I'm so glad Dr. Levy has an office in Lafayette, but even if she only had an office in Berkeley, I would drive there to see her. - 5/5/2010First to Review If you have the financial means to do so,Dr. Elizabeth Large is a very good ND in my opinion. She listens,REALLY listens & tries to work with you based on your personal health issues & she covers all bases of your health including your diet/nutrition. She doesn't skip anything. Receptionist Gabrielle also is friendly & professional with patients which is helpful & you don't mind waiting if doctor is running a little late as the time she sets aside for you is worth it. The only draw back is that she doesn't accept insurance & with this economy...sigh it sucks as I feel she's been more insightful and helpful to me than all the GP I've been too since living out here since 2007. - 1/30/2014 Too bad there isn't 6 stars. I have been blessed to work with Dr. Elizabeth Large for years. She helped someone I knew with depression. We use the term \"life save\" so glibly these days. She is . She is the answer to the AMA and it's prescription pad care. I have recommended her and naturopathic medicine for years. This isn't one visit where I got good results, I have seen her be effective for over 5 years. Consider Other Options [read "}
