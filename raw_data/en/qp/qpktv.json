Email: pereira@iastate.eduAbstract In two experimental studies, we tested the effect of COVID 19 vaccine scarcity on vaccine hesitancy. Based on extensive scarcity literature, we initially predicted thathigh (vs. low) scarcity would increase demand for vaccines, operationalized as one's willingness to receive a vaccine. Contrary to this prediction, Study 1 showed that scarcity of vaccines reduced participants 'sense of priority which, in turn, also reduced their vaccination intentions. Trust in doctors moderated the effect of perceived vaccination priority on vaccination intentions such that for individuals with high trust in doctors, reduced perceived priority did not reduce their vaccination intentions as much. Study 2 replicated these effects with a more general population sample, whichincluded at risk individuals for COVID 19 complications. At risk participants (vs. low risk) had higher perceived vaccination priority, but describing vaccine doses as scarce reduced vaccination intentions similarly across both groups. Moreover, Study 2 demonstrated that compassion for others is a boundary condition of the effect of vaccine scarcity on vaccination intentions. For participants with highcompassion, scarcity reduces willingness to receive a vaccine; for participants with low compassion, scarcity increases their willingness to be vaccinated. Our results suggest that health policymakers need to deemphasize the scarcity of vaccines to increase vaccine acceptance.

It has impacted numerous important issuesfor marketers and policymakers, including \u2014but not limitedto\u2014healthcare access and utilization, the efficacy of public health campaigns, and economic activity, as many consumers forwentinperson shopping (Das et al., 2021 ). While behavioral measures were effective short term fixes to slow the virus, the distribution of effective vaccines emerged asthe only long term solution to curb the pandemic ).

Psychology & Marketing published by Wiley Periodicals LLC However, even with the unprecedentedly fast development, COVID 19 vaccines doses are still insufficient to meet global demand and will be so for the foreseeable future (Torjesen, 2021 ), as experts estimate 12 billion doses are needed to achieve population immunity (CEPI, 2020 ;K i me ta l . , 2021 ). Consequently, health officials wo rldwide are making difficult but necessary decisions about who m to vaccinate first (Williams et al., 2021 ), both globally (Liu et al., 2020 ) and locally (Persad et al., 2020 ). Prioritization and scarcity of doses may affect how people perceive these vaccines, with significant consequences for vaccine acceptance. This study aims to investigate the effect of vaccine scarcity on one's willingness to receive a vaccine. Because vaccine acceptance is ultimately an individual's choice, understanding hesitancy is im- perative for successful vaccination campaigns. Our work contributesto improving public health policy communications by leveraging and adapting our existing knowledge in behavioral theories to the unique characteristics of the current pandemic. We expect our findings toaid policymakers in this pandemic and beyond, as vaccine hesitancy is a perplexing and growing issue worldwide (WHO, 2019 ). In two experiments, we show that the predictions from extant marketing literature (i.e., that product and resource scarcity increasedemand) do not apply in this context . Instead, scarcity reduced will- ingness to receive a vaccine becaus e it lowered people's perceived priority of receiving the vaccine \u2014that is, one's urgency or importance to undergo this medical intervention. M oreover, because individuals seek the expertise of their doctors when making personal health decisions, high trust in doctors can counteract the detrimental effects of lowperceived priority when deciding whether to be vaccinated. Conversely, our second experiment reveals that scarcity of vac- cine doses may dissuade compassionate individuals from acceptingthe vaccine. This illustrates how scarcity can have disparate impactson acceptance depending on personal predispositions, adding to the scant but growing literature showing the interplay between scarcity and individual differences (Das et al., 2018 ; Kraus & Callaghan, 2016 ; Ku et al., 2012 ; Piff et al., 2010 ; Roux et al., 2015 ). Some of these findings indicate that resource (e.g., monetary) scarcity can increase prosociality (see Elbaek et al. [ 2021 ] for a review). We contribute to this literature by looking at the interplay between product scarcity and prosociality, which has not been addressed extensively. Indeed, when COVID 19 vaccines are presented as scarce, compassion for more vulnerable individuals can discourage some from accepting the vaccine for themselves because they believe others need it more. 2|THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 2.1 |Scarcity Consumers face scarcity when they have restricted access to or lack the products or resources necessary to meet their needs and desires(Hamilton et al., 2019 ). Consumers can experience two main types of scarcity: (i) product scarcity (i.e., l ack of access to goods or services forpurchase, whether at the individual product level or at the category level), and (ii) resource scarcity (i.e., lack of financial means or timenecessary to acquire desired products; Hamilton et al., 2019 ). Moreover, p r o d u c ta n dr e s o u r c es c a r c i t yc a nm a n i f e s ta tt h em i c r o level, macro level, or both, affecting individuals, groups of consumers, or whole geographical areas (Cannon et al., 2019 ;H a m i l t o ne ta l . , 2019 ). Product scarcity can occur in the marketplace due to increased de- mand, reduced supply, or both. For example, during the pandemic, manyconsumer goods such as toilet pap er became scarce due to higher demand, even though supply was fa irly undisrupted (Kirk & Rifkin, 2020 ). Other goods, such as video game consoles, experienced both increased demand, as individuals were forced to stay home during the lockdown,and reduced availability due to supply chain issues (Schreier, 2020 ). Sometimes, companies use scarcity to generate more interest and higher willingness to pay for limited products (i.e., product/marketing scarcity; Roy & Sharma, 2015 ), a common strategy for luxury goods. When consumers experience product scarcity (e.g., stockouts, limited availability), the demand for the scarceproduct increases (Lynn, 1991 ). Contrary to our video game example, several product and service categories are considered necessities. Therefore, an abundant supply ofthese goods is required for societal well being. One such category is health services and products, includ ing vaccines. Unfortunately, due to limited production capacity or supply chain disruptions, essential products can at times be insufficient to meet demand. This was thecase, for example, in the US flu vaccine shortage of 2004 -2005 (Hinman et al., 2006 ). Presently, the world faces a critical COVID 19 v a c c i n es h o r t a g e( M i n o j a , 2021 ). Therefore, an important and timely question is whether the scarcity of this essential health product can affect individuals 'attitudes towards and demand for vaccines. Much of the literature would suggest that scarcity of products (e.g., Inman et al., 1997 ;L y n n , 1991 ; van Herpen et al., 2009 )a n ds c a r c i t y of resources (e.g., Cannon et al., 2019 ; Sharma & Alter, 2012 )i n c r e a s e consumer demand. Several characteri s t i c so fs c a r c eg o o d st h a ti n c r e a s e demand apply directly to vaccines: they are manufactured by few com-panies and supply is limited. However , vaccines are traditionally sourced and distributed by governments, healthcare providers, the World Health Organization, or other multilateral organizations that control access(gatekeepers). Gatekeepers directly control access to a resource, deciding who can or should get the resource. In healthcare systems, gatekeepers are individuals, institutions, or sy stems that determine who access care and under what conditions (Sripa et al., 2019 ; Vedsted & Olesen, 2011 ). The individual is not in a position to decide without first going through the gatekeeper. Thus, by the nature of t he power dynamic, one transfers decision making responsibility to the gatekeeper. Therefore, in a vacci- nation context, public demand will also be contingent on access and not only on personal needs. Having a gatek eeper may diminish an individual's sense of personal responsibility for vaccination, reducing vaccinationintentions. Interestingly, a study conducted during the 2005 flu vaccine shortage \u2014that is, a context of vaccine scarcity \u2014reported decreased de- mand for 24% of surveyed respondents, compared with increased de- mand for only 3% of respondents (Brewer & Hallman, 2006 ). Yet, to the922 | PEREIRA ET 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License best of our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence showing contexts in which product scarcity decreases demand. Importantly,behavioral researchers recently suggested that policymakers leverage the scarcity of vaccine doses to increase COVID 19 vaccination rates (Wood & Schulman, 2021 ). However, if scarcity has the opposite effect on demand in this context, public he alth campaigns should deemphasize scarcity. 2.2 |Vaccine hesitancy The issue of restricted access to vaccines due to shortages is compounded by vaccine hesitancy, \"an attitudinal continuum, capturing doubts regarding the s afety, efficacy, necessity and general advisability of vaccination for oneself and one's family \" (Browne, 2018 , p. 2540). Hesitancy is a multifactorial and com- plex phenomenon (Salmon et al., 2015 )t h a tv a r i e sa c r o s si n - dividuals, groups, contexts, and specific vaccines (Larson et al., 2014 ). It invariably contributes to delaying or refusing available vaccines (MacDonald, 2015 ), decreasing population level vaccine uptake (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2013 ; G\u00f6tz et al., 2021 ). Vac- cine hesitancy is on the rise, and the World Health Organizationhas declared it one of the ten major global health threats (WHO, 2019 ), as it increases the risk of outbreaks and epidemics of vaccine preventable diseases (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2013 ). Although often used interchangea bly, hesitancy differs from vac- cine skepticism, which involves distrust in vaccines in general (Browne et al., 2015 ; Peretti Watel et al., 2015 ). Those hesitant demonstrate different attitudes, cognitions, and behaviors than \"antivaxxers \"(around 5% of the population; Leask et al., 2012 ) and often still accept vacci- nations, albeit sometimes on a delayed schedule (Benin et al., 2006 ). For COVID 19 vaccines, a large portion of the population is taking a \"wait and see \"approach (Hamel et al., 2020 ; Lazarus et al., 2021 ). While different from refusal, delaying vaccination nevertheless has the same short term negative impact on population immunity. Compared with other vaccines, vaccine hesitancy toward COVID 19 is high (Hamel et al., 2020 ). A multi country study revealed that 45.1% of responde nts showed different levels of hesitancy (Lazarus et al., 2021 ). Although COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy might be decreasing, a substantial proportion of the population still experiences it (Buttenheim, 2020 ), and hesitancy may undermine efforts to curb the spread of COVID 19 and re- turn to a full functioning society. Individuals who are hesitant about the COVID 19 vaccine express general vaccine hesitancy concerns, such as opposition to pharmaceutical companies, andCOVID 19 vaccine specific concerns, such as short development time (Chaney & Lee, 2021 ). Nonetheless, vaccine acceptance is the only viable pathway to exit the pandemic (Bartschet al., 2020 ), especially since eradicating the virus is seen as increasingly unlikely (Mandavilli, 2021 ). Hesitancy creates a paradoxical situation for policymakers: while vaccines are increasingly available (at least in countries that secured a larger supply of doses), individuals still need to accept them (as, atthis point, vaccine mandates and other stronger measures such as vaccine passports only affect a small part of the world population).Given the importance of getting individuals to accept the vaccine, we explore the effect of scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine via perceived priority to the self, considering three potential moderators:trust in healthcare providers, objective medical risk, and compassion. 2.3 |Perceived priority In this pandemic, priority has at least two potential meanings: who gets access to vaccines and individuals 'perceived urgency or im- portance of being vaccinated. Public health decisions have focused on the first definition (e.g., US states developed their own priority lists, starting with healthcare workers and seniors; CDC, 2021 ). We focus instead on the second definition of priority, which pertains to individuals 'own assessment of priority: a \"sense of urgency \"or in- terest in self care (Barron, 1980 ; Lacy et al., 2004 ; Mitchell & Selmes, 2007 ). The sense of the importance of medical interventions for oneself is core to patient health priorities (Wensing et al., 1998 ) and the health belief model literature (Rosenstock, 1974 ). Notably, the perceived importance of expected health intervention outcomesdrives adherence to recommended behaviors (Orji et al., 2012 ). We thus define the perceived priority of COVID 19 vaccination as the individual's internal sense of the importance of getting thevaccine for oneself, which ultimately drives one's vaccine acceptance. Scarcity may decrease priority because it injects a sense of compli- cation into the medical decision making process (Bayu et al., 2016 ). For preventative care, even relatively minor inconveniences can cause patients to delay care, essentially moving the health care ser- vice further down their to do list. Moreover, individuals do not have to directly experience complications or inconveniences to changetheir sense of priority regarding the health intervention. For example, patients may reschedule or indefinitely postpone appointments if they learn that the doctor's office has a long wait time (i.e., scarcity ofdoctor's availability; Green et al., 2014 ). Scarcity may impact an in- dividual's perceived priority even more, as vaccine benefits do not accrue only to the individual but also to the community. Nevertheless, if priority is low, individuals may still follow medical guidance if a convenient opportunity arises. For this reason, vacci- nations have been conducted in nonclinical locations. For example,Maryland's GoVax campaign offered shots at a seaside bar, in- corporating a health intervention into a previously planned activity \u2014a trip to the beach (Heim, 2021 ). By meeting people at a convenient place and time with an abundance of vaccines, the barrier of lowperceived priority can be overcome. Hence, priority for oneself is related to but distinct from the willingness to accept a medical intervention, such as vaccination.Consider a person who believes receiving a COVID 19 vaccine is a high priority for their health. This person may still experience barriers to receiving the vaccine, such as an inability to find transportation tothe vaccine site, decreasing their willingness to be vaccinated. Thus, while perceived priority of vaccine to the self is a precursor ofPEREIRA ET AL. |923 15206793, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License willingness to receive a vaccine, other factors are important drivers of vaccine acceptance, including trust in healthcare providers, medicalrisk, and compassion for others more vulnerable to the disease. 2.4 |Factors influencing vaccine acceptance: Trust, risk, and compassion Trust in healthcare providers improves several health outcomes, in- cluding adherence to prescribed treatments and continuity of care (Dugan et al., 2005 ), perceived communication quality (Finkelstein et al., 2020 ), and patients 'attitudes toward and acceptance of vaccines (Benin et al., 2006 ; Casiday et al., 2006 ). Moreover, trust in institutions is vital for successful crisis responses (Cairney & Wellstead, 2021 ). Such trust can drive the acceptance of interventions that respond to a pre-sent emergency, including vaccine acceptance (Unicef, 2020 ). From a public health standpoint, the importance of trust in doctors for medical care and treatment outcomes emanates fromparticularities of healthcare ser vices: they are a credence good, whose quality patients cannot fully evaluate due to lack of expertise (Darby & Karni, 1973 ). Therefore, patients who trust their doctors are willing to fo llow their advice even when the underlying reasoning is not fully understood. Conversely, patients who do not trust doctors are more likely to delay preventative care (Musa et al., 2009 ). Medical risk also impacts vaccine prioritization and accep- tance. Seniors or those with chronic health conditions (e.g., lung diseases, diabetes, cancer; CDC, 2020 ) are more at risk of devel- oping severe COVID 19. Higher medical or perceived risk increases individuals 'likelihood to engage in actions that reduce their risk, including the accept ance of vaccinations (Caserotti et al., 2021 ). Past health problems and ongoing chronic conditions can increase individuals 'vigilance to health related threats (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020 ). Living with an underlying health condition changes how in- dividuals view the world and perceive danger, especially in the con- text of healthcare, where stressors and health concerns take on even more importance (Park, 2010 ). Therefore, framing the COVID 19 vaccines as a scarce resource may be an effective communication strategy to increase perceived vaccination priority to the self and willingness to receive a vaccine among people with high risk for se-vere COVID 19, while it may decrease the priority and willingness to receive a vaccine among those at lower risk. In the context of vaccinations, individuals may be compassionate and consider the benefits to the broader community, not only tothemselves. Compassion is the ability to understand or be aware of the suffering of others and the need to act to end that suffering (Crawford et al., 2013 ; Von Dietze & Orb, 2000 ), and is a common foundation for cooperation in communities (Gintis, 2000 ). It moti- vates individuals to behave altruistically (Henrich, 2004 ) toward specific individuals and more abstract others (Neff & Pommier, 2013 ). Therefore, compassion for others is a predictor of adherence to many prosocial behaviors, including vaccinations (Bodelet et al., 2020 ).But if vaccines are scarce, individuals with compassion for others vulnerable to the disease may have a lower willingness to receive avaccine, because accepting the vaccine may make them believe that someone more deserving does not get access. Indeed, previous re- search has shown that individuals engage in more selfish behaviors when they are reminded of resource scarcity (vs. abundance), but this resource scarcity effect is not observed among individuals with more prosocial tendencies (Roux et al., 2015 ). In addition, if individuals can use prosocial behaviors as status signals, then resource scarcity alsopromotes prosocial behavior (Kraus & Callaghan, 2016 ; Roux et al., 2015 ). A similar sentiment in the context of scarce COVID 19 vaccines may also cause individuals to think of others and determine that \"others need it more \"\u2014either because other individuals are sick or sicker than themselves or because these individuals are not able tostay home to avoid the virus (Appiah, 2021 ). These reports suggest that product scarcity can also make people act more prosocially, a possibility that was not directly addressed in the scarcity literature.Importantly, compassion for others should not change the effect of scarcity on the perceived priority of the vaccine to the self, that is, compassion does not make one feel that the vaccine is less importantto them, but instead that it is more important for others. We nextsummarize our research hypotheses and provide an overview of our empirical approach. 3|OVERVIEW OF HYPOTHESES AND STUDIES In two experiments, we tested the effect of vaccine scarcity on one's perceived priority and willingness to receive a vaccine. Study 1 wasconducted with a student sample, while Study 2 was conducted witha more general adult population, specifically sampled to vary in health risk (i.e., presence vs. absence of a pre existing medical condition). Sample characteristic details and means of dependent measures bycondition are available in the Supporting Information (Tables S1 andS2). The extant literature on marketing and psychology mainly fo- cused on the effects of resource scarcity (e.g., financial means, usually incidental or unrelated to the consumption domain being in- vestigated) or product scarcity (i.e., the effects of scarcity of specificproducts or product categories and its integral effects on related consumption). Here, we specifically considered the effect of vaccine scarcity (i.e., integral, product scarcity) on vaccination acceptance.Following most of the findings from the scarcity literature, weoriginally predicted that vaccine scarcity would increase product demand, namely one's willingness to receive a vaccine. We pre registered Study 1 initial hypothesis, protocols, and analyses plan ( https://osf.io/fmbd6?view_only=fedb46dc45144f12b45157e 324b1309e ). As Study 1 results were opposite to our prediction, we revised our theorizing and developed a new set of hypothesesthat we pre registered and tested in Study 2 ( https://osf.io/4gsda? view_only=75236c2e76294db994641ea526598b22 ). We predicted924 from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License that scarcity of COVID 19 vaccines would decrease willingness to receive a vaccine due to a decrease in one's perception of priority inreceiving the vaccine. Stated formally: H1:Vaccine scarcity reduces perceived priority and willingness to receive a vaccine. Additionally, we predicted that participants 'trust in doctors (Studies 1 -2) would moderate the effect of priority on will- ingness, and health risk would moderate the effect of scarcity on priority (Study 2). Thus: H2:The effect of perceived priority on willingness to receive a vaccine is moderated by trust in doctors, such that it is smaller for participants who trust doctors more. H3:High (vs. low) medical risk increases (decreases) perceived priority when vaccines scarcity is high (vs. low). We also expected (see exploratory items on pre registration) that other factors could impact the effect of scarcity on will-ingness to receive a vaccine, including altruistic feelings such ascompassion for those most vulnerable to COVID 19 (Study 2). Because altruistic individuals may feel compassionate towards others more vulnerable to COVID 19, they may have a lower willingness to receive a vaccine in conditions of vaccine scarcity, so that more deserving others c an be vaccinated first. Thus: H4: High (low) compassion for others decreases (increases) willingness to receive a vaccine when vaccines are scarce. 4|STUDY 1 4.1 |Methods Participants (17 revoked consent, final N= 342 U.S. students, Mage= 20.6, SDage= 1.65, 52% female, see MDA Table S1) completed the study between October 5 -16, 2020, when no COVID 19 vac- cines were yet available to the public. This study employed a 2 (scarcity: high vs. low) between subjects design. Participants read the following scenario (high scarcity condi- tion is bracketed): \"Imagine that a vaccine for COVID 19 was approved for distribution within the population. Vaccine manu- facturers were working around the clock to produce enough vials so that everyone can be vaccinated now [as soon as possible, but there are still not enough vaccines for everyone] . Your area has plenty of places offering vac- cines for all individuals who want to get it now. [Your area has very few places offering vaccines at this point, and priority has been given to at risk groups.] You just receiveda notification from your doctor that their clinic can finally offer you the vaccine next week. You need to decidenow if you will call and book the appointment. \" We then measured participants 'willingness to receive a vaccine (\"How likely are you to be vaccinated? \",f r o m0= Highly unlikely to 100 = Highly likely ), their perceived priority to receive the vaccine ( \"How much of a priority would it be for you to get the vaccine? \",f r o m0= N o ta ta l la priority to 100 = High priority ), how risky they considered the vaccine to be (from 0 = Not risky at all to 100 = Highly risky ), and the expected protection conferred by the vaccine (from 0 = N o tp r o t e c t i v ea ta l l to 100 = Highly protective ). Participants completed a 7 item trust in health- care providers scale (responses from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly agree ,= 0.82, sample item: \"Doctors are extremely thorough and care- ful,\"Dugan et al., 2005 ), and a vaccine skepticism measure ( \"Ia ms k e p t i c a l about vaccines in general, \"from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly agree ). Participants reported demograp hic information, subjective risk perceptions, political orientation, a nd adherence to prevention behaviors (full questionnaire available i n the Supporting Information). 4.2 |Results A MANOVA revealed that scarcity did not affect perceived risk or pro- tection associated with the vaccine ( Fs<1 ) ,b u t \u2014contrary to our original expectations \u2014it reduced participants 'willingness to receive a 0.024) and the perceived priority 3 ) .

Because general vaccine skepticism relates to a more stable individual attitude toward vaccines (Browne, 2018 ), we in- cluded it as a covariate (the coefficients and full model do not changesignificantly without the inclusion of this covariate, see Supporting Information for the results without the covariate). Scarcity (contrast coded: 0.5 = Low, +0.5 = High) reduced perceived priority to be p< 0.001), while perceived priority increased willingness to receive a vaccine ( =0 . 7 23.59, p<0 . 0 0 1 ; s e e T a b l e 1and H1). Trust in doctors sig- nificantly predicted willingness to vaccine ( ET 15206793, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023].

Theconditional indirect effect of scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine via priority was strongest in those with low trust in doctors (=11.61, SE=2 . 8 4 , 9 5 % C I= 17.3274, 6.1237) and weakest in t h o s ew i t hh i g ht r u s ti nd o c t o r s( =8.78, SE= 2.22, 95% CI = 13.3739, 4.5581, see Figure 2and H2). This means that scarcity reduced one's priority and, subsequently, willing ness to receive a vaccine more amongthose with low trust in doctors than those with high trust in doctors. Theconditional direct effect of scarcity on willingness was not significant in the full model ( t< 1). The simple mediation model is also significant (see Supporting Information). 4.3 |Discussion Study 1 showed that framing COVID 19 vaccines as scarce de- creases perceived priority and, consequently, willingness to FIGURE 1 Effect of vaccine scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine, mediated by perceived priority to the self and moderated by trust in doctors (Study 1) TABLE 1 Study 1 Conditional Mediation Model -Unstandardized OLS regression coefficients with confidence intervals (standard errors in parentheses) estimating perceived priority to the self and willingness to receive a vaccine.

For participants with high trust in doctors, the in-creased trust may have \"inoculated \"them from the harmful effect of low perceived priority on willingness to receive a vaccine, making them more prone to follow their doctor's recommenda-tion from the scenario even in the high vaccine scarcity condition. These findings contradict predictions from extant literature on the effects of scarcity on demand for goods. Nevertheless, Study 1 presents two main weaknesses. First, we re- lied on a relatively homogeneous student sample with a likely low risk of developing severe COVID 19 complications (Dowd et al., 2020 ). Second, we had originally hypothesized that vaccine scarcity would increase willingness to receive a vaccine rather than decrease it. Given the im- portance of COVID 19 vaccination efforts and the widespread sense of scarcity associated with the vaccines, we ran Study 2 to replicate Study 1results within a broader population, thus addressing these weaknesses. 5|STUDY 2 We hypothesized that the negative effect of scarcity on perceived priority could be reduced if participants had increased objective risks of experi- encing severe COVID 19. Moreover, we sought to replicate our results in a situation where hesitancy was not di rected towards hypothetical vac- cines but towards vaccines already given emergency use authorization bythe relevant governmental authorities and available to the general public. 5.1 |Methods We advertised 300 Prolific Academic slots for US participants who previously stated that they had been diagnosed with chronic diseases (e.g., heart or lung diseases, stroke, etc.) and 300 slots for those whodid not declare having such diagnosis (590 completed the study, five participants revoked consent, final N= 585, 52.5% female, Mage= 40.23, SDage= 14.20, see MDA Table S1). We restricted our study to participants who had not received a COVID 19 vaccine and had not contracted COVID 19. This study employed a 2 (scarcity: high vs. low) \u00d7 2 (risk: high vs. low) between subjects design. Scenarios were adapted from Study 1, adding information about the two vaccines against COVID 19 (Pfi- zer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIAID) licensed in the United States at the time of the data collection (January 27 to February 10, 2021; see Supporting Information for questionnaire). We measured compassionwith others with a single item 7 point rating scale ( \"How much compassion do you feel for those most vulnerable to COVID 19?\", from 1 = Not at all to 7 = A great deal ). 5.2 |Results A MANOVA revealed that scarcity reduced willingness to receive av a c c i n e( F(583) = 4.62, p=0 . 0 3 2 , p2= 0.008): participants in the high (vs. low) scarcity condition displayed a lower willingness(M= 71.72, SD= 37.58 3 . 5 5 , r e s p e c t i v e l y ) . The effect of scarcity on perceived priority did not reach the standard level of statistical significance (High: M= scarcity d i dn o ti m p a c tp e r c e i v e dv a c c i n e protection and risk ( ps > 0.15). 5.2.1 |Study 1 replication A moderated mediation model on the effect of scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine via priority, moderated by trust in doctors andFIGURE 2 Willingness to receive a vaccine at different levels of perceived priority to the self bytrust in doctors (Study 1)PEREIRA ET AL. |927 15206793, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023].

Scarcity (contrast coded: 0.5 = Low, +0.5 = High) significantly reduced perceived priority to receive a vaccine (=6.65, SE=2 . 6 3 , t(582) = 2.53, p= 0 . 0 1 2 ) ,w h i c hi nt u r ni n c r e a s e d willingness to receive a vaccine ( =0 . increased willingness ( =8 p<0 . 0 0 1 ) a n d m o d e r a t e d the effect of priority on willingness ( =0.08, 0.001; H2 is supported).

The interaction between scarcity and trust in doctors was not a significant predictor of willingness ( t<1 ) .H o w e v e r ,i n this sample, the conditional direct effect of scarcity on willingness to re- ceive a vaccine was significant for those high in trust in doctors(=3.35, SE= 1.69, 95% CI = 6.6778, 0.0313), but not significant for those low in trust in doctors ( =1.80, SE=1 . 8 0 , 9 5 % C I= 5.3473, 1.7398). Therefore, higher levels of trust in doctors corresponded to areduced detrimental effect of vaccin e scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine. The simple mediation model is also significant (see Supporting Information). 5.2.2 |Objective risk We hypothesized that risk (contrast coded: 0.5 = Low risk, +0.5 = High risk) would moderate the effect of scarcity on perceived priority: forparticipants at higher risk to develop severe COVID 19, scarcity would not induce lower perceived priority. However, hypothesis 3 was notsupported: neither the moderated mediation with risk as the moderator in the first stage (model 8) nor the moderated moderated mediation (model 29, with trust in doctors as the moderator for the second stage)were significant. As expected, participants from the high risk group had higher perceived priority to receive the vaccine ( M= 76.08, SD= 34.88) than former also had a margin ally higher willingness to receive av a c c i n e( M= 77.69, 1.87, p= 0.06). However, the interaction between scarcity and risk was not a significant predictor of perceived priority or willingness toreceive a vaccine (both ts < 1). Therefore, even though the risk was a significant predictor of perceived pri ority, risk level did not significantly impact the effect of vaccine scarcity on priority. 5.2.3 |Compassion We anticipated that altruistic motives (here, compassion for t h o s em o s tv u l n e r a b l et oC O V I D 19) would also explain the ef- fect of scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine via priority,controlling for skepticism. The moderated mediation was sig- nificant is supported, see Figure 5and Table 3for full results). The interaction between compassion and vaccine scarcity was sig- nificant ( p< 0.01). For participants with high compassion (top 48.4% of the distribution), scarcity reduced their willingness to receive a vaccine. For participants with low FIGURE 3 Effect of vaccine scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine, mediated by perceived priority to the self and moderated by trust in doctors (Study 2)928 | PEREIRA ET AL. 15206793, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023].

With two studies showing a similar, albeit counter intuitive pattern of results, it is unlikely that our observation is due tochance. Even so, Study 2 failed to establish risk as a statistically significant moderator of the effect of scarcity on perceived priority to the self. We expected that those at higher risk of developing severeCOVID 19 would consider vaccination a priority even when faced with scarcity of COVID 19 vaccines. This surprising result may bebecause risk estimates are subjective and malleable, especially risk perceptions regarding vulnerability to an uncertain but negative health outcome (Menon et al., 2002 ; Murdock & Rajagopal, 2017 ). Nevertheless, Study 2 revealed that vaccine scarcity might affect an individual's vaccination acceptance by multiple mechanisms. For highly compassionate individuals with equal levels of perceived prior- ity, scarcity reduces their willingness to receive a vaccine. But scarcityalso reduces one's perceived priority to the self, subsequently de-creasing willingness; this detrimental effect can be counteracted by high trust in doctors. Thus, increasing one's trust in doctors may be an important lever for improving willingness to receive a vaccine evenwhen individuals feel that COVID 19 vaccination is less of a priority for themselves. In summary, increasing the availability of vaccines or at least decreasing the perception that vaccines are scarce should be thefocus of vaccination campaigns, given that scarcity, in this context, reduces willingness to receive a vaccine.TABLE 2 Study 2 Conditional Mediation Model -Unstandardized OLS regression coefficients with confidence intervals (standard errors in parentheses) estimating perceived priority to the self and willingness to receive a vaccine.

This difference in vaccine acceptance could sig- nificantly impact our ability to reach population immunity for the current pandemic. If population immunity is out of reach, as manyhave suggested (Mandavilli, 2021 ), incremental vaccine acceptance is even more critical as each vaccinated person disrupts the chain of viral transmission. Accordingly, our findings are significant for bothacademic research and policymakers.The practical implications of the current research are clear: to promote COVID 19 vaccine acceptance, policymakers and healthcare providers should not highlight the scarcity of vaccine doses. For booster shots, which healthcare regulatory agencies in severalcountries presently recommend (as of October 2021), perceivedscarcity may polarize individual preferences (Zhu & Ratner, 2015 ). Polarized preferences could result in individuals waiting to be able to implement their preferred vaccination strategy (e.g., specific brandpreference, preference for mRNAs, preference for mixing and matching, etc.). Deemphasizing scarcity can also prevent complicating the distribution of boosters and increase vaccine acceptance ingeneral. This recommendation contradicts not only the general FIGURE 5 Effect of vaccine scarcity on willingness to receive a vaccine, mediated by perceived priority to the self and moderated by compassion for the vulnerable (Study 2) TABLE 3 Study 2 Conditional Mediation Model -Unstandardized OLS regression coefficients with confidence intervals (standard errors in parentheses) estimating perceived priority to the self and willingness to receive a vaccine.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License findings from the scarcity literature, but also a suggestion from a recent article in a major health journal proposing to leverage natural scarcity to encourage COVID 19 vaccine acceptance (see Table 1 \"Strategies for Promoting Covid 19 vaccination, \"in Wood and Schulman [ 2021 ]). Our findings underscore the pitfalls of assuming that scarcity will have the same result on demand regardless ofcontext. Accordingly, to better understand how scarcity impacts vacci- nation intentions, we conducted an additional study ( N= 243, student sample). In this study, we used an incidental (i.e., unrelated to thedecision task) manipulation of resource scarcity (Roux et al., 2015 ) instead of an integral manipulation of COVID 19 vaccine scarcity (i.e., product scarcity). A general resource scarcity frame did not influenceperceived priority or willingness to receive a vaccine (both ts > 1). This suggests that chronic resource scarcity (e.g., poverty) or tran- sient resource scarcity unrelated to vaccines do not decrease or in-crease vaccine acceptance and perceived priority. If scarcity reduces willingness to receive a vaccine due to perceptions of lower priority to be vaccinated (our proposed mechanism), then it is intuitive thatincidental scarcity does not change willingness to receive a vaccine.Instead, it is the scarcity of vaccines per se that changes individuals ' beliefs and intended behaviors. Indeed, the vast majority of the s carcity literat ure suggests that product scarcity increases demand, to the point that con- sumers may even switch brands when they cannot access a product and a direct substitute is available (Biraglia et al., 2021 ; Das et al., 2021 ). Building on our results and the relatively meager research on boundary conditions fo r resource scarcity resulting ingenerous, not only selfish behavior (e.g., Roux et al., 2015 ), we propose that in vaccination and related contexts, the effects of product scarcity on demand will be contingent on prosocialconsiderations. In the vaccination domain, the benefits accrue not only to the individual but also to the general public. In this public health context, access to the scarce product is controlled bymedical professionals, governmental agencies, or other entities.Scarcity's deleterious effects (i.e., depletion or ineffective allo- cation of finite resources) can b e reduced by creating informal or institutionalized access rules or by having agents (i.e., gate-keepers) regulating consumption (Os\u00e9s Eraso & Viladrich Grau, 2007 ;O s t r o m , 1990 ). Individuals may be prone to conserve scarce resources for others if they are altruistic and encounter asystem that they believe to be reasonably fair, which can reduce demand for a good (e.g., COVID 19 vaccines). Notably, previous studies had considered more the effect of resource scarcity on altruistic behaviors by showing how these were moderated by both the benefits of the behavior and the costs to the self (Goldsmith et al., 2020 ; Roux et al., 2015 ). In contrast, our study considered the effect of vaccine scarcity (i.e., product scarcity) onwillingness to receive a vaccine (which has benefits for self and others). We showed that participants scoring high in compassion for others were more likely to have reduced interest in the COVID 19 vaccine. In contrast, those scoring low in compassion had a higher willingness to receive the vaccine. In addition, scarcity may also reduce one's sense of priority for receiving a vaccine due to the role gatekeepers play in the access to COVID 19 vaccinations and preventative healthcare. This diminished FIGURE 6 Willingness to receive a vaccine at different levels of compassion for the vulnerableby scarcity (Study 2)PEREIRA ET AL. |931 15206793, 2022, 5, from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License perceived responsibility can reduce vaccination intentions and per- ceived priority, as individuals may internalize that their priority \u2014 especially in the scarcity condition \u2014is being determined by an ex- ternal agent and therefore out of their control. Hence, public health campaigns should deemphasize the scarcity of healthcare services,especially those with public benefits, such as vaccinations or smoking cessation programs (Novotny & Zhao, 1999 ). Similar dynamics are expected in other domains like voting, where gatekeepers controlaccess and the individual benefits for participation are minimal, butthe public benefit from high voter turnaround is considerable (Bendor et al., 2003 ). Previous research has found a negative correlation be- tween voter turnout and the availability of polling machines(Highton, 2006 ). Paradoxically, voting rights organizations 'push for systematic change by emphasizing the lack of adequate polling places in certain neighborhoods may inadvertently depress voting turnout inthe short term. Finally, Study 2 revealed that risk, as expected, increases perceived priority to be vaccinated. That is, part icipants with a higher risk of health complications indicated that getting the COVID 19 vaccine was a higher priority than those participants with a lower risk of complications. Inter- estingly, even for this group of high risk individuals, the scarcity of COVID 19 vaccinations still decreased the perceived priority and will- ingness to be vaccinated. This could be because not even high risk in- dividuals surmise that they should have more priority when vaccines are scarce. Ultimately, these surprising results could also be because riskassessments are subjective in healt hcare contexts, depending on such f a c t o r sa sd i s t a n c et op a n d e m i ce p i c e n t e r s( L ie ta l . , 2021 ), and is even potentially malleable depending on message cues (Menon et al., 2002 ; Murdock & Rajagopal, 2017 ). Our research highlights that extra care is warranted when considering risk in a healthcare context. 6.1 |Limitations Our studies used hypothetical scenarios and were conducted when mass vaccination programs were either in the planning phase or hardly initiated. Therefore, the public had limited in- formation about the efficacy and safety of the COVID 19 vac- cines. Moreover, as vaccination rates are increasing across the world, the scarcity of COVID 19 vaccines might gain a dramati- cally different meaning compared to the one utilized in the cur-rent research. For example, various governments (e.g., U.S.) have reduced COVID 19 vaccines scarcity locally, guaranteeing the availability of vaccines in their own country by adopting lawssuch as Defense Production Act, but by doing so, they \u2014 inadvertently or not \u2014increased scarcity globally (Astor & Savage, 2021 ). As a substantial number of consumers from im- poverished countries face extreme levels of resource scarcity (Hill&M a r t i n , 2012 ), they may remain excluded from the supply of vaccines in the near future and continue to experience product (i.e., vaccine) scarcity. In both studies, vaccine scarcity was justified in two ways. Firstly, we told participants that manufacturers were working around theclock so that everyone could be vaccinated as soon as possible, al- though there were still not enough vaccines for everyone (Study 1and Study 2). Secondly, we justified scarcity by mentioning that priority was currently given to \"at risk \"(Study 1) or \"high risk \"(Study 2) groups. It is possible that the second justification, although eco-logically valid, as it was consistent with how the distribution of the COVID 19 vaccines proceeded at the time of the data collection, had impacted participants 'perceived priority and willingness to receive the vaccine. As such, it may have made participants think that theywere not (or less) at risk or made them not want to be associated with high risk groups. Given that in Study 2 health risk increased per- ceived priority to be vaccinated, this alternative explanation is un-likely because participants (1) were told that there were likely not enough vials for everyone \u2014a clear signal of vaccine scarcity, and (2) were asked to imagine they received a notification from their doctorthat their clinic can offer them a vaccine \u2014hence bypassing the judgment about their own risk or lack thereof. Another plausible explanatory mechanism of scarcity effect on willingness to receive a vaccine could be one's rational versus visceral state of mind when making such a decision. Predicting how one would behave in a future situation involves qualitatively differentcognitive and emotional processes than actually being in thatsituation, partly because people overestimate their future emotions 'intensity and duration compared to their felt emotions (Goldsmith & Dhar, 2013 ; Wilson & Gilbert, 2005 ). Moreover, when answering our questionnaire, people may have had empathy gaps (Loewenstein, 2005 ), that is, being in an affectively \"cold \"state (e.g., not feeling that vaccines are actually scarce) and therefore under-appreciating how they would feel and behave when in an affectively \"hot\"state (e.g., when vaccines are truly scarce). If the scarcity ma- nipulations we used induced participants to think that scarcity was anexperimental by product rather than a reality, their decreased will- ingness to receive a vaccine might reflect a more rational \u2014or even a socially desirable \u2014response rather than their 'natural 'response. However, if the vaccine availability was low, selfishness (e.g.,Kristofferson et al., 2017 ; Roux et al., 2015 ) or arousal (Zhu & Ratner, 2015 ) might be strong enough to override these more al- truistic intentions. However plausible, we believe that these ex-planations are unlikely because scarcity was a factual reality at the time of our data collection. Hence, our manipulation, albeit con- structed for experimental testing, merely reflected the currentsituation. 6.2 |Future research Our proposed model helps better predict the effects of scarcity on demand in different contexts, including public health. Future researchcould examine further the relationship between perceived priority and behavioral intentions. In our studies, perceived priority was an antecedent of the intended behavior (i.e., willingness to schedule avaccination), which in turn is an essential antecedent of actual be- haviors (in this case, receiving a vaccine). In addition, priority can be932 | PEREIRA ET AL. 15206793, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.21629 by <shibboleth>-member@monash.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [18/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License understood both in terms of the importance and urgency of an action (Zhu et al., 2018 ), so additional studies could explore how these two factors influence vaccination intentions. Future research should test additional reasons why scarcity re- duces the sense of priority and willingness to receive a vaccine. Forexample, different reasons such as prosociality, motivated reasoning, and feelings of powerlessness and resignation may operate simulta- neously, and individual as well as societal factors, such as collectivism(Cho et al., 2021 ), must be considered holistically. Furthermore, in Study 2, we used a one item measure for compassion for individuals in high risk groups for COVID 19. Future research on the effects of scarcity on vaccination intentions could explore different types ofcompassion, both specific to COVID 19 and more general concern for others (Batson et al., 2007 ). In addition, new research should further explore the relationship between product scarcity and in-dividual characteristics related to compassion and prosociality. Since the majority of the product scarcity research states that it increases demand for products, it will be interesting to see if compassionmoderates this effect in other contexts. Although efficacy studies of COVID 19 vaccines are proceeding expeditiously, questions regarding their development pace and long term efficacy remain. As new variants emerge, seasonal boosters maybe required. Repeated shots may impact priority and willingness to receive a vaccine, especially among individuals who already experi- enced hesitancy (both those who eventually accepted the vaccineand those who still have not; Yong, 2021 ) and among vulnerable populations. Medical providers can also increase their efforts to build trust with vulnerable patients, and consequently increase vaccineacceptance by displaying cultural competency and advocating for eliminating racial and ethnic disparities (Cook et al., 2005 ; Ngo Metzger et al., 2006 ). Notably, members of vulnerable populations in terms of health outcomes often also suffer from financial deprivation. This chronic resource scarcity means that they may have limited access to ne- cessary products for recovery (Baker, 2009 )\u2014in our context, scarce vaccines during a global pandemic. Individuals who grew up poor (i.e., who experienced chronic resource scarcity at young ages) tend to be more patient (Thompson, Hamilton, et al., 2020 ) and more accepting of substitutes in situations of product scarcity (Thompson, Banerji, et al., 2020 ). Ironically, their resilience may make them less likely to advocate for access and more likely to be dissuaded by the scarcity ofvaccines. Therefore, future research should directly address the im- pact of vaccine scarcity on the vaccine acceptance of vulnerable populations.
