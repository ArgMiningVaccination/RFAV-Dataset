Many scientists believe climate change is occurring more rapidly than predicted. In addition to natural sources of environmental change, humans are increasingly contributing to the breakdown of natural cycles on Planet Earth. Many blame the greenhouse effect for the rapidly melting polar ice caps, thawing permafrost, changing seasona weather patterns, and rising sea levels. The industrialized world uses vast amounts of energy, but consumption is also increasing dramatically in developing countries such as China and India with their populations of over one billion each. Sources of fossil fuels are finite and overuse is harmful to the environment. So how should we meet global energy needs? The search for answers has begun. But it is not just government s and scientists that need to act. Every citizen can contribute to the solution in his or her own way. 264690 003 The Fuel that Never Ends What will power our cars in the future? Will it be ecologically produced E85 bio-ethanol?

Questions are being raised time and again as to the causes of these extreme weather phenomena, which can have serious soci al and economic consequences, and as to the measures that could be applied to avert them or adapt to them. Scientists have been studying the global climatic system now for more than ten years. This has involved analysis of mankind's effect on it and looking at the possible consequences of future climate changes. Over the last few years, as a result of intensive research many answers to questions concerning fundamental mechanisms and development trends have become much clearer. 264670 003 The Riddle of Ladakh In the Himalayas scientists are searching for reasons for global climate change.

Most family businesses have overcome the challenges of globalization, without losing sight of their roots and traditions. But what makes them so special? How have they succeeded in asserting themselves on global markets? In four-to-six-minute portraits we outline key players, corporate strategies and the special relationship between the owners and their employees. We show how familial solidarity and commitment to their home regions create a unique entrepreneurial spirit.

Which explains why the GTZ, the German Organization for Technical Co-operation, has made reducing post-harvest losses one of its prime aims.

Literature's response to this tendency was the genre of \"Heimatdichtung\", or vernacular poetry. Theodor Storm's tale of \"The Little H\u00e4welmann\", and especially his famous novella \"The Rider on the White Horse\" movingly evoke the character of North Friesland's people, their ongoing battle against the sea, and their ties to the land.

Some of Lessing's works are among the most important contributions to the German Enlightenment move-ment, which was directed at humanizing national, social and cultural life. In his drama \"Nathan the Wise\", Lessing made a plea for human prejudices to give way to a spirit of humanity and tolerance. He was the most significant German writer to emerge since the time of Luther, the one great name in 18th century German literature until Goethe came on the scene.

Plans for their disposal are nowhere in sight. The confrontation over the Brent Spar got the deba te underway about what should be done with decommissioned oil platforms. Shell Oil was pressured into developing an alter-native to sending the Brent Spar to the bottom of the sea. It was towed to shore, broken up and recycled.

Evidently, he did not find the right libretti. The libretto for Fidelio was based on a French play written at the time of the Revolution and glorifying the maxim \"liberty, equality, fraternity\". Fidelio tells the story of Leonore, a devoted wife who disguises herself as a boy (Fidelio) and sets out to rescue her husband from a lingering death as the political prisoner of a powerful ruler. In securing his releas e along with all the other prisoners and bringing the tyrant to justice, her effo rts, though motivate d by love, become an act of political rebellion against the powers that be. Fidelio was first performed in Vienna in 1805.

That is to say they were written for performance during the church service on each of the three days of Christmas, on New Year's Day, on the Sunday after New Year's Day and at the Festival of Epiphany. It is not an oratorio in the usual sense of a dramatic portrayal of biblical histor y, but an account of the birth of Christ as told by the evangelist Luke, interwoven with lyrical reflections based on poetry by Picander. The Christmas Oratorio does not consist wholly of original writing by Bach: some parts of it he borrowed from older, secular works, merely providing them with new words. Nevertheless, there is no sense anywhere of a discrepancy between words and music. Bach himself united the cantatas into a single work, so there is every justification in performing them together as an oratorio.

Of his more than 50 operatic works, many are still part of the repertoire of opera companies all over the world. One of his less serious stage works is the pastoral opera \"Aci s and Galatea\", a cl assical piece based on the Roman poet Ovid. Acis the shep herd loves Galatea the nymph, but he has a rival, the one-eyed cyclops Polyphemus. Acis loses a duel with Polyphemus and dies. But Galatea's love makes Acis immortal and trans-forms him into an everlasting spring of water. The work underwent many alterations, some by Handel himself. Even Mozart, who published a number of Handel's works, re-orchestrated and enlarged the piece. 683747 Live Music, 86 min., SD, 1985; Original Version, Sung in English; WW 604005 001 Live Music, 60 min., SD, 1991; Abridged Version, Sung in English; WW MUSIC For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Rhythms that Speak Rhythms that are familiar world-wide often have their roots in social groups who found in music a way of expressing their socio-political problems and ideals.

A message is conveyed to the listener or viewer which is only comprehensible to those who have grown up in that particular culture.
