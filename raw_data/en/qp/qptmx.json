There have been impressive achievements in improved health status of populations and in universal coverage for most OECD countries. There remains, however, a recurrent concern regarding the adequacy of resources and the way they are currently used, and how best to increase the equity, efficiency and effectiveness of health care. The challenges of rapid technological change, growing patient expectations and ageing populations reinforced the appeal for further reforms. Consequently, there is a rising demand for a core set of financial data provided by National Health Accounts as well as by international comparisons of health care spending. This manual of A System of Health Accounts (SHA) provides a set of comprehensive, consistent and flexible ac- counts. It establishes a conceptual basis of statistical reporting rules and proposes a newly devel- oped International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA) which covers three dimensions: health care by functions of care; providers of health care services; and sources of funding. The proposed accounts are designed to meet the needs of analysts of health care systems and policy-makers. They provide a common framework for enhancing the comparability of data over time and across countries. They are intended for use in international comparisons that include a broad range of countries with different ways of organising health care and its financing. This manual builds on more than fifteen years of work of the OECD Secretariat on international comparisons of health care data in support of economic analysis of health policy. A number of experts in OECD countries and from other international organisations have assisted in producing this manual by commenting on various draft versions. Their contributions are gratefully acknowledged. The manual was prepared by Manfred Huber, an administrator in the Directorate for Education, Employment, Labour and Social Affairs and is published on the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD. National statistical agencies and other users of the manual may contact the SHA Hotline at sha.contact@oecd.org for questions and queries. Additional information on the SHA and further practical guidelines are available at http://www.oecd.org/els/health/sha.htm. All users of this manual are invited to take an active part in its further development.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 4ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Comments, which influenced the final round of redrafting, were provided by Jean-Pierre Poullier (WHO Geneva), who had initiated the project of the System of Health Accounts at the OECD Secretariat and commented on each draft version over the last three years. Various draft versions of the SHA were discussed with the members of the Eurostat Task Force on Health Care Statistics .

At present, National Health Accounts are at different stages of development and may not only differ in the boundaries drawn between health and other social and economic activities but also in the classifications used, the level of detail provided and in the accounting rules. The System of Health Accounts (SHA) provides a framework for a family of interrelated tables for standard reporting for expenditure on health and its financing. The SHA has been written with the dual aim of providing a framework for international data collections and as a possible model for redesigning and complementing National Health Accounts to aid policy-makers. 1.2. As a system of accounts, this set of tables is based on common concepts, definitions, classifica- tions and accounting rules as necessary prerequisites to comparability over time and across coun- tries. In designing the SHA an attempt has been made to provide a model for uniform reporting for countries with a wide range of different models of organising their national health systems. Consequently, the SHA comprises elements relevant for countries at various income levels. 1.3. The demand for improved health accounts is driven by an increasing complexity of health care systems in many countries and rapid evolution of medical technology. Policy-makers and ob- servers of health care systems and recent reforms have raised the question of the adequacy of current accounting practices and the ability of existing health accounts to monitor fast chang- ing health care systems that become increasingly complex. Raising expectations of consumers of health care contribute to the demand for up-to-date information on health care systems. The proposal of a three-dimensional International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA) 1.4. National Health Accounts usually take the form of two-dimensional tables cross-classifying expenditure by health care providers/programmes and by sources of funding. Coun try-A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 200012specific mixtures of institutional and functional criteria are currently used to classify health care providers. The resulting items (such as \"general hospital \", \"maternity clinic \", and \"family doctor \") have different contents across countries and result in overall boundaries of health spendings which differ among countries and change over time. 1.5. Over two decades of experience with international comparisons and health policy analysis on a national level suggest that a separation of institutional and functional aspects of health care services into two separate dimensions of reporting is essential to health accounting for international comparisons. This separation is also an indis- pensable tool to improve comparisons over time within National Health Accounts. This principle, only recently introduced in health accounting, has long been ob- served and applied in other data collections for functionally-defined fields of specific interest for public policy such as education, research and development, and social protection in general. 1.6. The provision of health care and its funding is a complex, multi-dimensional process. The set of core tables in the System of Health Accounts (SHA) addresses three basic questions: \u007fwhere does the money come from? (source of funding); \u007fwhere does the money go to? (provider of health care services and goods); \u007fwhat kind of (functionally-defined) services are performed and what types of goods are purchased? 1.7. Consequently, the SHA is organised around a tri-axial system for the recording of health expenditure, by means of a newly proposed International Classification for Health Ac- counts (ICHA), defining: \u007fhealth care by function (ICHA-HC); \u007fhealth care service provider industries (ICHA-HP); \u007fsources of funding health care (ICHA-HF). 1.8. These proposed classifications provide basic links with non-monetary data such as employment and other resource statistics. Existing national and international classifi- cations served as a starting point for the proposed classifications. The ICHA classifica- tion of health care industries, for example, presents a refinement of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC, Rev. 3, United Nations, 1990). Recently de- signed or revised classifications such as the Central Product Classification, Version 1 (United Nations, 1998 a) and the 1998 revision of the SNA 93 functional classifica- tions are referred to in this manual to assist statisticians who shift their national sys- tems to these revised classifications to establish links with the ICHA used in this manual. The choice of categories in the three dimensions of the ICHA was guided by their relevance for health policy and reform issues, in particular for monitoring structural changes, such as shifts from in-patient to out-patient care and the emergence and spread of multi-functional providers in national health care systems.\u00a9 OECD 2000 131. P RINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS Recent progress in health accounts and health care information systems 1.9. During the 1990s, an increasing number of countries reconsidered their accounting sys- tems. They were looking for strategies to enhance policy relevance, comprehensiveness, and internal consistency of health accounts and national health information systems in general. A broader view on public health has in several countries contributed to decisions to redesign existing systems of health care statistics and to foster their evolution into more comprehen- sive information systems which integrate data on socio-economic background factors (eco- nomic, social, physical environment) with data on expenditure and financing of health care services as well as non-monetary indicators for resource usage and outcomes measurement. 1.10. This manual has been written with the vision of more powerful statistical instruments than have been available in the past and which are now in place or are emerging in many coun- tries. It is expected that the availability of large databases with linked meso and micro-data will cover the many facets of health care in an ever more comprehensive way - revolutionising the task of health accounting on a national level by, at the same time, providing sound information to their mapping to the international comparable framework of the SHA. PURPOSES OF THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS 1.11. To sum up, the main purposes of the OECD System of Health Accounts are: \u007fto provide a set of internationally comparable health accounts in the form of standard tables; \u007fto define internationally harmonised boundaries of health care and basic categories thereof; \u007fto distinguish core health care functions from health-related functions and to empha- sise inter-sectoral aspects of health as a common concern of social and economic policy in various fields; \u007fto present tables for the analysis of flows of financing in health care together with a classification of insurance programmes and other funding arrangements; \u007fto provide a framework of main aggregates relevant to provide guidance for compara- tive research into the meso and micro structure of health care services; \u007fto propose a framework for consistent reporting on health care services over time; \u007fto monitor economic consequences of health care reform and health care policy; \u007fto provide a framework for analysing health care systems from an economic point of view, consistent with national accounting rules; \u007fto present an economic model of supply and use of health care services - as a tool to show the conceptual links between the System of Health Accounts and health satellite accounts. BACKGROUND 1.12. The SHA draws on the experience and lessons learned from National Health Accounts and national health information systems in OECD countries. A list that is far from exhaustive includes: Australian Health Data Committee, 1998; Canadian Institute for Health Infor- mation, 1999; and Wolfson, M.C., 1991, 1994; Social Insurance Institution, 1997 forA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 200014Finland; SESI, 1990, for France; Br \u00fcckner, 1996, 1998 and Sarrazin, 1999, for the German Health Information System; Lindsay and Newhouse, 1986; Lazenby et. al. , 1992; Levit et. al., 1996 , for the US Health Accounts; FUNSALUD, 1996, for Mexi- can Health Accounts. Progress in international comparisons of health expenditure estimates which have influenced this manual is documented in Waldo, 1996; van Mosseveld and van Son, 1999; Inspection G \u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S \u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale, 1998; and Schneider et. al. , 1995, 1998. 1.13.The OECD Health Accounts served as a reference system and, over time have become an informal quasi-standard for uniform reporting on health care systems (OECD, 1977; OECD, 1985; OECD, 1987; OECD, 1993; OECD, 1999 a). Over the years, harmonisation of concepts and definitions went hand in hand with the annual data collection by the OECD Secretariat of health and health care statistics. 1.14. In May 1996, the OECD convened an Ad Hoc Meeting of Experts in Health Statis- tics attended by delegates from most Member countries, as well as experts from Eurostat and from the European and Pan-American Regions of the World Health Organisation. Delegates were asked for their advice on ways to improve the contents, methodology, and procedures in OECD 's annual collection of health data. The development of international standards for data on health care expenditure and financing was singled out as a priority area for future OECD work. A first draft of this manual was dis- cussed at the Second Ad Hoc Meeting of Experts in Health Statistics, Paris, 3-5 De- cember, 1997. 1.15.A second draft version of the System of Health Accounts was then presented at the OECD Meeting of National Accounts Experts, 22-25 September 1998 and to the Meeting of the Working Party on Social Policy, 19-22 October 1998, which recommended the manual for publication and for use in pilot implementations. The discussions during these meetings focused on the overall methodological framework of the SHA and the design of the proposed International Classification for Health Accounts. The same draft was also discussed at a Workshop of Experts on Health Accounts hosted by the Irish Department of Health in Dublin from 30 September to 2 October 1998. Ques- tions of pilot implementations and the current state of National Health Accounts were on the agenda of a joint OECD/Eurostat Meeting on Health Accounting held in Lux- embourg on 11-12 May 1999. 1.16. Participants to these meetings discussed the draft System of Health Accounts , provided comments on a wide range of aspects of the manual and advised on further steps for implementation. The outcome of the last round of redrafting during 1999 has been clarification in the proposed classifications, a completely redrafted Chapter 6 on sources of funding and flows of financing, and a new Chapter 8 on the relationship between the SHA and health satellite accounts. Several chapters of the manual have been short- ened to improve the readability.\u00a9 OECD 2000 151. P RINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS LOOKING AHEAD : PILOT IMPLEMENTATIONS AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE MANUAL 1.17. As with any manual which is published as \"Version 1.0 \", the System of Health Accounts should be considered as work in progress. In particular, the proposed functional classifica- tion will have to be further developed in an interactive process, parallel with pilot imple- mentations on national level. Demand for additional detail might soon arise, as well as more hints on how to link macro and micro data, such as for procedural statistics and outcomes measurement, aspects not covered in the current version of the manual. Conse- quently, in coming years, Version 1.0 of the manual will be revised in light of discussions with health ministries and statistical agencies from OECD countries, as well as other inter- national and regional organisations working in the field of health care statistics. 1.18. More detailed estimation guidelines are expected to be an important by-product of pilot implementations. Estimation guidelines will provide more detail on practical aspects of implementing the SHA and further guidance on a common practice of reporting accord- ing to the ICHA categories. Pilot implementations have both the purpose of reporting core economic indicators on health care systems for international comparisons (to trans- form national data into proposed OECD standard tables) and for countries which choose to use the SHA as a model to enhance their national reporting system. 1.19. During the methodological discussions on the SHA, several countries expressed their in- terest in taking an active role in the further development of the manual and to engage in an interactive process of pilot implementations with the OECD Secretariat. The primary goal of pilot implementations will be a core set of draft standard tables for a sample of OECD countries. The process of pilot implementation will focus on the following tasks: \u007ffurther harmonisation of overall boundaries and main aggregates of health expendi- ture estimates across countries in order to improve international comparability of main aggregates, in particular in reinvestigating the boundaries between health and other social services (for example for frail elderly persons and for persons with disability); \u007frevisiting sources and estimation methods for private expenditure on health, which have been identified as a major source and margin of error in international comparisons; \u007fa complete breakdown of health expenditure by source of funding according to the ICHA financing classification; \u007ftwo-dimensional tables of health expenditure by health care function and provider category; \u007ftwo-dimensional tables of health expenditure by source of funding and provider category. 1.20.

THE ORGANISATION OF THE MANUAL : A READER 'S GUIDE 1.22. Chapter 1 through Chapter 8 introduce the conceptual framework and the basic defini- tions of the SHA. Chapter 9 through Chapter 11 discuss the proposed classifications in detail and deal with the boundaries of health care and the structure of the three dimen- sions making up the proposed International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Chapter 1 provides an overview of purposes and scope of the SHA. The hasty reader may skip the rest of Chapter 1 and proceed directly to the set of proposed standard tables in Chapter 2. 1.23. Chapter 3 outlines the basic definitions of functionally-defined boundaries of the health care system and sketches the main health and health-related functions. Functions of pro- duction and provision of health care services and medical goods, and administration are distinguished from health-related functions such as capital formation in health care indus- tries, education and training of health personnel, research and development in health, and environmental health. 1.24. The institutional view on health care systems is the subject of Chapter 4. Chapter 5 brings together the different aspects of measuring expenditure on health with a focus on common accounting rules and definitions of national totals that in addition provide the conceptual link to national economic aggregates. 1.25. Chapter 6 discusses the basic concepts of calculating the public-private mix in health care financing. This chapter shows how a set of financial accounts could serve to trace flows of financing from final expenditure on health back to the ultimate sources of funding. Chap- ter 7 comments on the role of price and volume measurement in health care and links the framework of the SHA to the current international discussion on improving price mea- surement in this important service industry. Methodological and practical differences as well as similarities between the System of Health Accounts and recommendations for health satellite analysis are covered in Chapter 8. 1.26. Chapter 9 defines the ICHA-HC functional dimension of the proposed International Classification for Health Accounts and gives detailed explanatory notes for the indi- vidual categories. The ICHA-HP institutional classification of providers is described in Chapter 10. The ICHA-HF classification of sources of funding is presented in Chapter 11.\u00a9 OECD 2000 171. P RINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS BASIC CRITERIA FOR THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS 1.27. The SHA shares the goal of the System of National Accounts to constitute an integrated system of comprehensive , internally consistent , and internationally comparable accounts, which should be compatible with other aggregate economic and social statistics as far as possible. These quality criteria of the SHA are competing with the goals of timeliness and precision , as well as with the policy sensitivity and relevance of the indicators provided by the SHA. Comprehensiveness 1.28. The SHA provides a comprehensive accounting framework for the whole field of health care activities. It is not limited to a specific range of public and private programmes, as is still the case in several countries ' National Health Accounts. In accordance to the func- tional approach, all programmes designed to provide health care or a substantial amount of health status enhancement by medical means should be included, whether labelled \"health care\" or not in national statistics. Consistency 1.29. The use of the boundaries and data distributions proposed by the ICHA should result in data collections which are more comparable across countries and more consistent over time . The uniform boundaries, for example, should prevent national expenditure aggregates from suddenly changing due to the migration of health care programmes from one minis- try to another or from one level of government to another. 1.30. Mapping national data to ICHA-categories should make data collections less affected by changing national definitions over time. The resulting time series should be capable of moni- toring past structural changes and serve as input for simulation and forecasting models. The latter are especially demanding in terms of quality and consistency of data over time. 1.31. The SHA is internally consistent by providing identities and accounting rules for cross- checking the validity of estimates derived along the different dimensions of the SHA. The reporting in the SHA on production, consumption and financing of health care in a con- sistent way serves as a means of identifying gaps and deficiencies in current reporting systems and health accounts, indicating where priorities should be set for continued qual- ity improvement of the statistical basis. International comparability 1.32. The proposed concepts and classifications should facilitate the national statisticians ' task to transform home-based observations into cross-country comparable data in order to enhance a greater level of communication among policy-makers and researchers. However, convergence of internationally comparable statistics can only be achieved gradually. Not-A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 200018withstanding the classifications and guidelines provided, a great deal of effort in develop- ment and pilot implementation will be necessary in order to determine the best method to operationalise the concepts proposed and to design detailed guidelines for surveys and estimation procedures. 1.33. Common functional boundaries of \"health care \" for international comparisons are prereq- uisites for the calculation of national totals for expenditure on health and its subcompo- nents. They have been identified as indispensable for international comparisons of population based health care statistics and other data with which the meso and microstruc- ture of health care can be analysed. Cost profiles of age-specific resource utilisation of health care is only one example of a statistic that is very sensitive to the exact boundaries of \"health care \" chosen in surveys (OECD, 1996 d). Compatibility 1.34. As an accounting framework built around a core set of tables in monetary-terms, the SHA has to be methodologically compatible with the System of National Accounts (SNA). Each item should be explicitly allocated to the SNA category to which it belongs (final con- sumption, intermediate consumption, capital formation, transfers of benefits, etc.). Meth- odological compatibility with the SNA is a prerequisite for calculating meaningful expenditure ratios and for international comparability. Different accounting rules applied nationally, for example how to allocate investment in health facilities over time, can signifi- cantly influence the outcome of health expenditure analysis in international comparisons. 1.35. Compatibility with SNA is, moreover, a means to achieve compatibility with other eco- nomic and social statistics. Price indices and structural data on value added in health care service industries are only two examples. 1.36. A general principle underlying the development of this manual has been to adopt defini- tions and concepts from existing statistical systems, approved and defined under the aus- pices of the United Nations and other international and regional organisations (UNESCO, WHO, the European Union). In areas not covered by UN-OECD-Eurostat classifica- tions, other widely used standards set by learned societies and regional organisations have been applied and modified where deemed appropriate. Cross-classifications between the categories proposed in this manual and international standard classifications are presented in the annexes to the volume. Timeliness and precision 1.37. Any set of quality criteria for accounting enters in potential conflict with other desirable goals, notably timeliness and precision of reporting (OECD, 1993). Precision relates to a minimum level of detail judged necessary in regular reporting. To consider a statistical survey in health accounting and health care resources as timely ideally means that at least\u00a9 OECD 2000 191. P RINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS preliminary data are available no later than six months after the end of the period they describe. For policy analysis, preliminary trend-projections are highly desirable. National Health Accounts are a basic tool underlying expenditure projections. 1.38. Timeliness conflicts with precision when large data sets and a multiplicity of surveys have to be combined, which is typically the case in health expenditure estimates. Projection models are already used in several countries to bridge gaps in the data and to provide preliminary estimates. Limited resources mean that detailed surveys can only be con- ducted on a multi-annual basis with interpolations for years in between surveys and ex- trapolations of the most recent period. Policy sensitivity 1.39. Policy sensitivity of the SHA is crucial in times of frequent changes of public policy in health care. In the past, the monitoring of economic consequences of health care reform was often obstructed by the inability of existing reporting systems to distinguish between changes in coverage and mode of financing and actual change. Important changes in the division of labour in health care were underreported due to out-dated classifications. THE SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTS 1.40. Over the last couple of years, a consensus has emerged among experts in health accounting that methodological compatibility with SNA 93 accounting rules is a prerequisite for health ac- counts meeting the basic requirements of comparability over time, between countries and with overall economic statistics. A co-ordinated effort bringing together specialists of health statis- tics with experts in national accounting could be an efficient way to avoid duplication in work, especially with respect to the methodological design of an accounting framework, but also by making the best use of existing data sources for this major segment of national economies. 1.41. The 1993 Revision of the System of National Accounts (SNA 93) makes frequent refer- ence to statistical problems specific to the health care system and includes a special chapter on functionally oriented satellite accounts as a general framework for a health satellite account. Implementation of satellite accounts for environment, agriculture, household production and tourism in several countries has fostered the process of clarifying method- ological questions related to satellite accounts in general. 1.42. Over the last few years, several countries have reconciled their National Health Accounts with the System of National Accounts which is the central point of reference for overall economic and social statistics. There is, however, less consensus among experts on how far the integration of health accounts should go with the production side of national income accounts, that is in calculations of the value-added structure and/or a satellite input-output table for health. Chapter 8 summarises conceptual overlap as well as differences between the SHA and health satellite accounts.PART I CONCEPTS AND METHODS FOR HEALTH ACCOUNTS\u00a9 OECD 2000 232. A SET OF STANDARD TABLES 2.1. The SHA, in its present version, proposes the following set of inter-linked tables each showing different aspects of health care services. Development and implementation of this sequence of tables will depend on adequate funding within each country 's statistical programmes. The SHA is flexible in that not all aspects need to be developed at once, nor necessarily on an annual basis. An incremental implementation over several years will be necessary for a majority of countries. 2.2. A large number of standard tables on health care with statistics in non-monetary terms are already included in the OECD Secretariat 's annual data collection OECD Health Data . Ongoing work attempts to further harmonise these concepts across countries and with the SHA. The standard tables are the following: Table 1. Current expenditure on health by function of care, provider and source of funding (= total uses of resident units of health care services and goods by function of care, provider and source of funding; at current prices). Table 2. Current expenditure on health by function of care and provider industry (= total uses of resident units of health care services and goods by function of care and provider industry; at current prices). Table 3. Current expenditure on health by provider industry and source of fund- ing (= total uses of residents of health care services and goods by provider industry and by source of funding; at current prices).

ESTIMATION STRATEGIES AND FLOWS OF INFORMATION IN HEALTH ACCOUNTING 2.3. Estimation strategies in health accounting make use of existing administrative flows of information complemented with specialised surveys. Administrative records kept by government and private insurance companies contain a wealth of information on transactions. A basic breakdown is usually available allowing outlays to be tracked to the corresponding provider of health care. For private out-of-pocket and other non-insurance- type outlays (charities, export and import of services) special surveys are usually required to complement the picture. Figure 2.1.

A S ET OF STANDARD TABLES 2.4. Aggregated, this information is documented in National Health Accounts in cross-classifi- cation tables showing expenditure on health by financing unit and health care provider. The margins of such a tabular presentation show the breakdown of expenditure by financ- ing and by receiving provider. Row and column margin totals and grand totals all have to be equal, providing a basic cross-check of the data. A boundary line separating public and private financing is usually drawn in this type of accounts. Figure 2.1 shows flows of information underlying health accounting. 2.5. The fundamental boundary-line delimiting total expenditure on health is drawn in the SHA along the functional definitions of services and goods in the ICHA. In order to achieve common boundaries in health accounting, the identification of these func- tions in the standard tables described above is required. For international compari- sons, this task can be approached in different ways. A first approximation of common boundaries can be achieved (at least for public expenditure on health) by adding up health care programmes across sources of funding by selecting only those programmes where the (functionally-defined) health care component amounts to more than half of the outlays. 2.6. A more refined approach would use the cross-classification of expenditure on health by sources of funding and by providers as a starting point. For calculating total expen- diture on health, every cell in such a table would have to be checked against the func- tional breakdown and the boundaries of the ICHA. A cell would be added to total expenditure on health if spendings on health care functions were predominant. Fur- ther precision would be achieved by identifying the share of individual health care functions in each of these cells. Total expenditure on health would then be the sum of the sub-functions identified in this way over both sources of funding and providers. In many cases, data cross-classified by financing and health care provider represent the smallest pieces of information available in administrative records and, more generally, the data underlying National Health Accounts. 2.7. The summary descriptions presented below each standard tables include hints for estima- tion strategies. Pilot implementations in several countries and further enhancement of the set of health spending indicators collected annually for OECD Health Data will help de- ciding on which subset of tables of the type presented here will represent an optimal com- promise between information needs by health policy analysts, data availability, and international comparability.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 26Table 1.

A S ET OF STANDARD TABLES This table shows total final uses by resident units of health care services and goods by function of care, selected provider industries and source of funding. It illustrates how the three ICHA dimensions can be combined in a flexible way to provide a core set of indicators on health spending and its financing.

The estimation will involve both an analysis of the accounts and activity data for providers and the estimation of output by provider groups. In a first step, production of health care services and goods has to be separated from non-health care produc- tion. This is especially relevant for establishments of nursing and residential care facilities and for establishments providing home health care services. These providers may produce a significant share of non-health care output which has to be subtracted from their total output when health accounts are reconciled with production accounts of providers. Establishments of medical retail sales may also sell a significant share of non-medical goods. The input-output model described in Chapter 8 illustrates how these estimates can be checked against double counting and omissions. Imports and exports will have to be estimated separately. Ideally, it should be possible - at least for major industries, like hospitals - to double check health care production by provider by deducting the above mentioned items from overall production (directTable 2.

A S ET OF STANDARD TABLES method) and by adding up services (and goods) over types of care and sources of funding (indirect method). The estimation of the item \"All other industries \" is only possible indirectly by identifying corresponding services and goods. For many industries, however, surveys or records of sufficient quality will not be available for calculating reliable direct estimates. Hidden production may be an important share of production for certain types of establishments in some countries (such as doctors in private practice, but also for hospitals). The introduction of busi- ness surveys for health care industries - especially in the ambulatory and nursing and residential care industries - would be an important tool for improving health accounts. The provision of public-health services and general government administration - though being allo- cated to different classes in the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC, Rev. 3) - may be difficult to allocate to separate establishments. Estimation rules which are actually applied should be documented in meta data.Health care provider industry Dispensing All other Provision and General health Government Social Other Other All other All other Rest and other chemists sales of administration administration administration security social (private) health industries of the providers of medical of public and insurance of health funds insurance insurance administration world medical goods health goods programmesA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 30This table shows total final uses of resident units of health care services and goods by provider industry and source of funding at current (purchasers ') prices.

A S ET OF STANDARD TABLES The breakdown for private household expenditure can be partly estimated indirectly as a residual by subtracting public expenditure from total output of health care for some well-documented industries (e.g., dispensing pharmacies).

Consent on a common functional classification and of the boundary of health care is crucial for the complex tasks of international comparisons. The ICHA-HC functional classification proposed as one of the three dimensions of the International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA) is designed to provide detailed guidelines for drawing harmonised, uniform boundaries, and for reporting on a sufficiently large number of sub- categories relevant for health planners and policy-makers. This chapter discusses bound- aries of health care proposed in the ICHA-HC and basic categories. The two- and three-digit level of this classification are provided in Chapter 9 together with a more detailed discus- sion of selected boundary issues. Cross-classifications with other international classifica- tions are presented in the annexes to Chapter 9. THE FUNCTIONAL BOUNDARIES OF HEALTH CARE 3.2. The boundaries of a functionally-defined health care system delimit the subject areaof health accounts. This approach is \"functional \" in that it refers to the goals or purposes of health care such as disease prevention, health promotion, treatment, re- habilitation and long-term care. Although the exact functional boundaries will be- come apparent from the functional classification itself, it seems an appropriate starting point to spend some time in considering the underlying philosophy guiding the ICHA- HC. The following summary provides the most important basic concepts and bound- ary criteria that have been used for delimiting the field of health care for the purposes of the SHA.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 42The concept of health care underlying the design of the ICHA-HC functional classification Activities of health care in a country comprises the sum of activities performed either by institutions or individuals pursuing, through the application of medical, paramedical and nursing knowledge and technology, the goals of: \u007fpromoting health and preventing disease; \u007fcuring illness and reducing premature mortality; \u007fcaring for persons affected by chronic illness who require nursing care; \u007fcaring for persons with health-related impairment, disability, and handicaps who require nursing care; \u007fassisting patients to die with dignity; \u007fproviding and administering public health; \u007fproviding and administering health programmes, health insurance and other fund- ing arrangements. 3.3. From the criteria listed above follow several rules of thumb to delineate the field of health care within the SHA. The prerequisite of a basic level of medical and nursing knowledge refers in most cases to national standards of accreditation or licensing for health care person- nel. This qualifies them to practice their medical and nursing knowledge. Boundary cases are traditional medicine or accepted alternative practices such as Chinese medicine, antroposophic medicine, etc., which have to be dealt with individually on a country-by-country basis. 3.4. In the context of the SHA, general public safety measures like technical standards moni- toring, road safety, etc., are not considered as application of medical technology and are, for that reason, excluded from the core health care functions. Food and hygiene monitor- ing, as well as surveillance of drinking water are, however, overlapping functions between safety and health and are covered under separate categories in the ICHA-HC as health- related functions for separate reporting as memorandum items. These functions are not included in total expenditure on health in the SHA. HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH -RELATED FUNCTIONS 3.5. The SHA is structured around a core set of functions which health care systems perform as shown in Table 3.1. A more detailed discussion of guiding principles is given below. Health care comprises personal health care services provided directly to individual persons and collective health care services covering traditional tasks of public health such as health promotion and disease prevention including setting and enforcement of standards (HC.6), and health administration and health insurance (HC.7). Personal health care services comprise services of curative care, of rehabilitative care, services of a (long-term) nursing- type care, ancillary services to health care and medical goods dispensed to out-patients which include self-medication and other goods consumed by households with or without a prescription from medical or paramedical professionals.\u00a9 OECD 2000 433.

The functions of health care refer to the final consumption of goods and services in pursu- ing the goals listed above. This includes not only activities such as hospital treatments, home visits by paramedical professions or vaccination campaigns, but also the supporting activities directly involved in the production and provision of these services: clerical and other administrative tasks in doctors ' offices; administration, technical and other support- ing activities performed in hospitals ( e.g., cleaning and laundry) (see Chapter 5 for more details on the measurement of expenditure). MODES OF PRODUCTION In-patient care, day care, out-patient care and home care 3.7. The basic subdivision into in-patient care, day care, out-patient and home care corresponds to an essential difference in the underlying technical and managerial organisation of care. As a result, these subsystems of care are typically governed by substantially different infor- mation systems. In-patient and day care involves the formal admission and discharge of patients involving a considerable amount of administrative paperwork and statistics. This has also led to the design in many countries of basic standard datasets on patients and the treatments they receive with the goal of making them comparable across institutions. 3.8. Day care and home care are of growing importance and play a key role in more efficient case management in OECD countries. Day care and home care are therefore reportedA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 44under separate modes of production. The corresponding definitions adopted from na- tional health information systems that served as models for the ICHA-HC classification are listed in Chapter 9. Medical goods dispensed to out-patients 3.9. The distinction between the functions HC.1 to HC. 4 (which cover mainly the delivery of services) and HC.5 (medical goods dispensed to out-patients) does not draw a rigid border- line between the two classes of products or activities (services and goods) in a strict economic sense. Commodities listed under the heading of \"goods \", such as pharmaceuticals bought in pharmacies, prostheses sold and adapted by specialised retail traders and similar products, are a joint product, considered as goods acquired or dispensed together with medical advice. 3.10. Medical goods dispensed, prescribed or bought by private households at their own initia- tive for the purpose of home care could be interpreted as intermediate products to house- hold production of health care services. All these goods are, however, reported under final consumption in the SHA. These goods can cover a wide range from incontinence material to home dialysis kits. The definition and measurement of household production of health care as understood here is presented in Chapter 5. Prevention and public health services 3.11. Public health services are mainly of a preventive nature and comprise a range of publicly provided services such as epidemiological surveillance and other measures of health pro- motion and disease prevention and related general public health activities. These include special public health services such as blood-bank operation, public health service laborato- ries, and population planning services. School health services should be recorded under this heading, whereas prison health services are recorded under corresponding categories of personal health care. 3.12. Included under public health services is occupational health care, an ancillary activity within industry and administration, which in the case of industry is treated by SNA as intermediate consumption. It is governed in most countries by detailed regulations. Specific recommen- dations and guidelines, notably to avoid double-counting under health care, pharmaceutical and medical-technical industries, are provided in Chapter 5 on the measurement of expendi- ture. A cross-classification of public health functions in ICHA-HC and WHO \"Essential functions of public health \" (EFPHs) is provided in Annex 9.3 of Chapter 9. Health administration and health insurance 3.13. Health administration and health insurance are activities performed by private insurers and by central, regional and local authorities including social security funds. They include the planning, management, regulation, and collection of funds and handling of claims of the\u00a9 OECD 2000 453. B ASIC FUNCTIONS AND GLOBAL BOUNDARIES OF HEALTH CARE delivery system. This excludes the administration of health care providers which is not treated as a separate function in the ICHA but included in the valuation of the service functions. 3.14. Health administration and health insurance is shown as a separate function isolating the goods and services it finances from the management and funding of these goods and ser- vices. This corresponds to the separation of social insurance funds and the health insur- ance industry from health care service industries of provider organisations in the ICHA-HP provider classification. The separate recording of administration is straightforward when- ever different establishments are involved in health care services on the one hand, and insurance and programme administration on the other. This function does not include the administration and operation of social protection programmes providing social pro- tection in the form of cash benefits, although this separation may be difficult in practice and can only be done by approximation. 3.15. The distinction between the functions of personal and collective services and the administration of funds may be less obvious where provision and financing of health care are closely integrated, which can be the case in institutional arrangements under a National Health Service or in certain types of health maintenance organisations or other integrated health care organisations. HC.7, Administration corresponds roughly to COFOG 07.6, Health n.e.c. and COICOP 12.5.3, Insurance connected with health. Further cross- classifications between the ICHA-HC and COFOG/COICOP are provided in Annex 9.2 to Chapter 9. FURTHER DIMENSIONS FOR CLASSIFYING PERSONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES 3.16. The basic dividing lines for structuring the ICHA-HC functional classification as de- scribed above are personal versus public health services, basic purposes of care (curative, rehabilitative and long-term care), and modes of production (in-patient, out-patient, etc.). Further subdivisions of personal health care services can be designed along the lines of several additional dimensions of health care, as listed in Table 3.2. National classifications in use for health accounting are often of a hybrid type which in many instances combine some of these additional dimensions in their national breakdown of expenditure (mainly client or diagnostic aspects such as mental health, other specialities, care for the aged) and professional categories, clinical specialities and institutional aspects. For the purpose of international comparisons these dimensions should be kept separately. 3.17. For several important types of health policy analysis, it would be essential to establish national surveys and or micro-data sets which - integrated in comprehensive health infor- mation systems - should be sufficiently detailed to allow reporting according to any of the following breakdowns - at least on the basis of model calculations. 3.18. Complementary, more uniformly standardised reporting is suggested for the following subcategories (see Table 3.3) of the functional classification where national informationA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 46systems in a growing number of OECD countries have made the corresponding data avail- able over the last ten or fifteen years. Table 3.3 is not exhaustive but illustrates how the ICHA-HC classification can be used as a basis for more detailed international compari- sons of resource utilisation. Table 3.2.

Basic medical and Number of patients and contacts with the primary care system diagnostic services HC.5.1.1 Pharmaceuticals Consumption of pharmaceuticals by major ATC-groups 3.19. Unfortunately, the reporting in international comparisons on many of the items listed in Tables 3.2 and 3.3 is still in its infancy, although some progress has been made over the last couple of years in reporting on expenditure by age groups and broad disease categories (see OECD, 1999 a for these and further breakdown of health care activities). Examples of\u00a9 OECD 2000 473. B ASIC FUNCTIONS AND GLOBAL BOUNDARIES OF HEALTH CARE uniform classifications which are already used in complementary calculations of health expenditure in a growing number of countries are tabulations by age and gender and by disease (so called cost-of-illness estimates). Both types of standard tables provide impor- tant additional insight into the microstructure of expenditure for health policy planning. Personal health care by age and gender 3.20. Health expenditure by age and gender should be calculated on a periodic basis for the subaggregate of health care services and goods (= personal health care) within measured total expenditure on health. Experiences with international comparisons of health expen- diture by age and gender demonstrate that it is important not to use too broad age catego- ries for uniform reporting (OECD, 1996 d). This is especially crucial for higher ages. On the basis of information available for several OECD countries, per capita health expendi- ture reaches a peak for the 75-84 year age bracket and declines afterwards. Expenditure surveys should therefore not stop at the age of 75 or 80 but should include higher strata as well (particularly since clusters of diseases appear to move up with age over time and may shift the slope just cited). Cost-of-illness estimates 3.21. Cost-of-illness studies make estimates of the direct and indirect economic burden incurred in a period of time as a result of the prevalence of the disease during this same base period, most often a year. Here, prevalence costs measure the value of resources used or lost during a specified period of time, regardless of the disease onset. For the SHA, only a breakdown according to a direct cost-of-illness estimate is suggested, given the number of assumptions and hypotheses going into so-called indirect cost-of-illness estimates (hypothetical amount of lost production due to morbidity or premature mortality). HEALTH-RELATED FUNCTIONS 3.22. Health-related functions should be distinguished from the core of health care functions. They can be very closely linked to health care in terms of operations, institutions and personnel, but should, as far as possible, be excluded when measuring activities belonging to core health care functions. 3.23. The separate reporting on the following health-related functions is desirable: Capital for- mation of health care providers (HC.R.1), Education and training of health personnel (HC.R.2), Research and development in health (HC.R.3), Food, hygiene and drinking water control (HC.R.4) Environmental health (HC.R.5), Administration and provision of social services in kind to assist living with disease and impairment (HC.R.6) and Ad- ministration and provision of health-related cash benefits to private households (HC.R.7). It is desirable to include these items in regular reporting on health care systems under separate headings. All of these functions constitute relevant parameters under health policy.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 48Explanatory notes for tackling the boundary problems arising from health-related func- tions are given in Chapter 9. Reporting on supporting activities to health care services and line items 3.24. Supporting activities within health care provision (management and administration in provider institutions, technical service units, transport, gardening, and the like) have not been included as separate items in the functional classification nor does the functional classification provide a breakdown of health care activities into line items (such as expenses on personnel, various intermediate products, consumption of fixed capital). These items are already included under the various categories of the functional classification if properly accounted. There are no methodological difficulties to report on supporting activities and/or line items of providers in health accounting, but the only way to do so while avoid- ing double counting is to include a corresponding additional dimension in the ICHA. For international comparisons, this was not considered a high priority task but is under con- sideration for a Version 2 of this manual. APPLYING THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION 3.25. The items in the functional classification refer to commodities and thus to the functional structure of output of the health care system. This should not be confused with functions reported in the cost structure of providers or in the input structure of services involved in medical treatment complexes. Cost structure and input structure may have similar head- ings (or \"functions \") in national reporting systems. The concepts of statistical unit and reporting unit help clarify this as well as related questions on how to implement the func- tional distribution in the SHA. The following remarks and suggestions for implementa- tion are first and foremost necessary to understand and correctly interpret the functional items proposed. More detailed guidelines for implementation will become available dur- ing the process of pilot implementations of the SHA and be made available on the OECD/ SHA Internet site quoted in the Foreword. The statistical unit 3.26. The statistical unit is the entity for which statistics on the functional breakdown are com- piled. It may be an observation unit on which information is received and statistics are compiled or an analytical unit which statisticians create by splitting or combining observa- tion units with the help of estimations or imputations in order to supply more detailed and/or homogenous data than would otherwise be possible. 3.27. The statistical unit in the functional distribution within the SHA is a specific functionally- defined output of health care industries for final use. The smallest item for reporting could be a patient contact with the health care system that would be allocated to a unique\u00a9 OECD 2000 493. B ASIC FUNCTIONS AND GLOBAL BOUNDARIES OF HEALTH CARE function of the ICHA-HC according to the main procedure performed. In practice, the definition of output items has to be taken from existing national health information sys- tems and depends in each country on the prevailing payment modalities and survey proce- dures of providers of these health care services. 3.28. Services classified according to price-lists in fee-for-service payment systems may be taken as observation units which then need to be cross-classified to the ICHA-HC functions by use of programme-specific conversion tables. Providers, paid on a per-capita basis by total production cost, are an example of an analytical unit. Survey samples or partial estimates are then necessary to distribute total cost to functions of health care, either by estimating time (or other input measures) spent on different procedures or by the number of patients or cases (diagnoses/treatments). 3.29. Where \"treatment episodes \" are remunerated as a whole, as in the case of diagnosis-related payment systems (DRGs), it is advisable not to split these complexes into separate func- tions but to allocate the whole treatment according to the main purpose of procedure performed. The underlying rationale of this approach is that various service functions embodied in a treatment episode should be seen as inputs to the production of this more comprehensive service, not as final products. 3.30. For the functions of the ICHA-HC covering the distribution of medical goods, the same criterion for distinguishing between input and output applies. Only the consumption of pharmaceuticals received from pharmacies or dispensing providers (including general re- tailers or mail-order) should be reported under the corresponding function in the ICHA- HC. Pharmaceuticals consumed in the course of a treatment, like surgery performed in an institutional or ambulatory setting, are considered inputs to the service \"surgery \", to be reported under a corresponding item, not under \"distribution of pharmaceuticals \". Where pharmaceuticals are directly dispensed by medical practitioners, an attempt should be made to separate the pharmaceutical expenses from the treatment expenses. Guidelines on how to do this will have to be developed on a country-by-country basis. 3.31. Other boundary cases exist, for which this distinction may be questioned. An example is provided by a stay in the hospital with the primary aim to identify the most suitable and beneficial medication and dosage. The same pharmaceutical treatment is, according to the philosophy proposed, treated differently during the initial treatment on the one hand and for the equivalent follow-up treatment on the other. Also, dialysis fluid used in hospitals is an input into the treatment of dialysis as a function of care, not to be recorded separately. The same products used for home-dialysis, however, would be recorded separately. 3.32. The expenditure reported under \"Medical goods \" may be interpreted as inputs to the household production of health care at home, either by the patient himself or with the help of household members. The question \"how much pharmaceuticals/medical goods of a specific sort are used in the production or consumption of health care services in aA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 50country \" can only be answered by introducing a complementary functional distribution for the cost structure (intermediate input and value-added) in health care services industries. Conceptually, this should not be a problem, but the statistical surveys to fill such tables with data may be quite demanding. For selected items, like pharmaceuticals, the corre- sponding information is available in many countries - not only in the files of the pharma- ceutical industry - and has entered international comparative reporting for OECD countries (see OECD, 1999 a).\u00a9 OECD 2000 514. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INDUSTRIES INTRODUCTION 4.1. The production and the provision of health care services along with their financing take place in a wide range of institutional settings that vary across countries. The way of organising health care services reflects the country-specific division of labour between providers of health care services which is becoming increasingly complex in many coun- tries. It is a commonly observed phenomenon that institutions with similar names such as \"General Hospital \", \"Acute Hospital \", \"Psychiatric Hospital \" often do not perform identical roles in different health care systems. A tendency towards greater vertical inte- gration can be observed in many countries both in the hospital sector where some institu- tions assemble a growing number of sub-units (for both in-patient and out-patient care) under one roof - sometimes aiming at a more profitable mix of health with non-health services and products. 4.2. A classification of health care industries serves the purpose of arranging country-specific institutions into common, internationally applicable categories and providing tools for linking data on personnel and other resource inputs as well as output and outcome mea- surement to the SHA. The institutional breakdown of the health care service industry into categories of providers also serves as a basic building block of an economic model of the health care system as discussed in Chapter 8. 4.3. This chapter introduces a classification of institutional units of the health care system, the ICHA-HP provider classification for health care industries. Chapter 10 presents this classification in detail and gives a cross-classification between ICHA-HP and the Interna- tional Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC, Rev. 3). Such a cross-classification is essential, as ISIC will continue providing the basis for business surveys, employment and census data. The basic criteria for classifying health care providers by industries of theA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 52ICHA-HP will be the principal activity of establishments. This means that fundamental rules for applying the institutional classification will be identical for both the ICHA-HP and ISIC. 4.4. The classification of institutional units of health care providers links expenditure on health and their production, including resources used (personnel, health care facili- ties). It would be advantageous if national statistics sustained a well-defined link (cross-classifications) between the institutional dimension of National Health Accounts, the ICHA-HP provider classification, and industrial statistics according to ISIC. A cross-classification of the ICHA-HP provider classification and ISIC is provided in Chapter 10. INDUSTRIES OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITHIN THE ECONOMY 4.5. The ICHA-HP provider classification comprises both primary producers of health care and secondary producers. The principal activity performed by primary producers is health care services. Examples are hospitals or doctors ' offices. Secondary producers provide health care services beside their principal activity as secondary activity. Examples are resi- dential care institutions which provide mainly social services such as sheltered houses but in combination with health care services, for example intensive long-term nursing care or Figure 4.1.

H EALTH CARE PROVIDER INDUSTRIES psychiatric care. Consequently, the ICHA-HP classifies both primary and secondary pro- ducers of health care and several classes in the ICHA-HP may comprise both of them. Examples are retail sales of medical goods, administration, and nursing and residential care. 4.6. Producers of intermediate products to health care are not considered providers of medical care in the ICHA-HP . Examples are the following items in the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC, Rev. 3): \u007f2423Manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemicals and botanical products; \u007f3311Manufacture of medical and surgical equipment and orthopaedic appliances. 4.7. The ICHA-HP departs from standard industrial classifications by including private house- holds, which are in exceptional cases regarded as providers of health care services in the SHA, and occupational health care (see Chapter 5). Figure 4.1 summarises the breakdown of the domestic economy into health care provider industries and other industries which underlies the ICHA-HP . THE CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INDUSTRIES 4.8. The International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) needed refinements and modi- fications for the purposes of the SHA. First, Section N, \"Health and Social Work \" is not detailed enough. Community centres, for example, and other integrated care providers are not listed explicitly. 4.9. Apparently, ISIC did not evolve sufficiently while large organisational reforms took place in health care. Mixed health care institutions, for example for institutional and ambula- tory health care services, or integrated care units like community health centres do not easily fit into the ISIC. The recently developed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) presents a good starting point for classifying health care institutions pro- viding both sufficient details to map fast changing and complex health care systems and general definitions to be used for health care systems in a wider range of countries. The proposed ICHA-HP industry classification is essentially a modification of this classifica- tion for the purposes of OECD countries (Table 4.1). ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS 4.10. The ICHA-provider classification does not distinguish between public or private owner- ship or control of institutions, the size and legal status of establishments or regional aspects (community hospitals versus state or national centres for emergency treatment). An addi- tional breakdown, according to these dimensions will be added in many National Health Accounts and has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. 4.11. In addition, a complete institutional sectoring of health care institutions according to SNA guidelines could provide useful information on the economic role of institutions andA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 54Table 4.1.

Table 4.2 shows the basic classification used in the SNA for grouping by sector and type of unit and gives examples for corresponding health care institutions. A grouping of the health care system into SNA sectors may also be a requisite to health satellite accounts, depending on the degree of linkage with the central SNA framework chosen (Chapter 8).\u00a9 OECD 2000 554. H EALTH CARE PROVIDER INDUSTRIES 4.12. The subdivision of institutions performing public administration and providing insurance and other forms of insurance closely resembles the basic sectoral classification of the SNA (see Chapter 6 for further details and guidelines on sectoring sources of funding). The WHO model of levels of care 4.13. Some countries have, in addition, adopted the WHO-model of categorising health care facilities into primary, secondary and tertiary levels of care. Sectoring of institutions into these categories - where they exist - is of particular interest in health policy monitoring. At present, the use of the terminology is not sufficiently standardised or used uniformly by OECD countries for the purposes of the SHA. A cross-classification of national institu- tional terminology and of the ICHA-provider classification should allow identification of country-specific planning mechanisms for health care industries. APPLYING THE ICHA-HP HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CLASSIFICATION 4.14. The statistical unit, i.e. the unit for which statistics are compiled in the SHA is the same for all three dimensions of the ICHA (see Chapter 3) in order to allow the cross-classification of expenditure in multi-dimensional tables (see the proposed standard tables in Chapter 2). The reporting unit in the institutional classification 4.15. The reporting unit is the entity from which the recommended items of data are collected. It may be an enterprise of health care organisations on which information is received andTable 4.2.

The smallest item for reporting in an institutional distribution of the SHA would ideally be establishments producing a homogenous range of services that gives the establishment a well-defined, internationally comparable role in the division of labour in a country 's health care system. These are units that have their own accounting in order to preserve an option to link data on input (cost structure) and output to expenditure data in a straightforward man- ner. Human resources and employment in health care 4.17. The framework of the ICHA-HP leads to a family of national aggregates and distributions for human resources and employment in the SHA. A concept for measuring human re- sources in health care in a stock-flow approach providing various ways of defining medical and paramedical professions is discussed in Annex A.1 of this manual. The most impor- tant statistics are: \u007ftotal employment in health care service industries , which is the sum of persons working in one of the above-defined institutional units, distributed according to ICHA-HP; and preferably measured as full-time equivalents; \u007ftotal employment of medical and paramedical professions in health care industries , again distributed according to ICHA-HP . Medical facilities and stocks of medical equipment 4.18. Country-specific listings of health care institutions are the starting point of national sur- veys in health care service industries which provide data on capital stock and health care resources in non-monetary terms. A range of indicators is desirable to measure specific medical equipment and health facilities such as beds in institutions and high-technology equipment. Full consistency with the expenditure series would require that these data collections were cross-classified with the ICHA-HP institutional classification. Once a country-specific list of institutions and a cross-classification to the ICHA-HP classification has been established, it should not be too difficult to classify, e.g. employment, accordingly.\u00a9 OECD 2000 575. MEASUREMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH CARE INTRODUCTION 5.1. This chapter provides definitions for aggregate measures of expenditure on health care. It is therefore central to the SHA. The proposed accounting rules correspond to SNA guide- lines and are thus compatible with the common internationally recognised accounting rules for defining national economic aggregates. Chapter 8 on health satellite analysis and accounts further extends this discussion about economic modelling of health care and its integration in the core system of National Accounts for use by experts in countries consid- ering or maintaining health satellite accounts for their national health care system. THE ESTIMATION OF NATIONAL TOTALS Total expenditure on health measures the final use of resident units of health care goods and services plus gross capital formation in health care provider industries (institutions where health care is the predominant activity). 5.2. Total expenditure on health thus measures the economic resources spent by a country on the functions HC.1 to HC.7 of health care services and goods, including administration and insurance plus gross capital formation in health care industries (Table 5.1). The distinction between total current expenditure on health and gross capital formation in health care in- dustries appears to be important. Gross capital formation in health care industries are those expenditure that add to the stock of resources of the health care system and last more than an annual accounting period. Gross capital formation can further be classified by type of institutional unit involved in the provision of health care services (see Chapter 4). 5.3. Total expenditure is, according to the above definition, part of total gross domestic expen- diture. It should, by definition, not include exports of health care services, i.e. servicesA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 58provided by domestic providers to foreigners but includes imports of health care, such as health spending abroad by tourists and other persons travelling abroad. 5.4. In this chapter guidelines are provided on the following issues which are crucial to the estimation of national totals of health spending in an international comparable way: \u007fwhere to draw the production boundary of health care services; \u007fhow to treat subsidies and other transfers to health care provider industries; \u007fthe measurement of market and non-market output of health care services; \u007finternational trade in medical goods and services; \u007ftime of recording and the accrual principal. 5.5. In addition, some hints are provided for the estimation of expenditure on health-related functions other than capital formation of provider industries. Table 5.1.

The SHA recommends standard SNA rules for drawing the production boundary of health care services, with two exceptions: \u007foccupational health care is included in the national totals of health care spending. In the SNA, this item is recorded as ancillary services and part of intermediate production of enterprises; \u007fpart of the cash transfers to private households for care givers of home care for the sick and disabled are treated as paid household production of health care. Occupational health care 5.7. This aggregate is the sum of expenditure incurred by corporations, general government, and non-profit organisations on the provision of occupational health care. Occupational health care corresponds to Item 5.2: Health in the Classification of the Outlays of Produc- ers by Purpose (COPP) (see Annex A.6 of this manual). Occupational health care is re- corded in the SNA as intermediate consumption within the business sector. Occupational\u00a9 OECD 2000 595. M EASUREMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH CARE health care includes surveillance of employee health (routine medical check-ups) and thera- peutic care (including emergency health care services) on or off business premises; this ex- cludes remuneration in kind in health services and goods which do not constitute intermediate consumption but household actual final consumption. The expenditure incurred in occu- pational health care can be approximately estimated as the cost of personnel involved. Household production of health care 5.8. The production of health care services not only takes place in establishments (including pri- vate non-profit institutions) but also in private households, where care for the sick, infirm or old people is provided by family members. The own-account production of these personal services by members of the household for their own final consumption is excluded from mea- sured production in conventional national accounting practice. The boundary line drawn in the SHA includes, however, personal services provided within households by family members, in cases where they correspond to social transfer payments granted for this purpose. 5.9. Problems of data comparability across countries and over time arise when households have the choice between benefits in cash or benefits in kind, in which case both kinds of care (by laypersons within the family and by specially trained nurses) are considered to be close substitutes but treated differently in common national accounting practice (as health care benefit in kind or social transfer in cash). Consequently it is recommended that for this sort of cash transfer it is considered as \"paid\" household production. The part of these payments which corresponds to care given to family members should be recorded under final consumption expenditure (final use) of health and not under transfer payments. The corresponding item should be shown separately in health accounts. 5.10. This treatment adopted by the SHA explicitly recognises that the unpaid work devoted to the home care of household members has an economic value which is measured in mon- etary terms. It also is consistent with the definition of non-market household production which covers those goods and services provided for own-consumption by household mem- bers who combine their unpaid work within the household and goods and services pro- vided by the market to satisfy the needs of every-day life. The widely accepted criterion used to define productive unpaid work and correlatively, non-market household produc- tion is the existence of a market substitute. The household member performing care ac- tivities within the household has, as substitute, a remunerated person who would be hired to perform similar tasks for the dependant person. The substitute to household produc- tion of health care is the output of private or public institutions providing similar services. 5.11. Substitutability between household production and production on the market exists in actual fact when social programmes give households the choice between receiving social transfers in cash for health care provided by them and benefits in kind in the form of the services of a trained nurse financed, partly or totally, by the social programme. In the case where substitut- ability is not quite as obvious and households receive transfer payments for the health care theyA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 60provide within the household instead of having recourse to outside help, the economic value of their care activities is nonetheless recognised in the SHA since non-market household produc- tion of health care services is imputed a value equal to the transfer payments received. 5.12. This valuation is based on the assumption that the value of the unpaid care work per- formed in the household is worth what social programmes are willing to grant. This is of course not a totally satisfactory treatment since the actual amount of time spent on health care work is not taken into consideration. Nevertheless it is preferable to no valuation at all, and therefore no consideration of hours spent on care, which is the case when no choice or monetary support is granted to households. Health care as part of the informal sector 5.13. The concealed production of health services (to avoid the payment of income or other taxes or to achieve hidden additional income besides that under contracts with social in- surance and/or government programmes) may amount to a sizeable share of the real medi- cal benefits accruing to private households. An estimate of this amount should be part of total expenditure on health as defined by the SHA, as differences in the treatment of the informal health care sector can distort international comparisons. 5.14. The national health expenditure estimates of some countries have, in the past, under-reported so-called \"under-the-counter \" or \"envelope \" payments by patients paid directly to providers. These payments do not show up in tax declarations of providers. This includes payments by patients that want to jump the waiting list or to obtain greater quality in the delivery of health care services. They might constitute an essential though informal part of the payment of pro- viders. In the SHA these expenditure should be included in the estimates of overall spending. 5.15. Illegal provision of health care services by unlicensed medical practitioners, on the other hand, and the provision of drugs for illegal purposes ( e.g., sport, body building or drug addiction), although within the production boundaries of SNA, is not considered an ex- penditure on health according to the definition of health care of the SHA. THE TREATMENT OF SUBSIDIES AND OTHER TRANSFERS TO PROVIDER INDUSTRIES 5.16. In actual health delivery and finance, current government transfers and subsidies are fre- quently designed to reduce the prices paid by final consumers or insurance funds for cer- tain goods or services (especially of institutionalised care). These government transfers have two different forms, according to whether they are paid to market or non-market producers in health care. Transfers to market producers are identical to the category of \"subsidies \" in national accounting, in so much as subsidies can only occur in market pro- duction. In many countries, however, subsidies for market production in health are only of minor importance compared with transfers that go to non-market producers. These are recorded under \"current transfers \". In its Chapter XI on satellite accounts, the SNA 93\u00a9 OECD 2000 615. M EASUREMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH CARE lists two options for reporting on subsidies: \"In the central framework, when these goods and services are considered market prod- ucts, they are included in final consumption at purchasers ' prices. In a satellite account there are two options: either consumption is valued differently from the central frame- work in order to include the value of consumption subsidies or consumption is valued as it is in the central framework and specific current transfers must include consumption subsidies. This may also include other subsidies on production. \" (SNA 93, para. 21.75) 5.17. The SHA abides by the first option. Final consumption values of, for instance, hospital services should be recalculated (whenever possible) by adding subsidies to the recorded costs. This solution provides for a uniform treatment of national totals and for functional and institutional breakdowns, when shares in total expenditure on health are compared across countries. The exclusion of subsidies could lead to distortions in cross-country compari- sons. In practice, subsidies for health care are almost exclusively related to in-patient care. 5.18. Subsidies are current unrequited payments that government units make to enterprises on the basis of the levels of their production activities or the quantities or values of the goods or services which they produce, sell or import (SNA 93, para. 7.71). Subsidies on prod- ucts (payable per unit of good or service) should be distinguished from other subsidies on production (not calculated per unit of good or services) often taking the form of regular transfers paid to cover persistent losses. It is important to recall that \"Subsidies... do not include grants that governments may make to enterprises in order to finance their capital formation, ...such grants being treated as capital transfers \" (SNA 93, para. 7.72). 5.19. Current transfers to public corporations and quasi-corporations operating in health care are a common form of financing in many countries, particularly for public hospitals. These consist of regular transfers intended to compensate persistent losses as a result of charging prices which are lower than their average costs of production as a matter of deliberate government economic and social policy. In order to calculate the basic prices of the output of such enterprises, it will usually be necessary to assume a uniform ad valorem implicit rate of subsidy on those outputs determined by the size of the subsidy as a percentage of the value of sales plus subsidy (SNA 93, para. 7.78). THE MEASUREMENT OF OUTPUT : MARKET AND NON-MARKET PRODUCTION 5.20. Differences across countries in the way non-market production of health care services are mea- sured in National Health Accounts can limit the international comparability of health expendi- ture estimates. A pure cash-flow approach does not lead to comparable accounts due to differences in the organisation of health care systems and differences in administrative accounting systems. 5.21. Therefore, the SHA recommend that the SNA principles of measurement of output of health care services are followed. The SNA concepts of output and intermediate consump- tion are applied analogously in calculating national expenditure on health in the SHA. The expenditure on health care services that are provided by non-market producers to house-A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 62holds free of charge or at prices that cover only part of their production costs may be under- estimated in existing National Health Accounts. This separation of output into market and non-market output is used in health accounting only as a technical concept for valuing output of health care services correctly in monetary terms. It is not shown as a separate item in the standard tables proposed for the SHA. For the internal estimation process, separate accounts for non-market and for market production will be an essential tool. The valuation of non-market production 5.22. The valuation of non-market production requires special attention. There are no markets for a range of collective public health services and personal health care services provided to individual households as benefits in kind (with or without patients ' cost-sharing) and there are consequently no suitable prices available (SNA 93, para. 6.90). 5.23. The same or very similar services may be produced on a market basis also and sold alongside non-market services. But there may be important differences between the types and quality of services provided. In most cases, it is not possible to find enough market services that are sufficiently similar to the corresponding non-market services to enable their prices to be used to value the latter, especially when the non-market services are produced in very large quantities. 5.24. For these reasons, and also to ensure that the various non-market services produced by government units and NPISHs are valued consistently with each other, they are all valued by the sum of the costs incurred in their production: that is, by the sum employees; \u007fconsumption of capital; \u007fother taxes, less subsidies, on production. 5.25. The net operating surplus on the production of non-market goods or services produced by government units and NPISHs is always assumed to be zero. Following the SNA conven- tions, separate establishments should be distinguished for market and non-market produc- tion whenever possible. For many establishments ( e.g., offices of physicians working both for private patients and under contract with social insurance) this may not be feasible. 5.26. The output of retailers is measured by the total value of the trade margins realised on the goods they purchase for resale (valued at actual prices). The calculation of the output of insurance enterprises is more complicated and the corresponding accounting rules have not been reproduced here (see SNA 93, para. 6.135). FOREIGN TRADE 5.27. International trade in health care services is increasing, a trend fostered by economic inte- gration (for example in NAFTA and in EU) in the OECD area and by emerging export\u00a9 OECD 2000 635. M EASUREMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH CARE markets in health care of OECD and non-OECD countries. However, in practice, trade in health care services is seldom taken into account in National Health Accounts due to the absence of national statistics on the trade in health care services. It would be desirable that countries introduce survey instruments for covering trade in health care services. 5.28. Two items of foreign trade are relevant candidates for reporting in the SHA: \u007fforeign trade in medical goods and services for final use (such as health care and phar- maceuticals purchased by tourists or patients seeking specialised care); \u007fforeign trade in capital formation in health care industries and health insurance; 5.29. T wo further items would be relevant for monitoring the effect of trade in medical goods (intermediate products) which enter into the production of health care services in countries: \u007fforeign trade in medical-technical goods for gross capital formation in health care industries; \u007fforeign trade in medical-technical goods for intermediate consumption of health care providers. 5.30. For the last two items, industrial statistics and trade statistics provide estimates according to Statistical International T rade Classification (SITC) categories. For the first two items export values for health care services are not regularly reported or corresponding items are set to equal zero in trade statistics of most countries. As has already been mentioned above,this state of play in trade statistics contrasts with an increasing flow of trade in health care services among OECD countries as well as between OECD and non-OECD countries. 5.31. T rade in health care services is reported under the categories of the Balance of Payments Manual (IMF, 1993) and the draft International Trade-in-Service Classifications and Codes (see Table 5.2). Health-related personal travel 5.32. Personal travel is subdivided into health-related travel, education-related travel and other personal travel. For health-related travel, the following definition is provided: \"Health-related expenditure comprises expenditure exclusively on health services ratherTable 5.2. International trade in health care services Component Examples 2 Travel 2.2 Personal travel2.2.1 Health-related travel Health spas, and other travel for specialised health care; all kinds of health expenditure by travellers travelling for otherthan health care purposes 5 Insurance services5.3 Other direct insurance of which : health insurance services Private health insurance 11 Government services n.e.c Transfers of bilateral and international aid in health care Source: Adapted from Eurostat/IMF/OECD/UN/WTO (1999).A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 64than all expenditure by those who travel for health reasons. Health-related travel covers all expenditure by medical patients; World Trade Organisation requests to identify the part of total outlays that represent medical care expenses, such as hospital charges, treat- ments and physicians ' fees; Included are all expenditure on health care services and goods, irrespective of whether the primary purpose of the travel was health-related or not. \" Private health insurance services 5.33. This item encompasses the provision of health insurance to non-residents by resident in- surance companies, and vice-versa. It includes agent commissions related to insurance. Insurance services are estimated or valued by service charges included in total premiums earned rather than by total premiums. Gross premiums and gross claims are recorded as memorandum items (IMF , 1993, Chapter XIII). 5.34. The monitoring of trade in services suggests that countries should co-ordinate their national surveys and develop administrative data to shed more light on flows in health care services. TIME OF RECORDING AND THE ACCRUAL PRINCIPLE 5.35. Cash accounting, which is still applied in health accounts in some countries, records only cash payments and records them at the time these payments occur. It is now widely recognised that recording on a cash basis can lead to a distorted picture when, e.g., budget negotiations and health reform measures have significant spillover effects from one fiscal year to the next. Cash accounting is in many instances not compatible with the recording of non-monetary flows and with overall economic statistics. 5.36. The SHA recommends for these reasons that all monetary flows are recorded on an accrual basis according to the following SNA 93 definition. The accounting period is the calendar year. \"Accrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, trans- formed, exchanged, transferred or extinguished. This means that flows which im- ply a change of ownership are entered when ownership passes, services are recorded when provided, output at the time products are created and intermediate con- sumption when materials and supplies are being used. \" (SNA 93, 3.94) CAPITAL FORMATION IN HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INDUSTRIES 5.37. For the recording of gross capital formation, the SHA recommends that the retail sale of medical goods can be regarded as a supporting activity to health care and will therefore not be counted under total capital formation of health care providers. The items in the ICHA- HP provider classification on the one-digit level provide sub-totals for the various indus- tries of health care. From the list of items on two-digit level provided, it is obvious that it may be difficult to obtain estimates for certain items, especially in out-patient care and for\u00a9 OECD 2000 655. M EASUREMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH CARE institutions active in retail sales. Where functions of administration in public health and health care funding are embedded into larger institutional units, part of gross capital for- mation will go unrecorded. The fundamental definition is: Total gross capital formation in health care industries = sum of gross capital formation in the institutional units listed under the ICHA-HP classification items HP .1 to HP .3, HP .5 and HP .6, where health care is the predominant activity. Separate estimates should be provided for public and private ownership. 5.38. An alternative for aiming at a complete coverage of the ICHA-HP in investment surveys for international comparisons would be the definition of a sub-aggregate for the sum of institutions under HP .1 to HP .3 (roughly corresponding to ISIC Section N \"Health and Social Work \"). Fac- tor cost estimates of gross capital formation and capital stock are, however, required for non- market producers in public administration and insurance, in order to calculate capital consumption, which in turn is necessary for calculating the production value of non-market producers. DEFINITION OF COMPONENTS OF TOTAL EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH IN SNA TERMS: A SUMMARY 5.39. The identities provided in Table 5.3 show the link between the various definitions used in OECD Health Data and SNA definitions. These identities also serve to show overlap as Table 5.3.

This mapping of SHA expenditure aggregates to expenditure in SNA terms also links to the discussion of health care financing in Chapter 6. EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH -RELATED FUNCTIONS 5.40. Health-related functions are overlapping areas with other fields of study, such as educa- tion, overall social expenditure, and R&D. As a general recommendation, the underlying principles and estimation strategies applied in international data collections in these fields and documented in the relevant statistical guidelines should be taken as starting point for the standard Table 4 of the SHA which shows various expenditure aggregates including health-related functions. Education and training of health personnel 5.41. Estimation strategies for expenditure on education and training of health personnel in general are provided in the UNESCO/OECD/Eurostat (1995) guidelines. For education and training, similar problems of double-counting are encountered whenever national totals of expenditure on health are calculated including education and training. A separate reporting constitutes an adequate way of handling the question. Research and development in health 5.42. The Frascati Manual (OECD, 1994 d) provides detailed guidelines for the estimation of expenditure on research and development that are also deemed appropriate for R&D in health according to the functional boundaries described in Chapter 9. Where R&D is an ancillary activity in medical industries that cannot be assigned to a separate institutional unit of homogenous production, a serious double-counting problem arises from the defi- nition of national totals on expenditure in health accounting that adds R&D to health care services and goods. The separate recording of expenditure on R&D as a memorandum item \"below the line \" is suggested. Health-related cash benefits 5.43. Expenditure on health-related cash benefits are distinct from any of the expenditure cat- egories above, both by their economic nature (transfer payments) and by their goal (in- come protection) which is essentially an income maintenance function and not a health care activity. Whenever cash benefits are included in total expenditure on health (in the case of paid household production as described above), it is recommended that this be explicitly identified.\u00a9 OECD 2000 676. HEALTH CARE FUNDING INTRODUCTION 6.1. Regulations of health care financing are becoming increasingly complex in many OECD coun- tries with a wide range of institutions involved. The financing of health care is one of the report- ing dimensions present in standard tables of most National Health Accounts. At least a basic subdivision of public and private financing is reported in many cases. A detailed breakdown of expenditure on health by sources of funding is an essential component of a comprehensive SHA. 6.2. National systems of flows of financing in health care tend to be fairly complex and the level of standardisation across countries of even the basic categories of public and private funding is in general low. As with other aspects of health care (activities, providers), similar designations of \"social insurance \", \"mutualit \u00e9s\", \"friendly societies \", etc., often describe different institutional arrangements and financing regulations. In addition, country specific forms of inter- governmental transfers as well as transfers in the private sector between public and private funds increase the complexity of reporting on sources of funding in international comparisons. 6.3. This chapter provides a toolbox for standard reporting on health spending by sources of fund- ing. A set of sectoral flow-of-funding accounts is proposed for creating a core set of accounts that could serve as a model for comprehensive accounts for health care financing as part of National Health Accounts. For international comparisons, data collection will have to focus on the corresponding set of balancing items and some of the major components of financing flows. To keep the illustrative example and the set of accounts that are discussed in the chapter simple, the presentation is limited to an analysis of current expenditure on health. The com- plex issue of accounts for capital formation and its financing is not part of this manual. A toolbox of SNA definitions and sectoral accounts 6.4. The SHA proposes in this chapter a toolbox for defining institutional sectors of health care funds as well as of flows of funding. The proposed framework is an adoption of SNA 93A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 68definitions which in many instances could be taken verbally to serve the purposes of the SHA. This chapter also draws on those sections of the SNA 93 chapter on health satellite accounts, which provide a rough sketch on a breakdown by sources of funding in function- ally defined satellite accounts (SNA 93, 21.87 - 21.91; see also Chapter 8 of this manual); and on the Annex IV of the SNA 93 on the treatment of insurance and social insurance. 6.5. A rich and detailed set of SNA-descriptions of concepts, definitions of terms, and accounting rules exists for the classification of contributions to social insurance funds, taxes, and transfers which are used here to distinguish between types of health and other insurance programmes. 6.6. The SHA recommends the use of these international standards in reporting on flows of financing in health care. Some modifications which correspond to a slightly different treat- ment of the production boundary and of tax deductions in the SHA compared to the SNA, are explained. The ICHA-HF classification of sources of funding 6.7. The financing classification of the ICHA presented in Table 6.1 provides a complete break- down of health expenditure into public and private units incurring expenditure on health. This classification is derived from the central SNA framework of institutional sectors of the economy (see Table 4.2 in Chapter 4). The different role of social security, private social insurance and other insurance enterprises is sketched below and in Chapter 11 of this manual. Table 6.1.

H EALTH CARE FUNDING Two perspectives on health care financing 6.8. Basically, health care financing can be recorded from two different perspectives: \u007fThe first perspective, commonly used in National Health Accounts, aims at a break- down of expenditure on health into the complex range of third-party-payment ar- rangements plus the direct payments by households or other direct funders of, e.g., government provided health care. \u007fThe second perspective asks for the ultimate burden of financing born by sources of funding. In this kind of analysis, the sources of financing of the intermediary sources of funding (social security funds; private social and other private insurance; NPISHs) are traced back to their origin. Additional transfers such as inter-governmental trans- fers, tax deductions; subsidies to providers; and financing by the rest of the world are included to complete the picture. OVERVIEW ON HEALTH CARE FINANCING : AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE 6.9. The analysis of a system of financing units, transfers and related expenditure categories, is illustrated in this chapter by the numerical example of a model health care system. Al- though many simplifications have been introduced, this example is believed to be suffi- ciently complex to cover the most important flows of financing in current expenditure on health for a wide range of countries. 6.10. The health care system under study is a mixed system including all of the common forms of public and private financing. In the example economy, health care is financed by social insur- ance (social security and private social insurance), by tax financed direct government provision of health care services, and various private arrangements (private insurance plus tax deduction; non-profit charities). Private out-of-pocket payments include a range of cost-sharing items that correspond to the various third-party-payment arrangements. Employers provide occu- pational health care and other direct health care. There is a net support of the nation 's health care system by foreign funds, mainly provided by international co-operation and aid. 6.11. In order not to overburden the presentation, this chapter focuses on flows of financing for current expenditure on health care goods and services. Flows of financing are broken down by sector and sub-sector as shown in Table 6.2. Besides social security, only two levels of government are distinguished: central government on the one hand and regional/ local government on the other. Extending this example to three levels of government: central, state, and local, is a straightforward exercise. 6.12. Table 6.2 summarises the breakdown of funding by public and private funds according to the two alternative views described below: funding as direct payment (out-of-pocket or as third-party-payment); funding as net balance of own resources devoted by each sector on the financing of health care.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 70Table 6.2.

H EALTH CARE FUNDING 6.13. The SNA codes refer to the explanations given in Annex 6.1. Numerical values could be read as million National Currency Units (NCU). The numerical health care system de- scribed would fit into the numerical example economy used for illustrative purposes in the SNA 93 manual. T otal current expenditure on health of 1428 million NCU would corre- spond to some 8% of GDP in the SNA 93 example, if all values in the central framework were multiplied by ten. OVERVIEW ON THE SECTORS OF SOURCES OF FUNDING 6.14. This section provides summary descriptions of the role of the various sectors in health care financing in the sample health care system, although, in various individual countries, not all elements might be present. However, it is suggested that the major elements that can be found in most countries are covered. The model should, in this respect, apply both to the situation in OECD countries and other high-income countries as well as to middle and low-income countries. 6.15. Table 6.2 presents a summary description of the flow of funds analysis in matrix form given in Table 6.3. All entries in Table 6.2 are derived from Table 6.3 by rearranging the margins under the given SNA-codes of flows. Private household out-of-pocket expendi- ture is a residual value after all other funding components have been subtracted from actual private final consumption. Out-of-pocket spendings consequently exclude private insurance claims and service charges paid to private insurance companies. Out-of-pocket spending is recorded net in Table 6.2 in the sense that tax deductions have been sub- tracted. Out-of-pocket expenditure are the sum of co-payment to the various insurance funds present in the health care system and of over-the-counter (and other direct) pay- ments for goods and services purchased by private households as direct and ultimate payer. Central government (G.1) 6.16. As a direct financer, this sector is mainly financing health care administration (recorded under actual collective consumption) and other direct provision of health care (other so- cial benefits and social transfers in kind). The role of central government as direct finan- cier of health care is shown in Table 6.2 net of tax deductions granted to private household for private health insurance and private consumption of health, i.e., these tax deductions are included under government. The net financing balance of central government is sub- stantially higher than its direct financing due to transfers paid to the other financing sec- tors, where the bulk is for social security funds and other inter-governmental transfers. Regional and local government (G.2) 6.17. This sector has, besides health administration and public health, a somewhat more impor- tant role in providing tax financed health care services (social transfers in kind). In addi- tion, regional/local government grants substantial subsidies to private market producers ofA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 72health care. The net financing balance of this sector is higher than its direct financing, due to the same type of inter-governmental transfers described above for central government. Social security funds (G.3) 6.18. The sector of social security funds is a typical intermediary funder of health care. In the sample economy chosen, this sector is the biggest single direct funder of health care ser- vices (social transfers in kind to private households, either as remuneration or direct provi- sion of services purchased by health care providers). Social security funds spend part of their resources on administration (as actual collective consumption). The net balance of own resources is very small, and would typically be financed out of interest received on assets accumulated in the past. Private social insurance (P.1) 6.19. The sectoral account for private social insurance is similar to that of social security funds. Private social insurance is an intermediary financier of health care funded out of social contributions and, to a minor degree, by other current transfers. Benefits pro- vided by this sector are recorded correspondingly under private funded social benefits. A social insurance programme is one where the policyholder is obliged or encouraged by the intervention of a third party but which is - unlike social security funds - not under the direct control of general government (see the explanatory notes in Chapter 11 for more detail). Private insurance enterprises (other than social insurance) (P.2) 6.20. Private insurance enterprises (other than social insurance) are treated differently in the account. There are two parts in private consumption expenditure on health which corre- spond to private insurance: net insurance claims and net service charges (Table 6.2). In the proposed SNA 93 framework of sectoral accounts, only insurance claims show up explic- itly. The treatment of private insurance enterprises is therefore simple: net insurance claims and net insurance premiums equal each other. It should be noted that both claims and premiums have non-zero items in the rest of the world account. Private households (P.3) 6.21. Direct financing by private households consists of out-of-pocket spending, which is a re- sidual after all other private third-party payments have been deducted from total private financing. Out-of-pocket spending can be estimated gross or net of tax deductions granted by government. A component of out-pocket payment, which is particularly important to the health policy analysis of third-party-payment arrangements, is co-payment for benefits received by these various sources of funding. The SHA recommends giving these items special attention in the construction of National Health Accounts.\u00a9 OECD 2000 736. H EALTH CARE FUNDING Non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) (other than social insurance) (P.4) 6.22. The sector of non-profit institutions serving households (other than social insurance) typically brings together a range of heterogeneous institutions. An important role might be played by charities that provide health services for free (recorded under other current transfers, not as social benefits). They are financed by transfers from private households and enterprises, and might get additional funding from government and/or from the rest of the world. Enterprises (other than health insurance) (P .5) 6.23. The other corporations sector mainly contributes to health care financing as a producer of occupational health care services. Employers ' social contributions are considered part of household income and consequently as private household funding of health care, not as funding by enterprises. Rest of the world (ROW) 6.24. The rest of the world contributes indirectly to the financing of health care in the example of a typical model economy, as international aid and other flows are usually channelled via government or NPISHs agencies. THE SYSTEM OF TRANSFERS CHARACTERISTIC FOR HEALTH CARE: A MATRIX PRESENTATION 6.25. Table 6.3 shows the link between the direct financing and the balancing item of net fi- nancing out of own resources by sector of financing fund. This matrix presentation pro- vides a summary view on the sectoral accounts presented in Annex 6.1. The balancing item of resident sectors ' accounts (B.2) measures the sectors ' ultimate funding of current expenditure on health care as net financing out of own resources. The balancing item of the rest of the world account shows the ultimate financing of residents ' current expendi- ture on health care by non-resident units. 6.26. The algebraic sum of residents ' flow-of-funding accounts measures total domestic cur- rent expenditure on health care or total current expenditure on health care by resident units. By deduction from this aggregate the balancing item of the rest of the world 's account measures national current expenditure of resident units on health care financed by resident units. 6.27. As has been mentioned above, capital expenditure on health care (gross capital formation) by market and non-market providers of health care services and financing of fixed capital formation by way of savings, loans, capital transfers from resident or non-resident units are excluded from Table 6.3 and from the flow-of-funding accounts in this chapter which only deals with current expenditure and its financing.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 74Table 6.3.

The flows-of-funding accounts of health care presented in Table 6.3 derive the necessary information from the following sequence of standard non-financial accounts of the SNA: \u007fthe production account (intermediate consumption of occupational health care serv- ices, analysed here as an output of non-market occupational health care services by employers, therefore somewhat extending the SNA 93 production boundary); \u007fthe secondary distribution of income account (social contributions, social benefits and transfers, other transfers); \u007fthe use of disposable income account (individual and collective final consumption); \u007fthe rest of the world account (health care flows of financing between resident and non- resident units). FLOWS OF FINANCING : A SET OF SECTORAL ACCOUNTS 6.29. Covering various perspectives of financing in health accounts can best be achieved by sectoral flow-of-financing accounts showing all health-related flows of financing by sector of the economy. The SHA suggests complementing the breakdown of expenditure by source of funding (estimated along the lines of the funding perspective) with a full set of sectoral accounts showing financing flows in some detail, either regularly or for selected years. The purpose of these accounts would be to allow a detailed analysis of health care financing. 6.30. An integral part of the proposed set of accounts is a consolidated and aggregated account for the total economy, providing information on the financing shares of the ultimate bear- ers of expenditure. All flows of financing have been given an exact economic meaning according to SNA 93 standards, in order to get internationally comparable statistics. The accounts given in tables of Annex 6.1 show relevant flows of financing of health care and of expenditure on medical goods and health care services for each one of the following sectors or sub-sectors: \u007fcentral government; than social insurance); \u007fprivate households \u007fnon-profit institutions serving households (other than social insurance); \u007fenterprises (other than health insurance); \u007frest of the world.\u00a9 OECD 2000 776.

It introduces a distinction between the expenditure on consumption goods and services and the acquisition of consumption goods and services for the direct satisfaction of human needs and wants. When consumption is recorded on an expenditure basis, the purpose is to identify the institutional units that incur the expenditure and hence control and finance the amounts of such expenditure. When consump- tion is recorded on an acquisitions basis, the pur- pose is to identify the units that actually acquire the goods and services and benefit from their use. The sum of final consumption expenditure of households, of general government and of NPISHs is equal to the sum of actual individual final consumption and actual collective final con- sumption. Total final consumption is the same whether the expenditure or the acquisition basis is used. The acquisition basis is used here. Actual final consumption may be divided between actual in- dividual final consumption (of households) and actual collective final consumption (of generalgovernment). However, as Table 9.5 in Chapter 9 shows, part of the services that SNA 93 classifies as individual (prevention, public health) are not considered as personal services in the SHA but recorded under HC.6 as collective services. Ex- tensions of the SNA production boundary to in- clude in health expenditure the production of health services by households for own account and occupational health services by enterprises are de- fined in Chapter 5. /c80 /c46 /c52 /c49 /c65/c99/c116/c117/c97/c108/c32/c105/c110/c100/c105/c118/c105/c100/c117/c97/c108/c32/c102/c105/c110/c97/c108/c32/c99/c111/c110/c115/c117/c109/c112/c116/c105/c111/c110It consists of the consumption goods or services acquired by individual households by expenditure or through social transfers in kind received from government units or NPISHs (SNA 93, 9.72). The value of actual individual final consumption is given by the sum of three components: the value of households' expenditure on consump- tion goods and services including expenditure on non-market goods and services sold at prices that are not economically significant; the value of the expenditure incurred by govern- ment units on individual consumption goods or services provided to households as social transfers in kind; the value of the expenditure incurred by NPISHs on individual consumption goods or services pro- vided to households as social transfers in kind.\u00a9 OECD 2000 856. H EALTH CARE FUNDING The values of health expenditure on social trans- fers incurred by government units or NPISHs are equal to imputed values of the goods or services supplied to households less the amounts of any expenditure incurred by households when prices are charged that are not economically significant (SNA 93, 9.73). Expenditure incurred by house- holds to acquire non-market health services pro- duced by government units or NPISHs are included in the first component. Individual goods or services as distinct from \"pub- lic\" goods or services have the following charac- teristics: it must be possible to observe and record theacquisition of the good or service by an indi- vidual household or member thereof and the time at which it took place; the household must have agreed to the provisionof the good or services and take whatever action is necessary - for example going to a hospital; the good or service must be such that its acquisi- tion by one household or person, or possibly by a small, restricted group of persons, precludes its acquisition by any other households or persons. Government units and NPISHs also purchase consumption goods and services produced by market producers and supplied directly to house- holds. The government unit or NPISH pays for the good or service, without engaging in any fur- ther processing of these goods and services, and ensures that they are distributed to households as social transfers in kind and are recorded under social assistance benefits in kind. /c80 /c46 /c52 /c50 /c65/c99/c116/c117/c97/c108/c32/c99/c111/c108/c108/c101/c99/c116/c105/c118 /c101/c32/c102/c105/c110/c97/c108/c32/c99/c111/c110/c115/c117/c109/c112/c116/c105/c111/c110A collective consumption service is a service pro- vided simultaneously to all members of the com- munity or to all members of a particular section of the community, such as all households living in a particular region. Collective services are au-tomatically acquired and consumed by all mem- bers of the community, or group of households, without any action on their part. By their nature, collective services cannot be sold to individuals on the market, and they are financed by govern- ment units out of taxation or other incomes (SNA 93, 9.43). The characteristics of collective services may be summarised as follows: collective services can be distributed simulta-neously to every member of the community, or of particular sections of the community; the use of such services is usually passive anddoes not require the explicit agreement or active participation of all the individuals concerned; the provision of a collective service to one in-dividual does not reduce the amount available to the others in the same community or sec- tion of the community. There is no rivalry in acquisition (SNA 93, 9.83). Actual collective final consumption corresponds to the actual final consumption of government units and is taken to be equal to the value of the expendi- ture they incur on collective services. Although col- lective services benefit the community, or certain section of the community, rather than the govern- ment, the actual consumption of these services can- not be distributed among individual households, or even among groups of households. It is therefore attributed to the same government units that incur the corresponding expenditure. Actual final con- sumption of government units is thus also equal to total final consumption expenditure of government less its expenditure on individual goods or services provided as social transfers in kind to households. Note: Although NPISHs may provide services to groups of their members, the services are essen- tially individual rather than collective. In gen- eral, persons other than their members are excluded and derive no benefit from the services provided.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 86Therefore, all the services provided by NPISHs are by convention treated as individual (SNA 93, 9.85). All the goods and services covered by the final ex- penditure of NPISHs are therefore assumed to be provided to individual households as social trans- fers in kind. Actual collective final consumption here includes only the provision of collective health services such as the maintenance of public health. D.3 Subsidies Subsidies are current unrequited payments that government units make to enterprises on the basis of the levels of their production activities or the quantities or values of the goods or services which they produce, sell or import (SNA 93, 7.71). The SNA distinguishes subsidies on products (payable per unit of good or service) from other subsidies on production (not calculated per unit of good or services) often taking the form of regular transfers paid to cover persistent losses. It is important to recall that \"subsidies do not include grants that governments may make to enterprises in order to finance their capital formation, such grants being treated as capital transfers \" (SNA 93, 7.72). Subsidies consist of regular transfers intended to compensate persistent losses as a result of charging prices which are lower than their average costs of production as a matter of deliberate government economic and social policy. In order to calculate the basic prices of the outputs of such enterprises, it is usually necessary to assume a uniform ad valo- rem implicit rate of subsidy on those outputs de- termined by the size of the subsidy as a percentage of the value of sales plus subsidy (SNA 93, 7.78). Note: All transfers to public corporations and quasi-corporations operating in health care as non- market producers have to be reported under \"Other current transfers \" in the SHA, not under D.31 Subsidies. The term \"subsidy \" applies only to market producers.D.5 Current taxes on income, wealth, etc. /c68 /c46 /c53 /c49 /c84 /c97/c120/c101/c115/c32/c111/c110/c32/c105/c110/c99/c111/c109/c101 This item comprises taxes on incomes, profits and capital gains. They are assessed on the actual or presumed incomes of individuals, households, NPIs or corporations (SNA 93, 8.52). Note: Normally, there are no income taxes \"ear- marked \" for health. Government policy regard- ing income taxed on individual households can, however, indirectly influence household decisions on health care financing, e.g., where tax deduc- tions are granted to private households on private health insurance or direct out-of-pocket payment of health care services. For health policy analysis, this is an important piece of information and has therefore been integrated in the framework illus- trated in Table 6.3. /c68/c46 /c54 /c49 /c83/c111/c99/c105/c97/c108/c32/c99/c111/c110/c116/c114/c105/c98/c117/c116/c105/c111/c110/c115/c32/c102/c111/c114/c32/c104/c101/c97/c108/c116/c104/c32/c98/c101/c110/c101/c102/c105/c116/c115 D.611 Employers ' actual social contributions for health benefits These are social contributions paid by employers to social security funds, insurance enterprises adminis- tering social insurance to secure social benefits for their employees. As employers ' actual social contri- butions are made for the benefit of their employees their value is recorded as one of the components of compensation of employees together with wages and salaries in cash and in kind. The social contribu- tions are then recorded as being paid by the employ- ees as current transfers to the social security funds or insurance enterprises (SNA 93, 8.67). Note: The accounts presented in the chapter use the SNA 93 distinction between employers ' actual so- cial contributions (D.6111); employees ' actual so- cial contributions (D.6112) and social contributions by self- and non-employed persons (D.6113) (see SNA 93, 8.68-9.74 for further explanations).\u00a9 OECD 2000 876. H EALTH CARE FUNDING Although it is administratively more efficient for employers to pay the contributions on behalf of their employees, this must not be allowed to ob- scure the underlying economic reality. The pay- ment made by the employer to the social security fund, insurance enterprise or autonomous pen- sion fund, is not a current transfer by the employer. The transfer takes place between the employee and the social security fund, insurance enterprise or autonomous pension fund out of remuneration provided by the employer. It is customary to de- scribe the employers ' social contributions as be- ing re-routed in the accounts via the employees ' primary and secondary distribution of income accounts (SNA 93, 8.67). For National Health Accounts a further break- down of social contributions for health benefits into compulsory contributions and voluntary con- tributions would be a useful tool. This additional breakdown does not change the basic mechanism of the framework of Table 6.3 and has therefore been omitted in this manual. D.612 Imputed social contributions for health benefits These contributions correspond to social benefits pro- vided directly by employers to their employees with- out creating a special fund (unfunded social insurance). Note: See SNA 93, 8.71-8.74 for detailed account- ing rules and recommendations /c68 /c46 /c54 /c50 /c83/c111/c99/c105/c97/c108/c32/c98/c101/c110/c101/c102/c105/c116/c115/c32/c111/c116/c104/c101/c114/c32/c116/c104/c97/c110/c32/c115/c111/c99/c105/c97/c108 /c116/c114 /c97/c110/c115/c102/c101/c114/c115/c32/c105/c110/c32/c107/c105/c110/c100 This item comprises all health care social benefits that are either in cash or are not provided by so- cial security funds. The SHA follows the SNA 93 recommendation to distinguish between social insurance benefits and social assistance benefits, and between benefits in cash and benefits in kind. The distinction between social security and othersocial insurance is an essential element of the ICHA-HF breakdown of sources of funding. Note: The financial accounts of the SHA in its current version do not include health-related ben- efits in cash such as sickness leave or maternity leave, which would be recorded under the health- related function HC.R.7 and are not included in total current expenditure on health. T wo items under D.62 are therefore relevant for the SHA: social benefits in cash provided to privatehouseholds as a support for home health care, and which can be considered a quasi-payment for corresponding household production; social insurance benefits of health care services and goods provided under private funded and unfunded social insurance to private households. D.621 Social security benefits in cash This item comprises social benefits in cash pro-vided to private households as a support for home health care, and which can be considered a quasi- payment for corresponding household production. Note: Sickness and invalidity benefits, maternity allowances are not recorded under this item as they are not part of the framework of transfers presented in this chapter. D.622 Private funded social benefits These are social insurance benefits of health careservices and goods payable to households by in- surance enterprises or other institutional units administering private funded social insurance (SNA 93, 8.79). Note: Only benefits in kind will be recorded under this item. Reimbursements for employees ' outlays on health care services should be treated in the SHA as benefits in kind, analogous to the treatment of social security benefits, reimbursements.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 88D.623 Unfunded employee social benefits These are social benefits of health care services or goods provided by employers to their employees or their dependants by employers administering unfunded social insurance (SNA 93, 8.80). Note: Only general medical services not related to the employee 's work are included here. Services of occupational health care are recorded in the SHA under D.75 \"Other current transfers \". Only benefits in kind will be recorded under this item. Reimbursements for employees ' outlays on health care services, however, should be treated in the SHA as benefits in kind, analogous to the treatment of social security benefits, reimbursements in the SNA. D.624 Social assistance benefits in cash Social assistance benefits are current transfers pay-able to households by government units or NPISHs to meet the same needs as social insur- ance benefits but which are not made under a so- cial insurance programme incorporating social contributions and social insurance benefits (SNA 93, 8.81-8.83). Note: Examples are health care services reimburse- ments that are provided to persons which do not participate and are not eligible for the correspond- ing health care benefits under social insurance pro- grammes. Included are additional benefits in certain instances for persons with partial coverage under social health care insurance. /c68 /c46 /c54 /c51 /c83/c111/c99/c105/c97/c108/c32/c116/c114 /c97/c110/c115/c102/c101/c114/c115/c32/c105/c110/c32/c107/c105/c110/c100 D.631 Social benefits in kind These consist of individual goods and services pro- vided as transfers in kind to individual households by government units (including social security funds) and NPISHs, whether purchased on the market or produced as non-market output by gov- ernment units or NPISHs. They may be financedout of taxation, other government income or social security contributions, or out of donations and prop- erty income in the case of NPISHs (SNA 93, 8.99). Note: If it is not possible to segregate the accounts of social security funds from those of other sub- sectors of government, it may be impossible to divide social benefits into those provided by so- cial security and others. Social security benefits in kind are subdivided into two types: those where beneficiary households actually purchase the goods or services themselves and are then reimbursed, and those where the relevant services are provided directly to the beneficiaries (SNA 93, 8.99). D.6311 Social security benefits, reimbursements The reimbursement by social security funds ofapproved expenditure made by households on specified goods or services is a form of social ben- efit in kind (SNA 93, 8.101). Note: Examples of expenditure that may be reim- bursable are expenditure on medicines, medical or dental treatments, hospital bills, optometrists ' bills, etc. The amount of the expenditure reim- bursed is recorded as being incurred directly by the social security fund at the time the household makes the purchase, while the only expenditure recorded for the household is the difference, if any, between the purchaser 's price paid and the amount reimbursed. Thus, the amount of the expenditure reimbursed is not treated as a current transfer in cash from the social security fund to households. D.6312 Other social security benefits in kind These consist of social transfers in kind, exceptreimbursements, made by social security funds to households (SNA 93, 8.103). Note: Most of these are likely to consist of medi- cal or dental treatments, surgery, hospital accom- modation, spectacles or contact lenses, medical appliances or equipment, and similar goods or\u00a9 OECD 2000 896. H EALTH CARE FUNDING services associated with the provision of health care. The services may be provided by market or non-market producers and should be valued ac- cordingly. In both cases any nominal payments made by the householders themselves should be deducted (SNA 93, 8.103). D.6313 Social assistance benefits in kind Note: These consist of transfers in kind providedto households by government units or NPISHs that are similar in nature to social security ben- efits in kind but are not provided in the context of social insurance (SNA 93, 8.104). D.632 Transfers of individual non-market goods and services These consist of individual health care services and goods provided to private households free, or at prices which are not economically significant, by non-mar- ket producers of government units or NPISHs. Al- though some of the non-market services (in health) produced by NPISHs have some of the characteristics of collective services, all the non-market services pro- duced by NPISHs are, for simplicity and by conven- tion, treated as individual in nature (SNA 93, 8.105). Note: Additional item to D.63: transfer of non-mar- ket occupational health services. These consist of occupational health services provided by employers to employees, free of charge. In the central system of SNA 93 they are accounted for as an internal in- termediate consumption. For the purpose of a health satellite account, they are externalised and consid- ered as a non-market output by employers and are included in households ' actual final consumption.

Note: Accident insurance claims should be in- cluded by the share of an insurance corporation 's activities (insurance claims) that cover expendi- ture on health care services and goods. /c68 /c46/c55/c51 /c67/c117/c114/c114 /c101/c110/c116/c32/c116/c114/c97/c110/c115/c102/c101/c114/c115/c32/c119/c105/c116/c104/c105/c110/c32/c103/c111/c118 /c101/c114/c110/c109/c101/c110/c116 These consist of current transfers between differ- ent government units or different sub-sectors of general government. They include current trans- fers between different levels of government, such as frequently occur between central and state or local government units, and between government units and social security funds. They do not in- clude transfers of funds committed to finance gross fixed capital formation, such transfers being treated as capital transfers (SNA 93, 8.90). Note: These transfers can play an important role in health care financing. Their exact treatment so that they fit into the health accounting framework depends on the level of detail that is aimed at. The framework in Table 6.3 provides an example of a small country with two levels of government: central government and local government. /c68 /c46 /c55 /c52 /c67/c117/c114/c114/c101/c110/c116/c32/c105/c110/c116/c101/c114/c110/c97/c116/c105/c111/c110/c97/c108/c32/c99/c111/c45/c111/c112/c101/c114/c97/c116/c105/c111/c110 Current international co-operation consists of cur- rent transfers in cash or in kind between the govern- ments of different countries or between governments and international organisations (SNA 93, 8.92).A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 90Note: This includes transfers in kind in the form of medicines and the direct provision of health care ser- vices in a foreign country under, e.g., international aid.

Some of the more important are shown below (SNA 93, 8.93). Provision of occupational health care In accordance with the change of the productionboundary of the SHA to include occupational health care in total current expenditure on health, the SHA includes occupational health care pro- vided by employers under this item. Current transfers to NPISHs These are transfers in cash or kind received byNPISHs from other resident or non-resident in- stitutional units in the form of membership dues, subscription, voluntary donations, etc., whether made on a regular or occasional basis. Such trans- fers are intended to cover the costs of non-market production of NPISHs or to provide the funds out of which current transfers may be made to resident or non-resident households in the form of social assistance benefits of health care services and goods. This includes transfers in kind in the form of gifts of medicine, etc., to charities for dis- tribution to resident or non-resident households (SNA 93, 8.94). Payments of compensation These consist of current transfers paid by institu-tional units to other institutional units in com- pensation for injury to persons or damage to property caused by the former, excluding paymentsof non-life insurance claims. Payments of com- pensation could be either compulsory payments awarded by courts of law, or ex gratia payments agreed out of court (SNA 93, 8.98). Note: This heading covers only compensation for injuries or damages caused by other institutional units. It also covers ex gratia payments made by government units or NPISHs in compensation for injuries or damages caused by natural disasters. Other transfers related to health care This list of transfers complement the toolbox pre-sented here and could enter into more elaborate accounts. The recording of items, like taxes on products that are \"earmarked \" for health might give useful information for health policy analy- sis. They would fit into the system of financial accounts of Table 6.3 under various balancing items and could be recorded correspondingly as memorandum items. For example, federal taxes \"earmarked \" for health such as certain taxes on alcohol or tobacco could be shown as memorandum item under correspond- ing transfers, e.g., from general government to so- cial security funds, if there is an explicit or implicit rule that these taxes should be used for financing social security funds. It is, however, important to understand that these additional items, though potentially influencing the behaviour of actors in the health care system, do not change the balanc- ing items as they are defined here (Table 6.3 and the sector accounts in this annex).\u00a9 OECD 2000 917. PRICE AND VOLUME MEASUREMENT INTRODUCTION 7.1. There is growing concern among policy-makers and statisticians that the difficult task of price and volume measurement in health care services needs more attention and that a greater share of statistical resources should be devoted to this task. Reported time series on health care prices are seriously deficient in many instances. 7.2. Health care has basic conceptual difficulties of price and volume measurement in com- mon with other service industries, for instance, communication, computer and infor- mation services. The difficulties in price and volume measurement in health care are partly due to well-known fundamental measurement problems in service industries such as the definition of output, the appropriate choice of unit of measurement, and the monitoring of quality changes. Evidence from a number of recent studies suggests that substantial quality improvements in health care over the last two decades have been seriously underreported in real volume measurement [ e.g., Cutler, et al. (1996), Frank, et al. (1998)]. 7.3. This chapter discusses some of the problems of current calculations of constant-price out- put of health care industries - services and goods - both for market and non-market pro- duction and comments on methodological problems of international price comparisons in this field. This chapter will skip the more technical parts of index numbers and concen- trate on proposals of how to improve surveys on price and volume changes in health care services [see OECD (1996 e) for a comprehensive review of various methods currently used for price measurement in health care services in OECD countries]. 7.4. The chapter generalises methods that have been tested in several OECD countries which have launched projects to improve their countries ' price and output measure- ment in health care industries, mainly by using directly measured output indicators. Results from these studies indicate that health care is an area where improved indica-A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 92tors for price and output measurement are feasible where elaborate health information systems are in place. THE ROLE OF VOLUME AND PRICE MEASUREMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES 7.5. In many OECD countries, reported prices for health care services and goods have in- creased more rapidly than the price of other goods and services over the past two decades. In some instances, this excess of health care price inflation over the GDP deflator was an important argument underlying policies of budgeting or direct price control. Commonly used forecasting models of health expenditure for medium-term budgeting and planning usually have at their core a fundamental decomposition of expenditure growth into a vol- ume and a price component. 7.6. The study of long-term impacts of health care services on the growth of service indus- tries, overall economic productivity trends and relative prices also depends on the avail- ability of reliable measures for price and volume in health care services and goods. Weaknesses in price and volume measurement of health care services have implications for the measurement of total GDP growth in real terms. Growth of real private house- hold income might also be underestimated in countries where health care is an impor- tant component in the consumer price index (see Boskin et al. , 1996, for the USA). With some countries further advanced than others in replacing traditional price and volume estimates by new approaches, it may even be more difficult to compare pro- ductivity trends across countries. MEASUREMENT OF CHANGES IN PRICE AND VOLUME IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SHA 7.7. Measurement of changes in price and volume can be analysed in the System of Health Accounts from two different perspectives depending on whether the primary aim is to measure changes in the volume of output or changes in purchasing power over some bas- ket of final consumption goods and services. 7.8. For the first type of analysis, the System of National Accounts suggests a framework for compiling a consistent and integrated set of price and volume measures covering all flows of goods and services, as recorded in the supply and use tables (see Chapter 8, Tables 8.2 and 8.3 which cover the production and use side of health care within the total economy). For price and volume measurement, the production side of health care industries can be broken down into the categories shown in Table 7.1 according to major ICHA-HP (health care provider classification) categories with cross-reference to corresponding ISIC catego- ries (see Chapters 4 and 10 for more detailed definitions of health care industries). 7.9. A second set of volume and price statistics for health care service industries contains \"free standing \" indices, such as consumer price indices. However, in this chapter it will be argued that the basic estimation strategies outlined below for measuring producer prices of\u00a9 OECD 2000 937. P RICE AND VOLUME MEASUREMENT Table 7.1.

CURRENT SITUATION OF PRICE AND VOLUME MEASUREMENT 7.10. For market production in health the major problems and shortcomings of price measurement are: fragmentation of services into units of measurement that are of an input rather than an output type; examples are bed days in hospitals, fees for selected procedures that con- stitute only part of medical treatment; use of regulated or administrated prices from fee-for-service lists for selected procedures; distorted and volatile price movements are a frequent consequence of physicians per- forming more procedures to achieve similar medical results in order to obtain increased income under regulated prices, resulting in underestimation of actual price increases; inadequate treatment of cost-sharing arrangements of, e.g., pharmaceuticals; relatively small baskets for the coverage of core health care services; inadequate surveys for determining weighting schemes; inadequate capturing of technological and therapeutical advances and outdated baskets of services ; use of crude output measures such as number of visits to physicians, bed days. 7.11. For non-market production traditionally used estimation strategies focused on the follow- ing methods: the use of input or input price indicators as proxies for output (numbers employed,hours worked; wage indices; with/or without additional exogenous assumptions aboutA OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 94labour productivity trends); the use of composite indexes (mix of input and output indicators); the use of relevant CPI components for the deflation of non-market services. PRICE AND OUTPUT MEASUREMENT FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES : A PROPOSED STRATEGY 7.12. There is an emerging consensus that the use of input indicator methods is inadequate for price and volume measurement in non-market production of health care services. Indirect price measurement by constructing output indicators for volume measurement is seen as superior by researchers and statisticians in a growing number of countries. Consequently, this section focuses on suggestions for appropriate units of output for volume measure- ment. The following remarks on the definition of units of output are also relevant for the construction of price indices for market production. Definition of the units of measurement 7.13. Fragmentation of services in the definition of output of health care has to be avoided. Instead, bundles of services that together constitute the treatment of an episode of illness can lead to more homogenous units of output that are better capable of tracking actual cost per treatment which, over time, may consist of a rapidly changing mix of services fostered by technological advances. 7.14. The cost-per-episode of illness approach has long been suggested as an alternative to tradi- tional health care price indexes (Scitovski, 1967). Trial implementations along these lines show promising results (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1997; and van T uinen et al., 1997). The further spread of this approach depends on the availability of case-based reporting systems, and on the integration of health care statistics into consistent and comprehensive information systems linking patient data with cost estimates. 7.15. Defining the treatment of an episode of illness as a statistical measurement unit has to take various parameters into account with the need for standard classification systems and pa- tient information systems: the nature of the patient 's underlying disorder (disease or impairment); the severity of cases (with/without complication); the patient 's age and gender; the commonly performed interventions, resources and technology used ( e.g., type of surgery, physician 's consultation, obstetric procedures, laboratory, etc.). 7.16. Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) systems have been taken as the starting point for im- proved output indicators of non-market in-patient care in several recent pilot implemen- tations (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1997). There is a case for using prices for similarly defined bundles of services on the basis of correspondingly defined units of output and also for direct price measurement in market services.\u00a9 OECD 2000 957. P RICE AND VOLUME MEASUREMENT 7.17. The majority of recent proposals for improving the methodological underpinnings of health care price and volume indexes have concentrated on the production of hospitals, ambula- tory care and medical goods. Hospital care 7.18. For non-market production, treatment episodes as defined by DRG provide rela- tively uniform units of output for price and volume measurement. Unresolved ques- tions pertain mainly to changes in quality over time. With a secular shift of treatment from hospital care towards ambulatory care, the remaining case-mix might consist of cases with increasing resource demands over time for all DRGs. Technological progress - especially in diagnostic procedures - can act in both ways. There may be increased numbers of cases detected at an early disease stage, thus reducing the aver- age severity of cases, or, a more efficient pre-selecting of cases for non-hospital treat- ment might take place. This would leave a case-mix for hospital care that is more resource demanding. 7.19. Generally speaking, a basic problem of accurate price and volume measurement in health care is how to tackle the constant shift of some kinds of treatment from one provider industry to another. Among the most important examples are ambulatory surgery and the ambulatory treatment of major psychiatric disorders. These and related examples raise the question of whether the measurement of treatment epi- sodes should stop at the production boundary between health care provider indus- tries. Reduced resource utilisation (and shorter length of stay) in hospitals, e.g., may be partly offset by increasing demand for health care in an ambulatory setting, such as improved drugs. Other residential care 7.20. For non-market production, the numbers of cases and/or occupied beds are only rough indicators for output of nursing home-type facilities. The definition of case- mix is less developed for long-term care than for (acute) hospital care. The measure- ment of case-mix in nursing home care should include, besides age and gender, at least a basic scale for the help needed to perform activities of daily living (ADL-type categorisation). Ambulatory health care 7.21. Ambulatory health care comprises a wide variety of rather heterogeneous industries (pro- viders of care). In principle, the unit of measurement should again be a well-defined episode of treatment. The main difficulty for accurate price measurement of ambulatory care is in the fragmentation of services that constitute an episode of treatment. The num- ber of patients, e.g., is not a good proxy indicator for volume measurement.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 96Public health services and administration 7.22. The methodological foundation for defining volume measures for government adminis- tration and public health services is much weaker than that for health care services. Indi- cators such as numbers of forms processed or number of food inspections or number of vaccinations performed are far from being ideal indicators. From a public health perspec- tive, one might argue that the number of procedures such as forms processed is not a \"desired output \" and should not be used as an indicator for increased productivity. The number of vaccinations, on the other hand, may be a closer proxy to an output indicator. Further study of volume and productivity measurement in health administration is needed before decisive progress can be made. MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY CHANGES 7.23. Quality changes in health care services are difficult to monitor and presently go largely unrecorded. This is partly due to weaknesses in methodology. Besides the definition of quality measures, it is the separation of quality improvement from changing case-mix, and the standardisation of output for severity of patients treated (uniform units of measure- ment) which is difficult to achieve. There are, however, indicators that could serve at least as proxies for quality changes and which might not have been sufficiently exploited in price and volume measurement of health care services. 7.24. A list of examples for indicators of quality in health care are: rates of undesired outcome, such as: recovery rates (average length of survival); of re-admissions for number of deaths during or following treatment; rates of adequately trained patients for optimal follow-up treatment, e.g. patient 's com- pliance in dialysis treatment; rates of correct diagnosis of predominant illness (as confirmed by surgery, autopsy). 7.25. For measurement purposes, it has to be taken into account that these indicators are not independent of each other. An indicator like \"length of stay for hospital treatment \" is not a good proxy for quality changes, if taken for hospital output in isolation. Shorter length of stay is partly offset by more intensive utilisation of rehabilitative services (on an in- patient and out-patient basis) and/or more expensive treatment with pharmaceuticals in an out-patient setting. OUTPUT VERSUS OUTCOME MEASUREMENT 7.26. A series of recent studies has attempted to adjust price movements of components of the CPI by measuring changes in outcomes of health care (Cutler, et al., 1996 and Frank et al.,\u00a9 OECD 2000 977. P RICE AND VOLUME MEASUREMENT 1998). Widely used measures of outcome are indicators of gains in Quality Adjusted Life Years attributable to a specific treatment. There are several observations about this approach. 7.27. First, the SNA 93 explicitly distinguishes between outcome and output measurement in the context of the CPI, but the same arguments are relevant for non-market services: \"The objective is to measure the quantities of services actually delivered to house- holds. This should not be confused with the benefits derived from those services. The output of health services needs to be clearly distinguished from the health of the community. Indeed, one reason for trying to measure the output of health services may be to see the effect of an increase in the volume of health services on the health of the community. This obviously requires a measure of the volume of health services that is different from health itself. It is well-known that there are many factors such as sanitation, housing, nutrition, education, consumption of tobacco, alcohol and drugs, pollution, etc., whose collective impact on the health of the community may be far greater than that of the provision of health services. \" (SNA 93, para. 16.135-136) 7.28. Second, it has been argued that outcome in the sense of consequences of treatment on health status is only one among several aspects of quality. Other important aspects of quality that may not have a strong or direct impact on health status are accessibility of services and comfort ( e.g. treatment of caries with or without local anaesthesia). Accessi- bility provides an example of possible conflicts between the goal of outcome maximisation and other quality criteria. For example, the concentration of specialised hospital care into large care units which treat a large number of similar cases may be an efficient way for improving outcomes while limiting accessibility. A NOTE ON PURCHASING POWER PARITIES 7.29. For international price and volume comparisons in health care, many of the arguments presented in this chapter apply as well. There is an emerging consensus that output indi- cators are preferable to other ways of comparing prices in health care across countries. A proposal for the collection of market prices for a bundle of surgical procedures has re- cently been presented in the framework of the Eurostat-OECD Purchasing Power Parity Project. For the non-market sector of health care, the improvement of PPPs is currently under scrutiny.\u00a9 OECD 2000 998. THE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTS 8.1. A basic idea underlying this manual is that the accuracy and cross-national comparabil- ity of health expenditure estimates depend on precise definitions of the economic na- ture of underlying transactions and aggregates. Precise economic definitions furthermore help to avoid double counting as well as to prevent statistical omissions and thus foster the internal consistency of the framework. This is where a basic methodological com- patibility with SNA accounting rules plays an important role. A certain degree of con- sistency between the central framework of the System of National Accounts and the SHA is also required for linking SHA statistics with other social and economic data. But this later aspect should not be the dominant one, as aggregate SNA statistics them- selves may be of limited comparability, e.g. due to different coverage of the informal economy in the main aggregates. 8.2. The System of Health Accounts recommends for health accounting an economic framework and accounting rules, which are methodologically compatible with the System of National Accounts, 1993 Revision (SNA 93), wherever this is deemed appropriate (see the eco- nomic framework of expenditure definitions in Chapters 5 and 6). 8.3. This chapter explains the similarities in methodology and also the main differences between the SHA and health satellite accounts by explicitly referring to the SNA 93 recommendations on the construction of health satellite accounts (see SNA 93, Chapter XXI). The conceptual overlap of the System of Health Accounts (SHA) with health satellite accounts should become more transparent by this recast of SHA recom- mendations in technical terms of SNA 93. This chapter also builds a bridge betweenA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 100SHA and health satellite accounts in order to assist developers of national health satellite accounts with guidelines. 8.4. Thus, this chapter has two purposes. First, it should help clarify and summarise the recommendations of the SHA regarding the appropriate degree of integration with the System of National Accounts from both a methodological point of view and from the point of view of optimal resource allocation in health statistics. Second, it provides explicit cross-references for specialists working on health satellite accounts in countries that decided to estimate health expenditure totals in such a framework. The chapter provides tools for researchers interested in satellite analysis. 8.5. In summary, the difference between the SHA and a health satellite account is not a funda- mental one but rather lies in the priorities and the sequence of tasks to be tackled. The main difference between the SHA and health satellite accounts are the degree of integra- tion of the underlying estimation systems and body of source statistics on which the SHA and health satellite accounts rest. The SHA estimates will make extensive use of all data sources available for analysing health care provision and financing whereas health satellite accounts in many cases have a focus on reconciling SNA input-output tables and core SNA aggregates with SHA aggregates. Although this reconciliation can be a powerful instrument to improve the quality of SNA estimates and also serve as additional quality check on SHA estimates, this is a resource demanding exercise that only few countries will be in a position to undertake in the near future. WHAT ARE HEALTH SATELLITE ACCOUNTS ? 8.6. The System of National Accounts (SNA) provides a comprehensive and consistent picture of the entire economy. Its recommendations on classifying activities, transactions, prod- ucts, and institutions of the economy have been taken as starting points for the SHA framework of health accounting wherever this was deemed appropriate. Certain deficien- cies with regard to health accounting have been identified in the central framework of the SNA 93. 8.7. Health accounting needs to aim at a more detailed look at health care industries and requires a certain degree of flexibility in applying SNA rules. With its concept of function- ally-oriented satellite accounts, the SNA 93 provides a toolbox which extends core con- cepts of national accounting to serve the specific needs of socio-economic accounts for selected fields such as a nation 's health care system. 8.8. To meet these requirements for health and other social fields ( e.g. environmental protec- tion, education, tourism) the authors of the SNA 93 included a Chapter XXI on \"Func- tionally-oriented Satellite Accounts \" with frequent references to health accounting.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1018. T HE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTS Satellite accounts or systems generally stress the need to expand the analytical capacity of national accounting for selected areas of social concern in a flexible manner. Typi- cally, satellite accounts or systems allow for: the provision of additional information on particular social concerns of a func-tional or cross-sector nature; the use of complementary or alternative concepts, including the use of complemen-tary and alternative classifications and accounting frameworks, when needed to in- troduce additional dimensions to the conceptual framework of national accounts; extended coverage of costs and benefits of human activities; further analysis of data by means of relevant indicators and aggregates; linkage of physical data to data expressed in monetary terms. Source: Adapted from SNA 93, para. 21.4 8.9. Important requirements for extending core concepts of SNA rules which apply to both health satellite accounts and the System of Health Accounts are (SNA 93, Chapter 21): the possibility to split joint products provided by an institutional unit into separate products ( e.g., social services combined with health care services); the possibility to separate occupational health that does not enter into final consump- tion in the central framework; a different treatment of subsidies to health care providers that go unrecorded in finalconsumption in the central framework; the need to add household production of long-term care which corresponds to certaintypes of social benefits in cash. WHAT HAVE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ACCOUNTS AND ANALYSIS IN COMMON ? 8.10. This section illustrates how SHA terms can be translated into the framework used in a health satellite account. Two items are covered in more detail: the definition of specific goods and services and the production boundaries. The remaining points are summarised in Table 8.1. The detailed analysis of transfers and the identification of ultimate users and ultimate bearers of health expenses which are only sketched in the SNA 93 chapter on satellite accounts are dealt with in Chapter 6 of this manual. Conceptual overlap of the SHA with health satellite accounts 8.11. The following steps are required in order to translate the economic framework of the SHA in terms of a health satellite account in a flexible way (SNA 93, para. 21.53, 21.54): a comprehensive listing of goods and services considered specific to the production ofhealth care services (characteristic and connected); the determination of the boundary line of production to define total expenditure onhealth; the determination of activities for which capital formation will be recorded;A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 102the identification of specific transactions; the detailed analysis of transfers as an integrated part of health accounting; the identification of ultimate users and ultimate bearers of health expenses. Specific goods and services 8.12. The starting point of the System of Health Accounts (SHA) is the definition of goods and services whose final consumption constitutes the core functions of a country 's health care system. Analogously, the first step in designing a health satellite account is to define the goods and services specific to health (SNA, para. 21.61). Specific goods are further subdivided in the SNA recommendations into characteristic goods and connected goods. Characteristic goods and services are those of which the production side is studied in some detail, at least by cross-classifying goods and services and the institutions involved. The capital investment of these producers, the personnel they employ, etc., are to be analysed explicitly. In both the System of Health Accounts , and in health satellite accounts, these goods and services correspond to total expenditure on health. 8.13. Connected goods and services are those for which their conditions of production need not be monitored in detail. Corresponding outlays could be considered as expenditure on health in a wider sense for which the personnel employed is not considered as belonging to health care employment, nor is the investment into the producing units considered as investment into medical facilities. The corresponding item in the SHA are the functions HC.4, Ancillary services to health care and HC.5, Medical goods dispensed to out-patients. The boundary line of production 8.14. The estimation of non-market products in the System of Health Accounts (SHA) (item 1.1.2 in Table 8.1) departs slightly from the treatment in the central framework of the SNA. In the System of Health Accounts , this item should include transfer payments to households with family members caring for patients at home ( e.g. frail elderly people). These transfers are treated as quasi-salary and a corresponding \"production value \" should be calculated and included in total current health expenditure. Dependency allowances schemes pro- vide transfers to households to cover a sizeable share of the costs of persons with severe functional mobility or cognitive handicaps. Summary: expenditure totals in SHA and health satellite accounts 8.15. The consumption of specific goods and services corresponds to total current expenditure on health (minus occupational health care) in the System of Health Accounts . A separate reporting on market and non-market products is not of particular interest in the System of Health Accounts and therefore not included in the ICHA classification. This distinction is mainly required for estimation purposes.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1038. T HE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTS 8.16. Satellite accounts start from the definition of characteristic goods and services for the functionally defined field of study, investigate the production of these goods both in characteristic and other industries and identify the ultimate beneficiaries and sources of funding. Existing classifications for commodities, industries and sectors of the national economy are taken as a starting point in this process and used whenever this is deemed appropriate. Changes in the classifications used compared to the standard classifications that go along with the SNA 93 as well as changes in the definition of the boundaries of production are possible strategies in the construction of the satellite accounts as a flexible statistical instrument.Table 8.1. Expenditure on health in health satellite accounts and in the SHA Framework for components Expenditure components in the System of in satellite accounts (SNA 93, Table 21.1) Health Accounts (SHA) 1 Consumption of specific goods and services Total current expenditure on health (minus occupational health care) 1.1 Actual final consumption1.1.1 Market products Market production of medical goods and services 1.1.2 Non-market products Government and NPISH non-market production; household production of health care (quantified bytransfer payments in the SHA) 1.2 Intermediate consumption Occupational health care 1.2.1 Actual intermediate consumption (does not apply to the SHA) 1.2.2 Internal intermediate consumption Occupational health care 2 Capital formation in specific goods and services (human investment: health status as a stock variable) (not integrated in the SHA) 3 Capital formation of characteristic activities Investment into medical facilities in non-specific products Sum of items 1 to 3 T otal expenditure on health 4 Specific current transfers (other than a counterpart of 1) Health-related transfer payments (income maintenance in the form of cash-benefits to private households) Total uses of resident units T otal expenditure on health and health-related transfers to private households 6 Current uses of resident units financed (covered in the SHA tables on flows of financing) by the rest of the world (less) 7 Capital uses of resident units financed (not covered in the SHA) by the rest of the world (less) National expenditure on health (no counterpart in the SHA)A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 104Differences in underlying information systems between the SHA and national accounts 8.17. The SHA follows the same sequence in the design of its accounts as described above. The situation in health accounting is, however, significantly different from that encountered by existing or currently developed systems of satellite accounts in areas such as environment, tourism, and agriculture for two main reasons: The definition of basic categories of commodities and functions of health care islargely uncharted territory. The Central Product Classification, e.g., which is used in other accounting systems as a starting point, only provides categories of health care services that are defined in broad terms of health care service industries. The division of labour in providing health care across these health care industries varies, however, from country to country. Consequently, internationally comparable func- tions can hardly be derived from these largely circular definitions of health care services by industries. As health care is predominantly a public responsibility in OECD countries, healthaccounts have typically relied on administrative data with insufficient statistical resources devoted to the task of designing adequate surveys for standardised eco- nomic accounts. Research into health care services and health care service indus- tries in a comprehensive way, as well as investigations into the socio-economic side of health care, have only recently attracted increasing funding in a growing number of OECD countries. Should better statistics on the production side be a priority task in improving health care statistics? 8.18. To address the inadequacy of statistical resources in the area of health care services research, this manual suggests concentrating on the design of a clearly defined func- tional view on health care to complement traditional approaches which focused pre- dominantly on institutional aspects. Improving health care statistics along these lines would strengthen the statistical foundation which is necessary for research into health care services - both in economic terms and for research - into the organisation of care, the resources available and their utilisation, both in monetary and non-mon- etary terms. 8.19. After this first step has been taken and corresponding classifications developed, tested and implemented on a pilot basis in several countries, the construction of a fully-fledged health satellite account could be desirable for some countries. T ogether with price indices for value added, already estimated in several OECD countries, productivity measures could then be constructed and monitored over time (as real per capita value added, real value added per full-time-equivalent personnel employed in health care services, etc.). The ex- pansion of the SHA into a satellite account for health may be a desirable tool for health policy and structural economic analysis in a medium-term perspective. But estimating a complete picture of the value-added structure of health care production can be very cum- bersome due to the heterogeneity of provider industries.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1058. T HE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTS 8.20. The following four additional accounts would provide extensions of the SHA relevant in the framework of a satellite account for health and for satellite analysis (see also the next section): production account and health care value added by health care industry; intermediate inputs to the production of health care industries by type of input; health care industries ' gross capital stock; an input/output table of health care industries. An illustrative economic model of supply and use in health care 8.21. For health satellite accounts, the production side of the economy can be divided into three kinds of activities: health care provider industries, other medical industries, other indus- tries. Other medical industries are mainly acting as producers for intermediate consump- tion and for capital formation in the health care system, or for export. Part of final consumption in health care goods and services as well as part of intermediate products and gross capital formation is in turn imported. Expenditure of health care goods and services comprise both purchases and own final use. Own final use is non-market production by government and non-profit institutions serving households. Tables 8.2 and 8.3 translate the satellite input-output model outlined in the SNA 93 (Table 21.5) into an extension of the SHA that covers the production side. 8.22. Table 8.3 combines the production and use side of the health care system within the frame- work of the total national economy. This supply and use table shows the heterogeneity of the production process in medical service industries and the interaction of the institu- tional, functional and financing dimension of health accounts in the estimation process of total health. 8.23. Medical goods and services are produced both by the health care system (= institution- ally-defined health care services industries), and by the rest of the economy. The pro- ducing units (institutions) of the health care system are those whose principal economic activity is the production of health care goods and services for final use (as part of private or government consumption). Part of total production of the health care system is exported. 8.24. A minor part of the production of health care service industries may, however, consist of intermediate products or non-health care products. In estimating total health expendi- ture, total gross production of the health care system will slightly differ from the sum of final consumption on health. University hospitals, e.g., perform - besides providing health care - R&D and are involved in education and training of health personnel. Physicians in private practice may work part-time for hospitals, or for other office-based colleagues, in which case double-counting has to be avoided. Some office based physicians may work part-time for the pharmaceutical industry, publishers and the like - services that do not fall under functions of health care in the SHA. In addition, a small fraction of expenditure on health comprises sales of providers whose principal economic activity is distinct fromA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 106medical service functions. An example is sales of medical goods by retailers not specialised in medical goods. 8.25. The model in Tables 8.2 and 8.3 is illustrative only. As has been mentioned above, the input-output matrix of these two tables is not seen as a priority task in the framework of the SHA. The framework in these tables does, however, provide suggestions on how to check the consistency of statistics on expenditure flows of goods and services obtained from differ- ent statistical sources (surveys in health care provider industries, expenditure surveys, ac- counts of social insurance and government authorities, investment surveys, foreign trade statistics). Within this framework, it would be possible to calculate cross-checks for expen- diture on health by comparing separate estimates for the production and for the use side of the accounts after the deduction of intermediate consumption and non-health-care produc- tion from total gross production. Inter-industry flows within medical service industries may be very small with the largest part of production going to final consumption. 8.26. The calculation of gross value added and its components would lead - together with the estimation of factor input (hours worked, amount and structure of capital) - to additional cross-checks and further insights into the cost-structure of health care production. These additional tables would lead to a full-fledged health satellite account.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1078. T HE SHA AND HEALTH SATELLITE ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTSTable 8.2.

ICHA-HC FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE OVERVIEW 9.1. The one-digit level of the functional classification (introduced in Chapter 3) is extended in this chapter by items at the two- and the three-digit level (Table 9.1) complemented by explanatory notes. The development of a fine structure of functions of health care at the three-digit level and beyond is, however, still experimental (see also the recommended additional dimensions for reporting under various functions of personal care that are out- lined in Chapter 3, Table 3.2 and 3.3). 9.2. Annex 9.1 to this chapter discusses selected boundary issues of health care. Cross- classifications of the ICHA-HC with the functional classifications in the System of National Accounts are provided in Annex 9.2 to encourage the reconciliation of health accounting with the System of National Accounts and its accompanying classifications. A cross-classification of public health functions of the ICHA-HC is presented in Annex 9.3. FUNCTIONS OF PERSONAL HEALTH CARE 9.3. Functions of personal health care comprise functions HC.1 to HC.5. These are services and goods that can be directly allocated to individuals as distinct from services provided to society at large (HC.6, Prevention and public health services; and HC.7, Health adminis- tration and health insurance). Functions of personal health care are both classified by basic functions of care (curative, rehabilitative and long-term nursing care) and by mode of pro- duction (in-patient, day care, out-patient, home care).A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 112Curative, rehabilitative and long-term nursing care 9.4. The basic criterion for classifying health care services is the type of episode of care provided (curative, rehabilitative and long-term nursing care). Definitions developed by the Austra- lian Health Data Committee, and by the US Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations have been used as a model. Modes of production 9.5. The following definitions of mode of production are used throughout the ICHA- HC classification for defining categories of personal health care services at the two- digit level. In-patient care 9.6. An in-patient is a patient who is formally admitted (or \"hospitalised \") to an institution for treatment and/or care and stays for a minimum of one night in the hospital or other institution providing in-patient care. In-patient care is mainly delivered in hos- pitals, but partially also in nursing and residential care facilities or in establishments that are classified according to their focus of care under the ambulatory-care industry but perform in-patient care as a secondary activity. It should be noted that the term \"in-patient \" used in the SHA has a wider meaning compared to some national report- ing systems where this term is limited to in-patient care in hospitals. Included are services delivered to in-patients in prison and army hospitals, tuberculosis hospitals, and sanatoriums. In-patient care includes accommodation provided in combination with medical treatment when the latter is the predominant activity provided during the stay as an in-patient. 9.7. Providing patients and patients ' relatives with accommodation is considered an inte- gral part of in-patient care. The hotel function of hospital care becomes apparent when patients are transferred to post-acute hospital wards or \"hostels \" providing less intensive and limited health care but which are functionally integrated in the provision of hospital care. 9.8. A stay in \"hotel wards \" is part of the therapeutic course and warrants to be recorded under total expenditure on health. This includes the hosting of patients ' relatives whose presence is an indispensable part of therapy, for example in the case of severe treatment episodes of children; in particular those performed in highly specialised hospitals far away from the patient 's hometown. In the case of developing countries the imputed or actual cost of services performed by patients ' relatives in hospitals - including cooking, basic nursing care, and cleaning - would be included under this heading.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1139. ICHA-HC F UNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE 9.9. On the other hand, accommodation in institutions providing social services, where health care is an important but not predominant component should not be included in the health function. Examples might include institutions such as homes for disabled persons, nurs- ing homes, and residential care for substance abuse patients. Day care 9.10. Day care comprises medical and paramedical services delivered to patients that are for- mally admitted for diagnosis, treatment or other types of health care with the intention of discharging the patient on the same day. An episode of care for a patient who is admitted as a day-care patient and subsequently stays overnight is classified as an overnight stay or other in-patient case. Services for non-admitted patients that are extended to formal ad- mission for day-care are considered as day care. A day patient (or \"same-day patient \") is usually admitted and then discharged after staying between 3 and 8 hours on the same day. Day care is usually performed in institutions or wards specialised for this kind of care (for example elective surgery). Out-patient care 9.11. This item comprises medical and paramedical services delivered to out-patients. An out- patient is not formally admitted to the facility (physician 's private office, hospital out- patient centre or ambulatory-care centre) and does not stay overnight. An out-patient is thus a person who goes to a health care facility for a consultation/treatment, and who leaves the facility within several hours of the start of the consultation without being \"admitted \" to the facility as a patient. It should be noted that the term \"out-patient \" used in the SHA has a wider meaning compared to some national reporting systems where this term is limited to care in out-patient wards of hospitals. In the SHA, all visitors to ambulatory care facilities that are not day cases or over-the-night cases, are considered out-patients. Home care 9.12. This item comprises medical and paramedical services delivered to patients at home. It excludes the consumption of medical goods (pharmaceuticals, other medical goods) dis- pensed to out-patients as part of private household consumption. Included are obstetric services at home, home dialysis, telematic services and the like.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 114Table 9.1.

ICHA-HC F UNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE ICHA-HC CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS HC.1 Services of curative care This item comprises medical and paramedical services delivered during an episode of curative care. An episode of curative care is one in which the principal medical intent is to relieve symp- toms of illness or injury, to reduce the severity of an illness or injury or to protect against exac- erbation and/or complication of an illness and/ or injury which could threaten life or normal function. Includes : obstetric services; cure of illness or pro- vision of definitive treatment of injury; the per- formance of surgery; diagnostic paramedical services delivered to in-patients dur- ing an episode of curative care for an admitted patient. Includes: overnight stays. During an overnight stay, in-patients leave the hospital or other in- stitutions the day following the day of admis- sion but usually not less than twelve hours after admission. Note: the SHA suggests to further disaggregate d this category by ICD and DRG groups, where available (see Chapter 3, comprise medical and paramedical services delivered to day-care patientsTable 9.1.

Out- patient health care comprises mainly services delivered to out-patients by physicians in estab- lishments of the ambulatory health care industry. Out-patients may also be treated in establishments of the hospital industry, for example in specialised out-patient wards, and in community or other integrated care facilities. HC.1.3.1 Basic medical and diagnostic services This item comprises services of medical diagnosisand therapy that are common components of most medical encounters and that are provided by phy- sicians to out-patients. These include routine ex- aminations, medical assessments, prescription of pharmaceuticals, routine counselling of patients, dietary regime, injections and vaccination (only if not covered under public-health prevention programmes). They can be part of initial medical attention and consultation or of follow-up con- tacts. Routine administrative procedures like fill- ing in and updating patients ' records are usually an integral part of basic medical services.Excludes : home visits by general practitioners and primary care physicians; paramedical services pre- scribed by physicians and performed under their own responsibility by paramedical professionals, either in their own practice or in a setting affili- ated with physicians, or group practices. Note: most items under Section 5 (Therapeutic Procedures) and many of the items of Section 8 (Clinical and Administrative Services) of the IC- Process-PC fall under this category (see IC- Process-PC, 1986). Exceptions to this rule are physical therapy (IC-Process-PC, 55), reproductive and urologic system procedures (56), obstetrical procedures (57) and psychological counselling/ assessment and health education (82, 84). Basic medical services are distinct from more specialised services in that they can typically be performed without using sophisticated medical equipment. When medical records do not allow for a separation of activities by physicians into the components defined under HC.1.3, a separation of services according to professions should be used as a first approximation. HC.1.3.2 Out-patient dental care This item comprises dental medical services (in-cluding dental prosthesis) provided to out-patients by physicians. It includes the whole range of ser- vices performed usually by medical specialists of dental care in an out-patient setting such as tooth extraction, fitting of dental prosthesis and dental implants. Note: dental prostheses are treated in the SHA as intermediate products to the production of serv- ices of dental care and thus are always included under expenditure on dental care. HC.1.3.3 All other specialised health care This item comprises all specialised medical ser-vices provided to out-patients by physicians other\u00a9 OECD 2000 1179. ICHA-HC F UNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE than basic medical and diagnostic services and dental care. Included are mental health and sub- stance abuse therapy and out-patient surgery. HC.3.1.9 All other out-patient curative care This item comprises all other miscellaneousmedical and paramedical services provided to out-patients by physicians or paramedical prac- titioners. Included are services provided to out- patients by paramedical professionals such as chiropractors, occupational therapists, and au- diologists. Included are also paramedical men- tal health and substance abuse therapy, and speech therapy. This item includes paramedical traditional health care services. Includes : diagnostic physical therapy, physical therapy exercise and other therapeutical proce- dures, such as hydrotherapy and heat care; attention to wounds; osteopathic treatment; speech therapy; training all medical and paramedical curative services provided to patients at home. Note: this includes home visits to provide curative care, including diagnostic procedures by general practitioners; specialised services such as home dialysis; obstetric services; telematic services. When curative home care is provided in combination with social services such as homemaking or \"meals on wheels \", these services should be recorded sepa- rately as they are not part of expenditure on health in the definition of the SHA. HC.2 Services of rehabilitative care This item comprises medical and paramedical ser- vices delivered to patients during an episode of rehabilitative care. Rehabilitative care comprisesservices where the emphasis lies on improving the functional levels of the persons served and where the functional limitations are either due to a re- cent event of illness or injury or of a recurrent nature (regression or progression). Included are services delivered to persons where the onset of disease or impairment to be treated occurred fur- ther in the past or has not been subject to prior rehabilitation services. Note: rehabilitative care is generally more in- tensive than traditional nursing facility care and less than acute (curative) care. It requires fre- quent (daily to weekly) recurrent patient assess- ment and review of the clinical course and treatment plan for a limited (several days to sev- eral months) time period, until a condition is stabilised or a pre-determined treatment course is completed. /c72/c67/c46/c50/c46/c49 /c73/c110/c45/c112/c97/c116/c105/c101/c110/c116/c32/c114 This paramedical ser- vices delivered to in-patients during an episode of rehabilitative care for vices delivered to day-care patients medical paramedical ser- vices delivered during an episode of rehabilitative care to out-patients. /c72/c67/c46/c50/c46/c52 /c83/c101/c114/c118/c105/c99/c101/c115/c32/c111/c102/c32/c114/c101/c104/c97/c98/c105/c108/c105/c116/c97/c116/c105/c118 /c101/c32/c104/c111/c109/c101/c32/c99/c97/c114/c101This item comprises medical and paramedical ser- vices delivered to patients at home during an epi- sode of rehabilitative care.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 118HC.3 Services of long-term nursing care Long-term health care comprises ongoing health and nursing care given to in-patients who need assistance on a continuing basis due to chronic impairments and a reduced degree of indepen- dence and activities of daily living. In-patient long-term care is provided in institutions or com- munity facilities. Long-term care is typically a mix of medical (including nursing care) and so- cial services. Only the former is recorded in the SHA under health expenditure. /c72/c67/c46/c51/c46/c49 /c73/c110/c45/c112/c97/c116/c105/c101/c110/c116/c32/c108/c111/c110/c103/c45/c116/c101/c114/c109/c32/c110/c117/c114/c115/c105/c110/c103/c32/c99/c97/c114 /c101 This item comprises nursing care delivered to in- patients who need assistance on a continuing ba- sis due to chronic impairments and a reduced degree of independence and activities of daily liv- ing. In-patient long-term nursing care is provided in institutions or community facilities. Long-term care is typically a mix of medical and social ser- vices. Only health care services are recorded in the SHA under personal health care services. Includes: long-term health care for dependent eld- erly patients. This includes respite care and care provided in homes for the aged by specially trained persons, where medical nursing care is an impor- tant component. This type of care can be pro- vided in combination with social services that should, however, be recorded separately, as they are not part of expenditure on health in the SHA. This includes hospice or palliative care (medical, paramedical and nursing care services to the ter- minally ill, including the counselling for their families). Hospice care is usually provided in nurs- ing homes or similar specialised institutions. Also included is in-patient long-term nursing care for mental health and substance abuse patients where the care need is due to chronic or recurrentpsychiatric conditions as defined by the list pro- vided in ICD-9-CM, code 94. /c72/c67/c46/c51/c46/c50 /c68 /c97 /c121/c32/c99/c97/c115/c101/c115/c32/c111/c102/c32/c108/c111/c110/c103/c45/c116/c101/c114/c109/c32/c110/c117/c114/c115/c105/c110/c103/c32/c99/c97/c114/c101This item comprises nursing care delivered to day cases of patients who need assistance on a con- tinuing basis due to chronic impairments and a reduced degree of independence and activities of daily living.

This type of home care can include social services such as homemaking and \"meals on wheels \" which should, however, be recorded separately, as they are not part of expenditure on health. HC.4 Ancillary services to health care This item comprises a variety of services, mainly performed by paramedical or medical technical personnel with or without the direct supervision of a medical doctor, such as laboratory, diagnosis imaging and patient transport. /c72/c67/c46/c52/c46/c49/c46 /c67/c108/c105/c110/c105/c99/c97/c108/c32/c108/c97/c98/c111/c114 /c97/c116/c111/c114/c121 This item covers the following services: urine, physi- cal and chemical tests, blood chemistry, automated blood chemistry profiles, haematology, immunol- ogy, faeces, microbiologic cultures, microscopic ex- amination, specialised cytology and tissue pathology, all other miscellaneous laboratory tests.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1199. ICHA-HC F UNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE Note: this list is based on agreements reached under ICPM and IC-Process-PC, and comprises the fami- lies of clinical and pathology tests as listed in the IC-Process-PC (IC-Process-PC, 1986, Section 2). An alternative list is provided by ICD-9-CM: 90 Microscopic examination-I, 91 Microscopic exami- nation-II. /c72/c67/c46/c52/c46/c50/c46 /c68/c105/c97/c103/c110/c111/c115/c116/c105/c99/c32/c105/c109/c97/c103/c105/c110/c103 This item comprises diagnostic imaging services provided to out-patients. Note: Diagnostic imaging comprises the following items described in the ICD-9-CM procedure component: 87 Diagnostic radiology, 88 Other diagnostic radiology and related techniques. The corresponding sub-headings given in the IC- Process-PC (IC-Process-PC, 1986, Section 3) are: Plain X-ray, bone; Soft tissue imaging, plain (excluding nuclear scanning, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound); Contrast X-rays or photo- imaging; Computerised tomography and nuclear magnetic imaging; Nuclear scanning; Diagnostic ultrasound; All other miscellaneous diagnostic imaging (arteriography using contrast material, angiocardiography, phlebography, in a spe- cially-equipped surface vehicle or in a designated air ambulance to and from facilities for the pur- poses of receiving medical and surgical care. It also includes transportation in conventional ve- hicles, such as taxi, when the latter is authorised and the costs are reimbursed to the patient ( e.g. for patients undergoing renal dialysis or chemo- therapy). Includes : emergency transport services of public fire rescue departments or defence that operate ona regular basis for civilian emergency services (not only for catastrophe medicine). /c72/c67/c46/c52/c46/c57 /c65/c108/c108/c32/c111/c116/c104/c101/c114/c32/c109/c105/c115/c99/c101/c108/c108/c97/c110/c101/c111/c117/c115/c32/c97/c110/c99/c105/c108/c108/c97/c114 /c121/c32/c115/c101/c114 /c118/c105/c99/c101/c115 This item comprises all other miscellaneous an- cillary services to health care. HC.5 Medical goods dispensed to out-patients This item comprises medical goods dispensed to out-patients and the services connected with dis- pensing, such as retail trade, fitting, maintaining, and renting of medical goods and appliances. In- cluded are services of public pharmacies, opticians, sanitary shops, and other specialised or non- specialised retail traders including mail ordering and teleshopping. Note: the group of goods covered comprises es- sentially the products listed in the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP , United Nations, 1998 b) under 06.1, Medical products, appliances and equipment (see Annex A.6 to this manual). This group covers medicaments, prostheses, medi- cal appliances and equipment and other health related products provided to individuals, either with or without a prescription, usually from dis- pensing chemists, pharmacists or medical equip- ment suppliers and intended for consumption or use by a single individual or household outside a health facility or institution. With COICOP being a one-dimensional classifi- cation, not primarily designed for the purposes of health accounting, a different regrouping was cho- sen for the proposed ICHA-HC. Renting and repair of therapeutic appliances and equipment is reported under the corresponding categories of goods. Also included is the service of dispensing medical goods, fitting of prostheses and servicesA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 120like eye tests, in those cases where these services are performed by specially trained retail traders and not by medical professions. Following COICOP recommendations, the follow- ing items are excluded : protective goggles, belts and supports for sport; veterinary products; sun-glasses not fitted with corrective lenses; medicinal soaps. The COICOP classifies all the medical products listed above as non-durables, whereas in several National Health Accounts, \"Durable medical goods \" are dis- tinguished from consumable or disposable products. Excludes : pharmaceuticals, prostheses, and other medical and health-related goods supplied to in- patients and day-care patients or products deliv- ered to out-patients as part of treatment provided within the facilities of ambulatory care. /c72/c67/c46/c53/c46/c49 /c80/c104/c97/c114/c109/c97/c99/c101/c117/c116/c105/c99/c97/c108/c115/c32/c97/c110/c100/c32/c111/c116/c104/c101/c114/c32/c109/c101/c100/c105/c99/c97/c108 /c110/c111/c110/c45/c100/c117/c114/c97/c98/c108/c101/c115 This item comprises pharmaceuticals such as me- dicinal preparations, branded and generic medi- cines, drugs, patent medicines, serums and vaccines, vitamins and minerals and oral contraceptives.

Note: the above list corresponds to recommenda- tions in COICOP (United Nations, 1998 b). HC.6 Prev ention and public health services Prevention and public health services comprise ser- vices designed to enhance the health status of the population as distinct from the curative services, which repair health dysfunction. Typical services are vaccination campaigns and programmes. Note: prevention and public health functions in- cluded in the ICHA-HC do not cover all fields ofpublic health in the broadest sense of a cross-func- tional common concern for health matters and public actions. Some of these broadly defined pub- lic health functions, such as emergency plans and environmental protection, are not part of expen- diture on health. The most important of these public health functions are classified under vari- ous health-related functions in the ICHA-HC. A cross-classification of public health functions ac- cording to a broad WHO list of Essential public health functions [EPHFs, Bettcher (1998)] with ICHA-HC and COFOG (United Nations, 1998 b) is provided in Annex 9.3 of this chapter. /c72/c67/c46/c54/c46/c49 /c77/c97/c116/c101/c114/c110/c97/c108/c32/c97/c110/c100/c32/c99 /c104/c105/c108/c100/c32/c104/c101/c97/c108/c116/c104/c59/c32/c102/c97/c109/c105/c108 /c121 /c112/c108/c97/c110/c110/c105/c110/c103/c32/c97/c110/c100/c32/c99/c111/c117/c110/c115/c101/c108/c108/c105/c110/c103 Maternal and child health covers a wide range of health care services such as genetic counselling and prevention of specific congenital abnormalities, prenatal and postnatal medical attention, baby Table 9.2.

Excludes: vaccination for occupational health (HC.6.5); vaccination for travel and tourism on the patients ' own initiative (HC.1.3.1). /c72/c67/c46/c54/c46/c52 /c80 /c114/c101 /c118 /c101/c110/c116/c105/c111/c110/c32/c111/c102/c32/c110/c111/c110/c45/c99/c111/c109/c109/c117/c110/c105/c99/c97/c98/c108/c101 /c100/c105/c115/c101/c97/c115/c101/c115 This item comprises public health services of health education, disease prevention, and the pro-motion of healthy living conditions and lifestyles such as services provided by centres for disease surveillance and control; and programmes for the avoidance of risks incurred and the improvement of the health status of nations even when not spe- cifically directed towards communicable diseases. Includes : interventions against smoking, alcohol and substance abuse such as anti-smoking cam- paigns; activities of community workers; services provided by self-help groups; general health edu- cation and health information of the public; health education campaigns; campaigns in favour of healthier life-styles, safe sex, etc.; information ex- changes: e.g. alcoholism, drug addiction. Excludes : public health environmental surveil- lance and public information on environmen- tal conditions. Note: health promotion and disease prevention pre- sents a difficult boundary issue for which no in- ternational classification exists. The boundaries drawn in National Health Accounts are usually linked to the identification of specific programmes of screening and health check-ups with a legally or administratively defined, limited coverage re- imbursed separately under public or private health programmes. Examples are screening of blood pressure, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer, dental health, and \"health check-ups \". Prevention is, in many instances, a reason for en- counter in primary care and not a separate proce- dure. This means that the same procedure (for example, many diagnostic procedures) can be ei- ther performed as preventive measures for screen- ing purposes or as diagnostic procedures in the case of an acute health problem. The criterion for including services under this item is whether pre- vention is provided as a social programme (public or private, including occupational health) or is requested on the patient 's own initiative.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1239.

This excludes, how- ever, remuneration-in-kind of health services and goods that constitute household actual fi- nal consumption rather than intermediate con- sumption of business. Note: occupational health care corresponds to class 05.2: Health in the Classification of the Out- lays of Producers by Purpose (United Nations, 1998 b) applied to intermediate consumption of producers. Occupational health care is an inter- mediate consumption within the business sector. Occupational health care is only part of a broader range of activities that aim at improving the work- ing environment in its relation to health. Occu- pational health activities to improve ergonomy, safety and health and environmental protection at the workplace, accident prevention, etc., should be distinguished from occupational health care. They are not to be recorded under health care ac- tivities in the SHA. /c72/c67/c46/c54/c46/c57 /c65/c108/c108/c32/c111/c116/c104/c101/c114/c32/c109/c105/c115/c99/c101/c108/c108/c97/c110/c101/c111/c117/c115/c32/c112/c117/c98/c108/c105/c99 /c104/c101/c97/c108/c116/c104/c32/c115/c101/c114 /c118/c105/c99/c101/c115 This item comprises a variety of miscellaneous public health services, such as operation and ad- ministration of blood and organ banks, and the preparation and dissemination of information on public health matters not classified elsewhere. Includes : public health environmental surveil- lance and public information on environmental conditions.HC.7 Health administration and health insurance Health administration and health insurance are activities of private insurers and central and local authorities, and social security.

This corresponds to post-secondary and tertiary education in the field of health (according to ISCED-97 code) by cen- tral and local government, and private institutions such as nursing schools run by private hospitals. Note: if properly accounted for, education and training of health personnel is not an overlappingfunction between health and education. In teach- ing hospitals, for example, it would be desirable to have separate budgets for care provided, R&D, and for training. Where detailed accounts are missing, statistical practice as designed for UNESCO/OECD/Eurostat data collections on education and training is an alternative option (UNESCO/OECD/Eurostat, 1995). Education and training of health personnel takes place mainly at ISCED-levels 5 (non-university degree tertiary level) to 7 (university tertiary level of education, leading to a second or further uni- versity degree or equivalent). The following insti- tutions graduate schools in medical/biomedical depart-ments (ISCED 7). Medical education and training corresponds in the list of fields of study (at the tertiary level of educa- tion) provided by the ISCED manual (UNESCO, 1996) to the category Medical science and health- related (ISCED code 50). The ISCED manual, furthermore, has a category Health-related auxil- iary programmes (ISCED 50) at the upper second- ary level of education for vocational and technical programmes. Complete costs would include expenditure for uni- versities and other training institutions. Salaries of medical interns and residents or trainee nurses are reported under expenditure on health, for the ser- vices rendered. The training expenditure are also reported in the educational accounts. The intent of this category is to include expenditure for train- ing that are closely linked to the care of patients in health care services rather than in expenditure on education and training. The following recommen- dation for university hospitals is taken from the UNESCO/OECD/Eurostat manual:\u00a9 OECD 2000 1259. ICHA-HC F UNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE \"Expenditure of or for teaching hospitals (sometimes referred to as academic hospitals or university hospitals) should not be included in education expenditure, except to the lim- ited extent that they are directly and specifi- cally related to the training of medical person- nel. In particular, all costs of patient care other than general expenses of academic hospitals should be excluded from the education figures, even if the education authorities must pay such expenses. Expenditure for research in academic hospitals should also be excluded, except that no attempt should be made to distinguish between the re- search and non-research portions of the time of teaching staff whose compensation is other- wise considered part of education expenditure. /c82/c101/c115/c101/c97/c114 /c99/c104 /c32 /c97/c110/c100/c32/c100/c101 /c118 /c101/c108/c111/c112/c109/c101/c110/c116/c32/c105/c110/c32/c104/c101/c97/c108/c116/c104 This in health according to the following definition: \"R&D programmes directed towards the protection and improvement of human health. It includes R&D on food hygiene and nutri- tion and also R&D on radiation used for medi- cal purposes, biochemical engineering, medi- cal information, rationalisation of treatment and pharmacology (including testing medicines and breeding of laboratory animals for scien- tific purposes) as well as research relating to epidemiology, prevention of industrial diseases and drug addiction. \" (OECD, 1994 d, Frascati Manual, p. 122) Note: government involvement in health R&D is classified in the COFOG as part of the health func- tion (COFOG, 07.5 R&D Health). The Frascati Manual (OECD, 1994 d) provides detailed definitions of R&D in business and government activities, including non-profitinstitutions and institutions of higher education. The Frascati Manual is the joint product of national experts on R&D in OECD Member countries, the OECD Secretariat and other international organisations. These guidelines are consistent with UNESCO recommendations. The Frascati Manual discusses boundary problems between R&D, education, and health care and other industries providing guidelines for standard reporting in these and other fields, drawing the boundary line distinguishing the field from health care and from education and training of health personnel. The Frascati Manual provides the ba- sic definitions of R&D: \"Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. R&D covers three distinct activities: basic re- search, applied research and experimental de- velopment. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to ac- quire new knowledge of the underlying foun- dation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is also original investi- gation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective. Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience that is di- rected to producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed. \" (OECD, 1994 d, Frascati Manual, p. 29) The basic criterion for distinguishing R&D from related activities is \"the presence in R&D of anA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 126appreciable element of novelty and the resolution of scientific and/or technological uncertainty, i.e. when the solution to a problem is not readily ap- parent to someone familiar with the basic stock of commonly used knowledge and techniques in the area concerned. \" \"... In the field of medicine, rou- tine autopsy on the causes of death is simply the practice of health care and not R&D; special in- vestigation of a particular mortality in order to establish the side effects of certain cancer treat- ments is R&D. Similarly, routine tests such as blood and bacteriological tests carried out for doc- tors, are not R&D but a special programme of blood tests in connection with the introduction of a new drug is R&D. \" (OECD, 1994 d, Frascati Manual, p. 33) The following recommendation regarding the bor- derline between specialised health care and R&D from the Frascati Manual on R&D statistics should be adopted for the collection of health care statistics: \"In university hospitals where, in addition to the primary activity of health care, the training of medical students is of major importance, the activities of teaching, R&D and advanced as well as routine health care are frequently very closely linked. 'Specialised health care ' is an activity which normally is to be excluded from R&D. However, there may be an element of R&D in what is usually called 'advanced health care', carried out, for example, in university hospitals. It is difficult for university doctors and their assistants to define that part of their overall activities which is exclusively R&D. If, however, time and money spent on routine health care are included in the R&D statistics, there will be an over-estimate of R&D resources in the medical sciences. Usually such advanced health care is not considered R&D and all health care not directly linked to a specific R&D project should be excluded from the R&D statistics. \" (OECD, 1994 d, Frascati Manual , p. 37)R&D in health, when measured according to the rules of the Frascati Manual , excludes outlays by pharmaceutical firms, shown separately. For data collection on R&D, international standards exist. More details on data collection and international standards for reporting in R&D are documented in the Frascati Manual (OECD, 1994 d). Activities of R&D in health care should exclude all education and training of health personnel in uni- versities and special institutions of higher and post- secondary education. However, research by postgraduate students carried out at universities and university hospitals in medical sciences should be counted, wherever possible, as part of R&D in health care. R&D outlays by pharmaceutical firms have to be distinguished from other related scientific and technological activities ( Frascati Manual , p. 30-33), such as, item comprises a variety of activities of a public health concern that are part of other pub- lic activities such as inspection and regulation of various industries, including water supply.

Note: the provision of health care benefits in kind under social protection arrangements is in some cases closely intertwined with the provision of so- cial benefits in kind to assist living with disease and medical impairment.Table 9.3.

This includes ben- efits in kind provided to help persons temporarily unable to work due to sickness or injury with daily tasks (home help, transport facilities, etc.) (COFOG, United Nations 1998 b). It is recommended to include under function HC.R.7 most payments falling under the Sick- ness function. The remaining items should be seen as a list of examples to be used in checking if cash benefits other than Sickness benefits are covered by health programmes (which is often the case for traditional social insurance coun- tries with a historically grown complex mix of services covered by \"health insurance \"). It would be desirable that, for health accounting, these supplementary benefits be shown separately in order to interpret aspects of financing (such as contribution rates) correctly.Table 9.4.

ICHA-HC F UNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE THE BORDERLINE BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES National Health Accounts draw different border- lines between health care and other social services across countries and comprise grey areas when social services involve a significant but not domi- nant health care component in, e.g., long-term care for dependent elderly people. This may be the case in home care, other forms of institutional care, such as protective custody in mental health insti- tutions, homes and protected working places for disabled persons, and rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts. The ground rule should be to report institutional care under health care where institutionalisation is necessary for the person 's health or where the health care component in question is most effi- ciently provided in an institutional setting. For other forms of care, where the medical compo- nent is important but not dominant (less than half of the total cost), a health care component could be separated by estimating genuine health care resources by evaluating their input in the form of labour and (intermediate) or final use of medicalANNEX 9.1. FURTHER BOUNDARY QUESTIONS OF HEALTH CARE goods. Only labour input of medical professions performing medical functions (in the sense of the ICHA functional classification) would be counted as a first approximation. In these cases, the ac- commodation function in these institutions would be excluded from the health care function. Non-medical components (in the above sense) of occupational and other rehabilitation programmes, with the goal of retraining and social and occupa- tional integration, should not be reported as health expenditure. Spa therapy sessions for mainly medi- cal and curative purposes should be distinguished from spa sessions for recreation or rehabilitation. THE BORDERLINE BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND OTHER MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS The application of medical knowledge and tech- nology pursued not for purposes of cure and re- lief but in the form of interventions aiming at enhancing human mental or physical capacity beyond natural limits or for other non-medical goals, may pose puzzling boundary issues in the future. Cosmetic surgery unrelated to the recon- struction of traumatic damages, in-vitroA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 130fertilisation, and brain chips for other than medi- cal-therapeutical or diagnostic purposes fall into this category. Doping and the intake of steroids in bodybuilding are other well-known examples. At the moment, health statistics usually include all services that are legal medical intervention on humans performed by licensed health profession- als. Thus, the decisive criterion is more whether the profession performing a task is officially recognised as belonging to the medical profession rather than whether the services rendered are health care in the sense of exclusively or predominantly aiming at enhancing the health of patients. For the time being, the quantities of resources involved may be negligible. In the future, more specific guidelines may have to be developed. THE BORDERLINE BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS A wide range of government functions outside of health care deal with public safety and the protec- tion of population health. For health accounting, the organisation and performance of these services has to be separated from the health care function. Ambulance and rescue services of a general nature but organised by fire-protection services belong to health care. Base hospitals belong to the health care function, not the military and civil defence. Medical facilities reserved for war or peacetime disaster, on the other hand, belong to public safety or the military and defence function. A range of public safety measures (road and vehicle safety, construction and housing standards, veterinarian services and product safety monitoring) are in some countries administered by public health au- thorities but are not included in the SHA bound- aries of health care.\u00a9 OECD 2000 1319.

The ICHA-HP provider classification (Table 10.1) is a refined and modified version of the health-relevant parts of the International Standard Industrial Classification, ISIC, Rev. 3 (United Nations, 1990). The majority of health care providers in that classification is contained in Section N, Health and Social Work (see also Annex A.5 of this manual). Health insurance, administration and social security are classified in ISIC under the insur- ance industry or public administration and compulsory social security. 10.2. The contents of individual categories of health care services under Health and Social Work is defined in ISIC under three broad terms of activities: Hospital activities (ISIC 8511), Medical and dental practice activities (ISIC 8512), and Other human health activities (ISIC 8519). Explanatory notes and further health-relevant industries in ISIC are listed in Annex A.5 of this manual with their original explanatory text. It is recommended that a well-defined link be established in actual data collections between the provider dimension of the System of Health Accounts and national industrial statistics. 10.3. For health accounting, more detailed explanations and a substantially longer list of health care providers are necessary than is provided by the ISIC. For the refinements of ISIC appropriate for the ICHA-HP classification, the draft common industrial classification of NAFTA coun- tries, the North American Industrial Classification System , NAICS 1998, served as a model for both basic definitions and for the presentation of specific items of the ICHA-HP . The terminol- ogy is modified in some instances to include additional material so as to better take into account the situation in other OECD countries or to abbreviate and simplify NAICS definitions. 10.4. Health accountants at national and cross-national levels should establish an exchange of information with the macro-economic accountants in their countries to ensure that healthA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 136care providers are allocated in the same way in both systems. This concerns, e.g. the clas- sification of hospitals as public or private corporations. The co-ordination of classifica- tions is particularly important regarding health care insurance, for which the SHA adopts the SNA 93 principles of breaking down insurance into social security, social insurance and other insurance enterprises. 10.5. In its present version, the institutional classification has been designed to allow cross- classification of expenditure on health reported under the medical functions (HC.1-HC.7). For health-related functions (such as education and R&D) specific institutional classifica- tions have been designed and recommended for international comparisons. These have not been reproduced here (see UNESCO/OECD/Eurostat, 1995, and the Frascati Manual , OECD, 1994 d). Table 10.1.

Hospitals may also provide out-patient services as a secondary activity. Hos- pitals provide in-patient health services, many of which can only be provided using the specialised facilities and equipment that form a significant and integral part of the production process. In some countries, health facilities need in addition a minimum size (such as number of beds) in or- der to be registered as a hospital.Table 10.1.

HP.2 Nursing and residential care facilities This item comprises establishments primarily en- gaged in providing residential care combined with either nursing, supervisory or other types of care as required by the residents. In these establish- ments, a significant part of the production pro- cess and the care provided is a mix of health and social services with the health services being largely at the level of nursing services. Note: a wide range of institutions providing long- term care (both health and social services) exists in most countries. The exact classification in the corresponding types of institutions (Nursing care facilities, Residential mental retardation, mental health and substance abuse facilities, Community care facilities for the elderly, Other residential care facilities) depends on the country-specific division of labour in the care process, especially in long- term care. As a general rule, in health accounting all institutions should be listed, where a consider- able share of all activities performed in that insti- tution have a medical component or consist ofnursing care with a strong medical component, usually performed by medical personnel acting as employees of the institution. But only an esti- mate to the medical part of expenditure of the establishments under HP .2 is recorded in the ex- penditure accounts of the SHA. Cross-references Institutions where medical interventions are moreof an incidental character or are performed by vis- iting doctors and/or nurses are excluded. This should also apply to institutions with a physician acting as director of e.g., a home for handicapped persons, where medical and nursing care accounts for only a small share of the overall activity of that institution. Another example of institutions of this type is residential homes for the elderly with visiting nurses. Nurses visiting these institutions should be reported separately as a corresponding category of ambulatory care (HP .3). /c72 /c80 /c46/c50/c46/c49 /c78/c117/c114/c115/c105/c110/c103/c32/c99/c97/c114 /c101/c32/c102/c97/c99/c105/c108/c105/c116/c105/c101/c115 This item comprises establishments gaged in providing in-patient nursing and reha- bilitative services. The care is generally provided for an extended period of time to individuals re- quiring nursing care. These establishments have a permanent core staff of registered or licensed practical nurses who, along with other staff, pro- vide nursing and continuous personal care services. Note: medical nursing care facilities provide pre- dominantly long-term care but also occasionally acute health care and nursing care in conjunction with accommodation and other types of social support such as assistance with day-to-day living tasks and assistance towards independent living. Nursing homes provide long-term care involving regular basic nursing care to chronically ill, frail, disabled or convalescent persons or senile persons placed in an in-patient institution. Health care and treatment have to constitute an important partA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 140of the activities provided to be included in the SHA.

ICHA-HF CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING OVERVIEW 11.1. The study of health care financing in health accounts starts with the basic sectoral division of the national accounts, i.e. government agencies, public and private insurance. Table 11.1 shows the proposed ICHA-HF classification of sources of funding. It is recommended that use be made of SNA 93 guidelines for allocating sources of funds to the categories of the ICHA-HF classification. Consultation between statisticians responsible for the SHA and their colleagues of national accounting should ensure that sources of funding are allo- cated in the same way in the two reporting systems. 11.2. When consumption is recorded on an expenditure basis, the purpose is to identify the institutional units that incur the expenditure and hence control and finance the amounts of such expenditure. The first step towards a cross-classification of expenditure on health and their financing will be to recall some basic definitions of national accounting and how they apply to total expenditure on health and its components. 11.3. The ICHA-HF classification follows the first three levels of the decision tree for classify- ing health insurance (Figure 11.1). There is a basic distinction between social health insurance and other health insurance. Social insurance is either organised and con- trolled at various levels of government or organised privately. The ICHA-HF does not distinguish between funded and unfunded insurance, although different estimation methods may correspond to these two forms of insurance (see SNA 93, Annex IV for more detail).A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 152Figure 11.1. SNA classification of health insurance Other health ins urance corporations (mainly individual contracts) Funded UnfundedSocial security (organised and controlled by government for the population at large) Funded by health insurance corporationsUnfundedPrivate social health insuranceSocial health insurance (obligation/encouragement for participation by law or employment; individual or group contracts)Health ins urance SOCIAL INSURANCE AND SOCIAL SECURITY 11.4. Social health insurance exists in different institutional forms, according to the regulations governing the individual insurance funds. Moreover, it is not always easy to draw an appropriate boundary line between social health insurance and privately funded and un- funded health insurance. Guidelines for this distinction are provided by SNA 93, Annex IV. 11.5. A social health insurance is one where the policy-holder is obliged or encouraged to insure by the intervention of a third party. For example, government may oblige all employees to participate in a social security programme; employers may make it a condition of employ- ment that employees participate in an insurance programme specified by the employer; an employer may encourage employees to join a programme by making contributions on behalf of the employee; or a trade union may arrange advantageous insurance cover avail- able only to the members of the trade union. Contributions to social insurance programmes are usually paid on behalf of employees, though under certain conditions non-employed or self-employed persons may also be covered. 11.6. An insurance programme is designated as a social insurance programme if at least one of the following three conditions are met (SNA 93, Annex IV, para. 4.111): participation in the programme is compulsory either by law or by the conditions ofemployment; or the programme is operated on behalf of a group and restricted to group members; or an employer makes a contribution to the programme on behalf of an employee. 11.7. Social security funds are social insurance programmes covering the community as a whole or large sections of the community that are imposed and controlled by a government unit. They generally involve compulsory contributions by employees or employers or both, and\u00a9 OECD 2000 15311. ICHA-HF C LASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING the terms on which benefits are paid to recipients are determined by a government unit. Social security funds have to be distinguished from other social insurance programmes which are determined by mutual agreement between individual employers and their employees. 11.8. Social security funds may be distinguished by the fact that they are organised separately from the other activities of government units and hold their assets and liabilities separately from the latter. They are separate institutional units because they are autonomous funds, they have their own assets and liabilities and engage in financial transactions on their own account. The amounts raised, and paid out, in social security contributions and benefits may be deliberately varied in order to achieve objectives of government policy that have no direct connection with the concept of social security as a scheme to provide social benefits to members of the community (SNA 93, Annex IV, para. 4.112) 11.9. It should be noted that the SHA recommends following the SNA 93 rule on how to treat programmes that are set up by governments for their employees only. These programmes are not to be regarded as social security funds. Table 11.1.

Included are non-market non-profit institutions that are con- trolled and mainly financed by government units. Note: for more detailed definitions and guidelines for sectoring financing units in the ICHA-HF institutional units of cen- tral, state or local government. Included are non- market non-profit institutions that are controlled and mainly financed by government units (SNA 93, 4.113). Note: the importance of financing in health care by state budgets depends on the basic organisation of a country 's health care system. Financing out of the state budget constitutes the major form of health care financing in highly integrated health care systems, where government bodies on state and regional levels are directly responsible for both financing and producing health care services. The share of government financing is usually less im- portant in countries with a health care system of the \"social insurance-type \", where social security funds act as intermediary financing funds. In every OECD country, governments are at least partly responsible for health care financing, by caring for specific groups of the population (the elderly, unemployed, pensioners, those living on social aid, etc.). Government bodies also play an important role in health care by subsidising pro-viders, and through financing capital formation of government owned provider institutions. HF.1.1.1 Central government This item comprises all institutional units mak-ing up the central government plus those NPIs that are controlled and mainly financed by cen- tral government (SNA 93, 4.117-4.122). HF.1.1.2 State/provincial government The state/provincial government sector consists ofstate governments which are separate institutional units plus those NPIs that are controlled and mainly financed by state government. \"States \" and \"provinces \" may be described by different terms in different countries. In small countries, indi- vidual states/provinces and state/provincial 4.123-4.127). HF.1.1.3 Local/municipal government The local government sub-sector consists of localgovernments that are separate institutional units plus those NPIs which are controlled and mainly financed by local governments. In principle, local govern- ment units are institutional units whose fiscal, legis- lative and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for admin- istrative and political purposes (SNA 93, 4.128). Note: local government units may be described by different terms in different countries. Alternative terms are e.g. \"municipalities \" or \"counties \". Units of local government supplying health care on a non-market basis remain an integral part of the local government unit to which they belong (SNA 93, 4.129). /c72 sub-sector consists of the social security funds operating at all levels of gov- ernment. Social security funds are social insur- ance schemes covering the community as a whole\u00a9 OECD 2000 15511. ICHA-HF C LASSIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING or large sections of the community and that are imposed and controlled by government units (SNA 93, 4.130). Note: more detailed definitions and guidelines for social security and other social insurance are given in the introductory text of the chapter. HF.2 Private sector This sector comprises all resident institutional units which do not belong to the government sector. Note: for a breakdown of health spending by source of funding, it is recommended to distinguish at least the following five sub-sectors: private social insurance, private insurance enterprises (other than social insurance), private household out-of-pocket expenditure, NPISHs and corporations (other /c46/c50/c46/c49 /c80/c114/c105 /c118 /c97/c116/c101/c32/c115/c111/c99/c105/c97/c108/c32/c105/c110/c115/c117/c114 /c97/c110/c99/c101 This sector comprises all social insurance funds other than social security funds. Includes: programmes that are set up by govern- ment for their employees only. Note: for the definition of social insurance see the introduction of this chapter for more insurance enter- prises other than social insurance. Note: this sector comprises both for-profit and non-for-profit insurance schemes other than so- cial insurance. See the introduction to this chap- ter for the definition of social insurance schemes and Chapter 6 for the differences in reporting con-tributions and insurance premiums between so- cial insurance and of a household which is adopted by survey statisticians familiar with the socio- economic conditions within a given country is likely to approximate closely the concept of a household as defined in the SNA and consequently will also be in most cases appropriate for the purposes of health accounting (see SNA 93, 4.134). Note: for a more detailed breakdown of out-of- pocket payments by private household, the fol- lowing definitions are relevant (adapted from the glossary in OECD, 1992, p. 9): out-of-pocket payments : payments borne directly by a patient without the benefit of insurance. They include cost-sharing and informal pay- ments to health care providers; cost-sharing : a provision of health insurance or third-party payment that requires the individual who is covered to pay part of the cost of health care received. This is distinct from the pay- ment of a health insurance premium, contri- bution or tax which is paid whether health care is received or not. Cost-sharing can be in the form of deductibles , co-insurance or co-payments ; co-payment : cost-sharing in the form of a fixed amount to be paid for a service. co-insurance : cost-sharing in the form of a set proportion of the cost of a service. In France and Belgium, \"ticket mod \u00e9rateur \". deductibles : cost sharing in the form of a fixed amount which must be paid for a service be- fore any payment of benefits can take place. Private funding is at the moment the least reliable component of health care financing (mainly due to uncertainties with respect to the amount of out- of-pocket payments to health care providers andA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000 156pharmacies) and also one of the major sources of estimation error in total expenditure on health in many countries. Data sources for a detailed break- down of out-of-pocket financing by private house- holds are consequently one of the weak points on existing health accounts in many countries. For this reason, more specific household surveys for tracking private expenditure on a regular basis are households (NPISHs) consist of non-profit institutions which provide goods or services to households free or at prices that are not economically significant (SNA 93, 4.64). Note: relevant as sources of funding of health care are in particular charities, relief or aid agencies that are created for philanthropic purposes and not to serve the interests of the members of the associa- tion controlling the NPISH. Such NPISHs may provide health care goods or services on a non- market basis to households in need, including households affected by natural disasters or war. The resources of such NPISHs are provided mainly by donations in cash or in kind from the general public, corporations or governments. They may also be provided by transfers from non-residents, including similar kinds of NPISHs resident in other countries 93, 4.67). /c72 /c70 /c46/c50/c46/c53 /c67/c111/c114/c112/c111/c114 /c97/c116/c105/c111/c110/c115/c32/c40/c111/c116/c104/c101/c114/c32/c116/c104/c97/c110/c32/c104/c101/c97/c108/c116/c104 /c105/c110/c115/c117/c114 /c97/c110/c99/c101/c41 This sector comprises all corporations or quasi- corporations whose principal activity is the pro- duction of market goods or services (other than health insurance).

Human Resources in Health Care (HRHC) or the equivalent concept of medical and para-medical personnel describe the special skilled labour force necessary for providing qualified health care. The defining criteria are field of study , educational level , and profession . To establish and maintain a coherent system for monitoring stocks and flows of health care per- sonnel on national level and to integrate these into a system which is capable of showing the links to the education of health care personnel as well as to health accounts, serves as a multi-purpose tool for: linking manpower data to the financial data ofthe SHA; planning of education and employment inhealth care;ANNEX A.1. MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN HEALTH CARE projections of the potential labour force for health care. The establishment of statistical links between data on personnel and health accounts in monetary terms is indispensable to track the employment effects of health care industries and productivity trends in care provision. The basic ideas of the following guidelines for the measurement of human resources in health care and essential parts of the methodology for the col- lection, interpretation and analysis of statistics on health care personnel have been borrowed from the OECD/Eurostat Canberra Manual on the Mea- surement of Human Resources Devoted to Science and T echnology (OECD/Eurostat, 1995) with some changes to the text to apply it specifically to health. It should, however, be noted that the concept of HRHC defined in this annex covers only part of the total employment in health care. Measures of overall employment in health care are given be- low (see standard Table 10 in Chapter 2 of this manual as well as Chapter 4).A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000160Available information about HRHC A number of national and international data sets contain information about HRHC. Their cov- erage and reliability vary both across data sets and over time, as commented in the OECD Health Data sources and methods. Medical and para- medical personnel (number of physicians, den- tists, and other medical professionals) have been included in several international data bases. The quality of this data, however, differs substantially. Unqualified international comparisons of, for ex- ample, physicians per 100 inhabitants, or similar indicators can be misleading. Data used in international comparisons stem, in many cases, from data sets of national ad- ministrative records. Problems arise because the methodologies and classifications are fre- quently incompatible and collection systems still differ widely. Available information on HRHC can be seriously biased when data is collected from registries of qualified personnel. These registers do not provide sufficient infor- mation regarding the number of personnel ac- tive in the field, nor do they indicate the hours worked, etc. The scope of HRHC: basic concept Human Resources in Health Care (HRHC) or the equivalent concept of medical and para-medical personnel describe the special skilled labour force necessary for providing qualified health care. The defining criteria are field of study , educational level , and profession . HRHC should be distinguished from total em- ployment in health care industries which is a more comprehensive concept that includes all persons employed by health care provider industries irre- spective of whether they belong to health care pro- fessions or not ( i.e. including administrative staffand staff ancillary to health care). Besides, not all medical and para-medical personnel are actually employed in health care (or in the active labour force). HRHC refers to medical and para-medical per- sonnel actually or potentially performing the functions HC.1 to HC.7 of the ICHA classifica- tion as health care professionals with skills ob- tained through education , which usually gives rise to formal qualifications in the form of degrees or diplomas. To become an active member in a category of HRHC often requires additional registration or accreditation . Before commencing a profession, such as a family doctor, legal procedures are usu- ally required. Registration or accreditation pro- cedures may vary substantially across countries. Moreover, different registration procedures may be necessary for the same person and the same job in order to establish contracts with different funders ( e.g. a doctor working in a private prac- tice for both private insurance and under public programmes). As registries do not predominantly serve statisti- cal purposes, their quality as a data source has to be scrutinised. The criteria applied in accredita- tion are not uniform across OECD countries and a doctor loosing his or her accreditation ( e.g., due to a legal dispute in one country), may opt to go to another country or take a health care job of a different qualification (normally lower) which in both cases allows him or her to still be counted under an HRHC category. For this reason, regis- tration (accreditation) has not been selected as a statistical criterion when qualifying a person in a HRHC category. Not every person actually or potentially engaged in health care activities or occupations is moni- tored under HRHC principles, only those with a\u00a9 OECD 2000 161ANNEXES minimum level of skills. The chief focus is on compiling and analysing data concerning HRHC categories with university level education, followed by HRHC categories with non-university level education. The following sections suggest a number of break- downs for HRHC statistics, and cross-reference them with international classifications and the ICHA provider classification. They deal with the level and field of study of HRHC, their labour force status, occupations, and institutional cat- egory of providers for those in employment. Some further information (age, gender, national origins, etc.) may be usefully compiled to supplement ba- sic HRHC data. DEFINING CRITERIA FOR HRHC T wo main systems can be used to identify HRHC: by qualification (people with the formal educa- tion which allows them to be so employed; complemented by accreditation where required) and by occupation (people employed in health care activities at the appropriate level). The selection of either approach as the primary dimension of analysis will depend on the question being con- sidered. Data on occupation relates to demand- side or utilisation issues such as \"How many people are actually employed as HRHC? \" Data on quali- fication is useful when looking at supply-side is- sues such as \"What is the pool of people potentially available to work in health care? \" The basic defi- nition recommended here follows the qualifica- tion dimension. It is important to recognise that not all those with the appropriate qualifications will necessarily be employed in their corresponding health care oc- cupations. Some will be inactive (retired, unem- ployed, etc.), others will be employed in non-health care occupations (clerical staff, policy- makers). The interest here is to distinguish be-tween occupations which form part of a \"health care career \" and those which do not. HRHC comprises people who have success- fully completed education at the third level in a medical field of study. Levels of education are defined in the UNESCO International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) (UNESCO, 1996) . Education at the third level covers studies leading to a first or higher university degree and also other studies at post- secondary level leading to awards not fully equiva- lent to a first university degree (formal definitions of these categories are given below). Successfully completed education at a given level leads to a formal qualification. Occupation is defined in terms of jobs (or posts). A job is a defined set of tasks and duties carried out (or meant to be carried out) by one person. Jobs require skills which may be acquired via edu- cation or on-the-job training. In theory, persons may be classified by occupations in terms of a past, present or future job. The definition re- lates to current employment only. Employment in turn refers to any kind of work, even as little as several hours per week, for pay (paid employ- ment) or profit (self-employment) during a ref- erence period. Examples of HRHC: qualified and employed as HRHC: physician working in a hospital; qualified nurse working in a community centre; dentist practising in his/her own dental office. qualified as HRHC but not so employed: unemployed physician; qualified nurse staying at home to raise his/her children; researcher in the pharmaceutical industrywith a university degree in medicine.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000162HEALTH PROFESSIONS BY EDUCATION : ISCED To obtain internationally compatible data, stan- dard classifications are applied to define \"educa- tion at the third level in a medical field of study \" and \"health care occupation \". The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), UNESCO (1996), is the most relevant source here. It is a classification both of levels of education and fields of study. Levels of education ISCED distinguishes seven levels of education (to- gether with a residual category for education not definable by level), grouped into three broad lev- els. For the purpose of defining HRHC, the third level of education is relevant. This comprises ISCED categories 5, 6 and 7, which are defined as follows: ISCED category 5: \"education at the third level, first stage, of the type that leads to an award not equivalent to a first university degree \"; ISCED category 6: \"education at the third level, first stage, of the type that leads to a first uni- versity degree or equivalent \"; ISCED category 7: \"education at the third level, second stage, of the type that leads to a post- graduate university degree or equivalent \". Hence attributions should be made on the basis of the highest qualification that a person holds: university-level qualifications are defined ascovering ISCED levels 6 and 7; non-university level qualifications are definedas covering ISCED level 5. HRHC can hence be split into three major cat- egories according to the level of degree: degrees from paramedical schools (ISCEDlevel 5); undergraduate degrees from medical/paramedi-cal departments of schools and universities(ISCED level 6); graduate degrees from medical/biomedical de- partments of universities (ISCED level 7). Field of study ISCED defines medical sciences as one among twenty-one main fields of study. Medical and health related programmes are: \"Medicine, surgery and medical specialities, hygiene and public health, physiotherapy and occupational therapy; nurs- ing, midwifery, medical X-ray techniques and other programmes in medical diagnostic and treat- ment techniques; medical technology, dentistry, stomatology and odontology, dental techniques, pharmacy, optometry, other. \" (UNESCO, 1996) HEALTH PROFESSIONS BY OCCUPATIONS : ISCO Coverage of HRHC in terms of occupation The starting point for classifying occupations is the International Standard Classification of Oc- cupations (ISCO) (ILO, 1990 a). ISCO-88 dis- tinguishes between ten major professional groups. T wo are of specific interest to HRHC: \"Profes- sionals \" (major group 2) and \"Technicians and associate professionals \" (major group 3). In the ISCO, occupations usually correspond to unique educational levels. Table A1.1 provides a comprehensive list of medical professions in ISCO major groups 2 and 3. For health and social ser- vices occupations, however, the ISCO states that: \"It became apparent that differences in formal educational requirements were most prominent in the cases of some of the teaching, health and social services occupations . In some countries, it is necessary to have a university degree in or- der to be able to practise these occupations, while in other countries lower-level educational certificates are considered sufficient. In order to accommodate these differences, parallel oc-\u00a9 OECD 2000 163ANNEXES cupational groups were created in ISCO-88 major groups 2 and 3 - Professionals and T ech- nicians and associate professionals, respec- tively. \" (ISCO-88, p. 8) The Professionals group (major group 2) is de- fined as follows: \"This major group includes occupations whose main tasks require a high level of professional knowledge and experience in the fields of physi- cal and life sciences, or social sciences and hu- manities. The main tasks consist of increasingthe existing stock of knowledge, applying sci- entific and artistic concepts and theories to the solution of problems, and teaching about the foregoing in a systematic manner. Most occu- pations in this major group require skills at the ISCED categories 6 or 7. \" (ILO, 1990 a, p. 6) Using this definition, all people working in ISCO major group 2 can be considered HRHC. The reverse is not true; not all university-level HRHC are employed in ISCO major group 2. They may work in other occupations, including groups 0Table A1.1.

The T echnicians and associate professionals group (major group 3) is defined as follows: \"This major group includes occupations whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of physical and life sciences, or social sciences and humanities. The main tasks consist of carrying out techni- cal work connected with the application of concepts and operational methods in the above- mentioned fields, and in teaching at certain education levels. Most occupations in this major group require skills at the ISCED cat- egory 5 \". (ILO, 1990 a, p. 6) Boundaries of HRHC and related occupations In addition to ISCO groups 2 and 3, some HRHC-relevant occupations may be identified in major group 1 ( \"Legislators, senior officials and managers \"), especially among the managers. The following subgroups seem to be of specific inter- est: \"Directors and chief executives \" (subgroup 121), \"Production and operations department managers \" (subgroup 122), and \"General manag- ers\" (subgroup 131). Managers employed in health care activities (122) are either also qualified at the appropriate level in a medical field of study or should be excluded from HRHC. This means that members of the management will be HRHC only by qualification, not on the basis of their occupation. Moreover, Table A1.1 does not list the unit groups 2113 Chemist, pharmaceutical, and 2212 Phar- macologist, pathologists and related profession- als, professions assumed to work mainly in health R&D. Professions that are not HRHC according to the definition suggested in this annex, include 3443 Government social benefits officials, 2445/ 2446 Welfare/Social work professionals and 3460Social work associate professionals, though some persons in the latter two categories may perform genuine health care tasks. Persons employed as personal care workers without qualifications at ISCED and above should be excluded from HRHC. Corresponding ISCO categories are 5132 Institution-based personal care workers, 5133 Home-based personal care workers, and 5139 Personal care and related workers n.e.c. TOTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES EMPLOYMENT A working definition Total health care services employment is the num- ber of full-time equivalent persons employed in health care service industries in the institutional boundaries proposed in Chapter 4 and further elaborated in Chapter 5. Besides employment of HRHC personnel, administrative, technical and other supportive staff are included as are person- nel working for profit and non-profit medical ben- efit insurers. Excluded are health professionals working outside health care services ( e.g. physi- cians employed in industry). Also excluded are employees of pharmaceutical and medical equip- ment manufacturing (Other medical industries , see Chapters 4 and 5). Generally speaking, all employment involved in the intermediate produc- tion of health care service industries should be excluded. HRHC by industries of employment It is important to know the industries of employ- ment in order to understand the spread of HRHC across the health care system. This breakdown will be related to HRHC in employment, due to the difficulties in classifying unemployed and es- pecially those out of the labour force by industry. It is recommended that personnel according to institutional categories of the ICHA-institutional classification should be recorded for HRHC.\u00a9 OECD 2000 165ANNEXES HEAD-COUNT OR FULL-TIME EQUIVALENCE ? T wo approaches are of interest when measuring hu- man resources: head-count data and full-time equiva- lence (FTE) data. In the head-count series people are, in principle, counted once (at a given moment in time) and classified once according to relevant criteria. In the FTE series the head-counts of per- sons working part-time or on several jobs or activi- ties are reduced to actual or normal working time. Head-count data is most commonly used because it is normally easier to collect and compare while the concept of full-time equivalence may some- times be more subjective or less easily understood. Availability of head-count statistics may be a pre- requisite for calculating the corresponding FTE data. The final choice between head-counts and FTE depends on what has to be measured. The FTE approach is preferable for specific issues, such as measuring health care activities, or when there are significant numbers of part-time jobs, as is fre- quently the case in health care. Measuring FTEs is indispensable for linking data on personnel to value added series in the SHA and in calculating non-market production and productivity trends. Head-count Head-count data is useful for the measurement of both stocks and flows. It allows the analysis to be related to the educational supply data and the flows in the system, as well as to other kinds of statistics based on the individual (such as demographic and employment statistics). By comparing data for several points in time, this approach makes it pos- sible to calculate net changes in the HRHC stock and average growth rates. Three options for measurement in terms of head- count are in principle available: the number of HRHC on a given date (for number HRHC total number of HRHC during the (calen-dar) year. The first and second options appear to be most relevant for the measurement of HRHC stocks, and are those generally used for other statistics of human resources (employment, recruitment, etc.) with annual or quarterly survey periodicity. The third option appears to be more suited for mea- suring flows or for deriving flow data from stock series for persons who are HRHC only by reason of their occupation. If such a person joins and leaves a health care occupation several times within a year, he/she is counted several times in the third option but only once, if at all, in the others. There- fore, a comparison between stock figures based on first and second options and third option gives a rough idea about multiple flows, possibly more at micro levels, for measuring the HRHC in spe- cific areas with high staff mobility or turnover (as may be the case in nursing professions). Full-time equivalence (FTE) FTE conversions vary across countries but are taken, unless otherwise noted, to be 35 hours or more per week and a gradual convergence to consensus with rules of SNA 93 (para. 17.14 to 17.18) is desirable. The FTE approach is ap- propriate when one wishes to use data on HRHC employment as a proxy for the amount (or the volume) of activities carried out or ser- vices supplied. For people with one major and one minor occu- pation, it may be possible to use modified head- count data by allocating individuals to their main activity. For example, in the case of a working student, the ILO specifies that the employment predominates. In other cases, calculation in FTE is the only efficient method.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000166The revised System of National Accounts (SNA 93, para. 15.102) suggests two approaches to measure FTE: total hours worked , which are the aggregate number of hours actually worked during the period in employee and self-employment jobs; full-time equivalent jobs , which are total hours worked divided by average annual hours worked in full-time jobs. The latter approach can be calculated more ap- proximately as \"number of jobs on a full-time ba- sis\". At present, it is the method most commonly used in national accounts satellite tables, but it is felt that it no longer deals with part-time employ- ment satisfactorily and the revised SNA recom- mends \"total hours worked \" as the best means for its main use of labour-input data, i.e. the mea- surement of productivity. A BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING EDUCATION AND PERSONNEL DATA A schematic model Stocks can be measured at many levels of detail, but the major policy interest is usually in national stocks. International flows of HRHC have long been monitored in connection with \"brain drain \" and \"brain gain \" issues for instance. Globalisation of health care and economic activities and hence of work and residence patterns hinders the mea- surement of national stocks of HRHC defined in terms of residence. The System of National Ac- counts sets out guidelines for dealing with tradi- tional cases such as international organisations, embassies and foreign military bases. Furthermore, it is by no means unusual, at least within the EU area, for an HRHC to be officially resident in one country and work in another. Special arrangements are proposed to deal with people whose residence and employment vary, notably for the measure- ment and analysis of regional stocks of HRHC.Particular attention is paid to the \"pipeline \" of flows into the HRHC stock via the education sys- tem. This is very important for reasons of policy and planning as students, especially foreign stu- dents, receive separate treatment in national ac- counts and labour force data. It is important when measuring HRHC to distin- guish between stocks and flows. Stocks generally provide a snapshot picture at a particular point in time. Flows relate to movements in or out of a stock (inflows and outflows) over a given period, usually a year. An example of a stock figure is the number of Ph.D.s in medicine employed in a given country and institutional category of health care providers on a given date. An HRHC stock can be defined as the number of people at a particular point in time who fulfil the conditions of the definition of HRHC. HRHC flows can be defined as the number of people who do not fulfil any of the conditions for inclusion in HRHC at the beginning of a time period but gain at least one of them during the period (inflow) as well as the number of people who fulfil one or other of the conditions of the definition of HRHC at the beginning of a time period and cease to fulfil them during the period (outflow). An example of an HRHC inflow is the number of pharmacists graduating from a country 's universities in a given year. In principle a flow is either into the stock or out of it. It may also be useful to consider \"internal flows \", which can be defined as flows within a stock over a given time period. Internal flows of HRHC can be defined as people who are part of the HRHC stock, some of whose characteristics change during the time period considered with- out, however, losing the essential characteristics for inclusion in HRHC. Examples of internal flows of HRHC are people who change their cat- egory of provider institution of employment, or achieve a qualification at a higher ISCED level.\u00a9 OECD 2000 167ANNEXES Figure A1.1 shows the HRHC stocks (of a coun- try, for example) and the inflows and outflows, but not the internal HRHC flows and is illustra- tive only. Further subdivisions of the stocks and flows can be made showing more disaggregated levels. The national stock includes unemployed, inactive and retired people as well as those in work. It is worth describing the inflows and outflows from the HRHC stock of a country in more de- tail. On the day they successfully complete third- level education in a medical field of study, people enter the HRHC stock regardless of their other characteristics, such as employment status or na- tionality. A country 's HRHC stock can also in- crease through immigrants who are already qualified on entry. The outflows from the HRHC stock of a country are deaths, emigrants and people beyond an appropriately defined age limit (75 years or ten years after retirement). Qualified persons do not leave the national HRHC stock because of unemployment or retirement. The coverage of some of these external flows is described further in the following sections, dealing with the \"pipe- line\" from the higher education sector, and defin-ing the \"national \" aspect of national stocks and associated flows. According to a number of characteristics, the HRHC stock can be split into many subsets within a country or a region, for example: the stock of HRHC employed in key healthcare occupations, in total or by kind of occu- pation; examples: number of physicians, phar- macists, qualified nurses; stock of HRHC at a given educational level, intotal or by field of study; examples: number of Ph.D. holders, number of pharmacists with a Ph.D.; the stock of HRHC split according to gender,age, or other personal characteristics; exam- ples: number of female physicians aged under forty, number of female dentists. Flows, like stocks, can be subdivided in many dif- ferent ways, according to personal characteristics, geographical characteristics (place of departure or arrival), or type of flow. Three main categories of flows have already been identified - inflows, out- flows and internal flows - and types of inflows and outflows were illustrated in Figure A1.1.Figure A1.1. National stock and flows of HRHC: a schematic model Nati onal stock of HR HCHRHC inflows HRHC outflows Persons qualifying for the first time as health professions at ISCED level 5 or above Qualified immigrantsEmigrants Retirement and deathsA SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000168Examples of internal flows are: previously inactive people, entering a health care occupation, for example: a medical doc- tor returning to work after taking care of his or her children for some years; qualified persons becoming inactive, for exam-ple: family doctor retiring at the age of 60; qualified persons who were employed in ahealth care occupation and who move to a non- health care activity, for example: a physician becoming a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry; flows between different fields of health care ac-tivities, employment with different provider categories, or different status of employment; flows between ISCED levels 5, 6 and 7, forexample: a medical assistant successfully com- pleting university with a Ph.D.; flows between regions within countries, for example: nurses leaving the new Bundesl \u00e4nder in Germany to work in the old Bundesl \u00e4nder. The pipeline A leading inflow to a country 's stock of HRHC is the output of its higher education system. The flow into, through and out of higher education has beencalled the pipeline. There are a series of key flows and critical points in the pipeline, all of which can be relevant. The inflows and outflows are illustrated in Figure A1.2. Again, each of these flows can be considered separately by field of health care study, level of qualification, and in relation to personal characteristics, such as age, gender and nationality. Flows of foreign students have been shown sepa- rately in Figure A1.2 for three reasons. First, re- moving them from the HRHC figures may give a very different picture of trends in the \"national \" system. Second, they may be dealt with by differ- ent policy agencies ( e.g. development aid) and sub- ject to different regimes ( i.e. fees) within universities or colleges, and often have visas which preclude them staying on once they have gradu- ated. The third reason is that, for the revised Sys- tem of National Accounts, they are not resident in their country of study and thus, unless they become resident upon completing their studies, do not enter the host 's stock. Note that people entering third-level education ( \"in- puts\") or already in the pipeline ( \"throughputs \") are not HRHC until they graduate ( \"outputs \"). All the same, information on these first two categories Figure A1.2.

HRHC by labour force status The main focus tends to be on HRHC personnel with full-time, permanent jobs. Given develop- ments in the health care labour market, it is also important to identify part-time workers and, if possible, people with short-term contracts plus the number of unemployed. Similarly, HRHC out of the labour force must be divided between those who are still \"in the pipeline \" (notably postgradu- ate students), those who have left the system (the retired) and the rest. The categorisation shown in the list below is rec- ommended. With the exception of the breakdown of \"employees \", the categories are those proposed by the ILO Manual (ILO, 1990 b). In line with ILO recommendations, students and retired people who undertake any economic activity, how- ever small, during the reference period are to be treated as economically active (employed or un- employed). Only those with no economic activ- ity at all should be treated as out of the labour force (SNA 96, 6.19-6.22, Domestic and personal services for own final consumption within house- holds). Accordingly, the numbers of HRHC out of the labour force and attending educational in- stitutions will not be the same as the number of HRHC enrolled for full-time (let alone part-time) studies - a point to be remembered when data are being compiled from multiple sources. The dividing line (20 hours per week) between \"full-time \" and \"part-time \" refers to \"usual hours of work \", i.e. the modal value of \"time actually worked \" over a long period. In principle this breakdown should be applied to the national (or regional) stock in terms of residence. In order to do so it is necessary to ensure that the numbers inthe labour force include persons resident in the country but employed or registered as unemployed in another, and exclude persons employed (or reg- istered unemployed) in the country but not resi- dent there. The following breakdown shows types of data needed to build up the breakdown of national stocks. /c73/c110/c32/c116/c104/c101/c32/c108/c97/c98/c111/c117/c114/c32/c102/c111/c114 /c99/c101 part-time, permanent staff (normally defined as under 20 hours per week); short-term contract staff (defined as con-tracts having a duration of less than 3 years); self-employed Unemployed (and available for work) /c79/c117/c116/c32/c111/c102/c32/c116/c104/c101/c32/c108/c97/c98/c111/c117/c114/c32/c102/c111/c114 /c99/c101 attending educational institutions (for example postgraduate students not elsewhere classified); engaged in household duties (not elsewhereclassified); retired or old age n.e.c.; other inactive (infirmity, disablement, etc.) n.e.c.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000170It should be noted that, because of the rapid ad- vances in medical methodology, WHO decided that there should be no revision of the ICPM in conjunction with the Tenth Revision of the ICD (ICD-10, 1992). Only the basic structure of two- digit levels is reproduced in Table A2.1. For ex- planatory notes and further detail see WHO (1978).ANNEX A.2. INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF PROCEDURES IN MEDICINE The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was published by WHO in 1978 for trial purposes. This classification has been adopted by a few countries and used as a basis for national classifications of surgical opera- tions by a number of other countries. It is for this reason used as an illustrative reference at some instances in Chapter 9 of this manual. Table A2.1. ICPM chapters and divisions ICPM chapters 1. Procedures for medical diagnosis 2.

Notes on the general construction of the classification are summarised below (IC-Process-PC, 1986, p. 7). The recently published second edition of the In- ternational Classification of Primary Care (ICPM-2, 1998) provides a similar breakdown of procedures that is roughly compatible with the IC-Process-PC reproduced below. The IC- Process-PC provides more detail and precision and has for this reason been chosen instead of ICPM-2 for the purposes of the illustrations used in Chapter 9 on the ICHA-HC functional clas- sifications. The rubrics contained in this classification were selected because of frequency of uses as determined by field trials. The several sections of the classifi- cation are numbered from 1 to 9 as follows: site and duration of service;clinical laboratory; diagnostic imaging (including X-ray, nuclear scanning, ultra-sound, etc.); diagnostic procedures other than clinical labo-ratory and imaging; therapeutic procedures; therapeutic: drugs and pharmaceuticals; clinical and administrative services; disposition (follow-up). The arrangement of the sections of the classifica- tion are consistent with a logical progression of the patient 's encounter with a provider, begin- ning with the site and duration of services, pro- gressing through diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and concluding with plans for dis- position (follow-up). Section 6 and 7 \"Thera- peutic: drugs and pharmaceuticals \" occupies two sections because of the large number of rubrics required. The contents of Section 1 (Site and duration of service) and 9 (Disposition; follow up) are not listed in Table A3.1, as they are not relevant to the construction of the ICHA-HC functional classification.ANNEX A.3.

There exist in fact close links be- tween all these three classifications. These links are apparent for those health care services, which are defined in terms of provider industries. Health care services are defined in the CPC in group 931, Human health services, which com- prises three classes (Hospital services, Medical and dental services, Other human health services) and eight subclasses. The System of Health Accounts is based on a two- dimensional approach that classifies expenditure on health separately by function (ICHA-HC func- tional classification) and by provider industry (ICHA-HP provider classification). The broad categories of health care services provided by the CPC are, for this reason, not sufficiently mapped to ICHA (two-dimensional) entities to be of spe- cific use in the proposed health accounts. Rel- evant parts of the CPC are reproduced inANNEX A.4. HEALTH IN THE CENTRAL PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION Table A4.1 mainly to illustrate the structure be- hind the two related classifications, ISIC and SNA 93 functional classification, that are pre- sented in the subsequent Annexes A.5 and A.6 of this manual. The CPC references to services of accident and health insurance (Class 7132) and administrative health care services (Subclass 91122) are also provided in Table A4.1, followed by explanatory notes.

The ICHA-HP clas- sification of health care provider industries retains a basic compatibility with health care industries as defined in the ISIC - albeit only at an aggregate level. As has been stated, this manual recommends maintaining close links between the System of Health Accounts and industrial statistics. Table A5.1 shows the structure of health care service industries ac- cording to ISIC, Rev. 3 and is followed by explana- tory notes (United Nations, 1990, ISIC, Rev. 3).

Social security services may be defined as chiefly trans-fer payment to compensate for reduction or loss of income or inadequate earning capacity. Compul- sory social security normally covers sickness, acci- dent and unemployment insurance and retirement pensions. Also more specific risks leading to loss of income may be covered: maternity, temporary dis- ablement, widowhood, family increase. Exclusions: direct provision of welfare services and other social work with accommodation is classi- fied in class 8531, and without accommodation in class 8532, respectively.\u00a9 OECD 2000 181ANNEXES 851 Human health activities 8511 Hospital activities This class includes the activities of general and specialised hospitals, sanatoria, preventoria, asy- lums, rehabilitation centres, leprosaria, dental cen- tres and other health institutions that have accommodation facilities, including military base and prison hospitals.

Included are the activities of dental auxiliaries such as dental thera- pists, school dental nurses and dental hygienists, who may work remote from the dentist but who are supervised periodically by the dentist. Also included are clinics, pathological and other diag- nostic activities carried out by independent labo- ratories, of any kind, activities of blood banks, ambulance and air-ambulance activities, residen- tial health facilities except hospitals, etc. Exclusions : production of artificial teeth, dentures and prosthetic appliances by dental laboratories are classified in class 3311 (Manufacture of medi- cal and surgical equipment and orthopaedic ap- pliances). Testing activities in the field of food hygiene are classified in class 7422 (T echnical test- ing and analysis).A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000182The SNA 93 includes four classifications of ex- penditure according to purpose (formerly called functional classifications): \u007fCOICOP: Classification of Individual Con- sumption by Purpose; \u007fCOPNI: Classification of the Purposes of Non- profit Institutions Serving Households; \u007fCOFOG: Classification of the Functions of Government; \u007fCOPP: Classification of the Outlays of Pro- ducers by Purpose. \"Health \" is one of the purposes (functions) that is common to all four of these classifications. The distinction between individual and collective con- sumption is implemented in the revised system of classifications of expenditure according to purpose in the following way (United Nations, 1998 b, p. 5): \u007fCOICOP is used to classify individual con- sumption expenditure of households, NPISHs and general government; \u007fCOPNI and COFOG are used to classify a range of transactions, including outlays on fi- nal consumption expenditure, intermediate consumption, gross capital formation and capi-ANNEX A.6. HEALTH IN THE SNA CLASSIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO PURPOSE tal and current transfers, by NPISHs and gen- eral government respectively; \u007fCOPP is used to classify intermediate con- sumption and capital outlays of financial and non-financial corporate and unincorporated enterprises. This annex lists relevant health sections of the SNA 93 functional classifications for reference in health accounting. More detail can be found in United Nations (1998 b). Table A6.1 provides an overview on health care items in the four classifi- cations.\u00a9 OECD 2000 183ANNEXES Table A6.1.

COICOP classes are divided into services (S), non-durables (ND) and semi- durables (SD) and durables (D). This allows analy- sis of goods that are identified as durables as stock of goods for use similar to capital goods. The SHA, however, does not use this subdivision for final consumption of health care goods and services.Health in COICOP (private households): definition by class /c48 /c54 /c46 /c72/c101/c97/c108/c116/c104This division also includes health services pur- chased from school and university health centres. 06.1 Medical products, appliances and equipment This group covers medicaments, prostheses, medi- cal appliances and equipment and other health- related products purchased by individuals or households, either with or without a prescription,A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 200018406.2 Out-patient services This group covers medical, dental and paramedi- cal services delivered to out-patients by medical, dental and paramedical practitioners and auxilia- ries.

Hospital day care and home-based hospital treatment are included as are hospices for terminally-ill persons. This group covers the services of general and spe- cialist hospitals, the services of medical centres, maternity centres, nursing homes and convales- cence homes which chiefly provide in-patient health care, the services of institutions serving old people in which medical monitoring is an essential component and the services of rehabili- tation centres providing in-patient health care and rehabilitative therapy where the objective is to treat the patient rather than to provide long- term support. Hospitals are defined as institutions which of- fer in-patient care under direct supervision of qualified medical doctors. Medical centres, ma- ternity centres, nursing homes and convales- cent homes also provide in-patient care but their services are supervised and frequently delivered by staff of lower qualification than medical doctors. This group does not cover the services of facili- ties, such as surgeries, clinics and dispensaries,devoted exclusively to out-patient care (06.2). Nor does it include the services of retirement homes for elderly persons, institutions for disabled per- sons and rehabilitation centres providing prima- rily long-term support (12.4). 06.3.0 Hospital services (S) Hospital services comprise the provision of thefollowing services to hospital in-patients: \u007fBasic services: administration; staff (nursing auxiliaries); first- aid and resuscitation; ambulance transport; provision of medicines other pharmaceu- tical provision of therapeutic appli- ances services: services of physicians in gen- eral or specialist practice, of surgeons and of dentists; medical analyses and X-rays; para- medical services such as those of nurses, mid- /c118/c105/c99/c101/c115 12.5 Insurance Service charges for insurance are classified by type of insurance, namely: life insurance and non- life insurance (that is, insurance in connection with the dwelling, health, transport, etc.). Ser- vice charges for multi-risk insurance covering several risks should be classified on the basis of the cost of the principal risk if it is not possible to allocate the service charges to the various risks covered. Service charge is defined as the difference between claims due and premiums earned and premium supplement. 12.5.3 Insurance connected with health (S) \u007fService charges for private sickness and acci- dent insurance.A SYSTEM OF HEALTH ACCOUNTS \u00a9 OECD 2000186Health in COICOP (NPISHs): definition by class 13.2 Health The same function is covered under COPNI Groups 02.1 to 02.6.
