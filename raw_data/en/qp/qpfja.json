Think of your immune system as your body's security detail. It helps repel foreign invaders like bacteria, parasites and viruses. Our Immune Boost program is designed to help you maintain a robust immune system through a comprehensive combination of Acupuncture, Injection Therapies, and Physician-Grade Supplements specifically formulated for immune health. Initial Consultation Required An initial consultation with Dr. Smithmyer is required to find out if you are a candidate for Immune Boost. If you are determined to be a candidate, we can perform your first procedure the same day. Immune Boost Program Highlights Increases T Cells Studies show regular acupuncture treatments can actually increase the number of T cells the body produces. T cells destroy harmful bacteria and viruses in the body. The amazing part is the increased cellular response lasts for several days after treatment. Thus, receiving regular acupuncture treatments can actually prevent the body from getting sick. Returns Your Body To Homeostasis Acupuncture taps into the body's ability to heal itself, returning the body back to homeostasis. When acupuncture balances your body, your immune system skyrockets. Patients who were previously consistently ill (allergies, colds, flu, etc.) tell us that they have yet to feel sick since starting treatments. Fights Off Pathogens Acupuncture regulates immune function while speeding up the healing of infection and normalizing the body's immune response. A boosted immune system can also help fight off pathogens. Injection Therapies Vitamin B-12 Did you know that vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin that your body needs, but cannot produce on its own? It plays an important role in white blood cell production which is essential for proper immune system functioning. At Chesapeake AIM we offer the most effective and efficient method, B12 Injections! Vitamin D3 Vitamin D has several important functions. Perhaps the most vital are facilitating normal immune system function and regulating the absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Getting a sufficient amount of vitamin D is important for normal growth and development of bones and teeth, as well as improved resistance against certain diseases. Vitamin C Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is not only necessary for the growth, development and repair of all body tissues - it's involved in many body functions, including formation of collagen, absorption of iron, the immune system, wound healing, and the maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth.
