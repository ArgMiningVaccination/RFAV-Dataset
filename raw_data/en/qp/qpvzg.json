PrensIntroductionChapter 1 1213PREFACE Hidradenitis suppurativa is an underestimated serious skin disease, with debilitating consequences for the personal and professional lives of patients. The estimated prevalence of 1% is likely to be an undervaluation, since it is still often not recognized by physicians, despite increasing awareness for HS. In addition, there is a patient's delay in HS, as the patients hesitate to visit a physician, due to embarrassment for the disease, which can include lesions with foul smelling drainage. This often leads to a diagnostic delay of approximately seven years, in which the disease may progress. The exact pathophysiology of HS is not clarified yet and the clinical presentation is heterogeneous, which makes the treatment of HS challenging and the burden for patients tremendous. Medical and surgical interventions are the two main therapeutic approaches for HS. Even though the latter is less well investigated, it remains one of the most effective treatment options for HS. However, surgery itself can add to the burden of patients, as the experience can be traumatizing, leaving the patients with conspicuous scars. Moreover, the clinical appearance of HS often does not correspond with the patient's own experience of her or his disease. The chronic and unpredictable nature of HS can lead to fear, shame and inhibition of daily activities. Further increasing awareness and a better insight into the prevalence can help reduce the diagnostic delay and help initiate treatment earlier, decreasing the burden for the patient. Therefore, the general aim of this thesis is to gain more insight into the prevalence, treatment targets and outcomes and the extent of the burden of this disease. In this Introduction, current concepts on prevalence, pathophysiology and treatment modalities are summarized. In addition, the aims of the studies in this thesis are defined. PREVALENCE Hidradenitis suppurativa is thought to be a common disease. The prevalence of HS is approximately 1%, however studies to this date, show a wide range in prevalence, varying from 0.02% (Argentina) up to 4.10% (Denmark).1,2 For comparison, psoriasis affects approximately 2-3% of the world's population.3 A more recent Australian population based cross-sectional study reported a prevalence of 0.67% (95% CI 0.53-0.84) based on interviews with 11.433 adults.4 Another study, using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, found a prevalence of 0.77% (95% CI 0.76-0.78).5 An overview of these studies is shown in Figure 1 in Chapter 2 . The variations in prevalence are likely due to methodological differences between the studies; the different countries where the studies took place and differences in study populations. Naturally, each of these study types has its strengths and limitations, which are important to be aware of when interpreting the prevalence data. For example, data from registry-based studies have high specificity, but lower sensitivity due to detection and selection bias. Cases can be missed due to under- or misdiagnosis, miscoding or uninsured patients. Studies based on self-reported data have the highest sensitivity, meaning the most HS patients will be identified, but the specificity can be reduced due to false positives. It is imperative to gain insight into which extent HS affects the general population for multiple reasons. First, HS is fairly common and an increase in incidence of HS has been shown, based on current registry data from Norway and the USA.6-8 Introduction 114Second, HS causes a substantial impact on the quality of life (QoL) and is associated with both physical and mental comorbidities.9-11 Consequently, this could potentially form a burden for the health care system.12,13 Lastly, HS is predominantly present in patients who are in the active labour force.14-16 Consequently, HS can influence individual work productivity and social economic status, as well as the general economy. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of this disease and to diagnose and treat it as early as possible. CLASSIFICATION Hidradenitis suppurativa is a disease with dual characteristics: inflammation and formation of sinus-tracts and/or scarring, causing several clinical phenotypes, which are not properly defined and stratified yet. A solid phenotypic classification should result in an appropriate customized therapeutic approach. Several classification systems exist, however each one has its limitations. The original Hurley classification, introduced in 1989, is the most commonly used classification for staging the severity of HS in patients, in both daily practice and clinical trials.17 Recent validation of the original Hurley classification showed a moderate interrater reliability (=0.59; 95% CI, 0.48-0.70) and (95% CI, 0.58- 0.72), indicating a substantial reliability.18 However, this three-stage classification was initially designed to assess scarring in only one anatomical area, aiming to guide surgical treatment. The extent of disease and the presence of inflammation are not taken into account, rendering this system unsuitable to fully assess the severity of the disease. The refined Hurley was proposed in 2017 by the Dutch HS Expert group to enhance this original classification, aiming to stage patients more adequately and to provide therapeutic guidance for daily practice. Via the three-step algorithm, disease severity is determined by assessing the presence of sinus tracts; the grade of inflammation and the number of affected areas in the patient. The Hurley stages I and II are subdivided into mild (A), moderate (B) and severe (C), creating seven stages in total. An important consequence of this refinement is that patients in stage I (B or C) are now classified as having moderate or severe HS, and are therefore eligible to receive treatment with biologics. Before implementing this classification broadly in daily practice, a validation process of this classification was necessary. Construct validity was confirmed by the correlation of patient reported quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index, DLQI) and physician-assessed disease severity (International HS Severity Score System, IHS4) with the mild, moderate and severe categories of the refined Hurley classification.19 Additional intra- and interrater validations were required to determine the reliability of this refined classification, which we performed in Chapter 3 . Notably, the refined Hurley classification can be used as a self-assessment tool for patients, which is relevant for daily practice, as well as for questionnaire-based research ( Chapter 3 ). The use of digital applications is becoming more common in outpatient clinics as an aid for physicians.20 Based on the refined Hurley classification an application has been developed (Figure 1), to assist physicians to stage patients and to provide the proper therapeutic approach. Also, two other classifications for assessing phenotypes have been proposed and numerous instruments for assessing HS severity have been developed. One, by Canoui-Poitrine, identified the axillary-mammary type, follicular type and gluteal 15low interrater reliability (=0.37, 95% CI 0.32-0.42), it has limited use in daily practice.22 Another classification by van der Zee et al. identified six phenotypes based on expert opinion, but has not been validated yet.23 A systematic review assessing the validation of outcome measure instruments, used in clinical trials for HS, revealed that 90% of instruments lacked data on validation.24 An overview of these assessments with validation, if available, is shown in Table 1. Because of the heterogeneity and lack of validation of outcome measure instruments, comparing results of clinical trials, has been difficult. For this reason, core outcome measures for HS trials are being developed and outcome measurement instruments are being evaluated by the HISTORIC initiative, in order to determine the best instrument for measuring disease severity.25 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic and assumed auto-inflammatory skin disease. The pathogenesis multifactorial and not yet fully elucidated.11 Briefly, a key and early element in the pathogenesis of HS is the occlusion of the hair follicle with a keratin plug. Consequently, dilation of the follicle follows and eventually rupture of the follicle, leading to an aberrant and acute foreign body-like inflammatory response, which causes painful boils and abscesses in the skin of the patient. When the inflammation continues and reaches a chronic state, sinus tracts and scarring can develop (Figure 2). Exogenous factors as obesity and smoking, and endogenous aspects as genetic susceptibility lead to an immune cascade where almost all components of the immune system are involved at a certain stage of disease progression. Role of innate immunity The role of innate immunity and the overreaction of its components leading to an aggravated innate immune response are the presumed key players of the early inflammation in HS. Previous studies showed increased levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the IL-6, IL-17A and IL-23.26-28 Disappointingly, there are still no clinically applicable biomarkers in the blood for HS, which could aid in therapy Android iOS Apple Figure 1.

Except for elevated TNF- levels and increased CCL-26 expression, other inflammatory proteins were not detected or consistently found elevated in plasma of HS patients. Complement system The complement system is an ancient and complex component of our innate immunity and exists of approximately 50 proteins.29 Activation can be initiated via three distinct pathways: the classical, the alternative and the lectin pathway (Figure 3). Each pathway results in activation of C3, which consequently leads to activation of C5 and production of C5b-9 or the membrane attack complex (MAC). This complex can cause bacterial lysis via perforation of the bacterial cell wall. The anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, that are formed, have strong pro-inflammatory properties. The role of complement in HS controversial. There are no consistent findings on systemic complement activation in HS. Analysis of the sera of HS patients showed no elevation of IL-6, a marker of systemic complement activation.27,30 However, Kanni et al. reported higher levels of C5a and C5b-9 in the plasma of HS patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a role for complement in HS pathophysiology.31 Furthermore, the complement pathway was one of the top 10 upregulated canonical pathways in HS lesional skin.32 Moreover, a recent study by Gudjonsson et al. showed local deposition of complement components C1q, C3b, and C4d on immune cells in HS lesional skin.33 This controversy is also reflected by the different outcomes of clinical trials investigating the blockade of components of the complement system. The first clinical trial, an open-label, single-arm, phase 2a study (NCT03001622), investigating the efficacy of the C5a antibody IFX-1 (a monoclonal IgG4 antibody) showed promising results. Since HiSCR was achieved in 10 out of 12 patients.34 However, the subsequent SHINE phase IIb (NCT03487276) trial with IFX-1 (n=179), did not meet its primary endpoint (HiSCR) at week 16.35 Another clinical phase 2 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of the oral small molecule C5a receptor 1 inhibitor Avacopan is currently ongoing in the United States (NCT03852472). Preliminary data showed a statistically significant dose-dependent improvement in HiSCR versus placebo only in Hurley stage III patients at week 12.36 Role of adaptive immunity In parallel with innate immunity, adaptive immunity also takes part in the HS pathophysiology. In HS lesions, levels of several cytokines associated with T helper (Th) 17 cells, such as IL-1 and IL-17A, are elevated.37 This suggests a role for Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HS.38,39 An imbalance between the pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells may negatively affect homeostasis of the hair follicle stem cells, making the hair follicle more prone to rupture.40 Treatment with the TNF- inhibitor adalimumab reduced the number of Th17 cells in HS lesions and normalized the Th17/Treg ratio.38 In patients receiving adalimumab, the number of HS lesions significantly decreased during treatment.41 In HS lesional tissue, increased numbers of both plasma cells and B cells have been identified.33,42 However, the role of these cells in the pathogenesis of HS is still unclear. Currently, treatment targeting B cells is not being investigated.43 19One case report exists, concerning a kidney transplant recipient with HS, who was treated with two courses of low-dose rituximab (200 mg), which binds to CD20 causing B cell depletion. The improvement of HS in this patient was substantial without rejection of the transplanted kidney.44 Genetics in hidradenitis suppurativa A positive family history for HS is reported in approximately a third of the HS patients, suggesting that a genetic background increases susceptibility for developing HS.45 Moreover, Van Straalen et al. recently demonstrated a high heritability of hidradenitis suppurativa of 77% among both monozygotic and dizygotic twins, underscoring the genetic susceptibility in HS.46 Several mutations of -secretase complex (GSC) genes, such as NCSTN, PSENEN and PSEN1 and have been identified in a minority of patients with familial HS.47,48 The GSC is an intramembrane protease complex which cleaves various transmembrane proteins, such as Notch receptors.49 One theory states that mutations in this complex may prevent substrate binding and prevent Figure 3. Simplified overview of the BioRender.com Introduction 120intramembrane cleavage of Notch proteins.50 Consequently, Notch signaling may be impaired, which promotes inflammatory activity and dysregulates hair follicle keratinization, resulting in cyst formation.49 Environmental The microbiome is defined as 'a characteristic microbial community occupying a reasonable well- defined habitat which has distinct physio-chemical properties. [...] The microbiome, which forms a dynamic and interactive micro-ecosystem prone to change in time and scale, is integrated in macro- ecosystems including eukaryotic hosts, and here crucial for their functioning and health'.51 It can also be referred to as the metagenome of microbiota. Microbiota is generally defined 'as the assemblage of living microorganisms present in a defined environment'.51 Since formation of pus is a characteristic feature of HS, involvement of skin microbes in disease pathophysiology has been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment is the first line of treatment for HS. The skin microbiome in patients with HS differs significantly from healthy volunteers, in both lesional and non-lesional skin.52 More specifically, an increased abundance of Gram-positive Corynebacterium and a decreased abundance of Cutibacterium in active HS lesions was reported.53 Additionally, mixed anaerobic microbiota were associated with clinical severity.53 Moreover, appearance of bacterial biofilms in chronic lesions and sinus tracts has been identified, which might be promoted by nicotine through initial attachment of microorganisms.11,54 This dysbiosis in the skin microbiome might contribute to HS development. Along with the skin microbiome, a role for the gut microbiome has been hypothesized.55 A shift in gut microbiome, caused by a high fat diet, increases the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 by the epithelial cells in the gut. Consequently, levels of circulating IFN- and TNF- also increase, ultimately leading to skin inflammation and increased expression of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), of which MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HS lesional skin correlate with disease severity.55 Obesity and smoking Obesity and smoking are known risk factors for HS and are associated with increased HS severity.56,57 They both can lead to an increase in the Th17/Treg ratio, which contributes to the inflammation of the skin.40 The adipokines, cytokines secreted by adipose tissue, can induce inflammation as well as contribute to development of insulin resistance.58 Obesity also causes mechanical stress of the skin, due to increased friction in the skin folds, which can contribute to formation of HS lesions. Moreover, weight reduction of 15% or more already significantly improved HS symptoms.59 Two patients even achieved remission of HS after bariatric surgery.60 Over eighty percent of HS patients is either a current smoker or ex-smoker, making smoking the most common exogenous trigger for HS.61 Smoking promotes symptoms of HS and is considered to negatively impact healing of HS lesions.62,63 In addition, smoking leads to an increased frequency of Th17 cells and production of IL-17, and decreased numbers of T regulatory cells. Smoking is also associated with downregulation of the Notch pathway, which 21Introduction 1can promote cyst formation and inflammatory activity.40,64 Furthermore, nicotine also induces dysbiosis of the cutaneous microbiome.65 The components of tobacco smoke contain high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which can activate arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling. AhR is essential for Th17 cell polarization and immune regulation.40 Furthermore, AhR can induce DNA methylation changes, which leads to an increase of IL-6.58 Cessation of smoking should always be strongly advised to patients, as non- or ex-smokers have a better chance (odds ratio of 2.8) of remission of HS compared to smokers.56 Hormonal influence HS is three times more prevalent in women than in men, disease onset is frequently after puberty and perimenstrual flares have been observed.66-70 Studies assessing the influence of pregnancy on HS symptoms have shown contradicting results. One study reported worsening of HS symptoms in over 62% of pregnancies and improvement in only 8% of pregnancies.71 However, another study reported no apparent effect of pregnancy or menopause on HS symptoms.56 Vossen et al. reported improvement of symptoms during pregnancy in 30% of respondents with a significant correlation between perimenstrual worsening and amelioration of symptoms during pregnancy.56,72 Beneficial effects of anti-androgen treatment on HS in women have been reported, but the evidence is scarce.73,74 These observations indicate an influence of sex hormones on HS, however their exact role is still unclear, and interventions using anti-androgens are not recommended in the S1 European HS guideline.75 COMORBIDITIES Hidradenitis suppurativa is associated with several conditions, including other inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome and psychological disorders. Exploring associated comorbidities can potentially provide information on the pathophysiology of HS. Furthermore, occurrence of one or more of these comorbidities can influence the choice of treatment. Inflammatory disorders Metabolic syndrome This disorder is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a pathological condition, consisting of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.76 Metabolic syndrome is more common in HS patients, in up to 50% of patients, compared to controls.77,78 Patients with HS have an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and consequently have an increased risk for arteriosclerosis, infarction, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp and pilonidal sinus and can occur in conjunction with one another. As the name suggests, the occlusion of the follicle is the key event in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) HS can occur as part of a syndrome, such as the PASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, These entities share the pathomechanism of overactivation of innate immunity and are associated with overexpression of IL-1 and TNF-.81 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) The inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are both associated with HS and are 4 to 8 times more prevalent in HS patients.82 This indicates an increased risk for patients with HS to develop IBD, compared to the general population.11 Vice versa, HS appears also to more prevalent, up to 23%, in patients with IBD.83 Moreover, the treatment schedules of biologics for IBD appear to be more effective for treating HS patients, than for example the per label dosages for psoriasis. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) SpA is chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorder which shares clinical and pathophysiological features with HS. Both conditions are associated with IBD and with increased levels of IL-17A and TNF- cytokines.84 SpA is more prevalent among HS patients and similarly, HS is more prevalent among SpA patients compared to the general population.84,85 The IL-17A, and IL-17A plus IL-17F antagonists secukinumab and bimekizumab are currently being investigated in clinical trials as a new target for HS treatment. Secukinumab is already approved for treatment of SpA, while bimekizumab is also in the clinical trial phase. Psychological comorbidities Unsurprisingly, given the enormous burden of HS, depression and anxiety are both more commonly reported in HS patients.11 Prevalence rates for depression diagnosis vary, ranging from 1.6% up to 42.9%.6,86 Based on questionnaires assessing depression symptoms, a prevalence rate of up to 39% was reported.10 In these studies, severity of HS correlated significantly with depression scores.10 Prevalence of anxiety was approximately 5% among HS patients.87 Physicians treating patients with HS should be aware of, and anticipate on these important psychological comorbidities. Other comorbidities Hidradenitis suppurativa appears also to be associated with several genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome (abnormal expression of the gene encoding for APP on chromosome 23Introduction 121), Dowling-Degos (loss-of-function in keratin 5 gene), Familial (FMF; gene mutations), SAPHO and even malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma and lymphomas.11,63,88,89 However, further studies are required to confirm these associations. BURDEN OF DISEASE Quality of life The quality of life HS patients is known to be significantly impaired. They score higher on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), indicating a higher burden, than patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or non-melanoma skin cancer.90 The quality of life in HS is reduced, even when compared with high impacting diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and stroke.91-94 Additionally, patients with HS report higher scores on questionnaires assessing loneliness, social isolation and report lower self-esteem scores compared to healthy controls.95 Due to feelings of shame and fear of stigmatization, social isolation of these patients is promoted.10,96 Furthermore, the risk of suicide among HS patients is 2 to 5 times higher, compared to the general population, even after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking and alcohol abuse.10 The risk of suicide remains increased after adjusting for confounders, further emphasizes the severity of this disease and its psychological burden. Sexual health Patients experience a considerable impact on their sexual health, since HS is frequently located in the groin and anogenital area.97,98 Besides the location, HS can cause drainage of malodorous pus and can lead to scarring. Both can contribute to feelings of shame and embarrassment, which can strongly interfere with the sex life of patients.10 One study reported a three times higher impact on sexual health, compared to other dermatoses.99 However, other data assessing the sexual health of patients are scarce. Work ability Symptoms associated with HS do not only have a psychological influence but often impair patients daily activities.16 As the majority of HS patients are in their work-productive years, the impact of HS might be most prominent in their work environment. However, literature on the ability to work and function in day to day life of HS patients is limited. Hidradenitis was the cause of absenteeism (i.e. sick leave) in 58.1% of 30 investigated patients, with a mean absence from work of 34 days over the course of one year.14 Because of the unpredictable and painful nature of HS, it is difficult for patients to maintain their job or fully function during flares. The unemployment rate in patient with HS is four times higher compared to the general population (25.1% versus 6.2%) in Denmark.100 Furthermore, being able to work can significantly contribute to overall well-being.101 As HS patients have a substantial lower quality of life, achieving disease control is extremely important for these patients.24TREATMENT Achieving complete disease control is still challenging with the currently available treatment options. Moreover, for the available options there is little supporting evidence, as clinical trials are scarce. The therapeutic goal is two-fold: long-term disease control and management of acute flares. This dual aim is mostly achieved by combining medical and surgical interventions. The timing of each of these interventions is essential, which adds to the complexity of managing HS. As generally evidence is lacking on this combined approach, individual experience of the physician determines the treatment. An overview of these different modalities and their evidence is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Topical treatment Topical treatments consist predominantly of keratolytic agents or anti-bacterial agents. Resorcinol 15% cream can be used both as acute treatment and as preventative treatment. Its keratolytic features help to prevent occlusion of the hair follicle via its mild peeling effect. Topical clindamycin 1%, a bacteriostatic lotion, was superior to placebo after 3 months, in particular on superficial lesions, e.g. folliculitis and pustules.102 Systemic treatment Antibiotics Antibiotics are the first-line of treatment for HS, based on clinical experience, as they have both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, are cheap and side-effects are usually limited to gastro-intestinal discomfort. Tetracyclines are the first option, followed by the combination therapy of clindamycin and rifampicin.102 The latter significantly improved HS symptoms and the quality of life of patients after ten weeks of treatment.103,104 Triple therapy with rifampicin, moxifloxacin and metronidazole resulted in complete remission in 16 out of 28 patients in a case series.61,105 Retinoids Retinoids, such as isotretinoin and properties. Isotretinoin may prevent occlusion of the hair follicle and can be considered for patients with concomitant severe acne vulgaris.106 However, the European and Dutch HS guidelines do not recommend it for treatment of HS alone.61,107 In addition to common side effects and teratogenic properties, results of treatment of HS with isotretinoin are often disappointing, both in literature and in clinical practice.108,109 Acitretin reduces the proliferation rate of keratinocytes, which results in thinning of the cornified layer of the skin. Significant improvement of symptoms is reported in limited number of patients, however randomized controlled trials have not been performed.61 Biologics For patients with moderate to severe HS, who failed on antibiotic therapy, treatment with 25biologics is the next step. Adalimumab (Humira), a monoclonal TNF- inhibitor, is the only currently registered treatment of HS. The PIONEER I and II studies reported clinical response rates (a fifty percent reduction in abscess and nodule (AN) count from baseline), at week 12 of 42% (PIONEER I; n=307) and 59% in (PIONEER II; n=326) with weekly subcutaneous administration of 40 mg adalimumab.41 This response was maintained in 52% of patients through week 168 with weekly dosing and no new safety concerns were raised.110 However, in this open label study only 88 out of 533 patients were included and missing data of patients discontinuing the study were handled with a last observation carried forward approach (LOCF). This could have positively biased the response rate of 52%. One randomized controlled trial with infliximab was performed (n=38) with a fifty percent reduction in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Index (HSSI) as primary endpoint. The HSSI assesses different signs and symptoms, e.g. number of sites, body surface area and pain (VAS), resulting in a composite score from 0 to 19. At week 8, approximately 25% of patients receiving infliximab reached the primary endpoint, compared to 5% in the placebo group (p=0.092).111 In an open-label study, ustekinumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which binds to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, achieved HiSCR in 47% of patients.112 However, like infliximab, it has not been registered for treatment of HS and can only be prescribed in academic centers. Treatment with anakinra, an IL-1R antagonist, decreased disease severity scores significantly among 15 patients.113,114 Canakinumab, an IL-1 antagonist, showed varied results in case reports and series.43 Future clinical trials should determine, whether anakinra and canakinumab are valuable treatment options for HS. Surgery Surgical interventions remain imperative in HS disease management and should be considered for each disease stage.61,107 Via excising the affected skin, local disease control can be achieved. Several methods have been described with varying recurrence rates.115 The type of surgical intervention should be determined based on the location of lesions, type of lesions and extensiveness of disease in a particular area. And naturally, the experience of the physician performing the surgery. Limited excisions and or deroofing can be used for small recurring lesions and/or superficial sinus tracts. Skin-tissue-sparing excision with electrosurgical peeling (STEEP) is a procedure with low recurrence rates and high patient satisfaction.116 The benefit over wide excision is that it aims for both radicality and sparing healthy tissue and can easily be performed using local anaesthesia, especially with local tumescent anaesthesia. Wide excision is predominantly indicated for patients with Hurley stage III disease, and it often requires general anaesthesia. After surgical intervention, secondary intention wound healing is preferred over primary closure, to prevent recurrence in the excised area. However, evidence other than expert opinion is currently lacking for this approach. Acute flares and pain management The acute onset of painful nodules or abscesses, a disease flare, is characteristic for HS. These acute lesions, which can develop within several hours, can be immensely painful and highly debilitating, which makes adequate management a vital part of HS treatment. Patients can apply topical resorcinol 15% cream up to three times a day.117,118 Its keratolytic effect can accelerate Introduction 1Table 2.

Inflammatory nodules can also be treated with intralesional triamcinolone injections, which inhibits formation of pro- inflammatory cytokines.119 For abscesses, immediate pain relieve can be achieved via incision and drainage.120 This procedure should merely be used for an acute flare/for instant pain alleviation, as the recurrence rate is almost 100%.121 Pain management is essential in the HS treatment strategy, as pain is the predominant symptom of HS. The steps for pain medication are documented in the pain ladder of the World Health Organisation. Oral acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first step, followed by oral opiates, in case of post-surgical pain management. Opioids are not recommended for the chronic HS-related pain, because of its chronicity brings along a high risk of opioid addiction. Other types of pain medication, such cannabis oil, anticonvulsants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can also provide pain relief, especially in case of neuropathic pains.122 Other therapies Systemic treatment Other, less common, systemic anti-inflammatory treatments for HS include prednisolone, apremilast, dapsone, methotrexate and cyclosporine. Prednisolone is not recommended for long-term use, but short-term therapy with rapid tapering can reduce pain and inflammation associated with flares.61 Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, showed significant Table 3.

Metformin is suggested as a treatment option for HS, as metabolic syndrome is more common among patients with HS, of which insulin resistance is a characteristic.77 In addition to improving insulin resistance, metformin exhibits a potentially anti-inflammatory effect, via decreasing levels of IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-. A decrease in disease severity was shown in prospective and retrospective case series.124,125 Zinc exhibits anti-inflammatory features and significantly improved quality of life and reduced the number of lesions combined with topical anti-bacterial and anti-fungal lotion.126 Non-pharmacological options Hair removal by laser via intense pulsed light or with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser have been mentioned in literature. Destruction of the hair follicle, as this is currently seen as the origin of the disease, via the Nd:YAG laser might be beneficial, especially in early stages of the disease. Notably, ablation of the apocrine glands via microwave ablation (MiraDry) is not recommended, as the only trial was discontinued because of aggravation of HS symptoms.127 It was argued that the microwave energy caused rupture of sub-clinical cysts, resulting in flare of the disease. Lifestyle and coaching Lifestyle interventions in HS Additional to any medical and/or surgical treatment, lifestyle interventions are often necessary. Evidence exists for improvement of the disease following smoking cessation and weight reduction, as discussed earlier.56,60 However, implementing these lifestyle changes is extra challenging for patients with HS. Exercise can be painful when a patient has active lesions. Additionally, the increased mechanical stress on the skin caused by exercising can induce the formation of new lesions. Cessation of smoking can cause weight gain, which makes patients even more hesitant to quit. Furthermore, patients with HS generally have a lower socioeconomic status, compared to other dermatologic patients, so the costs of lifestyle interventions are often an issue.128 An encouraging and supportive development for patients is the coverage of combined lifestyle intervention programmes by health insurances in The Netherlands. Hence, this support via health insurers is an important step in encouraging HS patients to improve their lifestyle. Coaching and education As HS is a chronic disease, coaching of the patients should be a part of the integral treatment approach. Informing patients about all aspects of the disease can aid them in coping with the disease. Furthermore, creating more awareness for HS among physicians, will further support HS patients, because they will feel better understood. By educating physicians, in particular general practitioners, might be the way to go, to reduce the average diagnostic delay of 7 Introduction 130years.129 Early diagnosis and treatment will minimize the burden for patients and for the health care system. OUTLINE AND AIMS OF THIS THESIS Despite encouraging progress in the past decades, HS treatment strategies are only partially effective, and many aspects of HS still need further research. To ultimately improve the HS patient's quality of life, more insight into the prevalence, treatment and the extent of burden of this disease is essential. Therefore, this thesis is not confined to a single aspect of HS, but addresses a selection of interrelated topics on novel treatment and quality of life. The prevalence of HS varies greatly in the literature, depending on the type of method used and the country where the study was performed. In Chapter 2 the prevalence of HS in 136.000 adult participants of the Lifelines population-based cohort in the northern Netherlands is assessed via two validated questions for HS self-diagnosis. The original Hurley classification is insufficient for adequately staging HS and therefore the refined Hurley classification was developed. In Chapter 3 , the reliability and face validity of the refined Hurley classification are evaluated. HS is considered an auto-inflammatory disease, a mitigating effect of pregnancy on the disease activity is hypothesized. Chapter 4 assesses the disease course during pregnancy and also in the postpartum phase. Since HS affects the working adult population, its impact on personal and professional daily life is enormous. The aim of Chapter 5 was to assess work productivity among HS patients and therefore, to identify differences between working and non-working HS patients. Furthermore, factors possibly influencing the work productivity were investigated. The current treatment modalities for HS are insufficient. Surgery remains a key component in treatment strategies for HS, but the benefit for patients is unclear thus far. To that end, Chapter 6 provides insight into the impact of major surgery on the quality of life of HS patients. Additionally, activity impairment and sexual health were assessed in a prospective setting. In Chapter 7 , the drug survival, defined as 'the time from initiation of biologic therapy to discontinuation', of adalimumab and infliximab is evaluated for HS treatment in a daily practice setting. Complement activation is hypothesized to be a crucial pathway in HS pathogenesis and the C5a blocker IFX-1, a monoclonal antibody, is being tested in clinical trials. Hence, the aim of Chapter 8 was to investigate the levels of complement factors C3, C3d, sC5b-9 and C5a in the plasma of HS patients. The general discussion in Chapter 9 integrates the findings from the eight research studies within the context of the current clinical and mechanistic understanding of HS. Furthermore, future perspectives for HS research are addressed in the context of innovative immunotherapy and novel technologies.31REFERENCES 1.
