They are found in many petroleum products and also play a key role in the biological activities of a number of pharmaceutical agents. Synthesis of these tetrahydrothiopyran moieties have always been an exciting challenge for the synthetic organic chemists. Hence an efficient, metal free, methodology for the diasterio selective synthesis of tetrahydrothiopyrans using Prins trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf ) in good yields under mild reaction conditions has being developed. The reaction with TMSOTf in Toulene/CH2Cl2 (1:1) solvent system produced 2,4,6-trisubstituted tetrahydrothiopyrans in 75% yield with dr 88:12. The structure of the compounds were confirmed by 1H, 13C NMR, IR and mass spectrometry. The diastereomeric ratio was determined from the 1H NMR of crude reaction mixture. The reaction was also screened with various Lewis and Brnsted acids with an aim to synthesize tetrahydrothiopyran ring system.

He is currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry, Assam Don Bosco University. Institute of Chemistry of New Materials of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Belarus Magnetic nanoparticles (NP) of iron oxides and their composites with hydroxyapatite (HA) are used for the targeted delivery of biologically active compounds (BAS) and drugs and have a significant advantage over traditional methods of therapy, since the active substances immobilized on the nanocarrier are protected from chemical, enzymatic and immune degradation on the way to the target of therapy. A simple one-step method for the synthesis of magnetic nanocarriers of bioactive compounds (BA)-new amides and benzohydrazides of the 2-arylaminopyrimidine series, containing fragments of the structure of known antitumor drugs, as well as functional NH2 groups providing chemosorption of BA nanoparticles, was developed. A distinctive feature of the preparation of composites is the presence of 2-arylaminopyrimidine derivatives in the nanocarrier forming medium, including nanosized hydroxyapatite and magnetite - ((HAP)FexOy)PAD (PAD in the covalent immobilization method. The composition, morphology and magnetic characteristics of synthesized nanocomposites were studied. Composites ((HAP) FexOy)BAS with an adsorbed biologically active substance based on 2-arylaminopyrimidinamide derivatives are bioactive nanosystems ready for in vivo applications, for example, for the treatment of bone diseases. To check the effectiveness of a such system using, the kinetics of the BAC release was studied in the work, on the basis of which it was shown that the biologically active compound is released in two stages within 5 hours: 80% of the active substance is released in the first 2 hours and then the remainder is released in the next 3 hours substances.

Institute of Chemistry of New Materials of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Belarus Nanoparticles (NP) of various nature change the properties of polymeric materials: optical, heat and electrophysical. Polyaniline (PANI) is an electrically conductive polymer, has properties typical for semiconductors, is characterized by high thermal and chemical stability, which allows one to obtain materials with strictly specified properties and therefore, to expand the scope of their application in various optoelectronic devices. The influence of PANI, PANI composites with Fe2O3, CeO2, Ag, as well as Ag/CeO2 and CeO2/Ag NPs on the thermal and electrical conductivity of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films stained with Chicago Sky Blue 6B (CSB) dichroic commercial dye was studied. The anisotropy of the thermal conductivity of colored film samples containing PANI composites with Fe2O3, CeO2, Ag and the Ag/CeO2 and CeO2/Ag composites increases in comparison with the CSB-colored film in 1.1 - 2.2 times and the anisotropy of the electrical conductivity of the films with composites increases significantly (30 - 80 times) compared to the stained sample. Colored films containing PANI composites with Fe2O3, Ag and CeO2/Ag composite are characterized by a high polarizing ability (PS) of 90 - 99% in the expanded spectral compared to Chicago Sky Blue 6B (594 - 690 nm, PS = 90-97%) in the range 561 - 698 nm and films with the addition of the PANI/Fe2O3 composite are resistant to UV light (the rate of decolorization of a colored sample with a composite is reduced by 45.4%). The thermal and electrical conductivity of colored films can be improved by introducing PANI composites with Fe2O3, CeO2, Ag as well as Ag/CeO2 and CeO2/Ag which is important when film materials are used in devices operated under the influence of heat and electricity.

Recent achievements in this area are associated with the design of small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, organic compounds exhibiting directed pathogenetic action. 2-Arylaminopyrimidine derivatives are the most commonly used templates for the development of these molecules. In this study, the methodology of the design of chimeric molecules and directed organic synthesis of potential anti-cancer compounds with multikinase profile were developed based on the derivatives of 2-arylaminopyrimidine and substituted aryl carboxylic acids isothiazole followed by in silico evaluation of inhibitory activity against native and mutant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. In doing so, the following studies were performed: i) computer-aided design of potential kinase inhibitor candidates consistent with the above methodology; ii) molecular docking of these compounds with the enzyme active site; iii) refinement of the ligand-binding poses by the PM7 semi-empirical quantum chemical method; iv) prediction of the interaction modes dominating the binding; v) calculation of the values of binding free energy and dissociation constant for the PM7-based ligand/Bcr-Abl complexes; and vi) selection of molecules most promising for synthesis and biochemical assays. As a result, top ranked compounds that specifically and effectively interact with the active sites of the native and mutant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and show the low values of binding free energy and dissociation constants were identified and synthesized. Based on the data obtained, these compounds are suggested to present good scaffolds for the development of novel potent anti-tumor drugs.

Field of scientific interests: chemistry of heterocyclic compounds, fine organic synthesis, bioorganic chemistry. Institute of Chemistry of New Materials of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Belarus Electrically conductive polymers, which include polyaniline (PANI), represent a new class of synthetic materials that combine the chemical and mechanical properties of polymers with the conductive properties of metals and semiconductors. Since the 60yrs of the XX century, conductive polymers have become the object of close attention of researchers due to the possession of special properties caused with the presence in their structure of a conjugated bond system. Polyaniline and its composites with metal nanoparticles are increasingly used in such areas as medicine, electronic and optical devices, biosensors. We have developed an effective method for matrix polymerization of aniline using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) of various molecular weights, carboxymethyl cellulose and dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid as steric stabilizers. Methods for the synthesis of polyaniline with NPs of silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron oxides, cerium dioxide, composites PANI/Ag/CeO2, PANI/Fe3O4/CeO2, Ag/CeO2 and CeO2/Ag using the methods of ultrasonic and hydrothermal synthesis are proposed. The dimensional parameters of composites, using the methods of dynamic light scattering, optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, are determined. The sizes of agglomerates of nanoparticles ranged from 10 to 100 nm and the sizes of their PANI composites ranged from 1 to 28 m, depending on their nature. Composites were used for the subsequent production of polyvinyl alcohol films on their basis and the study of their physicochemical characteristics.

Research Interests: Methods for producing of iron oxides, silver, cerium dioxide nanoparticles and their composites with bioactive compounds of the 2-arylaminopyrimidine series, production of polyaniline and its composites with metal nanoparticles. Institute of Chemistry of New Materials of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Belarus Obtaining new compounds with pharmacological properties is possible by creating structures, which may include fragments of various biologically active compounds connected by such bonds as amide, sulfonamide or ester, which are easily broken down in the body by enzymes. Thus, these molecules can either exert an independent pharmacological effect after delivering them to the corresponding organs in the human body or enhance the effect of each other showing synergism. The heterocyclic 2-aminopyrimidine system is one of important pharmacophores responsible for the biological properties of its derivatives. Derivatives were obtained on the basis of 2-aminopyrimidine, a wide spectrum of antitumor activity of which makes them an attractive object of organic synthesis and arouses interest in rationalizing the methods for their preparation. Amides and sulfonamides of oxydibenzoic acid exhibit various types of biological activity and used to treat malaria, leprosy, infections caused by mycobacteria, cognitive impairment, Alzheimers disease, treat cancer, etc. We propose the methodology for the synthesis of sulfonamides based on derivatives of 2-arylaminopyrimidine and oxydibenzoic acid. This methodology includes the design of amide molecules using pharmacophore modeling, effective methods for the synthesis of key precursors and target compounds. New sulfonamides of 4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-3-sulfobenzoic acid containing fragments of heterocyclic amines (pyridine and pyrimidine) with preparative yields of 75-87% were synthesized. Experimental samples of the new sulfonamides of oxydibenzoic acid were synthesized for subsequent biological tests for antitumor activity on cell lines.

Literature survey revealed that azines were found to possess antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Although symmetrical azines are readily synthesized by the reaction of hydrazine with an excess of an aldehydes herein we report the preparation and the characterizations of two novel symmetrical azines and explore their biological activities for the first time. 1 H NMR, 13CNMR, UV-Vis, FT-IR Spectroscopy and DRX were used to characterize these azines structures. In addition, recent investigations described potential benefits of Schiff bases inreductive antioxidant capacity activities. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and evaluation inhibitory of these two new azines Schiff bases were measured and were compared to those of standard drugs.

Its structure closely resembles that of the layered structure of graphite, so it is called a graphitic carbon nitride and is denoted as g-C3N4. Due to the high nitrogen content, carbon nitride has high chemical and thermal resistance. Thanks to this, it is used as a support in catalysis. It is for this purpose that we used carbon nitride in our research. Carbon nitride was doped by nickel and then was reduced at 525\u00b0C. Surprisingly, it was noted that the reduction at high temperature leads to a increase in the specific surface area of the catalyst, up to 380 m2g-1. Moreover, during the reduction process, significant amounts of gases (like NH3, CH4, HCN) are released. It indicates that the evolution of gases causes more porosity of the structure. One of the problems of the 21st century is the growing pollution of the environment. One of them is the pollution of waters with organic compounds that can be removed in sorption processes. This is where the obtained material was used. However, for better results, the metal was washed out of the system. The developed specific surface of carbon nitride was used in sorption processes of organic dyes, like rhodamine B and methyl orange. For example, the maximum sorption od RhB is close to 200 mg g-1. Biography: Emilia Alwin is a PhD student in fourth year at the Faculty of Chemistry at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. Emilia Alwin research focuses on heterogeneous catalysis using a carbon nitride as a support, which is doped with various noble and non-noble metals. The main research aspects relate to the use of these catalysts in the production of hydrogen, photocatalysis and sorption of organic dyes. The aim of the research is to further expand the possibilities of using modified carbon nitride structures. Adam Mickiewicz University, Poland The properties of silica, such as: low price, thermal stability, hardness, chemical resistance and nontoxicity make it one of the most frequently applied catalyst support. It has been shown that the activity of palladium catalysts for benzene, toluene and xylene hydrogenation is consistently higher with acidic supports than those with neutral silica [1,2]. For this reason modification of silica in order to generate the acidic properties seems to be especially interesting. In this work, commercial silica (SiO2) was modified using aqueous solution of ammonium fluoride (SiO2-F) and ammonium chloride (SiO2-Cl). The resulting materials were used as supports for iridium active phase. The catalysts containing 1 wt.% of iridium supported on silica were prepared by conventional impregnation method using hexachloroiridic acid as metal precursor. The prepared catalysts and supports were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements and H2-TPR. The mean size of metal particles was determined by hydrogen chemisorption measurements. The acidity of modified SiO2 was estimated by means of temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). The effect of acidity of supports on the activity of iridium catalysts for toluene hydrogenation was studied. The catalyst supported on silica modified using ammonium fluoride is the most active. Biography: Monika Kot is a PhD student in chemistry at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna (Poland). Her research topics focus on heterogeneous catalysis. She works on synthesis and characterization of iridium and nickel catalysts supported on silica supports with different acidity and structural properties for hydrogenation reactions. Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Spain Biomass represents a major renewable carbon resource that can be used to produce fuels and bulk chemicals though manufacturing processes. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the most promising biomass-based chemicals that has the potential to be converted to a variety of useful intermediates for polymers and many other fine chemicals. In this communication, we report the effective oxidation of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) catalysed by two manganese(III)-Schiff base complexes in a pH 8.5, phosphate buffer at room temperature. DFF is a versatile precursor in the synthesis of functional polymers, pharmaceuticals, anti fungal agents and furan-urea resins. Oxidations of HMF to DFF were performed under mild conditions using an Iso-tech laboratory DC power supply. Sodium chloride acts as electrolyte in order to increase the conductivity of water and to reduce the power dissipation. The electro catalytic reaction proceeds through the oxidation of chloride into hypochlorite at alkaline pH in a chlorine-free medium. Four manganese(III)-Schiff base complexes were tested, two of them behave as efficient catalysts in the oxidation of DFF to HMF with conversion rates of 70-80 %. The two active catalysts have a short carbon chain between imine groups, a feature that leads to tetragonally elongated octahedral geometries. An axial water molecule in this class of distorted geometries is quite a labile ligand the loss of which would generate a vacant position in the coordination sphere to accommodate the substrate molecule. On the other hand the two manganese(III)-Schiff base with flexible chain between the imine groups gave only 11% conversion to DFF.

Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Spain Helicity can be found in a wide variety of natural and artificial structures. Helicoidal structures are considered to be promising architectures given their wide variety of properties. Thus, these chiral compounds have been exhaustively studied because of their involvement in different areas such as anion sensor, luminescence, magnetism, chirality, molecular machines, guest recognition and DNA binding. To prepare this type of metallo supramolecular structures, the ligands must be coordinated by wrapping around the metal ions. Particularly, helicates derived from Schiff bases are interesting due to the versatility and similarity of these ligands with other present in life. In this work, a novel neutral cobalt dinuclear helicate [Co2(L)2] 2CH3CN has been obtained by an electrochemical method (Figure 1). To achieve this, a dianionic and tetradentate ONNO Schiff base ligand H2L has been designed. This ligand possess two binding domains [NO] separated by a semi-flexible aromatic spacer. This helical complex has been fully characterized both in solution and solid state. The crystal structure consists of discrete dinuclear helical molecules, constructed from two bi deprotonated ligand units arranged around two Co2+ atoms.
