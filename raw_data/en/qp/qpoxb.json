Estes October 3, 2020 (received for review January 15, 2020) Canine distemper virus (CDV) has recently emerged as an extinc- tion threat for the endangered Amur tiger ( Panthera tigris altaica ). CDV is vaccine-preventable, and control strategies could requirevaccination of domestic dogs and/or wildlife populations. How-ever, vaccination of endangered wildlife remains controversial, which has led to a focus on interventions in domestic dogs, often assumed to be the source of infection. Effective decision makingrequires an understanding of the true reservoir dynamics, whichposes substantial challenges in remote areas with diverse host communities. We carried out serological, demographic, and phylo- genetic studies of dog and wildlife populations in the Russian FarEast to show that a number of wildlife species are more importantthan dogs, both in maintaining CDV and as sources of infection for tigers. Critically, therefore, because CDV circulates among multiple wildlife sources, dog vaccination alone would not be effective atprotecting tigers. We show, however, that low-coverage vaccina- tion of tigers themselves is feasible and would produce substan- tive reductions in extinction risks. Vaccination of endangeredwildlife provides a valuable component of conservation strategiesfor endangered species. Amur tiger |Panthera tigris altaica |canine distemper | wildlife vaccination |extinction Tigers ( ), among the world 's most iconic carni- vore species, are highly threatened. Having once occupied vast swathes of Asia from Turkey to the Sea of Japan, fewer than 3,500 tigers now survive with breeding populations in just eightcountries, all of which are fragmented and acutely vulnerable toextinction (1). The Amur tiger subspecies ( P. tigris altaica ) numbers fewer than 550 individuals in two discrete populations in the Russian Far East and neighboring areas of China. Results and Discussion Infectious diseases are increasingly recognized as an extinction threat for endangered carnivores, and viral pathogens, particu-larly those linked with domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris), have been the cause of major declines in several populations (2). One of these pathogens, canine distemper virus (CDV) ( Canine morbillivirus ), is commonly associated with domestic dogs but has also caused disease outbreaks in Serengeti lions ( Panthera leo ), Ethiopian wolves Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis )( 3-5), and is now also emerging as a threat toAmur tigers. CDV was first detected as the cause of death in Amur tigers in 2003, with subsequent cases confirmed in 2010(6, 7); population viability analyses showed that CDV increased the 50-y extinction probability of small populations to over 50%, an increase of up to 65% (8). These findings have highlighted theneed for active management of disease in the conservation of the Amur tiger and possibly other more fragmented tiger pop- ulations across the species 'range. Several approaches to disease management might be consid- ered, but effective decision making requires both an understanding Significance The decline and progressive fragmentation of many threat- ened populations increase extinction vulnerability due to out-breaks of infectious disease. Vaccination is one of the few toolsavailable to mitigate these threats, but its use is often ham- pered by insufficient epidemiological understanding and his- toric controversies over endangered wildlife vaccination. Usingthe example of Amur tigers and CDV, we describe a holistic approach to select appropriate disease mitigation strategies based on key epidemiological evidence from the field. We thenassess the protection of vaccinated tigers against the locallycirculating CDV strain and use modeling to compare the effi- cacy and cost of potential vaccination programs. This practical approach provides conservation managers with an evidence-based rationale to address disease-mediated extinction risksfor threatened wildlife E.C.T., B.J.W., S.A.O., L.M., and S.C. wrote the paper.

For CDV inthe Russian Far East, investigation of reservoirs and implementa- tion of interventions both pose a substantial challenge. CDV can infect many host species, with the Amur tiger habitat supportinghighly diverse carnivore communities (17 wild carnivore speciesalong with domestic dogs) and these areas span large, remote tracts of land. Disease interventions could be designed to reduce transmis- sion to tigers through blocking tactics (e.g., limiting contact be- tween tigers and potential source populations such as domesticdogs or other wild carnivores), or by reducing CDV infectionprevalence in reservoir or source populations (e.g., throughvaccination). Alternatively, vaccination could be directed to the target population of primary concern, in this case tigers. How- ever, vaccination of endangered wildlife populations has in thepast been beset by controversy (10 -12), and this has led con- servation managers to focus primarily on vaccination of domestic dogs\u2014established as important sources of infection in other ecosystems (13, 14). Indeed, conservationists and the general public often assume domestic dogs must be the source of CDVinfection for endangered wildlife (15, 16). Our first objective was to generate and evaluate epidemio- logical evidence to determine the likely relative importance of domestic dogs and wild carnivore hosts as sources of CDV in- fection for Amur tigers in the Primorskii Krai region of Russia.The challenges of sample collection typical of work in such re-mote regions required us to draw on multiple sources of evidenceto unravel reservoir relationships. These include CDV serologi- cal data, which provides a reliable indicator of prior infection but has limited power to discern precise temporal patterns, and virussequence data, which has the potential to generate powerfulinsights but is hampered by the short duration of CDV infectivity that limits opportunities for virus detection or isolation. The first confirmed case of CDV infection was in 2003, and a retrospective analysis of serological data in Amur tigers supports the contention that CDV was recently introduced into thispopulation. CDV antibodies were not detected in any of 18 tigerssampled prior to 2000 but were detected in 20 of 54 tigers (37.0%) sampled since then (Table 1). Serological and demographic data also provide insight on the role of domestic dogs and other wildlife. CDV antibodies were detected in unvaccinated dogs from 24 of 37 settlements sampledand in eight wild carnivore species from eight locations acrossPrimorskii Krai, confirming that CDV exposure S2 and Table S1 ). Contrary to expectations, we detected a higher CDV seroprevalence and higher frequency ofCDV outbreaks among dogs in small remote populations than inmore densely populated areas (Table 2 and SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). Of the 32 dogs in the most remote survey community, all had been born there, and none had traveled to other settlements; never- theless we detected antibodies in four of the five unvaccinateddogs sampled, including a 12-mo-old pup. This population is fartoo small to maintain the pathogen (17), so the most plausibleexplanation for recently infected individuals is that wildlife con- stitutes an important source of CDV infection for dogs, chal- lenging a widely held view that the epidemiological cycle isdominated by dog-to-wildlife transmission. Patterns of dog movement and population connectivity raise further questions about the role of domestic dogs as a potential maintenance population. The estimated size of the dog populationacross Primorskii Krai as a whole (467,244 CI: 442,549 to 496,933dogs) may be large enough to exceed the critical community size needed to maintain a morbillivirus infection (compared to an es- timated combined population of the of the four most abundantwild carnivore species of between 196,850 and 585,900 animals; SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 2 ). However, the relationship between host population size and CDV persistence is likely to be modified by the limited connectivity between subpopulations. Survey data in-dicated that only 6.1% of dogs were permitted complete freedomof movement, and only 6.9% were ever taken to other settlements,providing few opportunities for CDV transmission (17). Analysis of genetic sequence data provides further support for wildlife acting as a reservoir ( SI Appendix , Tables S3 and S4 ). For tigers, sequence data were obtained from a combination of live and postmortem sampling events conducted between 2000 and 2014 [n =23 tigers, including three known CDV cases from 2003 and 2010 (7)]. We obtained sequence data corresponding to thehemagglutinin attachment glycoprotein (H-gene, 1,824 bp) from two previously unidentified cases involving tigers which died in 2006 (GenBank accession no. KX708720) and in 2013 (KX708726). Wealso genome paraffin-embedded brain specimen from the 2003case (KX774415). From other wild life, full H-genes were sequenced from 22 wild carnivores, with viruses detected in each of the 4 ysampled (2012 to 2015; SI Appendix ,T a b l e sS 3a n dS 4 ), and a further sequence from a critically endangered Far Eastern leopard(Panthera pardus orientalis ) in 2015 (MK169401). Despite extensive sampling, only one partial H-gene sequence was obtained from a domestic dog. This sample was collected during a CDV outbreak in Vladivostok in 2016 (539 bp, MK169402). Phylogenetic trees generated using these sequences showed that tiger, leopard, and other wildlife viruses clustered together with published sequences from the Arctic-like clade (19), whereasthe dog virus was genetically distinct, aligning within the Asia-4clade alongside sequences from Thailand and China (20) (Fig. 1). Additional sequences encoding fusion glycoproteins (F-genes, 1,954 bp) from 13 of these animals added topological support tothe trees generated. The genetic data show that closely relatedviruses are infecting a wide range of wild carnivore hosts across awide geographic area over a prolonged time period, but there is no evidence of a relationship to viruses circulating in domestic dogs across the broader region. Indeed, the results from the single dogsuggest that a distinct epidemiological cycle is occurring there. Table 1.

The key point is that, even without a full understanding of CDV in dogs, we now have sufficient evi- dence to suggest that interventions that focus only on domesticdogs would not be effective at preventing infection of tigers be- cause of the role of wildlife. Indeed, together with the serological data, these results are consistent with an interpretation that wildlife are likely to be key hosts contributing to CDV maintenance across the Russian FarTable 2.

PNAS Latest Articles |3o f9 ECOLOGYDownloaded by guest on November 23, 2020 East and an important source of CDV infection for tigers in this area. There are several potential routes of CDV transmission from wild carnivores to tigers. The recent detection of CDV in a raccoon dog killed by a tiger in southern Primorskii suggests thatpredation is one such plausible route. Susceptible species (in-cluding Siberian weasels, sable, raccoon dogs, and wild boar) are occasionally observed attending tiger kills, providing a possible opportunity for indirect transmission. Exposure of free-rangingwild boars in Japan and limited CDV replication in lymphoidcells of experimentally infected pigs introduce the potential of transmission from noncarnivore prey (21, 22). Armed with this evidence, our second objective was to inves- tigate the feasibility of interventions targeted at wildlife. The lackof an oral delivery system for a CDV vaccine renders the pros- pects of controlling infection in a wild reservoir in this ecosystemlogistically untenable. In these circumstances, the only practicalmeans of reducing the extinction threat would be to consider individually vaccinating sufficient numbers of tigers to ensure populations can withstand future outbreaks. As an essential first step to evaluating the feasibility of this approach, we confirmed that vaccinated tigers could neutralize the CDV strain circulating in tiger habitat. Conventional modi- fied live vaccines have been found to be safe for administrationto captive tigers, and elicit a measurable humoral immune re-sponse (23). However, the use of these products in field situations requires assurance of their capacity to induce responses that neu- tralize the wild CDV strain infecting tigers. Vaccine-induced an-tibodies must bind to the external H and F glycoproteins of the wild viral strain to protect otherwise-susceptible tigers. By using a neutralization assay based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)pseudotypes (24) bearing the external glycoproteins of the Russianviral strain (KX708722), we showed that serum from tigers vacci- nated with a modified live vaccine (Nobivac DP; Merck) could neutralize the local strain, providing a credible means of protectingindividual tigers from disease ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ). Contemporary CDV vaccines must be delivered by injection, which places a practical constraint on the rate of vaccine ad-ministration for a species as rare and cryptic as the Amur tiger.This would require time-consuming capture operations or, the-oretically, delivery through a remote darting system (25), with administration limited to a very small number of tigers each year. However, low-coverage vaccination approaches have been shownto be effective during outbreaks of rabies in controlling spread andpreventing the extinction of Ethiopian wolf packs (26). Our pre- vious individual-based stochastic susceptible -infected -recovered/ dead (SIRD) model with demography demonstrated the high probability of extinction of Amur tigers over the next 50 y in small isolated populations in the absence of CDV control strategies (8). We adapted this population viability analysis to assess the effec-tiveness of achievable low coverage vaccination strategies to re-duce the 50-y extinction probability of the population of Amur tigers in the vicinity of the Land of the Leopard National Park (LLNP) (Fig. 2), using a demographic susceptible -vaccinated - infected -recovered/dead (SVIRD) model. Although the LLNP population is small and genetically isolated, it is of high conser- vation value as a source for recolonizing formerly occupied habitat in northeast China (27). The SVIRD model predicted that whilereactive strategies (triggered by the detection of affected tigers)had little effect on extinction probability, a proactive approach (vaccinating small numbers of tigers each year without spatial selection) could substantially reduce the risk of extinction. Usingrealistic model parameters based on the findings of the current study and from the literature, annual vaccination of two tigers per year reduced the 50-y extinction probability of the LLNPpopulation from 15.8 to 5.7% at a mean annual cost of less than$30,000 (Table 3). A culture of risk aversion has led to a reluctance among wildlife authorities to consider wildlife vaccination as a means ofpreventing the extinction of endangered populations. Specifi-cally, a now discredited hypothesis that attributed the extinction of African wild dogs ( Lycaon pictus ) in the Serengeti to a rabies vaccination intervention (11) has had far-reaching influence on conservation policy, with wildlife vaccination often rejected as apotential conservation tool (10). Instead, wildlife managers have chosen to rely on vaccination of domestic reservoirs as the pre- ferred strategy to control pathogen spillover into endangeredspecies. Our findings counter the assumption that domestic dogsmust be acting as CDV reservoirs for Amur tigers and should dispel the perception that domestic dogs are the principal source of infection of CDV. Future policy must be based on a rationalinterpretation of epidemiological evidence augmented by ex situ assessments of vaccine safety and efficacy, and the use of mod- eling in the design of feasible delivery strategies for a givencontext. Materials and Methods Dog Demography Surveys. Extreme winter temperatures in Primorskii Krai, which regularly dip below 15 \u00b0C, limit opportunities for dogs to subsist without human care, and as a result feral dogs are limited or absent, par- ticularly outside urban centers. For this reason, this study concentrated onowned dogs, as these constitute the vast majority of dogs within the terri-tory. Surveys focused on rural settlements within 25-km buffers surrounding the boundaries of the N45.7\u00b0,E136.8\u00b0). areas contained 84 settlements according to the 2010 pop-ulation census (28). A random selection of 26 rural settlements was gener-ated for demography surveys (including 16/64 around LLNP, 7/16 aroundLazovskii, and 3/4 around SABZ). Settlements were classified based on the number of residents present in 2010 as villages ( 1,000 people), towns (>1,000 people, 10,000), large towns ( >10,000 people, 100,000), or cities (>100,000 people). Target household sample sizes were selected using the \"pwr\"package in R (29). A minimum sample size of 389 households per study area was chosen using a two-tailed test to detect differences in proportional responses toquestions of 10%, with an expected response of 50% (which maximizesrequired sample size), at a power of 80% and a 95% significance level. A questionnaire was developed based on published guidelines (30) to collect information on dog ownership patterns and demography. Ques- tionnaires were designed and optimized during pilot surveys in July 2012 and November 2012. Interviews were conducted in Russian during visits to all 26 settlements in November 2012, June 2013, and October 2014. Inter-viewers visited all residences in villages, explained project objectives tohouseholders, and requested their compliance in completing the surveysirrespective of whether they owned dogs. In towns and large towns, it wasimpractical to survey all residences. In these settlements, a subset of resi-dences was randomly generated using published methods (31). Interviews consisted of a list of questions that were completed in a semistructured manner designed to obtain data at the level of the household, and on individual dogs currently living in the residence. Household data included the number of human residents, the number of dogs currentlyowned, and the number of dogs owned 10 y previously. Dog-related ques-tions included vaccination history, frequency of movement beyond the set-tlement (never, rarely, at least annually, at least monthly, at least weekly),and freedom to roam unsupervised beyond the property boundaries (never, rarely/sometimes, part of the day, or all day). A total of 2,576 rural questionnaires were completed across the 26 study settlements, with a mean coverage per settlement of 62.8% (SD: 54.2%). Thestudy areas contained no cities; therefore, a simplified urban questionnaire was used in the city of Ussuriysk (situated less than 20 km from LLNP) to collectdata describing dog ownership in urban areas. A total of 1,461 urbanquestionnaires were completed, focusing on residents interviewed alongmajor thoroughfares, transport hubs, and outside popular groceries. Inter-viewees were asked to provide their settlement of residence, and the number of people and dogs within their household. Human population growth was estimated for each study settlement using the census figures from 2002 and 2010. These growth estimates were used toextrapolate the 2010 census figures in order to obtain estimated population sizes at the start of the study on November 6, 2012. Ratios of humans to dogsin surveyed households were used to estimate total numbers of dogs in eachsettlement, and also used as the basis for extrapolating numbers of dogs 4o f9 |www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2000153117 Gilbert et al.Downloaded by guest on November 23, 2020 across the territory of Primorskii Krai at the start of the study in 2012. For this purpose, the distribution of human-to-dog ratios for settlements of each size category was obtained by resampling the data using a subsample of 100 households in each settlement size category, through 1,000 bootstrap rep- licates. These were fitted to a gamma distribution, which was then used to estimate the number of dogs in all settlements in each study area, and throughout Primorskii Krai, across 1,000 replicates. CDV Exposure History. Samples from tigers and other large-bodied wild carnivores were obtained from the archives of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) (Bronx, NY) and were collected from wild carnivores captured for research purposes or in response to incidents of human- carnivore con- flict in Primorskii Krai Krai (six an-imals) and Amurskaya Oblast (one animal) between November 1992 and November 2014. These included samples from 40 tigers described previously by Goodrich et al. (32). Serum samples from small-bodied mesocarnivores were obtained from animals captured specifically for this project, and from archived material.Captures took place in Lazovskii Zapovednik (during May 2013, and October/ November 2013), and SABZ (April/May 2014), using folding cage traps (Tomahawk and Havahart). Archived material included samples collected in LLNP during 2007 to 2008 (by the Federal Scientific Center of East Asian Terrestrial Biodiversity, Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladivostok; and the NIH/National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD), Lazovskii Zapovednik during 2008 to 2009 (by the Zoological Society of London), and from SABZ between 2005 and 2011 (by WCS). Wildlife samples were storedat20 \u00b0C for up to 8 y prior to export, after which they were transferred to80 \u00b0C, and shipped using dry ice for analysis. Serum samples from dogs were collected in conjunction with rural questionnaire surveys and from 11 additional communities in LLNP, from dogs whose owners provided informed consent. Serum from vaccinated tigers was generously donated by E. Ramsay, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN (23). Antibody titers were measured using virus neutralization at the Wash- ington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Washington State University(tigers and other large-bodied wild carnivores), and by the Veterinary Di-agnostic Services at the University of Glasgow (mesocarnivores and domesticdogs). The methods used in both laboratories were based on Appel andRobson (33). Final antibody titers were calculated using the Spearman - Karber method (34). Titers 1:16 were considered to be positive to reduce numbers of false positives due to nonspecific neutralization at lower titers.Only serum neutralization titers from animals greater than 4 mo old wereincluded in data analyses, to exclude possible maternally derived antibodies.Seroprevalence was considered to be the number of animals testing positive,divided by the total number of animals tested. The R package \"prevalence \" (35) was used to calculate 95% binomial confidence intervals for allseroprevalence estimates. CDV Molecular Analyses. Domestic dog samples were obtained from two sources: 1) clinically healthy dogs sampled during household surveys, and 2) dogs presented for treatment at veterinary clinics. Household samples werecollected from all dogs whose owners consented to sample collection during Fig. 2.

Nasal swabs were preserved in 300 L of RNAlater stabilizing reagent (Qiagen), and whole blood was collected from the cephalic vein into Vacu-tainers containing EDTA as an anticoagulant (Becton, Dickinson and Com- pany). All samples were then frozen (at 20 \u00b0C or lower) until analysis. State and private veterinarians in rural and urban areas agreed to par- ticipate in the collection of clinical samples from sick dogs using a broad case definition, to maximize the chances of detecting CDV infections. Veteri-narians were requested to collect conjunctival and nasal swabs in RNAlaterfrom all dogs displaying any combination of upper respiratory disease,oculonasal discharge, gastrointestinal disease, and/or neurological signs. Participating veterinarians were based in the city of Vladivostok, town of Arsenev, and the districts of Lazovskii, Ussuriyskii, Nadezhdinskii, Khankayskii,Khasanskii, Dalengorskii, and Partizanskii. Tissue samples were obtained from small-bodied wild carnivores (meso- carnivores) with the assistance of state hunting inspectors in the districts of Terneiskii, Lazovskii, and Pozharskii. These inspectors contacted local furtrappers authorized to capture fur-bearing species during the winter hunt- ing seasons of 2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014. Additional samples were obtained from dead mesocarnivores encountered opportunistically,including road traffic accidents, or animals found dead in the forest, andfrom tigers and bears during routine necropsy examinations. Approximately30g of brain tissue from each animal was frozen at 20 \u00b0C in 1 mL of RNAlater. In addition, frozen tissue samples and blood products wereobtained from the archives of WCS. Blood products were also selected for RNA extraction from animals with measurable titers of serum antibodies of at least 1:16. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks of tissue that had pre- viously been analyzed by Seimon et al. (7) were selected for further ex-traction, with the objective of extending published sequences. Following theanimal codes used by Seimon et al. (7), these included the confirmed CDVcases PT61/Pt 2004, Pt 2010-2, and from suspected case PT90/Pt 2010-1. Sanger Sequencing. In preparation for RNA extraction, samples were centri- fuged at 17,562 rcf for 5 min, to facilitate the removal of RNAlater. Tissue samples were macerated in 200 L of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen), with 1% -mercaptoethanol and 5 L of 3U proteinase-K, vortexed regularly, and in- cubated for 1 to 3 h at 56 \u00b0C, until completely homogenized. RNA was extracted from tissue homogenates using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer 's instructions. Extraction of RNA from nasal swabs, whole blood, blood clots, and scat samples was performed using the QIAamp Cador Pathogen kit (Qiagen), using manufacturer 's instructions. All extracts were initially screened by qPCR for a 114-bp fragment of the P-gene based on previously described protocols (36). Reactions were per- formed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR CDVF4 TaqMan probe in channel ( SI Ap- pendix , Table S5 ). All reactions included a negative control, and a synthetic CDV sequence as a positive control. Reactions were performed using a Bio- Rad Minopticon Cycler through 45 cycles, with a transcription step of 20 minat 50 \u00b0C, and an annealing step of 30 s at 60 \u00b0C. Wells with characteristicamplification curves of cycle threshold <38 were considered to be positive. Samples that tested positive in at least one of three wells then underwent additional rounds of RT-PCR amplification, using primer sets for a 429-bp fragment primers Appendix Bio-Rad Min- opticon Cycler through 45 cycles, with a transcription step of 30 min at 50 \u00b0C, and an annealing step of 60 s at 45 \u00b0C. Products were separated by elec- trophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, and all extracts that produced bands of the expected molecular weight using both sets of primers were prioritizedfor further amplification and sequencing. Prioritized extracts were amplified by RT-PCR, using four sets of primers that covered the entire H-gene, modified from M\u00fcller et Appendix using a Bio-Rad Minopticon Cycler through 45 cycles, with a transcription step of 30 min at 50 \u00b0C, and an annealing step of 55 s at 45 \u00b0C. Products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2.0% agarose gel, andbands of the expected molecular weight were cleaned using the ExoSAP-ITreagent (Affymetrix) and directly sequenced in the forward and reversedirections (Genewiz). For positive samples that did not yield full-length H-gene consensus se- quences, DNA cloning techniques were employed to obtain additionalsequences. Further DNA cloning was used to obtain near full-length F-gene sequences for all samples from which full-length H-genes were sequenced. RNA extracts were used to prepare cDNA for DNA cloning using the Proto- Script First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs) followingmanufacturer 's protocols, excluding the optional RNA denaturation step. The first strand DNA product was then amplified using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) (Applied Bio- systems) through 35 cycles (with a denaturation step of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, an annealing step of 50 to 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and an extension step of 72 \u00b0C for 20 s). A second round of DNA amplification was performed using primersAmurtigercdvHsalF and ognition sites for the SalI and NotI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). DNA fragments were then ligated in to the pVR1012 eukar yotic expression vector (Vical) and transformed into Escherichia coli .C l o n e dD N Aw a s amplified, purified, and directly s equenced in the forward and reverse direction using a Pacific Biosciences PacBio RS II sequencer (operated byGATC Biotech). Next-Generation Sequencing. Sectioning. A 10-y-old FFPE brain tissue sample was available for analysis (from tiger PT61/Pt 2004). The 20 \u00d720-m sections were cut with a micro- tome in strictly sterile conditions. All areas including the microtome were treated with 10% bleach and RNA-Zap prior to sectioning of each sample. Excess paraffin was removed with a fresh scalpel (new scalpels were used foreach biopsy sectioned). Sections were placed in Eppendorf tubes (four pertube) and 1 mL of xylene was added to each tube in a fume hood. A Qiagen FFPE RNeasy kit was then used to extract RNA according to the manufac- turer 's instructions following the xylene extraction protocol. Two protocol deviations were made. First, the DNase step was reduced from 15 to 5 min inorder to minimize the loss of RNA, and second, RNA was concentrated by running the whole sample through the same minielute column. RNA was eluted in 14 L and frozen at 80 \u00b0C prior to use for library preparation. cDNA synthesis. cDNA synthesis was carried out with random hexamers using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer' s instructions. Double-stranded cDNA was produced using a NEBNext Second Strand Syn-thesis kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer 's instructions. Library preparation. A KAPA DNA library preparation kit (KAPA BioSciences) was used to prepare the cDNA for Illumina sequencing, with the followingmodifications to standard protocol. In order to minimize sample loss, a \"with- bead \"approach was used \u2014AMPureXP beads were retained during all li- brary preparation steps (38). To compensate for the low sample input, 150fmol of NEBNext adapter (New England Biolabs) were used for ligation(a 1,000-fold reduction from standard protocol). Adapter-ligated DNA was amplified on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR cycler, using a Real-time amplification enables thereactions to be stopped after the optimum number of PCR cycles, avoidingover- or under-amplification of library DNA. Index tags were added using NEBNext multiplex oligos. Library DNA concentration was assessed with the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer, and an Agilent 2200 TapeStation was used to verifythe final size profile of amplified library DNA and ensure no carryover of primer dimers. Up to six DNA libraries with appropriate index tags were pooled, and 2 \u00d7150-nt paired-end sequence datasets were v2 reagents. Bioinformatic analysis. Raw examined for quality using FastQC and adaptors and low-quality sequence removed. A de novo assembly was carried out following removal of mammalian DNA sequences using Spades(39), and Tanoti ( https://www.bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/Tanoti/ ) was then used to map sequence reads to the CDV contig and to the nearestreference sequence. Phylogenetic Analysis. Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm within the software Geneious (version 8.1.8) and were edited manually. Appropriate nucleotide substitution models were identified using jModeltest 2, version 2.1.8 (40, 41), with best-fit models selected based on lowest Akaikeinformation criterion scores. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for theH-genes and F-genes using Bayesian inference. The Shimodaira -Hasegawa test was used to confirm that there was no significant difference betweenthe topology of the H-gene and F-gene trees and the H-gene and F-genes were concatenated to increase confidence in the constructionof the final tree. The final tree was based on the GTR+G nucleotide substi- tution model 6o f9 |www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2000153117 Gilbert et al.Downloaded 23, 2020 (Version 3.2.6), with 1,100,000 iterations, subsampling every 200 trees and discarding 25% of samples as burn-in (42). Pseudotype Microneutralization. The recombinant VSV in which the glyco- protein (G) gene has been deleted (VSV G) and replaced with firefly lucif- erase ( luc) has been described (43, 44) and was kindly provided by Michael Whitt, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN. An initial stock of VSV Glucbearing VSV-G was used to infect 293T cells VSV-G expression vector Gluc(VSV-G) pseudotypes were recovered, titrated on 293T to prepare aworking stock of VSV Gluc(VSV-G) pseudotypes. To prepare CDV H and F expression constructs, viral RNA was prepared from mesocarnivore tissue samples (AllPrep DNA/RNA cDNA Kit; Roche), and then as template in PCRs with the following primers: CDV H Sal, 5 High Fidelity PCR were with the following thermocycling condi-tions: denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s,annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 60 s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 120 s, with a finalextension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Products were digested with the enzymes SalIand NotI and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector VR1012 (Vical).Canine SLAM-F1 (dogSLAM) was amplified from total RNA prepared canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells using PCR (Q5 following thermocycling conditions: denaturation at98 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 65 \u00b0C for30 s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. The amplified cDNA was cloned into the pDisplay eukaryotic expression vector (Life Technologies) using BglII and SalI. The nucleic acid sequences ofall primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. To prepare target cells for the VSV- G(CDV) pseudotypes, HEK293 cells MW 25,000 (Polysciences), and selected in complete medium supplemented with 800 g/mL G418. The stably transfected 293-dogSLAM cells were ex- panded and the surface expression of SLAM confirmed by flow cytometry using rabbit polyclonal anti-H (Sigma) followed by antibodies were determined by pseudotype virus neutrali- zation assay (4). A total of 2 \u00d710 4293-dogSLAM cells was plated into each well of a 96-well white flat-bottomed plate (Culturplate-96; Perkin-Elmer). Fourfold serum mediumranging from 1:8 to 1:32,768. The diluted serum samples were then added tothe 293-dogSLAM pseu- dotype. Plates were incubated for 48 to 72 h at 37 \u00b0C, at which time lucif-erase substrate was added (Steadylite plus; Perkin-Elmer) and the signal on a Microbeta Jet luminometer (Perkin-Elmer). Antibody titers were calculated by interpolating the point at which there was a 90%reduction in luciferase activity (90% neutralization). Vaccination Model. A stochastic population viability model developed by Gilbert et al. (8) was extended to assess the feasibility of vaccination strat- egies to reduce the 50-y extinction probability of the small isolated pop-ulation of Amur tigers in the vicinity of LLNP. The extended model includes avaccinated state, giving an SVIRD model with five possible infection statesfor each individual tiger \u2014susceptible, vaccinated, infected, recovered and dead, respectively \u2014on top of their demographic characteristics (described in ref. 8 and summarized below). The model was discrete time (operating on a2-wk time step), stochastic, and individual-based and was developed in theobject-oriented programming language Ruby, version 2.3.0. Following ref. 8, we assumed a closed population of tigers allotted to two social categories: territory holders that retained ownership of their territory until death, and nonterritory holders that move throughout the landscape until encountering a vacant territory. Available habitat was considered sufficient to support six male territories and nine female territories. Onlyterritory holders were permitted to reproduce. Parameters used for repro-duction and survival are summarized in Gilbert et al. (8). The model was allowed a burn-in period of 40 y to achieve a dynamic equilibrium in population size, followed by a 50-y study period, wherebyCDV infection is introduced into the population and vaccination commences. Only simulations where population size at the start of the 50-y study periodfell in the range of 15 to 27 tigers were used to assess 50-y extinctionprobability. Populations were assessed over 1,000 simulations and 50-y ex- tinction probability calculated as the percentage of simulations where population size declined to zero. Tigers contracted infections in one of three ways: 1) when predating in- fected dogs, 2) when predating infected wild carnivores, and 3) during socialcontact with infected tigers. The probability of a susceptible tiger acquiring infection in a given time step is given by 1 (1p) c, where cis the number of effective contacts per time step (i.e., those where transmission would occur should the contact be with an infectious individual), and pis the prevalence of CDV shedding among those contacts, which may be tigers, other wildcarnivores, or domestic dogs. Infection parameters are summarized in SI Appendix , Table S6 . The number of predated dogs and wild carnivores was generated from a Poisson distribution. To reflect uneven distribution of dogs, predation was restricted to 80% of territories where human settle-ments were estimated to occur. All nonterritory holders were considered capable of dog predation as they were assumed to disperse more widely including into areas of modified habitat. Predation of wild carnivores waslimited to time steps between early April and early November, when mostspecies are more active. Tigers maintain territories that largely excludemembers of the same sex; therefore, individuals could only contract CDVfrom members of the opposite sex. Dependent cubs automatically contractCDV if their mothers are infected, and do not survive if their mother dies. Mortality from CDV infection was estimated as 35% for all ages of tiger, and surviving tigers recovered after 45 d. The prevalence of domestic dogs infected with CDV was estimated using a catalytic model based on the age-stratified serological data collected fromunvaccinated dogs in the study communities (46). The number of seroposi-tive and seronegative dogs in each age category kis given by n pos(k)a n d nneg(k), respectively, where the kth age category contains animals in the age range k1t o kyears. npos(k) represents the number of dogs surviving in- fection, and can be used to estimate the number of animals that have been infected ninf(k) for a given CDV mortality ratio M(defined as the proportion of infected dogs that die from the infection) given by the following: ninf(k)=npos(k) (1M). The proportion of dogs infected by a given age is assumed to follow acatalytic model, i.e., the population is assumed to be subject to a constant f o r c eo fi n f e c t i o n , . We therefore assume that the proportion p inf(k)o fd o g s infected by the time they reach age category iis given by the following: pinf(k)=1eak, where akis the midpoint of the kth age category. The likelihood contribu- tion of each age category iwas then given by the following: ninf(k)log (pinf(k))+nneg(k)log (1pinf(k)). An estimate of was derived using the maximum likelihood with CIs obtained using the likelihood ratio test. Assuming that CDV infections did not occur seasonally, mean infection prevalence Pwas estimated assuming a mean period of infection Iof 21 d (47): P=I 365. Estimated was 0.134 (CI: 0.116 to 0.154) cases per dog per year, which equates to a mean prevalence of 0.77% assuming Mof 0.35 (47). Control scenarios were run both with and without CDV to determine baseline extinction probabilities. Two vaccine scenarios were used to simulate alternative vaccination parameters. These included an annual vaccinationprogram, in which two tigers were vaccinated each year. A reactive vacci- nation scenario was also used, where vaccine was only delivered after the detection of an outbreak and were given to two tigers. The probability ofoutbreak detection was given by the following: 1(1) c, where cis the expected number of tiger deaths as a consequence of infec- tion and is the probability of finding a dead tiger in a condition where diagnosis would be possible. The value of was estimated to be 0.25, based on the fate of tigers identified in camera traps in the SABZ between 2006and 2013 (48). Gilbert et al. PNAS Latest Articles |7o f9 ECOLOGYDownloaded by guest on November 23, 2020 Vaccines were administered randomly to adult tigers irrespective of ter- ritorial status, or stage of infection or immune status. For infected tigers, vaccination did not act therapeutically; consequently, their infection status remained unchanged. Vaccines were assumed to be 90% effective (inducing protective immunity in 90% of individuals that received a single dose) and toprovide lifelong protection from infection with CDV. Mean costs of vaccination scenarios were estimated over 50 y based on the mean number of tigers vaccinated across all 1,000 simulations. Budgetscomprised equipment costs to set up each capture team, and the mean costsof salaries, supplies, living expenses, and fuel per tiger captured (SI Appendix , Table S7 ). All equipment was replaced every 10 y to simulate regular wear and tear. Capture effort per tiger was based on Goodrich et al. (49), which describes 19 tigers captured over 12,287 trap nights between 1992 and 1998.Assuming one capture team can monitor a trap line of 15 snares, one tiger would be captured every 43.1 d. With captures timed for two 43-d trapping seasons in the spring and autumn, it would be reasonable for one captureteam to capture and vaccinate a mean of two tigers per year. Costs wereestimated over the 50-y study period, and effects of inflation were excluded.Data Availability.

Neutralizing antibody titers of seven tigers vaccinated with the modified live vaccine Nobivac DP (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) as assessed using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing the H and F glycoproteins of the Russian viral strain (KX708722). Increasing titers of neutralizing antibodies following vaccine administration confirm that sera from vaccinated tigers were able to neutralize the wild strain circulating in tiger habitat. 3 Fig. S2. Map demonstrating the exposure of domestic dogs and wild carnivores to canine distemper virus (CDV) across results from live-sampled wildlife are indicated as pie charts that are scaled based on sample size, indicating proportions of positive samples with canine distemper virus (CDV) neutralizing antibodies (black) and negative samples (white). These combine data from all sampled Amur tigers, Far Eastern leopards, Eurasian lynx, leopard cats, brown bears, Asiatic black bears, raccoon dogs, red foxes, Asian badgers, sable, Siberian weasels and American mink. Seroprevalence of unvaccinated domestic dogs sampled in the three study areas (Land of the Leopard National, LLNP - SABZ - blue) are illustrated by the bar chart in the insert panel. 4 Table S1. Results of virus neutralization analyses against canine distemper virus (CDV) for serum samples collected from wild carnivores in the Russian Far East between 1992 and 2014. Neutralizing antibody titres of 1:16 or higher were considered positive. Animals aged three months or younger have been excluded. Seroprevalence is given as the number of positive samples expressed as a percentage of sample size, with lower and upper 95% binomial confidence intervals (CI). * Samples tested at Washington State University against CDV Onderstepoort strain. Samples tested at the University of Glasgow using Onderstepoort strain (Bussell derivative). SpeciesPositiveSample sizeSeroprev. Table S2. Published density estimates (animals/km2) for the four most abundant mesocarnivore species in Primorskii Krai. Low and high density estimates are based on non-urban settings within published sources, giving preference to Russian sources where available. Density estimates are not available for Asian badgers, so the range quoted refers to the closely related Eurasian badger (Meles meles), to which the taxon was formerly considered conspecific. Density estimates are extrapolated across the 155,000 km2 distribution of the Amur tiger (4) to produce low and high population estimates.

Summary of samples tested for the presence of canine distemper virus (using either CDVF4/CDVR3 or Morb1/Morb2 primers), and of haemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) genes sequenced. * The 205 whole blood samples were analysed from a subset of the 633 dogs tested during passive surveillance, and so do not represent additional individuals. ** Refers to a partial length sequence. Figure includes an H gene from which a gap of 442 base pairs could not be sequenced. \u00a7 Full virus genome obtained from surveys Archived blood 7 Table S4. A summary of complete (COMP) and partial (PART) haemagglutinin gene (H) and fusion gene (F) sequences obtained from carnivores in the Russian Far East.

Estimated budget for capturing and vaccinating tigers in Primorskii Krai. Budgets are based on 1) the cost of equipping a capture team that is able to vaccinate up to two tigers per year, and 2) the cost of supplying each capture team estimated on a per tiger basis. Costs are estimated in US dollars. * Fuel costs are based on the expense of running a diesel Toyota Land Cruiser with estimated fuel consumption of 15 liters per 100 km and a diesel cost of $0.70 per liter. Vehicles would be required to make two round trips of 100 km per week to keep capture teams supplied while in the field. 1.
