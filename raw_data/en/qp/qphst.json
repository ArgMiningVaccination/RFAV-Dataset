Health Benefit: Beans can prevent heart disease Studies have shown that people who eat more legumes have a lower risk of heart disease, and the phytochemicals found in beans might be partially to thank since they protect against it. A 2017 review of medical studies in the journal BioMed Research International found that [high legume intakes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688364/) are associated with a lower risk of premature death\u2014and in particular cardiovascular disease-related death. Health Benefit: Beans can fight cancer Beans contain a wide range of cancer-fighting plant chemicals, specifically, isoflavones and phytosterols, according to the [American Chemical Society](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031205053236.htm), and all can help reduce cancer risk. (Doctors don't eat these [cancer-causing foods](https://www.thehealthy.com/cancer/cancer-causing-foods/).) Health Benefit: Beans can lower cholesterol Beans provide the body with soluble fiber, which plays an important role in controlling blood cholesterol levels. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources says that 5 to 10 grams of [soluble fiber](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/heart/chol_tlc.pdf) a day\u2014the amount in 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of navy beans\u2014reduces LDL cholesterol by about 3 to 5 percent.

Health Risk: Beans can cause migraines Some beans and legumes contain a substance called tyramine It can [trigger migraines](https://headaches.org/2007/10/25/low-tyramine-diet-for-migraine/), according to the National Headache Foundation.
