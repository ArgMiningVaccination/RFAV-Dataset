Here is a report by Ren\u00e9 Becker (France), Peter Glasby (Australia), Kristina Lucia Parmentier (Belgium) and Hartwig Schiller (Germany) along with Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato from the Executive Council at the Goetheanum. Way of Working: German or English is spoken without translation. In - stead of the traditional shared study of a text, the third Letter to the Members served as the background for our conver - sations about the tasks that lie ahead. World Conversation: Helmut Goldma - nn (Austria) discussed threshold experi - ences in light of the first three leading thoughts. Reports from New Zealand and Japan illustrated their precarious situation as a threshold experience. Such experiences are a challenge in daily life, but more freeing on the path of school - ing. Critical help comes from a spiritual community, in conversation. Anthroposophical Society: The theme for 2012/13 (\"Identity of the Anthropo - sophical Society\") continues as \"On the Being and Life of Anthroposophical Society,\" the theme for 2013/14. Hartwig Schiller: \"With this theme we look at what we experience as reality and at our inner impulses.\" Paul Mackay: \"Initiative in the framework of the Society does not mean advancing our own goals; it means making room for initiatives by connect - ing, supporting, and transforming. The quality of the Anthroposophical Society comes to the fore in destiny moments.\" School for Spiritual Science: Marc Desaules (Switzerland) discussed how pupils in the old Mystery Schools were made subordinate to the Mystery truths; the needs of the pupil were unimport - ant. However, the individuality of the pupil is a part of the new Mysteries. The vow became a free relationship, the pupil became a member, the teacher a leader or a member of the leadership. The readi - ness to represent is central.Society, School, and Applied Fields: The threshold for membership in the So - ciety is seen as too high; for the School, as too low. For instance, anyone working as a biodynamic farmer represents the School for Spiritual Science even if he or she is not a member. The earlier gen - eration represented anthroposophy by founding, lecturing, and publishing, but the newer generation finds anthroposo - phy already here on the earth. For it, an - throposophy lives in human capacities. How can the initiatives find a connection to the Society and the School? Co-option of Joan Sleigh: Awareness of this led to Joan Sleigh's nomination to the Executive Council ( Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 7-8/2012). If confirmed by the membership she will be the first to bring an experience of motherhood and the Southern Hemisphere to the Execu - tive Council. Seija Zimmermann: Seija Zimmer - mann's first seven years on the Goethea - num Executive Council were reviewed in light of a renewal. The General Secretar - ies' meeting recommends to the Annual General Meeting that she be confirmed for a further seven years on the Council. Expanded Executive Council: The Gen - eral Secretaries' meeting confirmed the expanded Executive Council for another year with members of the Goetheanum Executive Council, Marc Desaules (Swit - - sentatives of Francophone countries have decided to translate every issue of Anthroposophy Worldwide (ten times a year) into French. | Sebastian J\u00fcngel2 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 100% Dear Member of the Anthroposophical Society As your new treasurer I would like to send warm greetings from the Goetheanum this year and personally ask for your help in the ongoing work of the Goetheanum as the School for Spiritual Science (with its Sections, its stage, its archive, and its building). Paul Mackay has passed along a well prepared budget, and all of our c. 180 colleagues and every department of Goetheanum have worked hard during 2012 to keep strictly within it. Now\u2014at year's end\u2014the Goetheanum has two pressing needs that you can help with: \u2014 The budget includes the donation of two million Swiss francs as undesig - nated gifts. At this point we are quite a bit short of that goal. Can this gap still be filled through a combination of many small gifts and a few large ones? That is the only way we can end our current fiscal year with a balanced budget, and only then can we \u2014 Begin the big 2013/2014 con - struction project for the maintenance, renewal, and empowerment of the Goetheanum in good conscience, and use legacies and bequests for the proj - ect. We have set an initial goal of receiv - ing 4.5 million Swiss francs by January, 2013, so that we can contract for the renovation of the stage and the Norwe - gian slate roof. We are already within 500,000 francs of reaching that goal! Now\u2014after last year's internal and external difficulties\u2014we have the basis for new developments at the Goethea - num: Section leaders and Executive Council are working well and collegially in the newly formed Goetheanum Lead - ership. Our pending issues can be ad - dressed and gradually resolved. This year it seems that the entire anthroposophical world has entered inwardly and outwardly into a more in -tense encounter with the Goetheanum as a spiritual center: the regular large meetings of farmers and the medical movement, and the 1,000 attendees at the World Kindergarten Teachers Conference together with the 1,000 at the World Teachers Conference. The Goetheanum gives full expression to what anthroposophy does in the world. Along with several performance cycles of the Mystery Dramas (continu - ing to summer, 2013) there was also the moving summer conference to cele - brate eurythmy (now 100 years young). What a colorful coming and going and earnest seeking during the many con - ferences and meetings in this most important place where Rudolf Steiner worked! Most recently, 600 members of the School for Spiritual Science from 30 countries gathered at the Goetheanum during Michaelmas. At the same time, financial pressures during the last years have made it im - possible to address some truly pressing issues. Here, for instance, an important task is not taken up by a Section be - cause the means for an honorarium or part-time staff are lacking; there, the re-establishment of the Art Section or the continuation of the Literary Arts and Humanities Section needs funding, or the precious architectural plans for the First Goetheanum as well as works of art by Rudolf Steiner's pupils are threatened with decay because there is no money for proper archiving. Finally, time is lost on the oft-admired exterior of the Goetheanum when, for example, it takes hours to clear gravel from the Goetheanum drain system merely be - cause we lack the 30, 000 francs for a long-term solution. Beginning in 2013 we (as staff) and you (as members) will face something that is a real pleasure\u2014but also a chal - lenge. Beginning with FY 2013 and af - ter many years of talks, the Anthropo -sophical Societies in Germany and in Switzerland\u2014in collaboration with the Rudolf Steiner Nachlassverwaltung and the General Anthroposophical Society (Goetheanum)\u2014have decided to offer joint basic support for the Rudolf Stein - er Archive in House Duldeck as well as the documentation department at the Goetheanum (with its library, archive, and collection of paintings and sculp - tures). This responsibility will be met in the form of a \"Support Fund for Rudolf Steiner's Cultural Legacy.\" As of now it will not support new editions in the col - lected works or other important proj - ects\u2014these would have to be financed on a project basis\u2014but there would be ongoing preservation and access sup - port for the Nachlass and the Dornach archive. This calls for an annual total of about 750,000 francs (625,000 euros) a year; at this point only about two thirds of this amount has been received. Your large or small gift will also support this historic new step in preserving Rudolf Steiner's legacy. Please help the Goetheanum with your donation as it continues to further Rudolf Steiner's work and support the cultivation of anthroposophy around the world through the School for Spiri - tual Science. | Justus Wittich for the Goetheanum Executive Council Donations can be Worldwide No. 12/12 | 3 Anthroposophical Society Goetheanum A month prior to Sergei Prokofieff's illness the members present at the 2011 Annual General Meeting gave him a resounding vote of confidence for his continued work as a member of the Ex - ecutive Council. On the way to recovery, but still 90% convalescent, he continued his writing this year, and gave a lecture during the 2012 Annual General meeting in remembrance of Rudolf Stein - er's death day. In his lecture, he expressed con - cern about the present course of the Goetheanum, and this (together with a talk by Peter Selg) led to a number of conversations among the members. Since then, the two lec - tures have been published. Different Views On October 30 we were able to have a conversation with Sergei Prokofieff and Peter Selg within the Executive Coun - cil\u2014expanded to include General Secre - taries Marc Desaules (Switzerland), Ron Dunselman (Holland) and Hartwig Schil - ler (Germany). The meeting began with Sergei Proko - fieff and Peter Selg describing the con - cerns they had expressed on March 30, 2012 during the Annual General Meet - ing at the Goetheanum. The serious and frank discussion that ensued made clear that the intention of \"more anthroposo - phy and esotericism\" and loyalty to Ru - dolf Steiner was a common aim, but that the approaches to this were quite varied. There was also a critical look at our work together in the Executive Council over the last ten years. We could no longer assume a shared picture\u2014also among members worldwide\u2014of the task of the Goetheanum, the School, and the Execu - tive Council. This picture needs to be de - veloped out of our work together.Speaking for the Executive Council, Paul Mackay described the difficulty that arose because he had felt bound by the agreement reached with Sergei Prokofieff to keep him informed in writ - ing during his illness and recovery, but to spare him all the manifold inquiries, dis - cussions, and con - versations in the Executive Council. Thus since April, 2011, Paul Mackay had remained in contact with him only through the agreed-upon con - tact person, Seija Zimmermann. This was why there had been no further ex - changes during the last year and a half. The will to continue working with Sergei Prokofieff in the Executive Coun - cil\u2014after his recovery\u2014has been clearly stated by all who were present at the October 30 expanded Executive Council meeting and also those at the General Secretaries' meeting at the beginning of November. All six members of the Execu - tive Council share the goal of \"more an - throposophy\" as the main thrust in the future work of the Goetheanum. How - ever, there are varying approaches and views about how to achieve the desired changes and about what steps need to be taken if we are to reach this goal. Development of the Goetheanum This means that now and in the near future we\u2014as the carriers of responsibil - ity in the narrower and the wider sense; today this includes every member\u2014will have the special task of reaching a clear perception of how we wish to cultivate the development of the Goetheanum during the years to come. The currently active members of the Executive Coun - cil will make every effort to accomplish this task and work to include the various points of view. | Justus Wittich for the ex - panded Goetheanum Executive CouncilThe plan for financing the building project consists of three phases. By January 30 we need to have 4.5 million francs (3.75 euros) in hand so we can make a final decision about what can be done and then sign contracts for construction and materials. Ideally, we would have to have a second 4.5 million francs when the work begins on October 1, 2013, and the third 4.5 million by the festive re-opening of the stage at Michaelmas, 2014. Thanks to our reserve funds (2.5 million francs), gifts and construction notes to date (1.5 million), and including a large donation from Switzerland, our progress barometer now stands at 4 mil - lion francs (see the graphic on the right indicating the situation as of November 15, 2012). The General Secretaries' meeting at the Goetheanum (p. 1) was given a tour to see the damage in the concrete and the terrace, and the state of the stage. One thing became clear: the Goethea - num needs our help with this project. English, French, and Hungarian versions of the building appeal are underway, in India the appeal for Australia is being printed in color, and other efforts are be - ing planned. | Justus Wittich, Paul MackayGoetheanum Executive Council In Conversation with Sergei Prokofieff Between September and November three conversations were held with Sergei Proko-fieff within the Executive Council; he has been unable to take part in Executive Council business since April, 2011, because of serious illness.

Phase 3 Phase 2 Phase 14 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/12 Anthroposophical Society Belgium: found her way to anthroposophy through work in the office of a Belgian Waldorf School as well as introductory courses. There she came to know about eurythmy\u2014which would become her profession. She credits becoming the di- rector of the Steiner School for a year to her university degree\u2014in Chinese studies. Sebastian J\u00fcngel: Many European coun - tries are known for their chocolate\u2014in - cluding Belgium. How did Belgium hap - pen upon the cocoa bean? Kristina Lucia Parmentier: I don't know. The area once known as the Congo was a Belgian colony until 1960\u2014but I don't think that has anything to do with cocoa. In any case, Belgians love to eat choco - late, although probably not as much as the French. On the other hand, we Bel - gians claim that the Dutch aren't very good cooks... Walloons and Flemings J\u00fcngel: What can you tell us about the Walloons and Flemings?Parmentier: Today's northern France, Holland, and Belgium were ruled earlier by various kings. During the Reforma - tion, the Protestants migrated to the Netherlands while the Catholics re - mained in Flanders. This is evident in our languages even today: Dutch and Flem - ish are similar\u2014but differ in the way British and American English do. Flemish can be seen as a kind of older Dutch (only the Dutch in the earlier African colonies is older). Flemish is somewhere between English and German\u2014so German is eas - ier for us to learn than for the Walloons. Admittedly there are some pitfalls. In Germany you say a dog \"bellt\" [barks]; for us \"bellt\" is what bells in a tower do.J\u00fcngel: What about the reserved atti - tude towards Germans?Parmentier: This reserve is still appar - ent among those who lived through the Second World War. But there are even older reservations. The consolidation of Belgium and the Netherlands after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 lasted only until 1830 when Belgium asserted its independence from the Netherlands. At the time, the elite class spoke French; the normal people, the peasants, spoke Flemish. This is one source for the con - tinuing conflict between the Flemings and Walloons. My mother, who grew up in the Flemish part, had to speak only French in her school. At the retirement home where I work the Flemish women speak French, of course\u2014but with a Wal - loon they always speak Flemish. This distinction goes unnoted in our private lives where people can choose their language. The schools in each area speak the language of the area; the oth - er national language is not taught until grade 5. In a Wallonian region in eastern Belgium there is still a small German- speaking area that Germany was forced to cede after World War II. Attentive to Social Moods J\u00fcngel: How big are the differences and similarities in these neighboring areas? Parmentier: Walloons and Flemings live like fraternal twins. Travelling abroad, you notice your Belgian character more. Compared to the Dutch, French, or Ger - mans, our use of language is not as el - egant. For instance, although Flemings share a language with the Dutch and Walloons share a language with the French, I am always amazed by how beautifully thoughts can be expressed in these other languages. The Dutch are also verbally stronger. Often we Belgians have to consider how we want to react and what we want to say; thus we are reserved in our speech (and we tend to be rather quiet on a train or in a hotel). I notice an enormously forceful language and a zest for philosophizing among edu - cated Germans. When I was in the Youth Section at the Goetheanum in 1985/86, I knew hardly any German but marveled at the intensely theoretical way people spoke about a text by Rudolf Steiner. I was more interested in observing social moods. I had to overcome a large degree of antipathy in order to read the Philoso - phy of Freedom , for example. J\u00fcngel: Brussels, the European Union's \"capital city\" seems far away for many. What role does the presence of the EU play for Belgians? Parmentier: The EU seems far way to Belgian citizens as well. Many Belgians work in Brussels. However, the EU com - munity and its staff\u2014who earn far more than \"normal\" Belgians\u2014form their own community and they seem like a foreign country. J\u00fcngel: Are Belgians proud of EU in Brus - sels? Parmentier: Well, yes. But neither Flem - nor would cede Brussels. J\u00fcngel: To me, Belgians seem melanchol - ic. Do you share this impression?Parmentier: (Laughing) Melancholic\u2014 perhaps it stems from the fact that the weather is bad and it rains a lot. My youngest brother emigrated to Spain for this very reason ...In Belgium we live more in our feelings than the Dutch or the Ger - mans, and joy is found there as well. Mediator between Polarities J\u00fcngel: What spiritual tasks do you see for Belgium? Parmentier: In Belgium there are either Catholics or the non-religious (in a con - fessional sense). A third independent direction is gradually emerging. The task for us as anthroposophists, in my view, is to position ourselves in this third stream. I see the spiritual task of Belgium as re - newing the Catholic element through the new Christianity that anthroposo - phy helps to reveal. For me, Herman von Rompuy, the first full-time president of the European Council, represents a fur - ther spiritual quality: humility. Belgium can thus be a mediator between po - larities and help in understanding every Working with others as the basis for receiving the gifts of the spiritual world: Kristina Lucia Parmentier Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/12 | 5 Anthroposophical Society point of view, to seeking out the mid - point between polarities. No Home of its Own for the Society J\u00fcngel: How does anthroposophy live in Belgium? Parmentier: Steiner Schools are repre - sented strongly by about 15 schools, mostly in Flanders; one is in Brussels, one in Wallonia. In Flanders there are four curative education homes but none in the south. There are biodynamic farms in both parts of the country, but the fo - cus is in the south. Flanders has 4 or 5 doctors. My work\u2014I have been a curative eurythmist since last year\u2014is not recog - nized by health insurers. Thus I ask clinics whether they can use my services as a movement therapist. Unlike other countries, Belgium has al - most no branch life\u2014the phrase hardly exists. (Rudolf Steiner gave just one lecture in Belgium, in Brussels). In the south there are 2 or 3 groups; Ghent has an active group. But we have 500 mem - bers. About 50 people attend our Annual Meeting with an additional 70 votes rep - resented by proxy so that about a quarter of the membership is represented. One challenge we face is that the Anthropo - sophical Society in Belgium doesn't have a home of its own; it rents a small studio for its administrative offices. Thus our newsletter is a vital means of connec - tion. A few years ago it was divided with a Wallonian and a Flemish edition. The new General Council wants to reunite these parts\u2014in fact, the Walloons have little interest in the Flemish paper, and the Flemings have essentially no interest in the Wallonian edition ... Turning The Philosophy of Freedom into Spiritual Experience J\u00fcngel: What do you consider the most important tasks for the Anthroposophi - cal Society? Parmentier: It should be open to spiritu - ally seeking people\u2014also to those who are clairvoyant\u2014and take initiative to come into contact with these people. For me it therefore involves interest in the paths taken by others\u2014without aban - doning anthroposophy in the process. Another important task is the Philosophy of Freedom . We should not just approach it intellectually, knowing its content; it should become a spiritual experience. I find this lacking among us as anthro - posophists. J\u00fcngel: How did the office of General Sec - retary come your way?Parmentier: I was asked to become a member of the Council in April. There had been a crisis and only one member remained from before. Two years ago I had already resolved that I would want to participate on the Council if asked\u2014 even though it seemed to me at the time that it was all very bureaucratic, and for a while I had very little interest in the Anthroposophical Society. And then I was actually asked! There were others who had declined because they did not have the time for it. Of the three women remaining I had the most time to offer\u2014 I don't have a family and am employed part-time\u2014and, among the three, my German was the best. J\u00fcngel: What are your plans? Parmentier: Since this had not been part of my own interest earlier\u2014I was fo - cused primarily on eurythmy\u2014I would like to work with my Council colleagues to familiarize myself with all the an - throposophical initiatives in Belgium, and build contacts. I have also phoned the members who no longer contribute dues; I want to learn whether they wish to remain as members (and why). The Council also wants to invite new mem - bers to meet and speak with us every year. I do not know what lies ahead in the international realm\u2014the task is still so new.J\u00fcngel: What led you to China? Parmentier: My studies were in Sinology and I wanted to visit the country. After two futile attempts to get a stipend to visit China-or Japan\u2014the funding fi - nally came through in 1982. I was able to study in Shanghai. This was a signifi - cant experience for me. I had never been in a poor and communist country, and I experienced how thoroughly the old cul - ture of China was being eradicated. All the families I came to know in China had lost members in the cultural revolution. When I returned to Belgium I was once again shocked by the range of consumer goods available in Belgium: there wasn't just one kind of juice, chips, jam\u2014there were many! From Karate to Eurythmy J\u00fcngel: How did you come to eurythmy? Parmentier: That is a long story. I had thought that if I ever had children I would send them to a Steiner school. When I returned from China I lived with a boyfriend at the time and he had a three-year-old daughter. It was then that I became interested in the background of the Steiner school and found work there in the office. I attended courses on an - throposophy along with the parents. In 1984 I encountered eurythmy during the very first of these courses. Compared to karate (which I had practiced for six years during my student days) I found eu - rythmy pleasantly easy. Four years later I was studying eurythmy in the Hague. In 1987 the Steiner school was official - ly recognized and it needed a director. Since I had a university degree I accepted this office on an interim basis until the actual candidate became available. I was his assistant until I began my eurythmy studies in 1989. At the same time, I was the eurythmy teacher in the upper school for seven years\u2014but that became too much. I had a crisis in 2001 and wanted nothing more to do with anthroposophy. Exactly one month later the director of a retirement home asked me if I would be interested in doing eurythmy with the residents there. I actually didn't want to do this, but I let myself to be talked into it. Since then I have been at this retire - ment home one day a week as a euryth - mist, and I spend an additional day in the garden there\u2014work I know from when I trained as a eurythmist. Working with others as the basis for receiving the gifts of the spiritual world: Kristina Lucia Parmentier Photo: Supplied6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide Goetheanum School for Spiritual Science Section for Agriculture: Conference on \"New Ways to Regenerate the Grape\" Deepening Sensory Experience The Section for Agriculture and Demeter International held an international confer - ence on wine growing. Jean-Michel Florin and Ueli Hurter from the Section's leader - ship discuss the grape's importance for humanity, the interest shown in biodynamics by wine growers, and the relationship to alcohol.Goetheanum Leadership Prelude to Assignment The Goetheanum Leadership (members of the Executive Council and Section leaders) is looking at in-house areas of responsibility with a view to giving out assignments (Anthroposophy Worldwide, Nr. 11/2012, p. 10). The process will be ended in December\u2014here, a glimpse into the ongoing discussions.Sebastian J\u00fcngel: How are the grapes? Jean-Michel Florin: Not well. To under - stand this you need to know that wild grapes are meant to grow at the edge of the forest\u2014half in shade and in hu - mus. The cultivated grape is limited to a height of one or two meters, stands in full sun, and is often planted on the meager soil of a slope. The wild grape also lives in a highly diverse milieu of plants and animals, while the cultivated grape grows in a monoculture. Greeks and Romans planted grapes with olive trees and grain; the grapes could climb up the trees, as they still can today in Portugal. By the mid-19th century the cultivated grape had been so weakened that practically every vineyard in Europe was decimated by a phylloxera that at - tacked the roots. So-called rootstocks from the USA were planted and the vitis vinifera was grafted to it. This produced a basic conflict: The rootstock has much more life force than the graft\u2014new dis - eases were the result, especially fungus and wood necrosis. The outcome: copper and sulfur were used, and\u2014since World War II\u2014synthetic pesticides. Fruit trees and grapes are among the most stressed plants, far more than wheat or corn. Anchored to a Location J\u00fcngel: What is special about the grape? Florin: In the workers' lectures Rudolf Steiner said that walnut and linden trees in a landscape affect the astral body while the grape affects the ego (GA 353, p. 17f). Thus plants play an important role as a balancing agent. If we look at the image of the grape, it tries to grow upward, but cannot do so alone\u2014it needs our help. Many homeopathic and anthroposophic remedies (e.g. Hepatodoron) are made with grapes, alcohol, tartar, or wine vin - egar (see Der Merkurstab , No. 2/2010, p. 112-122). Grape sugar brings warmth and its vital forces invigorate. J\u00fcngel: What does the grape mean for humanity as compared to grain? Ueli Hurter: Of course we know bread and wine as the substances of the Last Supper. Wine has a connection to the Dionysian element, grain to the Apollo - nian. Wheat is a highly condensed sub - stance with a tendency to over-condense so that the Apollonian turns into the Ah - rimanic (stones instead of bread). The grape is a fruit that is in danger of ex - aggerating its appearance and giving an illusion of aroma, shape, and color that is not at all real\u2014a Luciferic tendency. With grain we need to add the quality of light in how we cultivate it, grow it, and pre - pare it by baking. The point with fruit is to make it \"real.\"Florin: The lily has a cosmic relationship and grain is connected to that with its gesture of ears devoted to the sun. But in watery fruits (Rosaceae and grapes) the gesture goes upward from earth: The earthly reaches for the heavens. The grape has a strong relationship to the soil it grows in; you can smell, see, and taste it in a product like wine. A connoisseur can taste the place, slope and year\u2014 e.g., \"chalk, southwest slope, 2006.\" This earthly differentiation is not so strong with grain. Amid the Contradictions of the Age J\u00fcngel: What makes it more attractive to produce wine from grapes rather than fruit or grape juice? Hurter: A bottle of wine simply has a higher net worth than a bottle of juice or a package of fruit. Also, the quality of type, place, and vintage really does not become evident until fermentation. Grape juice tends to be too sweet as a drink; the sweet-sour balance is better maintained in apple juice. Florin: We also need to remember that a hectare of vineyard worth a million euros (in Champagne) will bring in too little if it is used as a meadow\u2014maybe a thousand euros.J\u00fcngel: The use of the biodynamic meth - od in producing Demeter-quality wine (and thus, alcohol) is always \"justified\" by pointing to the element of freedom. The earthly reaches for the heavens: the wine grapeThere are three realms of responsi - bility at the Goetheanum: a realm where the work is visible to the public (building administration, reception and events, Goetheanum stage); depart - ments that service the infrastructure (e.g., data processing and personnel), and staff positions that report directly to a member of the Executive Council at the Goetheanum (those responsible for privacy protection and safety). The process of assigning responsibility will not alter the tasks for these realms. However, according to the spokespeople for the Goetheanum Leadership (Seija Zimmermann and Ueli Hurter) all the participants in the Goetheanum Lead - ership are motivated to find the right realm for each task, and to do so in a transparent way; in the process it will be important to keep in mind the realistic limitations imposed by time. \"Our hope,\" says Hurter, \"is that our common will can also become socially concrete through the process of assignment. Every assign - ment nourishes the will.\" Two departments at the Goethea - num\u2014the Goetheanum archive and communications (public relations, the weekly Das Goetheanum , and Anthro - posophy Worldwide )\u2014are currently un - der discussion.

Hurter: Here we enter into a legal area Therefore cocaine would be impos - sible,\u2014but tobacco would be. At the moment, the Demeter movement is dis - cussing what we should do about whisky (meantime, the first Demeter grain is being matured into whisky in Scottish barrels). Here we need to be aware of the following distinction: The Agricul - tural Section provides the knowledge base; the Demeter movement makes its decisions in response to inquiries and needs. For instance, a glass of whisky is embedded in the culture of Great Brit - ain. If someone wants to drink Demeter whisky, it is probably better than if the whisky were not produced with biody - namic grain. Another example: There are many mothers who cannot nurse or do not wish to nurse; they need to find a substitute for their children. These substitutes are highly processed and are required by law to contain vitamins (the resulting product has no relation at all to milk.) Demeter International thinks this situation is not ideal, but believes it is better if the child receives a Demeter- quality substitute nourishment rather than something else. As a biodynamic movement we stand in the world. In the case of the grape, it is the wine maker who comes to us.Florin: You must also know that some of today's most famous wine makers are working biodynamically, and this rep - resents a wonderful public recognition for the biodynamic approach. In view of the major environmental stress created by conventional wine growing, we are happy whenever a wine maker converts to biodynamics; then the earth is helped and a space is created for plants, ani - mals, and human beings to live in. Wine as an Educator of Taste Hurter: I also believe that the monocul - ture of the grape represents a bigger problem than the alcohol. The vineyard does not present the picture of a wholis - tically structured farm organism. This is one concern of our conference,; another concern is finding the best way to ap - ply biodynamic preparations. And do not forget: Rudolf Steiner's indications about alcohol refer to people who have consciously set out on a path of school - ing. They are not as relevant for people who have not chosen to do so. Demeter International is more and more coming to the conclusion that nutrition is be - coming increasingly individualized, and that individuals must make these deci - sions for themselves.Florin: Alcohol is also naturally present in the stomach, in juices, and it is also used as a preservative in anthroposophi - cal remedies. I do not mean to underes - timate the problem of alcoholism. We have an important job to do in making information available and offering a very exact description of alcohol's effect when it enters directly into the blood - stream where it will weaken the ego. Alcohol is certainly not a food; as wine, for instance, it is a luxury and a means of pursuing pleasure.But there is something that seems more important to me: Jean-Pierre Frick sees wine more as a stimulus for the senses than as a beverage. You can taste the wine rather than drinking it. The finer the wine's quality of taste, the finer the possibility of schooling the senses. If this capacity were also to be applied to \"real\" food we would have achieved a lot for bread or cheese (for example). I see it as a problem that Demeter products are often simply ingested without being consciously eaten. Wine could help us deepen our sensory experience. Read German?

What meaning does the sound of the soul have for you in melody, for instance, or the sound of matter in the noise element? Lampson: There is a basic difference be - tween melody and noise: noise is part of our day-to-day world. The fundamental element of melody is the musical tone, and this is already from another world. The musical tone is carried through and through by hearing; in the tone the sound releases itself from the mundane rela - tionship of noise. In listening, the musi- cal consciousness of tone can also en - counter the world of noise, or \"sounding\" as Heiner Ruland calls it. The sound then separates from the mundane context of noise and\u2014like the musical tone\u2014it be - comes the purely temporal phenomenon of musical listening. Thus the inner world of musical tone acquires a kind of min - eral outer world, but without losing the temporal quality of musical conscious - ness. A rich interplay, interpenetration, and sharp contrasts can arise among the musical tones, the intervals, the melo - dies, and this temporal forming of mate - rial sounds freed of their relation to the everyday world. The Mystery scenes take place in this col - orful, musical world of time. The sound and intonation in my pieces are alien - ated and expanded in their inner con - nection with the dramas\u2014for example, when the breathing of time is disrupted by the \"creaking\" noise of the strings in the scenes that take place in the ice- cold, deceptive world of Ahriman. Or\u2014at the beginning of the eighth scene in The Soul's Awakening \u2014when the Egyptian woman stands before the closed walls of the Egyptian temple and thinks with care and sorrow of the \"neophyte\" awaiting his initiation ritual in the temple; the old Egyptian mood of fifths sounds in a pentatonic flute melody above a cluster of notes that then changes into a dark G sharp minor chord in the temple. The ancient \"temple scales\" develop from this chord, these scales were discovered by Kathleen Schlesinger and further re - searched by Heiner Ruland who placed them into the development of human consciousness. The archaic sound of these old \"Mystery scales\" breaks off suddenly and turns into a jubilant major key when the neophyte gives expres - sion to the feelings in his own soul and or beauty\u2014like loving devotion.Lampson: This music does not have a simple beauty since it is subtly centered and yet diffuse, stable and unstable at the same time; one type of listening changes to another; transient forms arise. If you listen more closely to what is in the music, you can experience the inner ordeal produced by the encounter in beauty with the element of maya. Levels of Listening Consciousness J\u00fcngel: You had the constraint of writing program music. You work quite \"conven - tionally\" there: the soul element is me - lodic and carried by the flute; disruption is noisier, with percussion. Lampson: I did not think the Mystery Dra - mas were a \"programmatic constraint.\" I was interested in an inner agreement be - tween the music and the dramas, and a concentration of the music as a law unto itself; I experience the musical element as its own world, a world with a shim - mering play of colors, aroma, fragrance, light, air, warmth, and cold\u2014and erup - tions of natural forces, and the abysses of the human soul. That has nothing to do with a \"conventional\" approach.

It has been available on CD since mid- September in a performance by soloists from the International Mahler Orchestra. The composition will again be played live at the Goetheanum's Christmas conference Listening to the dramas\u2014aware of Lampson Photo: Torsten K ollmer Sebastian J\u00fcngel: When I listened to your music for Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas on CD I heard the inner connec - tion between the individual pieces more clearly than I did during the performance. You must have had this inner connection in mind from the beginning. What was your experience when you first heard the pieces in context? Elmar Lampson: I began by trying hard to listen to what was in the texts. The language was strange to me at first, but I soon noticed that these texts left an echo or afterimage in my feeling. There were delicate moods, very rever - ent moods like the echoes of something wonderful, ineffable, something that speaks in the way a glance speaks. The music then arose from these echoes. During the production on the stage a new element comes into being involving the different art forms. The effect this context had surprised me more than the concert version of the suite because the purely musical element was there from the very beginning.

The Elemental World in Music J\u00fcngel: If you were to characterize the el - emental world of the gnomes and sylphs, for instance, what would you find there? Lampson: Before beginning with the music I lived intimately with the various passages of text in the Dramas. Than I worked exclusively with the music. I do not understand the musical realities that arose to be images or projections of pre - vious experiences, but as realities sound - ing out of the elemental world. The crushing and splitting of the sounds, the rhythmic attacks that change quick as lightning\u2014these things release natural forces, but they do not destroy; instead, they \"harden\" and \"impel the glimmer - ing dust of matter\" as it says in those scenes. And the columns of triads that expand into the higher tones of nature bring a gleam that lacks any element of temptation, either from the human soul or from Lucifer. It makes the reality of the sounding ether and the weaving light something you can experience. Changing Levels of Reality J\u00fcngel: What did you learn about new ways to develop your music from your work with the Mystery Dramas? Or, put differently: Is your musical work on the Mystery Dramas now a closed chapter for you? Lampson: There is nothing I would rath - er do than go on writing music for other scenes! Gioia Falk and Christian Peter followed the principle of inserting music when levels of reality change, i.e., at the transitions among the physical world, the soul world, and the spiritual world. There is much more to develop further! We might be able to elicit every detail in the drama and raise it to a new level. We could bring out every scene and work on ever-new nuances in the language, the eurythmy, the light, the music, and all the other realms of the theater.

This decision was ini- tially reached at the annual general meeting of the Anthroposophical Society in Switzer - land on June 10, 1923. It reads: \"It is the wish of today's assembly of the Anthroposophi- cal Society in Switzerland that Dr. Steiner should take up the task of rebuilding the Goetheanum in Dornach. As the leading ar - tistic figure he is to be given full authority in every respect (including the use of funds designated for the purpose, and the choice of personnel) to complete the building in the way and form he thinks best without interference from the membership.\" On July 22, 1923 the delegates from the other countries also adopted this resolution. In his concluding remarks, Rudolf Steiner emphasized that this would certainly be a meeting to remember if the construction of the new Goetheanum would be the out - come.

See document 1.Doc. 1: Facsimile notes made on April 13, 1924 by Ernst AisenpreisLocation of the Sculpture Group in the Second Goetheanum From Rudolf Steiner's Ideas to the Present I. After the Fire at the First Goetheanum At the Anthroposophical Society's delegates' meeting in Dornach on July 20-23, 1923, Rudolf Steiner set two con - ditions for refounding an international Anthroposophical Society (which was planned for Christmas, 1923): This So - ciety was to accept the task of rebuild - ing the Goetheanum, and Rudolf Steiner himself was to given full freedom in de - signing the building. 1 In comparing the first and second Goetheanums, we might imagine the astonishment of the anthroposophists who saw Rudolf Steiner's just-complet - ed model (March, 1924) of the proposed second building. They carried a vivid im - age in their hearts of the building they had so recently lost, and they awaited a \"rebuilding\" in the same style. What they saw was not at all like what they expected. Guenther Wachsmuth 2 spoke for the uncertain mood on the hill when he asked Rudolf Steiner: \"Where are the columns and architraves and other tures?\" Rudolf Steiner answered: \"Well, I've learned something!\"3 At the end of September, 1924, a sickbed was set up for Rudolf Steiner in his atelier\u2014next to the unfinished wooden sculpture of the Representative of Humanity saved from the flames. He worked on the group until shortly before his death on March 30, 1925. He had also been able to finish a few initial sketches of the second Goetheanum's interior. And we have a small number of reliable reports about his statements on how he wanted the second Goetheanum to be finished and where he wished the sculp - ture to be placed. II. Chronology of the Three Statements by Rudolf Steiner on the Placement of the Group in the Second Goetheanum April 13, 1924 After seeing the model of the second building, Ernst Aisenpreis4 asked Rudolf Steiner about the future position of the group; he noted his questions (F) and Ru - dolf Steiner's answers (A): \"F: Where will the group be finished? A: Not in one of the eight rooms. F: Where is the group finally to stand in the building? A: On the east side of the stage. But the Dr. still needs to plan something for that, and it will not be easy to fit the group into the concrete building.\" 5 Comment: Rudolf Steiner did not say more about his plans; it may have been unnecessary since his later statements ran in a different direction.In view of the technical renovation of the stage planned for 2013/14, the issue of where the sculpture group should stand in the Goetheanum has once again come to the fore. In 2008 the Executive Council and Collegium had decided to keep the question open, although it was not a part of the short-term planning. This study by Uwe Werner shows the development of Rudolf Steiner's view of the issue; it is based on a critical reading of the traditional sources that can be given serious weight. The Executive Council and Collegium asked for this report in 2008. It is be - ing made available here as a basis for further research and conversation.

Document 2. Erika von Baravalle an - swered an inquiry from the Archive about why these notes were not published at the time, although they are important for an objective understanding: Rex Raab sent the memorandum to Albert von Baravalle for checking. The latter was not happy that he had been portrayed as an \"eavesdropper,\" since he had not intended to listen. Architect Hermann Ranzenberger had not been pres- ent, either. And the officials represented the Canton, not the town. This was why Raab did not publish the note, although he kept Rudolf Steiner's statement in his book. Since other important details are also addressed (like Marie Steiner's role in placement issue), we are publishing the memorandum here for the first time (with Erika von Baravalle's agreement). The memorandum is in the documentation at the Goetheanum. On the central point\u2014the placement of the group\u2014 both depictions are in general agreement. 9.

His many note - books are among the rare authentic and contemporary sources for the building's history. Some notes (including the one cited here) were given to the Art Section by his son, Markus Aisenpreis. Another part were probably kept in the building office after Aisenpreis' death in 1949 and came to the Goetheanum Archive at the end of 1990's. Today both are in the doc - umentation at the Goetheanum. A final notebook with notes for the period rele - vant to this discussion (January to March 1925) was not discovered until the Glass House was renovated in 2006/7\u2014it had slipped into a partition. August 4, 1924 In 2008 Erika von Baravalle, the wife of architect Albert von Baravalle,6 de- scribed the following from a 1969 con - versation between Albert von Baravalle and Rex Raab; she had also been present during the conversation: \"A part of the four-person architec - tural team since 1924, Albert von Bara - valle had naturally followed discussions [about fire safety for the sculpture\u2014 Uwe Werner ]. The construction office was in the large central room of the Glass House and conversations were easily overheard because of the thin wooden walls. One day, back in the room and busy drawing, he heard an important conversation in the next room between Solothurn build - ing officials and Rudolf Steiner. He could hear every word without trying: One of - ficial asked: 'Doctor, will you use wood again in the new building?' After a short pause, Rudolf Steiner answered: 'No! At most, in the room where the group stat - ue is displayed.'\" 7 Comment: Rudolf Steiner showed the model for the second building to the au -thorities in the Glass House on August 4, 1924. Albert von Baravalle told Rex Raab about this on December 14, 1969. Rex Raab thought the conversation so important that he recorded it in a mem - orandum, but did not publish it. 8 He did mention it in his Eloquent Concrete (1972), but dated it to June 1924 instead of August 4. 9 Here Rudolf Steiner does not explicitly speak of the stage as the future display space for the group. December 1924/January 1925 The technical drawings for the stage had arrived on December 28, 1924, and it became clear that the group could not be placed on the stage. This was why Guen - ther Wachsmuth asked Rudolf Steiner about the matter, as Emil Estermann 10 reported in 1982: \"This probably sealed the fact that the group could not be on the stage. Thus Dr. Wachsmuth asked Rudolf Steiner about the placement of the 'group.' Ernst Aisenpreis, who told me about this, reports what Dr. Steiner described to Dr. Wachsmuth: 'A room should be created in the east part of the building where the group can be placed so that it faces west.'\" 11 Comment: Emil Estermann's state - ment (published in 1982 in Art Section newsletters, ed.

Now, at the end of December, 1924/beginning of January, 1925, Rudolf Steiner speaks more pre - cisely about the position of the room in the Goetheanum and where the sculp - ture was to be placed in it. His view of the placement was not fixed\u2014it developed as planning for the building evolved. III. Progress of Construction and Plan - ning between January and March 1925 How is the issue of placing the Group reflected in the building's planning up to Rudolf Steiner's death? There is every reason to believe that Rudolf Steiner was quite involved in the practical develop - ment and detail planning for the build - ing until the end of his life, and that his views were followed by his colleagues. Ernst Aisenpreis' notebook found in 2007 (see above) covers the period from June, 1924, to March, 1925. They show that the final large demolition of the old concrete base was on Whitsunday, June 7, 1924. Then Aisenpreis states: \"Started pouring concrete on January 7, 1925.\" Excavation, formwork, and con - crete for the basement and foundations followed in the next months. On March 17, 1925: \"Strain on the rehearsal stage with stage construction\" and \"Prepara - tions since March 13, 1925 for disman - tling the Group in the atelier;\" on March 24: \"Excavation for foundations of the rehearsal stage south pillars,\" \"Rehearsal stage north pillar foundations poured,\" and again on March 25: \"rehearsal stage south pillars excavated.\" These notes show that the building had progressed only to the basement and the founda - tions, and say nothing about the future placement of the Group. \"Dismantling the Group\" refers to the 1:1 model in the upper atelier\u2014Rudolf Steiner planed to use the space for work on an interior model of the Hall and the stage. This was the progress shown in these notes. 14 What do the plans tell us? Kurt Re - mund, director of the Goetheanum Building Administration from 2002 to 2005, looked at this question using ma - terial from the design archive. The plans changed in accord with Rudolf Steiner's developing view. Strengthening the stage floor on the east (in order to permit placement of the Group on the stage) was part of the planning at first. How - ever, during Rudolf Steiner's lifetime the building was arranged to provide a place for the Group in its current location (as shown in the February 19, 1925 foun - dation drawings that were delivered on March 4, 1925). There is also an architec - tural drawing dated April 20, 1925 that shows the Group room in a cross-section of the south part of the building\u2014with a sketch of the group. Here it becomes clear how much effort was entailed in building a support structure to display the tonnage of the heavy, multi-level work of art. 15 The provision for a special load on the stage, however, was already gone in March, 1925.16 These results reveal that at the time of Rudolf Steiner's unexpected death the plans for the Group had moved from the Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/12 | 13 Goetheanum Doc. 4: Facsimile notes by Ernst Aisenpreis from February 26 to March 30, 1925 26f.\u2014Assya Turgenieff (1890-1966), for a time, companion of the Russian writer An - drei Bely (1880-1934). With Rudolf Steiner she developed a black-and-white diagonal shading technique that she went on to use in creating the glass etching for the colored windows of the second Goetheanum (fol- lowing themes of the first Goetheanum). 18. With Guenther Wachsmut (see above) the other General Anthroposophical Soci- ety Executive Council members who had a close working relationship with Rudolf Steiner were: Albert Steffen (1884-1963), Swiss poet and painter, one of Rudolf Stein - er's closest colleagues; after Rudolf Steiner's death in 1925 he served as the chair of the General Anthroposophical Society until his death in 1963. Marie Steiner von Sivers (1867-1948), editor and publisher of Rudolf Steiner's works, leader of the Performing Arts Section (including further develop - ment of eurythmy and speech formation), director of Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dra- mas and Faust I and II as performed on the stage of the second Goetheanum during the 1930's, married Rudolf Steiner in 1914. Ita Wegman (1876-1943), physician, leader of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum, worked with Rudolf Steiner on the devel- opment of anthroposophical medicine.

However, the east floor of the stage was also re - inforced, as you can see today; it is cur - rently unknown who decided that. IV. From Rudolf Steiner's Death to the Group's Removal to the Goetheanum The Executive Council and their col - leagues did not fully address the issue of the Group's placement until construc - tion had progressed on the new build -ing and the current \"Group Room;\" the danger of fire in the Carpentry Building made it advisable to move the statue to the concrete structure As Assya Turg - enieff 17 remembered in 1957 (30 years later), Ernst Aisenpreis mentioned only that Rudolf Steiner had first thought of placing the Group at the end of the stage (as in the first building), but then wanted to consider other possibilities. Along with fragmentary later recol -lections, there is also a contemporary, dated note by Guenther Wachsmuth about what had been decided at the time. 18 On an extended 1926 trip in Ger - many he visited Anthroposophical Soci - ety branches to describe the construc - tion progress and further plans, and to solicit financial support. In this connec - tion he also spoke about the Group and a carved wood paneling for the room that was being planned at the time; its effect 14 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 12/12 Goetheanum 19.

Alfred Hummel tried to make a pro- scenium stage compatible with a thrust stage in his 1972 essay \"Gedanken \u00fcber den Standort that Rudolf Steiner wanted the Group on the stage in the second Goetheanum, but did not make explicit reference to Aisenpre- is' April 13, 1924 note. dem Goethe anumbau geschehen, 1956, und: Was ist mit dem Goetheanumbau geschehen, Basel April 1957. See pp. 26/27 in the latter publication. The wooden back - ground for the sculpture she describes there is mistakenly attributed to an indication by Rudolf Steiner preserved in these records. As noted, this comment was made to the building authorities on August 4, 1924, but with no mention of the stage. Apparently she knew about Rudolf Steiner's intentions from other sources, as did Wachsmuth who would be \"a kind of microcosm of the first Goetheanum.\"19 The transfer to this room (called the Group Room) adjacent to the southeast wall of the stage took place on July 18, 1927 Reports about the event by Albert Steffen and Jan Stuten 20 demonstrate that the matter of whether to place the statue on the stage or in the Group Room was no longer an issue: The main point was that the work of art should stand in the Goetheanum. 21 As Albert von Baravalle (an eyewit - ness) recalled, it was Marie Steiner who gave the definitive instructions about placing the Group in its current position Steffen would have preferred to have the group on the stage, but that was not possible because of fire regulations. 22 In a moving article published in 1928, Ma - rie Steiner wrote about the old Goethea - num and the new one, and about the po - sition of the Group (which she described as a threefold form which had been left behind as a material image of the first Goetheanum). She said it was now no longer possible to provide the space the Group needed. \"Now we had to create a special room for the great sculpture.\" 23 It is impossible to say whether the danger of fire (a reason to remove it from the Carpentry Building and to avoid putting it at the rear of the stage) was the de - cisive point for the participants. In any case, it apparently seemed natural to put the Group where it stands today and we have no evidence based on statements by Rudolf Steiner or any other individu - al responsible for the placement at the time that this position might have been viewed as a provisional one. Unlike today, one entered the room at the level of the sculpture. The walls were rough, unfinished concrete like all the other interior walls of the building. In 1935\u2014after a room had been built for the urns\u2014the walls were refinished fol - lowing a design by Mieta Pyle-Waller 24 and that is how they look to this day. The architect for both projects was Albert von Baravalle.25 V. Summary of Steps until 1935 Rudolf Steiner concept of where the Group should stand in the second Goetheanum underwent change: At first he envisioned the Group on the east side of the stage (as in the first Goethea - num). During 1924 plans were made for a special room on the southeast side of the Goetheanum, and this was reflected in the architectural drawings made up to the time of Rudolf Steiner's death. The change in the drawings correlates to the development of Rudolf Steiner's view. Accordingly, the \"Group Room\" was built in the two years following his death, and the Group was placed there in 1927 . In 1935 the room was given its present form. VI. Later Developments The fact is that the three statements attributed to Rudolf Steiner show an evolution in his view, but for decades these statements were not published to - gether and discussed. They were not re - ferred to during work on the Great Hall in Doc. 5: April 20, 1925 longitudinal and cross sections of the Group room.

This publication is based on years of research and it contains a comprehensive collection of source documents that are indispensable for our understanding. The reports by Raab/ Baravalle and Estermann are highlighted in regard to the placement issue. Because of the decisive role played by the Estermann's report, the author visited him before his death. Estermann emphatically confirmed this description. Christiaan Stuten worked at the Goetheanum as an actor and director. 35. General pp. 1 and 3. Later, two statements on the June 10, 2008 decision were published, one by Erika von Baravalle, \"Erg\u00e4nzung I,\" and pp. 35-38.conversations about the placement of the Group. Instead, these conversations repre - sented varying interpretations of Rudolf Steiner's intentions about how the Sec - ond Goetheanum related to the first. If the second building had been designed with two interwoven cupolas like first, and with a stage for the Mystery Dramas, the Group would necessarily have been placed on the stage. But if Rudolf Steiner was taking a different approach with the stage\u2014more a proscenium stage, a clas - sical stage\u2014the Group would not belong there. Thus the issue was overshadowed by the polarization between these two opposing, apparently irreconcilable posi - tions: a thrust stage versus a proscenium stage. 26 For instance, during the first work on the Hall in the 1950's some planners were told about Aisenpreis' April 13, 1924 notes. These notes were read aloud in a meeting but not discussed further because the meeting was specifically about work on the Hall. 27 Later\u2014during the second phase of work on the interior of the Hall follow - ing the removal of asbestos\u2014it became clear that a technical renovation of the stage was also needed. The discussions held during the early 1990's (the plan - ning stage for the second phase of work on the Hall) can be followed in reports and articles in the newsletter and in the journal Stil. 28 There was a wide-spread lack of knowledge about Rudolf Steiner's con - cept. For example, the well known Mu -nich architect Walter Beck noted in 1992 that there was not the least indication by Rudolf Steiner about putting the group on the stage\u2014and no one disagreed (at least not publicly). 29 In his book, Rex Raab agreed with the current placement, but without reference to Rudolf Steiner's statement (published in 1982 by Ester - mann) that would have support his view. But by 1972 Raab had concluded from the 1969 interview with Albert von Bara - valle that Rudolf Steiner's opinion about the placement must have changed. He attributed this to Rudolf Steiner modi - fying his idea about a \"Mystery stage\" into more of a proscenium stage. And Raab saw this development as resulting from Rudolf Steiner's statements about speech formation and drama (Septem - ber 5-23, 1923, GA 282); these state - ments would indicate a different type of stage. According to Raab, Rudolf Steiner had seen the confrontation between actor and audience as corresponding to a soul-spiritual reality, one that could not be realized with a thrust stage. The publication also contains an extensive analysis of the architectural differences between the first and second Goethe - anums. 30 Christian Hitsch (responsible for the artistic direction of the second phase of work on the Hall) was focused on the double space he wished to shape as an interconnected whole in memory of the first Goetheanum; it was to highlight the motifs of the capitals and architraves in appropriate metamorphoses. 31 He was also moved to include the Group at the back of the stage, but he rejected the idea of doing so as an \"act of violence.\" 32 In his 1993 article on guiding principles (\"Zum Saalausbau am Goetheanum\") he called the placement question \"the most deeply intrusive into the fabric of the Goetheanum.\" It was obvious from the whole feeling of the building's concept that it was oriented toward the \"Group\" as a spiritual center. But whether it could be put on the eastern part of the stage depended on whether this was actually possible and desired based on the earlier (spiritual-physical) development of the Goetheanum. 33 Along with the explicit discussion of the stage in the publication by Rex Raab, Arne Klingborg, and \u00c5ke Fant, the Stuten is a compre - hensive source for the idea that the spir - itual-architectural concept of the second Goetheanum views the stage and place - ment of the Group differently than in the first Goetheanum. 34 This work relies on Rex Raab's discussion of Rudolf Steiner's changed concept about the function of the stage in the second building (men - tioned above), and explains why Albert von Baravalle said Marie Steiner was the decisive voice in this issue. More recently, after June 10, 2008 dis - cussions in the Collegium of the School at the Goetheanum it was decided to leave the Group where it is, but not make it impossible to put the Group on the stage when stage renovations are done. The Collegium has the documentation presented here. 35 | Uwe Werner, Dornach (Switzerland) Doc. 5: April 20, 1925 longitudinal and cross sections of the Group room.

It was held on September 21-24 at L 'Aubier in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, and was attended by twelve participants. than inflation targeting (price stability) could provide the basis for monetary policy. Through this research we began to formulate propositions to be used as a new practical foundation for economic science. [See Rudolf Steiner's fourth eco - nomics lecture, \"Division of Labor and Creation of Values\" (July 27, 1922)]. An example of this is a suggestion for money creation we worked on during the meet - ing. A work-in-progress: Money creation occurs when a request for credit (from anyone) receives a positive answer; his inner response then leads him to act as if he has money. Credit and Creativity We then looked more deeply into the significance of lending capital without collateral or providing \"personal credit\" and the empowering effects it might have on individual initiative. In contrast, collateralized lending connects human - ity too strongly with the material plane, uniting capital with the earth rather than with human creativity\u2014capital's true natural cover. While seemingly impos - sible today, it is urgently necessary for humanity to take a step away from col -lateralizing loans if it is to find stable eco - nomic ground. A second proposition on true lending arose, also a work-in-prog - ress: Once capital is there and visible as money, lend it without collateral on con - dition that the borrower meets the needs of others and has a financial plan. The third topic was the need to free the capital currently dammed up in \"land\" with only a trickle making its way to pro - vide for human needs. A part of this dam is located in a seemingly strange place, namely, in foundations, where capital comes to rest in the markets; only the in - terest on it is used each year to support research, education and new initiatives. While funding such work is highly com - mendable, the next step for foundations that will enable them to be even more effective in their mission is to spend out of their capital. If this is not done, this capital will continue to be held back and serve the interests of the capital markets rather than humanity at large. [See Ru - dolf Steiner's sixth economics lecture, \"True Price\" (July 29,1922)]. When foun - dations begin to spend out of their capi - tal, they will be moving in the direction Rudolf Steiner indicated. Our questions naturally led to looking to ourselves\u2014in the Anthroposophical Society itself\u2014and re-envisioning how its finances could be more directly based on the indications from the 1923/24 Christmas meeting. We looked at the fixed membership fee required in the statutes, although there is total freedom in how it is collected by each national So - ciety and its branches. We also looked at the problem created when one or a few individuals are responsible for managing the receipt or distribution of large dona - tions. A structure is needed to help miti - gate the self-centered tendencies that naturally arise with such decisions. We considered having associations of people or institutions manage such decisions, thus creating a surrounding awareness\u2014a periphery\u2014that would serve as a way of seeing one's own consciousness. This is an aspect that will be important in overcoming the separation of the money market from the goods market. | Jesse Os - mer, Arlesheim (Switzerland)Marc Desaules gave an overview of Rudolf Steiner's three lectures on Christian Rosenkreutz (Neuch\u00e2tel: 1911/12). Desaules used an image to illustrate the three time periods Rudolf Steiner spoke of in these lectures. The first was in the 13th century with the ap - pearance of an individual who had an ini- tiation that united all the Mysteries, and thus enabled a new culture to arise in hu - manity; it was the beginning of the Rosi - crucian Mysteries. In the second (15th century) this same individuality reincar - nated as Christian Rosenkreutz. This pe - riod is connected to the development of inner and outer observation as an instru - ment of perception and a strengthening of the Rosicrucian impulse. With the bur - geoning consciousness the Renaissance produced, humanity was increasingly pulled in opposite directions\u2014on the one hand, toward a separation from the earth represented by St. Francis of Assisi; on the other, toward too close a connec - tion to the material plane represented by Copernicus. To counter this later trend, a third event occurred at the beginning of the 17th century that brought an en - hanced capacity for peace and compas - sion to the will forces of all newly incar - nated human souls. This was how the two divergent tendencies could be held together within each human being. Marc Desaules thus provided a back - drop for the remaining three days and il - lustrated the tremendous challenge fac - ing humanity today, i.e. , how to find a true understanding of current economic phenomena as a basis for an economic science that is both theoretical and practical. The Economics Conference is a small start in this process and encour - ages involvement by anyone interested in contributing toward this task. We went on to look more closely at some of the key themes Rudolf Steiner presented in his Economics Course. These included money creation, lending without collateral, and donations. We also touched on how true pricing rather Both theoretical and practical: Developing a new science of economics "}
