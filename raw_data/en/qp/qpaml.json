After they both contracted Lyme in 2001, Vir McCoy and Kara Zahl embarked on standard antibiotic protocols. Soon they both began to have intuitive or sensory impressions about specific remedies their bodies needed, the nature of the disease, and why they were chronically ill. Backing up their intuitive impressions with scientific evidence, they developed a protocol that brought them each a full recovery after nearly 10 years battling chronic Lyme. In this medical intuitive approach to Lyme, the authors share their personal Lyme journeys and their integrative healing protocol that bridges the scientific and the spiritual. They explore the peculiarities of Lyme disease, including how Lyme is often misdiagnosed, giving it time to establish itself deep within the body's organs and nervous system, and examine in detail new and standard remedies, with thorough scientific references. They share the spiritual/psychological strategies they successfully employed against Lyme and its coinfections and explain how to increase your sensitivity to what your body is telling you to discover natural remedies and healing actions unique to your individual symptoms. Outlining a program of herbs, diet, and exercise that can work in tandem with traditional Lyme treatments, they also explore how to help the body get rid of this pathogen that possesses an incredible ability to adapt to various treatments and thwart their effectiveness. Expanding beyond Lyme, the authors offer self-help meditations to help you heal on a deeper level and explain how to access the \"holographic medicine chest\" to draw on for stronger immunity, energetic healing, and support at any time. IMPORTANT NOTE: The primary author of this book utilized various conventional and alternative treatments, though one of the most profoundly effectve treatments he experienced was from a homeopathic medicine. Please note that this is a great book but it is not an \"instruction manual\" about homeopathy and Lyme, and it provides relatively small amouts of information on homeopathic medicines. Still, this book does information on various botanical medicines, supplements, and other alternative treatments. \"This immensely practical book takes the science and art of healing Lyme disease to a totally new level. Integrating select conventional medical treatments with a variety of natural healing methods, the authors utilize meditative practices, dreamwork, and intuition as tools to determine what strategy to use when and provide specific instruction for how you too can be empowered to be healed. Equally important, the authors provide insight into the great power of intention and the greater power of love to use illness as an opportunity to learn, heal, and get physically, emotionally, and spiritually stronger than ever.\" - Dana Ullman, M.P.H., C.C.H., author of The Homeopathic Revolution and coauthor of Everybody's Guide to Homeopathic Medicines \"Vir and Kara speak many essential truths in this warm, nurturing, and valuable book. They show how balancing trust in oneself and collaboration with experienced practitioners is a seminal recipe for recovery and wellness. There is deep and ancient wisdom to be learned here, and I am grateful that they have added an indelible contribution to the spiritual science of this bourgeoning illness.\" - Steven Harris, M.D., C.E.O. and Founder of Pacific Frontier Medical, Inc.
