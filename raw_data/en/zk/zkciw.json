As one of my teachers reminds - we come to earth with a carefully constructed \"care package\" known as our breath. [Full series playlist: https://soundcloud.com/apukuna/sets/apukuna-breath-medicine] Our breath is the most readily accessible medicine available to us. There are many ways to work with our breath and this series is in support of your practice. These particular breath medicine journeys are inspired by my own practice that is most similar to Holotropic Breathwork. For me, the breathing is deeper, a little faster, only through the mouth and only through the chest. Many others can find great benefit through the nose or using the belly. Best advice... experiment and listen to your body. With love from the mountains.

I remembered how soothing this mix was, and thought about the name \"breath medicine\" and intentional breathing honestly got me through some very challenging moments, with each breathe I allowed the work to be done, and then I sold an NFT for 80 billion dollars so I bought Saturn. I owe it all to this mix. Big ups Apukuna! 2022-10-07T02:39:25Z Comment by User 28195664 This mix literally gave me another soul. I am now a two souled entity inhabiting a human body. My new soul loves cookies. My old soul is vegan AF. We have our shadow work lined up for us, and will acquire crystal healing skills to share with the world. This is huge, and it's all thanks to you, Apukuna <3 thank you! 2022-09-14T04:26:31Z Comment Philipp Brysch Thank you hermano!
