Along the way, partake in time-tested yoga and meditation practices to maximize your opportunity to receive the grace and nurturance this extraordinary place has to offer. Rooted in the desire for inner growth and fulfillment, your experience will be enhanced by the company of a small group of like-minded travelers. Key Highlights of this 14-day Excursion: Come and See for Yourself... \"Thousands of years of the spiritually charged vibrations that these mountains emit differentiates them from all the other peaks in the world. Regardless what attitude or intention you bring to these mountains, you come back with an experience of yourself and a relationship with higher reality that you have never imagined before. What that experience is and how it's received is totally different from person to person and probably cannot be put into words even by those who experience it. Simply put, come and see for yourself.\" \u2014Pandit Rajmani Tigunait \"Of all the places I have visited in my life, I have found none more fascinating than Gangotri.\" \u2014Swami Rama of the Himalayas, Living With Himalayan Masters Key Highlights Trek Trek through Gangotri National Park and follow in the footsteps of Himalayan Sages who have trod these paths for thousands of years. In these mountains, the modern world is left behind and a different reality exists. Hiking to the melody of the Ganges river just below, dramatic Himalayan peaks reveal themselves around each corner, propelling us forward through one of the most extraordinary landscapes on earth. Our trekking days are designed to satisfy experienced hikers while allowing plenty of time to reach the next destination for those desiring a slower pace. (Trek rated moderate to difficult). Practice Yoga The yoga portion of this excursion will include breath-aligned asana sequences to prepare us in the mornings for our treks, gentle asana and self-massage to help our muscles recover, and guided meditations to facilitate a deeper experience and allow us to rest in the abundance of grace that pervades this Himalayan region. Camp Moonlight shines on the snow-capped peaks and stars that seem within reach blanket the sky above. The beauty at night in the Himalayas may even eclipse what can be seen during the day. The stillness that pervades the nights offers and extraordinary time to rest, reflect, and be held in the lap of these mountains. And it's not just camping, its glamping! Enjoy the luxury of arriving to fully set-up campsites and being greeted with hot tea and a snack. Meals are always freshly prepared and delicious. The only downside is you might never want to go camping by yourself again! Like-minded Community With a maximum group size of 25 participants, take advantage of the opportunity to have meaningful experiences with others before, during, and after the excursion ends. Whether you are a seasoned yoga practitioner or simply looking to connect with something more, you'll find support in this group of like-minded individuals.
