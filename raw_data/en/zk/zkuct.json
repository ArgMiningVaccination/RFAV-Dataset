Given th is dynamic nature, it is critical to tailor economic evaluat ions of interventions targeting these diseases to the jurisdiction and timeframe in which they will be applied. The research comprising this thesis sought to address these challenges through a systematic review, population - based studies of health administr ative data , and an economic evaluation . This was implemented through the example of evaluat ing a potential pneumococcal vaccination program, with a specific focus on publicly funding the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for older adults (65+). Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram -positive bacterium that represents one of the most common causes of community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) , imposing a significant health and financial burden across the world. Due to the decline in vaccine -type pneumococcal disease among iii older adults since PCV13's inclusion in the Ontario infant immunization program, the cost - effectiveness of publicly funding PCV13 for immunocompetent older adults remains unclear . The first study was a systematic rev iew examining the impact of pneumococcal disease on health state utility values , focusing specifically on the syndromes of acute otitis media, CAP , bacteremia and meningitis . The second study was a population -based retrospective matched cohort study assess ing the incidence of disease and healthcare costs attributable to CAP from the Ontario healthcare payer perspective using health administrative data. Exposed s ubjects were found to have substantially higher healthcare costs than comparable un exposed s ubjec ts for up to one year post index date. The third study applied the data developed in the first two studies to conduct an economic evaluation of adding PCV13 to the current immunization program in Ontario. The cost-utility analysis employed a microsimulation health state transition model , with t he results indicat ing that adding PCV13 is unlikely to be cost -effective due to the substantial decline in disease caused by vaccine serotypes. Overall, this thesis demonstrates an approach to assessing the cost -effectiveness of vaccination programs, highlighting the influence of local factors such as serotype distribution on cost - effectiveness . iv Acknowledgements Throughout the journey to get to this point, I have benefited from the support of more people than I have space to name.

This is the result o f policymakers being asked to maximize health benefits with increasingly strained healthcare budgets [3,4] . The reasons for t his are multifactorial and include population growth, population aging, advances in medical technology and workforce dynamics [5]. Nevertheless, this situation has fostered a demand for ways to prioritize the most cost -effective health interventions and increase the overall efficiency of the funds allocated to healthcare. Economic evaluations provide a formal method of examining the impact of both the costs and health benefits of an intervention, giving policy makers an informed perspective on the net gain an intervention can provide [4,6] . This involves considering factors such as the price and effectiveness of the intervention as well as the healthcare costs and severity of the disease or syndro me that it is intended to treat [4,6,7] . By applying these methods to interventions across disease areas, policymakers can more easily make consistent, informed funding decisions [7,8] . Public health, wi th a particular focus on vaccin ation programs, is a field in which economic evaluation and decision -analysis models are increasingly being employed [9,10] . Vaccines are widely regarded as some of the most cost -effective interventions available in the field of medicine, primarily because they function as primary prevention at the population -level, prevent ing disease before it occurs [11,12] . Prevention is one of the fundamental principles of public health, and the introduction of vaccin ation programs to limit infectious diseases has saved millions of lives across 2 the globe [12,13] . Nevertheless, the evaluation of a vaccine poses specific challenges due to the necessity of considering the effects of the intervention at both the individual and population -level [9]. Influential factors, such as seasonal variation, vaccine -type strain prevalence and differences in vaccine uptake, can vary significantly between jurisdictions, highlight ing the importance of tailoring analyses to the local context. This thesis aims to ad dress the cost-effectiveness analysis of pneumococcal vaccination in Ontario, Canada , with a specific focus on the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) as a health technology. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a gram -positive bacterium that commonly causes infections among children, older adults and those with compromised immune systems [14- 17]. Despite the success of vaccination programs in recent years, it remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality across the world . In fact, it is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia across the world, and was estimated to have caused over 300,0 00 deaths globally among children under 5 years of age in 2015 [16]. This translates to a substantial bur den on health care systems through physician visits, hospitalizations and antibiotic prescriptions [18]. In 2010, PCV13 was incorporated into the Ontario infant immunization program with great success, leading to a significant reduction in the incidence of disease caused by vaccine -type S.pneumoniae serotypes among immunized age groups [19]. In addition to the direct effects of the vaccine, there was a simultaneous reduction in the same serotypes among non -vaccinated age groups including those older than 65 years of age [20]. This is particularly relevant as Health Canada approved an expansion of PCV13's indication to include ol der adults [21]. Despite this, PCV13 is n ot currently funded for immunocompetent older adults in any province in Canada . The only academic publication examining the cost-effectiveness of PCV13 in immunocompetent older adults in the Canadian context , which found it to be highly cost -effective, was funded by the vaccine manufacturer, Pfizer [22]. A separate 3 unpublished analysis detailed in the recent National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) report on PCV13 yielded more equivocal cost -effectiveness estimates, bringing into question the findings of the Pfizer study [23]. Given the current trends in pneumococcal serotype epidemiology, there exists significant uncertainty as to whether PCV13 would remain cost -effective for immunocompetent older adults going forward. The studies conducted in this thesis sought to produce the evidence required to conduct a n economic evaluation of PCV13 in immunocompetent older adults in Ontario , informed by context -specific primary evidence . In conducting an economic evaluation, it is necessary to synthesize different types of information [2,6] . This information can b e broadly categorized into relevant health outcomes, costing components , and the balance of intervention effectiveness and adverse effects . For S.pneumoniae vaccination, the primar y health outcomes consist of the acute impact of infection, as well as potential long -term sequelae from severe disease. R elevant costs include direct medical costs to the healthcare system based on local costing data , as well as potential societal impacts through caregiving and lost productivity . Effectiveness incorporate s the vaccine's effectiveness at preventing or limiting the disease in question , as well as the severity of the negative health consequences avoided. An aspect unique to the evaluation of vaccines is that disease risk is dynamic and the population -level effectiveness can be directly influenced by local contextual factors [9]. One illustrative example of these factors is the incidence of an infectious disease in a population , which directly affects t he number of individuals that benefit from vaccination. Given that vaccines are given to individuals when they are disease -free, the vaccine will prevent more cases in a jurisdiction where the typical incidence of disease is higher , yielding a larger cumul ative health benefit . In contrast, in jurisdictions where the disease is rare, the vaccine may only prevent a small number of cases , yielding a smaller cumulative health benefit . This is not a propert y of the vaccine itself, but 4 instead of the environment into which it is introduced - representing a unique situation that differs from drugs and devices for non -communicable diseases which are generally similarly effective regardless of local context. 1.2 Organization of The Thesis Chapter 2 provides an overview of S.pneumoniae biology and epidemiology, pneumococcal vaccination strategies and factors specific to the Canadian context. The second part of this chapter discusses the conceptual framework of health technology assessment (HTA), economic evaluations and t he challenges of conducting economic evaluations for vaccination programs . Chapter 3 is the study entitled, \" The impact of acute pneumococcal disease on health state utility values: a systematic review \". This study is a systematic review of health state utility (HSU) estimates for the acute infection phase of the four most common syndromes of pneumococcal disease : otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis. This study summarized the literature, assessed its quality and identified gaps for future research. Chapter 4 is the study entitled, \" The attributable healthcare costs and epidemiology of community - acquired pneumonia in Ontario, Canada: a population -based cohort study \". This study examined the incidenc e of infections as well as the short - and long -term costs attributable to community -acquired pneumonia from the Ontario healthcare payer perspective using health administrative data held at ICES (former ly known as the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Scien ces). The analysis used a retrospective matched cohort design and examined the costs among patients treated in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, as well as relevant subgroups. 5 Chapter 5 is the study entitled, \" The cost -utility of 13 -valent pneumoc occal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in immunocompetent older adults (65+) in Ontario, Canada, in the context of infant immunization \". This study is a cost -utility analysis examining the impact of publicly -funding PCV13 for adults 65 years and older, in additio n to currently funded 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) . The economic evaluation is based on a microsimulation health state transition model of adults 65 and older using Ontario -specific incidence and costing data. The primary outcomes assessed in the study included healthcare costs, quality -adjusted life years ( QALY ) and the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) . Costs were derived from the cost -of-illness study in Chapter 4, as well as other health administrative data sources. Chapter 6 summarizes and synthesizes the results of studies, as well as the implications for evaluations of other provincial vaccination programs, and directions for future research. 6 Chapter 2 : Background 2 Background Information & Theoretical Framework 2.1 Streptococcus pneumoniae 2.1.1 Biology is a pathogen that represents one of the largest causes of morbidity and mortality across the globe. It is a gram -positive bacterium that can be subdivided into over 90 different serotypes - defined by variations of surface antigens within a bacterial species [14]. This variability occurs in the polysaccharide capsule of S.pneumoniae , and leads to notable differences in bacterial colonisation, disease severity and the risk of death from infection. The prevalence of the various serotypes demonstrates significant regional variation , with the majority of severe illness being caused by a small subset of serotypes. Previous research has shown that S.pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx of 5 -10% of adults and 20 -40% of children, with most individuals remaining asymptomatic carriers [14]. The trigger for the transition from asymptomatic colonization to pathogenic infection is not well understood and likely multifactorial ; however , there is a significant association with previous or co -existing viral infection , such as influenza [14,17] . Transmission occurs primarily via droplets to the upper respiratory tract , with children representing the primary so urce of transmission to adults [14,17] . Among those in which the bacterial colonization becomes pathogenic, it can cause either invasive or non-invasive pneumococcal disease [14,17] . Non-invasive disease is much more common and tends to be less severe than invasive disease. Non -invasi ve infections are typically limited to the respiratory tract and the ear, leading to illnesses such as non -bacteremic pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis and otitis media. In contrast, invasive pneumococcal disease refers to cases where the 7 bacter ia invades a normally sterile site, such as the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. This can lead to the development of severe conditions such as meningitis, sepsis and septic arthritis. Notably, these infections can cause patients to suffer from both acute and long-term sequelae such as hearing loss, neurological disabilities and adverse cardiovascular events. 2.1.2 Epidemiology and Burden of Pneumococcal Disease Despite the success of pneumococcal vaccination programs, S.pneumoniae remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality across the world [15,16] . In most regions, S.pneumoniae represents the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia, resulting in substantial health burden and healthcare costs due to hospitalizations an d physician visits [14,24,25] . As with many infectious d iseases, the incidence of disease is greatest at the extremes of age and among immunocompromised patients. Adults older than 65 years of age are particularly vulnerable to infection and severe disease due to immunosenescence and the prevalence of chronic c o-morbidities. S.pneumoniae is particularly relevant for Ontario health policymakers as the Ontario Burden of Infectious Disease Study (ONBOIDS) ranked it as the second most burdensome pathogen in the province in terms of the years and quality of life lost to infection - above human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) , Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli [26]. The study estimated that each year S.pneumoniae was responsible for 6 ,669 years of life lost to premature mortality , as well as 1 ,601 year-equivalents of reduced functioning, representing the years of healthy life lost due to poor health states associated with infection and disease . The pneumococcal s yndrome associated with the greatest cumulative population health burden is pneumonia. Although the mortality rate of pneumonia is not as high a s that of meningitis or sepsis, 8 its incidence is markedly larger , leading to a greater number of cumulative hospitalizations and deaths . Despite the fact that it has been identified as a n occasional source of hospital -acquired infection s, S.pneumoniae is primarily considered as an important cause of community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) [14]. In Canada, CAP remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality ; when considered together , influenza and pneumonia represent ed the sixth most common cause of death in Canada in 2017 [15,27] . However, t he severity of CAP can vary substantially between cases, with the majority of episodes only requiring care in the outpatient setting [28]. The overall incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations in Canada ranged from 611 per 100,000 in those under five years of age to 3,002 per 100,000 in those over the age of 80 years [29]. Notably, t here is considerable variation in incidence rates between provinc es, with Ontario having the lowest overall incidence across the country [29]. Prior to widespread vaccination, S.pneumoniae was traditionally considered to be the most common etiologic pathogen for CAP. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that in bot h children and adults the etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization is mo st often viral. In the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) studies , conducted in three American hospitals over the course of nearly three years , S.pneumoniae was isolated fr om approximately 4% of cases among children, and 5% of cases among adults [24,25] . The most commonly isolated pathogens were found to be respiratory syncytial virus (28%) among children, and human rhinovirus (9%) among adults. It is important to note that the studies reported a substantial number of cases where no pathogen was identified. This occurred in 19% of cases in children, and 62% of cases in adults. In the Canadia n context, the highest quality data on the etiology of CAP comes from the Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network of the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) 9 which has initiated active CAP surveillance since 2010 in nine hospitals across five Canadian provinces. The most recent data from the years 2014 -2015 indicated that S.pneumoniae was isolated from approximately 10% of CAP admissions , indicating the presence of a substantial residual burden of disease despite the success of infant immunization programs [30,31] . With regard to the economic burden of disease, a small number of studie s have attempted to quantify the burden of S.pneumoniae or its syndromes in Canada [32-37]. The most recent study to focus on healthcare cost attributable to S.pneumoniae was published in 2007, and applied hospitalization data and assumptio ns about expected healthcare utilization to Canadian age -specific incidence rates of acute otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis [32]. The analysis indicated an annual burden of 155 -255 million CAD per year in terms of direct healthcare cost s attributable to S.pneumoniae , driven mainly by hospitalized pneumonia . However, most of the economic analyses have focused on the syndromes caused by S.pneumoniae . In a recent study from 2017 examining the impact of infant immunization programs in Ontario, the authors found that all -cause pneumonia hospitalizations accounted for an average annual cost of $205.7 million CAD from 1992 -2014 [36]. A separate 2017 study from the C onference Board of Canada focused on adults aged 65 years and older, estimat ing that the burden of all-cause hospitalized pneumonia for this age group was $275 million CAD in 2014 across Canada [35]. These analysis combined province -specific incidence and cost-per-case data from hospital administrative datasets. Other Canadian studies have estimated costs per case r anging from $1,836 to $ 10,233 [32-34,37] . To date, studies examining cost s related to S.pneumoniae have focused primarily on hospitalization costs, with most of these analyses having been conducted more than 10 years ago. In fact, it has been relatively rare for studies to attempt to incorporat e outpatient costs , or the impact of disease sequelae after the acute phase of illness. At 10 present, t he only examples of Canadian outpatient costing analyses for S.pneumoniae syndromes have been for otitis media [38-40]. 2.1.3 Serotype Although there are over 90 serotypes of S.pneumoniae , only a relatively small proportion are implicated in the overall disease burde n [14]. Research has indicated that differences in the polysaccharide capsule likely have a direct impact on the observed prevalence and pathogenicity of the different sero types. This is due in part to the fact that certain serotypes are more resistant to opsonization and other immune system responses, facilitating their colonization and pro liferation . In Ontario, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is a reportable disease and as such, cultured isolates are sent to the Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) for serotyping. This passive surveillance facilitates annual tracking of not only the incidence of IPD as a whole , but the serotypes most prevalent in the region [20,41] . Reportable disease data often represents an underestimate of the total disease burden and typically skews towards more severe cases, as patients with milder symptoms that resolve qu ickly are less likely to have cultures drawn for analysis . Other networks such as the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Disease Network (TIBDN) conduct active surveillance in a smaller geographical area , providing an opportunity for cross -referencing and the detection of more local patterns of disease [19]. Comprehensive s erotype data for non -invasive disease is more difficult to obtain, owing to the fact that culturing samples is not usually part of routine practice with the exception of the most severe or prolonged cases. However, targeted projects such as a study of pneumonia by TIBDN and the SOS Network's examination of CAP etiology have provided valuab le insight into the serotype distribution 11 for non -invasive disease [30,31,42,43] . However, these projects are more short -lived or limited geographically, so there remains a dearth of long -term population -based data for these outcomes. Despite these limitations, these datasets have made it possible to observe significant changes in the serotype distribution of S.pneumoniae over time. Notably, the introduction of vaccines such as the 7 - valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has had a marked impact on disease epidemiology. Namely, once PCV7 became publicly funded as a part of the infant immunization program in Ontario , there was significant decrease in the rates of IPD caused by the seven vaccine serotypes [19]. Importantly, this effect was also seen among unvaccinated age group s, demonstrating the significant impact of the herd immunity effects via decreased transmission from infants to other population groups. This impact has been replicated in many other jurisdictions across the globe, highlighting its reproducibility [44]. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of serotype replacement has been shown to blunt the projected effectiveness of these vaccines [20,44,45] . This effect refers to the increase d incidence of non- vaccine serotypes observed after the introduction of a vaccine to a population. Research across a number of jurisdictions has shown that while there is typically near comple te serotype replacement in terms of pathogen carriage, there is often only partial serotype replacement in terms of disease burden [45]. This may be due to the vaccine s eliminating the carr iage of more pathogenic serotypes, which are then replaced by serotypes less likely to cause disease. The degree to which this has occurred appears to vary from region to region, with some jurisdictions experiencing minimal serotype replacement, and others experiencing more dramatic replacement, resulting in only minimal decreases in the overall incidence of disease [46]. The exact reasons for these observed differences are unclear given the variability across jurisdictions , but proposals for important factors include 12 sampling methodologies ( e.g., only inpatient vs inpatient and ambulatory), vaccine schedules, contact patterns, demographics and the initial prevalence of specific serotypes [46]. In Ontario, there was a notable decline in total IPD incidence after the authorization of PCV7 in 2001, when the vaccine became available for private purcha se prior to the introduction of the publicly funded infant immunization program in 2005 [19]. However, the decline in total IPD incidence across other age groups was less marked, and since 2007, there has been signifi cant serotype replacement after the introduction of both PCV10 and PCV13, with declines in vaccine serotypes being nearly completely offset by increasing incidence of non -vaccine serotypes . 2.1.4 Pneumococcal Vaccines and Programs in Ontario and Canada Given t he significant morbidity and mortality attributable to S.pneumoniae , substantial funding has been allocated to mitigation strategies, namely prevention through vaccination. Two types of vaccines targeting S. pneumoniae have been developed : the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and the PPV23 incorpora te purified polysaccharide capsules of the specified strains to act as antigens for immune cells. This exposure primes the immune system for defense against infection by S.pneumoniae bacteria displaying these serotypes. PPV23 was first funded in Ontario for adults over the age of 65 years in 1995 [19]. However, the immune response to PPV23 is T -cell independent, meaning that B cells can produce antibodies against the antigens without the help of T -cells [47]. This is an important limitation, as T -cell independent responses are 13 inadequate to elicit significant antibody production and thereby promote lasting immunity among young children (<2 years of age) whose immune systems are still developing. Given that young children are more susceptible to pneumococcal infections, this represented a substantial drawback of exclusive PPV23 vaccination programs. As a result, the original 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was developed, representing a novel mechanism of action to induce immunologic responses in children. Unlik e PPV23, the polysaccharide capsules included in the vaccine are attached to a protein, specifically a diphtheria carrier protein [47]. This conjugated protein is thereby able to trigger a T -cell dependent response in young children and establish a lasting immunity against the strains included in PCV7 (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F). Based on this strong immunologic response, PCV7 was introduced as part of Ontario's publicly -funded routine infant immunization program in 200 5 [19]. PCV7 was subsequently updated to 10 -valent v accine (PCV10 - additional serotypes: 1, 5, 7F) in 2009 , and the current 13 -valent vaccine (PCV13 - additional serotypes: 1, 5, 7F, 3, 6A, 19A) in 2010. In recent years there has been debate over the effectiveness of PPV23 in adults , particularly against non-invasive pneumococcal disease such as pneumonia [48]. As such, there have been suggestions that the newer PCV 13 may be a superior option for adults despite covering fewer serotypes, with some recent evidence supporting this notion. PCV13 is currently funded for high -risk immunocompromised adults in Ontario [20,41] . Given the recent strong results of the large -scale Community -Acqu ired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA), there has been growing support for funding PCV13 for all adults 65 years and older in addition to, or instead of PPV23 [49]. In Canada, vaccine recommendations are made by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), a collaboration of experts in the fields of infectious diseases, immunology, 14 epidemiology, health economics, and public heal th [50]. The purpose of the group is to provide ongoing a nd timely public health advice, publish ing recommendations to the provinces and territories concerning the funding and implementation of vaccination programs . The vaccines considered are those already approved by Health Canada , which assesses the balance o f clinical outcomes and manufacturing quality , ensuring that the population is not exposed to vaccines demonstrating more harm than benefit [51]. NACI's recommendations take a broader view , considering effectiveness , safety and economic factors , as well as ethics, equity, feasibility and acceptability (EEFA) [52]. This facilitates the systematic consideration of factors critical to the successful implementation of publicly -funded vaccination programs in a sustainable and equitable manner. However, it is important to note that these recommendations are not binding, and alt hough most provinces and territories make similar decisions, there remain discrepancies in programs between regions . In recent years, NACI has made distinctions between two categories of recommendations in their statements: individual -level (based on effec tiveness and safety) and population -level recommendations (based on effectiveness, safety and programmatic factors, including EEFA and economics). In the most recent NACI recommendation on pneumococcal vaccines published in 2018, the committee updated the ir previous interim recommendation from 2016 on PCV13 in immunocompetent adults 65 years of age and older [23,53] . In their 2016 recommendation , NACI indicated that: \"there is good evidence, on an individual basis, to recommend in immunocompetent adults aged 65 years and older not previously immunized against pneumococcal disease, the use of PNEU -C-13 vaccine followed by PNEU -P-23, for the prevention of CAP and IPD caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the conjugate vaccine.\" [53] 15 The evidence supporting this individual -level recommendation was derived primarily from the CAPITA trial, which consisted of more than 80,000 patients aged 65 years and older from the Netherlands, comparing PCV13 to placebo, with a mean follow -up time of 4 years [49]. The trial demonstrated clear efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine -type CAP and IPD, reporting risk reductions of 45% and 75% respectively for each of the primary outcomes. In the same 2016 statement, NACI indicated that despite this evidence of clinical benefit, the population -level impact of funding a routine vaccination program for older adults \"remained unclear\" given that it would be highly dependent on the incidence of serotypes covered by the vaccine [53]. As a result, the population - level recommendation was deferred until the updated 2018 statement which indicated that : \"NACI recommends that PNEU -P-23 vaccine should be offered in routine immunization programs for all adults age 65 years and older for the prevention of IPD (Strong NACI reco mmendation)... NACI recommends that PNEU -C-13 vaccine should not be publicly funded in routine immunization programs for adults 65 years of age and older without other risk factors increasing their risk of IPD (Strong NACI recommendation), unless PNEU -C-13 price decreases\" [23] This updated recommendation , which considered work from this thesis, was justified by highlighting the significant decline in PCV13 serotypes causing disease among older adults since the introducti on of the infant immunization program. The indirect (herd) effects attributable to the infant immunization has resulted in vaccine serotypes representing an increasingly small proportion of the overall S.pneumoniae burden. As a result, according to NACI's analysis, the price of the vaccine would need to be significantly reduced for its routine use to be considered cost -effective. 16 Table 2.1 Overvie w of pneumococcal vaccine funding policies across Canada [54,55].

This analysis was funded by the vaccine manufacture r Pfizer, and to this point there has not been a nother published analysis examining this specific question. That said , the serotype distribution changes observed after the introduction of PCV7 demonstrated that the herd effects steadily increase d over tim e, and as a result there may have been further decreases in PCV13 serotypes among the older adult population since this analysis was published [19]. At present, PCV13 is publicly funded and incorporated int o the routine infant immunization schedules of all provinces and territories, with the exception of Quebec which has continued to use PCV10 (Table 2 -1) [54,55] . In regards to public funding for adult vaccination, PPV23 is funded across the country for adults 65 years of age and older, or for younger individuals with high -risk conditions or residence in a care facility. The primary variation in coverage of PPV23 for adults are the conditions considered high -risk, and the exception of Nunavut which funds the vaccine for all adults 50 years and older. Finally, funding for PCV13 among adults is limited in all provinces to high-risk groups with the e xception of Nunavut where it is not funded for any group. The high -risk indications for PCV13 are generally more limited than those for PPV23, and there is no province at this time that funds PCV13 for immunocompetent adults. 2.2 Conceptual Framework 2.2.1 Health Technology Assessment The fundamental challenge in publicly funded healthcare systems is the difficulty in allocating scarce resources to maximize the health gains for the population [3,56] . With certain exceptions, these 18 systems provid e care to all residents regardless of their ability to pay ; however , funds are limited by the budgets of provincial or territorial governments. As such, it is not possible to simply cover all available interventions for every condition. This necessitates i mportant resource allocation decisions, which have become increasingly challenging as the complexity of medical care has increased and the cost of care has dramatically accelerated [5]. With increasing cost pressures, it has become apparent that in order to achieve the goal of providing the best possible care for patients , it is critical to not only understand the epidemiology and cli nical aspects of diseases, but also their financial implications [6,57] . Name ly, decision makers wi thin the health system must decide where to allocate resources ( i.e. by disease area , hospitals, primary care , public health ) and how to maximize the health benefit achieved from the use of those resources (i.e. what interventions should be funded ), while striving to maintain principles of equity and justice [6,57,58] . Given funding constraints , each intervention that is implemented is associated with an opportunity cost, representing resources th at could otherwise be allocated els ewhere [6,7,57,58] . In this way, funding an intervention that is overly expensive, misused or ineffective can be detrimental to population health as it represents financing that may have otherwise been used more efficiently. For instance, instead of adding a new oral antidiabetic drug to the provinc ial formulary of drugs funded by the government, the same funding could have been used to expand the age group of women eligible for biannual mammography screening for breast cancer. Evidently, it is important to consider the value of each intervention and program in terms of the health gain achieved for the funds invested. More recently, there has been a shift to improving consideration of where these health gains are concentrated [59]. For instance, certain programs may only benefit those with the means and time available to access them, effectively excluding a proportion of the population. This is most concerning in situations where marginalized groups, who already face many challenges in receiving 19 optimal healthcare, benefit the least from an intervention. These critical h ealth policy decisions are best made wh en informed by high -quality evidence, and as a result there has been a concerted effort in the past few decades to address this need through research. In particular, many jurisdictions now regularly employ health technology assessment (HTA) to address the potential effects and impacts of a new health technology in comparison with the current standard of care available to patients [4,7,60] . HTA is a multidisciplinary practice that involves synthesizing evidence on the medical, economic, social, ethical and legal implications of a new health technology ( e.g., novel drug, diag nostic test) for the purposes of informing health policy decisions [10,60] . These decisions can be those made at the provincial or national level such as drug formulary coverage, or more local decisions such as those made within individua l hospitals. Regardless of the scope, HTA serves to utilize the best available evidence and methodological techniques to evaluate the risks, benefits and costs of a technology that is being considered for funding, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the se factors. HTA encompasses three paradigms with related, but distinct perspectives: evidence -based medicine, economic evaluation & social science/bioethics [61,62] . The paradigm of evidence -based medicine (EBM) focuses primarily on health outcomes and has been classically defined as the \"conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care individual patients\" [63]. In contrast, economic evaluation adopts a focus on the economic aspects of a health technology, and consists of undertaking comparative Health Technology Assessment Evidence - Based Medicine Economic Evaluation Ethical, Legal & Social Issues (ELSI) Figure 2-1 Overview of the paradigms of health technology assessment - based on [62] 20 analyses of the costs and consequences (e.g. , health gains) of alternative health technologies. This can extend to assessing feasibility through budget -impact analyses, which estimate the financial costs of a technology in absolute terms, as opposed to efficiency. Finally, the paradigms of social science and bioethics centre more clearly on the social, ethical and legal implications of a health technology. Inevitably this involves a number of value judgements that may differ by indiv idual or region. As a result, there is an emphasis on establishing a \"fair process\" to consider these factors and allow decision -makers to agree on what is equitable and appropriate. This thesis will primarily attempt to address the economic aspects of the assessment of PCV 13 as a health technology in the Ontario context . An aspect unique to vaccination programs and vaccines as interventions is that their effectiveness is influenced by environmental factors [9]. For instance, the incidence of an infectious disease in a population (disease risk) has a substantial impact on the number of individuals that receive benefit from vaccination. Given that population -based programs administer vaccines to individuals when they are disease -free, more cases will be prevented in a jurisdiction wher e disease incidence is higher. In contrast, in a jurisdiction where the disease is rare, the vaccine may only prevent a small number of cases , despite the per capita cost of implementing the program being the same . This is not a property of the vaccine itself, but instead of the environment into which it is introduced. This represents a unique situation that is different from most other treatment interventions which are similarly effective regardless of how prevale nt the disease is within a population. Another environmental factor to consider that is more specific to S.pneumoniae is the distribution of serotypes causing disease, as the most prevalen t serotypes can vary from region to region [64]. Given that the pneumococcal vaccines only cover a select number of serotypes, this can impact observed overall effectiveness. Specifically, this would manifest as increased 21 effectiveness in a region where the most common serotypes causing infection are those covered by the vaccine , and reduced effectiveness in a region with low levels of vaccine serotypes. 2.2.2 Economic Evaluation Economic evaluations serve the purpose of informing decisions between different options, whether they be medical interventions, preventive measures, screening programs, or diagnostic tests [4,7,65] . To provide value, these analyses must specify the perspective and time horizon of the analysis, the interventions being compared and the outcomes of interest. The practice of using economic evaluations in health was adopted from the broader field of economics, where similar methods are employed to identify the \"social optimum\", refe rring to the point at which the marginal benefits are equivalent to the marginal costs [66]. However, health is unique relative to most goods and services, due to the significant asymmetry of information in the market, restricted choice in public systems and considerable uncertainty in terms of need and benefit [67-69]. Nevertheless, the overarching goal of applying economic evaluations to health decisions remains similar: optimizing the efficiency of resource use in terms of the benefit gained per dollar spent. Evaluations reveal normative perceptions of val ue by deciding what i s measured and assessed . In practice, this is operationalized by the outcomes chosen in a given analysis, and which of these we are trying to maximiz e. Economic evaluations of health care interventions have historically adopted approac hes underpinned by two one of the foundations of welfare economics, which dictates that optimal decisions are those that maximize the utilities attained by affected individuals [2,56] . Utility is an economic concept that is a quantified representation of an individual's preferences ; implicitly 22 reflecting the satisfaction that an individual receives from the results of their choices, typically in terms of goods and services acquired or accessed . In contrast, at its most basic, extra -welfarism stipulates that optimal decisions should be based on a wider set of information than utilities [2,56] . This perspective was developed in opposition to the dominant paradigm of welfarism within the field of economics, and at present, there is no si ngle prescriptive \"extra -welfarist\" approach to evaluation. However, some common principles have evolved over time in the application of extra -welfarism in health economics. Most important among these is the predominant focus on health as the main outcome of interest, as opposed to utility [56,70] . In welfaris t approaches , utility is typically operationalized using willingness -to-pay (WTP) approaches, which value health outcomes in monetary units so that decision -makers can assess whether the val ue of the benefits exceeds the value of the costs. This practice of det ermining monetary values is challenging and subject to a number of distortions, the most prominent of which is the fact that the socioeconomic status of respondents plays a significant role in the values assigned to outcomes [2,56] . Extra -welfarist approaches tend to focus on health as the outcomes due the fact that health is observable and within certain limits, valued comparably between m embers of society. A criticism of this approach is that in practice, many extra -welfaris t analyses have simply switched one outcome with significant limitations (utility), with another outcome (health ) that has its own limitations [56]. The view of extra -welfarists is that the advantages of this approach are superior due to the unique nature of health as a good, the flexibility of this approach to address equity concerns thr ough weighting, and the aversion of healthcare decision -makers to directly assign monetary values to health outcomes such as lives saved. The other important distinction between the two approaches is th at welfarism is based on the notion that individuals a re the best and only judge of their own welfare and utility , and therefore only utilities derived from affected individuals are relevant in evaluation [56]. Extra -welfarist analyses 23 focus on taking the perspective of the broader society, and can draw upon valuations from the general public, thereby including values derived from individuals unaffected by a given decision [2,56] . In practice, this is often accomplished by surveying members of the general publi c about the health -related quality of life associated with specific health states. There are several types of economic evaluations , with the primary difference between them being how the benefits of an intervention are valued. These include cost -benefit a nalysis (CBA), cost - effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost -utility analysis (CUA) and cost -minimization analysis (CMA) [2,4,7,65] . Traditionally, CBAs have been considered welfarist analyses, while CEA and CUA have been associated with extra -welfarist perspectives . Welfarist CEAs and non -welfarist CBAs are technically possible, however have been extremely rarely implemented in the literature to date [70]. CMAs are the simplest type of evaluation, as they invoke an assumption that the cumulative health benefits of the interventions being compared are entirely equivalent, and therefore the only differences between interventions are the cumulative costs of each strategy. This type of analysis has fallen out of favour due to the implausibility of two treatments being identical in both effectiveness and safety, as well as the lack of consideration for estimate uncertainty [72]. CBA is the most similar to non-health economic analyses, as it is the most aligned with welfarist economic theory. These analyses measure benefit in monetary terms, requiring the researcher to convert all health outcomes to this format. As mentioned, t his is a challenging process but can be done through a number of different methods that elicit a WTP estimate , including contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments. However, CBAs are rarely employed to evaluate health interventions in Canada due to the fact that valuing health outcomes is not only technically difficult, but brings up a number of ethical concerns as the valuation process is generally drive n by WTP experiments [65,73] . 24 CEAs are distinct from CBAs in that they measure benefits in terms of specified clinical outcomes such as hospitalizations, cases of illness, lives saved or life -years saved. In this way, cost - effectiveness is expressed as the cost per health outcome achieved. For instance, if a new intervention prevents 10 additional cases of an illness and costs $10,000 more than its comparator, the result of the analysis would indicate that the intervention cost $1,000 per case avoided. While this avoids the challenge of assigning a monetary value to an outcome, it limits the ability to compare interventions affecting different outcomes - a feature that is highly valued when making decisions across a health s ystem [2,65] . For example, consider two interventions: (1) palivizumab for pre -term infants, which is associated with an incremental cost of $12,000 per hospitalization averted , and (2) increased follow -ups at an anticoagulation clinic for patients on chronic warfarin therapy, which is associated with an incremental cost of $31,327 per thrombotic or hemorrhagic event averted [74,75] . A decision between funding one intervention or the other would remain quite chall enging and involve substantial degree of personal judgement by decision -makers . The most common type of analysis employed for health decision -making in Canada is the cost-utility analysi s (CUA) , as recommended by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) economic evaluation guidelines [65]. These analyses evaluate interventions through the use of quality -adjusted life years (QALY), a metric that factors in both the quantity and the quality of life gained by funding an intervention [2]. This is achieved by adjusting life expectancy using health state utility (HSU) estimates ; a value from 0 -1 that represents a proxy for health -related quali ty of life in a given health state ( e.g., hospitalized with pneumonia, confined to a wheelchair, managing stage 4 lung cancer) . Traditionally, a value of 1 represents perfect health, while a value of 0 represents death . Some analyses also consider negative HSU values for health states considered \"worse than death\". HSU estimates can be determined for different health states using a number of 25 scales and instruments that assess individuals' preferences for health states ( e.g., preference between living 10 extra years with a severe disease or 2 extra years in full health) [56]. These can generally be divided into direct and indirect methods ; where indirect methods are accessible, convenient instruments that use the direct methods as their foundation. The most commonly employed direct methods are the standard gamble, the time trade -off and the numerical rating scale [2,56] . Each of these methods uses a slightly different approach to directly establish a HSU estimate for a specified health state. Indirect instruments are a broad group questionnaires, including the EQ -5D, SF -6D and Health Utilities Index, that are administered to affected individuals, and use a scoring formula to derive a HSU value based on the sp ecified series of responses [56]. The scoring formula for each indire ct instrument that is used to convert the respondent's answers to a HSU value is based on one of the direct methods ; facilitating the conversion of respondents' answers to general health questions into a single numerical value representing their estimated health -related quality of life (HRQoL) . The primary advantage of these methods is that they are generic and easy to administer, thereby allowing them to be included in the study of various health conditions without excessive investment or patient burden . However, given that the questionnaires are intentionally brief and broad, they can lack the sensitivity to detect certain changes in health states. Although CUAs are a prominent example of the extra -welfarist approach to evaluations, extra -welfarist analyse s do not completely reject the use of utility -based methods that elicit preferences, such as the standard gamble [56]. Instead, these analyses often incorporate this information in ways not fully consistent with the welfar ist perspective, as the purpose of these methods remains focused on estimating health and not utility. Accounting for HRQoL is significant as the gains in quality of life provided by an intervention can be as important as the gains in quantity of life. Through the use of QALYs , both aspects are captured. QALYs are particularly useful for healthcare decisio n-makers as they allow for comparisons across 26 disease states [2,56] . By creating a common health outcome metric such as the QALY, health decision -makers can more easily make choices between interventions across therapeutic areas. Once the QALYs and costs are calculated based on the chosen model, the results of a CUA are expressed as an incremental cost -utility ratio (ICUR/ICER) of the cost per QALY gained provided by the new intervention. In cases where more than two interventions are compared, the net monetary benefit (NMB) or net health benefit (NHB) can be employed to facilitate the interpretation of results [2,56,76,77] . These measures represent a rearrangement of the standard cost -effectiveness decision rule, wher e the ratio of incremental costs (C) over incremental benefits (E) is targeted to be less than the specified cost-effectiveness threshold (). NMB is a summary measure that converts outcomes into monetary units based on the prespecified cost -effectivenes s threshold. It is calculated by multiplying the incremental effectiveness of an intervention (e.g. , 10 QALYs) by the specified cost -effectiveness threshold (e.g., $50,000/QALY), and subtracting the incremental costs associated with that intervention (NMB= [*E] - C). The NHB is similar, but instead converts the intervention's costs to the desired health outcomes (e.g. , QALYs) based on the cost -effectiveness threshold. It is derived by dividing the costs of an intervention (e.g. , $100,00 0) by the c ost-effectiveness threshold (e.g., $50,000/QALY), and subtracting th at value from the health benefits associated with th e intervention (NHB= E - [C/]) . Positive NMB and NHB values indicate that the intervention falls below the specified cost-effectiveness threshold, while negative values indicate interventions costing more than the threshold . When comparing multiple strategies, they can be effectively ranked in order of NMB or NHB to provide a simple framework for interpretation . In addition , this method ha s the advantage of avoiding the statistical issues brought about by working with a ratio statistic such as the ICER [2,76,77] . Interpret ation of an ICER is limited by the ambiguity of the value in isolation; for instance, 27 a negative ICER can either represent a treatment with higher benefits and lower costs, or lower benefits and higher costs. This brings about challenges when constructing confidence intervals, although methods to address this have been developed over time. The linear nature of NMB and NHB is also beneficial as it facilitates the inclusion of covariates in a regression analysis, which can be of particular value for analyses conducted alongside clinical trials. Nevertheless, it does require analysts to pre -specify willingness -to-pay values for calculation, which are not explicitly defined in Canada and can vary between therapeutic areas [78,79] . 2.2.3 Cost -of-Illness Analyses The types of economic evaluations described so far are referred to as \"full\" economic evaluations as they assess both the costs and benefits of two or more alternative interventions or strategies [2]. While full economic evaluations focus primarily on efficiency, \" efficiency is about how we should allocate our resources to achieve our goals, not what our goals should be \" [80], \"partial\" economic evaluations such as cost -of-illness (COI) analyses address the relative burden of diseases in terms of health outcomes and economic burden [81-83]. COI studies are descriptive , assess ing the economic burden of disease at the individual and/or systems level, while identifying the main cost drivers behind this impact [81-83]. Employed by many organizations to inform strategic health plannin g, they often lay the groundwork for future full economic evaluations . COI analyses can be conducted in a number of ways, with an important distinction being drawn between incidence -based and prevalence -based approaches. Prevalence -based approaches examin e disease costs for all patients with a condition ( e.g., breast cancer), or subset of a condition ( e.g., stage 4 breast cancer), during a cross section of time. In this way, one can quantify the total burden of a disease at that time point. H owever , this m ethod has the drawback of less granularity and difficulty 28 defining costs for patients over the course of their illness. In contrast, incidence -based approaches evaluate the costs among new cases of disease over time after diagnosis, often to a particular p oint in time ( e.g., discharge from hospital, 1 year after diagnosis, death). Incidence -based COI analyses are therefore particularly relevant for economic evaluations of interventions aimed at prevention . The challenge with this approach is usually related to a lack of data, whether that be from loss to follow - up or datasets that do not allow for analyses at the patient -level. These limitations have been mitigated in recent years with the emerging availability of large administrative datasets, as well as t he development of costing methods to account for baseline healthcare use, censoring and loss to follow -up [84-88]. Furthermore, these large datasets allow for population -based studies which reduces the selection bias that is often inherent in other observational datasets. The primary disadvantage of these datasets is that due to the fact that they were historically developed for billing purposes and not research, there are limitations to the accuracy of the data . Since most studies rely on diagnostic codes based on th e International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system, the most commonly encountered issue is misclassification bias [89,90] . This refers to the effect where individuals that should be assigned to one group are inadvertently assigned to another. This arises primarily due to errors and differences in billing or coding practices , potentially leading affected individuals to be classified as not having the disease, and vice -versa. Nevertheless, the advantag es offered by these datasets often outweigh their limitations and various analytic approaches and sensitivity analyses have been used to attempt to mitigate these effects. Another distinction that can be drawn between COI methodologies is the top -down vs. bottom -up approach [83]. The bottom -up approach involves estimating costs at the individual level and averaging values across the considered group. These average costs can then be extrapolated to the 29 larger population with the given exposure. In contrast, top -down a pproaches use aggregate costs from the population of interest, and typically allocate a proportion of these costs to the exposure of interest by using an estimate of the individuals affected by the exposure. Prevalence -based COI studies can use either appr oach, while incidence -based costs are generally more limited to bottom -up approach. 2.3 Research Questions and Rationale 2.3.1 Study 1 What is known about the impact of S.pneumoniae and pneumococcal syndromes on health -related quality of life (HRQoL) among infected patients? Estimates of HRQoL using HSU values are important for valuing health burden in terms of QALYs [2]. HRQoL is critical to accurately characterize the severity of illnes s among infected patients, and the potential gain accrued by avoiding infection. Among the economic evaluations of pneumococcal vaccines performed to date, those that conducted a CUA have employed a wide range of HSU estimates with little consistency betwe en studies [91-93]. The value s that have been consistently used in these analyses are now dated, and therefore it is unclear if this variability in choice of H SU estimates has been necessitated by a lack of available data. Although reviews on HRQoL among patients with histories of oti tis media, sepsis and community -acquired pneumonia have previously been published, most of these reports did not capture the impact of disease during the acute phase of infection, or exclusively included studies that used instruments incompatible with deri ving the global HSU scores required for QALY calculations [94-96]. 30 2.3.2 Study 2 What are the healthcare costs attributable to community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) for outpatient and inpatient treatment in Ontario , Canada ? Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with S.pneumoniae, aspects of the economic burden of this pathogen in Ontario remain poorly understood. While there has been a wealth of research conducted on various clinical aspe cts of S.pneumoniae infections, there is a paucity of high -quality data on the healthcare costs associated with infection. Given that pneumococcal CAP represents the vast majority of the cumulative health burden imposed by S.pneumoniae , this study aimed to characterize the COI of this syndrome. To date, analyses of the economic burden of CAP have been limited to hospitalization costs, have not estimated long -term attributable costs, or are based on estimates from other jurisdictions with different healthcar e funding structure s that may not be reflective of those present in Ontario [32-37]. By taking advantage of the wealth of health administrative data available in Ontario , this analysis will comprehensively describe the epidemiological burden and healthcare costs attributable to CAP in Ontario. 2.3.3 Study 3 What is the optimal pneumococcal vaccination funding strategy for adults 65 years of age and older in Ontario , Canada from the perspective of the Ministry of Health? The pneumococcal vaccine currently funded for older adults in Ontario is PPV23 , which was introduced i n 1995 [19]. However , in recent years there has been debate over its eff ectiveness , particularly against non -invasive pneumococcal disease such as CAP [48]. As a result, combined with the demonstrated efficacy of PCV13 against CAP and IPD seen in the CAPITA trial, there have been suggestions that funding PCV13 in addition to PPV23 may be a su perior option. Despite 31 protecting against fewer strains of S.pneumoniae than PPV23, PCV13 is thought to elicit a greater immune response to strains contained in the vaccine [47]. Despite this, PCV13 is not currently funded for immunocompetent adults in any Canadian province and the cost-effectiveness in this population has only been assessed in one published analysis funded by the vaccine manufacturer [22]. This analysis was published in 2018 and found the vaccine to be highly cost -effective. However, due to the fact that this assessment focused on all of Canada, ignoring the differences in between provinces, as we ll as the ongoing downward trend of PCV13 serotypes, there remains value in exploring its cost -effectiveness in the current Ontario context. 32 Chapter 3 : Study 1 3 The impact of acute pneumococcal disease on health state utility values: a systematic review Published as: O'Reilly, Ryan, Sayako Yokoyama, Justin Boyle, Jeffrey McGeer, and Beate Sander. \"The impact of acute pneumococcal disease on health state utility values: a systematic review.\" Quality of Life Research (2021): 1 -14. 33 3.1 Abstract Objective: Streptococcus pneumoniae infections remain a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The purpose of this review was to summarize the impact of pneumococcal disease on health state utilities (HSU) in the acute phase of illness. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, the Health Technology Assessment Database, the National Health Economic Evaluation Database, and Tufts Cost -Effectiveness Registry (up to January 2020 ) for primary studies. Eligible studies elicited HSU estimates using preference -based instruments for the acute phase of infection of pneumococcal syndromes including acute otitis media, pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infections, bacteremia/sepsis, and meningitis. Two reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction and quality appraisal. Results: We screened 10,178 studies, of which 26 met our inclusion criteria. Cohort sizes ranged from 8 to 2060 respondents. The most frequently studied syn drome was pneumonia (n=17), followed by acute otitis media (n=9), meningitis (n=7) and bacteremia/sepsis (n=4). Overall, each syndrome was associated with a substantial impact on HSU. Bacteremia/sepsis (range: 0.331 to 0.992) and meningitis (range: 0.330 to 0.977) were generally associated with the lowest HSU, followed by pneumonia (range: 0.054 to 0.998) and acute otitis media (range: 0.064 to 0.970). HSU estimates varied considerably by treatment setting, elicitation method and type of respondent. T he only study to compare pneumococcal infections to nonpneumococcal infections in the same population revealed significantly lower HSU estimates among pneumococcal infections. 34 Conclusions: Pneumococcal syndromes are associated with decreased HSU estimates. Given the considerable heterogeneity in methods and source populations as well as study quality, care should be taken to select the most appropriate estimates. 35 3.2 Introduction Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a gram -positive bacterium that commonl y causes infections among children, older adults and those with compromised immune systems [14]. Despite the success of vaccination programs in recent years, S. pneumoniae remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality across the world [14-16]. Pneumococcal infections can manifest as both invasive (meni ngitis, bacteremia) and non -invasive disease (non -bacteremic pneumonia, acute otitis media), imposing a significant burden on population health, particularly in developing nations. It remains the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia across the world, a nd was estimated to have caused over 300,000 deaths globally among children under 5 years of age in 2015 [16]. This translates to a substantial burden on health care systems through physician visits, hospitalizations and antibiotic prescriptions [18]. Due to emerging antibiotic resistance and serotype replacement, a continued emphasis on pneumococcal disease prevention and manage ment remains important. In order to assess the value of interventions, many national and local health organizations employ health technology assessments (HTA) [5, 6]. These assessments include an economic evaluation which appraises the balance of the inte rvention's cost relative to its effectiveness. Cost-utility analyses (CUA) are frequently the analysis of choice as their results can be compared across different therapeutic areas. CUAs measure the effectiveness of interventions in quality adjusted life yea rs (QALYs), a metric that integrates both quantity of life and health -related quality of life (HRQoL) [6 -9]. HRQoL is typically measured in terms of health state utilities (HSU), values representing the preference of a surveyed population for specific health states. HSUs are measured on a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health), although some health states can take on negative HSUs if they are considered by the surveyed population worse than death [6, 7]. 36 A number of different methods have been developed to e stimate HSU values, broadly categorized into direct and indirect elicitation methods [6 -8]. Direct methods consist primarily of the time trade -of (TTO), standard gamble (SG) and visual analogue scale (VAS), although there has previously been debate regardi ng the validity of VAS due to its lack of implicit trade -offs [10]. SG and TTO involve the presentation of a choice between the health state of interest and moving to full health (i) for a shorter period of time in TTO, or (ii) with a risk of sudden death i n SG. Indirect methods mainly consist of multi -attribute utility instruments (MAUI) such as the Health Utilities Index (HUI2/HUI3) and the EuroQol -5 Dimension (EQ -5D). MAUIs are questionnaires developed to assess HRQoL using a scoring algorithm based on on e of the direct methods to convert responses to a single HSU estimate The syndromes caused by S. pneumoniae infections can have a significant impact on the HRQoL of infected patients, particularly during the acute phase of illness. This impact can differ substantially between syndromes, with milder illnesses (e.g. acute otitis media) expected to result in higher HSU estimates compared to more severe illnesses (e.g. meningitis). Although reviews on HRQoL among patients with these syndromes have previously been published, these reports are either outdated, do not capture the impact of disease during the acute phase of infection, or exclusively included studies that used instruments incompatible with calculating HSUs [94-96]. In addition, published CUAs for interventions targeting pneumococcal disease have employed a wide range of HSU estimates from different sources to assess the potential benefits for population health [97]. This heterogeneity in HSU values for the same syndromes has the potential to impact study conclusions and the rationale for selecting each estimate is often not clearly outlined. Notably, many of the applied HSU estimates represent extrapolations from other related conditions, with most of the source studies having been p ublished more than 15 years 37 ago. Given the influence of HSU estimates on policy analyses and the continued importance of pneumococcal disease in public health, a better understanding of the available literature is warranted. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of HSU estimates for the acute phase of common pneumococcal syndromes to provide a clear overview of the outstanding gaps in the literature. 3.3 Methods 3.3.1 Search Strategy We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews [98]. The registered with PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO , registration number: CRD42017078165). We conducted a systematic search of the literature in six electronic databases from inception to January 1, 2020 : MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ec onLit, Health Technology Assessment Database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and the Tufts' Cost -Effectiveness Analysis Registry. A supplementary grey literature search was performed in Google Scholar (using the keywords Streptococcu s pneumoniae , otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, state utility or health -related quality -of-life) [99]. Finally, we hand - searched the reference lists of the studies that met our full -text inclusion criteria, along with the reference lists of existing reviews retrieved in our search, using a snowballing technique. 38 A comprehensive search strategy was developed in consultation with a library scient ist (M.S., Acknowledgements), and included MeSH/EMTREE subject headings as well as keywords for pneumococcal syndromes and health state valuations (see Appendix A for full search strategy) . The primary search strategy was developed in MEDLINE and adapted to other databases to account for database -specific vocabulary and functionality. The strategy was adapted from a recent publication describing search terms for studies estimating HSU values [100] . We also searched for CUAs of interventions or programs targeting S. pneumoniae, using a search strategy developed by the United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, to ensure we captured any HRQoL s tudies that were not retrieved in our original search, or not published separately from the cost -utility analysis [101] . Finally, we included previously publi shed reviews examining the impact of any of the pneumococcal syndromes on H SU values. We limited the search to English language articles, and excluded editorials, comments, letters, case reports and case series. 3.3.2 Study Selection We included primary observ ational studies and clinical trials eliciting HSU estimates for any of the following pneumococcal syndromes: acute otitis media (AOM), pneumonia/ lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), bacteremia/sepsis or meningitis. We included studies that presented vignettes describing the health state to individuals without the syndrome of interest, as well as studies where patients with the syndrome of interest, or a proxy, assessed their own health state. Among the studies where patients or proxies evaluated thei r own health state, we included those where patients were identif ied as being infected with laboratory -confirmed S.pneumoniae , or those where the pathogen causing infection was not identif ied. The decision to 39 include studies with unidentif ied or mixed pathogens was based on the fact that laboratory confirmation is rare for most of the included syndromes, and the vast majority of HSU studies are syndrome -based, rarely differentiating based on pathogen due to the similar expected disease course. However, we did exclude studies where patients were explicitly identified as being infected with a pathogen other than S. pneumoniae (e.g. only Staphylococcus aureus infections). Given the focus of our review on values that could be directly applied to CUAs, only s tudies that measured HSU using either direct methods or indirect MAUIs were included (see Appendix B for full list). Finally, our analysis focused on acute pneumococcal disease, so we excluded studies that exclusively examined long -term HRQoL (i.e. >3 mont hs post infection). Given the wide variety of complications and long -term sequelae that can arise from each of the considered syndromes (e.g. meningitis complications can include hearing loss, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, cognitive def icits), condu cting a comprehensive review of every potential sequelae health state was beyond the scope of the current study due to feasibility constraints [102] . Two reviewers (R.O. and S.Y.) independently screened titles, abstracts and full -text articles. Agreement was assessed by perce ntage and the kappa statistic. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third reviewer (B.S.). 3.3.3 Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers (R.O. and S.Y./J.B.). We attempted to contact authors for clarification and missing information where necessary. Studies where the authors were unable to provide sufficient information to meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Where studies did not provide numerical HSU values in -text, 40 we digitized the published graphs using open -access software to retrieve any missing values [103] . Where possible, the values obtained via digitization were compared to those discussed in the text to validate the accuracy of our digitized estimates. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the critical appraisal checklist developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute as well as the recently published risk of bias criteria for studi es assessing the relative importance of outcomes by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group [104,105] . We were unable to conduct a meta -analysis due to the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of study design, case definitions, patient populations and instruments administered. Hence, we used tables and narrative synopses to describe and synthesize the extracted data by syndrome. 3.4 Results The initial search identified 12,972 studies, of which 2,794 were duplicates and 9,872 were excluded after title and abstract screening. In total, 306 full -texts articles were retrieved and examined, of which 26 met our inclusion criteria (Figure 3-1 and Appendix C) [106-131]. The most common reasons for exclusion at full -text screening were studies not providing global H SU values, publication as a conference abstract only, and languages other than English. Reviewer agreement on title and abstract screening was 96% (k=0.82, 95% 0.56 -0.79). 41 Studies were grouped by pneumococcal syndrome for analysis. Most studies focused on the syndromes of interest, not the etiologic organism; only three studies included patients wi th laboratory -confirmed S. pneumoniae infections [109,115,116] . A number of other studies used vignettes to describe the relevant details of each pneumococcal syndrome to elicit corresponding HSU values, although none of the vigne ttes directly referenced S. pneumoniae . Multiple studies presented H SU estimates derived from more than one instrument, tariff set, population or setting. In addition, the timing of assessment varied substantially between studies from the first presentatio n at a clinic or hospital, to multiple weeks after symptom onset, with some studies collecting data at multiple time points. In total, within the 26 studies, there were 128 H SU estimates from 68 cohorts (Figure 3-2). 3.4.1 Acute Otitis Media Nine studies prese nted data on HSU for acute otitis media (Table 3-1).[106-114] Published from 1996 to 2017, the studies reported 24 HSU estimates from 12 cohorts ranging in size from 10 to 383 respondents. Studies were conducted in Europe (n=3), North America (n=3), Asia (n=2) and South America (n=1). Four studies included patients with recurrent acute otitis media, while the remaining s tudies recruited patients with non -recurrent infections. Most of the recent studies administered a MAUI to adult patients or caregivers, while four studies presented vignettes describing acute otitis media to either caregivers, the general public, a commit tee of experts, or a group of physicians. Only one study elicited responses from the affected children (7 years of age and older) with otitis media [109] . The most common instrument used to estimate HSU values was the visual analogue 42 Figure 3-1 PRISMA Flowchart - Study Selec tion Process Overall, the mean HSU estimates for the acute otitis media health state demonstrated wide variation from 0.064 to 0.970. Among patients with recurrent acute otitis media, the range of mean estimates was 0.418 to 0.675, which was lower than the majority of estimates for non - recurrent acute otitis media. 43 Table 3.1 Summary of health state utility (HSU) values for acute otitis media (AOM) Author (Year) Age Group (Mean) N (*Spn) Health State - Timing / Respondents:Vignette Instrument Utility (Mean \u00b1SD or Mean 95%CI) HEALTH STATE Crawford (2017) [106] 5 (2.1) 110 AOM - Overall VAS (OM 0.666 \u00b10.203(SD) 4 Kujala (2014) [107] \u00b10.194(SD) Heidemann (2013) [108] 6 (1.2) - acute otitis media; SD - - - Streptococcus pneumoniae time treatment; UK - United Kingdom EQ -5D Tariff Set; VAS - visual analogue scale 44 3.4.2 Pneumonia Seventeen studies elicited HSU data for pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections, with publication dates ranging from 1994 to 2019 (Table 3-2) [109-111,115 -128]. Most studies were conducted in Europe (n=10) or the United States (n=4), wh ile the remaining studies took place in Canada (n=2), Argentina (n=1) and Thailand (n=1). The 17 studies reported 65 HSU estimates from 30 cohorts with 8 to 2060 respondents. The most commonly used instrument was the EQ -5D (n=11), TTO the studies using the EQ -5D, tariff sets from the United Kingdom, Chile, Argentina, Thailand and multiple European cohorts were applied. Of note, two included studies applied different tariffs to the same responses to highlight the impact tariff sets have on HSU estimates [110,121] . The choice o f respondents varied across studies. Most of the recently published studies administered instruments to patients with pneumonia or their proxies, whereas older studies presented vignettes describing a hypothetical health state of pneumonia to patients, hea lth-care providers, a committee of experts, or a convenience sample of the public. The two studies that used proxies to complete an indirect instrument on behalf of a patient surveyed either the patient's parents or their nurse [109,123] . The severity of pneumonia episodes can vary substantially, therefore we have reported HSU by outpatient versus inpatient as a proxy for disease severity where possible. For vignettes in which a setting of care was not specifi ed, we assigned them as outpatient. For outpatient pneumonia cohorts, mean HSU ranged from 0.147 to 0.994, while estimates for inpatient cohorts ranged from -0.054 to 0.998. The extremes of these ranges of mean values were driven by a small 45 number of studi es. Both maximums were from a study which used SG to estimate HSU for a series of inpatient and outpatient vignettes [127] . The minimums of these ranges were driven primarily by two studies, which either assessed the HSU of nursing home patients or used the general public as respondents [110,123] . When these estimates were excluded, the floors of the ranges were 0.517 for outpatient pneumonia and 0.230 for inpatient pneumonia. There was no discernible difference in HSU for pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among similar popul ations. Notably, only two studies compared the HSU of infected s ubjects with the HSU of similar healthy subjects [119,123] . One was a study of nursing home patients, which recorded significantly lower HUI2 scores for patients with dementia who had developed pneumonia compared to those who had not (0.147\u00b10.066 vs. 0.170\u00b10.057, p=0.003) [123] . The other was a nested cohort study within a pneumococcal vaccination trial, and matched each infected s ubject with two uninfected controls using age, sex and EQ -5D score at the time of vaccination [119] . At the home visit within two weeks of discharge from hospital, as well as on a mailed questionnaire 1 month later, subjects who contracted pneumonia had consistently lower HSU as measured by the EQ -5D and EQ -VAS. At the home visit, the HSU of subject s with pneumonia was 0.14 lower on the EQ -5D compared to controls, and 0.11 lower than controls one month after the home visit. Finally, only three studies examined the HSU impact of pneumococcal pneumonia specifically [109,115,116] . Of these studies only one examined the difference between pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal infections [116] . In this study of 544 adult patients with severe LRTI presenting to primary care, patients with S. pneumoniae infections (n=26) had significantly lower 46 quality of life compared to the patients with non -pneumococcal infections (n=518) according to /Sepsis Four studies presented data on HSU for the acute phase of bacteremia, yielding 14 estimates from 8 cohorts ranging in size from 14 to 94 respondents [109-111,129] . These studies were conducted in the United States, Argentina and Thailand, with publication dates ranging from 2000 to 201 3. Three of the four studies presented respondents with vignettes, while the most recently conducted study administered HSU instruments to patients or their proxies. Respondents included parents or caregivers (n=2), the general public (n=1), and a committe e of experts and physicians (n=1). Several different instruments were used including the EQ -5D, HUI2, HUI3, VAS and SG. Overall, the estimated means varied markedly from -0.331 to 0.992. The only outpatient value was estimated by a panel of experts using t he HUI2 to assess a vignette, where they estimated a HSU of 0.93 .

These studies were the same as those reporting HSU data for bacteremia, with three additional studies from Canada, England and Scotland conducted from 1994 to 2018. Overall, mean HSU estimates ranged from -0.330 to 0.977, demonstrating the same substantial variability as seen in bacteremia. For both syndromes, one study, which surveyed the general public, reported the lowest estimates [110] . When this study was excluded, the floor of the range of estimates increased to 0.022. As in pneumonia, the study which employed the SG yielded values far higher than any other study, with its upper estimate of 0.977 being markedly higher than the next highest value of 0.733 [129] . As a result, if we exclu de these two studies, the range of estimates was 0.110 to 0.733. 51 Table 3.4 Summary of health state utility (HSU) values for meningitis Author (Year) Age Group (Mean) N (*Spn) Health State - Timing/ Respondents:Vignette Instrument Utility (Mean \u00b1SD Mean McGill (2018) [130] 16+ Bacterial 0.426 Caregivers: CHI EQ -5D HUI2/3 Utilities Index 2/3; - Intensive unit; INP - Inpatient care; N/A - not applicable; OUT - Outpatient care; SD - standard deviation; SG - standard gamble; Spn - Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; - United Kingdom -5D Tar iff Set; UNSPEC - Unspecified care setting; VAS - visual analogue scale 52 Figure 3-2 Summary of health state utility (HSU) values for included cohorts by syndrome.

Overall, there was significant heterogeneity in the comprehensiveness of the included studies, with many studies not pro viding sufficient information to fully assess methodological rigour. Nevertheless, given that our inclusion criteria limited the inclusion of studies to those using a validated and established instrument, all included studies met this criterion. The majori ty of studies presented clear description of the subjects and the setting from which they were recruited (85%). Similarly, all of the studies that included patients with the condition of interest noted the specific clinical criteria for inclusion or that t he conditions were physician diagnosed (81%). Most of the subjects recruited in these studies appeared to have relatively similar disease severity or were stratified by 53 disease severity in subgroup analysis. For the studies that employed the use of vignett es to describe health states, the descriptions were mostly comprehensive, although some studies did not describe the vignettes used in their studies. Several criteria that were inadequately addressed by a majority of the studies. These include describing s trategies to deal with confounding factors (38%), justification for the sample size (31%), and assessment of the understanding of respondents (19%). Two studies employed the use of a comparison population in their studies, although only one of these recrui ted patients from the same population where exposures were similarly measured [119,123] . 3.5 Discussion This systematic review provides an overview of the available HSU estimates for the acute phase of infectious syndromes caused by S. pneumoniae . These estimates have an influential role in many policy and economic evaluations, as the selection of HSU values can have a significant effect on the conclusions of burden of disease studies and CUAs which are used to direct funding [132,133] . Our review can serve to facilitate the selection of the most appropriate and highest quality HSU estimates for use in future analyses. While only three studies measur ed HSU among patients with confirmed S. pneumoniae infections, a number of other studies provided estimates for the syndromes of interest, which included AOM, pneumonia/LRTI, bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis. This was an expected outcome, particularly for the non -invasive syndromes such as AOM, because the etiology of these syndromes is rarely ascertained in clinical practice (Table 3- 3). 54 The only study to directly compare outcomes between pneumococcal and non -pneumococcal infections from the same populatio n identif ied icant dif estimates [116] . This analysis of LRTI patients employed a urine a ntigen test to identify pneumococcal infections and found that they were associated with signif icantly lower HSU estimates. The other two studies with conf irmed pneumococcal infections also focused on pneumonia/LRTIs, but did not have a non -pneumococcal co mparison group, thereby limiting potential comparisons given the differences in populations [109,119] . The reason for the observed difference remains unclear and was not elaborated on by the study authors in their manuscript. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the pneumococcal group was small relative to the non -pneumococcal group (26 vs. 518) and the proportion of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was signif icantly higher in the pneumococcal group (42.3% vs. 16.0%), which may have contributed to lower HSU estima tes as the results were not adjusted for baseline characteristics [116] . The degree of variability between HSU estimates for the same syndromes was unexpected, with estimates for each syndrome spanning nearly the entire range of possible values. This was likely the result of the heterogeneity of the studies, a s there was substantial variability in the respondent populations, timing of assessment after onset and HSU elicitation methods (i.e. direct vs. indirect). The most prominent outliers were driven by dif ferences in elicitation methods, with SG studies produ cing the highest values and EQ -5D yielding the lowest. Previous research has shown that direct HSU methods tend to elicit signif icantly higher HSU estimates compared to indirect methods, with EQ -5D often producing the lowest values among the indirect MAUIs [134] . When these outliers were excluded, the concentration of HSU estimates for each syndrome followed an expected pattern whereby me ningitis and bacteremia/sepsis were generally associated with lower HSU estimates, followed by pneumonia/LRTI and AOM. 55 With regards to quality assessment, some of the aspects unique to HSU studies, such as assessment of the respondents' understanding of t he exercises, were absent or not described in most papers. Due to the variable health literacy and potential language barriers inherent to HSU estimation, there remains value in this process [135,136] . Furthermore, the lack of information on sample size justif ications, response rates and approaches to address confounding was concerning, highlighting the dearth of high -quality studies in thi s field. Many of the studies surveyed a relatively small population, which increases the risk of selection bias and likely contributed to the wide conf idence intervals observed in some of the estimates. It is important to highlight this variance, as when t he estimates are incorporated into economic and policy analyses, it is critical to test values across this observed range in sensitivity analyses to acknowledge the uncertainty associated with the point estimates. Similarly, the lack of reported response r ates may conceal additional bias, particularly when comparison to non -responders was unavailable. Finally, only two of the seventeen studies that surveyed patients or proxies about their own health states included an una ffected control group, potentially r esulting in confounding from comorbidities [119,123] . A recent review conducted by Shiri and colleagues included a section focuse d on pneumococcal HSU estimates [93]. This section included nine studies assessing HSU for pneumococcal syndromes, three of which were excluded from our review due to their exclusive assessment of long-term outcomes or inappropriate application of HSU methods. We identif ied an additional 20 studies assessing HSU for pneumococcal syndromes to pro vide a more comprehensive assessment of the available literature. In addition to this study, we found only one other systematic review that included HSU estimates for the acute phase of pneumococcal syndromes, which focused on otitis media [94]. However, the only studies included in their review to assess 56 HSU combined patients with AOM and chronic otitis media with e ffusion into a single estimate. Given the dif ferences in progression and etiology between the two syndromes, we chose to exclude these studie s from our review. Despite this, we identif ied seven additional studies that examined HSU among AOM patients. Our review has several important limitations. First, only studies published in English were included. Second, our study only examined the impact of pneumococcal disease on HSU in the acute phase of the disease. While this was necessary due to feasibility limitations given the broad array of potential sequelae, this does not account for all the potential HRQoL decrements attributable to S. pneumonia e [137] . A small number of studies have examined the potential long-term impact of sepsis and meningitis o n HRQoL in the years after acute illness [138,139] . However, these studies did not specify the sequelae or other relevant symptoms experienced by the surveyed patients, likely minimizing the HR QoL decrement experienced by the proportion of patients with sequelae, as their responses were combined with patients without sequelae in these studies. Thirdly, the majority of the included studies where patients or proxies were surveyed did not identify the etiologic pathogen, therefore there exists the possibility that none of the patients were infected with S. pneumoniae. The lack of etiologic characterization is not unexpected for most of the syndromes examined given that it is rarely undertaken in rou tine clinical practice. Nevertheless, given the mixed etiology of these infections, there remains the possibility that the HSU values for pneumococcal infections could be systematically dif ferent, as evidenced by the single study in our review that reporte d signif icantly lower HSU values for pneumococcal LRTI. Despite these limitations, the present study represents the most comprehensive review to date of HSUs for syndromes associated with pneumococcal disease, highlighting the substantial 57 heterogeneity in methods and populations assessed. We conducted an extensive review of the literature in collaboration with a library scientist and extended our search to CUAs to ensure completeness. Given that the vast majority of studies adopted a syndrome -based approac h, the extracted data can be readily applied to other pathogens that cause syndromes such as pneumonia or meningitis. 3.6 Conclusion Pneumococcal disease has a considerable impact on HRQoL, resulting in decreased HSU estimates for the acute phase of illness. The literature to date has revealed significant variability in HSU estimates for each syndrome due to heterogeneity in methods and patient populations. Furthermore, many of the analyses were of low to moderate quality, and there is a need for more high-quality studies in this area. Given the observed variability, care should be taken to select the most appropriate estimate for the population of interest in policy and economic evaluations, as well as employing sensitivity analyses where appropriate given the wide variance observed for many of the estimates. Our review serves to facilitate this process by providing an overview of the currently available estimates across a number of populations alongside an assessment of each study's quality for optimal selecti on and application. Of note, the only study in our review to directly compare pneumococcal and nonpneumococcal infections in the same population revealed significantly lower HSU estimates among pneumococcal infections, although potential confounders were n ot adjusted for in this analysis. Given that the reasons for this difference are unclear, future research to characterize this potential difference, as well as the long -term complications and sequelae of pneumococcal syndromes is needed. 58 DIX Search strategy: MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In -Process & Other Non -Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1946 to 2019 Dec 31> # Searches 1 or infection*\" or

(2022) The attributable healthcare costs and epidemiology of community -acquired pneumonia in Ontario, Canada: a population -based cohort study . 73 4.1 Abstract Objective : The aim of the present study was to determine incidence -based short and long-term healthcare costs attributable to comm unity -acquired pneumonia (CAP) from the healthcare payer perspective in Ontario , Canada . Methods: We conducted a retrospective population -based matched cohort study of residents in Ontario, Canada (population 13 million) using health administrative data. We identified subjects with an incident episode of CAP (exposed subjects) between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014 . The index date of each episode was based on the first inpatient (ICD -10-CA codes: J12.x-J18.x) or outpatient claim (OHIP codes: 486) for pneumonia. Exposed subjects were matched without replacement to unexposed subjects from the general population using hard- and propensity score - matchi ng on age, sex, income quintile, rural residence, comorbidities and healthcare costs prior to index date. Attributable costs represented the mean difference in costs between the exposed subjects and their matched pairs. Results: We identified 692,090 subjects with at least one episode of CAP between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014 ( 5.2% of the total Ontario population) . Adults aged 65 years and older had the highest annual incidence rate of 50.1 episodes per 1,000 person -years, while adults aged 18-64 years and children (aged 0-17) had incidence rates of 12.9 and 24.7 episodes per 1,000 person -years, respectively . The majority of exposed subjects received outpatient care only (78.9%), with most episodes involving a single physician visit. The mean attributable costs were $2,256 (95%CI: $2,225 - $2,288 ) -$14,618 ) per inpatient CAP 74 episode , with mean episode lengths of 9.9 and 26.9 days respectively . Attributable costs were significantly higher for adult patients and those with high levels of comorbidit ies. Conclusion: Pneumonia is associated with a substantial ly increased acute and long-term healthcare costs compared to unexposed subjects. This is the first study to comprehensively assess the cost of pneumonia in Ontario, employ ing individual -level health administrative data, and will serve to inform strategic healthcare planning as well as the economic evaluation of future infecti ous disease interventions and immunization programs. 75 4.2 Introduction Community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common acute respiratory condition that disproportionately affects young children, older adults and patients with immunocompromising or chronic illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [18,29] . The severity of CAP can vary considerably between cases, with the majority of episodes only requiring care in the outpatient setting [28]. Nevertheless, C AP remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality, with many patients requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation [55,140,141] . In 2017, pneumonia represent ed the sixth most common cause of death in Canada when considered alongside infl uenza [27]. The overall incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations in Canada ranged from 611 per 100,000 in those under fi ve years of age to 3,002 per 100,000 in those over the age of 80 [29]. There is considerable variation in incidence rates between provinces, with Ontario having the lowest incidence across the country [29]. In the On tario Burden of Infectious Disease Study ( ONBOIDS) , pneumonia was identified as the most burdensome infectious disease syndrome in terms of the years and quality of life lost to infection. The study estimated that each year, pneumonia was responsible for an average of 1,954 deaths and 252,473 heal th care utilization episodes [26]. Several Canadian studies have attempted to quantify the economic burden of CAP, with estimated costs per case ranging from $1,836 to $8,993 [33,35,37,142] . However, these studies have been limited to the pediatric population , were conducted more than 10 years ago, or focused exclusively on hospitalization costs. To fully understand the population -level impact of CAP on the healthcare system, it is important to capture healthcare resource utilization and costs across patient p opulations and settings. This includes incorporating outpatient costs and the consequences of disease sequelae after the acute phase of illness. High-quality economic evidence is important for strategic health 76 system planning and critical to adequately ass ess the full spectrum of potential benefits of interventions. The purpose of our study is to assess the epidemiology and attributable healthcare costs of CAP among residents of all ages in Ontario, Canada. 4.3 Methods 4.3.1 Study Design We conducted a population -based matched cohort study of individuals with CAP to examine attributable healthcare costs up to one year post -index date , using health administrative data held at ICES (formerly known as Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences ). ICES houses a repository of individually -linked health service records for residents eligible for publicly funded healthcare in Ontario, Canada (nearly the entire population of 13 million with few exceptions: temporary visa holders, immigrants/former residents in the 3 month wait period for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), undocumented/non -status residents) [143] . Our study received ethics approval from the institutional review boards at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto. 4.3.2 Cohort We identified exposed subjects, i.e., subjects with incident episodes of CAP from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014 , following them up to 1 year after the onset of the incident episode . We used physician billing claims recorded in the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) databas e, emergency department (ED) visit information from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) and hospitalization information from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI -DAD) [144] . In the absence of validated al gorithms to identify 77 subjects with incident episodes of CAP, we included subjects with at least one healthcare encounter attributed to pneumonia using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Cana da (ICD -10CA) codes J12 -J18 for ED visits and hospitalizations, or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 8th Revision (ICD -8) code 486 for physician services. For the ICD -8 code 486, Canadian validation studies of outpatient pneumonia have reported a sensitivity of 38 -60%, specificity of 100%, and positive predictive value of 90 -91% [145,146] . For subjects with multiple episodes in the recruitment period, o nly one randomly selected episode was considered in our analysis. Hospitalizations were inclu ded if pneumonia was coded as the most responsible diagnosis, and excluded if pneumonia was identified as a post -admission diagnosis or if the subject had been hospitalized for any reason in the preceding 14 days in order to reduce the likelihood of includ ing hospital -acquired pneumonia . Episode length was defined as the time from first to last CAP claim (ICD -10CA J12 -J18, ICD -8 486). We defined CAP claims greater than 30 days apart as a new episode. Hence the index date for a new episode was the first CAP claim after the 30 -day period. Episodes were classified as \"inpatient\" if they included at least one hospitalization, with all others being classified as \"outpatient\". Due to the significant differences in comorbidities and pre -index date healthcare costs , we created four separate matched cohorts , applying patient care setting of the episode (inpatient vs. outpatient) and age group (0 -17, 18 +) as the stratifying variables. Setting of care was identified as an important variable on which to stratify given t he large discrepancy in costs between the two types of episodes, as well as the fact that it acts as a proxy for the severity of each episode. We further stratified on age given the differing relationship of increasing age with episode healthcare costs in each age group . Namely, as children age, the average costs tend to be lower , while greater age is associated with increased costs of care once adults reach advanced ages. 78 The pool of unexposed subjects was defined as Ontario residents without a CAP claim over the course of the recruitment period. Index dates within the recruitment period were randomly assigned to the pool of unexposed subjects, after which baseline covariates were collected from linked databases. We matched each exposed subject to one une xposed subject using a combination of hard and propensity score matching on a limited number of baseline covariates. We matched exposed subjects 1:1 to unexposed subjects without replacement. The propensity score was estimated via a logistic regression mod el that used exposure status as the outcome variable ( exposed vs un exposed ). In order to match exposed subjects to unexposed subjects with comparable baseline healthcare resource utilization, we specified a number of influential baseline covariates that were likely to have a direct impact on future healthcare costs . After testin g for the similarity of matched cohorts, we selected a model with the following dependent variables: age, gender , rural residence, income quintile, comorbidities and healthcare costs prior to the index date (see Appendix A for additional details). Comorbid ities were encoded using the John s Hopkins A ggregated Diagnostic Groups System which measures an individual's health resource utilization by assigning their ICD codes into diagnosis groups [147] . Healthcare costs prior to index date accounted for short -term (30 days prior to the index date ) and longer -term (1 year prior to index date ) healthcare costs. Subjects were hard matched 1:1 on sex, age (\u00b1 1 year) and propensity score using calipers equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score [148] . The balance of measured baseline covariates was assessed using standardized differences, with values less than 0.1 indicating negligible differences between the baseline characteristics of the matched subjects. 79 4.3.3 Analysis Healthcare costs w ere calculated from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health, including all publicly funded healthcare services: (1) inpatient hospitalizations, (2) same -day surgery procedures, (3) emergency department visits, (4) outpatient medications (for thos e aged 65 years or on social assistance), (5) physician services, (6) nonphysician services (e .g. physiotherapy), (7) outpatient laboratory tests, (8) rehabilitation services, (9) complex continuing care admissions, (10) homecare services, (11) long -term c are admissions, (12) dialysis clinic visits, (13) cancer clinic visits, and (14) assistive devices. These c osts were tabulated using person -level costing methods established by ICES - details regarding the components and calculations health administrative databases are provided in the costing guidelines by Wodchis et al [149] . We estimated healthcare costs attributable to CAP by calculating the mean difference between the matched exposed and unexposed subjects. To determine 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) we used non -parametric bootstrapping methods. We calculat ed attributable costs for each CAP episode, as well as 30 days, 6 months , and 1 year after the subject's index date. As a sensitivity analysis, we also examined the attributable cost burden over an expanded follow -up time of 2 and 3 years after the index d ate. For costs calculated beyond 1 year, we applied a discount rate of 1.5% [65]. We examined attributable costs by type of service (physician visits, emergency department, hospitalization, prescription drugs, other), as well as stratifying by age group, sex and those who died within 30 days. All costs were evaluated in 20 20 Canadian dollars. Finally, population data for the years 2012 -2014 from Statistics Canada were used to convert episode counts to annual incidence rates [150] . 4.3.4 Sensitivity Analyses To date, there has been no validated case definition to identify episodes of CAP from health administrative datasets. A number of different definitions have been employed in previous studies 80 and to address this potential variability , we conducted a number of alternative analyses to assess the impact of this variability. For inpatient episodes, we included two alternative definition s (Appendix B). The fi rst alternative definition (\"sensitive definition\") expanded the inpatient CAP episode s to include hospitalizations where pneumonia was coded as either the most responsible diagnosis or a pre -admission comorbidity. This provided the most sensitive definiti on, as it included the broadest range of pneumonia hospitalizations. The second alternative definition (\"tailored definition\") adopted a more nuanced approach and included all hospitalizations where pneumonia was either the (1) most responsible diagnosis, or was (2) a secondary diagnosis with a most responsible diagnosis of sepsis, meningitis, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), empyema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation/infection, excluding those where pneumonia was classified as a post -admission comorbidity. In th ese definitions , we also expanded the considered ED visits to include COPD with lower respiratory tract infections or exacerbations. For outpatient episodes, we conducted a sensitivity analys is where we excluded all outpatient CAP episodes that had any hospitalization costs in the 30 days after index date. This was done to remove episodes where a non -CAP hospitalization was incidentally included in the costing periods after index date (e.g. co ngestive heart failure), thereby inflating the overall estimated costs attributable to CAP. 4.4 Results 4.4.1 Study Cohort We identified 692,090 subjects with at least one episode of CAP between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014 ( 5.2% of the total Ontario popul ation). The mean age was 47.0 years (SD: 29.6), 81 51.7% were female, and 17.5% were identified as high resource users of the heal thcare system at baseline (highest resource utilization band) . The total number of episodes over this time period was 847,328 ; an average of 1.2 2 episodes per exposed s ubject . The number of episodes per subject varied from 1 to 20, although this distribution was heavily right -skewed with most subjects experiencing a single episode ( 62%). This dis tribution differed by age w ith adults 65 years and older being more likely to experience more than 1 episode (48.7%) over the recruitment period than the younger age groups ( 31.6%). The overall annual incidence of CAP for the cohort was 2 1.0 episodes per 1,000 person -years, although there was substantial variation between age groups. Adults aged 65 years and older had the highest annual incidence rate of 5 0.1 episodes per 1,000 person -years, while adults aged 18 -64 years and pediatric subjects (aged 0 -17 years) had incidence rates of 12.9 and 2 4.7 episodes per 1,000 person -years, respectively (Figure 4 -1). The average length of each episode was 11.3 days, which differed significantly between inpatient ( 26.9 days) and outpatient ( 9.9 days) episodes (p<0.001) . Figure 4-1 Incidence of outpatient and inpatient episodes of care for community -acquired pneumonia by age group over the recruitment period Age Groups Outpatient Inpatient82 Most episodes of CAP were treated exclusively in the outpatient setting ( 92.6%), with 67% of these episodes consisting of a single visit to an outpatient clinic. Of the outpatient episodes, 34% involved treatment in the emergency department. There w as a notable difference between age groups in the proportion of episodes involving a hospitalization. Specifically, among adults aged 65 years and older, inpatient episodes represented 12.3% of the total, compared to 4.6% among those younger than 65 years. The mean length of stay for CAP hospitalizations was 8.2 days, with 10% of patients requiring intensive care. 4.4.2 Matching Results Across the four matched cohorts, we successfully matched 96.6% to 99.7% of exposed s ubjects to unexposed s ubjects from the general Ontario population (Table 4 -1 & 4 -2), with nearly all standardized differences being less than 0.1. The lowest successful matching rate was for adult outpatient episodes (96.6% ), with the matching rate of the remaining groups all exceeding 99%. In general, the unmatched subjects had higher pre -index healthcare costs and more comorbi dities. A comparison of the matched and unmatched exposed s ubjects for each cohort is presented in Appendix C. 83 Table 4.1 Demographics of exposed subjects with outpatient episodes of care and unexposed subjects before and after matching.

The mean attributable costs were $2,256 (95%CI: $2,225 -$2,288 ) (95%CI: $14.040 -$14,618) per inpatient CAP episode. The largest proportion of the attributable costs were accrued in the first 10 days of each episode (Figure 4-2, 4-3). There was a substantial differenc e in costs between age groups for both CAP outpatient and inpatient episode s (Figure 4 -4). While the mean attributable cost of outpatient episodes increased linearly with age, the attributable cost of inpatient episodes was highest among adults aged 18 -64, and lowest among pediatric subjects . Subjects aged 18 -64 years had lower rates of early mo rtality (within 30 days) compared to adults 65 years and older ( 4.8% vs 1 5.1%, p<0.01 ) and hence a longer mean length of stay. Inpatient episodes where subjects were admitted to an intensive care unit had higher costs than those who were not ($36,985 vs. $ 11,791) , due to higher resource use and longer overall hospital length of stay ( 15.3 days vs. 7.4 days). In terms of costs beyond the initial episode, exposed subjects with outpatient CAP episodes had mean attributable cumulative 30 -day, 6-month and 1 -year costs Subjects with inpatient CAP episodes had mean attributable 30 -day, 180 -day and 1 -year costs 86 Figure 4-2 Total absolute healthcare costs in 10 -day increments for exposed and un exposed subjects during outpatient episodes of care for community -acquired pneumonia .

A. Age Outpatient Episodes n Episode 30 days 6 months 1 year components among subjects with inpatient CAP episodes were hospitalization costs (76%) and physician service fees (12%), accounting for 88% of attributable costs (Figure 4-4). In contrast, attributable costs for subjects with outpatient services were more evenly distributed between non-pneumonia hospitalizati ons (67%), physician service fees ( 16%), and emergency department services ( 10%). When patients with hospitalization costs in the 30 days after index date were excluded, the proportion of the costs represented by emergency department services (30%) and physician service fees (33%) increased significantly. 88 Figure 4-4 Source of attributable healthcare costs for inpatient and outpatient episodes of community -acquired pneumonia . Outpatient subgroup has excluded any episodes with any hospitalization costs (pneumonia and non -pneumonia) in the first 30 days after index date . Thirty -day all -cause mortality was si gnificantly higher among exposed s ubjects than the corresponding matched un exposed s ubjects (p<0.05) , although this varied s ubstantially with setting of care and age . Among adults 65 years and older, 30 -day all -cause mortality for exposed subjects was 9.8%, significantly higher than for adults aged 18 -64 years and pediatric subjects (1.0% to 0.03%, p<0.05). Inpatient mortality rates were significantly higher across all age groups relative to outpatient mortality rates ( 10.3% vs 3. 8%, p<0.05). Exposed subjects with inpatient CAP episodes who died in the first 30 days post index date demonstrated lower attributable healthcare costs per episode relative to exposed subjects who survived 30 days ($ 12,906 vs. $ 14,461 , p<0.05 ). As expected, episode lengths were significantly different between these two cohorts (9.6 days for those who died vs. 28.7 days fo r those who survived, p<0.05). Among the different types of ICD -10CA CAP codes in administrative data, \"Unspecified Pneumonia \" (J18.9 ) accounted for 81% of included inpatient CAP episodes (most responsible diagnosis). When the attributable costs for episo des with unspecified CAP were compared Hospitalization Physician Fees Emergency Drugs Long-Term Care & Home Care Other89 with an agent specified code in the administrative data ( e.g., J13 - Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae ), we found that episodes identified using code J18.9 were associated with significantly lower att ributable costs relative to those with a specified etiologic agent ($ 16,916 vs. $ 13,582 , p<0.01). Similarly, hospitalizations for unspecified CAP were found to have significantly shorter lengths of stay, likely contributing to the lower attributable costs (p<0.05). Furthermore, hospitalizations with a secondary ICD -10CA code for sepsis, meningitis or empyema, indicating complications of CAP were found to be associated with significantly higher attributable costs. 4.4.4 Sensitivity Analyses When examining the at tributable costs for extended follow -up times, it was found that subjects with inpatient CAP episodes continued to accrue excess costs up to 3 years after their index date, relative to their matched pairs. Specifically, in the 2 and 3 years after the index date of the inpatient CAP episode, cumulative attributable healthcare costs were found to be $2 3,325 ), respectively. With regards to the impact of the alternative episode algorithms , it was found that the inpatient alternatives resulted in a higher number of inpatient CAP episodes and a lower number of outpatient CAP episodes over the recruitment period. In addition, these analyses generated high er attributable cost estimates for inpatient CAP episodes (see Appendix D for full results). Nevertheless , these algorithms generated similar results in terms of the trends observed in attributable healthcare costs across age groups . 90 In terms of the outpa tient sensitivity analysis, it was found that excluding patients with any hospitalization costs in the first 30 days resulted in significantly lower attributable costs. As shown in Figure 4 -4, this decrease was primarily the result of eliminating non -pneum onia hospitalization costs included in the episodes. This resulted in the exclusion of approximately 14% of the original outpatient episodes (see Appendix D for full breakdown). 4.5 Discussion Our analysis provides a population -based assessment of the clinic al and healthcare costs associated with CAP in the Ontario setting. By taking advantage of local comprehensive health administrative databases, we were able to quantify the individual level costs and healthcare utilization for patients with CAP from a numb er of important and policy -relevant subgroups. Our results provide insight into the substantial burden CAP imposes on the healthcare system due to its high incidence and severe health consequences. Exposed s ubjects were found to have substantially higher healthcare costs than comparable unexposed s ubjects for up to one year post index date. Among subjects with inpatient CAP episodes, this excess cost was present up to 3 years after the original index date. However, because exposed subjects had fewer surviv ors at these time points, time may have introduced unobserved differences between exposed and un exposed s ubjects. Nevertheless, t he higher costs accrued after the defined episode of CAP m ay indicate the presence of long -term sequelae or an overall deterioration of health (especially in older adults), potentially leading to increased healthcare utilization such as a transition to long -term care after hospitalization. This is supported by evi dence from a number of other studies 91 that suggest inpatient episodes of pneumonia are associated with decreased long -term survival [140,151 -155]. Of note, two recent studies from the United States examining insurance claims databases have demonstrated simil ar long-term increases in healthcare costs after episodes of CAP, consistent with our findings in Ontario, Canada [156,157] . These studies used similar definitions and exclusions as our analysis, with one of the studies also using a retrospective matched cohort strategy. These excess costs were shown to persist for up to 2 years in one study (which examined inpatient and outpatient CAP episodes as a single group), while the other study (which only cons idered inpatient CAP episodes) demonstrated attributable costs persisting up to 3 years. This consistency across jurisdictions lends further support to the potential for long -term differences in post-CAP morbidity requiring healthcare utilization. Our CAP incidence estimates were generally similar to those found by other recent Canadian studies examining the incidence of CAP in the inpatient setting [29,36,55] . Nevertheless, our estimated CAP incidence was notably higher than reported in some recent studies from the United States using similar methodologies with administrative databases such as Medicare and the Optum Research Database [141,158,159] . The reason for these discrepancies is unclear; however, it may reflect differences in treatment -seeking behaviour and healthcare access, infection rates, or coding practices, particularly since most United States healthcare databases use ICD-9 coding as opposed to t he ICD - 10CA coding system used in Canada. The estimates of incidence also varied between the episode algorithm used in the primary analysis and the two alternative algorithms included in the sensitivity analysis. In particular, there was a larger number of inpatient CAP episodes identified in the sensitivity analyses, with a concomitant increase in the estimated attributable healthcare costs for these episodes. This higher incidence was the product of expanding the inclusion criteria for CAP inpatient episo des, while the higher costs were the result of including patients with more severe 92 illness . This is due to the nature of the coding system used in health administrative databases, as patients who present with CAP that worsens in hospital to become sepsis upon admission , will most likely have sepsis listed as their most responsible diagnosis. This type of CAP episode was excluded from the primary analysis ; however , it is likely to have been more severe than hospitalizations where CAP is listed as the most re sponsible diagnosis, thereby leading to higher attributable costs. A similar rationale underlies the observed differences in costs between hospitalizations with \"Unspecified Pneumonia \" (J18.9 ) as the most responsible diagnosis and those with a pathogen specified code ( e.g., J13 - Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae ). This is a product of the fact that patients with uncomplicated CAP often don't require culturing to identify an etiologic agent or are discharged prior to the culture results being fin alized. In contrast, those with more severe presentations will typically require cultures to guide appropriate medical management . To the best of our knowledge , our analysis is the first population -based study to estimate the incidence of outpatient CAP a nd its associated costs in Canada. Despite the fact that the attributable costs per outpatient episode are an order of magnitude less compared to inpatient episodes, the high incidence of these episodes contributes to a substantial cumulative burden. Notab ly, it was found that a small proportion of the outpatient episodes (14%) had non -pneumonia hospitalization costs included in the episode period, which had a substantial impact on estimated overall costs. When these episodes were removed, the attributable healthcare costs associated with outpatient episodes decreased. The se extra costs may be the result of misclassification in coding, or a subsequent health event triggered by the infection (e.g. congestive heart failure exacerbation). Relative to previous evaluations of the healthcare costs attributable to inpatient episodes of CAP, our estimates were significantly higher , even in the short -term [33,35,37,142] . The reason for this is 93 likely two-fold. Firstly, most previous analyses have exclusively considered hospitalization costs, thereby excluding pre - and post -admission care. In the majority of cases, the care associated with an episode of CAP is not limited to the time spent in hospital but can include pre -admission clinic and ED visits, as well as home care and long -term care after discharge . Secondly, our analysis took an incidence -based approach to assess longitudinal episodes of care. A benefit of this design is the accurate estimation of the burden imposed by an episode of CAP, which may not be limited to a single hospitalization. W hen relevant changes in care such as hospital transfers and readmissions are not considered , the number of hospitalizations attributed to CAP is likely to represent an over - estimate of the number of CAP episodes , and as a consequence, the costs per episode can represent an underestimate. By highlighting the substantial economic burden of CAP, our study can serve to inform health policy decisions co ncerning interventions targeting CAP and priority setting for future investments . This may include resource allocation for vaccination programs , diagnostic testing , or educational public health initiatives . Although differences in the structure of healthca re funding exist between provinces, they remain sufficiently similar to allow the costing estimates from this study to be generalizable across the country , as well as to jurisdictions with similar healthcare systems and population health profiles. Our study relies on health administrative data, which provide limited clinical detail as they are primarily intended for billing purposes. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that many health conditions are not optimally coded in these databases, lead ing to misclassification bias. Infectious diseases are especially prone to coding errors due to the non -specific presentation of many conditions. This may have led to under - or overreporting CAP incidence depending on the directionality of these biases. In particular, outpatient cases involving a single visit to a health practitioner may be particularly susceptible to this type of error, as physicians may use the ICD code 94 for CAP (486) to encompass a broad range of illnesses. Nevertheless, Canadian validati on stud ies of this code have indicated that the positive predictive value o f this code was 90 -91% for both adult and pediatric populations [145,146] . However, the sensitivity was suboptimal in both cases (38% and 60%) , so there is a possibility that we have underestimate d outpatient incidence. An additional limitation to our study was the var iables that we could employ in our propensity -score model for the purposes of matching exposed s ubjects to those who are un exposed . Our model used previous healthcare utilization as proxy for health status factors not accounted for by our comorbidity varia bles and other factors that could influence resource utilization. However, many lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, can affect the severity of episodes, which we were unable to account for due to the limitations of our data. Unobserved c haracteristics such as smoking could be more common in our exposed s ubjects relative to our un exposed s ubjects, leading to an independent increase in resource utilization and therefore an overestimate of the effect of CAP on healthcare costs. Finally, we w ere unable to match all of the exposed s ubjects across the four groups . Unmatched exposed s ubjects tended to have unusually high pre -index and post -index healthcare costs. This could have led to an underestimate of the costs attributable to CAP, since thes e subjects were excluded from the overall estimates. Our study's primary strengths were the population -based sample, which enhanced the generalizability of our results, and use of individually linked datasets. This allowed us to develop a comprehensive strategy to identify exposed s ubjects and incorporate a broad range of publicly funded healthcare services in our cost analysis. The matched cohort design of the study allowed us to account for patient baseline healthcare costs to reduce confounding. In part icular, the use of pre - index date healthcare costs as a matching variable facilitated more comparable matched pairs in terms of baseline healthcare utilization and costs. Importantly, the healthcare costs considered in our 95 analysis included nearly all publ icly-funded healthcare services in Ontario, allowing us to develop a more complete understanding of the economic burden imposed by CAP relative to previous analysis which limited their estimates to hospitalization costs. 4.6 Conclusion Our study demonstrates that CAP is associated with substantial short - and long -term healthcare cost s. This is the first study to assess the population -based attributable healthcare costs of CAP in Ontario, providing important evidence for strategic healthc are planning and to inform economic evaluations of CAP interventions. The findings provide evidence that points toward a potential long -term impact of CAP beyond the acute phase of illness, although the precise cause of this increased healthcare utilizatio n remains a topic for future work. 96 4.7 Appendices 4.7.1 APPENDIX A Table 4.4 Matching Variables Variables Description Age Measured in years.

(202 2) The cost -utility of 13 -valent pneumococc al conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in immunocompetent older adults (65+) in Ontario, Canada, in the context of infant immunization 103 5.1 Abstract Objective : The 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is currently not funded for immunocompetent adults in Canada, despite being approved by Health Canada. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost -utility of publicly funding PCV13 for older adults in Ontario, Canada. Methods : We performed a cost -utility analysis using an individual -level state transition model to examine the impact of funding PCV13 for adults aged 65 years and over, in addition to the current standard of care, the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23), from the healthcare payer perspective in Ontario, Canada . Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in Canadian dollars (CAD) were calculated over a lifetime time horizon, discounted at 1.5%. Data on serotype prevalence, transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from local laboratory data, population -based health administrative databases and a systematic search of the literature. The impact of parameter uncertainty was examined using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Result s: In the base case analysis, the addition of PCV1 3 to the current standard of care (PPV23) resulted in an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER ) of $132,886/QALY for adults vaccinated at age 65 years. The ICER increased with age of vaccination as life expectancy decreased. However, the analysis was highly sensitive to the proportion of all -cause pneumonia attributable to S.pneumoniae , PCV13 effectiveness against pneumonia, and PCV13 effectiveness against serotype 3. The success of infant immuni zation has reduced the prevalence of PCV13 serotypes among the older adult population via herd immunity, limiting the additional value provided by the vaccine. Based on probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability of adding PCV13 to PPV23 being cost -effective was 4.2% and 36.1% at thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY. 104 Conclusion : Adding PCV13 to PPV23 is unlikely to be cost -effective for immunocompetent older adults given the success of PCV13 infant immunization programs. Although there is s ome uncertainty regarding the incidence of vaccine -type pneumonia, the cost -effectiveness of adding PCV13 to PPV23 is likely to worsen over time in all scenarios as these serotypes become less prevalent. 105 5.2 Introduction Despite the success of pneumococcal v accination programs, Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality across the world [16,29] . In most regions, S.pneumoniae represents the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia, resulting in substantial health burden and healthcare costs due to hospitalizations and physician visits [29]. Adult s older than 65 years of age are particularly vulnerable to infection and severe disease as a result of chronic disease and immunosenescence. In response, many high -income countries, including Canada, have introduced vaccination programs for this age group , providing the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) which covers 23 of the known pneumococcal serotypes. However, in recent years, emerging evidence has brought into question the effectiveness of PPV23, particularly against community -acqu ired pneumonia (CAP) [162] . A recent large clinical tria l demonstrated the efficacy of 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) against both CAP and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among adults aged 65 years and older [49]. Although PCV13 is currently funded for immunocompromised adults, no province in Canada has funded the vaccine for immunocompetent adults, and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recently recommended against routine population -level immunization for adults without risk factors [23]. Nevertheless, they did maintain their individual -level recommendation of the vaccine for patients desiring additional protection, given the demonstrated efficacy of the vaccine against vaccine serotypes. T he only published cost -effectiveness analysis for the Canadian context, which was funded by the manufacturer Pfizer and not considered in the NACI recommendation, has suggested that the vacci ne would likely be cost -effective for adults aged 65 and older [22]. 106 PCV13 has been included in the routine infant immunization schedule since late 2010 in Ontario [19]. Previous evidence has indicated significant decreases in the incidence of vaccine serotypes among older adults with the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) for infants in Ontario [19]. We therefore sought to in corporate the impact of this herd immunity on the incidence of PCV13 serotypes among older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of funding PCV13 and PPV23 for immunocompetent adults 65 years and older in Ontario, Canada's largest province, in the context of infant immunization programs using PCV13. 5.3 Methods We conducted a cost -utility analysis to evaluate the impact of funding PCV13 in addition to PPV23 for adults aged 65 years and older in Ontario, Canada. Based on the individual recommendation by the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NAC I), PCV13 would be provided first followed by at least an eight -week delay after which individuals would be eligible to receive PPV23 [53]. Our analysis projected lifetime healthcare costs and quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) for both vaccination strategies (PCV13+PPV23 vs. PPV23 alone) from the healthcare payer perspective (Ontario Ministry of Health an d Long -Term Care, MOHLTC). All publicly -funded healthcare costs were considered, including vaccination program costs (vaccine cost, vaccine administration cost, and costs of treating adverse events following immunization) and treatment costs for invasive p neumococcal disease (IPD), inpatient CAP and outpatient CAP. Health outcomes included QALYs, number of cases of CAP and IPD, and deaths. 107 5.3.1 Model Structure We developed an age -specific health state transition model consisting of three health states: \"health y\", \"sequelae\" & death (Figure 5-1). We simulated cohorts of 100,000 individuals of a specified age and followed them in 1 -year time steps (cycles) over their lifetime. Individuals in the \"healthy\" health state were at risk of infection, manifesting as one of the following syndromes: outpatient CAP, We assumed individuals could only experience one syndrome per year. Patients could transition from \"healthy\" to \"sequelae\" if they suffered permanent seq uelae (hearing loss or neurological deficits) from IPD -M. Individuals in the \"sequelae\" group could not transition back to the \"healthy\" state and remained at the same risk for pneumococcal syndromes as those who remained in the \"healthy\" state during each annual cycle , with an additional quality of life decrement . At the end of the cycle, individuals in the \"healthy\" group could recover and transition back to \"healthy\", or transition to the \"sequelae\" or death state, depending on the individual's disease h istory. During each cycle, patients were at risk for both all -cause mortality as well as disease -specific mortality due to either IPD -M, IPD -B or inpatient CAP if they were infected. No incremental mortality was assumed for outpatient CAP. Age represented the primary risk factor modelled in this analysis, with probabilities and costs varying by age. Individuals were assigned an age at the beginning of the analysis, which increased with each annual cycle. The potential benefits of indirect protection from v accination of older adults ( e.g., 65 years and older) for unvaccinated cohorts ( e.g., younger than 65 years ) from a PCV13 program were not considered in our analysis due to low uptake rates of the currently funded PPV23 and previous work demonstrating that vaccination of older adults is unlikely to produce substantial herd immunity [91,163] . 108 A. B. Figure 5-1A/B. Simplified schematic of health state model. A. Patients spent each annual cycle in one of the three health states: Healthy, Sequelae, Death. B. During each annual cycle , patients in the healthy and sequelae states were at risk of infecti on from one of the 4 pneumococcal syndromes considered in our analysis. Patients who suffered from meningitis were at risk of progressing to the sequelae health state. During each cycle, patients were also at risk of all -cause mortality from other sources.

Age -specific values were used wherever available to examine the impact of vaccination at different ages. Most parameters, including the rates of infection and healthc are costs, were derived from Ontario databases, with the remaining data being sourced from the published literature.

Isolates sent to the Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) are serotyped with all results included in iPHIS. The serotype data available was limited to IPD (2007 -2019) and given that there is no routinely collected data for the ser otypes causing pneumococcal pneumonia in Ontario, we applied the same distribution to cases of CAP as has been done previously [174-177]. We 111 categorized serotypes into one of four (1,3,5,6A,7F,19A), - vaccine types (NVT). Not all IPD samples included in iPHIS could be serotyped. The annual proportion of total samples with missing serotypes varied from 12 to 23% among patients 65 years and over. For the purposes of the analysis, we assumed that these patients had a similar serotype distribution as those serotypes included in the analysis. Notably, the re has been a marked decline in unique PCV13 serotypes among adults 65 years and older since the introduction of PCV13 to the infant immunization program in 2011 ( Appendix A ). We projected these trends forward to appropriately account for the decreasing incidence of PCV13 serotypes. For additional scenario analyses, we separated serotype 3 from t he rest of the unique PCV13 serotypes, since there has been emerging evidence suggesting PCV13 may be less effective against it, as well as the fact that it has shown a markedly different trend than the other included serotypes since the infant program was introduced [30,178,179] . Based on the decreases observed in PCV7 serotypes among adults 65 years and older after its introduction to the infant immunization program (Appendix C), we fit an exponential function to the incidence of unique PCV13 serotypes to predict 5 to 10 year incidence rates [19]. Incidence rates of PCV7, unique PPV23 and NVT serogroups were also forecasted base d on observed trends since 2011. 5.3.4 IPD Incidence and Mortality Annual IPD incidence rates for three age groups (65 -74, 75 -84, 85+ years) were based on the iPHIS data used to estimate serotype distribution. The rates increased with age . We used previously published data from Ontario to estimate the proportion of IPD leading to meningitis or bacteremia, 112 the probability of long -term sequelae (i.e. hearing loss, neurological deficits) associated with meningitis, and case -fatality rates [19]. To account for potential underreporting in reportable disease data, we conducted sensitivity analyses where we inflated the incidence of IPD. 5.3.5 CAP Incidence and Mortality Incidence and case -fatality rates of inpatient and ou tpatient CAP were estimated based on health administrative data held at ICES. ICES houses population -level databases on publicly funded healthcare utilization including all physician services, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Given the poo r sensitivity of health administrative data coding for pneumococcal pneumonia, we chose to calculate rates for all -cause CAP and then calculate the number of cases attributable to S.pneumoniae by applying an estimate of 10.1% based on a recent Canadian stu dy of hospitalized pneumonia patients [30]. A more detailed description of the methodology used in estimation is available in Appendix B. To calculate serogroup -specific incidence rates of CAP, we applied the serotype distributions from the IPD datasets to the incidence of pneumococcal CAP, a ssuming that the serotype distribution would be similar between the syndromes. This was necessary due to the lack of serotype data on pneumococcal CAP in Ontario. A recent paper examining the contribution of S.pneumoniae to hospitalized CAP was used as a c omparison to assess the validity of these estimates [30]. 113 5.3.6 Vaccine Efficacy Vaccination was assumed to only be effective against serotypes contained in the given vaccine, with no assumption of cross -protection. Age -specific PCV13 vaccine effectiveness against IPD and CAP was based on a post -hoc analysis of the CAPITA trial by the study authors (Appendix B) [167] . Given that the trial was not powered to detect age -specific efficacy, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the effect iveness among those aged 85 years and older. Based on the trends observed in the post -hoc analysis, we assumed that eff ectiveness would decline to a minimum of 20% and 45% for CAP and IPD respectively at age 85 years . In terms of the duration of vaccine effective ness, based on data from the CAPITA trial population we assumed PCV13 eff ectiveness would remain constant for the first five years, followed by a linear decline to zero over the subsequent five years [168] . A number of alternative vaccine waning scenarios were tested in sensitivity analyses as outlined in Appe ndix B. 5.3.7 Quality Adjusted Life Years We calculated QALYs based on utility weights from the literature to account for the decrement in quality of life from each episode of illness. Utility values for non -infected patients were based on data from the Canadia n National Population Health Survey (NPHS) from which age -specific utilities were calculated using the Health Utilities Index II (HUI2 ) [173] . The utility weight associate d with an episode of hospitalized CAP was derived from a case -control study nested within CAPITA which administered the EQ -5D to hospitalized patients [170] . This estimate was also applied to IPD. For outpatient CAP, estimates were taken from a large observational study conducted across Europe evaluating the impact of outpatient lower respiratory tract infections using the EQ -5D [180] . The 114 duration of the utility decrement was based on the length of stay for inpatient CAP and IPD, and assumed to be 5 days for outpatient CAP. 5.3.8 Costs The cost for both vaccines were based on local pharmacy prices. Given that the government negotiates confidential volume discounts with manufacturers, we assumed the price paid by the Ontario MOHLTC was 30% less than the list price. Administration costs by physicians were based on the assumption that patients would receive their vaccination during a scheduled visit. Given the recommendation for an eight -week delay between PCV13 and PPV23, for the PCV13+PPV23 strategy we also included the costs of a separate visit for the administration of the PPV23 vaccine. Patient -level costs for each episode of care for outpatient CAP, inpatient CAP and IPD were calculated using the same health a dministrative datasets employed to calculate incidence rates. These estimates incorporated costs for physician services, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, continuing care, rehabilitation care, mental health services, home care and prescription drugs. By applying unit costs to each service accessed by patients, a total cost per episode was obtained. In order to account for baseline healthcare use, patients were matched to patients of similar age and resource use to calculate the attributable cos ts for each episode (Appendix B). All costs are expressed in 20 20 Canadian dollars ($CAD). 115 5.3.9 Analyses Our model was used to estimate the future incidence, cost and disease burden of pneumococcal disease among individuals from their entry into the model unt il death. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at 1.5% annually [181] . We conducted both single cohort and multi -cohort analyses; with the multi -cohort model examining 10 consecutive cohorts being vaccinated at age 65 and their overa ll outcomes as the serotype distributions changed over time. The base case was a single cohort model which assumed funding would begin in 2020, individuals would be vaccinated at age 65 and the proportion of pneumococcal disease caused by unique PCV13 sero types would continue to decline. Scenario analyses varying the year of program initiation (20 20 - 2030), the age of the cohort being vaccinated (65/70/75/80/85 -year-olds) and alternative serotype forecasts were conducted to assess alternative circumstances . A series of deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of individual parameter uncertainty on cost -effectiveness, including the vaccine efficacy, vaccine price, incidence of infection, healthcare costs, utility decrem ents, mortality rates, and the proportion of all - cause CAP attributable to S.pneumoniae . Further, we conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess joint parameter uncertainty. All analyses were performed using TreeAge Pro (TreeAge Software, Wili amstown, MA). 5.4 Results 5.4.1 Base Case Analysis Results for the single cohort base case analysis are presented in Table 2. For 100,000 individuals adding PCV13 to PPV23 is expected to result in a decrease of 117 outpatient CAP episodes (36,370 116 vs. 36,486), 24 inpatient CAP episodes (15,262 vs. 15,285), 19 IPD episodes (421 vs. 440), and 6 deaths (2,806 vs. 2,812) attributable to S.pneumoniae infections over their lifetim e. This translated to an expected gain of 82.4 QALYs. Notably, 94.4% of the QALYs gained were attributable to preventing early mortality, with the remaining 5.6% due to preventing reduced quality of life during illness. Despite improved health outcomes, the addition of PCV13 to PPV23 for 65 year olds would increase costs by $10.95 million from the healthcare payer perspective. This resulted in an ICER of $132,886 per QALY gained . The multi -cohort model of vaccination at age 65 years resulted in a marginally higher ICER ($147,312/QALY) due to the projected continued decline in PCV13 serotypes. The cost -effectiveness of adding PCV13 decreases when vaccinating older individuals because most of the program's benefits can be attributed to reduced mor tality, i.e., there is a concurrent decline in the benefits of achieved by avoiding infection despite an increase in disease incidence (Figure 5-2). 117 Table 5.2 Average per patient base -case results of adult s vaccinated at age 65 in Ontario, Canada, discounted at 0%, 1.5% and 3%. Vaccination Costs ($) Healthcare Costs include administration costs and cost per vaccine. ICER = incremental cost -adjusted life ye ar. 5.4.2 Scenario Analyses Variations in forecasted serotype distribution did not substantially alter the conclusions of the analysis. Even in situations where we assumed no further decline in PCV13 serotype incidence, the ICER remained above $100,000/QALY. 118 Given the declining pre valence of PCV13 serotypes causing disease in older adults, we also estimated the impact of the year of PCV13's introduction. As expected, each year of delay resulted in an increasingly higher ICER, with a program started in 2025 producing an ICER of $138, 729/QALY. 5.4.3 Sensitivity Analysis Deterministic one -way sensitivity analyses showed the program's cost -effectiveness to be highly sensitive to the PCV13 eff ectiveness against serotype 3, vaccine price, and variables affecting the incidence of CAP (Figure 5 -3). While most analyses resulted in ICERs greater than $100,000/QALY, certain scenarios yielded estimates beneath this threshold. These included scenarios where the proportion of all -cause CAP attributable to S.pneumoniae exceeded 17% (base case: 10.1%), w here the price of PCV13 was below $47 (base case:$75) and when the incidence of CAP was increased by 75% or more. In the base case, we assumed that PCV13 effectiveness was the same against all included serotypes; however, decreases in effectiveness against serotype 3 resulted in a dramatic increase in ICER. In analyses where effectiveness against serotype 3 was assumed to be 50% and 0% of overall effectiveness , the ICER increased to $177,283/QALY and $264,061/QALY respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that all simulations resulted additional health benefits and increased costs (Figure 5-6). The probability of PCV13+PPV23 being cost -effective was 4.2% 36.1% at $50,000 per respectively 5-7). 119 Figure 5-2 Incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICER) by age of vaccination and single vs. multi -cohort models.

At an ICER of $132,886/QALY, adding PCV13 would not be considered to be cost -effective in our base case analysis of vaccinating patients at 65 years of age. Vaccination at older ages only further decreased cost -effectiveness since the quantitative benefits of averted mortality were decreased due to lower life expectancy. These estimates were sensitive to certain key parameter value s, particularly those that affected the rates of CAP attributable to PCV13 serotypes. CAP is a common illness among older adults and a significant contributor to morbidity and mortal ity in this population. Relative to IPD, the incidence of CAP is more than two orders of magnitude larger , resulting in CAP being the primary driver of PCV13's cost-effectiveness, despite lower mortality and treatment costs. The majority of analyses result ed in cost-effectiveness estimates that were above $100,000/QALY, with no single parameter adjustment resulting in estimates below $50,000/QALY. Vaccine -type CAP incidence in the model is primarily determined by (1) the incidence of all -cause pneumonia, ( 2) proportion of all -cause CAP attributable to S.pneumoniae , and (3) the effectiveness of PCV13 against vaccine -type CAP. In particular, the proportion of all -cause CAP attributable to S.pneumoniae had a substantial impact in our analysis. There is conside rable variability in the literature on CAP attributable to S.pneumoniae , which has led to estimates as high as 40 -50% in other cost -effectiveness analyses [182-184]. However, recent data from Canada suggests the attributable proportion is much lower, aligning more closely with data from the Centre for Disease Control's Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study [24,30] . Our base case estimate was 10% based on a Canadian study of inpatient CAP using data from 2014 -2015 [30]. Notably, this 121 demonstrated a dec line from the previous iteration of the study from 2010 -2013 which reported the attributable proportion to be 14% [43]. The proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia attributable to PCV13 serotypes from this study was slightly higher than the proportion from the IPD data used in our analysis; however, when we increased our proportions to match it, the ICER only decreased to $113,713/QALY. The incidence of inpatient all -cause pneumonia was another influential parameter and varied based on the types of ICD -10CA codes used to identify hospitalizations. Broadening the criteria for included hospitalizations to include those with pneumonia coded as a pre -admission comorbidity (as opposed to the most responsible diagnosis), greatly increased the incidence rates recorded for each age group. This higher incidence decreased the ICER to below $100,000/QALY; however, there is considerable uncertainty surro unding these estimates and it is likely that a significant proportion of these hospitalizations are not due primarily to the coded pneumonia diagnosis. Finally, in terms of vaccine effectiveness , the primary source of uncertainty was the degree of protecti on offered against serotype 3. This was particularly relevant as its incidence is larger than all of the other unique PCV13 serotypes combined. A growing body of evidence, including studies showing that serotype 3 has increased or remained stable in both v accinated and unvaccinated cohorts since PCV13 introduction, suggests there may be suboptimal effectiveness against this specific serotype [30,178,179] . These trends were confir med in our IPD datasets for both pediatric and adult cohorts, and as a result we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of assuming decreased effectiveness against serotype 3. We found that if we assumed decreased effectiveness against serotyp e 3, there were substantial increases in the resulting ICERs. In their analysis, Leblanc and colleagues suggested that better protection against serotype 3 may be afforded by direct adult immunization [30]. However, the lack of effect seen in the pediatric population, 122 combined with the documen ted evidence of lower antibody production against serotype 3, suggests this may be unlikely. The success of infant immunization has reduced the prevalence of unique PCV13 serotypes among the older adult population via herd immunity, and when this decline was forecasted further into the future, the ICER increased correspondingly. Although the current decline of PCV13 serotypes mirrors closely the decline of PCV7 serotypes after the vaccine was introduced to the infant immunization program, it remains possib le that the trend for PCV13 serotypes may diverge in years to come. As such, we assumed a number of alternative forecast scenarios to account for the uncertainty in this estimate. Although the majority of forecasts produced similar results to the base case, scenarios where PCV13 serotypes do not continue to decline yielded estimates that are more favourable in terms of the vaccine's cost -effectiveness. While the majority of early analyses suggested that PCV13 would be cost -effective for older adults, more recent analyses that have incorporated the CAPiTA trial data and updated serotype distributions, have suggested that the declining incidence of disease from PCV13 serotypes has eroded the cost -effectiveness of funding PCV13 in older adults [97,176] . Although these analyses were conducted in different regions, their conclusions are relatively similar to ours. In terms of Canadian analyses, a n unpublished study by De Wals and colleagues included in the most recent NACI recomm endation examined the cost -effectiveness for immunocompetent older adults across Canada, and also found PCV13 to be associated with an ICER of $63,318/QALY [23]. However, a more recent analysis by Atwood and colleagues that was funded by the vaccine manufacturer yielded an estimated ICER of $35,484 for vaccinating adults 65 years and older. The difference between this study and our results is primarily due to the fact that Atwood and colleagues attributed a markedly 123 higher proportion of all -cause CAP to PCV13 serotypes and were conducted at a time when the incidence of PCV13 serotypes were at a higher level [22]. Our analysis has several limitations. First, our model was static and did not include unvaccinated cohorts. As a result, we did not incorporate the potential benefits of herd protection achieved via reduced transmission from adults aged 65 and over. Nevert heless, given that the infant PCV13 program has existed for nearly 10 years , the effects of such herd protection are expected to be minimal, particularly given the declining rate of PCV13 serotypes causing disease. Second, we assumed that the serotype dist ribution for pneumococcal CAP was the same as the serotype distribution for IPD. This assumption was necessary due to the lack of recent data on the serotypes causing pneumococcal CAP Ontario, and we assessed the impact of these assumptions in sensitivity analyses . Third, due to a lack of data, we assumed that the proportion of CAP attributable to S.pneumoniae was the same for inpatient and outpatient episodes , given the lack of available data on the attributable proportion in outpatient episodes . Strength s of our study included the use of real -world age -stratified incidence and costing data obtained directly from individually -linked population -based datasets in Ontario. This was supported by up -to-date pneumococcal serotype data taken from across the provi nce to inform the proportion of disease attributable to vaccine serotypes. Nevertheless, our findings may be transferrable to other publicly -funded healthcare systems with similar epidemiology and overall population health status. The substantial indirect protection provided by the infant immunization program represents a n important consideration for the cost -effectiveness of future pneumococcal programs in order to capture the full benefits of an infant immunization program. Given the inter-jurisdictional variability 124 in effect size of indirect protection, using local data is an important consideration to accurately project future trends in disease incidence. 5.6 Conclusion Our analysis indicates that PCV13 is unlikely to be cost -effective for immunocompetent adults 65 years and older due to herd immunity effects through the PCV13 infant immunization program. As a result of the decreasing rate of infection from PCV13 serotype s in the older adult population, the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine for older adults will continue to decrease over time, especially if the suspected lower effectiveness against serotype 3 is confirmed. If a publicly -funded program is considered, monito ring the indirect protection of the infant immunization program on PCV13 serotypes in the older adult population is critically important. 125 5.7 Appendices 5.7.1 APPENDIX A Figure 5-4 Incidence of serogroups among adults 65 years and older from 2007 -2018 in Ontario, Canada based on Public Health Ontario Laboratory data.

By developing an evidence base of data tailored t o the local context, we were able to accurately assess the potential impact of introducing a new vaccination program, as well as provide a foundation for future work in this area. This involved adopting a syndrome -based approach to facilitate generalizabil ity, in addition to employing novel matching strategies to address confounding in our examination of local health administrative data. 6.1.1 Study Summaries 6.1.1.1 Study 1 In the study entitled \"The Impact of Acute Pneumococcal Disease on Health State Utilities : a systematic review\", we synthesized the literature reporting HSU estimates for the acute phase of infection of the four most common syndromes of pneumococcal disease: acute otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis. We identified 26 studies addressing this knowledge gap with the largest number of studies providing H SU estimates for pneumonia. Compared with a recently published review examining multiple aspects of pneumococcal disease, we identified 20 additional studies examining the impact on HRQoL to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the available literature [93]. Furthermore, we were able to identify three studies that estimate d HSU 131 values among a cohort of patients with laboratory -confirmed S. pneumoniae infections , further elucidating the specific impact of pneumococcal disease as a d istinct entity. One of the most salient findings of this review was the marked degree of variability in H SU estimates across all of (range: 0.064 to 0.970). The values reported for each syndrome differed noticeably based on different patient populations and methodologies, leading to challenges in direct comparison s of the estimates for each syndrome . As a resul t, a planned meta -analysis was not feasible given the data available. This also highlighted the challenge of assessing decrements in HRQoL for an acute illness, particularly for direct preference - based measures such as time -trade off and standard gamble, w here there are conceptual challenges to applying these methods as they were originally designed for chronic health states [125,187] . The primar y limitations of the review were the result of feasibility constraints given the fact that we included four distinct syndromes. This required us to limit studies to those published in English and those examining the impact of pneumococcal disease on H SU estimates in the acute phase of the disease , which we defined as up to three months after diagnosis. This may have led us to miss important contributions from authors publishing in other languages , and likely underestimates the full impact of S.pneumoniae given the potential for long -term sequelae. Despite these limitations, the review represents the most comprehensive review to date of the impact of pneumococcal disease on HRQoL, highlighting the substantial heterogeneity in methods and estimates availabl e for these syndromes. 132 6.1.1.2 Study 2 In the study entitled, \" The Attributable Healthcare costs and Epidemiology of Community -Acquired Pneumonia in Ontario, Canada: a population -based cohort study\", we conducted a population -based retrospective matched cohort an alysis of individuals with community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) . This study examined the incidence of disease and healthcare costs attributable to CAP from the Ontario healthcare payer perspective using health administrative data from ICES (ICES houses a repository of individually -linked health service records of residents eligible for publicly funded healthcare in Ontario, Canada ). Exposed subjects were matched to un exposed subjects using a combination of hard and propensity -score matching on a number of key covariates including age, sex, comorbidities and previous healthcare costs. Exposed subjects were found to have substantially higher healthcare costs than comparable unexposed subjects for up to one year post index date , although the majority of costs we re accrued in the first 30 days after infection . Among subjects with inpatient CAP episodes, this excess cost was present up to 3 years after the original index date. The mean attributable costs were $2,256 (95%CI: $2,225 -$2,288 ) -$14,618 ) per inpatient CAP episode . While the attributable cost s of outpatient episodes increased with age, the attributable cost of inpatient episodes was highest among adults aged 18 -64, and lowest among pediatric patients. This appeared to be due to subjects aged 18 -64 years ha ving lower rates of early mortality (within 30 days) compared to adults 65 years and older and hence a longer length of stay in hospital. Inpatient episodes where subjects were admitted to an intensive care unit had higher costs than those who were not, due to higher resource use and longer overall hospital length of stay . In contrast to the majority of studies available examining the economic burden of CAP in Canada, we took advantage of individually -linked health administrative data at ICES to assess longitudinal 133 episodes of care. This is relevant, as for many patients the care provided for an episode of pneumonia is not solely limited to a single hospitalization, but may include additional ambulatory care visits, hospital transfers and readmissions. When these healthcare services are ignored, the number of hospitalizations represents an over -estimate of the number of episodes of care, and a resulting under - estimate of the costs of each episode of care . In addition, we were able to link the costs of outpatient care related to pneumonia to these hospitalizations, providing a more complete picture of the economic burden imposed by CAP. Despite its benefits, health administrative data is limited by the fa ct that it was primarily intended for billing purposes [89,90] . As a result, identifying subjects with infectious diseases in health administrative data poses the risk of misclassification bias due to the non -specific presentation of many conditions [188,189] . This is particularly true in the outpatient setting where the detail available for each visit is more limited and uses an older, less comprehensive ICD system. An additional limitation inherent to matched cohorts is the bias introduced by subjects who go unmatched, as they often represent outliers with extremely high costs. This was observed in our study among the pediatric population, where unmatched exposed subjects tended to have unusually high healthcare costs. Although this cohort represented a small fra ction of the total, we cannot discount that this may have biased our estimates to represent a slight underestimate of attributable costs. Finally, it must be noted that our study evaluated costs attributable to CAP exclusively from the healthcare payer pe rspective and not the societal perspective. Specifically, nonmedical costs such as hospital parking and indirect costs such as loss in productivity were not evaluated. However, given that the most recent guidelines for economic evaluations from the Canadia n Agency for Drugs and 134 Technologies in Health (CADTH) indicated that the reference case analysis should adopt the healthcare payer perspective, this limitation does not adversely affect the goals of informing our economic evaluation [65]. In addition, the future research section (below ) describes how direct nonmedical and indirect costs due to CAP could be determined in future wor k. 6.1.1.3 Study 3 In the study entitled , \"The the Immunocompetent Older Adults (65+) in Ontario, Canada in the Context of Infant Immunization \", we conducted a cost -utility analysis examining the impact of publicly -funding PCV13 for immunocompetent adults 65 years and older, in addition to currently funded 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). Given the variability in incidence, serotype distribution, healthcare system structure between jurisdictions, we sought t o tailor the analysis to local data to ensure our results were as accurate as possible to the Ontario context. The economic evaluation was informed by a microsimulation health state transition model of adults 65 years and older using Ontario -specific incidence and costing data calculated from the data in study 2, as well as the most applicable HRQoL estimates from study 1. The most influential component of the analysis was the serotype -specific laborato ry data from the Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) which describes the changes in serotype distributions and incidence over time. Our analysis found that the addition of PCV13 to the current PPV23 vaccination of adults 65 years and older would res ult in an annual incremental cost of approximately $8 million CAD ($108 per individual), and an incremental benefit of 49 QALYs (0.000686 per individual), based on the current rate of vaccination of this cohort. Most of the health gains result from a decre ase in mortality by 135 averting hospitalized cases of CAP. This resulted in an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) of more than $150,000 CAD/QALY gained, suggesting that it was unlikely to be a cost -effective intervention. The results were driven enti rely by the vaccine's effectiveness against CAP, with IPD having little impact due to its significantly lower incidence. In particular, the model was most sensitive to the proportion of all -cause pneumonia attributable to S.pneumoniae and the effectiveness of PCV13 against serotype 3. The reason behind this was that small changes in the attributable percentage resulted in large absolute changes due to the high incidence of pneumonia in this population. Similarly, serotype 3 is now the most common serotype i solated from IPD patients, and as a result effectiveness against it has a significant impact on reducing disease. However, the growing body of evidence shedding doubt on effectiveness against serotype 3, has significant implications on future planning [30,178,179] . Despite the study's consistent findings across scenario and sensitivity analyses , there were important limitations , including the static nature of the model and the assumptions on serotype distribution . Our model was static and did not include unvaccinated cohorts , therefore it did not consider the potential benefits of herd protection achieved via reduced transmission from adults aged 65 and over. However, given the pre-existing decline in vaccine -type disease observed in Ontario since the introduction of the infant PCV13 program, the effects of such herd protection are expected to be minimal . In terms of the assumptions on serotype distribution , we assumed that the y would be the same in IPD and pneumococcal CAP. This was necessary due to a lack of data, although in a sensitivity analysis that examined the impact of increasing the proportion of CAP caused by vaccine - serotypes, the intervention remained unlikely to be cost-effective. 136 Strengths of the study included the use of real -world age -stratified incidence and costing data obtained directly from individually -linked population -based datasets in Ontario. This was supported by up -to-date pneumococcal serotype data taken from across the province to inform the proportion of disease attributable to vaccine serotypes. 6.1.2 Research Implications The studies included in this thesis sought to address the challenges involved in evaluating a provincial vaccination program through primary studies, systematic review, and the use of local data. In conducting an economic evaluation, it is necessary to synthesize different types of information. This information can be broadly categorized into data assessing projected disease burden, intervention effectiveness , and costing components, which were add ressed by study 1 (Chapter 3) and 2 (Chapter 4) of this thesis. With regards to the systematic review of H SU estimates in study 1 (Chapter 3) , the vast majority of studies adopted a syndrome -based approach, and as a result the extracted data can be readil y applied in future research to interventions targeted at other pathogens causing the same syndromes . Given the significant variability in patient population and numerical value observed for each syndrome's H SU estimates, the review provides a useful summa ry of the available literature which should facilitate selection of the most appropriate estimate s. Recent initiatives such as the Health Utility Book (HUB) Project aim to serve a similar purpose of bringing together H SU estimates in a systematic way at broader scale [190] . However, until these initiatives are implemented at a broader scale, there remains value in systematic asses sments of the H SU literature for specific syndromes. Another aspect of the literature revealed by our review was that there remains a number of challenges in 137 estimating the H SU for temporary health states ; particularly those that span a wide range of sever ity over the disease course . Previous research has pointed towards inconsistency in responses when evaluating health states relevant for vaccines, even with the use of visual aids to assist with comprehension of risk reductions [191] . Although innovative methods such as the chained standard gamble and time trade -off have been developed in recent years, they were rarely used in the studies found in our review, which aligns with the findings of a separate review examining HSU estimates for temporary health states across a number of diseases [192] . This is likely due to the increased cost and complexity of applying these methods in practice, which are also subject to their own methodological limitations [193,194] . In terms of costing components, t he results of study 2 (Chapter 4) can be used to inform physicians, policy makers and researchers on the incidence and attributable costs associated with episodes of CAP. The study provided estimates across all age groups and treatment settings, and as a r esult, the findings can be applied to a host of different interventions targeting CAP . The se cost estimates are particularly valuable in terms of priority setting for health policy, demonstrat ing the magnitude of financial resources that could be redirecte d if the syndrome was averted through a vaccination program or changes in management. The finding that the attributable financial burden of each episode extends past the acute phase of infection correlates well with previous evidence suggesting increased l ong-term mortality and morbidity secondary to episodes of hospitalized CAP and IPD [140,151 -155]. Nevertheless, the reasons for this extended period of increased healthcare utilization likely differ between age groups, and therefore a more targeted analysis is likely required to fully elucidate these findings. This would require a thorough follow -up of specific subpopulation s, including all subsequent hospitalizations and healthcare utilization after recovery from the acute episode, with a comparison to a similar unexposed population . Given the size of the study 138 population, there would be feasibility and methodological challenges in terms of which morbidities to consider and the length of follow -up needed. However, these could be guided by the finding s available in the current literature which point primarily to ongoing respiratory , cardiovascular and neurological sequelae [140,154,155] . An important learning point from the COI analysis of CAP was the challenge in successfully matching the exposed subjects to comparable un exposed subjects to accomplish the goals of the \"net cost\" approach . The CAP pop ulation from this study was significantly larger and more diverse than previous costing studies in Ontario using the same methodology [195-200]. This posed difficulties in terms of obtaining comparable matches across all ages and disease severities. Early iterations of the match, which w ere based on logistic propensity -score m odels including variables related to healt hcare utilization, result ed in a number of unbalanced covariates between matche d pairs , as well as significant discrepancies in matched ages. These issues were initially addressed by hard-matching on age and sex, as well as stratifying the population by treatment setting (outpatient vs. inpatient) and age group (pediatric vs. adult) prior to matching . However, when the healthcare costs prior to the CAP episodes were compared between exposed and un exposed subjects, there remained a substantial difference in the pre-CAP baseline healthcare costs between the matched pairs. Given that the assumption underlying the matching process and \"net cost\" approach is that subtracting the costs of unexposed subjects serves the purpose of accounting for the baseline healthc are utilization of exposed subjects , there was concern that the matched pairs were not serving their intended purpose [83,201,202] . As a result, the decision was made to include pre -CAP healthcare costs directly into the matching p rocess to most accurately address this shortcoming. This option was made possible by the flexibility of the health administrative costing data available in Ontario, which allowed various pre-CAP costing windows to be tested . Previous studies have incorpora ted direct healthcare 139 utilization ( e.g., number of hospitalizations in the year prior to exposure of interest) ; however , few studies to date have been able to directly use the healthcare costs prior to exposure as matching variable [157,203] . The final matching algorithm was able to adequately match all of the pre -CAP baseline var iables, based on minimized standardized differences , facilitating accurate estimate s of pre-CAP healthcare costs. Finally, the economic evaluation of a potential PCV13 program for adults older than 65 (Chapter 5) highlighted the fact that in public health , the context into which a preventive measure is introduced, can have significant consequences on the value provided by the intervention. This includes factors such as the proportion of the targeted disease that can be impacted ( e.g., the local incidence o f vaccine serotypes vs. non -vaccine serotypes), as well as the timing of implementation . Prior to the introduction of the PCV13 infant immunization program, funding the vaccine for routine use among older adults would almost certainly have been considered cost-effective in the short -term. However, given the substantial herd effects from the infant program, the burden of disease in adults has changed so markedly, that funding PCV13 for adults at this point would no longer provide reasonable value for money. Prior to this work, the most recently published article addressing this question in Canada indicated that PCV13 funding would be highly cost -effective for older adults [169] . Published in 2018, the study by Atwood and colleagues was funded by the vaccine manufacturer. The stark divergence of our results is primarily due to the fact that the authors attributed a m arkedly higher proportion of all - cause CAP to PCV13 serotypes . This was partially due to the fact that the analysis was conducted at a time when PCV13 serotypes were circulating at a higher level . This is a valuable insight, as it suggests that for some di seases, there may not be continued value to immunize more than one 140 population at a time. Evidently, this would be highly context dependent, as for certain infectious diseases such as influenza, antigenic drift is such that herd effects can only be achieved through regular multi -cohort immunization [204] . Interestingly, this finding brings into question whether temporary funding of a future PCV vaccine for older adults, in concert with introduction to the infant program, may accelerate the decline in vaccine -type disease. In this way, once vaccine -type infections decline to a certain level among older adults, the herd effects of the infant immunization program may be sufficient to suppress vaccine -type disease in all cohorts. 6.2 Future Research The following proposed studies would be beneficial to research related to pneumococcal disease in Ontario, as well as cost -of-illness studies across other infectious diseases. 6.2.1 Primary study of health state utility values In our review of the impact of pn eumococcal disease on H SU estimates , we identified a number of limitations inherent to the estimates that are currently available in the literature. Although in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of estimates available, with certain studies being particularly high quality, there exists a need for future methodological and applied research into evaluating severe, temporary health states like pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. In particular, the majority of studies evaluating sep sis and meningitis have focused exclusively on long -term H SU value s, primarily at 6 months or 1 year after discharge from hospital [95]. Given the severity of these diseases, it is unlikely that values could be elicited directly from patients during the acute phase of infection. Therefore estimates would need to b e elicited from proxies or from presentation of vignettes that accurately reflect the trajectory of disease [187] . Importantly, many of the studies that 141 used multi -attribute utility instruments such as the EQ -5D, did not also inc lude a control or comparison group of unaffected individuals. While it is common practice to use population values as comparisons, this may not necessarily be representative in all cases, as for infectious diseases like pneumonia, the patients who contract the infection may at baseline have more comorbidities or lower quality of life than the general population. 6.2.2 CAP Costs from the societal perspective In our study of the healthcare costs attributable to CAP, we found a significant increase in healthcare costs among exposed subjects relative to un exposed subjects. However , this study did not address nonmedical costs or indirect costs. More studies are needed to evaluate these impacts as this will facilitate a more comprehensive economic evaluation from the societal perspective that can be used as a non -reference case analys is. To assess these costs, exposed subjects or their caregivers can be interviewed or surveyed to gain a more complete understanding of time off work, out -of-pocket costs and caregiver costs [205] . The challenges involved in collecting this data involve recruiting a represen tative sample, designing questions appropriately to capture all required information and logistical concerns regarding the timing of data collection ( e.g., at what point in illness to ask for interview/survey). 6.2.3 Costs of IPD and Acute Otitis Media Althou gh the COI analysis incorporated into this thesis was limited to CAP due to its particularly important role on the outcomes of the economic evaluation of PCV13 , S.pneumoniae causes a number of other costly syndromes. In particular, acute otitis media and i nvasive pneumococcal 142 disease represent most of the remaining burden attributable to this pathogen. In follow -up studies, there would be value in examining the healthcare costs attributable to these syndromes. Similar methodologies could be applied to ensur e consistency, and for IPD, linking PHOL laboratory data to the health administrative datasets would add value to more accurately identifying cases. In this way, the serotype -specific costs of IPD infection could also be elucidated. The recent linkage of t he Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS), the electronic repository of Ontario's laboratory test results, to the provincial health administrative datasets at ICES will further improve the ability to accurately identify cases in epidemiologic and c osting analyses [206] . In particular, access to the results of fluid cultures will be of value for adopting a pathogen -based approach to costing studies , keeping in mind the limitations regarding sampling bias towards more severe cases of infection. Finally, an important com ponent to be included in future work is the incorporation of equity -relevant variables in addition to income quintiles, which were included in the present analysis. These include identifiers of traditionally disadvantaged populations such as recent immigra nts and indigenous peoples, as well as the recently developed Canadian marginalization index (CAN -Marg) [207] . The CAN -Marg was created to reflect a more complete picture of marginalization based on four dimensions: material deprivation, dependency, ethnic concent ration and residential instability. In this way, more specific estimates of incidence and attributable healthcare costs can be calculated for these populations , and subsequently employed in analyses focusing on potential equity considerations. 143 6.2.4 Cost -Effect iveness Analysis of Future Pneumococcal Vaccine Programs & Interventions Targeting Increased Vaccine Uptake Although the evidence appears to indicate that funding PCV13 for immunocompetent older adults is unlikely to be cost -effective, there are a number of emerging research questions concerning the adult vaccination program. In particular, Merck and Pfizer are currently conducting trials of a 15 -valent and 20 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15 , PCV20 ) which would an addition two and seven strains (22F & 33F ; 8, 10A, serotypes represent a siz eable portion of the outstanding burden of IPD. By examining the trajectory of these serotypes, it will be possible to evaluate the cost -effectiveness of funding this intervention for infants, older adults or both. Based on the results of the analysis pres ented in this thesis, the timing of funding would be critical given the clear herd effects observed from both the PCV7 and PCV13 infant immunization programs . There is an opportunity to further define the potential benefits of an updated vaccine program b y addressing the potential equity improvements attained through implementation . Similar to many other infectious diseases, pneumococcal syndromes are more prevalent in disadvantage d populations, such as isolated northern communities and low socioeconomic s tatus neighbourhoods [211-215]. This is the result of a multifactorial process that often leads to these populations being both more susceptible to infection , as well as more exposed to crowded environments where the likelihood of transmission is increased [216-220]. In recent years, within the field of economic evaluation, increasing attention has been paid to the fact that the goal of maximizing efficiency can come at the expense of equity [221-225]. This is exemplified by the general principle in most evaluations that all QALYs are weighted equally in evaluations , ignoring any distributional inequities . Therefore, an intervent ion that disproportionately accrues additional QALYs to the most affluent members of society, is considered entirely equivalent to an intervention that adds the same number of QALYs to 144 the most disadvantaged members of society. In response, a number of alt ernative approaches have been proposed to address this issue, including equity impact analyses and equity trade -off analyses [224,226] . However, despite these developments, there remains a dearth of explicitly equity - informed analyses in the published literature [225] . In the case of pneumococcal vaccination, by undertaking a formalized equity -informed evaluation, the distributional benefits may present a stronger case for funding routine vaccination under certain assumptions. Similarly, there may also be a case for fund ing vaccination among specific disadvantaged populations, as was done during a 2011 outbreak of IPD in Winnipeg, Manitoba for individuals experiencing homelessness or using intravenous drugs [215] . Using equity -relevant variables and population -based health administrative data as described above (section 6.2.3), these stratified estimates can facilitate this type of equity -informed analyses. 6.2.5 Cost -Effectiveness Analysis of Interventions Targeting Increased Vaccine Uptake In addition to funding a novel vaccine, analyses examining the impact of interventions targeted at improving uptake of PPV23 may provide insight into how to optimize the health benefit s of an intervention that is already funded. The Public Health Agency of Canada ' target for PPV23 uptake among adults older than 65 years by 2025 is 80%; however , uptake has remained at approximately 20% for more than a decade [163] . As a result, there is a case to be made that improving uptake may have more benefit than funding a new intervention , particularly if these efforts are tailored towards populations who have the highest potential to benefit . A we alth of literature exists examining strategies to improve vaccine uptake, and therefore there is opportunity to conduct both a primary 145 pilot study, as well as modeling projections of the potential cost -effectiveness of implementing programs to increase upt ake [227-230] 6.3 Conclusion This aim of this thesis work was to inform public health policy related to pneumococcal vaccination among older adults in Ontario. Infectious diseases present a number of challenges that make them distinct in terms of program evaluation. In particular, the local context into which an intervention is introduced plays a more substantial role, relative to the treatments typically used to manage chronic diseases. As a result, it is critical to tailor evaluations to the jurisdiction s making funding decisions, as findings are less transferable. Vaccination programs are an ideal case study of these issues as they are widespread and costly to implement, and their effectiveness can vary dramatically depending on the environment and interventions already in place. The research comprising this thesis sought to address these challenges through a systematic review , primary studies and the use of accurate local serotype data. In addition to informing the cost -effectiveness analysis outlined in study 3, much of the data der ived can be readily applied to other infectious diseases, and serve to support prospective analyses of infectious disease interventions in Ontario and Canada. Future research that expands the understanding of costs attributable to pneumonia and other pneum ococcal syndromes would be valuable in furthering the understanding of the economic burden of infectious diseases and allow for a more comprehensive analysis of vaccination programs. 146 7 References 1.
