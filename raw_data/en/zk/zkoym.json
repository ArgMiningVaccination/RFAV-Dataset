Using our two sonic powered chopstick wands simultaneously to deliver instantly firmer, plumper, dewy looking skin.", "sitename": "Crystal Clear Skincare", "date": "2019-11-22", "cleaned_text": "Our patented Wand offers truly amazing results; if you are looking for an instant firming and wrinkle-smoothing fix while providing the skin with intense hydration, look no further. The Wand is powered by sonic vibration and rolled all over the face to lift and firm the muscles while dispensing the powerful serum from the roller ball head onto the skin to offer instant hydration. This clever technology offers a double pronged effect; the sonic waves send messages to the nerve ending telling the muscles to contract which stimulates the facial muscles to lift and firm. Simultaneously, the Pharma Grade Hyaluronic Acid projected from the roller ball acts like a magnet to the skin, providing an instant burst of hydration and moisture-binding power. Low molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid penetrates deep into skin, literally infusing moisture and plumping the appearance of lines and wrinkles from the inside out, allowing a fresher, dewier skin to emerge. 60 seconds of rolling the sonic powered wand over the face every morning is a sure way of giving the skin an instant workout. Perfect for addressing dry dehydrated skin, under eye puffiness, loss of skin firmness, lines and wrinkles, droopy eye bows and there is even a special T-bar attachment for use on under eyes the neck and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. By adding to the tip of the WAND and gliding over the skin, eye bags are depuffed and muscles in the neck area tightened, toned and lifted, fighting 'tech neck'. Powered by sonic vibrational technology, the Easy Lift WAND combines sonic vibration with a super strength 98% Hyaluronic serum known for its amazing rehydration and plumping properties and at 98% you really are giving the skin that much needed drink. The serum is automatically released from the rollerball head as you roll the WAND over each side of the face and neck. This unique, double-pronged approach delivers a mega dose of moisture thanks to the high and low molecular weight pharmaceutical grade serum whilst simultaneously lifting, firming and contouring facial muscles through intense facial massage. Featuring two pre-set levels of vibration, one for the delicate skin around the eyes to reduce puffiness and eye bags and one for a more intense vibration for the face, neck and upper brows, the finished skin looks immediately lifted, toned, rehydrated and glowing. The Easy Lift Wand is like having your very own expert Crystal Clear skin treatment anytime, anyplace, anywhere.... Unscrew roller ball heads and pump 3 drops of serum into each roller ball head. Re attach and press switch twice for level 2. Starting on the neck roll up and over a cleansed skin. Repeat several times to encourage that beautiful healthy glow. Gently roll from the inner corner of the eye outwards and hold at the temple for 20 seconds. Repeat the process several times. Repeat the process above the eye and hold under eyebrow for 20 seconds to help firm and create a more wide-awake look. Apply a tiny amount of moisturiser into the palm of your hand and simply pat onto the skin.
