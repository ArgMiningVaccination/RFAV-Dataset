All payments made by the Program to providers shall be considered as payment in full for services rendered and no additional charge shall be made by the provider to any person for covered services. Acceptance of payment from the patient or patient's family in addition to payments made by the Program constitutes an Ov@~A~nt which is in violation of Federal and State regulations. PHYS:rC:IAHS' SBRV:ICBS U:IKBtrR.SmmNT The fee schedule for physicians' services lists the CPT-4 codes used by the Program and the maximum fee paid for each coded procedure. A provider using CPT terminology and coding selects the procedure or service that most accurately identifies the service performed. Any service or procedure should be adequately documented in the medical record. Providers must maintain such records as are necessary to document fully the services provided. The records must be retained for six year.. Lack of acceptable documentation may cause the Program to deny payment or, if payment has already been made, to request repayment, or to impose sanctions, which may include withholding of payment or suspension or removal from the Program. Payment for services is based upon the procedure code (s) selected by the provider. Although some providers delegate the task of assigning codes, the accuracy of the claim is solely the provider's responsibility and is subject to audit. PREAUTBOR:IZATION ~. Some physician services within the fee schedule require preauthorization. Preauthorization is required for the following procedures or services: .. Cosmetic Surgery - to correct a congeni tal or acquired anomaly will be preauthorized when there is documentation that the anomaly represents a significant deviation from the normal state and affects the patient's health to a degree that it impairs his or her abili ty to function in society, b. Contact lens evaluation aDd fitting - when there is medical justification, c. LipectCDy and paDDiculectCDy - when there is an abnormal amount of redundant skin and subcutaneous tissue and that this is causing significant health problems in the patient, d. All evaluations, procedures aDd treatment related in any way to sex reassignment - when the patient is enrolled in a Sexual Behaviors Consultation Program and/or Gender Identity Clinic recognized by the Program and the patient is transsexual which impairs his or her ability to function in society (also applies to e. and f. below), ,I10 e. Medical A88i.tance pre.criptio~ aDd injection. for female females, g. Transplantati0D8 of vital org~ - when more conservative forms of treatment have failed, Service. rendered to an inpatient before ODe preoperative h. day, and i. Surgical procedure. for the treatment of morbid obe.ity - preauthorization criteria include: 1) the patient is at least 100 !bs. overweight or loot over ideal body weight, whichever is less, 2) the obesity is of at least three year's duration, 3) there is a history of serious but futile attempt. at weight reduction under medical supervi.ion, 4) there is an absence of any correctable endocrinopathy which might contribute to obesity and , 5) a psychiatric evaluation is performed to determine the stability of the patient in terms of tolerating the operative procedure and post-operative 8equelae. 2. Services which have been determined by Medicare to be ineffective. unsafe. or without proven clinical value are generally presumed to be not medically necessary. but will be preauthorized if the provider can satisfactorily document medical necessity in a particular case. These services are found in the Medicare Carriers Manual. Part 3. Claims Process. Chapter II. Coverage Is..~es App-~di-~. 3. The Program will preauthorize .ervices when the provider 8Ubmits adequate documentation de1lK>nstrating that the service is both D.8C...ary and appropriate. \"Necessary\" means directly related to diagnostic, preventive, curative, palliative or rehabilitative treatment. -Appropriate\" mea~s an effective service that can be provided, taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the recipient and the relative cost of any alternative services which could be uaed for the .a.- purpose.

(DHMB 4523) 21203 Specific documentation must be attached to the preauthorization request form which includes but is not limited to the following: &. Complete narrative justification of the procedure (s) b. Brief history and phy8ical exam, c. Re8ult of pertinent ancillary studies if applicable, d. Pertinent medical evaluations ~d consultations if applicable. and],], Hot.: Preauthorization for contact lens evaluation and fitting should be submitted on the request form for Vision Care Services DHMH 4546. For all written requests for preauthorization, the phY8ician will receive written notification of the Program 18 decision. If the request is approved, a preauthorization number will be given. This number must be entered in Block 23 of the HCFA-~500 claim form when billing for the service. Authorizations are valid for only 60 days from the date of the letter of approval. Program approval of preauthorization requests only relates to the medical necessity of providing the service descrLbed in the written request. The approval is not a verification of the patient I s eligibility for Medical Assistance. 4. Preauthorization must be obtained prior to making any arrangements for sending a patient out-of-state to a non-contiguous state for ~l~~~i v~ services. Contiguous states are those which surround the State of Maryland. They are: Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia and Wa8hiDgton, D.C. Referrals to these four states and Washington, D.C. do not require an out-of-state preauthorization. They may, however, require preauthorization for other reasons, such as, for organ transplants. 5. Preauthorization normally required by the Program is waf. ved when the service is covered and approved by Medicare. However, if the entire or any part of a claim is rej ected by Medicare, and the claim is referred to the Program for payment, pa~t will be made for services covered by the Program only if authorization for those services has been obtained before billing. Please refer to Program regulations OCMAR ~o. 09.02 and current guidelines and/or transmittals for additional information on services requiring preauthorization.

URL:ISTBD KBD:IC:ID OR SURGERY PROCBDURBS It is recognized that there may be .~cific services or procedures performed by physiciana' services providers that are not found in CPT. Therefore, certain CPT code numbers ending in .\". have been designated for reporting unlisted procedures. When an ~isted procedure number is used, the service o~ procedure must be described by an attached report to the invoice.

Attached reports unlst be legibl~ and must be k~~d to the unlisted procedure code{s) on the BCP'A-1.S00. An alpha or numeric indicator on the claim form beside the procedure code should be keyed to the corre8ponding section or page of the report with the same indicator to facilitate man11al review and valuation. USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES Providers muat bill the Program their usual and custceary charge to the general public for 8imilar 8ervice8, AX~Apt for, injectable drug8, the provision of diagno8tic or therapeutic radiopharmaceutica18, and supplies, in which case, providers must bill their acqui8ition cost.
