Patients often ask us what toxins are released after a chiropractic adjustment, and we answer this based more on how they feel rather than on literature that confirms our belief. The theory is important, but toxic release may or may not happen after chiropractic treatment. The belief that [chiropractic adjustments](https://www.drosland.com/articles/what-is-chiropractic) release toxins is based on nausea a small percentage of people feel after the adjustment. It relates to the toxin release discussion following many [massage therapy](https://www.drosland.com/articles/massage-therapy-and-chiropractic-care) when patients had tight muscles. This theory also needs more scientific data to determine its validity as a toxic release symptom. Understanding Toxin Release and Spinal Manipulation This article serves to explore the topic of toxins and chiropractic care. We will examine the origins of this myth and present our feelings about this theory. We hope to provide our patients and readers better understand why they may feel discomfort after the adjustment. After reading this article, you will better understand how the body eliminates toxins and why toxin release is vital for your overall health. As always, we aim to promote evidence-based chiropractic care and be transparent about what we know to be accurate and hope to be true. What Are Toxins? Toxins result from metabolic processes that stem from various sources such as food, water, air, and (yikes) chemicals. Our body naturally produces toxins, but others are introduced through not-so-natural external sources. How the body eliminates toxins There are several ways we reduce and/or eliminate toxins. We remove toxins through urination, defecation, sweating, and breathing. The kidney and the liver are crucial for removing toxins in the body, and when these organs do not function properly, toxin build-up can occur. The lymphatic system also helps remove toxins and is perhaps where the idea of chiropractic toxin release finds its origins. Chiropractors make lymphatic drainage a part of their service through various tools and tactics. The Body Detoxification System Our liver is responsible for many amazing things, including processing and eliminating toxins from our bodies. By neutralizing harmful substances into less toxic compounds, the body can quickly and efficiently remove them through urination or defecation. We can also count on the kidneys to involve themselves in detoxification by filtering waste products from our blood, excreting them through our urine. As mentioned, the lymphatic system also assists in detoxification by transporting lymph fluid that contains waste products to the lymph nodes at this point. They are neutralized and eliminated from our bodies. Our body is an incredible work of art. Its ability to go through complex processes to eliminate waste and toxins from our bodies is nothing less than a miracle. While various methods exist to support natural detoxification, nothing compares to the body's ability to do it independently. Support it with nutrients and exercise, and you are well on keeping toxins in check. So Where Does This Theory Come From? While the theory may have come through chiropractic care or the early days of chiropractic care, it reached the mainstream when it became a marketing strategy for chiropractors, overly promoting its possibilities. It was an effective way to make those people who felt a little different after the adjustment better about the feeling. Why Does This Theory Get So Much Attention? Detox is a buzzword that is associated with weight loss. And anything that has to do with losing weight will undoubtedly spread to other areas of health. There are even those who seek chiropractic care for the sole reason that they feel it will remove potential toxins from their body. We should state that patients should visit our office mainly for spinal manipulation, stimulating the nervous system, improving posture, as a pain treatment, and for spinal misalignment. We rely on evidence-based information and hope our patients do as well. Chiropractic care can be a safe and effective treatment for many symptoms, and while we hope toxin release proves to be scientifically backed in the future, right now, we will focus on what is proven through research. Conclusion In summary, scientific evidence does not support the myth that toxins are released after a chiropractic adjustment. The body has natural mechanisms for eliminating toxins; chiropractic adjustments do not play a significant role. Belief in this myth can contribute to misinformation about health, potential patient harm, and distrust in evidence-based medicine. Overall, patients should be encouraged to ask questions, seek out reliable sources of information, and rely on evidence-based healthcare when making decisions about their health and wellness. Chiropractic care can be a safe and effective treatment for many conditions. Still, it is crucial to separate fact from fiction and make informed decisions based on reliable information.
