April 22, 2021 OPEN - CONSENT -E-1Spinal Cord Injuries and Congenital or Acquired Disease Processes Research Program The 91st General Assembly enacted legislation (HB 218 and HB 302, 2001) to provide support for a program of research projects that promote and advance knowledge in the areas of spinal cord injuries and congenital or acquired disease processes. As part of this legislation, there was created in the state treasury a \"Spinal Cord Injury Fund\" from which annual appropriations are to be made for the use of the Board of Curators of the University of Missouri. The primary source of money for this fund is a surcharge of two dollars levied on certain costs in criminal cases including violations of any county ordinance or any violation of criminal or traffic laws of the state. The research grants funded by these appropriations are to be awarded by the Board of Curators to investigators who are affiliated with a public or private educational, health care, voluntary health association or research institution, based on the recommendations of an Advisory Board appointed by the Board of Curators for this purpose. Individual awards ($100,000 per year) shall expire at the end of one or two years. The objective of the grants is to obtain preliminary data to test hypotheses and to enable investigators to develop subsequent competitive applications for long-term funding from other sources. The research projects are to be conducted in Missouri. \"Congenital\" spinal cord abnormalities include birth defects affecting the spinal cord such as spina bifida. In addition to traumatic injuries to the spinal cord that lead to paralysis, \"acquired\" abnormalities could include Friedreich's ataxia, which manifests itself in teenage years and appears to run in families, and paralysis due to multiple sclerosis, polio, etc. Approximately 450,000 people in the United States have sustained traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI), with approximately 11,000 new cases of SCI in the US every year. The majority (78%) of SCI victims are males. Most of the injuries result from motor vehicle accidents (50%), falls (24%), violence (11%), or sports injuries (9%). The action requested of the Board is to approve funding for two research proposals approved by the Spinal Cord Injury Advisory Board.

ABSTRACT: Joan Coates, DVM, MS, DACVIM-Neurology Differential expression analysis, at single cell resolution, of the dorsal horn of the thoracic spinal cord to investigate early onset proprioceptive deficits in a canine ALS model Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS) is a nervous system disease that affects people that are middle aged or older. The symptoms are varied, but in most cases muscle weakness starts at a focal point and spreads relentlessly to include most of the voluntary throughout the body. ALS patients seldom live more than four years after their disease has been diagnosed. It is estimated that one in every 400 people alive today in the USA will die from ALS, unless an effective therapy is developed. Although ALS has been intensely researched over the last 40years, no effective treatments have been found. Much of this research was done with genetically modified mice. The failure of this research to yield effective treatments may stem in part from the vast mouse-versus- people differences in body size, life expectancy, and complexity of the nervous system. Thus, we believe the ALS research would greatly benefit from the availability of a large- animal disease model that bridged this mouse-versus-human gap. Furthermore, we believe that canine degenerative myelopathy (DM), an ALS-like disease that commonly affects dogs over seven years of age, is an ideal candidate to fill this gap. Although dogs with DM are euthanized or die because of their voluntary muscle weaknesses, their earliest clinically detectable abnormality is a hind-limb incoordination that is noticeable when the dogs walk and caused a deficiency in their sensory nervous system. We will focus on changes in cells and molecules in the spinal cord that may be responsible for this sensory defect. II. ABSTRACT: David Schulz, PhD Effects of Spinal Cord Injury on Autonomic Network Activity Controlling Bladder Function The leading cause of death after spinal cord injury (SCI) is genitourinary disease which accounts for up to 24.3% of deaths in SCI patients. SCI impairs voluntary control of the bladder, and results in symptoms that include incomplete voiding of the bladder, residual urine remaining in the bladder after urination, and greatly increased risk of urinary tract infections and kidney damage as a result. Therefore, the goal of our proposal is to understand the changes that occur in the nerves and neural networks that supply the bladder, and then use this information to specifically target early therapy in the hopes of improving long-term bladder recovery after SCI. The difficulty in treating bladder dysfunction is that multiple aspects of bladder control are lost, and/or changing as a result of the injury -but those changes are distinct from the direct injury itself. By understanding how activity changes in the networks that supply electrical input to the bladder, we can then use this information to apply early neurostimulation to preserve the bladder system in a state that more resembles the uninjured state, so that there exists a April 22, 2021 OPEN - CONSENT -E-5more complete and well understood substrate to apply treatment to. This will enhance the efficacy of existing treatment (e.g. sacral neuromodulation) and allow for the design of newer and more effective treatment to restore bladder function, improving quality of life -and preventing potentially serious complications -for the SCI patient population.

OPEN - CONSENT - F-3 April 22, 2021330.100 Evaluation of the Ability to Work Executive Order No. 42, issued 12/18/2014, Amended 7-28-20; Bd. Min XX-XX-21. A. Purpose : This policy addresses the standard and process and criteria to be used when determining what actions are appropriate with respect towhether a faculty member , either regular or non-regular, who may beis unable to perform the essential functions of the faculty member's position because of a medical condition and whether a faculty appointment should be terminated for medical reasons. Issues concerning interpretation and application of this policy are to be addressed in the review and determination process stated in this policy and are not subject to further review under the Academic Grievance Procedure in Section 370.010 of the Collected Rules and Regulations. , despite reasonable accommodations. This policy applies, and can be implemented, only in those situations in which observable conduct has raised a serious concern as to whether a faculty member is able to perform the faculty member's essential functions. In accordance with the process and criteria described below, the faculty member may be referred for a fitness for duty evaluation. Application of this policy is not intended as a substitute for other University policies or procedures related to performance, including those imposed because of clinical or professional requirements. In addition, application of this policy is not a substitute for discipline or action taken because of performance deficiencies unrelated to ability. B. Scope : This policy is applicable applies to faculty members, either regular or non- regular tenure/tenure track or non-tenure track, described in Section 310.020A of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri as holding academic staff appointments. This policy is intended to be consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Missouri Human Rights Act and should be interpreted to assure compliance with those mentionedthese laws. C. Special Considerations for Faculty Members: Faculty members have rights that stem from the University's Collected Rules and Regulations, from the application of the general principles of academic freedom, and from the role of faculty members in the shared governance structure within the University of Missouri. This policy is not intended to compromise this special status but rather is intended to clarify and protect the rights of such faculty members and of the University of Missouri and its constituents. D. Rights and Obligations of Faculty Members: 1. Faculty members shall incur no loss of pay or benefits solely because the evaluation process discussed below is underway until and unless official action is taken to alter the faculty member's employment status in conformity with other provisions of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri. 2. Nothing in this policy overrides rights provided to faculty members and others with academic staff appointments under the Collected Rules and Regulations or other applicable contracts, including the right to grieve or appeal the application of this policy under the existing Academic Grievance Procedure found in Section 370.010 of the Collected Rules and Regulations. Grievances do not stop the evaluation of the ability to work process. Grievances against this process must be carried out after the evaluation of the ability to work has concluded ..Faculty OPEN - CONSENT - F-4 April 22, 2021members subject to the evaluation of ability to work process have an obligation to act in good faith and cooperate with the a dministrative coordinator. Failure to attend a reasonably scheduled evaluation may justify disciplinary action and may be considered sufficient evidence to conclude that the faculty member cannot continue to fulfill the terms and conditions of the individual's faculty appointment. Upon a faculty member's failure to attend a reasonably scheduled evaluation, the administrative coordinator will notify the provost, the provost will make a determination as to the faculty member's ability to work, and the process will move forward as stated in section F.3 below. E. Rights and Obligations of the University: 1. The costs of the fitness for duty evaluations by the health care providers professionals designated by the University and the associated costs will be borne by the University, and not by the faculty member. 2. If the outcome of the evaluation is Able to Work with Limitations (see Section F.3. Procedures below) the University shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate those limitations in accordance with Section 600.080 of the Collected Rules and Regulationsif it can do so without undue hardship . F. Procedures: 1. Evaluation: A faculty member of the University may be required to be examined by appropriate licensed/certified health care professional(s) designated by the University in order to determine the faculty member's ability to perform the essential functions of the assigned duties and responsibilities the faculty member's position . Such an evaluation may be required when the campus Provostprovost, in consultation with the appropriate academic unit head, the chief campus human resources administrator and a representative of the Office of the General Counsel, determines that the faculty member's documented job performance or conduct verif, reviewed by the faculty panel described in F.2.a below, gives there is reasonable cause to believe that a physical or mental condition may be adversely affecting the faculty member's ability to perform essential functions of the faculty member's position is impaired by a medical condition, duties or that the faculty member may be posesing a direct threat to the health or safety of the faculty member self or others due to a medical condition . In cases where a threat to health or safety of the faculty member or others may exist, the faculty member will be suspended with pay pending the outcome of the evaluation and any appeals. business 2. Process: The head of the academic unit dean of the faculty member's college or school or their the dean's designee may request that this policy be invoked for a particular faculty member by notifying the campus Pprovost of the documented facts suggesting a need for such an evaluation. When reasonably possible, attempts should be made Attempts must be made to resolve the problem at the level at which the University faculty member carries out primary professional duties, normally the unit in which the faculty member is appointed. These procedures are not intended to prevent the faculty member OPEN - CONSENT - F-5 April 22, 2021or the academic unit head from seeking other recourse as provided by the Collected Rules and Regulations. The campus provost, in consultation with the appropriate academic unit head, the chief campus human resources administrator and a representative of the Office of the General Counsel, will determine whether an evaluation is warranted based on the standard stated in F.1. above. a. The provost will seat a n evaluation panel composed of aA Provost's provost's designee, along with the dean or designee of the school or college where the faculty member holds an appointment, and two tenured faculty members appointed by the chair of the campus faculty senate or council, including at least one faculty member from the same school or college as the faculty member whose fitness for duty evaluation is being sought., will comprise an \"evaluation panel\" to The panel will review the request ensuring that and make a recommendation as to whether the academic unit head has documented demonstrated 1) that an inability to perform the essential functions of the faculty member's job may exist that an evaluation is warranted based on the standard stated in F.1. above, 2) that the academic unit and the faculty member have been involved in efforts to resolve the problem, and 3) that a mutually satisfactory resolution has not been achieved. The panel will reach a recommendation by vote. In the event of an evenly split vote, the panelists may issue their own recommendations along with the reasons for them. If the provost determines an evaluation is warranted, the provost will appoint an administrative coordinator to facilitate the evaluation process. The administrative coordinator will have knowledge of applicable privacy rules and policies and will have appropriate resources to ensure that charges associated with the evaluation are paid by the University. The administrative coordinator, in consultation with the General Counsel's office, will take the following steps: Advise the academic unit on the preparation of background documents Administrative coordinator will receive HIPAA training available from the University. Administrative coordinator will have access to a One Card and MoCode for charges resulting from fitness of duty evaluations. a. Inform the faculty member in writing that an evaluation is required and provide information on the faculty member's and University's rights and obligations under this policy. . b. Prepare a list of three to five health care professionals, at least one of whom is not employed by the University, for the evaluation process . OPEN - CONSENT - F-6 April 22, 2021a. The faculty member to be evaluated, or in the event that the faculty member is unable or unwilling, an authorized representative with legal authority to make health-care decisions for the faculty member to be evaluated, shall select from the list the health-care professional(s) to perform the evaluation. b. If the faculty member to be evaluated or the faculty member's authorized representative has not selected the health-care professional(s) to perform the evaluation within two weeks following receipt of the list of health- care professionals, the coordinator will select the health- care professional(s) to perform the evaluation and inform the faculty member to be evaluated of the selection. c. Inform the faculty member of the time and place of the required evaluation. d. Gather and assemble the evaluation materials and present them to the provost. In cases where a direct threat to health or safety of the faculty member or others may exist, the faculty member will be suspended with pay by the provost pending the outcome of the evaluation.

Purpose : This policy addresses the standard and process to be used when determining whether a faculty member is unable to perform the essential functions of the faculty member's position because of a medical condition and whether a faculty appointment should be terminated for medical reasons. Issues concerning interpretation and application of this policy are to be addressed in the review and determination process stated in this policy and are not subject to further review under the Academic Grievance Procedure in Section 370.010 of the Collected Rules and Regulations. Application of this policy is not intended as a substitute for other University policies or procedures related to performance, including those imposed because of clinical or professional requirements. In addition, application of this policy is not a substitute for discipline or action taken because of performance deficiencies unrelated to ability. B. Scope : This policy applies to faculty members, either tenure/tenure track or non-tenure track, described in Section 310.020A of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri as holding academic staff appointments. This policy is intended to be consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Missouri Human Rights Act and should be interpreted to assure compliance with these laws. C. Special Considerations for Faculty Members: Faculty members have rights that stem from the University's Collected Rules and Regulations, from the application of the general principles of academic freedom, and from the role of faculty members in the shared governance structure within the University of Missouri. This policy is not intended to compromise this special status but rather is intended to clarify and protect the rights of such faculty members and of the University of Missouri and its constituents. D. Rights and Obligations of Faculty Members: 1. Faculty members shall incur no loss of pay or benefits solely because the evaluation process discussed below is underway until and unless official action is taken to alter the faculty member's employment status in conformity with provisions of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri. 2. Faculty members subject to the evaluation of ability to work process have an obligation to act in good faith and cooperate with the administrative coordinator. Failure to attend a reasonably scheduled evaluation may justify disciplinary action and may be considered sufficient evidence to conclude that the faculty member cannot continue to fulfill the terms and conditions of the individual's faculty appointment.

Such an evaluation may be required when there is reasonable cause to believe that the faculty member's ability to perform essential functions of the faculty member's position is impaired by a medical condition, or that the faculty member poses a direct threat to self or others due to a medical condition. 2. Process: The dean of the faculty member's college or school or the dean's designee may request that this policy be invoked for a particular faculty member by notifying the campus provost of the facts suggesting a need for such an evaluation. The campus provost, in consultation with the appropriate academic unit head, the chief campus human resources administrator and a representative of the Office of the General Counsel will determine whether an evaluation is warranted based on the standard stated in F.1. above. a.

As a member of his/her institution, the professor seeks above all to be an effective teacher and scholar. Although he/she observes the stated regulations of the institution, provided they do not contravene academic freedom, he/she maintains his/her right to criticize and seek revision. He/she determines the amount and character of the work he/she does outside his/her institution with due regard to his/her paramount responsibilities within it. When considering the interruption or termination of his/her service he/she recognizes the effect of his/her decision upon the program of the institution and gives due notice of his/her intentions. d. As a member of his/her community, the professor has the rights and the obligations of any citizen. He/she measures the urgency of those obligations in the light of his/her responsibilities to his/her subject, OPEN - CONSENT - I-5 April 22, 2021to his/her students, to his/her profession, and to his/her institution. When he/she speaks or acts as a private person he/she avoids creating the impression that he/she speaks or acts for his/her college or university. As a citizen engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, the professor has a particular obligation for promoting conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. Further, the faculty accepts the responsibility of monitoring its own members if accepted standards of professional responsibility are abrogated (Section 300.010.L of these Bylaws). 3. Authority -- The faculty's authority, as delegated by the Board of Curators, is of three types: direct and primary, in which the faculty has essential decision-making authority; shared, in which the faculty participates with others; and advisory, in which the faculty counsels with the person or offices with ultimate decision-making authority. (On those matters requiring multi-campus coordination, the faculty shall act through its appropriate bodies, Section 300.010.F.) a. Primary and Direct Authority -- The UMC faculty has essential decision-making authority in matters directly affecting the educational program of UMC, including but not limited to: (1) Articulation and maintenance of standards of academic performance -- this includes but is not limited to guidelines for appropriate research, service, and scholarships; requirements for graduation; and related matters.

E. Faculty Organization OPEN - CONSENT - I-8 April 22, 20211. The authority of the faculty as delegated by the Board of Curators shall include the responsibilities set forth in Section 300.010.C. In order to perform these functions, the faculty takes cognizance of the consequences of its size and complexity and therefore delegates specific policy making and coordinating functions to representative bodies. The main representative body shall be a Faculty Council. 2. The Faculty Council is established as the elected representative body of the faculty. It shall act for the general faculty on all matters within the framework of the policies expressed in these Bylaws and shall function in accordance with the specifications formulated in Section 300.010.C. The Faculty Council shall have the right to delegate some of its operation tasks to an executive committee and/or its officers. 3. The Faculty as a whole shall approve all policies which involve a modification or change of the principles set forth in these Bylaws. The faculty further may review decisions and actions by the Faculty Council provided that a petition requesting such action has been signed by at least 25 faculty members representing at least three divisions of the campus. 4. There shall be a Graduate Faculty organization. It shall develop its own criteria for membership, organizational structure, its own obligations and rights providing they are consonant with the philosophy and principles of the federal faculty Bylaws. The Graduate Faculty shall determine the functions of the Graduate Faculty Senate. The Graduate Faculty shall set standards for graduate education on the campus, provided they meet at least the minimum standards established by the general faculty. 5. Divisional faculties are established in the various academic divisions. They shall develop policies adapted to their specific needs, but standards of performance must not be set below those established by the general faculty. 6. Establishment of new divisions shall entitle them to representation where divisional representation is designated in these Bylaws or otherwise deemed appropriate. F. Faculty Participatory Authority and Functions in Campus Governance 1. Participatory authority and functions of the faculty are expressed through faculty involvement in the campus committee structure including those committees which govern academic and administrative matters affecting the campus, faculty and students. The faculty participates in the selection of administrative officers. The faculty participates in the monitoring of administrative and academic operating procedures. These participatory functions of the faculty are articulated as follows: a. The faculty, through its elected representative structure, the Faculty Council, nominate faculty members to participate in a specially designated body currently called the University Assembly which is charged with advising the chancellor on matters mutually affecting all constituencies of the University (faculty, students, administration, and non-academic OPEN - CONSENT - I-9 April 22, 2021employees), and nominating members to campus- wide standing committees. The participation of the UMC faculty in this Assembly will represent faculty participation to the extent that the domains of faculty primary and direct authority are not infringed upon. b. An Academic Regulations Committee shall be established consisting of representatives of the Faculty Council (which may be the Executive Committee) and campus administration. This committee will assume responsibility for the development and monitoring of campus standard operating guidelines which, after approval by the Faculty Council, administration, and students where appropriate, shall be published as \"Academic Regulations Manual.\" These guidelines will cover the academic schedule of studies and examinations, calendar, academic procedures and policies and campus governance and shall be consonant with these Bylaws. This committee will meet regularly to monitor these guidelines and to coordinate the need for modification and changes. c. The Faculty Council will nominate faculty members to participate in ad hoc committees, including Search and Screening Committees for campus administrators and academic officers. 2. The faculty representatives to the University Assembly and the Academic Regulations Committee will report to the Faculty Council at appropriate intervals. G. Faculty Participation in University-wide Governance 1. The faculty shall participate in education policy determination about those matters which are University-wide; some of these will be parallel to those issues in which the faculty exercises shared authority at the campus level (Section 300.010.C.3.a). The faculty's responsibility in these matters shall be exercised through mechanisms such as: a. The Intercampus Faculty Council on which the UMC faculty shall have representatives designated by the UMC Faculty Council. b. The University Doctoral Council to which the UMC Graduate Faculty shall elect its members. c. Ad hoc and standing University-wide committees to which the faculty (often acting through its elected campus body, the Faculty Council) shall designate its members. d. Intercampus committees concerned with cooperation in educational and research activities within the respective disciplines. H. Faculty Council on UMC Policy OPEN - CONSENT - I-10 April 22, 20211. Representative Faculty Voice: A Faculty Council shall be composed of faculty members who shall be elected by the several divisional faculties as hereinafter provided. The Faculty Council shall have certain delegated authority to act on behalf of the General Faculty (Section 310.010.C.3.c of these Bylaws). In addition, the Council, as a representative faculty voice, shall advise the chancellor and the UMC faculty on questions of UMC policy submitted by either to the Council, and may initiate recommendations concerning changes in the UMC policy for consideration and appropriate action by the chancellor or UMC faculty. 2. Academic Unit Selections: All colleges and schools that are headed by a dean who reports to the provost for academic affairs shall be entitled to voting representation. For the purposes of Academic Unit Selections MU Libraries will be collectively treated as a school entitled to voting representation. 2. The minimum T/TT number of representatives on the Council shall be 25 and the maximum shall be 30. Four additional representatives on the Council shall be NTT faculty. 3. Allocation of Representatives: Faculty Representatives for T/TT faculty shall be allocated to a college or school on the basis of the total number of full-time ranked T/TT faculty members of the UMC faculty within the college or school. The determination of the number of full-time ranked T/TT faculty representatives shall be made on November 1 of each academic year, and the number so determined shall govern representation for the next academic year. A full-time ranked T/TT representative who has a joint appointment in two or more colleges or schools shall be assigned to the college or school in which he/shethe representative devotes the largest percentage of his/her the representative's time. If the assignment cannot be made on this basis, the Council shall make the assignment, first having consulted with the representative T/TT faculty member to the extent feasible. Representation of the various colleges and schools shall be based upon persons holding the three eligible ranks listed in the most recent UMC general catalog. Emeritus professors and any academic titles other than professors, associate professors, assistant professors will not be included in the computations, with the exception that retired professors on continued service will be counted. Each college or school shall be entitled to representation at a basic ratio of one representative for each fifty (50) full-time ranked T/TT faculty members or majority fraction thereof (26-49), and in particular as follows: one (1) representative for 1-75; two (2) representatives for 76-125; and so on for each additional fifty (50) full-time ranked T/TT faculty or major fraction thereof. Notwithstanding the basic ratio, no school or college is entitled to more than eight representatives. Commented [DC1]: Not amended Commented [DC2]: This includes MU Libraries as an academic unit for faculty census and representation even though not a \"school or college headed by a dean.\" Commented [DC3]: The old rule focused on T/TT Faculty within each school or college. The new rule is expanded to all \"full-time ranked faculty members.\" Commented [DC4]: This portion is a bit confusing, but it has worked for many years and so we didn't want to change it. The basic setup is that <75 faculty - 1 rep 75-125 faculty - 2 rep 126-175 - 3 rep ... The actual number used each year is adjusted to keep the size of Council 30-35. Commented [DC5]: To keep a balanced faculty council, the cap is added to limit size to 8. With our current faculty size, this would only apply to the School of Medicine. OPEN - CONSENT - I-11 April 22, 2021In the event the number of full-time ranked T/TT faculty members changes to the point where the basic ratio of one to 50 would give less than 25 30 or more than 30 35 representatives, the Council by a finding recorded in its minutes shall adjust the ratio to produce not less than 25 30 and not more than 30 35 T/TT faculty representatives. 4. Minimum Number of T/TT and NTT Representatives: The minimum number of T/TT faculty representatives on the Council shall be four, and the minimum number of NTT faculty representatives on Council shall be four. If, as the result of academic unit selections of representatives, fewer than four NTT faculty or four T/TT faculty are included in the makeup of Faculty Council on September 15 of any year, Faculty Council shall organize and hold a special election of the respective full-time ranked NTT or T/TT faculty to achieve the minimum. Only full-time ranked NTT faculty will vote in a special election for an NTT representative; Only full-time ranked T/TT faculty will vote in a special election for a T/TT representative. The selected representatives will be added to the Faculty Council in addition to those chosen by the academic unit selections, and their addition may increase the size of Faculty Council to more than 35 full-time faculty ranked faculty representatives. Representatives elected in special elections will serve regular three-year terms. 4. T/TT Faculty Council representatives must be elected from among the T/TT faculty members of the UMC faculty. 5. Every T/TT faculty member of the UMC faculty is eligible for election to and service on the Council: Provided, however, that m Limitation on Administrative Members: Members of the UMC faculty who hold administrative positions with the rank of assistant dean or higher, or equivalent positions regardless of the title, are ineligible for election or service. Only those eligible to serve on the Faculty Council as T/TT full-time ranked faculty are eligible to vote for full-time ranked T/TT representatives on the Council. 6. Election Procedures: The T/TTfull-time ranked faculty of each college or school shall determine the election procedures for the election of its T/TT representative or representatives and shall report these to the Faculty Council. Election shall be by secret ballot. In those divisions that have two or more representatives, terms shall be staggered. 7. Full-time ranked NTT faculty campus-wide will elect four members of Faculty Council, one each from the categories of teaching, research, clinical and extension. UMC NTT faculty shall determine the election procedures for the election of NTT representatives and shall report these to the Faculty Council. Every NTT faculty is eligible for election to and service on the Council and only NTT faculty shall vote in election of NTT Faculty Council representatives. T/TT Matters: As defined in the Faculty Council Rules of Order, Commented [DC6]: Faculty Council has power to change the ratio as the school population shifts. Commented [DC7]: Special elections if <4 NTT or <4 T/TT faculty are elected from the academic unit selection. Commented [DC8]: This limitation was already in place, but now clearly applies also all faculty, not just T/TT. OPEN - CONSENT - I-12 April 22, 2021NTT faculty representatives are not eligible for service on the Faculty Council Board of Tenured or Tenure-Track Faculty, which votes on matters specific to tenure or tenured/tenure track (T/TT) faculty. 8. Term of Office: The regular term of office for a member shall be three years beginning on the first day of the fall semester. No member shall serve more than two terms in succession, but a member may serve any number of discontinued terms, and even though he/shethe member has served two terms in succession may from time to time serve two more terms in succession after a break in service. Terms of less than three years, whether of one or two years duration or fraction thereof shall count the same as a three- year term. I. Officers of the Faculty 1. The chairperson of the general faculty shall be the chancellor. The vice chairperson of the faculty shall be the chairperson of the Faculty Council. Ordinarily, the chairperson shall preside at faculty meetings, but determination of who shall preside will be guided by the nature of the business at hand.

The Faculty Council shall vote on such petition, and if approved, shall initiate a campus- wide election. K. Faculty Tenure Committee 1. The University of Missouri-Columbia Faculty Committee on Tenure shall be composed of members elected by the faculty of colleges OPEN - CONSENT - I-13 April 22, 2021and schools that are headed by deans who report to the provost for academic affairs. The faculty of each such college or school shall be entitled to have one single elected member of the University of Missouri-Columbia Faculty Committee on Tenure at any given time. 2. Faculty of each college or school shall, at a regular meeting during the second semester in each academic year, elect one of its members to membership on the University of Missouri-Columbia Faculty Committee on Tenure to serve for the following academic year, and also elect an alternative member, who shall serve in the event the regular committee member is unable to serve. If a faculty fails to elect during the second semester, or a vacancy in its representation occurs after it has elected, a later election may be conducted. Elections of members and alternate members shall be reported to the provost of academic affairs who shall cause the names of the members, alternate members and officers of the committee to be published in the same manner as the membership of the Faculty Council on University Policy. 3. At the inception of a hearing before the committee, the respondent and the relator may challenge members present (including alternate members and the chairperson and secretary) for cause. A member challenged for cause is entitled to be present during the hearing on the challenge but he/she, the relator and respondent, shall withdraw from the meeting during the vote on the challenge. If a challenge for cause of the chairperson is sustained, the secretary shall act as chairperson. If neither the chairperson nor the secretary is present after action on challenges for cause, the committee shall elect a chairperson pro tempore to preside at the hearing. 4.

L. Procedures Governing the Disposition of Charges of Faculty Irresponsibility 1. Basis for the Article -- This faculty has affirmed its commitment to the principles of academic freedom repeatedly, and has recognized that academic freedom implies also academic and professional responsibility and obligations. In support of this recognition the faculty has accepted the American Association of University Professors' statement of ethical standards (1966) and other standards pertaining to specific duties. (Ref: Section OPEN - CONSENT - I-14 April 22, 2021300.010.C of these Bylaws; Section 420.010 Research Dishonesty) Following the principle that a faculty should monitor its own members, Section 300.010.L establishes appropriate procedures for dealing with cases of alleged violation of professional responsibility. 2.

The provost shall discuss the substances of the charge with the accuser(s) to assure further that the facts and nature of the charge are understood clearly. Once the provost has verified the procedural adequacy of the charge, he/she shall forward it promptly to the dean of the division in which the accused faculty member or teacher has his/her academic appointment. c. Upon receipt of the signed, written charge against a faculty member or teacher employed within his/her division, the dean shall consult with the accused's OPEN - CONSENT - I-15 April 22, 2021department chairperson, in those divisions with more than one department.

A copy of this report shall be supplied to the accused. In addition, the chairperson shall provide the accused with a written statement of his/her recommendations for disposition of the charge and shall describe the rights of the accused to an informal hearing. b. If the divisional dean agrees with the acceptable solution and the provost for academic affairs concurs, this shall end the matter and the accused shall be so informed. If the divisional dean or the provost for academic affairs does not agree with the acceptable solution or if no acceptable solution was reached, the matter may be referred back to the department chairperson for further negotiation, or the procedures under Section 300.010.L.6 shall be followed. c. In those divisions having only one department, the divisional dean shall take the steps set out in Section 300.010.L.5 and shall report to the provost for academic affairs. d.

After a written request for an informal hearing, such hearing shall be held by a committee designated for this function according to the following procedure: (1) A Department Committee on Faculty Responsibility shall be established annually according to normal procedures in the structuring of committees in the department. If the accused or the accuser is a member of the committee, he/she is disqualified from the committee for that case. If the accused is a teacher, the department committee must be adjusted to include peers of the same academic rank, in proportion to the department roster. In small departments, same-level peers may be appointed from related departments by mutual consent of the accused and the department chairperson. The chairperson shall supply the accused with a written report of the membership of the Department Committee on Faculty Responsibility. (2) For the Divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility, a panel of 13 faculty members and a special panel of five teachers shall be named annually by the Divisional Policy Committee. In any case where the accused or the accuser is a member of the panel, he/she shall be replaced by a substitute appointed by the Divisional Policy Committee.

After completion of the hearing the committee shall meet in closed session and after deliberation prepare a written report. This report (including a minority report, if any) shall be transmitted to the divisional dean and a copy transmitted promptly to the accused. This report shall be limited to one of the following: (1) The charge is unfounded or there is insufficient reason to believe the accused has violated professional ethics or acted irresponsibly, and the matter should be dropped without prejudice to the accused. The justification for this conclusion must be included. (2) There is sufficient reason to believe the accused has acted unethically or irresponsibly, and (a) If the accused is a faculty member, the matter should be referred for a formal hearing.

If the hearing is waived and no informal hearing under Section 300.010.L.6 has been held, the matter shall be returned to the divisional dean who may then recommend termination of appointment as under Section 300.010.L.7.b, or any other action he/she OPEN - CONSENT - I-19 April 22, 2021considers appropriate. If he/she does not recommend termination of appointment, or if the informal hearing has been held, the procedures of Section 300.010.L.9 shall be followed. b. For the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, the Faculty Council shall name annually a panel of thirteen (13) faculty members. If the accuser of any person who has engaged in the investigation of the case is a member of the panel, he/she shall be disqualified and a replacement shall be appointed by the Faculty Council. When a case is referred to the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, the provost for academic affairs will strike three (3) names from the panel; then the accused will strike three (3) names from the panel; the remaining seven (7) members will constitute the committee. The formal hearing shall be conducted according to the following procedures: (1) The provost for academic affairs shall convene the committee. The committee shall elect a chairperson who shall preside. The provost for academic affairs shall present the case. Generally accepted principles and procedures of administrative due process shall govern the conduct of the hearing. The hearing shall not necessarily be limited by the rules of evidence applied in civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Both the committee and the provost for academic affairs may receive the advice of counsel. (2) The committee and the accused shall receive from the provost for academic affairs prior to the hearing copies of all reports and recommendations in the case, the text of the original charge, the name(s) of the accuser(s) and the names of the witnesses. (3) The accused shall have the right to be present at the hearing, to have counsel of his/her choice present with him/her at the hearing, to address the committee at any reasonable time upon request, to offer and present evidence, to examine all documents offered at the hearing and challenge their validity or admissibility, to question all witnesses, and to have his/her counsel perform any and all of these acts in his/her behalf. After the termination of the proceedings and completion of the committee's report, the accused shall receive promptly a transcript of the proceedings at University expense. c. Following the hearing, the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility shall meet in closed session and, after deliberation, shall prepare a written report which shall include findings of fact (including whether the accused committed the acts mentioned in the charge), a determination of whether the accused's acts constitute a significant violation of professional ethics or responsibility, and the recommendation of OPEN - CONSENT - I-20 April 22, 2021specific sanctions or actions to be taken in the case. If the committee's recommendations differ from those made by the divisional dean, the report shall include the reasons for the difference. The report (including a minority report, if any) shall be transmitted promptly to the accused. (1) If the committee recommends termination of appointment and the provost for academic affairs concurs; or if the provost for academic affairs recommends termination of appointment, the matter shall be governed by the Academic Tenure Regulations and no further proceedings under this Article shall be taken. (2) If termination of appointment is not recommended, the report shall be transmitted to the chancellor and the procedures of Section 300.010.L.9 shall be followed. 9. Review by the Chancellor -- The chancellor shall, on written request of the accused or of the provost for academic affairs filed within seven days from the notification of the decision of the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, or may, on his/her motion without the filing of an appeal, review the case and affirm, modify, or reverse the decision or remand it to the committee for rehearing. If the chancellor accepts an appeal or otherwise formally reviews the case, he/she shall notify the provost for academic affairs and the accused, and shall afford them an opportunity to make written submissions or suggestions concerning the disposition of the appeal on review. If the chancellor reverses or modifies the decision of the committee, he/she shall set forth in writing a statement of his/her decision and the reasons therefor, and shall furnish a copy of his/her statement to the accused and to have accepted the committee's decision as the final disposition of the case. If the chancellor is absent from the campus or for any reason is unable to act throughout the review period, he/she may designate a deputy (not the provost for academic affairs) to discharge this function for him/her, or in case of need the president may be requested by the provost for academic affairs or the chairperson of the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility to name a deputy to exercise the chancellor's authority in the case. After action by the chancellor, any further appeal by the accused shall be confined to the general right of all members of the University to petition the president and the Board of Curators. 10. Charges Against Administrators -- This Article shall cover charges of unethical or irresponsible actions against administrators in their teaching capacities. If a charge is filed against a divisional dean in his teaching capacity, the case shall be referred to the provost for academic affairs and the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility without action or recommendation at the departmental or divisional level. If a charge is filed against the provost for academic affairs in his/her teaching capacity, the charge shall be in the hands of the chancellor and the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility. Charges of unethical or irresponsible actions against administrators in their capacity as administrators OPEN - CONSENT - I-21 April 22, 2021involve procedures beyond the scope of this Article. However, in such cases, the chancellor may seek the assistance and advice of the department, divisional or Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility. 11. General Provisions -- Successful operation of these procedures depends upon the integrity, good faith and cooperation of all persons involved. Circumvention of these procedures by the imposition of penal sanctions under the guise of purely administrative actions must be avoided. Both faculty and administrators in carrying out their duties should keep in mind the goal of dealing with cases promptly and fairly with due regard for the interests of the accused and the University. The following guidelines and principles will be expected to characterize the monitoring of Faculty responsibility through all formal and informal proceedings: a. Preservation of academic freedom, tenure rights, and the integrity of the University community. b. Protection of faculty members and teachers against malicious and multiple charges, intimidation and harassment. c. Protection of the accuser against recriminations when a charge is made in good faith. d. Confidentiality of all aspects of responsibility hearings. e. Caution in the dissemination of information concerning disposition of a case. f. Promptness in conducting each step of the investigation, consistent with fairness in time allowed for preparation. Seven to fourteen days in which the University is in session are reasonable lower and upper limits for each action, with extensions possible for good cause. g. Assurance to all parties involved of adequate notification of meetings and scheduling at times and places convenient to the persons involved. h. Freedom of the accused against sanctions prior to completion of these procedures. In a serious case where the continuation of duties by an accused would disrupt the educational process or would create a serious threat to lives and property, the chancellor may suspend the accused without loss of pay, on good cause shown and incorporated into written findings delivered to the accused. i. The rights of the accused to waive any or all of the peer judgment steps in these procedures and to negotiate a settlement with appropriate administrative officers at any time. j. The right and desirability of the divisional dean, after receiving a committee report (or in the absence of such a report where a hearing has been waived), to request and receive from the department chairperson communications concerning the disposition of the OPEN - CONSENT - I-22 April 22, 2021case prior to the divisional dean's taking action; and the similar right of the provost for academic affairs to communicate with the divisional dean and the department chairperson. M. Revision of Bylaws -- Revisions of these Bylaws may be proposed by Faculty Council. Proposed revisions shall be presented and discussed at a meeting of the general faculty or a faculty forum. As soon as possible after the general faculty meeting or faculty forum, all faculty members will be notified of the proposed revision and provided access to a ballot. Ballots will be tabulated by a committee of Faculty Council within two weeks following completion of voting. A simple majority of the votes submitted will be required for approval. Results of the vote will be reported to Faculty Council and then all faculty members as soon as feasible. Revisions become effective upon approval by the Board of Curators.

Professional Ethics and Academic Responsibilities -- The professor, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognizes the special responsibilities placed upon him/her. His/her primary responsibility to his/her subject is to seek and to state the truth as he/she sees it. To this end he/she devotes his/her energies to developing and improving his/her scholarly competence. He/she accepts the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge. He/she practices intellectual honesty. Although he/she may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise his/her freedom of inquiry. a. As a teacher, the professor encourages the free pursuit of learning in his/her students. He/she holds before them the best scholarly standards of his/her discipline. He/she demonstrates respect for the student as an individual, and adheres to his/her proper role as intellectual guide and counselor. He/she makes every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that his/her evaluation of students reflects their true merit. He/she respects the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. He/she avoids any exploitation of students for his/her private advantage and acknowledges significant assistance from them. He/she protects their academic freedom. b. As a colleague, the professor has obligations that derive from common membership in the community for scholars. He/she respects and defends the free inquiry of his/her associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas he/she shows due respect for the opinions of others. He/she acknowledges his/her academic debts and strives to be objective in his/her professional judgment of colleagues. He/she accepts his/her share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of his/her institution. c. As a member of his/her institution, the professor seeks above all to be an effective teacher and scholar. Although he/she observes the stated regulations of the institution, provided they do not contravene academic freedom, he/she maintains his/her right to criticize and seek revision. He/she determines the amount and character of the work he/she does outside his/her institution with due regard to his/her paramount responsibilities within it. When considering the interruption or termination of his/her service he/she recognizes the effect of his/her decision upon the program of the institution and gives due notice of his/her intentions. d. As a member of his/her community, the professor has the rights and the obligations of any citizen. He/she measures the urgency of those obligations in the light of his/her responsibilities to his/her subject, OPEN - CONSENT - I-25 April 22, 2021to his/her students, to his/her profession, and to his/her institution. When he/she speaks or acts as a private person he/she avoids creating the impression that he/she speaks or acts for his/her college or university. As a citizen engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, the professor has a particular obligation for promoting conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. Further, the faculty accepts the responsibility of monitoring its own members if accepted standards of professional responsibility are abrogated (Section 300.010.L of these Bylaws). 3. Authority -- The faculty's authority, as delegated by the Board of Curators, is of three types: direct and primary, in which the faculty has essential decision-making authority; shared, in which the faculty participates with others; and advisory, in which the faculty counsels with the person or offices with ultimate decision-making authority. (On those matters requiring multi-campus coordination, the faculty shall act through its appropriate bodies, Section 300.010.F.) a. Primary and Direct Authority -- The UMC faculty has essential decision-making authority in matters directly affecting the educational program of UMC, including but not limited to: (1) Articulation and maintenance of standards of academic performance -- this includes but is not limited to guidelines for appropriate research, service, and scholarships; requirements for graduation; and related matters.

E. Faculty Organization OPEN - CONSENT - I-28 April 22, 20211. The authority of the faculty as delegated by the Board of Curators shall include the responsibilities set forth in Section 300.010.C. In order to perform these functions, the faculty takes cognizance of the consequences of its size and complexity and therefore delegates specific policy making and coordinating functions to representative bodies. The main representative body shall be a Faculty Council. 2. The Faculty Council is established as the elected representative body of the faculty. It shall act for the general faculty on all matters within the framework of the policies expressed in these Bylaws and shall function in accordance with the specifications formulated in Section 300.010.C. The Faculty Council shall have the right to delegate some of its operation tasks to an executive committee and/or its officers. 3. The Faculty as a whole shall approve all policies which involve a modification or change of the principles set forth in these Bylaws. The faculty further may review decisions and actions by the Faculty Council provided that a petition requesting such action has been signed by at least 25 faculty members representing at least three divisions of the campus. 4. There shall be a Graduate Faculty organization. It shall develop its own criteria for membership, organizational structure, its own obligations and rights providing they are consonant with the philosophy and principles of the federal faculty Bylaws. The Graduate Faculty shall determine the functions of the Graduate Faculty Senate. The Graduate Faculty shall set standards for graduate education on the campus, provided they meet at least the minimum standards established by the general faculty. 5. Divisional faculties are established in the various academic divisions. They shall develop policies adapted to their specific needs, but standards of performance must not be set below those established by the general faculty. 6. Establishment of new divisions shall entitle them to representation where divisional representation is designated in these Bylaws or otherwise deemed appropriate. F. Faculty Participatory Authority and Functions in Campus Governance 1. Participatory authority and functions of the faculty are expressed through faculty involvement in the campus committee structure including those committees which govern academic and administrative matters affecting the campus, faculty and students. The faculty participates in the selection of administrative officers. The faculty participates in the monitoring of administrative and academic operating procedures. These participatory functions of the faculty are articulated as follows: a. The faculty, through its elected representative structure, the Faculty Council, nominate faculty members to participate in a specially designated body currently called the University Assembly which is charged with advising the chancellor on matters mutually affecting all constituencies of the University (faculty, students, administration, and non-academic OPEN - CONSENT - I-29 April 22, 2021employees), and nominating members to campus- wide standing committees. The participation of the UMC faculty in this Assembly will represent faculty participation to the extent that the domains of faculty primary and direct authority are not infringed upon. b. An Academic Regulations Committee shall be established consisting of representatives of the Faculty Council (which may be the Executive Committee) and campus administration. This committee will assume responsibility for the development and monitoring of campus standard operating guidelines which, after approval by the Faculty Council, administration, and students where appropriate, shall be published as \"Academic Regulations Manual.\" These guidelines will cover the academic schedule of studies and examinations, calendar, academic procedures and policies and campus governance and shall be consonant with these Bylaws. This committee will meet regularly to monitor these guidelines and to coordinate the need for modification and changes. c. The Faculty Council will nominate faculty members to participate in ad hoc committees, including Search and Screening Committees for campus administrators and academic officers. 2. The faculty representatives to the University Assembly and the Academic Regulations Committee will report to the Faculty Council at appropriate intervals. G. Faculty Participation in University-wide Governance 1. The faculty shall participate in education policy determination about those matters which are University-wide; some of these will be parallel to those issues in which the faculty exercises shared authority at the campus level (Section 300.010.C.3.a). The faculty's responsibility in these matters shall be exercised through mechanisms such as: a. The Intercampus Faculty Council on which the UMC faculty shall have representatives designated by the UMC Faculty Council. b. The University Doctoral Council to which the UMC Graduate Faculty shall elect its members. c. Ad hoc and standing University-wide committees to which the faculty (often acting through its elected campus body, the Faculty Council) shall designate its members. d. Intercampus committees concerned with cooperation in educational and research activities within the respective disciplines. H. Faculty Council on UMC Policy OPEN - CONSENT - I-30 April 22, 20211.

The Faculty Council shall have certain delegated authority to act on behalf of the General Faculty (Section 310.010.C.3.c of these Bylaws). In addition, the Council, as a representative faculty voice, shall advise the chancellor and the UMC faculty on questions of UMC policy submitted by either to the Council, and may initiate recommendations concerning changes in the UMC policy for consideration and appropriate action by the chancellor or UMC faculty. 2. Academic Unit Selections: All colleges and schools that are headed by a dean who reports to the provost for academic affairs shall be entitled to voting representation. For the purposes of Academic Unit Selections MU Libraries will be collectively treated as a school entitled to voting representation. 3. Allocation of Representatives: Faculty Representatives shall be allocated to a college or school on the basis of the total number of full-time ranked faculty members of the UMC faculty within the college or school. The determination of the number of full-time ranked faculty representatives shall be made on November 1 of each academic year, and the number so determined shall govern representation for the next academic year. A full-time ranked representative who has a joint appointment in two or more colleges or schools shall be assigned to the college or school in which the representative devotes the largest percentage of the representative's time. If the assignment cannot be made on this basis, the Council shall make the assignment, first having consulted with the representative to the extent feasible. Representation of the various colleges and schools shall be based upon persons holding eligible ranks listed in the most recent UMC general catalog. Emeritus professors will not be included in the computations, with the exception that retired professors on continued service will be counted. Each college or school shall be entitled to representation at a basic ratio of one representative for each fifty (50) full-time ranked faculty members or majority fraction thereof (26-49), and in particular as follows: one (1) representative for 1-75; two (2) representatives for 76-125; and so on for each additional fifty (50) full-time ranked faculty or major fraction thereof. Notwithstanding the basic ratio, no school or college is entitled to more than eight representatives. In the event the number of full-time ranked faculty members changes to the point where the basic ratio would give less than 30 or more than 35 representatives, the Council by a finding recorded in its minutes shall adjust the ratio to produce not less than 30 and not more than 35 representatives. OPEN - CONSENT - I-31 April 22, 20214. Minimum Number of T/TT and NTT Representatives: The minimum number of T/TT faculty representatives on the Council shall be four, and the minimum number of NTT faculty representatives on Council shall be four. If, as the result of academic unit selections of representatives, fewer than four NTT faculty or four T/TT faculty are included in the makeup of Faculty Council on September 15 of any year, Faculty Council shall organize and hold a special election of the respective full-time ranked NTT or T/TT faculty to achieve the minimum. Only full-time ranked NTT faculty will vote in a special election for an NTT representative; Only full-time ranked T/TT faculty will vote in a special election for a T/TT representative. The selected representatives will be added to the Faculty Council in addition to those chosen by the academic unit selections, and their addition may increase the size of Faculty Council to more than 35 full-time faculty ranked faculty representatives. Representatives elected in special elections will serve regular three-year terms. 5. Limitation on Administrative Members: Members of the UMC faculty who hold administrative positions with the rank of assistant dean or higher, or equivalent positions regardless of the title, are ineligible for election or service. Only those eligible to serve on the Faculty Council as full-time ranked faculty are eligible to vote for full-time ranked representatives on the Council. 6. Election Procedures : The full-time ranked faculty of each college or school shall determine the election procedures for the election of its representative or representatives and shall report these to the Faculty Council. Election shall be by secret ballot. In those divisions that have two or more representatives, terms shall be staggered. 7. T/TT Matters: As defined in the Faculty Council Rules of Order, NTT faculty representatives are not eligible for service on the Faculty Council Board of Tenured or Tenure-Track Faculty, which votes on matters specific to tenure or tenured/tenure track (T/TT) faculty. 8. Term of Office: The regular term of office for a member shall be three years beginning on the first day of the fall semester. No member shall serve more than two terms in succession, but a member may serve any number of discontinued terms, and even though the member has served two terms in succession may from time to time serve two more terms in succession after a break in service. Terms of less than three years, whether of one or two years duration or fraction thereof shall count the same as a three- year term. I. Officers of the Faculty 1. The chairperson of the general faculty shall be the chancellor. The vice chairperson of the faculty shall be the chairperson of the Faculty Council. Ordinarily, the chairperson shall preside at faculty meetings, but determination of who shall preside will be guided by the nature of the business at hand.

A parliamentarian shall be appointed by the chairperson from among members of the faculty. J. Designation of Faculty Representatives 1. The Faculty Council shall monitor faculty representation on all committees where such representation is required by the Bylaws and on other committees where faculty representation is appropriate. 2. Faculty-originated appointments to campus and university committees may be challenged by a signed petition calling for a campus-wide election from at least 25 members of the faculty representing at least three divisions of UMC. The Faculty Council shall vote on such petition, and if approved, shall initiate a campus- wide election. K. Faculty Tenure Committee 1. The University of Missouri-Columbia Faculty Committee on Tenure shall be composed of members elected by the faculty of colleges and schools that are headed by deans who report to the provost for academic affairs. The faculty of each such college or school shall be entitled to have one single elected member of the University of Missouri-Columbia Faculty Committee on Tenure at any given time. 2. Faculty of each college or school shall, at a regular meeting during the second semester in each academic year, elect one of its members to membership on the University of Missouri-Columbia Faculty Committee on Tenure to serve for the following academic year, and also elect an alternative member, who shall serve in the event the regular committee member is unable to serve. If a faculty fails to elect during the second semester, or a vacancy in its representation occurs after it has elected, a later election may be conducted. Elections of members and alternate members shall be reported to the provost of academic affairs who shall cause the names of the members, alternate members and officers of the committee to be published in the same manner as the membership of the Faculty Council on University Policy. 3. At the inception of a hearing before the committee, the respondent and the relator may challenge members present (including alternate members and the chairperson and secretary) for cause. A member challenged for cause is entitled to be present during the OPEN - CONSENT - I-33 April 22, 2021hearing on the challenge but he/she, the relator and respondent, shall withdraw from the meeting during the vote on the challenge. If a challenge for cause of the chairperson is sustained, the secretary shall act as chairperson. If neither the chairperson nor the secretary is present after action on challenges for cause, the committee shall elect a chairperson pro tempore to preside at the hearing. 4. As prescribed by Sections 310.010-310.070, University of Missouri Collected Rules and Regulations, at least ten members of the committee or their alternates must be present to constitute a quorum at a meeting to elect a permanent chairperson or secretary and at the inception of a hearing. For the purposes of acting on challenges and conducting a hearing after the disposition of challenges, seven members of the committee, or their alternates, shall constitute a quorum. If, during the course of a hearing, the number of members, or their alternates, not previously removed by challenge, are present. The relator and the respondent shall be given opportunities to challenge for cause members or their alternates who were not present from the inception of the hearing and to request that such members or alternates listen to or read the taped or stenographic record of any portion of the hearing at which they were not present. L. Procedures Governing the Disposition of Charges of Faculty Irresponsibility 1. Basis for the Article -- This faculty has affirmed its commitment to the principles of academic freedom repeatedly, and has recognized that academic freedom implies also academic and professional responsibility and obligations. In support of this recognition the faculty has accepted the American Association of University Professors' statement of ethical standards (1966) and other standards pertaining to specific duties. (Ref: Section 300.010.C of these Bylaws; Section 420.010 Research Dishonesty) Following the principle that a faculty should monitor its own members, Section 300.010.L establishes appropriate procedures for dealing with cases of alleged violation of professional responsibility. 2. Definition of Faculty Member and Teacher a. The term \"faculty member\" as used in this article means a person holding a regular or non-regular academic staff position at the rank of instructor or above. b. The term \"teacher\" as used in this article means a person other than a \"faculty member\" who holds an academic staff position. 3. Purpose and Limits of the Article -- This article shall govern the filing and disposition of charges alleging breaches of professional ethics or commission of irresponsible acts made against UMC faculty members and teachers. No portion of this article shall be deemed to amend or affect Section 10 of the Academic Tenure Regulations, March 10, 1950, or any revision thereof; nor shall this article be construed to affect adversely the rights which any person may have under the University Tenure Regulations. OPEN - CONSENT - I-34 April 22, 20214. Initiation and Transmission of a Charge -- A charge of unethical or irresponsible action may be brought against a faculty member or teacher by a person or group of persons associated with the University, such as a student, faculty member, teacher, administrator, or board member. a. The charge must be submitted in writing and signed by the person or persons making the charge. The charge must specify the act or acts which allegedly constitute unethical or irresponsible action, and must be supported by pertinent details such as time(s), the act(s) was/were committed, specific place(s) where the act(s) occurred, names of witnesses who are able to support the charge, the conditions under which the alleged act(s) occurred, and any additional relevant information. b. The charge shall be transmitted promptly to the UMC provost for academic affairs, whose office shall ascertain the extent to which the charge describes the act(s) that allegedly constitutes unethical or irresponsible action, and determine that all necessary details have been supplied. The provost shall discuss the substances of the charge with the accuser(s) to assure further that the facts and nature of the charge are understood clearly. Once the provost has verified the procedural adequacy of the charge, he/she shall forward it promptly to the dean of the division in which the accused faculty member or teacher has his/her academic appointment. c. Upon receipt of the signed, written charge against a faculty member or teacher employed within his/her division, the dean shall consult with the accused's department chairperson, in those divisions with more than one department. They shall review the charge for adequacy of procedural detail. If in their opinions, the charge is vague or insufficiently detailed, they shall so inform the provost in writing and return the charge to him/her with a request for clarification, or addition of information, and resubmission. d. If in the opinions of the divisional dean and the department chairperson the charge is properly described, the department chairperson, or dean in those divisions without departments, as soon as possible, shall provide the accused with a full copy of the charge, including the name of the person, or persons, making the charge. 5. Action by the Department Chairperson (or Divisional Dean) - - The department chairperson shall discuss the alleged violation informally with the accused and with the accuser, meeting them either together or separately, or both, and shall attempt to reconcile differences and find a solution acceptable to all persons involved. OPEN - CONSENT - I-35 April 22, 2021a. If an acceptable solution is found, this shall be reported by the chairperson in writing to the divisional dean along with any explanation and justification. A copy of the report shall be furnished the accused. If an acceptable solution is not found, the department chairperson shall report this fact in writing to the divisional dean along with such comments as he/she considers appropriate. A copy of this report shall be supplied to the accused. In addition, the chairperson shall provide the accused with a written statement of his/her recommendations for disposition of the charge and shall describe the rights of the accused to an informal hearing. b. If the divisional dean agrees with the acceptable solution and the provost for academic affairs concurs, this shall end the matter and the accused shall be so informed. If the divisional dean or the provost for academic affairs does not agree with the acceptable solution or if no acceptable solution was reached, the matter may be referred back to the department chairperson for further negotiation, or the procedures under Section 300.010.L.6 shall be followed. c. In those divisions having only one department, the divisional dean shall take the steps set out in Section 300.010.L.5 and shall report to the provost for academic affairs. d. The department chairperson or the divisional dean shall be disqualified from action under Section 300.010.L.5 if he/she is the accuser or the accused and in such case the respective department or division shall elect a chairperson pro tem to act instead. 6. Informal Hearing Before Peers at the Department or Divisional Level -- If a resolution of the charge is not reached under the provisions of Section 300.010.L.5, the divisional dean shall inform the accused in writing of his/her recommendations for disposition of the charge, and shall describe the rights of the accused to an informal hearing. The accused may request in writing an informal hearing at either the department level (in divisions with more than one department) or the divisional level, but not both. If no written request is made by the accused within ten (10) school days, or if he/she waives in writing the informal hearing, the procedures of Section 300.010.L.7 shall be followed. a. After a written request for an informal hearing, such hearing shall be held by a committee designated for this function according to the following procedure: (1) A Department Committee on Faculty Responsibility shall be established annually according to normal procedures in the structuring of committees in the department. If the accused or the accuser is a member of the committee, he/she is disqualified from the committee for that case. If the accused is a OPEN - CONSENT - I-36 April 22, 2021teacher, the department committee must be adjusted to include peers of the same academic rank, in proportion to the department roster. In small departments, same-level peers may be appointed from related departments by mutual consent of the accused and the department chairperson. The chairperson shall supply the accused with a written report of the membership of the Department Committee on Faculty Responsibility. (2) For the Divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility, a panel of 13 faculty members and a special panel of five teachers shall be named annually by the Divisional Policy Committee. In any case where the accused or the accuser is a member of the panel, he/she shall be replaced by a substitute appointed by the Divisional Policy Committee. (a) When the accused is a faculty member, the divisional dean will strike three names and then the accused will strike three names from the panel of faculty members and the remaining seven faculty members will constitute the committee. (b) When the accused is a teacher, five members of the panel of Faculty members will be removed by lot from the panel and replaced by the members of the special panel of teachers. From the resulting panel of 13 the divisional dean will strike three names and then the accused will strike three names and the remaining seven members will constitute the committee. (c) The Divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility, once constituted, shall organize itself. The divisional dean shall supply the accused with the names of the members of the Divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility. b. The committee (department or division) shall investigate the charge and shall offer the accused and the accuser an opportunity to state their positions and to present testimony and other evidence relevant to the case. The accused shall have access to all information considered by the committee and the names of all persons giving evidence against him/her. The hearing shall be informal and the accused and the accuser at their option may be present during the hearing. Other persons shall not be present except while giving testimony or other evidence. c. After completion of the hearing the committee shall meet in closed session and after deliberation prepare a written report. This report (including a minority report, if any) shall be transmitted to the divisional dean and a copy transmitted promptly to the accused. OPEN - CONSENT - I-37 April 22, 2021This report shall be limited to one of the following: (1) The charge is unfounded or there is insufficient reason to believe the accused has violated professional ethics or acted irresponsibly, and the matter should be dropped without prejudice to the accused. The justification for this conclusion must be included. (2) There is sufficient reason to believe the accused has acted unethically or irresponsibly, and (a) If the accused is a faculty member, the matter should be referred for a formal hearing. No recommendation as to sanction should be made but an assessment of the seriousness of the alleged violation, including whether it is serious enough that termination of appointment should be considered, shall be made. (b) If the accused is a teacher, a recommendation as to the appropriate sanction shall be made. The justification for this conclusion must be included. 7. Action by the Divisional Dean and the Provost for Academic Affairs a. If the accused is a faculty member and no request for an informal hearing was made, the divisional dean with the concurrence of the provost for academic affairs shall either: (1) Dismiss the charge, in which case the matter is closed without prejudice to the accused, or (2) Refer the matter to the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility without any recommendation as to sanction, in which case the procedures of Section 300.010.L.8 shall be followed. If the provost for academic affairs does not concur,he/she may take either of the above actions on his/her own motion. b. If the accused is a faculty member, after receiving the recommendation of the department or divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility, the divisional dean with the concurrence of the pProvost for academic affairs shall either: (1) Dismiss the charge, in which case the matter is closed without prejudice to the accused, or (2) Refer the matter to the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility with or without a recommendation as to sanction, in which case the procedures of Section 300.010.L.8 shall be followed, or (3) Recommend that the accused's appointment be terminated, in which case the matter shall be governed by the Academic Tenure Regulations and no further proceedings under this Article shall be taken. OPEN - CONSENT - I-38 April 22, 2021If the provost for academic affairs does not concur, he/she may take any of the above actions on his/her own motion. If the action of the divisional dean or the provost for academic affairs differs from the conclusion reached by the department or divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility, a statement of reasons shall be given. Notification of the action with the statement of reasons shall be transmitted promptly to the accused. c. If the accused is a teacher, after receiving the report of the department or divisional Committee on Faculty Responsibility, or if the informal hearing was not requested, the divisional dean shall dispose of the case. Notification of his/her disposition with a statement of reasons shall be transmitted promptly to the accused. The divisional dean's decision is subject to review by the provost for academic affairs who may accept an appeal from the teacher or review the case on his/her own motion. 8. Formal Hearing before Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility a. If the matter is referred for a formal hearing before the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, the accused may, within seven school days after notification of the referral, waive in writing the hearing before the Campus Committee. If the hearing is waived and no informal hearing under Section 300.010.L.6 has been held, the matter shall be returned to the divisional dean who may then recommend termination of appointment as under Section 300.010.L.7.b, or any other action he/she considers appropriate. If he/she does not recommend termination of appointment, or if the informal hearing has been held, the procedures of Section 300.010.L.9 shall be followed. b. For the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, the Faculty Council shall name annually a panel of thirteen (13) faculty members. If the accuser of any person who has engaged in the investigation of the case is a member of the panel, he/she shall be disqualified and a replacement shall be appointed by the Faculty Council. When a case is referred to the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, the provost for academic affairs will strike three (3) names from the panel; then the accused will strike three (3) names from the panel; the remaining seven (7) members will constitute the committee. The formal hearing shall be conducted according to the following procedures: (1) The provost for academic affairs shall convene the OPEN - CONSENT - I-39 April 22, 2021committee. The committee shall elect a chairperson who shall preside. The provost for academic affairs shall present the case. Generally accepted principles and procedures of administrative due process shall govern the conduct of the hearing. The hearing shall not necessarily be limited by the rules of evidence applied in civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Both the committee and the provost for academic affairs may receive the advice of counsel. (2) The committee and the accused shall receive from the provost for academic affairs prior to the hearing copies of all reports and recommendations in the case, the text of the original charge, the name(s) of the accuser(s) and the names of the witnesses. (3) The accused shall have the right to be present at the hearing, to have counsel of his/her choice present with him/her at the hearing, to address the committee at any reasonable time upon request, to offer and present evidence, to examine all documents offered at the hearing and challenge their validity or admissibility, to question all witnesses, and to have his/her counsel perform any and all of these acts in his/her behalf. After the termination of the proceedings and completion of the committee's report, the accused shall receive promptly a transcript of the proceedings at University expense. c. Following the hearing, the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility shall meet in closed session and, after deliberation, shall prepare a written report which shall include findings of fact (including whether the accused committed the acts mentioned in the charge), a determination of whether the accused's acts constitute a significant violation of professional ethics or responsibility, and the recommendation of specific sanctions or actions to be taken in the case. If the committee's recommendations differ from those made by the divisional dean, the report shall include the reasons for the difference. The report (including a minority report, if any) shall be transmitted promptly to the accused. (1) If the committee recommends termination of appointment and the provost for academic affairs concurs; or if the provost for academic affairs recommends termination of appointment, the matter shall be governed by the Academic Tenure Regulations and no further proceedings under this Article shall be taken. (2) If termination of appointment is not recommended, the report shall be transmitted to the chancellor and the procedures of Section 300.010.L.9 shall be followed. 9. Review by the Chancellor -- The chancellor shall, on written request of the accused or of the provost for academic affairs filed OPEN - CONSENT - I-40 April 22, 2021within seven days from the notification of the decision of the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility, or may, on his/her motion without the filing of an appeal, review the case and affirm, modify, or reverse the decision or remand it to the committee for rehearing. If the chancellor accepts an appeal or otherwise formally reviews the case, he/she shall notify the provost for academic affairs and the accused, and shall afford them an opportunity to make written submissions or suggestions concerning the disposition of the appeal on review. If the chancellor reverses or modifies the decision of the committee, he/she shall set forth in writing a statement of his/her decision and the reasons therefor, and shall furnish a copy of his/her statement to the accused and to have accepted the committee's decision as the final disposition of the case. If the chancellor is absent from the campus or for any reason is unable to act throughout the review period, he/she may designate a deputy (not the provost for academic affairs) to discharge this function for him/her, or in case of need the president may be requested by the provost for academic affairs or the chairperson of the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility to name a deputy to exercise the chancellor's authority in the case. After action by the chancellor, any further appeal by the accused shall be confined to the general right of all members of the University to petition the president and the Board of Curators. 10. Charges Against Administrators -- This Article shall cover charges of unethical or irresponsible actions against administrators in their teaching capacities. If a charge is filed against a divisional dean in his teaching capacity, the case shall be referred to the provost for academic affairs and the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility without action or recommendation at the departmental or divisional level. If a charge is filed against the provost for academic affairs in his/her teaching capacity, the charge shall be in the hands of the chancellor and the Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility. Charges of unethical or irresponsible actions against administrators in their capacity as administrators involve procedures beyond the scope of this Article. However, in such cases, the chancellor may seek the assistance and advice of the department, divisional or Campus Committee on Faculty Responsibility. 11. General Provisions -- Successful operation of these procedures depends upon the integrity, good faith and cooperation of all persons involved. Circumvention of these procedures by the imposition of penal sanctions under the guise of purely administrative actions must be avoided. Both faculty and administrators in carrying out their duties should keep in mind the goal of dealing with cases promptly and fairly with due regard for the interests of the accused and the University. The following guidelines and principles will be expected to characterize the monitoring of Faculty responsibility through all formal and informal proceedings: a. Preservation of academic freedom, tenure rights, and the integrity of the University community. OPEN - CONSENT - I-41 April 22, 2021b. Protection of faculty members and teachers against malicious and multiple charges, intimidation and harassment. c. Protection of the accuser against recriminations when a charge is made in good faith. d. Confidentiality of all aspects of responsibility hearings. e. Caution in the dissemination of information concerning disposition of a case. f. Promptness in conducting each step of the investigation, consistent with fairness in time allowed for preparation. Seven to fourteen days in which the University is in session are reasonable lower and upper limits for each action, with extensions possible for good cause. g. Assurance to all parties involved of adequate notification of meetings and scheduling at times and places convenient to the persons involved. h. Freedom of the accused against sanctions prior to completion of these procedures. In a serious case where the continuation of duties by an accused would disrupt the educational process or would create a serious threat to lives and property, the chancellor may suspend the accused without loss of pay, on good cause shown and incorporated into written findings delivered to the accused. i. The rights of the accused to waive any or all of the peer judgment steps in these procedures and to negotiate a settlement with appropriate administrative officers at any time. j. The right and desirability of the divisional dean, after receiving a committee report (or in the absence of such a report where a hearing has been waived), to request and receive from the department chairperson communications concerning the disposition of the case prior to the divisional dean's taking action; and the similar right of the provost for academic affairs to communicate with the divisional dean and the department chairperson. M. Revision of Bylaws -- Revisions of these Bylaws may be proposed by Faculty Council. Proposed revisions shall be presented and discussed at a meeting of the general faculty or a faculty forum. As soon as possible after the general faculty meeting or faculty forum, all faculty members will be notified of the proposed revision and provided access to a ballot. Ballots will be tabulated by a committee of Faculty Council within two weeks following completion of voting. A simple majority of the votes submitted will be required for approval. Results of the vote will be reported to Faculty Council and then all faculty members as soon as feasible. Revisions become effective upon approval by the Board of Curators. FINANCE COMMITTEE Greg E.

Approved by the Board of Curators: Feb 4, 2021 April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -1 Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Update UM At the April Board of Curator's meeting, Vice President for Finance Ryan Rapp will provide a preliminary update on the development of budgets for FY 2022. The Board of Curators will approve the operating budget at the June meeting. The universities remain focused on responding to the pandemic and emerging as stronger institutions on the backside of significant disruption faced over the prior year. Moving f orward , the universities must shift focus to building institutions that deliver a quality, research focused education to the students of Missouri. The f uture success of each institution depends on the ability to deliver upon this quality, or the universit ies risk losing significant assets built over the past 50 years in the form of Missouri's research university system. Executive Summary State support and net tuition provide the foundation of public higher education budgets. Tuition caps in Missouri limited growth in tuition while state support stagnated with national trends. When looking at these resources combined on a per student basi s, growth in resources for public higher education in Missouri is 22% below the national average for public universities.

Missouri has the lowest percentage of state budget allocation to Research, Agricultural Extension Programs, and Medical Education; key components of the University of Missouri's institutional mission. Figure 2: Percentage of State Budget on Research, Agriculture, and Medical Missions Source: SHEEO These resource constraints have impacted quality. The university needs to focus on improving resources and outcomes for students and the State of Missouri. Introduction Tuition and fees will continue to be the primary revenue source for the University of Missouri over the next decade; tuition and fees, along with state support , will serve as the cornerstone to sustain quality research universities for the State of Missouri. Leadership of the University of Missouri has a bold vision for excellence, with a goal to significantly improve our research competitiveness, student succes s, and stature on the national stage over the coming decade. Investment in excellence requires new resources to couple with prioritization of existing resources. Historical low increases in sticker prices, coupled with OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -3 low state support, limited the ability for Missouri universities to address both access to programs and quality of those programs. In the following narrative, we will demonstrate: 1) Economic models are changing in public higher education and Missouri is further ahead in this area. The univ ersity's revenue strategies will need to be market based and focused on outcomes. 2) Missouri has not followed the national narrative of higher education, but that has also come at a cost. The State of Missouri is losing some of the best and brightest students to surrounding states. 3) Being a nationally recognized public research university requires refocus ing on mission supported investments. Quality of the degree s offered cannot degrade as we support the university's access and research missions. 4) The university's work is truly meaningful and valuable to the State of Missouri, and a large return for both the State of Missouri and university students is delivered consistently. 5) A market -based pricing strategy for the university's institutions and degrees i s a must and there is a plan to get there. The increase in this year's tuition proposal is the first step in the process. To accomplish the university's vision for excellence, bold plans will be needed to improve academic revenues including tuition, state support, and research. This also involves changing the approach to the state and getting citizens of Missouri and their representatives in government to better understand the value of the university. The university needs to reinvest in Missouri higher education and differently than in the past. Missourians deserve to receive what they pay for and the plan is to show every Missourian what they get from the University of Missouri. The environment for higher education continues to evolve, and funding for public higher education continues to shift in this evolution. As economic models shift, each institution must make trade -offs and set priorities to adapt to the economic model. The \"iron triangle\" provides a conceptual model to frame key tradeoffs that leaders, boards, faculty, and constituents grapple with related to higher education: Factors have a reciprocal relationship . Changes in one factor will affect the others. Quality Cost Access April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -4 Each of these factors is linked in an unbreakable reciprocal relationship, such that change in one will inevitably impact the others. Increases in tuition to fund quality improvements or prevent erosion from state cuts impact low -income students' ability to access degree programs. Conversely, cuts in state funding could be managed by cutting down access to the highest cost degree programs rather than raising price, although this option is rarely explored by institutions. Criticisms of the iron triangle include the fact it does not address administrative cost, and technology provides a key disruptor that could cause the relationships to break down. While both criticisms have a level of validity, they do not address the core of a university and what a university looks to accomplish. At the University of Missouri, there is a focus on increasing performance on research ranking, improving graduation rates, and graduating students in a shorter period of time with good job prospects. Based on these factors, the University of Missouri has some of the best public institutions in the state; however, the university is behind surrounding state universities of similar scope. The Changing Economic Model for Public Higher Education Over time, the student share ( proportion of total education revenues at public institutions coming from net tuition revenue) has increased in every state. Nationally, the student's share of total education revenues was 46% in 2019 compared to 36% in 2008. In an issue brief published by the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) Post-recession Trends in Higher Education Revenues 2019, 16 states have yet to reach pre- recession total education revenue levels. T otal education revenues refer to the sum of education appropriations ( excluding funds for research, agriculture, and medical) and net tuition (excluding tuition used for capital debt service). Missouri, Louisiana, and Nevada lag pre- recession levels by at least 10%. Figure 3: Per -Student $4,000$4,500$5,000$5,500$6,000$6,500$7,000$7,500$8,000$8,500$9,000 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Missouri U.S. Midwest April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -5 Missouri moved from 10% below the national average and at the average for the Midwest in-state support per FTE student in 2008 to $2,000 or 25% below the national average and $1,400 below average for the Midwest in 2019. Over this same time period, the University of Missouri System took a higher share of state cuts, further impacting its resources as compared to peers in surrounding states. Additionally, Missouri's higher education funding policy does not account for mission variation and cost to deliver upon those mission differences, unlike many surrounding states who dedicate more to these areas. Figure 4: Percentage of State Budget on Research, Agriculture, and Medical Missions Source: SHEEO Figur e 4 shows the share of the state budget spent on Research, Agriculture, and Medical programs for public higher education institutions. These portions of appropriations generally go to doctoral institutions with high levels of research and land grant missions. Missouri is last in appropriating funds for these purposes. These appropriations represent differentiation in state funding for differences in mission. As noted in figure 4, most states differentiate funding for differences in mission, especially in the states bordering Missouri. In figure 4, only Illinois falls below the national average in the share of appropriations and four of the eight surrounding states fall in the top 20% in their prioritization of funding for their doctoral institutions. When coupled with tuition limits, this has hampered the ability of the University of Missouri to differentiate from the field of other four -year institutions. If this trend continues on both the tuition and state support front, research competitiveness for Missouri's public universities will be challenged. Missouri risks losing access to a high quality, publicly governed, research driven college degree. - FIN - INFO 1 -6 Figure 5: Net Tuition Per -Student Over Time 2008-19 Source: SHEEO Figure 5 represents net tuition paid by students over the same period. Missouri's public institutions generated $5,590 in net tuition per FTE in 2019 which is 19% less than the national average and 36% less than the average for the Midwest. The Midwest contains the Big 10 and some of the best public institutions in the United States, institutions that are members of the Association of American Universities and compete on the national scale. Missouri has always been on the lower end of pricing in the Midwest. Since 2008, Missouri has fallen further with net tuition per student now falling well below national averages. Underneath these numbers, the University of Missouri is a significant contributor to this fall, as tuition has not grown at near the rates of those with whom the university competes in surrounding states and on a national scale. Figure 6: Percentage change in resources per student, 2009-2019 Source: SHEEO $5,590$6,902$8,744 $4,000$4,500$5,000$5,500$6,000$6,500$7,000$7,500$8,000$8,500$9,000 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Missouri U.S. - FIN - INFO 1 -7 Figure 6 demonstrates total change in resources per student when adjusted for inflation over the past decade for public higher education in all 50 states. As noted in the chart, Missouri ranks last in growth over the decade with a 12% decline over inflation. The national average for public higher education over this timeframe was 15% growth over inflation. In the year -to-year trends, Missouri generally does not rank last, but the impacts for higher education policy have limited the upside for higher education ins titutions in the state. The cumulative impact of this policy has resulted in the largest drop in resources for institutions in the state over the past decade. If the Board and State expect excellence from the flagship institution and research universities, this trend cannot continue. HESFA has Driven this Result The Higher Education Student Funding Act (HESFA, or SB 389) passed during the 2007 legislative session and effectively tied tuition increases of Missouri r esident undergraduate students to a maximum of consumer price index. During the 2018 legislative session, the General Assembly passed revisions to HESFA allowing institutions of higher education to increase tuition above inflation when state appropriations fell, up to a cap of 5% above the consumer price index. Statutes have effectively limited the amou nts by which public institutions can increase tuition on an annual basis. The legislature passed HESFA in response to double digit tuition increases amongst higher education institutions in response to the 2000 recession and related cuts. HESFA does maintain a waiver process allowing the Commissioner of Department of Higher Education Workforce Development to grant a waiver for an increase above inflation, though this process has been rarely used and has resulted in other consequences, such as a withhold from the Governor. Outside of the tuition cap, HESFA has a less discussed provision allowing institutions below average tuition to come up to the average (and increase tuition above CPI) without a formal waiver from MDHE. This provision is actually the most problematic for the University of Missouri. The provision assumes the pricing strategy of institutions with different missions and strengths should all be the same, when national data suggests otherwise. Since its passing in 2007, HESFA has served as a limiting factor on pricing for institutions above the average; those below the average, HESFA has not served as much of a limiting factor and those institutions have had the freedom to adjust tuition as they see fit, although the market increases at four- year baccalaureates is very different than market increases for four -year doctoral. This provision of HESFA has both explicitly and implicitly limited the University of Missouri's ability to increase tuition to fund investments in quality. As peer resea rch universities in surrounding states have been able to increase resident undergraduate tuition as they've seen fit, the University of Missouri has been limited by an inflationary cap for over a decade. Compared to what has happened in other states, the higher education market in Missouri has flipped with lower -level institutions increasing tuition more than the higher- level institutions. This shows up in changes in net tuition outlined for Missouri above, as the portion of the market that could increase prices was statutorily limited in doing so.

Note: USNWR classifies institutions as either \"regionally\" competitive if they are masters or baccalaureate institutions and \"nationally\" competitive if they are doctoral institutions with research expectations. Institutions with the biggest drop in the rankings are the doctoral universities. These were the universities that started HESFA with the most resources and highest tuition. Since inception, they have borne the largest share of cuts and had the least ability (statutorily) to increase tuition. Table 2: Change in Resident Tuition by institution 2007-2020 Table 2 demonstrates changes in resident undergraduate tuition as reported by the Missouri Department of Higher Education. On average, four -year baccalaureate institutions were able to increase their tuition by 50% from 2008- 2020. University of Missouri institutions averaged an increase of 33% over this timeframe, largely due to public policy limits. This trend flipped the market in Missouri. Whereas, in the national marketplace, doctoral April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -9 institutions were able to outpace their masters/baccalaureate counterparts; in Missouri, masters and baccalaureates were able to increase prices while docto ral institutions were held back. When coupled with limited resources for mission differentiation, our public research universities have struggled to find resources to invest in research, professional degrees , and outreach. Missouri's doctoral institution s have fallen behind border states The preceding sections showed information for entire states and blended all four -year institutions together, the following section will compare resources based on the type of institution. As noted above, there is signif icant variation in resources based on the type of institution, with research and doctoral universities charging and receiving significantly more than their counterparts who issue bachelor's or master's degrees as the highest offering. The spread in tuition between comprehensive research universities and their four - year counterparts has continued to widen nationally. Competition on price amongst institutions is increasing as state subsidies decline. Student consumption patterns continue to show a recognition towards quality, with doctoral degree granting institutions seeing lesser declines in enrollment than master's institutions, even with price increases well above inflation and significant differentiation in pricing.

Overall, the University of Missouri's resources per student are 11% or $2,359 less than the surrounding state average for these institutions.

Illinois was excluded because its medical school is located with University of Illinois in Chicago. Tennessee, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Arkansas have a separate medical university located in the major metropolitan area for the state. This chart pulls in the \"medical\" portion from the \"Research, Agriculture, and Medical\" appropriations from Figure 6 above. For comparison purposes, these separately appropriated medical universities were combined with the flagship institution to generate an institution with a similar look to MU. In some cases, these medical programs are included with their flagship in research rankings. Figur e 8 demonstrates MU's resources are significantly lower than surrounding states for institutions with a medical school. Medical schools play a significant role in driving research for public research universities. Over half of research dollars competitively awarded by the federal government are in Life Sciences, with majority of Life Sciences relating to medicine. Doctoral institutions provide quality, valuable degree In 2019, the median income for families headed by a four- year college graduate was more than twice the median income for families headed by a high school graduate. Bachelor's degree recipients had median earnings 76% ($24,388) higher than those with high school diplomas in 2019 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019 American Community Survey Earnings in the past 12 months adjusted for inflation, TableID S2001).

As individuals earn more education, earnings increase, and unemployment decreases. Earnings are best for individuals with a doctorate or professional degree. The University of Missouri System is the primary source of public professional degrees for Missouri. Professional degrees are the most expensive degrees for higher education institutions to confer, and struggle the most under tuition or state appropriation resource constraints. Many doctorate or professional graduates will earn more than six figures and contribute significantly to the state's tax base and economic activity.

Only Truman State University generates salary outcomes above average together with the University of Missouri System of institutions. Given the University of Missouri grants over half of the public degrees in the state, the university has a significant impact on workforce outcomes. Additionally, one has to ask the question of why does the university that generates an average salary of $72k have its pri ce bound by an institution that generates an average salary of $30k? The same public policy allows the institution with a $30k salary to increase tuition without approval, while holding the $72k salary institution to guidelines requiring additional approval.

The analysis is a net present value calculation, taking into account the tuition and costs of living paid by students for a degree and then comparing those payments to the average increase in lifetime earnings from the degree granting institution. The dollar figure represents in a single number how much better off financially a student is as a result of obtaining a degree from the insti tution listed. This study looked across 4,500 institutions ; Missouri S&T was ranked in the top 50 institutions for the best long- term net economic gains. Even with some of the highest tuition in the state, all institutions in the University of Missouri S ystem rank above average for the state having four of the five highest returns on investment in the state as a result of the strong salary outcomes. Since the Enactment of HESFA, Student Migration Patterns Shifted Since the enactment of HESFA, students have tended to migrate out of Missouri. Figures 14 and 15 represent the net student migration patterns for research universities. A - FIN - INFO 1 -14 number means that many more students left Missouri for that state than came into Missouri from that state.

To every other surrounding state, Missouri lost more students in 2008 than in 2018. Additionally, migration patterns towards higher priced southeastern schools only increased. These net migration patterns invariably impact Missouri's future workforce, as students are more likely to find careers in the states where they attend college. Lack of Resources has Impacted the University's Quality and Competitiveness The ability to generate tuition and state appropriations has a strong link to an institution's research profile. Higher tuition and state support allow universities to hire more productive faculty that are further supported through productive research work. Research also requires investment as university research has always been a partnership with the federal government. For every dollar in research generated, the university spends an additional $0.20, and this funding needs to come from somewhere. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -16 Figure 14 Relationship between state support and net tuition per student and research Source: IPEDS, gold represents MU, blue Kentucky, and orange Tennessee Figure 14 above clearly demonstrates research correlates strongly with net tuition and state support per student. The ability to generate resources from state support and tuition impacts the ability to generate research outcomes. The li mits on tuition and limited state resources inevitably impact research performance at University of Missouri institutions if these trends cannot be reversed. With support of the Board, the university has bold plans to invest in research growth to improve the university's profile and remain competitive with other research universities. For MU, improving research competitiveness will be a key to its continued status as one of the top public research universities in the U.S. 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 17,000 19,000 21,000 23,000 25,000 27,000Research per Student Resources Per Student (State Approps & Tuition) April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -17 Table 3: Resource changes to changes in quality rankings FY00 FY10 FY20 NSF Total R&D Expenditures Support (Nominal $) $210.5M T/TT Faculty 19:1 25:1 29:1 As demonstrated in Table 4, continued limitations in state support and net tuition have led to: Declining rankings in research competitiveness Declining numbers of faculty Flat enrollments Increasing student to faculty ratios None of these measures are congruent in maintaining competitiveness with the best public higher education institutions which benefits the states they are in by providing a high-quality workforce. The u niversity's leadership is now setting a clear direction prioritizing institutional quality for the betterment of the state. The university has successfully balanced budgets and turned a hard focus on administration, but that alone will not solve issues facing the university. Administrative cuts alone cannot solve the problems and improve quality. It is now time attention is turned to improving quality and maintaining institutions all Missourians can be proud of. The university's research profile helps attract the best and brightest faculty, and retain the best and brightest faculty. Positive research performance is correlated both with improved access (as measured by Pell student populations) and improved graduation rates for students: April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -18 Figure 15: Research to Graduation Figure 16: Research to Pell share Better faculty lead to a more engaged student body, improving outcomes. Institutions with higher research generate more resources and are better able to support access for the most financially needy students. These institutions have the highest tuition prices, but also have the largest aid budgets to fund their missions to maintain access for students from a lower socioeconomic status. Figure 14 indicates there must be sufficient tuition and state revenue to support research (you can have quality and access at a higher cost). FY2022 Planning Assumptions Overall, financial outcomes for FY 2022 appear to be stabilizing on the backside of the pandemic, with one key area of uncertainty. Fall enrollments remain difficult to predict, and where the universities land on enrollments will have a significant impact on tuition and auxiliary revenues. Applications have been slow across the country this year and are starting to pick up, but it remains difficult for the universities to make a predict ion. Assumptions around federal and state revenue streams have solidified as the state and country start to move past the worst parts of the pandemic. Signi ficant federal stimulus has provided the universities and the state with a buffer to adapt to the changes. Each university is currently underway in building budgets, utilizing the following key assumptions: State Appropriations will be flat to prior ye ar, budgeted at the level set within the Governor's recommended budget. Tuition and Fees should increase at a minimum of inflation. Any increases above inflation should have a business case attached and relate to the market for the program or the Univers ity. Federal Stimulus money is limited to what is known as of April 2021. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -19 Auxiliary Enterprises should operate at a positive margin. For any with a sustained loss, the university should evaluate whether to continue the operation. Compensation budgets should reflect the priorities of the university. Pay increases should be performance based. Any staffing reductions should reflect priorities and should be tracked to reflect where the university is making investments. Capital budgets should reflect the University's approved capital plans. Each university is expected to submit a balanced budget for approval at the June meeting. Some universities took enough permanent cost action in FY 2021 to balance budgets on a sustainable basis and are ready to grow for FY 2022. Others took more temporary actions and more permanent action will be necessary to balance budgets over the longer -term. The degree of action will largely depend on where enrollment numbers and mix fall. Finding academic revenue growth remains a challenge for all of the universities in the University of Missouri System, especially with stagnant state support and statutory tuition limits. After the FY 2022 budget process, Finance will spend the fall completing the five -year financial plans for each university and the health system. In this year's cycle, each university's financial performance targets will be reset to reflect expected financial performa nce when balanced against desired strategic initiatives, including a renewed investment in academic and research excellence. Past periods of slow revenue growth have eroded the quality of Missouri's public research universities, and the university will ne ed to shift investment mindset and revenue growth to improve excellence in academics. Federal Support Provides Temporary Lift to Revenues Public higher education across the nation and in Missouri received significant support to help weather the COVID Crisis. Much of this support has provided a temporary relief valve to deal with revenue disruptions caused by the pandemic. However, these re venue streams are only temporary and each university is treating these resources as one -time resources to cover unexpected costs related to the pandemic. Table 4: Federal Stimulus Funding $'s in thousands FY 2020 FY 2021 (est.) FY Federal Support Funding Relief Fund 9,855 Coronavirus Relief Fund 57,264 Coronavirus Relief Fund for Remote Learning 3,335 Federal Budget Stabilization Fund M&R 36,939 Total $47,286 $167,258 $103,817 April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -20 This federal and state funding allowed the university to provide additional financial aid to students, recover unbudgeted expenses related to reopening the universities, supported infrastructure for remote learning, and fund deferred maintenance across the four institutions. The university's leadership team is ensuring these one -time funds are being applied to the highest priorities, first responding to the pandemic and then addressing other long- term infrastructure needs in the form of state's M&R funding . Note the funding targeted toward FY 2022 represents funding from the federal government passed in March 2021 and some of these amounts may be spread into FY 2021 depending on needs. Even though revenues increased significantly with the stabilization funding, each university still took significant cost action over the past year to rebalance recurring operations to new realities. State Budget Stable in the Near -term, Challenges Ahead in Long -term Our business model will continue to shift away from public funding and towards market competitive revenues and funding. The State's budget will continue to struggle with limited revenue growth and expanded mandatory programs from voter -passed ballot initiatives. This will place pressure on higher education budgets from the State. Higher Education will not be immune from any challenges, as it encompasses roughly half of the state's discretionary budget. Figure 17: Governor's Operating Budget by Funding Restrictions Missouri's economy performed similarly to the national economy since the start of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Personal income received a strong boost during 2020 from federal April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -21 stimulus payments , while wages initially declined in the second quarter of 2020; by the third quarter state revenu es grew 2.0% over prior year. FY 2021 general revenue growth is forecasted to be 14.2%, this significant increase is due to income tax return filing due dates being pushed from FY 2020 into FY 2021, resulting in two years of tax payments being collected i n one year. The Governor's FY 2022 budget is based on a forecasted decline of 4.1% in income tax collections. The Governor's recommendation restores the university's appropriations to FY 2020 core level. With higher -than-expected income tax receipts and federal stimulus funding, the state's revenue budget appears solid for FY 2022 and possibly FY 2023 if trends continue. However, the following quote from Dan Haug, State Budget Director, foreshadows the challenges should these revenue gains prove to be short lived: \"We were able to get the Medicaid expansion into the budget this year without having to cut other programs, but I'm very concerned that the ongoing expenses it's going to put on the state budget are going to crowd out our ability to spend on other important programs in the state such as education going forward. While we didn't have to make cuts in this initial budget, I am very concerned about what it's going to do to our budget in the future.\" Enrollment for Fall 2022 Remains Difficult to Predict for Universities Enrollment for fall of 2022 remains uncertain. Nationally, application and admission trends at the most prestigious universities have seen significant increases over the fall of 2021 and over historical averages. The best and most selective institutions continue to outperform the overall market. A recent article from Inside Higher Ed highlighted the following key findings from an analysis of applications: Applications to larger institutions (>20k students) were higher than applications to smallest institutions (<1k students) More selective institutions (<50% admit rate) generally saw larger increases in application volume than less selective institutions Applicants are applying to more colleges this year, with a 9% increase in number of applications per student The Northeast and Midwest remain challenged to grow Low- income students appear to be the most impacted by the pandemic and are seeing the biggest drop- offs in applications. In normal years, lower income students tend to be later in submitting applications, and that appears to be even more prevalent this year. Many institutions are moving deadlines and changing practices to try and generate more yield, including eliminating requirements for standardized tests. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -22 Current enrollment trends for the fall reflect these national trends, with S&T seeing growth over prior year, MU down slightly, and UMSL and UMKC down significantly over this point in the process from prior year. However, each university is focused on enrolling their class and taking actions to improve admissions and yield. Each university is building t heir budget with a realistic enrollment estimate and ensuring appropriate cost actions are taken to keep budgets balanced, if necessary. The University of Missouri Took Action to Balance Budgets In the wake of COVID -19 and anticipated economic consequences on the State of Missouri and on its public higher education, the University of Missouri took significant actions to preserve the institution's resources . Excluding the hospital, the University has cut $53M in expense over prior year across all categories, with staffing reductions encompassing the entirety of this reduction. From December 20 19 to December 2020, the University has reduced 946 positions or 8%. Those positions fall across the following job groups: Table 5: Staff Headcount Staff Headcount as of December 2019 2020 Change System Administration 654 608 -946 The 946 eliminations include : 12 Executives 206 Business Administration and Support Services 220 Office and Administrative Support These reductions follow a multiple year focus on reducing administrative cost. Each university has significantly trimmed administrative cost over the past five years across economic hardship from falling state support, enrollment shocks, and the pandemic. While the university can always do better related to administrative overhead costs, many of the largest opportunities have been realized. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -23 A Decade of Continued Focus on Efficiency and Significantly Reduced Administrative Budgets The university's revenue picture has shifted over the past decade, with limited state budgets and limited tuition increases restraining universities' ability to grow spending on the mission areas of instruction, research, and public service. In total, revenues related to auxiliary operations including healthcare operations, student housing, athletics, and bookstores have seen growth over the past decade, mainly centering on the healthcare enterprise. These revenue pressures have invariably flowed into the university's cost structure, forcing decisions to balance budgets. Figure 18: Percentage Breakdown of the University's budget by Functional Area Source: IPEDs Finance As demonstrated in Figure 18, nearly half of the university's spending relates to auxilia ry and healthcare operations. Another 35% relates to the primary mission areas of instruction, public service, and research. The remaining areas in blue represent functions in support of the mission: Academic Support (5%, $175M): includes expenses incurred to support the institution's primary missions of instruction, public service, and research. Examples of expenses classified in this category include libraries, museums, academic technology, academic administration (deans), and ancillary support.

Examples of expenses classified in this category include enrollment management, student health centers, student newspapers, intramural sports, financial aid, admissions, and student records administration. Institutional Support (5%, $180M): includes expenses for management of the enterprise and related key support functions. Examples of expenses classified in this category include finance, human resources, administrative information technology, legal services, executive leadership, development/advancement, and marketing/public relations. Institutional support generally encompasses \"central administration\". Figure 19: Institutional Support Share by University Source: IPEDs Finance Figure 19 shows the share of institutional support by university. 78% of institutional support spend occurs on the four universities rather than at the System. Note both MU and UMKC spend more on their individual universities than System Administration in total. This is largely reflective of the broad array of support activities included in institutional support, and reflects the amount of individual focus already present across the four universities.

Figure 20 demonstrates the change in spending by function from FY2016 to FY2019. Institutional Support and Academic Support had the largest drops over the timeframe, reflecting the university's focus on trimming central administrative costs in response to revenue declines from falling enrollment and state support. As the university faces another revenue challenge from the pandemic, the focus remains on cutting these central administr ative costs prior to looking towards mission- related areas of spend. However, there are diminishing returns in administrative cost areas, as these areas have already been significantly cut, making further reductions more difficult to find. Overhead is be coming a more difficult area to balance budgets, as it has been the focus over the past decade for balancing budgets. The preceding analysis focused on functional classifications of spending, and encompassed all types of spending. As an enterprise that focuses primarily on delivery of services, the majority of the university's spend comes from personnel budgets. Any efficiency initiatives or reductions will ultimately necessitate changes in the size of the university's workforce. The following analysis reviews the university's workforce, which encompasses all staff no matter their funding source or location. This view of the data gives a sense of the types of job changes that have been made across the enterprise. -9%-4%-3%0%2% 3%6%9%29% -15%-10%-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35% April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -26 Figure 21: Breakdown of Staffing Sour ce: University Financial Records The critical mass for staffing size and spend is generally located throughout the organization within academic units. Over half of spend and staffing in the organization rests in colleges and schools. The m ajority of staff and spend occurs close to delivery of the mission and is largely controlled by deans and department chairs. The activity analysis performed as a part of the Administrative Review reflected staff perform a broad array of functions to support their units, reflecting relative uniqueness of each operation and related customized support necessary to operate within the higher education environment. Each university made difficult decisions and implemented austerity measures to balance budgets with the demands of each institution's mission. As demonstrated in the table below, the university reduced the labor force by nearly 1,500 positions from December 2017 to December 2020. Job functions of university staff vary greatly, with a wide array of staff performing jobs that support mission delivery; allowing faculty to focus efforts on teaching, research, and public service.

The university is at a key moment for the future. The university struggled to improve quality over the past two decades through successive state budget challenges, an enrollment crisis, and inability to increase tuition due to statutory tuition caps. Instead of waiting for the wave to hit and responding to it, leadership is proactively ma king plans to invest in quality. Instead of getting cheaper, the university is going to get better. Getting better also helps secure market position as a leader in quality education, a necessary position for the universities and the state of Missouri to maintain economic competitiveness. Getting better is going to require: 1) Holding faculty and staff to higher standards, but also compensating them for those standards. 2) Growing research faster than the market, improving the ranking to national public resea rch university peers, as the state has no public institutions with similar research profiles . 3) Increasing tuition to reflect quality improvements, but in a way that is reflective of the market for degrees. 4) Pushing for public policy in Missouri higher education that rewards quality and outcomes. 5) Provide citizens and legislators with a clear picture of what they get for what they spend with the University of Missouri.

The university reported the following in the FY 2009 audit financial report \"Fiscal year 2009 was a challenging year for higher education in general and the University of Missouri, in particular, but not as challenging as the future is likely to be. While many public higher education institutions experienced dramatic reductions in state support for FY 2009 and FY 2010, the University's state appropriations for operations increased by 4.8% in FY 2009 and were held constant year over year for FY 2010. The latter was as a result of a commitment by the Missouri governor and general assembly to hold higher education funding harmless in exchange for no tuition increases. This agreement was possible because of the availability of federal stabilization funds to make up the shortfall in state general revenues. While some federal funding still remains, not enough is available to close the gap for FY 2011 and FY 2012. Without significant increases in general revenues, the state will be challenged to maintain or increase funding for higher education in the future.\" This was the beginning of the university seeing essentially flat revenues. The trend has continued on the state side over the past fourteen years. Since the Great Recession, there has been no growth in the university's appropriations. Based on the Governor's recommendation , the university's recurring state appropriations will be essentially equal to FY 2008 appropriations, in nominal dollars. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -29 Figure 22: Growth since 2008 in State of Missouri Net General Revenue Collections and UM Recurring State Appropriations After funding higher education in FY 2008- FY 2010 with targeted federal stabilization funding, the state's support for higher education fell behind as revenue collections grew while support for higher education remained flat as other mandatory budget items crowded out higher education funding. The university has already seen the federal stimulus funding coming through in FY 2020 and 2021, it is anticipated a third round of funding from the federal government will be received this fiscal year. However, as experienced with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, these funds will run out. The university needs to start making progress with the state now, and to take a different approach. The university need s to advocate to not only preserve our funding, but for developing a model that rewards higher education for delivering right outcomes for the State. The FY 2020 Tuition and Fees information item has significantly more detail on tuition and fee history and strategy, but it also cannot be understated how important this revenue stream will be for the future of our universities. Since 2010, Missouri Resident Undergraduate students have only had two tuition increases that exceeded inflation (FY 2012 and FY 2020), and these same years corresponded with significant cuts in state support. Over the last decade, there have only been two years where tuition and state support increases when added together have exceeded inflation. Conversely, there have been three years over the past decade where the combined change in tuition and state support was more than 10% below inflation. The University of Missouri cannot maintain excellence when resource growth continues to force trade- offs on investment that do not reflect market forces for research UM Recurring State Appropriations Recession April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1 -30 Missouri will continue the national trend towards market -based competition for students, with pricing and demand driving the economics for each of our universities. It is imperative for university academic leaders to understand what drives the economics of their programs, and budgets are a ligned to the economics that drive the institutions while still reflecting the unique missions. The university need s to get pricing strategies right, and needs to understand where students and citizens see value in our institutions. The University of Missouri will direct cost savings and revenue increases to maximize value to the citizens of Missouri, and investments should reflect differentiation of mission for Missouri to remain competitive on a national scale. The university does not want to be in the position ten years from now looking back wondering why investments were not made in our institution to achieve excellence. To successfully invest in excellence in a market -based environment for public higher education, the university will need to: 1) Understand the universities ' teaching mission, program markets, and margins on those progra ms and leverage this to grow resources for the institution 2) Track returns on internal research investments in generating external dollars and develop a funding model to reflect the life cycle of research and keep the institution on leading edge of key fields 3) Balance and modernize the land grant mission in line with teaching and research 4) Identify the intersection of teaching, clinical care, and research to fund continued growth and synergies between medical programs. 5) Manage auxiliaries to a positive f inancial margin .

Progress on long-term tuition plans was delayed due to resources being redirected to COVID -19 budgetary matters. Each university has provided an update on progress towards a new pricing model. The current tuition structures across the four universities don't provide predictability for students and parents. Thus, the rate structures need to be improved to encourage faster degree completion to better meet the state's workforce needs. Undergraduate resident approved tuition rates are recommended to increase by 6.4% which is the allowable increase approved by the Higher Education Student Funding Act (HESFA) . Cognizant of the important need to provide an affordable, high- quality education , only portions of the assessed 6.4% increase will be charged to the student. The increase in tuition will be used to make investments to meet the important mission of student success, research excellence and meaningful engagement. As outlined in the Budget Information Item, low sticker prices, coupled with low state support, limits the ability for institutions to address both access to programs and quality of those programs. This year's moderate increases to students reflect a shift towards moving price up to maintain quality at the University of Missouri. Undergraduate nonresident and graduate tuition rates are proposed to increase from 5% to 2%, except for S&T 's graduate rate which is proposed as flat.

Nonresident - FIN - INFO 2-3 TRENDS IN PRICING FOR MISSOURI RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES The Changing Pricing Model for Public Higher Education The cost of college is about more than just tuition. Students are dedicating a period of time in their lives to better themselves and they are foregoing immediate earnings and incurring living costs in addition to tuition they pay to the institution. In the United States, public higher education systems receive significant support from state government to subsidize cost of degrees and support research and public service missions. The total list price for a college degree varies significantly based upon t he type of institution and its role within the marketplace for higher education. Tuition and fees serve as the primary variable differentiating list price for an education by sector. T uition and fees largely reflect market position of the institution a gainst peers and its strategy in how to attract students. For public institutions, this tends to be more nuanced with states contributing significant resources and setting policy that may limit pricing flexibility. In addition to tuition and fees, students incur the costs of books and supplies and costs of living they may not otherwise be able to fund while going to school full- time. Tuition funds the core of a student's education. Tuition is less than half the cost of education at public institutions, largely due to availability of state support. Figure 1: Average Estimated Full- time Undergraduate Budgets (Enrollment -Weighted) by Sector, 2020-21 Source: College Board's Trends in College Pricing The time to complete a degree can also have a significant impact on the non -academic costs of going to college. Not only does the student pay additional living expenses for additional time spent earning a degree, they also forego earnings if their college degree takes longer than expected. Among students who began their studies full time at a four -year institution for the first time in 2013, 41% had completed a bachelor's degree at their first institution after four years and 62 % had completed a degree after six years (NCES, Digest of Education Stati stics 2020, Table 326.10). S tudents who do Tuition and Fees Room and Board Books and Supplies Transportation Other Expenses April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-4 most likely to default on loans and run into financial and other difficulties in the future. Clearly for colleges, it should not just be about enrolling students, but rather graduat ing students with workforce ready degrees at a reasonable price to degree value. Figure 1 indicates the average cost by sector ; Figure 2 indicates total tuition and fees (blue bar in F igure 1) by Carnegie classification . In general, doctoral granting institutions charge undergraduate students higher rates of tuition than bachelor's or master's degree granting institutions. Doctoral institutions tend to be more research -intensive universities with higher- level degrees, even at the undergraduate level. Doctoral institutions typically grant a higher proportion of degrees in higher cost fields such as medicine and engineering, with a more research -intensive focus. Degrees from a research institution prepare the workforce for the new higher tech economy and job market , and generate the most earnings for the degree holder. Figure 2: Average Publish Charges (enrollment weighted) or Full- Time Undergraduates Source: College Board's Trends in College Pricing Over the past decade, the College Board found price increases at doctoral institutions significantly outpaced spending at other four -year universities and two- year community colleges. Over the same time, public doctoral institutions were able to increase the list price of tuition twice as much as bachelor's colleges. These pricing differences have largely reflected drops in state support coupled with improved earnings prospects for graduates of doctoral institutions. On average, the College Board's Trends in College Pricing found published in- state tuition at public four years increased by 16% above inflation over the past decade (2011-2021). In Missouri, this trend has actually been flipped due to the structure of tuition caps . Master's institutions ha ve been able to increase their tuition at twice the rate of doctoral institutions. The University of Missouri in -state tuition has only increased by 6% above inflation over April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-5 Figure 3 presents the list price comparison of tuition and require d fees for resident undergraduates to flagships and land grants from surrounding states. The University of Missouri institutions remain grouped close to the mid- point for pricing compared to surrounding states. The average resident tuition for the surrounding states is $9,469. Each University of Missouri institution is below that average for the fall of 2020. In looking to surrounding states, there is room for University of Missouri research universities to increase sticker price and still remain comp etitive. In 2021, the University of Tennessee maintains an hourly rate of $378 per credit hour and the University of Kentucky maintains a rate of $ 464 per credit hour for resident undergraduate students. This is significantly more than MU's hourly rate of $306, and even with a 5% increase , MU's new rate of $321 per credit hour remains well below the rates for both institutions. Note: both Tennessee and Kentucky receive at least 20% more on a per student basis than MU in state appropriations. This is all absent any change in state appropriations, as many of the lower priced institutions with higher research (Nebraska, Arkansas) receive more support from their states than MU. Figure 3: Undergraduate Resident Tuition for Surrounding States Academic Year 2020-21 Source: Institutional Research, based on 24 credit hour minimum for full time student designation The preceding analysis focuse s on the list price of the education. It represents the maximum of what students will pay for their education on an annual basis. Higher education institutions use scholarships to further impact price and affordability for students. A common strategy for private institution involves setting a high list price and then utilizing scholarships to provide access to students with a lower socio- economic status or utilizing scholarships to provide discounts to students with an academic background far exceed ing their standards. Public institutions traditionally utilized a low list price strategy with few scholarships, as the state funding was intended to subsidize gaps funded by students at private institutions. W ith limited to declining public appropriations for higher education, more public institutions are deploying discounting strategies similar to FIN - INFO 2-6 utilized by private institutions; this is part of what accounts for differences in tuition amongst publics and privates in the charts above. The marketplace for public tuition will continue to trend towards price competition and increases above i nflation will become significantly more challenging for institutions to pass without impacting demand. The University of Missouri remains well positioned to compete with other research universities in surrounding states for students in high- end degree programs. The University of Missouri institutions need to start competing on both price and degree quality ; without the ability to price the degrees, quality will be at risk. Figure 4: Relationship Between Pricing and US News & World Rankings (USNWR) shown above bars below Source: IPEDS FY20 19 pricing and financial information Figure 4 depicts the difference between resident and non- resident tuition for surrounding state flagships and land grants. G ross tuition is equivalent to the sticker price for the institution and both resident and non- resident rates are listed. The non -resident rate is a proxy for the market price of tuition; those rat es are generally set at public institutions to maximize revenue from that population of students. These tuition rates generally follow the institution's USNWR rankings. Note when non- resident tuition is considered, the University of Missouri is close to the average compared to surrounding states. Overall, MU's USNWR rankings trend towards the middle of surrounding states and non- resident rates do as well.

This process was delayed a year by budgetary concerns from the COVID -19 pandemic. The following section outlines each u niversity's high- level plan to shift their pricing strategy over the coming years. Future tuition and fee strategies will encompass the following principles: Be more student friendly o Simplified bill o Predictab le o Limited pricing variables o Ties to student outcomes o Facilitates retention and completion Generate resources to maintain program quality Be efficient and cost effective to administe r Facilitate achievement of the strategic plan and university mission Focus on the long-term needs of the institution (5+ years) First and foremost, a new tuition structure must be student friendly. The primary revenue source for large public research institutions has shifted from state support to tuition. Competition for students has increased and students have begun to focus on value delivery as they pay a higher share of the cost. The t uition model should also support university retention and completion models, encouraging students to complete degrees on time and graduate. Differential Fee Consolidation and Simplification College degrees clearly increase earnings over a student's lifetime, with the average degree holder earning $1 million more than the comparable high school graduate. Differences in earnings by major are even more stark, Figure 5 presents the difference in earnings by select bachelor's degrees of surrounding flagship institutions. Past tuition strategies of charging a single rate across majors do not reflect these economic differences and the market will shift to reflect these economic realities. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-8 Figure 5: Median Starting Wages for Select Bachelor 's Degrees Source: College S corecard The University of Missouri has differentiated pricing for bachelor's degree programs with supplemental fees for more than a decade. As shown in Figure 5, there is a significant variation in earnings by degree that trends with the cost of education, and differential pricing helps reflect this differentiation. Differential fees have become a standard pricing methodology in public higher education, e very flagship or land grant institution in surrounding states has some form of differential program fees or course fees. Currently, the University of Missouri follows the course fee model whereby the fee is attached to the course rather than the student. In evaluating new models, several of the universities are exploring moving from fees charged at the course level to fees charged based on the student and their major. The current model utilized by the university is the most common in the surrounding market, however, University of Missouri students have voiced a desire to move to something more predictable. Given the current pricing structure of charg ing supplemental fees by individual course, students and parents do not know how much the next semester bill will be until the student enrolls in classes . Many may not understand the fees until they appear on the bill. 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,000 Median Earnings of Students - Received Engineering Degree Median Earnings of Students - Received History Degree Average Engineer Earnings for focus population Average History Earnings for focus population April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-9 Predictability can be enhanced by developing a tuition pricing strategy that has a limited set of pricing variables known to students earlier in the process. Each university's plan includes an element of fee simplification for stud ents. The plans limit pricing variables, with most focusing on pricing at the program level based upon the student's degree, rather than the classes the student selects. This simplification allows the student to know the ir rate per credit hour when they are accepted into a program or declare a major . These fees would not be charged to all students, they will continue to not be subject to the increase cap under HESFA. Plateau Pricing Encourages Completions Tuition plateaus involve fixing the credit hour cost for a range of credit hours, generally with a minimum set around what a university views as a \"full -time\" student. This type of pricing strategy would result in a flat tuition rate for a set range of credit hours. The bottom of the range is usually 12 credit hours, or full -time student status for federal financial aid . Within the plateau, each additional credit hour of consumption above the low- end amount is free to the student. Some models have a cap on allowable hours ; this encourages students to take fuller course loads and progress towards a degree faster. The University of Missouri used a plateau rate from the 1960's through mid -1980's. During this time the plateau range varied beginning with eight credit hours, nine credit hours, 12 credit hours, and 14 credit hours with no maximum number of credits. When converting from a per credit hour tuition rate, it is important for universities to project changes in student credit hour consumption. U niversities implementing plateaus must consider implementing some form of cap on the plateau to ensure students do not take too heavy of a load without appropriate approval. This can either be done with a cap on eligible hours (17 or 18 are not uncommon ending points for the plateau) or a requirement for additional approval to enroll in more than a set number of credit hours. Summaries by University MU The University of Missouri (MU) proposes to adopt a plateaued undergraduate tuition structure that would be differentiated by a student's primary program of study. This structure gives MU the ability to set tuition in a way that reflects the value of the degree and costs associated with offering the programs. The structure would apply to students enrolled in on-campus and distance degree programs. Three to five rates would be established to group programs into comparable tiers, and the 20+ different supplemental course fees currently charged would be eliminated. The Division of Finance is currently working on analysis of cost structures that support undergraduate instruction. This analysis, coupled with demand and current pricing, will provide the framework for tier groupings. The Division of Finance is also working with the financial aid office to assess the net revenue impact of this new structure. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-10 A plateau within each tier will allow students to take from 12 to 18 credit hours per term. The ability to take up to 18 credit hours per term will facilitate student's ability to complete their degree in four years without additional cost. Assessed tuition based on the student's program of study will provide consistency and the ability for students and families to plan for future terms. A plateau per term rate for the 12 to 18 hour range will be established for all undergraduates . New model facilitates the following benefits for students Fee consolidation and simplification - The new proposal will replace multiple lines of tuition and course fees with a flat tuition rate. This one rate will be based on the student's chosen program of study. More predictable pricing for students - The simplified structure will allow s tudents to better manage their financial payment plans. Adding and dropping courses would not generate a change to the student bill unless the se changes result in the student taking fewer than 12 hours or more than 18 hours. Improvement in student outcomes - Establishing a plateau tuition creates a financial incentive to increase their time to completion. As MU transition s to this new model , the goal is to minimize the impact of the cost increase for current students . The most crucial aspect for a successful transition and implementation will be effective communication. Stakeholder engagement for this project will span many constituencies both internal and external to the university. Internal communication began in early 2020 with small focus groups of undergraduate studies, financial aid, admissions, and key faculty and fiscal officers . Through these focus groups, insight was gained into the preferences presented through the tiered model system and potential challenges as MU moves from the current tuition model. MU has and will continue to have students and faculty involved in the vetting process. This feedback will enhance our proposal that will be presented to the Board of Curators. With feedback from the Board, MU would then begin communication with the most critical external constituency, prospective students, and future Tigers, regarding transition to a new tuition structure. Ideally , high school students will be made aware in the fall of 2021 of the intent to change the tuition structure and potential benefits. This communication will outline the general concept as MU continues to solidify specifics of the plateau and tiers through the remainder of spring semester 2022. With specifics of the structure so lidified, MU would communicate the details of the change to high school juniors in the fall semester of 2021, giving families time to fully understand the impact for their students. I n April 2022, rates for fall semester 2023 change in structure would be submitted to the Board of Curators along with the fall semester 2022 tuition and fee increase request. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-11 Communication with prospective students would continue as recruitment efforts intensify for the class of 2023. The Board of Curators would reaffirm the rate structure and approve specific rates for fall semester 2023 at their April 2023 meeting. The first bill for the fall semester 2023 would be generated in July 2023 and due in August. UMKC The Un iversity of Missouri - Kansas City ( UMKC ) has a very robust academic portfolio review process by which all programs are reviewed on an annual basis. Programs are evaluated by demand for the program and applicant yield. This informs decisions around expanding or modifying programs. As part of t his review , data about employment rates, market growth, and average salary were incorporated into the analysis for those programs with high demand. This analysis supports the position that specific programs of study cost more to deliver , as such, tuition could be differentiated and priced accordingly. Predictable pricing could further enhance the student experience. During the summer and fall of 2019, UMKC undertook a comprehensive review of its existing tuition and fees with a view to find strategies to improve the pricing structure, leading to an improved student experience and improved overall performance. In March 2020 UMKC provided an update on work to that point. Based on this review, UMKC has clarity on programs that will sunset, opportunities for strategic investment in new programs, and academic unit restructuring designed to create academic and research synergy. The overarching goal is to provide a clear, simple, and predictable tuition and fee structure that leaves students/families feeling good about their choice to invest in UMKC and simultaneously enhances the financial stability and supports student success. There is expected variability in the approach to tuition and fees among professional schools and programs, reflecting disciplinary norms and diversity in cost associated with program delivery. UMKC's overall strategy and vision for future modifications to the pricing also recognizes there is a correlation between pricing structure and the earning potential of associated degrees, part icularly at the graduate and professional levels. At the undergraduate level the approach is and will be to balance affordability with service and student support, recognizing in some cases , an entry -level degree has higher than average earning potential (e.g., engineering). The evaluation of opportunities to simplify s tudent activity fees is continuing. The proposed mental health and wellness fee, if adopted, will be simpler for students. It is being restructured from a fee per student credit hour up to a maximum number of hours, to a flat fee per semester. This improves predictability for students. UMKC plans to have final vetting for all proposals and work with constituent groups summer and early fall 2022. Final plan will be recommended to the Board for approval spring 2023. If approved, the new rates will be effective fall 2024. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-12 UMS L The University of Missouri - St. Louis (UMSL) is evaluating and planning to implement a tiered fee model for undergraduate students based upon the academic group of the courses in which they enroll. The tiers will bundle together pricing for like programs based upon the cost to deliver and value of the program , and consolidate what are now separate program specific fees. UM SL is in a better position to shift to a differential tuition more easily with fees rolled in, because a significant number of university- wide fees are already included in the tuition rate. B undling of all fees provides a more predictable model for students as they are better able to understand their cost by the declared major. Over the next year UMSL will begin a comprehensive review of its current 43 graduate programs and their respective tuition and fees to identify strategies for improving the pricing structure. During this review programs will be evaluated based on program delivery cost and market demand and then placed into a tier structure. The tiers will bundle together pricing for like programs based upon the cost to deliver the program, value of the program , and consolidate what are currently program -specific fees. Increases in revenue could be generated by market -based pricing as well (as program val ue is considered in program pricing). UMSL has kept the financial reality (see below) of students in the forefront of this plan. UMSL student population also consists of 75% transfer students, many of whom are non- traditional students and over 30% of the students attend college on a part- time basis. UMSL UMKC MU S&T Average Household Income $54,978 $68,985 Based Grant 25% UMSL is proposing a model that would be more student friendly and transparent. The draft model simplifies the pricing variables and makes the student bill easier to predict and understand. It also allows the recruitment office to be able to share a better picture of actual costs for p rospective students. This cost structure would likely include all fees, so students and recruiters would be aware of the cost based on a tiered academic program. The most crucial aspect for a successful transition and implementation will be effective communication. UMSL has and will continue to engage with students and stakeholder groups to understand implications of the plan. Stakeholder engagement for this project will span many constituencies both internal and external to the university. Internal comm unication began in 2020 with stakeholder groups comprised of the Chancellor, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Enrollment Management, Retention, and Student Affairs. Through these focus groups , UMSL gained insight into the preferences presented through the tiered model system and potential challenges as the university moves from the current tuition model. After approval from the Board, UMSL would begin communication with students, faculty , and staff to vet specifics of the new tuition plan. UMSL plans to place em phasis on focus groups with students as part of the engagement plan. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-13 Any shift in tuition models requires thoughtful planning and a transition period for students to adjust to the new model. Therefore, c hanges to the tuition structure will be implemented over a period of time to allow for adequate communication for new students and a period of transition for current students. The expectation of this timeline is to roll out changes with regards to both undergraduate and graduate tiered models in fall of 2022. Tuition changes would be effective fall of 2023. S&T Missouri S&T is considering a plateaued tuition structure with differential program fees for undergraduates majoring in College of E ngineering & Computing programs, Kummer College programs, and laboratory science programs. Students majoring in humanities, social sciences, mathematics, and education programs will not be charged differential program fees. Current plans for the plateau encompass 12 to 20 hours, providing a large range of credit hours to encourage students to take a full load for completion. Charges above and below the plateau will be based upon an hourly rate. In addition, Missouri S&T plans to bundle the IT fee into the tuition rate and combine other mandatory fees charged to all students into two simple fee categories: an Activity & Facility fee and a Health fee. Missouri S&T designed the proposed model to be more student friendly. The draft model simplifies pricing variables and makes the student bill easier to predict. Plateau tuition has the additional benefit of simplifying the refund and course change process, as movements within the plateau do not have to be repriced on the student bill as today's fees do. The new model also facilitates improvements in b oth retention and graduation. The model will encourage students to take a full course load with no marginal cost for enrolling in a full load of 15 hours or more. The plateau rate should: Reduce time to graduation Improve retention and graduation rates Reduce total cost of education and opportunity costs of lost earnings Reduce students taking classes at other universities Reduce student debt at graduation Over the coming year, Missouri S&T will engage with students and constituent groups to understand the implications of the draft plan and craft a final version for board approval in Spring 2022. A pproval of the tuition fee rates will be requested in Spring 2023 and the new fee structure will be implemented in Fall 2023. Any major shift in tuition models requires thoughtful planning and a transition period for students to adjust to the new model.

E ach university plans to increase tuition at a minimum of inflation, but in many cases above where there is a market case for an increase. Revenues from tuition increases will be directed to improve academic quality and research excellence. As presented i n Figure 6, tuition and fees will be discussed in four broad categories, undergraduate tuition, graduate and professional school 's tuition, supplemental fees, and activity, facility and service fees. While supplemental and activity fees serve to help refl ect differential costs, tuition remains as the primary price driver for the University of Missouri. See appendix for full detailed schedules. Figure 6: P ercent of Tuition and Fees by Category Higher Education Student Funding Act (HESFA) Change for Tuition and Required Fees Undergraduate tuition and required fees charged to all Missouri resident students are governed by the Higher Education Student Funding Act (HESFA, SB 807 & 577 passed in 2018 revises Section 173.1003, RSMo, commonly referred to as SB389.) Tuition and required fees include tuition and fees charged to all students. HESFA allows for increases above inflation only if state support declines. The University of Missouri operating state support reduced by $52.8 million from FY 2019 to FY 2020. As the University of Missouri's state operating support decreased, the statute allows for an institution to recoup a reduction in state operating support, up to 5%. Therefore, under this statue the university is allowed an increase of 5% plus an inflationary increase of 1.4%. The University plans to increase rates by the maximum statutorily allowed amount, but waive a portion to ease the burden on students. 54%27%12%7% 0% Facility, and Service Fees April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 2-15 Undergraduate Tuition Resident Undergraduate Tuition The University of Missouri is recommending broad approved resident undergraduate tuition rates increase by the HESFA permissible maximum amount with varied increases to students by university . The following table shows the detail for the total approved rat e down to what the students pay after the across-the- board waiver to temper cost increases : Approved rates will be charged to students but will be reduced by a limited Missouri resident undergraduate tuition waiver. The waiver slows the increases in t uition felt by students, which the University plans to keep around 5% or 2 -3% above inflation over time. The university is committed to providing accessible, high quality education to the residents of Missouri . The university is proposing assessed undergraduate resident tuition rates as follows: UMKC and UMSL have Metropolitan undergraduate tuition rates for students from Kansas and Illinois counties in their market area. UMSL and UMKC also have undergraduate rates which includes the entire state of Illinois and Kansas. The Metropolitan , Illinois , and Kansas tuition rates are proposed to increase the same as Missouri resident rates.

The nursing tuition rate increased by 1.4%; for FY 2 2 tuition will be $622.39 for residents and $1,184.66 for nonresidents. These increases are reflective of the high costs of delivering the program and will place UMKC in the middle of the tuition market among their graduate nursing peers.

MU Law is proposing a 5% increase for residents and a 2.6% and 5% increase for non- residents earning a JD degree and LLM degree, respectively . This change would impact 360 student s and generate new net revenue of $150,000. A panel of student leaders was consulted and reluctantly support this change in light of the harsh budget realities. The additional funds will ensure the quality of the degree offered to the students. MU School of Medicine received approval from the Board to increase tuition by 8% per year over a three -year period beginning FY 2020 for its medical students ; however , due to the pandemic , this rate increase was postponed until FY 2021. The increases will better position the school of medicine with region peer institutions as well as reflect the current demand in medical degrees. The incremental revenue will help offset the high cost of educating thei r selective student base while allow ing the school of medicine to maintain its top tier quality in teaching. MU Veterinary Medicine is proposing a 5 % increase. The MU College of Veterinary Medicine (MU CVM) offers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program comprising four years of study.

MU 's CVM current four-year tuition is $107,596 and $142,881 for in -state and out- of-state, respectively . This proposed increase would keep MU below the national average for both in- state and out -of- state tuition. UMKC Law is proposing an 3.2% increase for JD program and an 3.4% increase for LLM program for FY 2022. The proposed rate increase is necessary in order to contribute to the overall fiscal health of the university while not adversely affecting the ability to recruit quality students. Supplemental Fees Supplemental fees represent 12% of the university's total net tuition and fees. Supplemental fees are presented in the following three categories to facility the discussions around the proposed FY 2021- 22 rates. These fees represent the cost differentials that will be incorporated into future differential tuition models proposed in the \"Long- term Models\" section above. Any increases above the university's average increase have a separate justification for the increase.

This fee applies to all Undergraduate and Graduate Courses 2000- level and above , as well as 1000- level courses with enrollments capped at 49 students or fewer. This fee is not charged to students in large introductory courses (1000- level with 50 or more students). This represents the first year of a multi- year plan to increase course fees. The proposed fee would increase $20 in FY 22, $11.70 in FY 23 and $12 in FY 24. Funds will be used for the modernization of classroom labs and academic advisors. MU School of Medicine Course Fee was approved in FY 20 to increase the per credit hour fee by $40 per year over a two -year period (FY 20 - FY 21). Due to the pandemic , this increase was not assessed in FY21. The second year of the two -year plan will be imple mented in FY22. The incremental revenue will help offs et the high cost of educating their selective student base while allow ing the school of medicine to maintain its top tier quality in teaching. MU is proposing a CVM Clinical Supplemental Fee of $2,000 per semester that is applicable to the third and fourth year of study. Funds will be utilized to ensure adequate supplies and technical support staff are available to train the professional students in clinical procedures. This funding will help imp rove the quality of experiential veterinary education. MU recommends an increase to Sinclair School of Nursing Undergraduate Course Fee of $42.20 per credit hour. This fee will not negatively impact any student currently in the nursing program, the fee will be phased into 5 th semester student s only. The training of health professionals, including nurses, increasingly relies on simulation to supplement clinical training. Students can work with task trainers, high fidelity simulated manikins that replicate r eal life events, and human actors who have been formally trained to mimic a specific disease problem. In a simulated environment, students can work at a pace foster ing deep learning. They can also make mistakes without actually harming a patient. This t ype of environment is essential to training now and into the future. The costs of this training are escalating and include everything from disposable supplies, to highly sophisticated equipment, to trained actors. This fee will provide an additional $243,000 to support this essential clinical training. UMKC proposes an increase of $8 per credit hour to the Engineering Course fee . The increased fee will help fund the materials, equipment maintenance and software within the educational classrooms and laboratories, high performance computing, power electronics, manufacturing and structural laboratories in the new Plaster Center. The fee will cover any in-class cost/use of the facility such as 3 -D printing, maker space or the AR/VR software, but it will also cover a limited amount of out-of- class time and materials so students can create on their own. There will be some restrictions on out -of-class materials due to variability in cost ( to 3-D print titanium is 20 times as expensive as using common resins) . By having a structure for free (limited) use through the additional fees, the students will be inspired to learn the equipment and use the facility to its fullest.

The capital plan contain s two sections, the five -year capital plan included in the five -year finance plan and the strategic development project plan for aspirational strategic project s not currently included in the finance plan. This process allows for execution of the current year plan s and will provide additional time for fundraising, working with legislature, and additional due diligence during years two through five. The capital plans will assist in driving any official fundraising campaigns for capital projects. Major capital projects will be approved by the Board of Curators before being incorporated into any approved capital plans, budget plans, or long-range business plans. Major capital projects include any new construction over $5 million in project cost or any renovation/infrastructure improvements over $8 million in project cost. The capital planning process and investment in existing facilities are two key component s of Facilities Stewardship. Facilities stewardship is about taking a long and broad view of an institution's past and future. The University of Missouri System is comprised of over 1,500 buildings, four primary campuses and a h ealth care system . Total valuation is over $11 billion. Investment to maintain these facilities over the past 15 years has been insufficient. UM education and general (E&G) facilities now have over $1.9 billion in facilities needs (FCN) , resulting in the facilities portfolio being rated below average condition. Due to continued limited funding, we must be deliberate in setting capital priorities to uphold our stewardship responsibility.

Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory Replacement Building, MU The Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (VMDL) Addition project will construct a new facility of approximately 33,600 gross square feet (GSF) directly adjacent to the existing VMDL building which is 21,140 GSF. In conjunction with the new constructio n the project will demolish one existing building a block away, the 40,350 gsf Veterinary Science Building (VSB). The key operational elements of the new facility include a new necropsy & biocontainment suite, incinerator, and diagnostic laboratories. These functions in the current VMDL cannot be modernized to current standards due to structural and size and configuration constraints. New construction of these functions provides the most effective means to satisfy the goals of the project: to improve safety for students, staff and the public; minimize potential contamination; and improve operational efficiencies. This concept better segregates and secures biohazards between the currently shared service yards in the veterinary complex of buildings. The existing VMDL is considered below average condition with an FCNI of .49 and will continue use with support functions of less intensity to those relocating to the new addition. The VMDL is Missouri's only veterinary laboratory accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. Each year, the VMDL performs in excess of 100,000 diagnostic tests, many for agricultural animals as well as companion animals. The VMDL is a major resource to State and national networks to monitor and investigate potential outbreaks of animal diseases such as avian influenza and foot -and- mouth disease; human diseases such as West Nile virus and rabies; cases of brucellosis, salmonellosis, and other diseases that have an impact on animal and public health. The VMDL has established a new collaboration with the Missouri Department of Conservation and is certified to test chronic wasting disease in wild and captive animals. This project will eliminate $ 8.15 million in facilities needs and will increase annua l operating cost by $650,422. Funding for the $30,000,000 project will be $3,640,000,000 from gifts, $11,360,000 from University funds and $15,000,000 from the State. 2. Pickard Hall - Decommissioning and Mitigation , MU Pickard Hall is located on the east side of Francis Quadrangle. Currently, the building sits idle due to regulatory complications surrounding the nearly century old contamination from early research in radium extraction. This project will complete the decommissioning process required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The only way to fully eliminate the long- term liability for MU is to completely remove the building and prepare the site for a future facility. The current building is small, but sits on a site that can support more functions in the heart of campus than the current building allows. Therefore, the site will be prepared for a new signature building location, one which respects history yet provides options for the future. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1-11 The unknown extent of the radium contamination complicates the potential for rehabilitating the building, both in scale and cost. Remediating the contamination necessitates the removal of the basement slab to remove capped piping, removing unknown quantities of brick from the masonry bearing walls, and removing unknown quantities of the wood structural system. These unknowns put the institution at risk for significant cost and time. Complete removal of the building will assure the elimination of the contamination and any regulatory obligations requi ring significant staff oversight and unknown future costs. There is, however, no reason to believe that putting off the decision to remove the building will do anything other than allow potential future costs to increase. Pickard Hall, and the Francis Quadrangle context in which it sits, is important to the physical and emotional fabric of the campus. The intent for future building development is consistency with the architectural characteristics of the surrounding historic district. Providing a redevelopment site in the core of the historic campus allows the opportunity for a flexible and adaptable building supporting the future of the University. This project will eliminate $5. 45 million in facilities needs . The project budget of $12,000,000 will be funded by University funds.

Laboratory for Infectious Disease Research - Addition for CO6 Grant Strategic Development, MU This project will be an approximately 9,000 gross square feet (gsf) addition to the Laboratory for Infectious Disease Research (LIDR) facility. The original building was received matching funds from the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) and began operat ions in 2010. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) CO6 Grant program recognizes the importance of all institutions of higher learning in contributing to the nation's research capacity. The goal of this funding is to upgrade or create novel biomedical research infrastructure to strengthen biomedical research programs. The proposed project must serve the applicant -defined institution -wide biomedical research needs. Each project is expected to provide long- term improvements to the institutional research infrastructure. Targeted are the modernization of core facilities and the development of other infrastructure serving an institution- wide research community on a shared basis. This project will be the MU single submission to the NIH. This addition would provide additional biosafety research laboratories to continue the work to find ways to fight bacterial and viral infections. The project budget of $8,000,000 will be funded by a federal grant. 2. Radioisotope Facility at Discovery Ridge , MU This project will construct a new, 33,000 gross square feet (gsf), single story radioisotope processing facility at Discovery Ridge. The types of spaces include processing and research spaces, laboratories, storage space for waste, shipping and receiving space, conference rooms, classrooms, and office space for Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) and Department of Energy (DOE). The partnership with DOE is under review, and if accepted, DOE will fund the project costs. Details of the real estate agreement will be negotiated as the DOE considers and evaluates the MU proposal. The DOE Isotope Program (DOE IP) has collaborated with the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) for decades. More recently that collaboration has grown such that MURR was one of the first to join DOE IP's University Network. This new partnering approach allows for economical supply of R&D grade Se -75 and Lu-177 by combining unique strengths. Building on the proven partnering abilities and taking a fresh look at core unique strengths of each organization leads to the concept of establishing a DOE Isotope Processing Center (DOE IPC) at the University of Missouri -Columbia. The proposed Center would leverage MURR's competency and experience in the weekly processing and supply of short -lived isotopes as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The project budget of $19,976,000 will be funded by a federal grant. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1-15 3. Laboratory for Infectious Disease Research - Addition for NSF Grant Strategic Development Plan, MU This project will provide an approximately 45,000 gross square feet (gsf) addition to the Laboratory for Infectious Disease Research (LIDR) facility. The original building was constructed from matching funds from the National Institutes of Health and began operations in 2010. National Science Foundation (NSF) supported science and engineering research increasingly relies on cutting -edge infrastructure. With its Major Research Instrumentation program and Major Multi -user Research Facility projects, NSF supports infras tructure projects at the lower and higher ends of infrastructure scales across science and engineering research disciplines. This project is a submission for preliminary proposal and will be considered for potential of full proposal by September 2021. This addition will provide additional biosafety research laboratories to continue the research on bacterial and viral infections. The project budget of $46,090,000 will be funded by a federal grant. 4. Facilities Needs and Operations Reduction Project, MU This project will provide critical exterior repairs to Jesse Hall, Hill Hall, and Tucker Hall; critical mechanical systems replacements for Hill Hall, Tucker Hall, and Medical Science Building; and will demolish ten buildings ( Columbia Professional Building, Loeb Hall, London Hall, Mizzou North, Neff Annex, Noyes Hall, Old Student Health Building, Parker Hall, Pickard Hall, and Read Hall) that are in very poor condition. The project will eliminate over $100 million of facilities needs and allow the Univers ity to reinvest approximately $2.5 million annual operating cost savings. Jesse Hall has stood as a heart of the iconic campus fabric for more than a century. The building has a FCNI of 0.26 with facility needs over $13 million. The project will repai r the exterior deteriorating brick and stone masonry and ornamental and structural painted metal and replace the original wood windows which are in various stages of deterioration. Hill Hall is a core campus building, located near Jesse Hall, has a FCNI of 0.40 and nearly $5 million in facility needs. The project will replace the antiquated mechanical system with a new code compliant system; replace the roof and windows; and provide selective masonry tuckpointing. Tucker Hall is a core campus laborator y building, located near Life Sciences Building, has an FCNI of 0.26 and over $11 million in facility needs. The project will replace the mechanical system, including laboratory exhaust system, waterproof the foundation and provide selective masonry tuckpointing. The Medical Science Building is strategically located adjacent to the University Hospital and provides space for research laboratories related to the Health Sciences, particularly the School of Medicine. The building has a FCNI of 0.46 with faci lity needs of over $47 million. This project would replace ten air handling units that are April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1-16 50+ years old, add two new air handling units to eliminate window air conditioning units, replace ten aged fume hoods, replace steam radiators with a modern mechani cal system, and extend the fire suppression system throughout the building.

Ambulatory Facility/Medical Office Building , MUHC The MU Health Care Ambulatory Facility/M edical Office Building project will construct a four -story clinic building with up to approximately 125,000 to 150,000 gross square feet to accommodate medicine and surgical specialty clinics and departments. The building will be constructed on University owned land. University Hospital currently has a shortage of space needed for high revenue - generating, hospital -based services such as diagnostic cardiology, cardiac catheterization labs, interventional radiology labs, endoscopy labs, etc. This has a negative impact on access and, consequently, patient and referring physician satisfaction. A new ambulatory building will allow for growth of medicine and surgical specialties; decant outpatient services to allow for more profitable, hospital- based services; meet ongoing payer and patient demands for more outpatient- based services, abate leases secured for short -term solutions; and create synergies and efficiencies by consolidating clinics, especially those that now have two locations due to capacity constraints. A current study indicates multiple specialty clinics are nearing or exceeding target utilization, creating significant limitations in terms of growth. Some of the specialty clinics are in prime, high -cost hospital space. A couple of clinics have had to split off into two locations, some of which have required adding leased space, to accommodate physician recruitment needed to meet growing demand. The project budget of $66,000,000 will be debt financed .

This project will build upon the first phase, which renovated about 79,000 gsf and was completed in 2018 and funded by the State with the Board of Public Buildings Bond as the primary funding source. The Phase II renovation will address $26.4 million of additional facilities needs, research spaces, teaching spaces, and other facility deficiencies that were beyond reach of the Phase I budget. The renova tion will provide state of the art teaching laboratories and support spaces, while providing improved laboratory systems to support research activities, support student retention, meet current laboratory standards, and encourage student collaborative learning. The Spencer Chemistry and Biological Sciences Buildings were originally constructed in 1968 and had not been renovated or updated since the 1980's prior to the Phase One renovation which was completed in 2018. These buildings serve Chemistry and Biology undergraduate and graduate majors, as well as those who go into professional schools or graduate studies in medical and dental. They also serve as part of the teaching mission for our Pharmacy, Medicine, and Nursing Programs. The facility is outdated, provides inadequate space for teaching, and does not meet current safety codes and standards. The chemistry department was recently merged into the School of Biological Sciences to create a larger School of Biological and Chemical Sciences.

The project will also add 18,620 net square feet (nsf) in strategic additions for Music and Dance Rehearsal and Practice Rooms for a 33,702 gross square feet (gsf) addition to OPAC. The renovati on will address deferred maintenance, teaching/classroom spaces, and other facility deficiencies. The renovation will provide state of the art teaching and support spaces, support student retention, meet current instructional and safety standards, and encourage student learning. Grant Hall was constructed in 1926 as an elementary school and renovated and expended in 1988 for the UMKC Conservatory programs. Olson Performing Arts Center (OPAC), which contains White Hall, was originally constructed in 1979 and both Grant Hall and the OPAC White Hall have not been renovated or updated since their original construction and renovations/additions. These buildings serve Conservatory undergraduate and graduate majors in music, dance and theatre. The April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1- 28 halls are ou tdated, provide inadequate space for teaching, and do not meet current safety codes and standards. The deficiencies in these halls and the overall condition of the Conservatory facilities are noted factors in the current accreditation reports for the programs and a reaccreditation visit is planned for the fall 2021. This project will eliminate $ 10.1 million in facilities needs and will increase annual operating cost by $422,000. Funding for the $32,900,000 project will be $22,900,000 from gifts and $10,000,00 from the State. 4. Health Sciences Campus/ School of Medicine and School of Dentistry Renovations, UMKC This project consists of two partial building renovations and combines elements from prior Health Sciences Program Planning Studies for the School of Dentistry completed in December 2010, and the School of Medicine completed in November 2010. School of Medicine Building Renovation: The project w ill renovate approximately 33,000 gsf of the 256,300 gsf existing building. The renovation will improve building systems, student spaces and research spaces to meet current standards. This project will address ap proximately $8.3 million in facilities needs. School of Dentistry Building Renovation: The project w ill renovate approximately 33,000 gsf of the 272,759 gsf existing building. The renovation will improve building systems, student spaces, and dental clinic spaces that serve the general public. This project will address approximately $4.2 million in facilities needs. The UMKC Health Sciences District will have state -of-the-art capabilities to conduct research in biomedical informatics and Big Data initiatives in addition to laboratories for clinical research and basic biomedical research in selected areas. These capabilities will complement and enhance the work planned for the MU Translational Precision Medicine Center (TPMC). The Health Science District will enable UMKC School of Medicine and School of Dentistry to be more competitive in the recruitment of high-caliber physician -scientists and dentist -scientists with a track record of extramural grant- funding (primarily NIH funding) and via carefully planned collaborations and combined efforts, enhance the competitiveness of faculty at MU NextGen to compete for extramural grant funding. This project is the initial phase of an overall plan that has the potential to catalyze new collaborations across our region and among University of Missouri academic campuses, and the potential to attract industry partnerships and One Health partnerships to focus on advanced treatments for cancer and cardiovascular disease, and to advance the fields of biomedical engineering, tissue regeneration, and Big Data. The long- term impact of the collaboration between UMKC and MU NextGen will be to accelerate both discovery and implementation of prevention and treatment of disease that will result in improved health outcomes for Missourians. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1- 29 The School of Medicine was constructed in 1971 and many of the building spaces have not seen renovation since that original construction. The School of Dentistry was constructed in 1967 and most spaces were renovated in the late 1990's, but have seen no renovations since then. These buildings serve primarily the Medicine and Dental students, but have support facilities including libraries and core research lab facilities that serve all of the Health Sciences Schools as well as research sciences on the Volker Campus. The facility is outdated, provides inadequate space for teaching, and does not meet current safety codes and standards. This project will eliminate $1 2 million in facilities needs. Funding for the $15,000,000 project will be from the State. 5. 4747 Troost Renovation , UMKC This project consists of the renovation of the 4747 Troost Building to create an integrated location for UMKC's Outreach and Community focused programs. The project would renovate the 54,026 gsf existing building which was construction in 1961. This project will address approximately $6.4 million in facilities needs. The renovated project will allow for the relocation of other programs at 4825 Troost and begin a process of long- term redevelopment that wil l include a combined site and mixed -use development that will include parking and may include retail and housing components in a public private partnership (P3) development. The project also may include related program relocation and redevelopment on nearby sites within and adjacent to the Volker Campus. The UMKC 4747 and 4825 Troost site is currently home to many programs and affiliated organizations that are central to the University outreach and community focus. KCUR Public Radio, KC Rep, KCEZ/ KC Stem Alliance, UMKC Center for Neighborhoods, UMKC Midw est Center for Non -Profit Leadership, UMKC Cookingham Institute, Jumpstart and a few other similar entities are located in these buildings. In addition, the site houses much of the University entrepreneurship and innovation outreaches, led by groups such as KC SourceLink, UMKC Innovation Center, UMKC Solo Incubator Law Office, UMKC Entrepreneurial Law Clinic, and the UMKC Office of Technology Transfer. The existing buildings are in very poor condition and lack public amenities, accessibility, and parking that the programs demand. The renovation project will provide modern spaces for these programs while also providing increased space for research and community education and training. Both the existing and new programmatic uses will benefit from their c o-location and from the tremendous public access provided by being on Troost Avenue with its heavy public transit use and services. Funding for the $8,000,000 project will be from the State. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1- 30 6.

The project w ill replace the Miller Nichols Library boiler plant and the most at- risk portions of the Steam Heating Plant distribution as identified in the updated 2017 Steam System Master Plan . The University of Missouri -Kansas City campus includes three central steam plants, which produce steam for distribution to campus facilities. The central steam plants are located in the Miller Nichols Library, Spencer Chemistry Building, and the School of Education. Each plant provides steam to the surrounding campus buildings through a network of underground steam distribution and condensate return piping. Six of the seven central plant boilers have been in service for over 50 years. Some of the boilers currently have a large number of plugged tubes. The plant feedwater treatme nt systems, which are approximately 20 years old, have internal corrosion and performance deficiencies, which are contributing to the boiler corrosion. The campus steam distribution system ha s a history of maintenance and reliability problems due to age and corrosion. Significant portions of the steam distribution systems for the Miller Nichols and Spencer Chemistry plants have been replaced since 2010 and are in good condition. The remaining older portions of the steam distribution system are nearing the ends of their useful lives. It is possible that the rate of failure and the associated costs will escalate on these older portions of the system. The project will eliminate $10 million of facilities needs. Funding for the $10,000,000 project will be from the State. 7. New Student Housing, UMKC This project w ill construct 500 beds of new student housing primarily focused on undergraduate students in a style and configuration as recommended by the Master Plan currently underway. It is anticipated that the project will be developed through a public private partnership model (P3). The on- campus living experience has been a key recruitment driver for undergraduate enrollment growth at UMKC since 2005. As UMKC's on- campus housing capacity grew from about 360 to almost 1,500 beds, undergraduate enrollment increased about 20% from 6,813 students in Spring 2006 to 8,233 students in Fall 2017. A diversity of housing options allows students at all levels to extend their on -campus experience. UMKC desires to co ntinue to grow their on campus living capacity as a strategic means of continued enrollment growth. Housing on the UMKC Volker campus currently consists of the 559 bed Oak Street Residence Hall and the 329 bed Herman and Dorothy Johnson Residence Hall. Both of these buildings provide suite style living and predominately house undergraduate April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1- 31 students. Ho using on the UMKC Health Sciences District at Hospital Hill consists of 243 beds in the Hospital Hill Apartments. The $45,000,000 project will be financed and developed using a P3 model. 8. Athletics Performance Center Additions and Renovations, UMKC This project expands and renovates existing student athlete performance center spaces within both the Swinney Center and the Durwood Stadium. The project w ill consist of a 25,000 gross square feet (gsf) addition and a 10,000 gsf renovation to the Swinney Center for Men's and Women's Basketball student athlete facilities and offices, as well as weight training and sports medicine facilities for all sports. The project would also replace the existing 10,000 gsf Durwood Stadium Training Facility with a new 30,000 gsf facility which will also include enhanced spectator seating and amenities. The Kansas City Athletics Mission Statement states that \"The University o f Missouri - Kansas City Athletics Department will provide academic, athletic, and personal development opportunities to support student -athletes. We will promote a culture of comprehensive excellence while providing the resources that will enable our student - athletes, coaches, and staff to achieve the highest levels of success. It is our mission to develop the best athletic programs and serve as a great source of pride in representing the UMKC community and Kansas City.\" The proposed facilities will provide a world - class student athlete experience while also providing a rewarding and engaging fan experience for Men's and Women's Basketball at the Swinney Center and Men's and Women's Soccer at the Durwood Stadium.

A large lobby and gallery will display information and exhibits related to campus life and the stude nt experience, using static and interactive displays, video, and full -scale projects. Small conference rooms for meetings with faculty advisors will overlook the lobby/gallery. Serving as the University's front door for visitors, this flexible space for m ultiple events within a highly branded environment, will enhance the public presence of the University. Its location in a newly defined Arrival District will strengthen the campus master plan and create a simplified wayfinding experience for prospective students. Funding for the $12,000,000 project will be $5,000,000 in gifts and $7,000,000 in University funds. 2. Engineering Research Lab (ERL) Addition and Renovation, Missouri S&T The Engineering Research Laboratory (ERL) Addition and Renovation project will construct approximately 86,470 gross square feet (gsf) on the east side of ERL and connect to the north side the Straumanis -James Hall. This will create a research center of approximately 162,540 gsf that will aesthetically anchor the northeast corner of the campus. The project will also address life safety code issues, energy conservation measures and associated cost savings, accessibility issues, as well as upgrade systems i n the ERL. This building will provide additional interdisciplinary research space which has been identified as a high priority in both the Strategic Plan and Campus Master Plan. Since this project will house interdisciplinary research, its impact will be felt campus -wide and affects all degree programs. ERL's Facilities Condition Needs Index (FCNI) is 0.49 with over $13 million in facilities needs. Additional operating costs are estimated to be $517,090 annually and funded by the Campus operating budget. The estimated number of students impacted annually will be 1300. The $43,026,000 project budget will be funded by gifts. April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1-36 3. Manufacture Missouri Ecosystem Building One, Missouri S&T The new Manufacture Missouri Ecosystem Building One will be the first building in the research and development park.

The project will also construct a new 29,750 gsf General Service Building on Fraternity Circle adjacent to the existing Grounds Equipment Storage Building to accommodate offices and shop space for the facilities services uni t. A recent survey of Missouri S&T graduates indicates that the vast majority of students are going on to established companies upon graduation, showing little interest in smaller start-up companies. This is a key indicator that the campus lacks a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial thinking critical for a science and technology focused institution. The purpose behind Missouri S&T's new Manufacture Missouri Ecosystem Building One is to create a dynamic, campus -wide culture of innovation and entrepr eneurialism. This new facility will be a place to forge and explore partnerships between academic research, entrepreneurial start -ups and established companies. Tenants are anticipated to include start -ups, corporate partners and governmental agencies a s well as faculty researchers and research assistants. These R&D activities will yield new businesses and help spur regional economic development, lead to new patents and scientific discovery. Additionally, the types of research spaces envisioned will support Missouri S&T's goal of achieving the more research -intensive Carnegie R1 classification. This project will eliminate $5.3 million in facilities needs and will increase annual operating cost by $504,114. T he $50,000,000 project budget will be funded by gifts. 4. Schrenk Hall Addition and Renovation - Phase III, Missouri S&T The Schrenk Hall Addition and Renovation - Phase III will renovate Schrenk Hall (1938 &1973) to accommodate the Chemistry and Biological Sciences departments. This will be the final phase with the renovation of 17,600 gross square feet (gsf) of the west wing and the replacement of the east wing with a new 90,400 gsf facility and atrium. This project will provide new teaching laboratories, research laboratories, and support space . The project also takes into consideration growth and consolidation of department entities that are spread over multiple buildings on campus. This project is the final phase of an interdisciplinary complex dedicated to providing world -class education and research in biological sciences, chemistry, and chemical and biochemical engineering. Equipped with expanded research space, open- concept research labs and improved accessibility, this facility will leverage Missouri S&T's strengths in computational scie nce, environmental engineering, and materials science and April 22, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1-37 engineering to advance medical, environmental, and biomedical research. The building will also be home to an interdisciplinary Center for Research in Biomaterials, where students and faculty will conduct research in bio- active, bio -inspired, and bio- mimetic materials for a variety of applications. The facility will be an integral component of the student experience at Missouri S&T, since almost every student will take at least one course in one or more important foundational area of biological sciences or chemistry. The existing 1938 Schrenk Hall East should be demolished due to its very poor condition, and the structural system is not conducive to modern building systems. The Facilities Condition Needs Index (FCNI) is 0.57 with over $19 million in facilities needs. Missouri S&T is committed to moving this challenging project forward in a phased approach and investing when possible to address immediate campus needs. Recently, $4 million was added to the Phase 2A budget of the west wing renovation for Biological Sciences Research Labs in addition to the already planned Chemistry Research and Instructional Labs. Another commitment by the campus, construct ed general classrooms, that were planned for this facility, but were built as an addition to the Computer Science Building Student Classroom Learning Center. Since 2016, demand for larger classrooms has increased due to growth. This investment results in more efficient instruction serving more students that will allow them to complete their degrees faster. Both investments have reduced the project budget and overall scope of this project by $9 million. This project will eliminate $19 .1 million in facilities needs and will increase annual operating cost by $187,772. Funding for the $49,562,500 project will be from the State.

McNutt Hall Addition, Missouri S&T The current program calls for the addition of 18,315 gross square feet (gsf) to the north side of McNutt Hall to expand the glassblowing and metalworking laboratories on campus. The addition will also provide public spaces for exhibition, events, offices, and student collaboration rooms and act as a new highly visible public entry plaza on the north end of campus off of Highway 63. The design focuses on the craft and production process of student work by exhibiting the shop space to visitors. The shops may be viewed by visitors from walkways above the shop floor or from the dedicated viewing areas separated from the shops with glass partitions. Students will have an expanded shop area for completing glass projects in a hot, warm, and cold shop. Metalworking students will have forges, tools, and special finishing areas available to them. The inclusion of experiential learning is a unique educational opportunity at Missouri University of Science and Technology. The University has a desire to integrate application with education, and part of the University strategy is to provide experiential learning to all students. Additionally, the University has a broad initiative to connect arts and sciences in unique ways to augment student education. Student interest in applied glass forming and metalworking has increased, and there is significant impetus for shop s pace dedicated and designed specifically for student exploration of these materials. Dedicated glassblowing and metal working shop space will allow programs and experiential learning on campus to expand. It will also offer a tangible way to link material s engineering science to the deeper human history of art and craft. There will be a strong emphasis on exhibition and display of student, faculty, and visiting faculty work. Additionally, exhibits through the project will provide ways to educate visitors regarding the process and the history of each craft as an art and science. The annual operating cost is anticipated at $109,523. The $10,956,750 project budget will be funded by gifts.

UMSL Consolidation Plan , UMSL Renovation of General Services Building (GSB), Social Science Building (SSB) and Patient Care Center (PCC) will include constructing offices, laboratories, classrooms and common core areas to consolidate space for the following programs: Fine Arts, Sculpture and Ceramics, Music, Optometry and Education. The project provides new infrastructure (HVAC, electrical switchgear), classrooms, teaching labs and the associated technology required to teach and learn in today's modern- day world. The project will also include extensive renovation to common use areas to allow students to study and collaborate. This project will address ADA deficiencies with building access that include entryways, elevators and restrooms. Exterior improvements include replacement/upgrade of signage, sidewalks, accessible routes and steps. This project is aligned with UMSL's ten -year Master Plan, Space Survey, and ISES Report by addressing two major findings. First, all studies have identified UMSL having excessive space when compared to the campus demands and there fore causing operating expenses that are not sustainable. Second, the Master Plan has identified UMSL lacking common areas where students can study, learn and collaborate with the peers and causing UMSL to lose enrolment to competitive state schools. Thi s consolidation effort is vital to UMSL's survivability that will reduce UMSL's overall footprint, lower operational expenses and addressing deferred maintenance across seven buildings while adding collaboration space to help retain and attract student enrollment. General Services Building is an underutilized building located on North Campus near the core of UMSL. The S chool of Music, Fine Arts and Sculpture and Ceramics programs are currently operating in separate buildings outside of the core where they are either not designed for their space or have high FCNI numbers. Renovating GSB will allow UMSL to consolidate the School of Music, Fine Arts and Sculpture & Ceramics to the GSB and demolish the Music Building and the Sculpture and Ceramics Building while repurposing the Fine Arts Building. As a result, this consolidation will reduce UMSL's footprint by 60,000 gross s quare feet (gsf), reduce operation expenses by $350,000 annually and reduce the deferred maintenance $9 million . Optometry and the College of Education are primarily operating in two buildings (South Campus Classroom Building and Marillac) where the FCNI index exceeds campus requirements and where these buildings are at the end of life. Renovating underutilized space at the Patient Care Center (South Campus) and SSB Building (North Campus) will allow UMSL to consolidate these two colleges and reduce UMSL' s footprint by an additional 87,000 gsf, reduce operating expenses by $450,000 annually, reduce deferred maintenance by $27 million and demolish the South Campus Classroom Building and Marillac Hall. Funding for the $28,500,000 project will be requested from the State.

Approved by the Board of Curators: Feb 4, 2021 OPEN - ASARED - 1-1 April 22, 2021Executive Summary M.S. in Applied Behavior Analysis (UMSL) UMSL proposes to create a new M.S. in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) degree for five primary reasons: the existing success of the UMSL ABA Certificate Program with potential for greater enrollment, the curriculum's pre-approval by the premier professional organizations in the discipline, evidence of workforce needs, potential for online delivery of the degree, and financial analysis demonstrating fiscal viability and production of new revenue. First, the proposed program will build upon UMSL's current ABA Certificate Program that has experienced seven years of success. Currently, UMSL students wishing to become Board-Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) must complete the M.Ed. in Special Education degree (33 credits) and an additional 18-21 ABA-specific credits to obtain the ABA Certificate, for a total of 51 credit hours. The proposed degree will be 39 credits, which will streamline students' path to a degree and make it an attractive option for students. Second, the proposed program is built to meet new coursework requirements of the profession's credentialing bodies. Students completing UMSL's existing 51-credit- hour option after January 1, 2022 would no longer be eligible to take the BCBA exam. This proposed program has been pre-approved by the Association of Behavior Analysts International (ABAI) as meeting the new requirements. Third, the proposed program addresses important workforce needs. Market analysis reveals an enormous need for BCBAs and Burning Glass analyses estimated that up to 20,000 new jobs will be created in Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas in the next decade. This represents a 23% growth rate. Reports from our partners in the St. Louis Region demonstrates that schools and agencies experience a shortage of qualified practitioners and welcome the creation of the UMSL ABA master's degree. Fourth, stemming from the market capacity and economic growth through employment, the master's program will be offered online (i.e., a combination of synchronous and asynchronous components), thereby crossing local and state borders and having a potential international audience. Importantly, all courses are currently offered online in the certificate program. Fifth, our financial analysis demonstrates an increase in revenue will occur in the first year of the program and more definitively as enrollment increases. No new operating expenses are needed because the ABA Certificate Program is already in place and the curriculum is almost identical to the master's program; therefore, existing resources in place for the ABA Certificate program (e.g., faculty, marketing) will be employed concomitantly in the master's program. Thus, in addition to addressing a market need, the program will increase enrollment and revenue.

OPEN - ASARED - 1-5 April 22, 2021Executive Summary UMSL proposes to create a new M.S. in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) degree for five primary reasons: the existing success of the UMSL ABA Certificate Program with potential for greater enrollment, the curriculum's pre-approval by the premier professional organizations in the discipline, evidence of workforce needs, potential for online delivery of the degree, and financial analysis demonstrating fiscal viability and production of new revenue. First, the proposed program will build upon UMSL's current ABA Certificate Program that has experienced seven years of success. Currently, UMSL students wishing to become Board-Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) must complete the M.Ed. in Special Education degree (33 credits) and an additional 18-21 ABA-specific credits to obtain the ABA Certificate, for a total of 51 credit hours. The proposed degree will be 39 credits, which will streamline students' path to a degree and make it an attractive option for students. Second, the proposed program is built to meet new coursework requirements of the profession's credentialing bodies. Students completing UMSL's existing 51-credit- hour option after January 1, 2022 would no longer be eligible to take the BCBA exam. This proposed program has been pre-approved by the Association of Behavior Analysts International (ABAI) as meeting the new requirements. Third, the proposed program addresses important workforce needs. Market analysis reveals an enormous need for BCBAs and Burning Glass analyses estimated that up to 20,000 new jobs will be created in Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas in the next decade. This represents a 23% growth rate. Reports from our partners in the St. Louis Region demonstrates that schools and agencies experience a shortage of qualified practitioners and welcome the creation of the UMSL ABA master's degree. Fourth, stemming from the market capacity and economic growth through employment, the master's program will be offered online (i.e., a combination of synchronous and asynchronous components), thereby crossing local and state borders and having a potential international audience. Importantly, all courses are currently offered online in the certificate program. Fifth, our financial analysis demonstrates an increase in revenue will occur in the first year of the program and more definitively as enrollment increases. No new operating expenses are needed because the ABA Certificate Program is already in place and the curriculum is almost identical to the master's program; therefore, existing resources in place for the ABA Certificate program (e.g., faculty, marketing) will be employed concomitantly in the master's program. Thus, in addition to addressing a market need, the program will increase enrollment and revenue. OPEN - ASARED - 1-6 April 22, 20211. Introduction Academic components of the program and degree paths. The proposed program is a 39 credit-hour Master of Science Degree in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Applicants enter the program with a bachelor's degree. Its academic components are coursework (23 credits), practicum (10 credits), and a capstone research project (6 credits), and these are sequenced by semester to clarify the pathway to graduation (see section 5.B.). Completing this program allows the graduate to sit for the national licensing examination to obtain the credential as a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA). The degree is designed to be delivered online with a combination of synchronous and asynchronous course components. Graduates move into positions as BCBAs providing direct service to children, adolescents, and adults, many of whom have developmental disorders. Graduates work in a variety of settings, such as schools, community agencies, hospitals, and private practices. The primary focus of their work is the assessment and identification of social and behavioral deficits as well as maladaptive behavior, collection and analysis of data relating to these behaviors, development of intervention plans to ameliorate behavior deficits and challenges, and the implementation and evaluation of the intervention plans. Behavior analysts are professionals whose foundation frameworks is based on the behavior theory. Applied behavior analysts use the scientific knowledge gained from behavior analysis to make changes to socially significant issues by employing evidence-based intervention and making data-based decisions. According to Martin and Carr (2020), there has been a substantial increase of ABA discipline and practitioners worldwide. The number of certified BCBAs have grown exponentially since 1999 when the certification became available. Carr and Nosik (2017) suggested that the growth in the number of BCBAs might be a result of two factors. First, the increase in high-quality applied research and robust results demonstrating the effectiveness of ABA interventions have become well known thus promoting the increase in the demand for services. The second factor related to the number of states in the USA passing legislation which mandated health insurance coverage of ABA interventions for children with ASD. Currently, most health insurances (including Medicaid) will only approve ABA interventions for children with ASD if the service is supervised by a BCBA. With a prevalence of 1 to 54 children with a diagnosis of ASD in the USA (CDC, 2020), the demand for services is larger than the availability of BCBAs. Evolution of the program and reason for proposal. A master's degree is required to obtain the BCBA. In 2011, UMSL became the first of the UM campuses to pioneer a nationally accredited ABA Certificate Program meeting the requirements established by the two major accrediting bodies in the field: Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) and Behavior Analyst Certification Board. We launched the OPEN - ASARED - 1-7 April 22, 2021program to satisfy an extreme local demand for BCBA professionals. Furthermore, few university-accredited-BCBA programs in the State of Missouri existed at that time. The original (and current) design of our program was to use our Master of Education Degree in Special Education, with a Concentration in Autism and Developmental Disabilities, as the basis for our students to meet initial requirements to achieve their BCBA license. Our current master's degree program requires 33 credit hours (See Appendix A for full curriculum). However, this degree alone does not include the required coursework necessary for the BCBA license eligibility. Six additional courses (18 credit hours), earning students a university graduate certificate in Applied Behavior Analysis, must be taken over and above the required 33 credit hours for the master's degree. With the current changes required to meet examination qualifications, 10 out of the 11 courses students need to take in the MEd in Special Education degree are ultimately not relevant towards BCBA candidacy qualification. The required BCBA courses added to the master's degree are displayed in Appendix B. Consequently, along with earning their M.Ed. degree, our students take an additional six courses, totaling 51 (33 + 18) credit hours, to meet the national BCBA licensure eligibility requirements. As a result, our students must complete a total of 51 credit hours to complete the master's degree and certificate in ABA that leads to BCBA licensure eligibility. The additional coursework beyond the master's degree creates a circuitous degree route to obtain the BCBA certification. We describe this path to the BCBA as a \"Master's Degree Plus\" Program. Courses for the certificate in ABA are taught by UMSL faculty and regional, expert behavior analysts who work in highly respected centers for autism treatment and research, including specialized behavior treatment facilities in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area. The Master's Degree Plus Program has been successful since its inception in 2011, when it was approved by the Missouri Department of Higher Education and achieved approval from the national Behavior Analysis Certification Board. To date, 65 graduate students have completed the master's degree plus, and all graduates met the requirements to sit for the national BCBA licensure examination. Over the past 4 years, enrollment has steadily increased with an average of 9 students per cohort. Appendix C displays enrollment trends since 2017. Beginning in 2022, graduates of ABA master's programs must meet new course and supervised experience requirements in order to sit for the licensing examination for the BCBA, the requirements of which are displayed in Appendices D and E, respectively. Our proposed degree in ABA meets the new requirements for the BCBA which we expect will lead to greater student demand than similar types of programs in the past. Furthermore, the courses and sequence have been preapproved by ABAI (Appendix F). OPEN - ASARED - 1-8 April 22, 2021National examination results. There are nine public and private institutions in the State of Missouri with approved course sequences allowing graduates to sit for the national BCBA exam. Those located in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area are UMSL, Lindenwood University, Saint Louis University (SLU), and Webster University. Only three of the nine programs in the state have graduated enough students to qualify for publicly available pass rates on the BCBA examination. According to the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (2013-2018), those institutions and their average 5-year pass rates are: UMSL (78.50%), Lindenwood (47.00%), and SLU (79.00%). The national average pass rate is 64.20%, and the state average pass rate is higher at 74.28%. The higher pass rate for the state is attributed to the performance of graduates from UMSL and SLU. The remaining six institutions are new programs or have too few candidates to qualify for reporting of scores. Conclusions on the current degree. The advantages of the current Master's Degree Plus are that (a) students earn a master's degree, which is a foundational requirement for the BCBA, (b) students are qualified to sit for the national certification examination on which a passing score results in the awarding of the BCBA, and (c) program graduates have positive pass rates. However, the significant disadvantage of the Master's Degree Plus Program is that it requires an onerous, 51-credit-hour path to the BCBA licensure eligibility. UMSL faculty who recruit prospective students have reported that the lengthy degree plan and high number of required courses are an impediment to recruiting students. Prospective applicants know that they can complete a master's degree Plus Program in Applied Behavior Analysis faster and for fewer credit hours at other St. Louis metropolitan region institutions (Lindenwood, 42 hours; SLU, 39 hours). Thus, the current UMSL Master's Plus Program is less expedient and more costly when compared to other university pathways to earning the BCBA certification in the region. In summary, despite the merits of the Master's Degree Plus Program, the high number of credit hours makes the degree unattractive to students due to its length of coursework, additional tuition, and the costs of books/fees. Moreover, all the benefits associated with the master's degree Plus model would be shared by the new model, except that students will earn a M.S. degree in Applied Behavior Analysis rather than an MEd in Special Education. The solution to the excessive number of credit hours required in the current program is to separate it from the Master's in Special Education, which will continue to enroll and graduate students, and establish a Master of Science Degree in ABA. Because the master's Plus Program will no longer meet requirements for qualifying students for taking the BCBA exam after 2022, the proposed program will continue to provide accreditation requirements of the ABAI and the Behavior Analysis Certification Board, thus qualifying graduates to sit for the BCBA examination. Establishing a stand-alone master's degree would also make UMSL program similar to BCBA programs of other universities across the nation. Moreover, the proposed degree will be delivered online with synchronous and asynchronous components. OPEN - ASARED - 1-9 April 22, 2021Need for offering the degree. To work as a BCBA, one must possess a master's degree, have appropriate coursework in ABA, accrue the required number of hours of supervised fieldwork, and pass the national examination. As noted in the preceding section, UMSL has created a pathway for students to achieve this goal; however, in using an existing special education degree, the pathway is onerous and circuitous. Faculty advisors also report that prospective students choose other programs because of the prohibitive number of credits required. By establishing a degree in ABA (not special education), UMSL will provide a direct route to a degree, accredited coursework, and the licensure examination, while increasing enrollment. As a point of information, we plan to retain the current University certificate in ABA for students who matriculate at UMSL with a master's degree in a related field but, with the addition of the certificate courses, would qualify for the licensure examination. This plan targets two groups\u2014those who need a master's degree and those who need the ABA coursework. However, our recruitment analysis shows the vast majority of prospective applicants do not hold a master's degree. As such, we expect 70% of new students to be enrolled in the M.S. program and 30% to be enrolled in the Certificate program. Whereas the master's degree plus program typically admitted an average of nine students, we project this number to double in size. Persons responsible for the success of the program. The proposed degree will be housed in the Department of Educator Preparation and Leadership in the College of Education. This is the department home for UMSL ABA Certificate. Dr. Andresa De Souza, BCBA-D, whose faculty appointment is in this department, is the current Program Director and will continue in this role upon the creation of the degree. No additional faculty hires are anticipated in the next three years. We propose to hire an Assistant Professor in Year 5 of the program contingent on program growth and vitality. We discuss this in greater detail in Section 3 on finances. 2. University Mission and Program Analysis 2.A. Alignment with Mission and Goals Alignment with UMSL's Strategic Plan. Our proposed program fundamentally aligns with UMSL's mission: \"We transform lives.\" Not exclusively related to the lives of graduate students with whom we work in the university setting and/or its virtual environment, we impact the lives of families impacted through the positive initiatives that inform our Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and beyond. In agreement with UMSL's vision, as \"a force for good, and a leader in the pursuit of excellence in education, impactful research, and community service,\" our proposed program is dedicated to supporting our university's pledge to offer \"education for everyone who is willing and able to seek it out.\" Honoring \"our land-grant beginnings,\" the proposed program, in tandem with UMSL's fundamental academic philosophies, \"positions (us) as partners in the search for knowledge, progress, and positive change for ourselves, our communities, OPEN - ASARED - 1-10 April 22, 2021our world.\" This proposal also supports a number of specific goals outlined in the 2018- 2023 UMSL Strategic Plan, including: Goal 1: Increase the number of educated citizens in the St. Louis region. The proposed program meets UMSL's fundamental purpose to educate and graduate diverse populations of students in their search for different and better lives. Per this goal, our proposed program offers qualified students access to our already-proven, high-quality ABA certificate program that \"prepares them for success in the classroom and beyond as they become leaders of our economy and communities.\" As noted above, enrollment trends from 2017-2020 (see Appendix C) are stable, and 9-11 students graduate with the ABA certificate. As discussed later, the proposed masters will double that enrollment and graduate 18-22 students annually by Year 7. Goal 2: Enhance academic quality and learning experiences. The proposed program's enhanced academic quality and learning experiences, which are contemporary, are based upon behavioral science and ABA, and are considered best practice. Its cohort-based, year-round schedule will \"create an environment for enrollment growth.\" Also, per the UMSL's Strategic Plan to \"expand and enhance student employment and internships,\" our five-semester practicum sequence allows students to have 25-contact-hour/week internships Typically, students complete their fieldwork in schools or clinics where they are compensated for their work by the practicum site. The preapproval of courses by ABAI adds yet another layer of quality assurance to the program. Goal 6: Integrate community engagement as a critical component of a university education and collegiate experience. This strategic goal has been a major initiative of the Special Education Program, especially supporting disability education and outreach. The proposed program carries forward the fulfillment of this goal, as it endeavors to \"recognize and celebrate community engagement at all levels.\" It advances UMSL's compact goal to \"integrate community engagement as a critical component of university education and collegiate experience.\" In a later section of this proposal, we discuss five letters from leaders of school districts, agencies, and businesses who welcome our continuing partnership. Furthermore, we identify several existing relationships with schools and agencies that will continue to welcome our students and graduates. Alignment with College of Education Mission. The mission of the College of Education is: \"We advance educational knowledge and practice. We partner with communities. We promote diversity, equity, and excellence.\" In addition to congruence with the UMSL strategic plan, the goals of the M.S. in ABA program described in the above align with UMSL's College of Education's mission. Specifically, the UMSL M.S. Program will generate research and disseminate it to the field of ABA, and Dr. Andresa De Souza, Program Director, has 11 publications and 13 conference or invited presentations in the past three years. As discussed below, we already have an existing network of ABA partners throughout the St. Louis Region in schools, agencies, and businesses. Moreover, because so many BCBAs work with individuals with developmental disabilities, the ABA program clearly promotes diversity and equity among our students and the people with whom they work. OPEN - ASARED - 1-11 April 22, 2021The Program as a Campus and College Priority. The faculty associated with the ABA program foresaw the changes in accreditation and licensure standards almost two years ago. Consequently, they began planning to create the Master's in ABA by engaging their department faculty and the dean College of Education in the Spring 2019 semester. When it was apparent there was department and college support for a standalone master's degree, the dean engaged Academic Affairs, and discussions with the provost were subsequently supportive of this proposal. Over the past 18 months, drafts of the preproposal were shared with first the Dean's Office and eventually with Academic Affairs. This proposal has the support of the College of Education and Academic Affairs. 2.B. Duplication and Collaboration Within Campus and Across System Within the University of Missouri System, the University of Missouri in Columbia is the only institution with a master's degree in ABA program. Over the past 18 months, Dr. Ann Taylor, Dean, UMSL College of Education, initiated discussions with Dr. Kathryn Chval, now former Dean, MU College of Education, about a possible collaboration between UMSL and MU. Dean Chval requested that we consult her faculty. Dr. De Souza and Associate Dean Michael Bahr, both UMSL faculty members, spoke with current Interim Dean, Dr. Erica Lembke, then Chair of the Department of Special Education, at MU. The UMSL faculty shared program information regarding the proposed degree, curriculum and course sequence, and related information. Dr. De Souza, Dr. Lembke, and the MU ABA faculty met and discussed course-sharing between our programs, especially since the UMSL program will be delivered online. With approval of the M.S. in ABA program, we plan to explore with Mizzou faculty the opportunities for course sharing. (Note: Dr. Lembke from MU has provided a letter of support, a copy of which is included in Appendix G with all letters of support discussed later). While these discussions continue, it is important to note similarities and differences between the MU and UMSL programs. Both the MU program and the proposed UMSL program are 39 credit-hours. Whereas the UMSL program will be delivered online, the MU program is campus-based. Because of online delivery, UMSL attracts a specific student population, who would otherwise not be able to attend the program because of their geographical location. In addition, most of our students hold full-time employment and have families. In summary, the two programs are sufficiently different in structure and both have the potential to coexist without any significant concerns about cross-campus competition. The opportunity to complete a program from their place of residence while maintaining full-time employment makes the UMSL Master's program desirable for a specific group of students who are not able to relocate or attend as master's program as a full-time student. In contrast, students attending the master's program at MU must attend classes on- campus and are required to complete their first year of practica at the MU Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Only in their second year are students allowed to procure paid employment outside of the Thompson Center. Thus, OPEN - ASARED - 1-12 April 22, 2021proximity to Columbia is essential in order to complete the required program practica. Because of this, the characteristics of the two programs are different and attract a separate type of applicant. For example, the practica for the proposed UMSL program will be at a site of the student's selection while the student holds a paid position. Primary practicum sites for our students have typically included the sizable cache of children with disabilities in the St. Louis Region in schools such as Special School District (approximately 22,000+ total) and other schools and agencies (discussed in Section 5.B). 3. Business-Related Criteria and Justification 3.A. Market Analysis 3.A.1. Rationale and Workforce Demand for the Program BCBAs work in a wide range of organizations, including early childhood education settings, clinics, residential treatment centers, schools, and in-service organizations. Therapies and interventions based in the principles of behavior analysis (a.k.a., ABA therapy) are recognized and endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General, and nationally leading, humankind research and practice organizations: the American Academy of Pediatrics (Evidence Review of Interventions for Autism, 2011), National Institute of Mental Health (Autism Spectrum Disorder, 2018), and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder, 2019). ABA, considered the \"gold standard\" of behavioral intervention, is a discipline relying upon research-driven, evidenced-based principles that significantly enhance the quality of life of individuals with specific habilitative, behavioral, and educational needs. Research shows that in addition autism, individuals with related disorders (e.g., intellectual impairments) also benefit from ABA interventions (Axelrod, McElrath, & Dozier, Iwata, & Hafen, 2010). ABA interventions positively impact behaviors such as aggression, self- injurious behavior, and elopement (Matson & Nebel-Schwalm, 2007). ABA interventions can build vital, useful skills, such as language and communication skills (De Souza, Fisher, & Rodriguez, 2019; Kurtz, Boelterc, Jarmolowicz, Chin, & Hagopian, 2011), academic skills (Belfiore, Lee, Vargas, Skinner, 2013; Eckert, Ardoin, Daly III, & Martens, 2013), social skills (Chandler, Lubeck, & Fowler, 1992), and daily living skills (Cannella-Malone et al., 2006) among learners of all ages. The principles of ABA are proven effective in both structured situations, such as classrooms, as well as in unstructured, more natural, everyday situations, such as social opportunities, play, general home-life interactions, and the workplace to improve the individuals' abilities to listen, read, converse, attend, and engage positively with and gain empathy for others (Granpeesheh, Tarbox, & Dixon, 2009). The overall goal of ABA is to promote change to (a) social relevant issues, (b) personal independence, and to (c) OPEN - ASARED - 1-13 April 22, 2021enhance the quality of life of those involved. From a prevention perspective, research has shown that ABA interventions can significantly improve behavior and abilities and decrease the demand for special services (Flynn & Healy, 2012; Roane, Fisher, & Carr, 2016). With the high incidence of ASD diagnosis - 1 in every 54 children (Center of Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) - there is a high demand for BCBAs in response to insurance and service regulations across the treatment for children with ASD. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (2020) reported that there was a 2,000% increase in the annual demand in the USA for professionals holding a BCBA certification from 2000 to 2020. Anecdotal reports show an increase in awareness and requests for ABA treatment for children with autism and other developmental disabilities in contrast with the reality of the shortage of trained BCBAs. Currently, there are 5 university-based master programs approved to prepare BCBAs in Missouri. Under this scenario, prospective student from outside of the range of these universities, must relocate for training. One solution to overcome issues related to the geographical barrier is the creation of online programs. Because our proposed, M.S. in ABA program will provide students with all the requirements to sit for the BCBA exam and will be delivered online, we present ourselves as a strong competitor and program option for local, state, and national students seeking the BCBA certification. Lastly, and from a service perspective, local BCBA agencies in St. Louis cite a 2-year \"waiting list\" of children who need BCBA services. To address this need, we will enroll students who desire expertise in the science of ABA, and in earning their BCBA certificate and State licensure to practice ABA therapies in local classrooms, agencies, and beyond. Potential Impact: Benefits to UMSL Students and UMSL Community. We consistently hear from prospective UMSL applicants that it would benefit them to enter a master's degree program in ABA earning the BCBA credential requirements in tandem with their employment in Greater St. Louis schools or agencies. Having a master's degree in ABA provides a more compact and time-efficient program of study. This is very attractive to students who desire an advanced degree seamlessly incorporating preparation for the national certification examination, while they continue working in their current jobs. Furthermore, the online delivery of the program combined with synchronous and asynchronous formats will allows students to secure full-time employment while maintaining a balance between their studies and personal life as the time spent commuting to and from the campus is eliminated. Demand Based upon Analytics. Demand continues to surge for BCBA practitioners who are certified to provide ABA interventions proven to produce meaningful, behavioral changes in children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as well as those with the autism diagnosis. A mid-year 2020 report from OPEN - ASARED - 1-14 April 22, 2021the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finding the 1 in 54 U.S. children have autism indicates a prevalence rate of 1.8585%--up from 1 in every 5959 children (1.77%) in their 2018 report. Similarly, a news release from Washington University's School of Medicine , distributed April 2018, provides new data indicating that increasing rates of children diagnosed with autism persist, and that children typically benefit from years of individualized ABA interventions provided by licensed BCBAs. Clearly, more BCBAs are needed. Additionally, as an alert from families needing ABA services for children with autism, the CDC's Community Report on Autism 2018, A Snapshot of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Missouri, stresses the critical need for BCBAs in our state. Howard Smith, the Director of the Greater St. Louis Region-St. Louis City/St. Charles County First Steps program, noted an increase in early childhood care referrals, and the continuing need for services targeting young children and their families in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area. Furthermore, a recent report by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (2020) indicated that there were 233 job postings for BCBAs in Missouri in 2019, thereby creating a vibrant potential job market for our graduates. As of February 21, 2021, there are 33 ABA positions advertised in Missouri for this month alone. The positions range from behavior technicians to clinical directors of treatment centers. This rate of job opportunities is consistent with monthly trends over the past three years. Social Work Licensure (Behavior Analyst, n.d.) reports that because of extreme need, now is an excellent time to pursue a BCBA certification. It projects a job growth rate of 14% in the next decade, a rate significantly faster than U.S. economic growth projections (per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and faster than the average for all professions. According to Social Work Licensure, BCBAs are critically needed to improve understandings of mental health and behavioral patterns. Similarly, Burning Glass Technologies, a software company that collects and analyzes U.S. labor market data, includes online job postings collected from over 50,000 sources. Their database, used to assess the national employment demand for behavior analysts from 2010 to 2018, asserts that the demand for behavior analysts is ever-increasing. Annual demand for individuals holding BCBA/BCBA-D certification \"increased approximately 1,942% from 2010 to 2018, with increases seen in almost every State\" (Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2018). A detailed Burning Glass Market Analysis (see Appendix H) for this proposal revealed an average relative growth (10.04%) of related job postings over the next 8 years in the States of Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas and high growth rate (16.04%) nationwide. This will result in the creation of 11,385 new jobs. As noted above, over 200 ABA jobs were available last year in Missouri with over 30 openings currently available in February 2021. Overall, graduates of ABA/BCBA programs commonly transition into seven different occupation groups such as social work (47.6%), mental health OPEN - ASARED - 1-15 April 22, 2021therapy (22.1%), and mental and behavioral counseling (15.3%). The Burning Glass Market Analysis showed the majority of jobs posting in applied behavior analysis requires a master's degree (50.9%) and 0 to 2 years of experience (69.4%). Finally, 83% of job postings are in Health Care and Social Assistance, and Educational Services industry. A great need for BCBAs continues and the role of the university in forming competent and ethical professionals is paramount. We received significant backing from the UMSL College of Education and community partners, including schools and agencies. Letters of support (see Appendix G) stress the high demand for professionals with a BCBA credential in the St. Louis region. These letters endorse the need for high-quality programs to prepare new BCBAs who will play a crucial role in agencies serving children and adults with disabilities in the St. Louis area and beyond. Appendix G also contains letters of support from the UMSL Chancellor and Provost. As Donald McCary, Executive Director of Planning and Development, Special School District of St. Louis County, noted in his letter of support: \"Difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled BCBAs has become one of the primary constraining factors to school districts seeking an effective means of addressing increasingly complex behavioral concerns and to the growth of businesses seeking to provide effective treatments to children and adults with disabilities.\" Mark Keeley, President/CEO of the St. Louis Arc, noted: \"We currently employ several BCBA's and we anticipate hiring many more in the coming years. We have a waitlist for our services at the present time because we cannot get enough qualified staff. Your proposed master's degree in Applied Behavior Analysis will ensure a steady stream of highly educated professionals to help meet not only our needs but the needs throughout St. Louis and the rest of the US.\" Vince Hillyer, President and CEO of Great Circle, an agency serving individuals with autism, wrote: \"[The increase in autism] has resulted in a statewide and nationwide shortage of Board-Certified Behavior Analysts...available to meet the needs of this growing population. Because ABA-based therapies have proven very effective for children with autism and other related disorders, Great Circle recognizes the importance of having highly qualified BCBAs to provide this effective treatment....A program such as the UMSL ABA program can play an integral role in Great Circle's efforts to address important community needs.\" OPEN - ASARED - 1-16 April 22, 2021Dr. Ann Taylor, Dean of the UMSL College of Education, observed: \"The proposed MS Degree streamlines our existing [ABA] Program for the benefit of students and employers. Currently...students take a circuitous route--through an MEd in Special Education followed by additional course work in behavior analysis--to complete the degree and satisfy the requirements to sit for the national licensing examination as a BCBA. The proposed 39-credit-hour degree eliminates this problem, with the added benefit that graduates earn a degree in behavior analysis rather than a certificate. The proposed route matches degree plans from UMSL competitors across the country and should result in increased enrollment...The college is pleased, once again, to be able to respond to the workforce needs of our state and region through providing a quality offering for educators in our region.\" 3.A.2. Student Demand for the Program The enrollment model for this program is predicated on several assumptions and guide enrollment projections represented in the following Student Enrollment Projection tables. The assumptions were developed based on (a) current practices in the Master's Plus Program (e.g., students take 2-3 courses per semester and continue to work full- or part-time in a setting delivering ABA services), (b) current enrollment in the certificate program plus an expectation that enrollment will increase given our market analysis, (c) a high retention rate in the certificate program (i.e., 90% or higher after one year, 100% thereafter), and current enrollment indicating most students (i.e., 90% or more) are residents of Missouri. Our assumptions include the cannibalization of 7 students annually who would have otherwise pursued the M.Ed. in Special Education. The program requires full-time student enrollment. Students matriculate in the fall semester and graduate in at the end of the summer session two years later. Students take 2-3 courses per semester, one of which is a practicum in most cases. The practicum may be completed at a student's place of employment. As a result, a student's attendance in the program technically cuts across three fiscal years. The assumptions are: In Years 1 and 2 of the program, we project 15 students will be admitted, followed by 18 in Years 3 and 4. In Year 5, the program maximum of 22 new students per cohort each year is achieved, and enrollment stabilizes thereafter. Annual admission projections above include 7 students transferring from existing master's Plus certification program. (Note: From 2018-2020, the M.Ed. in Special Education has a median of 68 students enrolled in fall and spring classes. This program will lose 7 students per year, although the increase in total ABA students in the master's will more than offset these OPEN - ASARED - 1-17 April 22, 2021losses. Tab 2, SCH Cannibalization Projections, in the Pro Forma provides data on this issue.) Student retention between the first and second years in the program is 90% and 100% from the second year to graduation. Maximum total program enrollment of 62 students is reached in year 7. This maximum is projected to consist of 44 students new to campus and 18 students transferred from other campus programs. Program capacity is reached when 22 students are admitted per year. Given the strong market analysis and the significant local support for the program, we expect an initial enrollment projection of 15 students, minimally, in the first and second years of the program. By year 5, we expect 22 students per year. These projections are represented in Table 1a \u2014see below. The following is a supplementary table that show enrollment by fiscal year. Table 1a\u2014 Student Enrollment TOTAL Head Count Projections by fiscal year (anticipated total number of students in program) PROGRAM: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 FY27 48 54 58 62 Notes: This table includes all students enrolled including those 7 students transferring from other existing programs. Program capacity for all cohorts is reached in Year 7 with an anticipated total enrollment of 62 students. The students will comprise a combination of those primarily seeking the M.S. Degree in ABA and those who possess a master's degree and are interested in the ABA Certificate only. The latter group (certificate only) is projected to be small in number and may elect to complete two additional courses and obtain a second master's degree. Effective January 1, 2022, the Behavior Analyst Certification Board will approve candidates for the BCBA examination with a master's degree in any area of study along with appropriate course requirements and 2000 hours of supervised experience. Thus, there is the potential to attract students who already possess a master's degree but still need to complete the required coursework and practicum experience in order to qualify for taking the BCBA examination. These students will receive the Certificate in ABA, although they could obtain the MS. Degree by adding two courses. The next two tables display the number of students new to campus each year (Table 1b) and the projected number of degrees awarded (Table 1c). OPEN - ASARED - 1-18 April 22, 2021Table 1b.

Financial Projections Our proposal was reviewed by the UMSL fiscal officer, Tina Hyken. 3.B.1 Additional Resources Needed One Time/New Resources Faculty dedicated to the existing certificate program will be reassigned to the proposed new master's program; therefore, there are no immediate one-time or start-up expenses. Recurring - Faculty In Year 2, we plan to offer a graduate research/teaching assistantship to one student in each cohort. The tuition waiver and stipends are funded by tuition revenue generated through the new students admitted to the program. Projections include a 2% annual cost increase for both the tuition waiver and the students' stipends. In Year 5, we propose to add a new faculty member due to (a) program growth and increased enrollment, (b) the special requirements (i.e., certifications, licensure) required to teach in the program, and (c) a procedural safeguard to avoid the program being person dependent. The additional faculty member will be added contingent upon the sustained market demand and the program continuing to meet enrollment targets. Financial projections include modest moving costs as a benefit in year 5 and full-time benefits in years 5 and forward. Projections include a 2% annual cost OPEN - ASARED - 1-19 April 22, 2021increase for salary and benefits at the current UMSL full-time rates. Should the program have fewer than the target of 54 students, the COE would delay or cancel the new hire. As total student headcount increases immediately, adjunct instructor costs increase immediately in Year 1 scaling up until Year 4 and then leveling off as the new faculty member is hired and enrollment stabilizes. The St. Louis metropolitan region has adequate expertise to fulfil these modest needs for adjuncts. Projections include a 2% annual cost increase for salary and benefits at the current UMSL part-time rates. Recurring - Other Immediately, there are two recurring operating costs. First, the ABAI certification requires an annual professional membership, national and state certification, and program yearly approval estimated at $2,740. Second, we estimate on-going targeted recruiting costs at $5,000. Projections include 1% annual cost increase for these items. In Year 5, there are two additional recurring operating costs associated with the new faculty hire. Annual recurring computing expenses and materials/supplies have been estimated at $1,500 and $3,000 respectively with 1% annual cost increases. Recurring - Campus Overhead Allocation Finally, the pro forma recognizes that every academic program has an obligation to contribute towards the organization's costs of operations. UMSL has no formal process allocating overhead to academic units. As a proxy, information provided by UM System Controller's Office estimates this overhead cost at $83.06 per student credit hour. Overhead costs included in the Proforma are projected based on the total student credit hours generated including those generated by transferred students. 3.B.2. Revenue As evident in the revenue analysis vis-\u00e0-vis program expenses, the source of revenue is student tuition and fees. The previous enrollment projections provide a basis for our revenue analysis. Additional assumptions included in the revenue projections are: 1) Tuition and Education supplemental fee increases by 2% annually; 2) Similar to other master's program in the College, students are 90% resident and 10% non- resident; 3) UMSL On-line supplemental fee is excluded; 4) Tuition and fee revenue from seven students transferred from other programs is excluded; and 5) Tuition scholarships for the two graduate research/teaching assistants discussed above are treated as a reduction in total tuition revenue. This treatment is consistent with generally accepted accounting procedures. OPEN - ASARED - 1-20 April 22, 2021UMSL operates a centralized budget system in which all tuition generated by the College of Education and 20% of the College of Education Supplemental Fee are received by general operating accounts at the campus level. Upon approval of this new degree, UMSL will determine what portion of new tuition revenues would be converted to additional general revenue allocations to the College of Education (for expenses based on Proforma) and Graduate School (for graduate assistant scholarships). As a courtesy, we have placed one table from the Pro Forma in Appendix I showing enrollment, revenue, and expenses. 3.B.3. Net Revenue Program net revenue is displayed Table 2 below. The revenue generated by tuition is juxtaposed to expenses, and noteworthy, the program will be profitable in its first year and beyond. Even with the addition of a new faculty member in Year 5 (FY26), the program remains profitable. By Year 7 (FY28), revenue becomes stable when enrollment capacity (i.e., 22 new students each year) is achieved. OPEN - ASARED - 1-21 April 22, 2021Table 2.

Financial and Academic Viability To assure both academic and academic viability, the following table displays enrollment projections by the end of Year 7. Table 3 Enrollment at the End of Year 7 for the Program to Be Financially and Academically Viable. Viability Minimum Enrollment Academic 30 Financial 54 Overall 54 Our annual admissions projections for the first two years of the program (n = 15) are conservative. Thereafter, we predict enrollments of 18 new students per year with a maximum of 22 in Year 5 and afterward. Maximum student enrollment is reached in Year 7. To maintain cohort viability and justification for instructional resource allocation, academic viability requires a minimum of 30 students by fiscal Year 4. Financial Viability is determined based on a sensitivity analysis of the enrollment which is the primary driver of the revenues. As noted above, financial viability is predicated on a minimum of 18 students per cohort each year (total of 54 in the program) by Fiscal Year 4 and thereafter. Various expense and revenue scenarios are represented in the Sensitivity Results. At the base level assumptions, the net margin to campus is positive, though modest, at Year 1 after campus overhead allocations. With the exception of the new faculty member proposed for Year 5, program expenses are relatively small. Should enrollment fall below the necessary levels, the proposed addition of a full-time faculty member would be reassessed. The Enrollment Sensitivity Analysis found in Appendix J (and in the Pro Forma) displays financial results for Year 7 (when maximum total program enrollment stabilizes) at variances ranging from negative 25 percent to positive 20% of the predicted 22 students admitted. Actual results can be as much as negative 21% below projection before proposed program margin AFTER application of campus overhead results in a negative net result. 3.C. Business Plan: Marketing, Student Success, Transition & Exit Strategy 3.C.1. Marketing Plan UMSL's online M.S. in ABA degree will maintain a strong presence on its College of Education website. An asset in marketing the program is the precedent of students completing either the master's plus and/or the certificate program. Recruitment, therefore, is ongoing and makes marketing easier. That notwithstanding, there will OPEN - ASARED - 1-23 April 22, 2021be available brochures describing the program's features, highlighting the program's pathway to potential student career goals. Information meetings about the program will be held once each semester, with non-UMSL guest speakers who will emphasize the importance of growing the BCBA numbers to meet the critical demand regionally and nationally. The new program can also be marketed as part of UMSL and UM System initiatives to offer online programming. Many of the BCBA courses can also be applied towards UMSL doctoral studies and research-based programs. Additionally, the COE recruiter will support these marketing efforts to regional school districts. The ABA degree is a moderately-sized, graduate-intensive program, which reflects a tightly connected network of organizations hiring BCBAs to work with students and adults with developmental disabilities. Our local market analysis has demonstrated a strong need from schools and agencies, including small businesses serving people with developmental disabilities. Program faculty continue to receive a steady stream of requests from area businesses and prospective applicants. Consequently, recruitment is and will continue to occur through the local contacts faculty have with schools, agencies, and businesses turning to UMSL for prospective graduates. 3.C.2. Student Success Plan The students in the proposed program will attend full-time, and most will be tuition- paying. The COE organizational structure is designed specifically for student success, and this begins with a prospective applicant's contact with a graduate advisor in the Office of Advising and Student Services. These advisors specialize in work with the ABA program and students. The advisors partner closely with program faculty through all stages of the graduate student experience\u2014recruitment, assignment of a faculty advisor, retention through student supports (e.g., financial aid, writing center, Graduate School policies) and the graduation application and audit of the program of study. The expertise of the advising unit complements the close practicum supervision by faculty required in the ABA program. 3.C.3. Transition Plan This is an important, already stable program that has a solid record of successfully transitioning through the loss and hire of faculty with expertise in ABA. The latest loss of an ABA faculty member (through retirement in 2019) had little effect on the program because members of the special education faculty have knowledge and expertise in ABA and can assist with program needs when they arise. Consequently, we are confident of program sustainment, even through faculty changes. Should the program director choose to leave, a national search would commence immediately. This would be done to assure a qualified and credentialed BCBA would director the program. OPEN - ASARED - 1-24 April 22, 20213.C.4. Exit Strategy The COE actively monitors all programs to ensure maximum efficiency, and we address program viability through continuous program improvement. The COE dedicates a position\u2014 a director or associate dean\u2014to quality assurance. This work is coordinated through the work of the COE Curriculum and Program Quality Committee. Plus, the shared nature of some ABA courses with special education potentially minimizes program cost. Faculty in ABA program are well qualified to teach in the special education program. Therefore, if the program suffered an unanticipated sustained enrollment drop, such as 15 or fewer students total in the program, as a result in changes in market demand, we would examine the viability of the program and close it, transferring faculty resources to another high demand special education area. 4. Institutional Capacity Drs. Ann Taylor, Dean of the UMSL College of Education, Marie Mora, Provost & Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and Kristin Sobolik, UMSL Chancellor, are supportive of establishing the proposed degree, and they recognize the potential for a more direct route for the preparation of students desiring the BCBA. There is potential for significantly increasing the enrollment, from the current 11 students in the program in 2020-2021 to 22 students per cohort by the program's fifth year. Again, please see their letters explaining the rationale and justification for institutional support of this degree (see Appendix G). Our proposed program will be based in the Department of Educator Preparation and Leadership within the College of Education. This department currently offers the Master of Education Degree in Special Education and the University Certificate in Applied Behavior Analysis. The proposed program's faculty leaders, Dr. De Souza and others, are also based in this department. The department supports the proposed program. Moreover, the College pledges to continue offering exemplary instructional delivery, practicum supervision, and superb, in-house academic advisement and support. Furthermore, the Dean of the College of Education and the Chair of the Department of Special Education from Mizzou, former Dean Katherine Chval and Interim Dean Erika Lembke, respectively, have expressed their support for the creation of a M.S. in ABA program and welcome future planning and collaboration. Regarding ability to develop, implement, and teach online courses, Dr. De Souza is already teaching online courses offered in the program as are other faculty members, including our adjuncts. She is currently a Fellow of the ACUE Program, a comprehensive and independently validated statement of teaching competencies that prepares faculty, through a year-long program, to implement proven evidence-based instructional practices to improve student achievement and close equity gaps. With OPEN - ASARED - 1-25 April 22, 2021the support of the UMSL Center for Teaching and Learning, current instructors (a) have already participated in professional development for online instruction and/or (b) have or will receive certification for competence online instruction. Finally, it is important to note that the courses in the proposed degree are already being offered online, and quality control practices are currently in place institutionally. 5. Program Characteristics 5.A. Program Outcomes After completing the M.S. in ABA Program, students will have practitioner-level knowledge of foundations and application of ABA (see Appendix K for the Curriculum Map for the M.S. in ABA Program). As a point of information, all COE programs are currently working with the UMSL Center for Teaching and Learning on the Curriculum Alignment Process (or CAP). In addition to developing ABA program outcomes (next paragraph), the curriculum map displays the relationship between program outcomes and courses, including the level of introduction, development, and mastery for each program outcome. Specifically, our program outcomes are: Discuss the philosophical underpinning of behavior analysis; Identify and explain the concepts and principles of applied behavior analysis; Implement measurement of behavior and properly display and interpreted data; Describe the different types of experimental designs use in applied behavior analysis research; Conduct behavior assessments and implement behavior-change procedures; Select and implement individualized intervention procedures; Explain the main aspects of supervision and staff management; Demonstrate professional behavior in accordance with the Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts. 5.B. Program Design and Content The proposed degree has three distinct features: This is a 39-credit hour, standalone degree in applied behavior analysis. The degree will be offered online with asynchronous and synchronous components. It retains meeting the standards approved by the ABAI, whereby the Behavior Analysis Certification Board approves the course sequence that will allow graduated students to gain approval from the BACB to sit for the national certification examination. OPEN - ASARED - 1-26 April 22, 2021The proposed program will require five practicum courses, starting in the second semester, each of which require 400-clock hours of clinical experience. In our current program, the majority of our students are employed in schools or clinics where they deliver intervention services to children and adults. Student s must secure access to a practicum site and field supervision by a BCBA during their first semester of studies. The inclusion of two capstone courses in the second year of the program enables students to engage in research-based, applied projects focused on the children and adults with whom they work. In addition to enhancing clinical skills, the program will require and promote applied research. If an individual would like to pursue doctoral study after completing the master's degree, the curriculum allows a student to substitute six credits of thesis research in place of the capstone courses. In terms of prospective enrollment, admission will be conducted annually to create a cohort-based program with full-time students. We project the number of admitted students to increase to 15-20 students per academic year. Projected increased enrollment is due to our market analysis on the local and national need for BCBAs. Additionally, delivery via online instruction will promote greater flexibility for students. Revision to national standards. As noted earlier, existing programs and coursework must be updated to meet new BCBA credentialing standards by January 2022. Appendix D displays the changes fundamental to crafting the program's coursework meeting the revised guidelines by this date. In addition to a denser course load, the Behavior Analysis Certification Board has increased the required supervised fieldwork hours BCBA candidates must complete before sitting for the exam (see Appendix E). To meet the new certification requirements, we are proposing coursework meeting the national BCBA standards, which include a required 2000-hour supervised fieldwork experience as part of our practicum courses. The curriculum for the proposed degree is listed in the Program Structure Form (next section, 5.C.1). As previously noted, this 39 credit-hour program meets the nationally mandated curriculum modifications. Recent curriculum changes (i.e., renumbering) were completed create a clearer sequence of courses throughout the program. The M.S. in ABA Program will be a six-semester master's program with a course sequence that will provide learning in a logical and constructive manner. In the first semester, students will take courses involving basic principles and concepts, research methods, and behavior assessment. During their second semester, students will take courses related to behavior intervention practices and ethics in ABA. From their first Summer to second Spring semester, students will take courses involving advanced concepts, including a course on behavior-based consultation and supervision. OPEN - ASARED - 1-27 April 22, 2021Students will enroll in the first practicum course in their second semester of the program (Spring I), and thereafter in every semester until their last semester of the program (Summer II). Students enrolled in the program will be expected to accrue the 400 supervised, clock hours per semester throughout five semesters , for a total of 2000 hours (see Appendix D for BACB requirements related to supervised experience hours). Per the BACB requirements, students must have direct contact with a qualified BCBA for 5% of their hours. Students must have 20 hours of direct contact with a supervisor for each semester of practicum. The BACB allows 50% of contact hours (10 hours) to be earned under group supervision, with other BCBA candidates among groups not to exceed 10 students; the other 50% of contact hours should be earned via individual meetings supervised by a qualified BCBA supervisor. Students in the M.S. in ABA program will receive 50% of direct contact supervision during practicum courses. An UMSL faculty member, who is a qualified BCBA supervisor, will provide supervision in a group format following a curriculum designed to strengthen students' knowledge and enhance their clinical skills. The M.S. in ABA will be a clinically intensive program designed to fully prepare future BCBAs to meet all requirements for certification and develop crucial skills to perform independently in the field. Clinical Supervision Sites in the St. Louis Region. Under the new January 2022 certification requirements, BCBA candidates must accrue 2000 hours of supervised fieldwork experience involving the application of ABA. BCBA candidates typically accrue their hours in the current workplace or in sites appointed by faculty members. Distinct to UMSL's program is its respect for and embrace of BCBA program participants' (our constituents') active work environments. Their workplaces serve as labs where learned knowledge is applied and practiced. Currently, such placements are typically provided in educational or agency settings and specialized clinics where most UMSL BCBA participants work in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area. With the online M.S. program, faculty and students will work together to identify appropriate sites where the students can accrue the required hours and experiences needed to sit for the exam. Although weekly practicum hours per week can vary by site, an average of 25 hours/week of behavior analytic activities over 5 semesters, totaling 2000 hours, is required. Practica are composed of two components: 1) Direct supervision by an onsite supervisor typically employed in the student's practicum site. The supervisor will be responsible for required direct observation and individual supervision meetings with the student; and 2) Group supervision conducted in the context of the practicum courses by an UMSL qualified instructor. Group supervision will be conducted via synchronous online meetings, irrespective of whether the student placements are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Region or beyond. OPEN - ASARED - 1-28 April 22, 2021St. Louis Special School District (SSD) . Among UMSL's clinical placements for BCBA preparation is Special School District of St. Louis County (SSD) , serving more than 22,000 area students who receive special education services or technical education. For UMSL students, SSD provides supervised, clinical experiences, as well as an abundant laboratory hosting collaborative oversight ideal for experimental study, practice, and innovation. Their full range of related services incorporates a broad spectrum of behavioral interventions, including ABA, as well as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and assistive technology services considered vital for children for whom teams of educational professionals and parents develop respective Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). In addition, SSD calls upon UMSL special education faculty to assist as a resource to SSD staff through workshops and projects and to consult on cases to support unique needs of students with disabilities and their families. The College of Education, in turn, hires SSD professionals as adjunct faculty, as needed. Experienced and credentialed professionals effectively share and apply their contemporary knowledge and experiences. St. Louis Public Schools (SLPS). The St. Louis Public School district (SLPS) serves more than 3,300 students who receive special education services. UMSL has an extensive history of collaboration with SLPS, providing coursework opportunities and specialized programs of study over past decades to SLPS faculty participating in cohorts, or for those singularly seeking greater expertise and accompanying career advancement. Our BCBA program students who work full-time for the SLPS complete their supervised practicum hours on location within their own schools and/or classrooms in St. Louis. St. Louis-based private schools. In the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area, there are over 300 private schools. Many long-established and strong independent schools exist, as well as an active parochial school network. The St. Louis region is nationally ranked as having one of the largest percentages of enrollment in Catholic parochial schools, as measured by the number of registered Catholics in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area. Archdiocesan schools are also the number one employer of graduates from UMSL's Teacher Education Program. Our BCBA Program students are continually welcomed by their school leadership staff to apply behavior analytic techniques that improve particular students' individual and classroom comportment. St. Louis-based programs for children with special needs . In addition to the specialized services provided in greatest numbers by SSD and SLPS, numerous non- school clinics offer our BCBA students their on-site practicum placements with credentialed, on-site personnel available. For example, Greater St. Louis is home to agencies whose experts serve the metropolitan area and beyond, such as the St. Louis Arc, Midwest Easter Seals, YMCAs, Variety St. Louis, and the Midwest Area Brain Injury Association. OPEN - ASARED - 1-29 April 22, 2021Proximity to competitor institutions. Actively serving the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area's 2.8 million population\u2014equivalent to 46% of the State of Missouri's total population\u2014 UMSL is St. Louis' only public university that prepares nationally-approved BCBAs. Besides ours, nearby university based BCBA programs, is Lindenwood University. It is known that Lindenwood is the ABA master's degree program preferred by students who live in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area because students desire to earn a master's degree that includes the approved BCBA coursework. We have admitted into our ABA Certificate/BCBA Program several defectors, veteran Lindenwood students who claim that what attracted them initially to LU was that it provided a full master's degree program in ABA (versus UMSL's master's degree plus program). These students are attracted to UMSL because of program quality. 5.C. Program Structure As previously noted, the UMSL ABA Program is a 39-credit hour degree. The program structure comprises three components: (a) course work, (b) a series of practica (supervised clinical experiences), and (c) a capstone requirement. All courses have been approved and are in the UMSL Bulletin, although two are undergoing minor changes to course numbers to sequence them with the ABA curriculum. Courses are sequenced so that initial skills are acquired early in the program prior to the first practicum. Thereafter, coursework builds upon previous learning in earlier classes. The practica follow the courses. For example, in the first semester of the program, the focus is on basic ABA principles and behavior assessments. In the following semester, activities and assignments in Practicum 1 focus on using the basic principles of ABA as applied to assessments conducted in real work settings. Appendix L contains course syllabi, and these note course prerequisites. Appendix K is helpful to revisit because it provides the curriculum map showing the acquisition and development of skills over time throughout the curriculum. 5.C.1. Program Structure Form 1.

The degree is designed as an online graduate program with a combination of synchronous and asynchronous delivery. Coursework and practica will combine online, asynchronous instruction with occasional synchronous sessions, especially for the practica. Historically, the large majority of students completing the ABA Certificate Program have been working students with full-time jobs in schools and clinical settings. The flexibility provided by an online program can facilitate student adaptation to academic expectations while accommodating their work and personal responsibilities. We incorporated synchronous meetings in the program for two reasons: 1) We believe that direct contact among students and with instructor can facilitate the sense of community and collaboration; and 2) as per the certification requirement, the supervision involved in practica must be conducted synchronously. To ensure quality delivery of instruction, all content courses have already been or will be fully developed through guided course-development program supported by the UM-System Office of eLearning and UMSL's Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). OPEN - ASARED - 1-31 April 22, 2021In addition, course development will be supervised by a full-time, PhD-level faculty. Courses will be delivered using best practices in online teaching and learning. Quality assurance of instruction delivery will be implemented by (a) review of Canvas content by a full-time faculty; (b) end-of-course evaluation; and (c) student passing rate in the BCBA National Exam. One expectation and goal of the online M.S. in ABA program is the enrollment of students outside of the St. Louis area and across the State of Missouri. As noted earlier, with the worldwide spread of the benefits of ABA for the intervention of children and adult with developmental disabilities, there is also the potential of attracting a broader audience of students interested in behavior analysis. Finally, we recognize the potential for the online M.S. in ABA Program becoming part of the UM System initiatives in the future. Course Descriptions and Syllabi. To be approved as a Verified Course Sequence (VCS) by the ABAI, a full syllabus must be submitted for each course to ensure that students will receive instruction in all topics described in the BCBA Task List V. See Appendix L for abbreviated versions of syllabi. 5.D. Program Goals and Assessment The primary goal of the program is to prepare master's level behavior analysts, who are prepared to successfully sit for the national licensure examination and become BCBAs. The certificate program currently has a 90% retention rate and 100% graduation rate after the first year. As mentioned earlier, the national pass rate on the BCBA licensure assessment is 64.20%, but UMSL graduates have a 78.50% pass rate, which we expect to continue or improve. We also anticipate that capstone projects may qualify for presentations at state and national organizations, and some may qualify for publications in refereed journals. Graduates will continue to significantly enhance the St. Louis workforce and beyond, and we anticipate continued job placement rates exceeding 95%. The program goals are predicated on the national standards promulgated by ABAI, and as noted earlier, the courses have already been approved by ABAI. We again reference the curriculum map in Appendix K showing the acquisition and development of skills as students progress through the program Major Program Assessments. Primary programmatic assessments students will complete are: Class Participation. Students will be evaluated in their ability to participate and contribute to online lectures, discussion boards, group work, role-play, and online discussion. Students will be assessed in their critical skills, knowledge of subject, and technical language. Practical Application Assignments . Practical application assignments allow students to apply the concepts and technologies learned in the OPEN - ASARED - 1-32 April 22, 2021course to simulated situations that commonly face practicing behavior analysts. Paper Review. Students will complete and submit written reviews of empirical paper from the behavior analytical literature. The review should include all the relevant information involving the article and should conform to APA style. In addition, student might be requested to critically analyze the experimental design, results, and authors conclusions. Quizzes and Exams. Quizzes will be designed to assess the student's mastery of course content and encourage student to be prepared for class meetings. In addition, quizzes and exams will assist in preparing students for the BCBA Certificate Exam. Course Project. Students will be required to work on and submit a written report of an application project involving the practice of behavior analysts across different courses. Student will be evaluated on the appropriateness of the project, consistency with behavior analytic literature, writing style and APA format presentation. 5.E. Student Preparation The target population will be the current one, namely, prospective students from the Greater St. Louis Region. However, with the creation of a master's degree, we anticipate enrollment more students, who must possess a bachelor's degree and who desire the master's and BCBA eligibility. It is possible the online nature of the degree will attract populations beyond Missouri. Admission requirements include the Graduate School Application, copies of transcripts from former institutions, a minimum two reference letters, a letter of intent, and minimum GPA of 2.75. Because practicum requirements must be completed in an applied setting (e.g., school, clinics), students must have a suitable site prior to the second semester when the first practicum course occurs. As discussed above, UMSL is fortunate to have well-developed partnerships with schools and agencies across the St. Louis Metropolitan Area. 5.F. Faculty and Administration To assist us in reaching the goal of revising the way UMSL prepares graduate students to become BCBAs, we hired a leading researcher-practitioner in ABA from Emory University's Marcus Autism Center: Dr. Andresa De Souza, BCBA-D, who has led the development of our proposed Master's in ABA including plans for its implementation and growth. In her brief time at UMSL, Dr. De Souza has helped us change and incorporate the accreditation standards established by the ABAI into the proposed degree. OPEN - ASARED - 1-33 April 22, 2021To meet the January 2022 new BCBA accreditation standards, existing UMSL faculty expertise will be called upon to teach courses on ABA sciences and applying ABA's proven strategies in their classrooms and agencies. Dr. De Souza's international reputation in research and clinical/practical experience will continue to draw students to UMSL to gain ABA expertise from her program leadership. Further, the proposed M.S. in ABA degree program will have existing professional staff support from the College of Education's Office of Advising and Student Services. The COE has dedicated two full-time staff members, Susan Johnson and Marty Woytus, to recruitment and advising for the ABA program. To maintain the standards and requirements of the program, the department will continue identify supports to assure the administration of the program. The support is consistent with the administration of similar graduate programs in the department. Dr. Andresa De Souza, Assistant Teaching Professor will serve as the Program Director. Between teaching and overseeing all aspects of the program (e.g., recruitment, hiring of faculty, maintaining approval of course sequence, coordinating student-practicum sites), she will dedicate 60% of her time to the program with teaching corresponding to approximately 18 credit hours. Tenure track line faculty are required to teach 180 - 240 SCH per academic year while non-tenure track line faculty are required to teach 320 - 400 SCH per academic year. At the present time, Dr. De Souza is the only UMSL full-time faculty who is eligible to teach in the ABA program because of credentials requirements. We currently have a pool of part-time faculty who teaches in the ABA program: Schoenherr, Ph.D, BCBA-D, LBA. To teach in the program, instructors must have a BCBA or BCBA-D certification or have had robust graduate training in behavior analysis as demonstrated by a transcript analysis. Faculty in the ABA program must be screened and approved by ABAI to ensure that they possess the minimum credential and background to teach in an approved course sequence. ABAI has already pre-approved the UMSL full-time faculty and adjunct faculty who teach in the program. All faculty are required to complete yearly professional development to maintain their credentials. Furthermore, faculty are required to maintain their BCBA or BCBA-D certification by completing CE credits in approved events. Quality of Instruction and Student Success. Several steps will be implemented to assure and enhance the course quality of the program. At a basic level, best practices in course development and delivery of instruction will be a program expectation for program faculty and adjuncts. These include full development of each course prior to its commencement, creation of an organized and instructionally-rich Canvas course website, inclusion of multiple instructional methods (e.g., video lectures, URLs to supplemental resources, links to required and recommended readings, discussion board), and varied course requirements for evaluation of student performance. OPEN - ASARED - 1-34 April 22, 2021Students have direct contact with faculty through practicum supervision and capstone development and advisement. Programs in the UM-System Office of eLearning and UMSL's Center for Teaching and Learning will be key resources for professional development for online teaching and learning, and all faculty teaching in the program are or will certified by the UMSL CTL to teach online. 5.G. Alumni and Employer Survey As part of the program assessment plan, annual assessments via Qualtrics with graduates and their employers will be completed to ensure program quality. At graduation, the program will request job placement data, including the name and address of employers. Because many graduates stay at their current employment site, this information will be relatively easy to track. Appendix M contains drafts of the proposed program surveys. Based on the experience of the UMSL School Psychology Program, which is comparable in size to the ABA Program, we anticipate response rates of 70% or higher from alumni and employers. 5.H. Plans for Accreditation Dr. Andresa De Souza has submitted the proposal curriculum changes to the ABAI to align with the new standards for certification. Please see the previously discussed letter of approval, April 2020, in Appendix F. This association approves course sequences that enable graduates to sit for the BCBA examination; however, it also approves programs via accreditation. It is our intent to pursue accreditation once the new degree is approved. The UMSL College of Education has a long and impressive history of successful accreditation, including recognition by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Programs, and National Association of School Psychologists.

Our College of Education has long been a leader in the St. Louis region , and this new d egree proposal will continue to solidify that position within the state of Missouri by providing a streamlined master's degree that makes the necessary pivots based on current accreditation standards. The community outreach through the required internsh ip and the connections to the Special Education Program with support for disability education connect perfectly to UMSL's Strategic Plan. Additional items that make this proposal especially meaningful include not only how it is built with both increased enrol lments and an improved path -to-degree for students, but also how it will prepare students to sit for the national licensing examination and obtain the credential as Board -Certified Behavior Analyst s. Another key feature that will attract new students is how this program will prepare students more quickly and require fewer credit hours than any other institution in the St. Louis metropolitan region . It is particula rly impressive that all of this will be done without any additional start -up costs or resources. In sum, I full y support th is M.S. program in Applied Behavioral Analysis here at the University of Missouri - St. Louis and I look forward to seeing the short -time and long-term positive impact our College of Education graduates from this program will have throughout our region and state.

This degree program represents a necessary shift due to changing accreditation standards and will allow us to continue an important program. Approving this degree also allows UMSL to meet workforce demands for Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), in the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area where demand for graduates has recently seen over a 20% growth in new jobs. This program aligns with UMSL's anchor miss ion by preparing our students in an area that is in high demand not only in St. Louis but also across the state of Missouri as schools and agencies throughout the region are currently experienc ing a shortage of qualified practitioners . In full recognition of the tough financial times, this program has been created so there are no start -up costs and existing resources will be reassigned from the existing certificate program to this new M.S. degree. I fully support this proposed M.S. in Applied Behavior An alysis . I believe it will have a positive impact in our communities by creating more jobs for our graduates in schools, community agencies, hospitals, and private practices throughout our state. These behavioral analyst graduates will provide important sup port and services to children, adolescents, and adults, many of whom have developmental disorders .

Introduction The primary objective of the Bachelor of Science in Veterinary Technology (BSVT) is to further the education of pract icing veterinary technicians and to prepare them for additional successes by providing access to instruction at a nationally accredited college of veterinary medicine, without the need to relocate or interrupt employment. Historically, the s tandard education for veterinary technicians is a two -year associate's (AAS) program where the primary emphasis is on learning and performing technical skills. (Appendix B). The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has a required skill list that each student must complete to graduate from an AAS-level veterinary technology program successfully. Following their graduation, veterinary technicians must pass the Veterinary Technician National Exam (VTNE) and become licensed in their specific state as a registered/certified veterinary technician. Once these initial steps are completed, technicians' options for continuing their education, acquiring new skills to diversify their career path, or advancing within the profession are limited. The goal of the RVT- to-BSVT program is to emphasize the knowledge behind the skills while also improving communication and leadership capabilities to create highly educated and professionally competent support staff for our veterinary medicine practices within the state of Missouri and beyond. The RVT to BSVT program will establish Missouri as an industry leader in advanced veterinary technician education. One of the most exciting aspects of this endeavor is that we w ill be the first institution within the state of Missouri to offer a b achelor's degree in veterinary technology and the first college of veterinary medicine in the nation to offer a n RVT-to -BSVT program entirely online. There are currently four veterinary medicine colleges that offer veterinary technology education, and they all offer 4-year face-to -face bachelor's degree programs. 1 These programs typically take a maximum enrollment of 25-40 stud ents, due to space needed for hands -on instruction and in accordance with AVMA-CVTEA's requirements for teacher -to- student ratios when working with live animals. The RVT-to -BSVT degree plan will not be limited by these constraints and can offer the roughly 32,000 students currently enrolled in associate -level vet tech programs, and the more than 100,000 practicing veterinary technicians' access to quality education to advance their career while maintaining their employment.10,9 In preparation for this RVT -to-BSVT degree development here at Mizzou, we joined a site visit at Purdue's Veterinary Nursing Program and their guidance proved invaluable in our degree planning. The new BSVT degree w ill expand the knowledge of veterinary technicians in private veterin ary practices and c an facilitate career advancement, including practice leadership, animal hospital management, and complement the experience needed to become a veterinary technician specialist (VTS). It will also open doors into human and animal pharmaceutical sales, research laboratories, and employment with the OPEN - ASARED - 2-7 April 22, 2021 military or government regulatory agencies. If interested veterinary technicians choose to stay in private practice, a BSVT degree w ill allow for a more well-rounded education that can increase self -confidence, improve client communication, elevate patient care, and advance pet nursing competency, leading toward increased job satisfaction and hospital economic growth. Lastly, we can extrapolate from human medicine that these graduates may have more favorable clinical outcomes than associate -trained veterinary technicians. The American Association of the Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has collected extensive research that indicates that higher nursing education makes a significant difference in clinical outcomes. Offering a n RVT-to -BSVT degree at MU will reveal tremendous potential for future veterinary technology educational opportunities within the College o f Veterinary Medicine. The BSVT will highlight numerous options for certificate programs in various specialties offered at the University of Missouri Veterinary Health Center. These certificates will provide opportunity for veterinary technicians who decli ne to pursue the full BSVT degree but aspire to grow their knowledge base in specific veterinary specialties or fill gaps that may extend from their associate -level training. A bachelor's degree in veterinary technology will also be an important stepping s tone for all veterinary technicians interested in pursuing MU's Master's in Biomedical Sciences with a Veterinary Science Emphasis program, a popular degree offered through the CVM . Additionally, most BSVT students will likely be working in the profession and our goal is for this entire program to be approved by RACE (Registry of Approved Continuing Education) and allow technicians to claim their bachelor degree coursework as their yearly continuing education needed for state licensure. Conceptual discussi ons are underway at a national level, led by the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB), related to adding a mid-tier veterinary care professional (similar to a human physician's assistant) that will require masters-level training as well as an additional clinical internship at a college of veterinary medicine. If this concept comes to fruition, all veterinary technicians interested in this career path must first attain a bachelor's degree that the RVT-to - BSVT program can provide. As you can see, 2021 is an exciting time within the veterinary technology community as discussions concerning advanced degrees and the addition of a 6 -year degree path, scope of practice distinctions between 2 & 4 -year degrees, and title unification are being debated by multiple national groups, including the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB), the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), the National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America (NAVTA), the Veterinary Innovation Council (VIC), American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America (NAVTA), and the Veterinary Nurse Initiative (VNI). These groups are all working to create a more varied career path for veterinary technicians that would afford upward mobility, greater depth of proficiency, better pay, and hopefully improved job OPEN - ASARED - 2-8 April 22, 2021 satisfaction. Consequently, this advanced education w ill upgrade support staff for practicing veterinarians and enhance patie nt care for America's pet population. Although the UM system does not currently offer a degree plan in veterinary technology quite a few courses have been explicitly developed for undergraduate veterinary education within MU -CVM 's Online Programs. Therefor e, to build the RVT- to-BSVT degree plan, we will not have to start from scratch, as the proposed curriculum only includes four new courses. This degree plan aims to provide a pathway to a baccalaureate degree that will permit transfer of previous veterinar y technology education and finish with a credential that is specific for student's chosen profession. We developed the BSVT curriculum using guidelines from the AVMA for bachelor -level degrees and recommendations outlined by the Veterinary Innovation Council (VIC) in their 2 -yr. vs. 4-yr Education Project Report, as well as a large volume of feedback from RVT and DVM's within MU's Veterinary Health Center and private practices across the state. According to the AVMA, Missouri is one of 33 states in the US t hat do not offer an in - state bachelor's degree in veterinary technology: AL, AR, CO, CT, DE, HI, ID, IL, IA, KS, MD, MN, MO, MT, N E NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, OH, OK, OR, RI, SC, SD, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, & WY. Of these states, the Bureau of Labor and Statistic s' Occupational Statistics notes that Illinois is a high demand state, and Colorado, North Carolina, Maryland, and Minnesota are all states with the highest concentration of jobs and location quotients for the occupation of veterinary technology, which is encouraging for out -of-state interest in this program.9 Noted in attached letters of support (Appendix C), several out-of-state veterinary technician programs support our proposed plan and have students currently interested in enrolling. The CVM's BSVT pro gram also aligns with the AVMA's task force on veterinary technology recommendations that COE-accredited veterinary colleges should develop or host accredited programs in veterinary technology. The College of Veterinary Medicine at MU is passionate about c reating this online RVT -to-BSVT degree plan to be a nationwide source of opportunity for veterinary technicians. If there are any questions, please contact Cindy Cravens, DVM at: W103 Veterinary Medicine Building, by phone at (573) 884 -8454, or by email at ccfx3@umsystem.edu. 2. University Mission & Program Analysis 2.A. Alignment with University Mission & Goals The UM System has set a vision to \"advance the opportunities for success and well - being for Missouri, our nation and the world through transformative teaching, research, innovation, engagement and inclusion.\" The RVT-to -BSVT program at the CVM will advance opportunities for success and well -being of veterinary technicians in the state o f Missouri and nationwide, secondary to providing a pathway to a OPEN - ASARED - 2-9 April 22, 2021 baccalaureate degree that is currently only offered at three other online programs (St. Petersburg College, Tarleton State University, and Penn Foster College). Providing this route for completion of a bachelor's degree that is clinically relevant and specific to the needs of non -traditional, working veterinary technician s will positively impact enrollment growth for MU, as these students will all be new students for the university. The strate gic priorities at the University of Missouri are in direct alignment with the RVT-to -BSVT program, especially regarding student success. Through this program, we can encourage and support faculty who are committed to excellent teaching as a critical component of student success . As educators, we have a responsibility to enhance learning experiences and be thoughtful stewards of resources. The MU campus houses an accredited college of veterinary medicine with many world-renown veterinary educators. However, veterinary paraprofessionals have little to no access to this quality education due to lack of a pathway for credit transfer, or degree plans specific to the veterinary technology profession. This gap in educational opportunities for veterinary technicians at the CVM is an inefficient use of campus resources that could provide superior advanced veterinary technology education. An asynchronous, online RVT-to -BSVT degree can increase flexible paths to learning and degree completion by allowing RVT's to advance their education while continuing to work in the profession. This advanced education can also increase professional development and improve career outcomes for practicing veterinary technicians who desire leverage for higher salaries and enhanced training in soft skills specific to successful veterinary medical care and leadership . In addition to the need for a bachelor's program to advance registered veterinary technicians' education, this degree program may become a stepping stone to a master's level veterinary professional that includes additional licensure. A NAVTA study from March 2020 revealed that 80% out of 703 veterinary technician respondents are interested in developing a conceptual APVN (Advanced Practice Veterinary Nurse) credential thro ugh a veterinary nursing graduate program at a college of veterinary medicine. 16 Discussions will continue on a national level over the establishment and logistics of such a plan and its required internships, credentialing exam, and scope of practice. The proposition of creating a new credentialed veterinary professional is in response to the chronic issue that has troubled the profession for over a decade: too few veterinarians and veterinary technicians to meet the growing demands of pet owners. This BSVT program will be the start of establishing infrastructure at the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine to build upon to meet the rising demands within the veterinary health care community. Therefore, the RVT -to-BSVT program can emphasize ar eas of broader impacts to promote education, outreach, and benefits to society regarding access to quality veterinary care. OPEN - ASARED - 2-10 April 22, 2021 Regardless of the advanced practice credential in veterinary technology, the College of Veterinary Medicine's Online Programs already offers a master's program in Biomedical Sciences with an emphasis in Veterinary Sciences. Current NAVTA president, Ken Yagi, is a graduate of this master's program, and it is quite popular with veterinary technicians including several of our BSVT instruc tors and veterinary technicians employed at MU's Veterinary Health Center. Offering an RVT-to -BSVT degree plan, whose graduates can then enroll in an established master's degree program will optimize organizational structures to achieve teaching and engagement objectives at the College of Veterinary Medicine. Evaluation of the veterinary profession show that societal demands continue to evolve; therefore, it is necessary to train a diverse workforce of exceptional animal health professionals to meet these needs. Developing the RVT -to-BSVT program will create more highly skilled veterinary technicians that can provide superior service for the nation's veterinary community, livestock producers, pet owners, and veterinary health corporations to contribute to economic growth. Additionally, just as human nurses improved their clinical outcomes with advanced degree training in human nursing care, we foresee that the same could be true for veterinary technicians and their ability to care for their animal patie nts. In the March 2019 issue of The Joint Commission Journal of Quality and Patient Safety, Dr. Maya Djukic and her colleagues from New York University released details from a new study, which found that baccalaureate -prepared RNs reported being significantly better prepared than associate degree nurses on 12 out of 16 areas related to quality and safety, including evidence -based practice, data analysis, and project implementation. According to the Missouri Veterinary Medical Board, there are currently 1,273 licensed veterinary technicians in the state. This number is expected to grow considerably, as Moberly Area Community College's (MACC) new veterinary technology program will begin producing 32 graduates a year starting in the spring of 2023. An articulation agreement has been established between the College of Veterinary Medicine and MACC to create a uniform transfer into MU's RVT-to -BSVT program following MACC -AAS graduation (Appendix L). In addition, an MOU creating a partnership has been signed by both institutions to facilitate AAS vet tech students to participate in hands -on veterinary technician training at MU's Veterinary Health Center while enrolled at MACC, providing economic workforce development for central Missouri and meeting the state's need for licensed veterinary technicians. In return MACC will encourage their AAS-VT graduates to enroll in the RVT-to -BSVT program. This degree plan can serve all veterinary technicians by being a flagship of the future, benefitting the increasing number of veterinary technicians who elect to pursue advanced degrees. Becoming the first college of veterinary medicine to offer an RVT-to -BSVT degree plan is an exciting endeavor. We aspire to be a national leader in the profession and OPEN - ASARED - 2-11 April 22, 2021 become the school of choice for outstanding veterinary technician education at an advanced level. These aspirations are in direct alignment with the university policy of enhancing the development of individuals and the well-being of society, and in this case, the well-being of society 's four-legged family members. 2.B. Duplication & Collaboration within Campus, Across System Duplication is not anticipated, as there are currently no bachelor's degrees available in veterinary techn ology through the UM system. Furthermore, there are no bachelo r- level degrees offered in the state of Missouri in veterinary technology. There are 25 bachelors' in veterinary technology degrees offered in the nation, but only three are entirely online completion degrees. MU's College of Veterinary Medicine Online Programs currently offers an undergraduate certificate in veterinary sciences. This certificate is primarily obtained by pre-veterinary undergraduate students. There is no expectation for competition between these programs due to differing student target audiences. At the college level, the BSVT will generate and enhance collaboration across departments within the college of veterinary medicine as our program includes instructors from veterinary pathobiology, veterinary medicine and surgery, and biomedical sciences. 3. Business-Related Criteria & Justification 3.A. Market Analysis 3.A.1. Rationale and Workforce Demand for the Program There is an obligation within the veterinary community to have knowledgeable nursing staff for animal patients, mirroring what is available in human health care. Veterinary technicians were listed among the top 20 fastest growing occupations in Missouri from 2017-2019. However, there is a constant need for more well-trained applicants for veter inary technology, animal laboratory technology, pharmaceutical and animal health industry, veterinary practice managers, and veterinary technician specialists. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , veterinary technicians occupy a high-growth career. Our latest market analysis shows occupational growth projections for 2020-2030 at both national and regional levels to be above average at twenty percent nationally and nineteen percent regionally (Appendix J). The BLS' projected a nineteen percent rise in openings for vet techs across the country between 2018 and 2028, which is nearly triple the average growth anticipated across all occupations during that same time (7 percent). According to data from www.projectionscentral.com for 2016 -2026, veterinary technicians/technologists will have 10,700 average annual openings. OPEN - ASARED - 2-12 April 22, 2021 Additionally, the Bureau of Labor and Statics reported in 2018 that there are 106,680 veterinary technicians in the United States. According to the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association), there are 8,000 more new graduates every year. The latest Committee on Veterinary Technology Education & Activities (CVTEA) Vet Tech Director Survey reports that there are 34,677 students currently enrolled in an AAS vet tech program. 10 But unfortun ately, the 2016 NAVTA (National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America) Demographic Survey indicated 45% of respondents had left the vet tech profession due to low income and lack of career advancement. When evaluating this lack of job satisfacti on in veterinary technology, the survey noted \"there is a known shortage of credentialed vet techs, and the difficulty in finding qualified personnel to fill positions is a major complaint by veterinary practices .\" There is plenty of data that demonstrates the need for veterinary technicians both regionally and nationally. But the biggest question that faces the profession of veterinary technology today: how can we enhance job satisfaction to improve retention? The NAVTA survey was specific in 3 reasons why so many licensed veterinary technicians are leaving the profession: minimal utilization of nursing skills , lack of options for career variance and upward mobility, and low salaries . Part of what makes the RVT-to -BSVT program so unique is that we can elevate our graduate's knowledge base and proficiencies crucial to veterinary practice. This advanced credential can open doors for leadership opportunities within their current employment place or expand into other genres of the animal health fields. Additionally, we plan to include in our RVT -to-BSVT program marketing plan outreach to the DVM community to provide education on proper technician utilization and the many benefits of having highly-trained support staff for their veterinary clinics. Lastly, research performed here at the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine in 2019 would indicate that obtaining a bachelor's degree in veterinary technology would be an excellent investment as it would positively influence veterinary technician' s salaries . This same article discussed that \"online access to degree -granting institutions allows more opportunities for veterinary technicians to obtain advanced degrees.\" Additional education can increase the veterinary technician's value within the vet erinary medicine community and improve salaries and skill utilization. OPEN - ASARED - 2-13 April 22, 2021 Earning an advanced degree, such as a bachelor's degree , improves job retention rate and allows graduates the opportunity to pursue varied career paths .9 The veterinary field is continuously advancing, developing new systems, and discovering new treatment methods. Veterinary technicians are encouraged to become lifelong learners to offer better patient care and improve animal healthcare throughout their community. However, based on the current market analysis, there are very few options nationally and zero regionally that can offer this advanced education (Appendix J). The market evaluations performed both in 2019 and 2020 for this program showed zero listings for job listings that were specific for a bachelor degree in veterinary technology. However, we suspect that this is due to a lack of qualified applicants in the region at this time, and expect that the job market will respond to an influx of higher trained veterinary technicians f ollowing program establishment. It is important to offer these paraprofessionals options to increase their salary or change their career outlook, so we retain them in the profession and avoid additional workforce shortages in veterinary medical practices where these animal caretakers are in high demand. Affordability is also paramount for this program's success when targeting non- traditional students who often will be supporting families and a population of workers that are consistently associated with low wages . According to our Burning Glass Market Analysis, CVM's current tuition and fees are quite competitive compared to the two major online competitors. It is important to note that none of 3 online RVT - to-BSVT programs will be housed in a college of vete rinary medicine. The tuition rate/credit hour for non -resident, distance-learning, undergraduate programs at MU - CVM is $4 70/cr for a 40-credit BSVT program, St. Petersburg College is $425.79/cr for a 41-credit BAS program, and Tarleton St. University is $595.65/cr for a 40-credit BAS program. (Appendix I) OPEN - ASARED - 2-14 April 22, 2021 As well as evaluating job markets for BSVT graduates and affordability for perspective BSVT students, we wanted to survey practicing DVM's that em ploy veterinary technicians at their clinics. To evaluate employer demand and support for an RVT-to -BSVT program , we reached out to referring veterinarians using MU's VHC referral DVM list serve . Our survey had 50 practicing veterinarians that responded, and of those respondents, 69% practiced in the state of Missouri. The full survey can be viewed in Appendix K. Two specific responses that were encouraging of the BSVT program development are listed here: Yes Maybe No Would you support your RVT/CVT employees furthering their education by pursuing a bachelor's degree if totally online and asynchronous, so they could continue to work while in school? 83.67% 8.16% 8.16% Would you offer any financial support for interested employees if most courses were RACE certified and eligible for use as yearly CE? 38.78% 48.98% 12.24% We have also had several regional and national industry leaders in veterinary medicine step forward with support for an RVT-to -BSVT program. We are thrilled to include endorsements from KC Animal Health Corridor, BioNexus KC, and VCA (Veterinary Clinics of America). Including support of such wide-reaching corporate partners that employ many veterinary technicians regionally and nation ally will promote program success. (Appendix C) The BSVT degree program has received positive feedback and is generating a dramatic amount of enthusiasm across administration here at the CVM, as well as among AAS-VT programs, state organizations, and animal health industry partners. The numerous letters of support show the tremendous backing for this program is wide-ranging and abundant. These letters (Appendix C) provide an example of just how large this program's administrative backing is. 3.A.2 Student Demand for the Program Twenty-five institutions currently offer a bachelor's degree in veterinary technology, and according to the AVMA CVTEA in 2019-2020, there were 1936 students enrolled in these programs. Of these 25 bachelor -level programs, most require some or all face-to -face coursework; there are only three bachelor completion programs for veterinary technology that are offered entirely online: St. Petersburg College in FL, PennFoster College in AZ, and Tarleton State University in TX. There is no college of veterinary medicine that currently offers a RVT-to -BSVT degree in veterinary technology online, and only four CVM's that offer any veterinary technology education at all (Purdue, Michigan State, Lincoln Memorial, and Mississippi State). OPEN - ASARED - 2-15 April 22, 2021 As the rising interest in advanced degrees in veterinary technology is highlighted, such as AAVMC's (American Association of Veterinary Medicine Colleges) 2020 publishing of \"Development of Advanced Veterinary Nursing Degrees: Rising Interest Levels for Careers as Advanced Practice Registered Veterinary Nurses\", the more the veterinary community is going to have to reevaluate the options currently offered to veterinary technicians. 3 The BLS states that there are currently 10 6,680 veterinary technicians, however the AVMA estimates that there are more likely 56,000 veterinary technicians (with the BLS also including veterinary assistants who have not earned a degree and license) that are currently practicing in North America. 9 Regardless of which number is accurate, the current options for these potentially 50,000-100,000 practicing veterinary technicians if they want to further their education or career, is to attend one of three online bachelor's completion programs, or relocate to another area that offers an in -seat completion program. This lack of access is a driving force for MU to be the first college of veterinary medicine to offer a two-year degree completion, entirely online and asynchronous, to allow students to stay ac tive in their careers while pursuing this advanced education. To gauge student demand, we contacted regional veterinary technology programs that are currently offering associate level degrees and asked their students to participate in an anonymous survey. We were pleased to have 14 2 responses, which included a majority of positive feedback in pursuing additional education following their graduation, as well as assessing interest in potential courses. Yes Maybe No Would you be interested in pursuing a bachelor's degree if available online, so you could take classes while employed? 83.80% 15.49% 0.70% Would an advantageous credit transfer to pursue a bachelor's degree? 92.25% 6.34% 1.41% Recommendations of topics that students would like to see in cluded in the program was also discussed in the surv ey. Responses included : large animal nursing, exotic animal care, anesthesia, business management, and pharmacology as the most common recommendations. Of the seventy -five responses, fifty-four of those topics are already included in our program and we look forward to adding additional content as the program grows and succeeds. OPEN - ASARED - 2-16 April 22, 2021 Table 1a. Student Enrollment Projections (anticipated total number of students enrolled in the program during the first five fall semesters following implementation.)

Projected Number of Degrees Awarded Year: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # of Degrees Awarded 0 10 12 28 32 42 48 56 64 72 These student enrollment projections and degrees awarded have been re vised since submission of the program preproposal and pro forma, due to new veterinary industry support, further consideration of survey feedback , and assessment of new information that facilitated comparison to similar programs. The anticipated initial enrollment is now 25 students, instead of 20 , secondary to a high volume of Missouri practicing veterinary technicians that have reached out following the employer survey distribution . Additionally, when evaluating the student survey that had 14 2 respondents, over 70 students reported that they are interested in pursuing a bachelor's degree despite additional financial costs of attending at a college of veterinary medicine. Student enrollment growth each year was estimated to go up starting in year three of the program to 10 additional new students/year, instead of 5. This is due to MU - CVM's partnership with Moberly Area Community College and their AAS-VT program will begin graduating 32 students annually in Spring 2023 . Both institutions have already signed an MOU that o utline this partnership (Appendix M) and are i n agreement that an articulation agreement can provide a seamless transfer of credit for their AAS-VT program into MU's BSVT program. It is important to note that many of these students will have gone through the MACC program with an A+ scholarship OPEN - ASARED - 2-17 April 22, 2021 and may be entering MU with junior status and relatively little financial debt. Finally , they will have the opportunity to be working within the profession while attending this online degree plan as well. Additionally, distribution of full -time and part-time student enrollments have stayed at 50/50 secondary to the fact that many perspective students who have reached out to the CVM for more information about the program have emphasized an interest to finish the degree plan within two-years. A majority of these veterinary technicians are excited to use this credential to open doors into new career opportunities. Ten students specifically mentioned the hope for the development of a veterinary physician's assistant or APVN and desire to get their bachelor's promptly t o facilitate preparedness for this future career possibility. Although these students may not all take 20 credit hours both years, these estimations appear to be more accurate than 10 credits per year. Finally, we evaluated 4 -year, in -person, programs such as Murray State who had 90+ conferrals in 2016 and 2017 according to our Burning Glass Market Analysis (Appendix I). St. Petersburg College has an online bachelor's completion program most similar to our RVT-to -BSVT program and they have curr ently listed 125 enrollments in this BAS degree plan. Therefore, we are optimistic that we can provide access to a quality education to both newly graduated novice veterinary technician as well as those veter inarians who have been in the profession and are looking for new opportunities. 3.B. Financial Projection 3.B.1 Additional Resources Needed The CVM is fortunate to have generous alumni and donors that contribute to their alma mater, such as Jim Nave, DVM. Dr. Nave has recently made a large donation to MU's College of Veterinary Medicine and has specified that $180,000 should fund the launch of the BSVT program. Dr. Nave recognizes that the BSVT will serve an essential population within the veterinary community and answer a real need for additional veterinary technology education opportunities. With this tremendous support, it is likely that expenses incurred during the initial years of program will be covered. If the anticipated enrollments do not meet estimations, optional support funds may be borrowed from the CVM's \"Dean's Fund for Excellence\" and will be repaid to that fund when the program begins to produce a profit. The program's online format enables reduced costs and minimal staffing during preliminary years, including a program director, to sta rt year one, and a BSVT advisor , to start in year two. These employees will take care of transcripts, transfer credit, and confirming articulation agreements are in place for each enrolled student in the BSVT program. OPEN - ASARED - 2-18 April 22, 2021 Operating expenses of this program are relatively low since it is offered entirely online and will not have any in -seat instruction. The director's office is already outfitted with technology and furniture and there is an additional desk available that can be used for a program advisor. Budgeted costs i nclude one additional computer and space overhead/ rent for the two offices to be used in the Veterinary Medicine Building on MU's campus, as well as costs for supplies to be used by the two program employees, including membership dues for regional and national organizations . Being an online program will alleviate expenses associated with equipment costs and maintenance and repair. Very little or no change in long -term operating expenditures is anticipated for this program. A primary operating expense for this degree plan will be dedicated to marketing the program nationwide. It is vital to market aggressively in the first few years of the program, as we plan to make the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, the premier university for advanced online education in veterinary technology. 3.B.2. Revenue All students interested in this bachelor's completion degree will be new to the University of Missouri and the College of Veterinary Medicine. The UM system currently offers some courses focused on veterinary technicians; however, without an ability to transfer their associate -level credits, we have lost out on the opportunity to bring many of these veterinary paraprofessionals to our college. Also, offer ing a degree plan specific to their needs as veterinary technicians, we should gain a whole new following of interested students. The BSVT pro forma has also been updated with MU's estimated undergraduate discount rate for tuition for the 2021 -2022 school year. (BSVT Pro Forma). These discounts will increase MU's ability to provide scholarship funding of general benefit to all undergraduate students in MU. Enrollment projections included in the attached pro forma document include an estimated full -time student taking 20 hr/year and graduating after two years and part -time students taking 10 hr/year and graduating in four years. We estimated a total program attrition for both full and part-time students to be 20% across their 2 -4-year enrollment (Appendix E). W e used numbers from St. Petersburg College for comparison since they offer a bachelor's completion degree entirely online. Their program attrition is consistently around 20%, and they typically have a 95% graduation rate after the first year of schooling. We do not expect our program to receive ear-marked state support , nor will it draw from any existing University of Missouri core institutional budget. 3.B.3. Net Revenue The BSVT program's primary strength is that it is entirely online, and no space or equipment will need to be added to the college to offer this degree plan. Further, the OPEN - ASARED - 2-19 April 22, 2021 ability to build from a foundation of previously available courses, eliminates the need to hire a large number of new instructors to cover this coursework. In anticipation of the new degree, many of the CVM instructors have already developed their courses for the BSVT program, and most are already certified as online instructors through Mizzou's Office of eLearning. This dedication to keeping expenditures down in combination with high-interest le vels within the veterinary community will ensure program success within the first few years. OPEN - ASARED - 2-20 April 22, 2021 Table 2. BSVT Financial Projections for Years 1-5 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 1. Expenses per year A.

Academic and Financial Viability The revised program plan targets enrollment of at least 100 active students participating in the RVT -to-BSVT program by year four (FY2025). The asynchronous learning network will enable students to manage their own time and priorities while working individ ually and collaboratively with classmates from diverse backgrounds, often across multiple time and geographical zones. Classes that cannot create this specific atmosphere will diminish the community experience and reduce the chances of veteran and novice v eterinary technicians working together to elevate the group's learning experience. In the early years of the program, we plan to offer 15/20 courses each year to rotate some of the electives on an every -other -year basis. A goal of 100 students participatin g in classes distributed over three semesters should include close to 20 students/course and drive the vibrant learning community atmosphere. Our goal will be a minimum of 90 students to be financially viable and self-sufficient by year four of the RVT -to-BSVT program. This viability figure was determined by evaluating the BSVT Pro Forma FY2025 revenue along with the additional assumption that the resource allocation model will be in effect at this time. Table 3. Enrollment for Academic and Financial Viabi lity Viability Minimum Enrollment Academic 100 Financial 90 Overall 100 3.C. Business Plan: Marketing, Student Success, Transition & Exit Strategies 3.C.1. Marketing Plan A new program such as the RVT-to -BSVT degree plan will require an aggressive marketing plan to confirm that both veteran and newly graduated veterinary technicians are aware of this opportunity to continue their education online and self - paced. This campaign will have a several -step approach, starting with our communications department creating a virtual introduction using the broad reach of MU-CVM's distribution list and social media presence. Additionally, Missouri Veterinary Medical Association and Misso uri Veterinary Technology Association has offered to distribute paper mailers and provide additional social media presence for this introduction. Information about the degree program will be included in the College of Veterinary Medicine website and Mizzou 's eLearning website as well. We also plan to collaborate with Mizzou's Office of eLearning to market the program as extensively as possible on a national level. The CVM and OeL have had success in OPEN - ASARED - 2-22 April 22, 2021 the past advertising through various social media platform s. On the marketing summary for the CVM in 2019-2020, it appears the most successful approach for veterinary technology is targeted advertising with NAVTA, where social media spots averaged a cost of $8.82/inquiry (Appendix N ). To reach a national audience, we plan to market the RVT-to -BSVT program at national conventions such as American Veterinary Medical Association Conference, FETCH national conference, and Western States Veterinary Conferences, as well as more regional conventions such as Misso uri Veterinary Medical Association. Additionally, once the BSVT program is approved, we plan to reach out to our industry partnerships, such as VCA and KCAHC, so that we can spread the word through their large organizations. Along with this national virtual marketing campaign, we plan to target regional AAS-VT programs that do not already offer a bachelor's option within their program. The next step of this marketing plan will include the BSVT program director offering in-person/zoom seminars that will have more specifics about the degree plan, provide future options for practicing veterinary technicians, and inform listeners of any current events affecting the profession of veterinary technology. Furthermore, the director will need to confirm that articulation agreements can be put into place with all interested veterinary technology programs to facilitate students' easy credit transfer. Additionally, we plan to offer similar presentations to state and regional veterinary and veterinary technician associations to communicate this fantastic opportunity to potential students and their employers. Getting our introduction distributed in the first year will be the most important and why we budgeted $50,000 for marketing expenses for this year. As the program grows, the focus will shift to using a majority of testimonials from graduates, current students, and satisfied employers to convey the benefits of an online program like the BSVT. 3.C.2. Student Success Plan The MU College of Veterinary Medicine is exceptionally passionate about both the development and success of this BSVT program. We want to create a program that will promote learner -centered education and include personalized academic guidance by our BSVT director, and later the BSVT advisor. An in-depth discussion will evaluate the student's readiness for continuing education and confirm that admission requirements and associate-level credit are eligible for transfer at this preliminary intake session. This meeting intends to identify if a student's family and economic concerns might impact their ability to excel in the program and collaborate with them to establish resources for success. Students will also be required to complete an online \"BSVT Readiness C ourse\" before starting the curriculum. This online module offered through their canvas interface will survey students on study skills, information technology skills, readiness to learn, motivation, time management, and support space. Each student that flags one of these OPEN - ASARED - 2-23 April 22, 2021 issues as a concern for them when they start the program will then be offered a list of resources to improve knowledge, capability, or comfort in these categories. This aspect of preparation before the start of coursework is vital for our st udent success as many of our students will be non-traditional and have various work and family obligations to consider. Once the module is complete and resources have been sent, students will need to submit a written improvement plan explaining how they plan to overcome stumbling blocks associated with these flagged topics. Along with this module, canvas will house important information to welcome students into the program, including options for their personalized learning plan, information about academic integrity, honesty, and plagiarism, accessibility resources, tutoring information, and an introduction to the comprehensive learning record. Also, we recommend a virtual information management seminar with our CVM librarian on all aspects of our virtual Zal k Veterinary Library, effective note -taking, and discussion on evidence -based medicine. Incorporated in this virtual readiness information will be links to MU campus wellness resources, including phone consultation and 24/7 crisis support, online seminars offered through MU Wellness Resource Center, and information about the Sanvello app. We want our students to have multiple options to understand and manage their stress and mental wellness and hope they will take some of those best practices into their wo rk in the veterinary community after graduation. In the first semester of the program, we encourage a career development meeting with our BSVT director to build off data established in the original advisement session. This meeting will encourage students to set academic and career goals and further refine their personalized learning plan. The learning plan will verify the number of credits they want to take each semester, plan on what electives they want to include, which semesters they are available, and their tentative graduation date. Preparing our students early in the program, with the tools they can reach for when classes and life get overwhelming, are critical for student success. The focus following these initial meetings will allow students to lead their success plan. However, we will recommend advisement sessions to facilitate early intervention if a student begins to struggle. In the second to last semester of the program, the student will have a follow -up meeting with our BSVT advisor or program director to confirm that all courses are in place for graduation the following semester. They will also be encouraged to provide feedback in surveys before beginning their senior year and again at graduation. These surveys will provide the feedback needed to gauge if the program meets expectations and evaluates students and graduates' satisfaction. OPEN - ASARED - 2-24 April 22, 2021 3.C.3. Transition Plan With full support from the CVM Dean, program success will rely primarily with the BSVT program director. The director must develop par tnerships with AAS-VT programs and then establish articulation agreements that provide a bridge into our program. The director will communicate with the Dean, offering regular updates, and will be in charge of the continued development of the program, marketing, and cultivating relationships for recruitment purposes and employer feedback. If a new director is appointed, they will have to jump in to continue to promote these relationships; however, the overall program should stay on a steady level of achievement due to the collaboration of other full and part-time employees devoted to this program's success. Having an advisor 100% dedicated to the program will make it possible to facilitate the new program direction with relative ease for students. The advisor will continue to be the point person for both enrolled students and potential future students and monitoring the transfer credit of all students newly enrolled at MU. The Director of Veterinary Online Programs will continue to oversee all online coursework and help with instructor contact, so there are no negative repercussions to program quality during a leadership change. Lastly, the College of Veterinary Medicine plans to continue its dedication to see this program succeed. The CVM will support the director in any way possible to see this program thrive and offer the best possible advanced education to all practicing veterinary technicians across the US. 3.C.4. Exit Strategy The Bachelor of Science in Veterinary Technology degree will be a unique program that will bring students to the College of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Missouri that would otherwise not enroll at this institution. Using our student survey as a gauge, we anticipate a n extensive interest in this program from veterinary technicians across the nation ( Appendix A). However, if the program's headcount cannot meet the goal of 60-70 students actively enrolled by year three (FY2024), we plan to alter the program to a phased -down form. This approach will include decreasing the frequency of courses offered and excluding less popular electives from the program to manage expenditures. During this phased -down time, the program director will continue to market the program as best po ssible while keeping travel and other expenses to a minimum. Additionally, no new courses will be added, although we may consider adding certificate programs to increase revenue if we can verify stakeholder interest. The BSVT program director and the Colle ge of Veterinary Medicine's Executive Dean of Finance will be monitoring the program's budget closely and evaluating options for increasing revenue and decreasing expenditures as best possible. Our initial goals for OPEN - ASARED - 2-25 April 22, 2021 the program are to be self -sustaining wi thin the first few years and then push to increase enrollment to allow for a thriving learning community that will lend itself to providing an excellent student experience. MACC's AAS-VT program will have its first graduates in the Spring of 2023, and our articulation agreement will provide many of these students to immediately enter the BSVT program in FY2024. We expect to see an increase in enrollments at this time secondary to this exciting partnership. Additional evaluations will continue every year, including a thorough viability evaluation in FY2025. If the RVT -to-BSVT program fails to reach 100 active student enrollments by FY2026, it will move to inactive status. This inactive standing will entail no new enrollments, teaching out current students, and working to make innovations to the program format or terminate the program at the end of FY2026. 4. Institutional Capacity One of the many strengths of the BSVT degree plan is that there is a large volume of courses already being offered through Veteri nary Online Programs. A majority of BSVT program instructors have a long history of teaching in an online setting and creating courses aligned with quality matters and now five pillars quality review recommendations. Dr. Laurie Wallace, Director of Veterinary Online Programs, Dr. C.B. Chastain, Advisor for Veterinary Online Programs, and Mrs. June Kelly, Business Support Specialist, are the current faculty and staff that will provide support for the BSVT degree. Veterinary Online Programs (Wallace, Chastain, Kelly), an interdepartmental program within the College of Veterinary Medicine, began offering online courses for registered veterinary technicians in 2009, expanded courses to include online pre - veterinary elective courses, and delivered the first compr ehensive online Master's course for veterinary professionals in 2014 with initial graduates in 2017. Veterinary Online Programs now offers an online graduate certificate and two online undergraduate certificates. Mizzou Online (now UM System Office of eLearning) staff and instructional designers from MU Course Design and Technology (formerly ET@MO) have been involved in developing the Veterinary Online Programs courses, degree programs, and certificates. Our current educational designer is Amanda Stafford, and our Office of eLearning educational coordinator is Lindsey Boudinot, who offer invaluable support and guidance. Since the BSVT program is offered entirely online, its stress on campus resources should be minimal to null, and the program curriculum will only have to add four new courses. We are excited that in this online medium, we can encourage peer interaction via discussion boards and continue to foster an active learning environment from differing perspectives of the profession, without additional time-intensive OPEN - ASARED - 2-26 April 22, 2021 requirements from instructors. We plan to have every BSVT course evaluated by the Office of eLearning and go through a full quality review process prior to its launch. The University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine Online Program s already has a strong foundation established to build this degree. We have entrenched faculty devoted to seeing the program succeed and have the knowledge and tools to offer coursework that is both academically and clinically relevant to potential students. A majority of faculty also have years of experience working with Mizzou's Office of eLearning Course Design and Technology to develop elite online courses and facilitate an active learning community. 5. Program Characteristics 5.A. Program Outcomes BSVT Program Learning Outcomes: 1. Develop confidence in personal leadership and utilize interprofessional communication skills to serve as a role model and a leader in the workplace. 2. Use veterinary medical terminology and advanced knowledge in veterinary technology to effectively discuss normal and abnormal conditions of animals. 3. Integrate and apply knowledge of veterinary technician specialties to effectively and appropriately provide veterinary nursing care in such domains as (but not limited to): a. Animal behavior b. Lab animal medicine and research c. Clinical pathology d. Small animal physical rehabilitation e. Equine nursing f. Farm animal nursing g. Animal nutrition h. Veterinary emergency and critical care i. Small animal neurology j. Veterinary clinical practice k. Veterinary toxicology 4. Develop and apply advanced principles of veterinary practice management to make economically sound professional decisions, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and contribute to a prosperous hospital environment. 5. Utilize appropriate written, verbal, and non -verbal skills to communicate with diverse populations through a variety of mediums. 6. Identify ethical and animal welfare dilemmas and apply a process for making critical choices and actions using compassion, integrity, respect, and responsibility. 7. Blend previous learning and develop advanced knowledge in veterinary anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and clinical pathology. OPEN - ASARED - 2-27 April 22, 2021 Special Skills specific to this program: All students admitted to this program have completed training to become a registered veterinary technician. This requires proficiency in essential skills identified by the AVMA CVTEA (American Veterinary Medical Association Committee on Veterinary Technician Education Accreditation) and passing their national licensure examination (Veterinary Technician National Exam). 5.B. Program Design & Content Veterinary technology programs are accredited and monitored by the AVMA's (American Veterinary Medical Association) CVTEA (Committee of Veterinary Technology Educations & Activities). This accrediting body has specific requirements set in place for 2 -year & 4-year vet tech degrees, which require both degree plans to emphasize completion of \"Veterinary Technology Student Essential and Recommended Skills List\" (Appendix B). All 4-year veterinary technology degree holders are considered \"technologists,\" while 2-year degree holders are considered \"technicians.\" However, there are currently no additional skills or licensure examinations that are specific to 4 -year degree holders or RVT-to BSVT graduates . The CVTEA also does not have any explicit guidelines for a bachelor's completion degree. However, if at some point there becomes a mid -tier master's-level veterinary professional, or the VIC is successful in creating sc ope of practice recommendations for 2-year vs. 4-year degrees, there w ill be additional accredit ation and licensing exam requirements established. Currently, the CVTEA recommends that programs offering baccalaureate degrees develop curricula that distinguish the program from an associate degree program. Per the CVTEA website, the baccalaureate degree program may expand veterinary exposure and offer added value options such as: Laboratory Animal Medicine, Practice Management/Business, Research, Education, Emergency/Critical Care, Anesthesia, Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Dentistry, and Internal Medicine. All these recommendations were considered when deciding what courses to include in this degree completion, and we hope to add additional courses as the program grows. (Appendix F) The Veterinary Innovation Council (VIC) also developed a task force to es tablish the \"High-Value Veterinary Technician Initiative: 2 -yr vs. 4-yr Education Project\". 5 In their report, they concluded that the added value in 4 -year education programs should primarily emanate from the expansion of general education along with communication, critical thinking, leadership, management, and perhaps business to position these graduates as well-trained to assume team leadership roles in the workplace. The task force also discussed the potential added value of training veterinary technicians within a college of veterinary medicine and recommended new accreditation processes and n ew certifying exams for these graduates and are OPEN - ASARED - 2-28 April 22, 2021 currently working with the AAVSB (American Association of Veterinary State Boards) and CVTEA to make these changes a reality. The VIC's recommendations emphasized coursework including but not limited to: gene ral education, communication, critical thinking, leadership, ethics, staff development and mentoring, self -care and wellbeing, risk management, and practice management fundamentals. They also recommended expanding previous knowledge in: emergency and critical care, dentistry, internal medicine, anesthesia and analgesia, laboratory animals, behavior, clinical pathology, clinical practice, dermatology, equine nursing, physical rehabilitation, nutrition, ophthalmology, surgery, zoological medicine, and diagnostic imaging. These focus areas are emphasized as they are all NAVTA (National Association of Veterinary Technicians Association) recognized veterinary technician specialties (VTS), and this program will be a fantastic compliment for technicians interested in obtaining a VTS certification. Admission into our proposed BSVT program will require graduation from an AVMA- accredited associate -level veterinary technology program and a passing score on their national licensure exam (VTNE=Veterinary Technician National Exam), as well as a GPA of 2.5 on all college credit coursework. Once students are accepted into the program, they will have the ability to follow an asynchronous, self -paced plan, so they have the flexibility to continue working full or part-time within the profession. To develop a curriculum that will meet the previously discussed guidelines while also aligning content with program outcomes and building off our previously offered veterinary technician coursework, we established a curriculum that is spe cific to our college of veterinary medicine. It has quite a few differences versus the other three bachelor completion degrees currently offered online, which are more specific for technicians interested in getting their VTS or becoming a practice manager. Our program is built on the concept that a bachelor completion credential would be a professional advancement opportunity and should lead to better utilization by employers, higher compensation, improved job satisfaction, and improved veterinary technicia n retention. We put a large emphasis on teaching the science behind the clinical and nursing skills students will have learned in their associate -level program and prepared them for additional upward mobility within the veterinary community and elsewhere. Our curriculum has evolved since the original submission of the preproposal and includes some essential courses recommended in the VIC's report, distributed in June 2020. We also received helpful recommendations from the undergraduate curriculum committee when comparing our program to the nursing program, and they also suggested the addition of a leadership course. Therefore, we added both a course in leadership and communication and one in practice management to round out our core curriculum and aim to meet the needs of veterinary technicians that are currently practicing.

Any unique features such as interdepartmental cooperation: This program will be taught by members of all three academic departments within the College of Veterinary Medicine including Biomedical Sciences, Veterinary Patho biology, and Veterinary Medicine & Surgery as well as several adjunct instructors from the state of Missouri, and across the US. The College of Veterinary Medicine is excited for this interdepartmental collaboration which is noted in the letters of support from all three department chairs. 5.D. Program Goals and Ass essment Learning outcomes will be assessed utilizing a variety of modalities, which will be dependent upon the course and instructor. The required courses will have a minimum of three proctored objective -based examinations. Other assessments may include, but are not limited to case evaluations, recordings, formative assessments, group presentations, discussion boards, and more. All students in the BSVT program will have passed the Veterinary Technician National Exam (VTNE) before being accepted into the program. There is currently no additional certification or licensure/standardized exams for bachelor -level education in veterinary technology; however, this may be changing in the future. Typically, first-time, full -time undergraduate students who graduate within six years at the University of Missouri have a graduation rate of 68%. We anticipate a higher graduation rate of ~80% for our program due to the significant differences between the students accepted into th e BSVT program and a typical first-time freshman. OPEN - ASARED - 2-31 April 22, 2021 5.E. Student Preparation The BSVT target population is registered veterinary technicians. These potential students will need to have graduated from an AVMA-accredited associate -level veterinary technology program and completed all the AVMA-required technical skills (Appendix B). In addition to graduating from a veterinary technology program, these applicants must also have passed their national licensure exam, VTNE (Veterinary Technology National Exam), and therefore be credentialed to work in the profession. They must also have a GPA of 2.5 or higher on all college credit coursework. An articulation agreement between the UM system and prospective student's previous institution will have to be established to facilitate a proper transfer of associate -level credits to apply toward their baccalaureate degree. Therefore, each student's path to earning the BSVT may be slightly different, and articulation agreements between community colleges and the MU CVM will be established to streamline this process for students. An sample articulation agreement with Moberly Area Community College (MACC) has been included in the appendix. The University of Missouri is currently working on developing articulation agreements with associate -level veterinary technology programs at: 1. Moberly Area Community College in Mexico, MO 2. Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City, MO 3. Crowder College in Neosho, MO 4. Jefferson College in Hillsboro, MO 5. University of Arkansas at Beebe in Beebe, AR 6. Murray State University in Ardmore, OK 7. Northwest Community College in Norfolk, NE 8. Joliet Junior College in Joliet, IL 5.F. Faculty and Administration A BSVY director position will be finalized closer to the start of the 2021 fall semester. Cindy Cravens, DVM, is currently spearheading the program within the College. The director will need to have a vision for how the program can evolve to meet the needs of veterinary technicians over time. The director will commit approximately 0.8 FTE to the BSVT program. Due to the nature of CVM's existing high -quality, online -ready faculty members, the College anticipates that it will only need to hire three part -time adjunct instructors to cover the new course load. We do not plan to have additional requirements for instructors above the master's degree required by Mizzou's Office of eLearning for online undergraduate programs. However, we do plan to offer preference toward instructors that have knowledge of the veterinary medical profession and are either veterinarians or registered veterinary technicians who can refine their courses to keep them as clinically practical as possible . All DVM and RVT instructors are OPEN - ASARED - 2-32 April 22, 2021 required to keep up their continuing education hours needed for state licensure, which will ensure that they are staying up to date on clinically relevant information. 5.G. Alumni and Employer Survey Following graduation, we plan to send out surveys at one , three, and five years following graduation to evaluate success within the profession and determine what areas we can build-on, and what areas are the most successful. These surveys will most likely be sent in a virtual format, such as SurveyMonkey or Qualtrics, and we will offer positive reinforcement for feedback, such as being entered in a drawing for a prize. Having feedback about job satisfaction, skills utilization, and salary is important, but having our graduates give us specific feedback on comparison before and after graduation will be crucial for our program evaluation and future goal- setting. We aim for most graduates to return surveys, including satisfied to extremely satisfied with competencies developed in the program and their clinical relevance in veterinary practice and patient care. Although student and graduate satisfaction and success are our primary goals, we also want to elevate the patient care that can be offered in veterinary practices across America and improve the productivity of the veterinary medical team. For this reason, we also plan to survey employers of graduates to get their feedback on the opinions of employees' performance and productivity after graduation from our program. If practice owners can give us guidance on speci fic areas, we c an expand our program to include, that w ill also be essential data when considering new courses to add to the program. Good communication is also vital to ensure that these employers are utilizing our graduates to their full potential, which is critical for the well -being of employers, employees, and the practice. We suspect a majority of employers will be satisfied to extremely satisfied with graduate employee performance on proficiencies in advanced veterinary technology. 5.H. Program Accr editation Specific program accreditation is not necessary. The University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine is currently fully accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). The AVMA does have an accrediting body that evaluates associate -level and 4 -year veterinary technology programs, but they do not assess bachelor's completion programs. If the AASVB eventually develops a credentialing exam for bachelor -level technologists, then the CVTEA will then develop accrediting requirements that we will abide by. 1 OPEN - ASARED - 2-33 April 22, 2021 6. Letters of Support OPEN - ASARED - 2-34 April 22, 2021 OPEN - ASARED - 2-35 April 22, 2021 April 30, 2020 RE: Online Bachelor's Degree in Veterinary Technology Dear Dr. Wallace and Dr. Cravens: On behalf of the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine Academic and Student Affairs departments, I enthusiastically support the development of the online bachelor's degree in veterinary technology at the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine. The convenience of asynchronous online course work will make this program attractive to current veterinary technicians and allow them to continue to work within their profession while completing the degree. Providing this online opport unity to complete a bachelor's degree will allow veterinary technicians with an Associate of Applied Science degree the ability to expand their career opportunities, increase their marketable skills and contribute valuable leadership to their profession du e to this specific advanced training. I anticipate there will be a high level of interest in this opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in veterinary technology online. This effort by MU to respond to the growing need in the profession for technici ans with advanced training is to be applauded. Sincerely, Angela K.

Consensual Romantic Relationships: For purposes of this policy, consensual romantic relationships exist when two individuals mutually and consensually understand a relationship to be romantic, intimate and/or sexual in nature. Direct evaluative, whether casual or serious, short-term or long-term, past or present. A.2. Evaluative or Supervisory Authority: Evaluative or supervisory authority exists when one participant is personally involved in teaching, mentoring or advising, supervising, evaluating, assessing, grading, or otherwise determining the otheror making recommendations relating to another participant's conduct or academic or employment performance, progress or potential. B. Statement of Principles 1. The University of Missouri promotes an atmosphere of professionalism based on mutual trust and respect. The integrity of interaction among faculty, staff and students must not be compromised. 2. When individuals involved in a consensual romantic relationship are in positions of unequal power at the university, there is a potential for a conflict of interest, favoritism, or exploitation. 3. These relationships may be less voluntary than the person with greater power perceives, or circumstances may change and conduct that was once welcome may become unwelcome. B.4. The fact that a relationship was initially consensual does not insulate from a later claim of sexual harassment. Moreover, such relationships may lead to restricted opportunities, or the perception thereof, for others in the work or academic environment. 5. In cases in which a consensual romantic relationship does not violate the provisions outlined in Section C, faculty, staff and students should be sensitive to the continuous possibility that they may be placed in a position of responsibility for another member of the University community's evaluation and/or supervision in the future. C. Policies: In light of the foregoing, and to protect the integrity of the University academic and work environment, consensualthe University adopts the following policies with respect to consensual romantic relationships: 1. Consensual romantic relationships between members of the University community are prohibited when one participant has direct evaluative or supervisory authority over the other because such . Such prohibited relationships create an inherent conflict of interest, and may result in OPEN - ASARED - 3-4 April 22, 2021favoritism or exploitation. Examples of such include supervisory relationships that are prohibited include, but are not limited to, between an employee (faculty, staff or student)/) and a student and , as well as between a supervisor (faculty, staff or student)/) and a subordinate, when those relationships involve direct evaluative or supervisory authority. In such cases, the individual in the evaluative or supervisory position has an obligation to immediately disclose the consensual romantic relationship to the individual's administrative superior and to cooperate with the administrative superior in removing himself or herself from any such evaluative or supervisory activity in order to eliminate the existing or potential conflict of interest.. 2. Students or employees Consensual romantic relationships between any undergraduate student and faculty and staff are prohibited, except as described below in Section D.2. Consensual romantic relationships between undergraduate students and graduate students are permitted so long as it does not violate Section C.1. 3. These policies extend to previous relationships. All faculty, staff or students previously engaged in a consensual romantic relationship with another faculty member, staff member or student are prohibited from exercising evaluative or supervisory authority over said person. D. Exceptions and Reporting 1. Faculty, staff and students may request an exception, and each will be considered on a case-by-case basis. For an exception to be appropriate, there must be adequate assurance that (a) the student is protected from potential adverse effects on the learning environment and (b) that any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest are appropriately managed. 2. A request for an exception must be made to the appropriate dean, vice chancellor, vice president or similar level of leadership. 3. After consultation with the University's campus-level Chief Human Resources Officer or designee in the Human Resources Department, the appropriate dean, vice chancellor, vice president or similar level of leadership will determine whether the relationship violates the policy and, if so, if an exception is appropriate. If an exception is appropriate, a management plan will be implemented in consultation with Human Resources and the involved parties and should be provided in writing and acknowledged by the participating faculty and/or staff member(s). For employees, a record of the plan will be maintained in each employee 's' personnel file. 4. If an exception is denied, the consensual romantic relationship will be in violation of this policy unless it is discontinued. The relevant parties may seek review of the denial of the exception by submitting a written request to the Provost or designee within 5 days of being notified. For good cause, the Provost may grant reasonable extensions of time to seek review of the denial. The Provost or designee will approve, deny, or modify the exception. The determination of the Provost or designee is final and not subject to further review under University grievance procedures. If circumstances leading to the denial change, the relevant parties may submit another exception request. 5. Examples of situations in which an exception might be appropriate include but are not limited to: OPEN - ASARED - 3-5 April 22, 2021a. A consensual romantic relationship with an undergraduate student precedes the individual's status as a student at the University (e.g., a faculty or staff member and an undergraduate student have been in an established relationship [e.g., marriage], and the student subsequently enrolls as an undergraduate at the University); b. A consensual romantic relationship existed under the prior version of this rule that either did not require disclosure or was appropriately disclosed and managed, but upon the effective date of the revised rule, the consensual romantic relationship is prohibited. C.6. Faculty, staff and students who believe in good faith that a violation of the foregoing policy has occurred are encouraged to promptly report the violation to the University., which will promptly investigate and appropriately resolve all such reports. Students or employees who believe that such a violation has occurred may: 1. Report the perceived violation to an appropriate University official; 2.a. File a grievance, under the appropriate University grievance procedure; and/dean, vice chancellor, vice president or similar level of leadership; 3.b. In the event the reporting party believes some one has been discriminated against based uponon the one's individual's sex, file a report complaint with the appropriate Title IX Coordinator for the campus. D. The University will promptly investigate and appropriately resolve all such reports. E. A violation Violations E.1. Violations of this policy, defined as a failure to address the existing or potential conflict of interest, regardless of the manner in which it is brought to the attention of the University, may lead to disciplinary action as appropriate, up to and including termination of employment, following appropriate processes for such discipline.

Audit Performance The overall objective of our audit and compliance plans continues to be aligning strategically with a focus on high- risk areas and compliance gaps. Audit and compliance staff remain available to be redeployed for: Gap analysis Understanding workflow Assisting in re -engineering of processes Since the February 2021 meeting of the Audit Committee, Internal Audit completed two consulting engagements and four investigations. 43% 21%36%FY2021 Audit Plan Status Not Started In Process Completed April 22 , 2021 OPEN - ACE - INFO 1 -2 Consulting Engagements System - COVID-19 Relief and GEERS Funds Compliance Support In collaboration with the system controller's office, developed and provided compliance guidance for the CFR and GEERs funding. MUH Revenue Cycle Process Cash Reconciliation Process As part of the MU Healthcare implementation of the Cerner Registration and Scheduling system, the process University Physicians uses to track and reconcile payments received from patients in the outpatient clinics required modification. The Office of Ethics, Compliance and Audit Services evaluated the controls around the new process. The control design for the future process was sufficient. As with any new process it would be prudent to re -evaluate these controls and the process in general, after a period of operation. This will allow detection and correction for any unanticipated shortcomings.

April 22 , 2021 OPEN - ACE - INFO 1 -3 Management Action Plan Status as of February 28, 2021 Follow- up procedures are performed twice a year to verify the status of management actions for previously issued audit reports. For this time period, forty -two (42) action items were due for completion by February 28, 2021. The Management Action Plan Summary Table lists audits with open action items. At least one action plan for the highlighted audit reports was due during the time period August 1, 2020 - February 28, 2021. Sixteen (16) action items were completed, and 25 were extended and assigned revised due dates. All but one extension was necessary due to the COVID- 19 public health emergency and the subsequent impact on business operations. One action item associated with the One Card Audit will not be implemented, due to pandemic-related budget and FTE cuts. MU Lab Saf ety - High Risk The risks identified in this audit create the potential for significant impacts to the university, including endangering faculty and student safety, external compliance violations and adverse publicity. Improved collaboration between stakeholder groups is required to address the current control gaps which limit the effectiveness of the lab safety program. The actions are dependent on the development and approval of the new policies, which are delayed due to the pandemic impact on business and academic operations at the university. All items are in process with policy approval expected by Fall 2021. Policy approval will facilitate the implementation of new procedures, training, and establishment of a safety oversight committee . Completion of all action items is expected January 2022. MU Health Controlled Substance Diversion Prevention - High Risk Drug diversion is an inherently high- risk area for healthcare. O rganizations face serious financial, regulatory, legal and reputational risks resulting from healthcare worker diversion and inadequate controls. The Controlled Substance Diversion Prevention action plan focused on advancing and maturing existing diversion prevention activities at t he health system . Work on incomplete action items has been suspended or is currently unable to be verified due to pandemic restrictions in clinical areas, or budget restrictions resulting from the pandemic response. The r emaining work that will have the most impact on the effectiveness of a drug diversion program, includes: The purchase and implementation of diversion detection software Formal training and additional resources for the drug diversion technician The need to prioritize the pandemic and vaccination response will continue to be a factor in achieving the remaining outstanding items . An agreed to completion date of January 2022 has been established. April 22 , 2021 OPEN - ACE - INFO 1 -4 UMS External Student -Funded Accounts - Medium Risk The External Student -Funded Accounts action plan focused on protecting the university from fraud risks associated with student -funded accounts held in external bank s that have faculty or staff signers/advisors. The university has no authority over these accounts and therefore, cannot monitor them. To reduce risk to the university, student organizations were r eclassified into risk and relationship tiers and new implementation standards established . Annual training for faculty/staff advisors to thes e medium to high- risk student organizations and the requirement to sign agreements outlining their responsibilities , has been delayed because all resources in the Office of Student Affairs were focused on supporting the safe re -entry of students for the Fa ll 2020 semester . A new due date will be determined once the public health emergency has subsided and more normal operations have resumed, likely in the Fall 2021 semester. UMS One Card Process - Medium Risk The action plan for the One Card Process audit centered on efforts to improve oversight and coordination between Supply Chain and Accounts Payable Shared Services for improved monitoring, analysis, training, and reducing the time for expense report approval. Process changes and collaboration across key functions have resulted in oversight improvements without the addition of analytics tools. Expense report and transaction approval and reconciliation timeframes have been reduced, sanctions and suspensions for non-compliance have been implemented, and methods for improved management and/or elimination of inactive cards are being carried out. Three action plans are in process with expected completion by December 2021. MU Health Revenue- Generating Physician Contracts - Low Risk The action plan for the Revenue -Generating Physician Contracts audit centered on ensuring the physician services and hours being provided were consistent with expectations in the agreements, and that billing was supported by time records. These actions we re limited to four agreements in two clinical departments at the School of Medicine. Two action items were met through analysis and amendment of contract terms. A third action item, which involved implementation of a consistent method for recording provider time in support of monthly billing in one department, could not be verified. The matter has been referred to the Office of Corporate Compliance and Office of General Counsel, which are working with the affected department and School of Medicine to addr ess the issue. UMSL Lab Safety - Low Risk The action items due for the UMSL Lab Safety audit were directed at ensuring lab safety practices were consistent with and supported by policy and procedures, including the development of additional specific safety policies, acknowledgement of the safety plan, and hazard training. Three of six action items were due this reporting period; one was completed and two were extended. New safety policy was developed, and a procedure for acknowledging the safety plan was completed, but in- person training has been delayed until it is safe for larger groups to gather once the public health emergency subsides, likely in the Fall 2021 semester.
