With classic design, luxurious materials, and the latest technology as our inspiration, we constantly explore new ways to transform spaces with light, always with our century-long promise at heart: to make lighting that lives forever. Our finest crystal offering in cut, color, and clarity, Radiance by Schonbek is engineered brilliance. Characterized by optical purity and prism, each gem has nearly triple the number of jewel-cut facets over mass produced crystals, and delivers a kaleidoscope fire that dances and dazzles. European crystal hand-cut by craftsman using centuries-old techniques, Heritage Handcut\u00ae Crystal is created in two stages. First cut on iron and sandstone wheels a single facet at a time, then, polished with marble dust on a wooden wheel. Each jewel created is an authentic antique replica of gems that adorned the castles of the Habsburg Empire. Modern advancements in the manufacture of optics used in telescopes have ushered in a new generation of crystal. Created to enhance internal light refraction, the Optic Crystal used in Schonbek luminaires catapults new designs into the future. Harder and more durable than crystal, Optic Haze Quartz has the same composition and prismatic qualities as naturally occurring quartz crystal. Using a novel process for making consistently high-grade gemstones full of depth and character, Schonbek Optic Haze Quartz exhibits the fine characteristics of mined quartz crystals, and are similarly refined by gem cutters. On a Schonbek, they captivate with elegance. Radiance Crystal Dust is composed of tiny jewel-cut facets each sized, shaped and polished to shimmering perfection. Fabricated in Europe at the premier source for lead-free crystal, thousands of these brilliant gems embellish our lighting designs, casting luminous beams that dance and dazzle. Timelessly representing nature's artistic signature in every gemstone, Schonbek Quartz Crystal is sustainably mined. Care is first taken to hand select stones with unique fissures and veining. From there, skilled gem cutters cut, grind, and polish each rock crystal to enhance its natural splendor, luminosity and dazzling prismatic beauty. A Schonbek dressed in Quartz Crystal celebrates unaltered natural beauty. Created in a myriad of colors, effects, shapes, and sizes, Swarovski\u00ae Crystals are free of flaws, unique in purity and brilliance, and sharply faceted for optimal light refraction. The crystals are machine cut and polished to achieve perfect clarity, then treated with an invisible coating making them easier to clean. Swarovski Crystals are only available on specific Schonbek luminaires. Swarovski is a registered trademark of Swarovski Aktiengesellschaft Join Stock Company, unaffiliated with Schonbek. Our Custom designs are symbolic of the Schonbek heritage: creating bespoke crystal Schonbeks of the highest heirloom quality. Each is a radiant masterpiece of elegance and opulence, drawing inspiration from its rich European ancestry and longstanding chandelier-making tradition. "}
