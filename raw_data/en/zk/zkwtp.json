The biggest change for 2023 was made to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, with bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines recommended by the FDA in children aged 6 months to 4 years. This includes a single booster dose in these children at least 2 months after completing primary vaccination. Otherwise, the same guidelines from 2022 apply - New York state law requires all students entering school grades kindergarten through 12 to be vaccinated, or to have a valid medical waiver, for the following: - Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Booster (DTap for kindergartners, TdaP when the child turns 10) - (IPV or OPV) - Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) A and B - Varicella (Chickenpox) - Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) - Pneumococcal (Prevnar) The standard meningitis vaccine is recommended for children at age 11, with a second meningitis vaccine at the age of 16. An additional dose of MenB meningococcal vaccine is recommended at age 16, as that strain is more prevalent in college outbreaks and residential settings, such as U.S. basic military training centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recommends: - Children get the HPV vaccine to protect against the human papillomavirus. The latest data allows children to begin receiving the vaccine as early as age nine, with two doses providing the necessary protection under age 15. Three doses will be necessary if the child begins receiving the vaccine after the age of 15. It is important to remember: - Vaccines are safer and more effective today than ever before. One reason is the naturally occurring additives that help sterilize vaccine fluids. - While children today are getting more vaccinations than in the past, the overall amount of immunologic agents in these vaccines is smaller. Two shots given to children in 1980 had more immunologic agents than the antigens in the entire childhood vaccination series given today. - Delaying vaccinations \u2014 or spreading them out over time \u2014 increases the risk of exposing your child to a serious and possibly life-altering illness. - Vaccines don't weaken the immune system; they boost it. Parents should discuss vaccine updates with their child's pediatrician at every annual well child visit, as the recommendations from the AAP change annually.
