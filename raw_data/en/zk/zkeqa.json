At the refurbished Spa at [Mandarin Oriental](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/london/hyde-park/luxury-spa)\u2014a world of utter serenity\u2014the Nescens Better-Ageing Face Massage draws on scientific expertise from the Centre for the Prevention of Ageing at the Clinique de Genolier in Switzerland to deliver a magically relaxing and rejuvenating treatment\u2014starting with a welcome cup of pepper, ginger and cinnamon-infused tea and time unwinding in the glorious Vitality pool. Thoroughly primed for treatment, you are then led to a treatment room for an 80-minute epidermal exercise programme which uses manual and mechanical lifting techniques to stimulate circulation and effective facial drainage, activating collagen and elastin production. You won't want to leave, but when you do reclaim your shoes and coat, you waft out with radiant, firm, thoroughly revived skin. Facial at Katherine Jackson Escape the world for a while to the safety and comfort of [Katherine Jackson's](http://katherinejackson.co.uk/) haven, tucked away in Imperial Wharf. With 37 years of experience in the beauty industry, Jackson has extensive knowledge of alternative therapies, including the ancient healing arts of Ayurveda, Shiatsu and reflexology. Her bespoke facial does exactly what is says on the tin. Not only does she mix and match complementary therapies into your treatment, completely tailoring it to you; she also quite literally mixes the cleansers, serums and masks for you during the treatment depending on your skin needs, getting you the best results possible. The whole experience is luxurious and wholesome, ensuring you float all the way home, and more importantly do so with a glowing and refreshed complexion. Spa/Clinic by 111 Skin at the Bulgari Hotel The underground spa at the [Bulgari hotel](https://www.bulgarihotels.com/dam/jcr:83e3f9e3-b323-468a-9c2a-78ee7be62cac/bvlgari-spa-london-treatments-1.9.pdf) is sprawled over two floors, and boasts a 25 metre pool, a slick Workshop gym, a sauna, stream-room and ice shower. It is also home to a menu of treatments by 111 Skin, the brand founded by a Harley Street cosmetic surgeon. If you're in the market for a super-charged glow, go for the Celestial Black Diamond Facial, which involves a technical ten-step treatment (and thankfully some soothing massage too). And, whilst you're there, try out the Cryo Energy Cellulite treatment, which uses freezing blasts from an intimidating-looking machine to simulate micro circulation and tone your legs and stomach. Massage at The Corinthia The [ESPA Life spa](https://www.espalifeatcorinthia.com) at the Corinthia hotel is a serious affair. Spread over multiple floors, the cavernous space contains a warren of plunge pools and jacuzzi beds fitted with startlingly strong water jets. It also holds a curving corridor lined with therapy rooms. Book into one of them for a deep-tissue massage. The 90 minute experience starts with an assesement of your aches and pains (Do you sit at a computer? Yes! Do you carry a heavy bag? Yes!). As soon as you climb onto the bed those aches and pains start to dissipate. The daily grind of hunching over a screen and carting a bag to work crumbles into mere memory as a therapist kneads knots and stretches crunchy muscles. Once your back has been ironed back into its natural shape, round the experience off by kicking back in the grand chill-out area with a magazine in hand and a cup of herbal tea. Pure Face Therapy at Beata Aleksandrowicz [Beata Aleksandrowicz](https://www.beata.website/) founded her company Pure Massage in 2002 as a service both to train other professionals in the art of massage therapy and for her own client list. Operating out of a flat in Ladbroke Grove, Aleksandrowicz has a signature treatment called Face Therapy, a six treatment holistic course aimed at bringing light and energy to clients' faces. This is done through a consultation where Aleksandrowicz finds out more about your general wellness (sleep, health and stress) to see what other factors need to be considered besides muscle massage. Then, she sets to work without any product, simply massaging the facial muscles to awaken them and relieve tension. Over the course of the six sessions, she works deeper on certain areas to get lasting results and gives clients exercises to work on at home. Diamond Cocoon facial at Natura Biss\u00e9 Cult Spanish skincare brand [Natura Biss\u00e9](https://www.naturabisse.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-NaturaBisse_UK-Site/en_GB/Stores-Details?StoreID=1443) has opened its first London standalone spa in The Village, Westfield. Once through the beechwood lobby area you'll be escorted to a spacious treatment room infused with 99% pure oxygen air. The Diamond Cocoon facial is the spa's most active, using their range of acids and peels to achieve a glassy skin look by sloughing through the pollution and dirt to reveal a bright new layer of perfect skin. After a peruvic and lactic acid mask is removed (a very tingly part of the treatment), you can relax into the heated bed and drift off as the facialist massages, plumps and perfects skin with toners and moisturisers to finish the process. Deep Tissue Massage at The Refinery [The Refinery](http://therefinerye9.com) is an underground sanctuary beneath the bustle of Hackney. Hunt it down, and seek out Amy Moffat for an indulgent hour of self-love and wellness. The deep tissue massage she offers is an outcome-oriented treatment that works wonders on reducing muscular tension and eradicating stress levels. After an hour of having all the tension pummeled from your tired muscles, you'll never look back. Custom Rejuvenating Facial with David Peters A practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine, [David Peters](http://www.davidpeterslondon.com) is currently in residence at the Bvlagri Spa where he has created a range of treatments that combine the best of traditional medicine with western innovations, notably for his unique facial. The bespoke treatment begins with traditional Chinese massage followed by the unique combination of LED Light Therapy and acupuncture encouraging collagen production to plump the skin and cellular renewal to clear blemishes. The treatment finishes with a Tui-Na massage, facial cupping and sculpting to firm, tone and smooth fine lines and leaves the face feeling revitalized, full and dewy. Abhyanga Massage at Jivita Ayurveda Residents of Kensal Rise are well-versed in the benefits of an Ayurvedic massage, thanks to the popularity of [Jivita Ayurveda](https://jivitaayurveda.com/) on Chamberlayne Road. In the front, it's a health food shop, but further back are a few treatment rooms\u2014the idea is that the one space can offer everything needed for an Ayurvedic lifestyle. The name means \"knowledge\" and \"vitality for life\" in Sanskrit; the team at Jivita Ayurveda have a lot of the former, and, once you've had your whole body massaged, from scalp and face to toes, you'll leave beaming with the latter. Facial with Su-Man Operating out of the Away Spa in the W hotel, super-facialist and ex-dancer [Su-Man](https://www.su-man.com/facials/) fuses shiatsu and traditional Chinese Medicine to re-sculpt your face (or at least, that's what it feels and looks like). Soothing tension from the chest, shoulders, ears and arms with a firm, deft massage technique, she then applies the same ethos to your visage, kneading your neck, nose, cheeks and forehead to release toxins, boost circulation, and drain blockages. The massage, combined with exfoliation, extraction, and a tingling mask, has an astonishing affect: you'll head home with plump rather than puffy skin, razor-sharp cheekbones, and heightened energy, too. Como Shambhala Massage at Como Shambhala Urban Escape Como are renowned worldwide for their hotels and spas\u2014temples to the art of relaxation and meditation. Lucky Londoners can now head to their [Shambhala Urban Escape](https://www.comohotels.com/en/metropolitanlondon/wellness) in the Como Metropolitan London. The signature massage, named after the spa itself, is stellar in every way. Start with a warm foot soak in heady aromatic water, and pick the oil you want from your massage (healing, relaxing or restorative, for example). The most intriguing thing about the massage technique is that it flows all over your body, rather than a traditional massage which works each of the four quarters of your body one by one. You'll be hooked in an instant, not only to the world-class massage, but also the ginger tea at reception. Aromatherapy Associates WE Relax massage Step in from the pavement on Piccadilly Circus through the doors of [Akasha spa](https://www.hotelcaferoyal.com/spaandtreatments) at the Caf\u00e9 Royal and you experience an immediate tension-lifting contrast in mood, from frenetic street life to utter tranquillity. It gets even better. In a mood-lit subterranean treatment room, the therapist asks you to choose between two Aromatherapy Associates oil blends (Deep or Light Relax), and there follows 60 minutes of a magically calm, grounding and de-knotting massage of your back, scalp, face, neck and shoulders. You are left in a state of deep mellowness and you don't float out until your therapist has also given you some useful mindfulness tips. Bliss. Massage at Ushvani Day Spa When you get that feeling of being cooped up in the city for too long, head to the cavernous [Ushvani Day Spa](https://www.ushvani.com/treatments/massage-treatments/). Amongst the red-brick architecture of Cadogan Gardens, it's astonishingly vast, opening out and out into a spa pool and steam room, a peaceful yoga studio and the Asmara suite (a dedicated couples room). Mahogany and marble reign throughout, the main feature being the sprawling, opulent staircase. It's not all about the surroundings, though: the treatment list is brilliant. A ninety-minute massage under the magical hands of one of their delightful therapists followed by a cup of detoxing herbal tea ensures you will float out of the door feeling soothed, supple and serene. Massage at Radio Hair Salon [Radio](http://www.radiohairsalon.com) started as a salon, but set up a side-operation as a spa at the request of its clients. Their most popular treatments are massages\u2014and it's not difficult to see why. Shepherded to a small-side room upon arrival at their King's Cross outpost, it quickly becomes clear that a massage here isn't about the space, but the spirituality of the experience. Strokes are slow and languid, and deeply relaxing. The only downside is that, after falling into a deep sleep, the treatment finished far too fast. Massage at St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel If you don't think St. Pancras is an obvious haven of calm, head into its grand, gothic hotel, get the lift to the lower floor, and prepare to be surprised. Found in the former steam kitchens, the spa feels utterly disconnected from the tumult of the platforms above. After a swim in the pool and a session in the Asian-themed relaxation room, head into an equally soothing [Ultimate Aromatherapy massage](https://www.stpancraslondon.com/en/spa/). The therapist will offer you a selection of fragrant oils to suit you mood, and, after tucking you under a blanket, spend the subsequent hour kneading them into tense muscles. Facial at Aesop, Lamb Conduit street Located on the delightful Lamb's Conduit Street, [Aesop's thirty-five-minute facial](https://www.aesop.com/uk/r/facial-appointments) might be speedy, but it does the trick. After a pre-treatment skin consultation, you are whisked onto a divan, cocooned in blankets, and allowed to do absolutely nothing for the next half hour. A mask is mixed in a basin at the back of the room, and a hand massage administered whilst it works its magic. With ingredients such as Damask rose and chamomile, your skin is left feeling nourished and purified, with no harsh chemicals in sight. James Harknett Spray Tan at the W Hotel It's a reassuring thought, as you shiver in a black plastic booth, naked except for a hairnet and pair of paper pants, that you're about to be bronzed by the [Tom Ford](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/tom-ford-new-york-fashion-week) of spray tanning. James Harknett certainly lives up to his accolade. Operating out of the pleasantly swanky spa at the top of the W hotel, the walls of his studio are plastered with pictures of glowing celebrity clients, and everything he uses, from the products to the aforementioned paper pants, are top-quality. Even if you don't leave looking like Kylie or David Gandy (that's just genetics), you'll certainly walk away with a durable, streak-free tan that is painstakingly suited to your skin tone. Facial at Pfeffer Sal Found in a stable block at the end of a mews in Fitzrovia, [Pfeffer Sal](http://pfeffersal.com/gently-does-it/) has replaced straw with specially cleansed air, charcoal-saturated water and sleek interiors. You are unwittingly detoxified after filling in your initial introduction form, but the real action starts after you've clambered into an alluringly heated bed in the treatment room. The [Gently Does It](http://pfeffersal.com/gently-does-it/) facial is the place to start, with a combination of probiotic masks, facial massage and extraction as well as a curious (but seemingly effective) sound-bath session, during which sound waves push products into the skin. Try and get out of bed again. It will be exceptionally difficult. Haircut at Salon64 Ricky Walters set up shop in Soho after he saw a gap in the market. There wasn't a single salon, he says, where you can actually enjoy yourself. So, while he offers the cuts, dyes and dries, he has made [Salon64](http://www.salon64.co.uk/) into a social space\u2014soon to become even more social when they start serving alcohol. Clients can pop in to have a coffee, get ready for a night out at the vanity stations, or, if you want total privacy, hire a hidden room at the back of the basement. Massage at the Rosewood London If you've only frequented the perennially packed bar at the Rosewood London, you might not be able to imagine the hotel as a haven of relaxation. Head down to the [Sense Spa](https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/london/wellness), though, and you'll find yourself proved wrong. Step gingerly over wooden walkways to a softly lit treatment room, and settle down for a massage: the therapists are experts are de-knotting tight shoulders and releasing toxins left over from previous stints at the bar upstairs. Acupuncture facial at John Tsagaris Spending an hour lying horizontally with 60 needles sticking vertically out of your face might not sound like the obvious route to relaxation. Actually, once you've eased into feeling like a metallically reinforced porcupine, it's relatively soothing\u2014although according to acupuncture guru [Tsagaris](https://johntsagaris.co.uk/), full relaxation isn't the aim: no small pinpricks of pain, he says, no gain. The theory behind his facials is that the needles puncturing the skin stimulate its natural healing properties, reducing inflammation and encouraging elasticity. The results are pretty immediate. Don't believe us? Ask the celebrities who regularly get the full Tsagaris treatment before stepping out onto the red carpet. Indulgent Hammam Ritual at the Moroccan Spa, Urban Retreat, Harrods \"Transformative\" is an overused word in the world of wellbeing, but an understatement when applied to the heavenly marocMaroc [Indulgent Hammam experience](https://urbanretreat.co.uk/services/the-moroccan-spa/about-the-moroccan-spa)\u2014a traditional steam, scrub and massage ritual that is performed attentively within a heated marble enclave to clear body and mind. After acclimatizing in the warm room, your Kessala leads you to a marble room for the application of black soap to soften your skin, followed by a full body exfoliation with kessa glove, face exfoliation, scalp massage, hair washing ritual and traditional stretching. Each detail takes you further down the route towards profound relaxation: the warmth, the second exfoliation with the deliciously scented Miel d'Ambre, the bowl of oil you're given to apply before a 50-minute massage. It's a truly indulgent treatment lasting three hours, not including your post-treatment refreshment of Moroccan mint tea, dried fruit and nuts. Reflexology at Margaret Dabbs [Margaret Dabbs](https://www.margaretdabbs.co.uk/) may be known for medical pedicures, but it's her reflexology treatment that's set to be the hottest appointment for 2018. Head down to her spa zone in Space NK's enormous Westbourne Grove store, where an expert will work on your feet to relieve tension all over. One treatment is enough to get anyone hooked, but it's likely you'll go back regularly. Bespoke facial at Sarah Chapman [Sarah Chapman](http://www.sarahchapman.net/) is usually booked out, but if you do manage to get hold of an appointment, you'll understand why. A team of therapists use a range of Environ and own-brand products to tailor-make every facial, down to each and every pore. An in-depth consultation is followed by a session of skin-focused wizardry, comprising sonic waves, LED lights and micro-needles. Facial at John Bell & Croyden Right at the back of John Bell & Croyden's palace of pharmaceuticals, you'll find a soothing treatment room where facialist Maria works her magic. Starting with a conversation about her aims, she chooses from an array of products including Dermologica, Pai and Natura Biss\u00e9 to boost your radiance levels. Couple skin-soothing solutions with arm, hand and neck massages to ease away any tension and you'll leave an hour later with better, brighter skin. Reiki at the Akasha Holistic Wellbeing Centre, Hotel Caf\u00e9 Royal If a day spent around Piccadilly has ground you down, book into a Reiki treatment at [Akasha Spa](https://www.hotelcaferoyal.com/spaandtreatments), which uses crystals and essential oils to rebalance any off-kilter chakras. In addition, the Reiki master will also let you know which parts of your body you need to focus on, and remind you of the best ways to take care of yourself. After an hour, you'll leave feeling elevated, and educated too. Pedicure at DryBy Bar Getting your nails done at DryBy is like getting your nails done in a living room that is tidier than yours will ever be. The sticky black chairs of the normal salon are no-where to be seen; instead, you recline in light pink armchairs soak your toes in large golden bowls. If that doesn't tempt you, the treatment itself is always perfect. Massage at the Mondrian A massage at the [Mondrian](https://www.morganshotelgroup.com/mondrian/mondrian-london)'s Agua Bathhouse & Spa is a delightfully bespoke experience, with oils blended to match your mood. If you want to relax, that can be arranged, and aided post treatment in the relaxation room. If you'd rather feel invigorated, tell your therapist, and make sure you grab a cocktail at the hotel bar on the way out. Sound Massage at The Mandrake Hotel What is a sound massage, you ask, skeptically. Well, imagine lying still whilst ringing gongs and singing bowls vibrate around you. Still unconvinced? What if you knew you'd sit up with a mind so calm, you'll feel you've spent the week meditating on a beach in Thailand? If you sense you might be a possible convert, head down to [The Mandrake](http://www.themandrake.com/spiritual-wellbeing-treatments.html) hotel where Slav, the in-house wellness guru, uses musical instruments to create a composition of harmonic sounds that penetrate your body to help to heal emotional and physical trauma. All this, whilst images of space are projected on a big screen in front of you. You'll feel as if you've transcended to another world. [Hari's](https://harissalon.com/) Hairdresser Hari Salem cut his teeth with Twiggy's stylist, Leonard, before opening his first salon over 30 years ago on the Brompton Road. Now, with four branches across West London, his empire has become something of an institution, but that doesn't mean he's afraid to innovate\u2014in 2007, news broke that he regularly coated client Catherine Zeta Jones's (very glossy) hair in beluga caviar. His latest Fulham Road outpost combines high-tech amenities (personalized iPad programmes and digital magazines) with a botany-inspired philosophy that focuses more on plants and less on fish. The newly-launched \"Herb House for Hair\" programme offers an array of plant-based colour boosters and herbal treatments. We recommend the Lotus Leaf glossing mask, traditionally used by Persian women to cleanse and strengthen hair, which combines copper, iron and protein to boost gloss and volume. [Perfect 10 Black Label](https://www.perfect10mobilebeauty.co.uk/pages/black-label) If you (like a lot of us) are the type to realize you have a party on a Friday night, and then desperately (and unsuccessfully) scrabble to find an appointment for a wax/pedicure/blow-dry on a Friday afternoon, then Perfect 10's Black Label might well be your saviour. A 24-hour mobile beauty service that comes to your home, office, or wherever you make your desperate call, therapists are available round the clock, offering everything from pop-up spray-tanning booths, to personal training, to decompressing massages. [Natura Biss\u00e9 Facial at The Grove Hotel](https://www.thegrove.co.uk/spa/treatments/#new-high-definition-face-lift) According to cult Spanish skincare brand Natura Biss\u00e9, it only takes an hour to get visibly brighter, tighter skin\u2014with no needles in sight. Their botox-free answer for those looking for a little extra bounce comes in the form of their Inhibit Lift Facial, offered at The Grove Hotel. The three-step treatment begins with a tingly deep peel to help fight skin pigmentation and tackle the ageing effects of city pollution and stress, and ends with a deep facial massage and hyaluronic mask. Don't be surprised if you fall asleep and wake up, as if by magic, with a "}
