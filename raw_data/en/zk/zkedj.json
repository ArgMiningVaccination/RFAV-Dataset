Working to save lives. They work diligently every day, without fail, to develop new treatments, to find cures, and to support patients and their families through illness and into recovery. Everyone ever touched by UW Medical Center knows this \u2014 and so does U.S. News & World Report. The publication has ranked UW Medical Center the number one hospital in the state for five consecutive years. Number one for five years running. That's a statistic forged out of hard work, dedication and compassion. To see UW Medical Center's other local and national rankings, go to uwmedicine.org/usnews.WINTER 2017 / 3Your Campaign On October 21, 2016, the University of Washington launched the public phase of its most ambitious philanthropic Campaign to date. By 2020, the University plans to raise $5 billion. With our portion of the Campaign, called Accelerate: The Campaign for UW Medicine, we expect to raise $2 billion of that total to advance work in patient care, medical education and research. Thanks to you, we are already more than halfway to that goal. Many of you \u2014 our advocates, our alumni, our faculty and staff \u2014 have already made generous contributions over the past few years to advance human health. Thank you. And because this is your Campaign, too, we are dedicating this issue of UW Medicine magazine to the groundbreaking work you support. You will see a story on the University's Population Health Initiative, a sweeping, 25-year project that involves everyone at the University of Washington. Together, we will advance health and well-being by improving human health, environmental resiliency, and social and economic equity here and around the world. As you might expect, UW Medicine's work is central to this initiative \u2014 as is our Campaign. In this issue, we highlight stories about our Campaign priorities, from protein design to student scholarships, and from cancer care to stem cell regeneration. These priorities \u2014 the work that you support so generously \u2014 represent the future of medicine. UW Medicine exists for one reason: to improve the health of the public. We envision a world in which no one suffers from Alzheimer's disease or diabetes. In which cancer stops being a death sentence. In which we can disrupt the paths of many diseases by manipulating genes or creating new proteins. Accelerate: The Campaign for UW Medicine will bring all of us everywhere closer to treatments and cures and bridge the distance between illness and a better, healthier tomorrow. Please take a moment to learn more about the Campaign in the following pages, or visit AccelerateMed.org. And please know that you have our deepest thanks for your continued support. Together, we can shorten the distance between sickness and health and create healthier lives for everyone, everywhere. Sincerely, Paul G.

Since joining the Alumni Leadership Council, I have welcomed first-year students at the Stethoscope Ceremony. I have presented new white coats \u2014 adorned with our medical school's crest \u2014 to second-year students. I have participated in the Capstone Program, preparing fourth-year students for internships. I have hosted students in my home for dinner to discuss their interests and careers. And I have connected with alumni of all ages at a variety of events, from reunions to board meetings. From our days in school to our years as alumni, our relationship with UW Medicine is made up of moments that, when woven together, create our lifelong bond with the School and with our classmates and fellow alumni. Last June's Reunion Weekend contained a number of those incredibly memorable moments. Over the course of two days, I reconnected with my own classmates, mingled with alumni from other classes and congratulated recipients of our distinguished alumni awards. What struck me during the weekend is how meaningful our connection with the School is, whether you graduated 15 years ago (as in my case) or more than 50 years ago. Another highlight of my first year as president has been the recruitment of new members to the Alumni Leadership Council. There are many alumni who want to make a difference in the lives of our students and our graduates, and it has been rewarding to connect those interested in getting more involved with fitting opportunities. With that, I invite you to get involved. You can contribute regardless of where you live. Add your name to our list of alumni mentors, and let us share your contact information with students who would like to hear about your career. Open your home to students who are traveling to your area for residency interviews. Consider hosting a clerkship. Join your class reunion committee, and enjoy the thrill of connecting with classmates you have not been in touch with for years. Learn about Accelerate: The Campaign for UW Medicine, and consider supporting an area of UW Medicine that is meaningful to you. Participating in any of these opportunities will leave you feeling fulfilled \u2014 and proud of your affiliation with the UW School of Medicine. Sincerely, Scott R. Stuart, M.D. '01, Res.

VALUES Advocacy CollaborationCommunication Diversity ExcellenceGenerosityInclusivity Innovation MentorshipServiceMESSAGES WINTER 2017 / 5AROUND UW MEDICINE: NEWS RESEARCH Study details how Zika damages fetal brain For the first time, an interdisciplinary team studying the Zika virus has documented how it affects fetal brain development. The team, led by UW Medicine researchers Kristina Adams Waldorf, M.D., Res. '02 (OB/GYN), Michael Gale, Jr., Ph.D., and Lakshmi Rajagopal, Ph.D., used primate models to show how the virus crossed from the mother through the placenta and into the fetal brain. Once there, the virus stopped the growth of white matter, im - portant to coordinating communication among different parts of the brain. The results of the study, published in Sep - tember 2016 in Nature Medicine, could bring the team closer to developing a therapy or vaccine that can neutralize the virus and prevent fetal brain injury. Brain treatment lowers blood sugar in diabetic rodents UW Medicine researchers demonstrated that a single injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 delivered into the brains of diabetic mice and rats can normalize blood sugar levels. Michael Schwartz, M.D., Res. '86 (internal medicine), UW professor of medicine in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutri - tion and the Robert H. Williams Chair in Medicine, led the multi-institutional study, which was published in Nature Medicine. The treatment successfully lowered blood sugar levels for at least four months in rodents with mild forms of diabetes, and it did not lower blood sugar levels in those without diabetes. This research contributes to evidence that the brain strongly influences sig - nals throughout the body that control blood glucose levels, and it opens up possibilities for new therapeutic targets. Teen drinking alters dopamine signaling and leads to risky behavior Led by Jeremy Clark, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Psy - chiatry and Behavioral Sciences, UW Medicine researchers discovered that adolescent drinking alters dopamine, a chemical neurotransmitter that helps control the brain's reward and motiva - tional centers, which leads to long-term impaired decision-making. Rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence were consistently more inclined to take the high-risk, high-reward option as adults. Researchers also demonstrated that these changes in brain chemistry can be reversed using a receptor inhibi - tor to normalize dopamine signaling and restore normal circuit function. Results were published in The Journal of Neuroscience.Repeat stretches of DNA tied to cancer progres- sion and survival Short, unstable stretches of DNA, called microsatellites, may play a significant role in the development of cancer. Stephen Salipante, Ph.D. '09 (genome sciences), M.D. '11, Res. '14 (pathology), UW assistant professor in the Depart - ment of Laboratory Medicine and lead author of this study, collaborated with scientists from across departments to analyze gene sequences from 18 dif - ferent kinds of cancer. Microsatellites are made up of repetitive sequences of DNA and are prone to mutations. Depending on the location of these mu - tations, researchers think they could be causing malfunctions in genes respon - sible for the development and progres - sion of cancer. This research, published in Nature Medicine, also has the poten - tial to uncover new cancer genes. 6 / UW MEDICINEAROUND UW MEDICINE: NEWS PATIENT CARE UW Medicine receives high hospital rankings UW Medical Center earned U.S. News & World Report's No. 1 ranking for care in Washington state and in the Seattle metro area in summer 2016. It is the fifth consecutive year that UW Medical Center has achieved that dual distinc - tion. The news magazine published its 2016-2017 national, state and local rankings of \"Best Hospitals\" across the United States, part of its evaluation of nearly 5,000 facilities. UW Medical Center received top-20 national rank - ings in four specialties: rehabilitation medicine (No. 4; the program is jointly located at Harborview Medical Center); cancer (No. 7, provided jointly with Seattle Cancer Care Alliance); ear, nose and throat (No. 16); and geriatrics (No. 20). All of UW Medicine's hospitals \u2014 UW Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, Northwest Hospital & Medical Center and Valley Medical Center \u2014 were also recognized as high-performing in one or more areas. The region's first adult intestine transplant Jorge Reyes, M.D., UW professor of surgery and the Roger K. Giesecke Distinguished Chair in Transplant Surgery (pictured), and a team at UW Medical Center became the first in the Pacific Northwest to transplant an intestine into an adult patient. Twenty-six-year-old Savanah Oberts suffered from a congenital condition that caused part of her bowel to twist and lose its blood supply. To save her life, a portion of her bowel was removed, but that surgery brought new challenges. For five years, while she waited for a trans - plant, Oberts could not eat, and the intravenous nourishment she received led to liver failure. In August 2016, she received a donor intestine and liver. Although Oberts was the first adult in the region to receive an intestinal transplant, seven others, all children 10 or younger, have undergone the procedure. Reyes was their surgeon. Giving primary-care clinics a technological upgrade Healthcare innovation has typically concentrated on blockbuster drugs or powerful new equipment \u2014 not on how to improve the delivery of primary care. Yet primary-care clinics play an enormous role in healthcare. The UW Primary Care Innovations Lab was launched last year to bring leading-edge technology into the primary-care set - ting. By fostering collaboration between practitioners and entrepreneurs, the lab can figure out what doctors want and what will make a difference in providing patient care. The lab draws upon researchers and clinicians from more than 50 clinics across the WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Mon - tana and Idaho) region's Practice and Research Network. EDUCATION Two hundred students graduate and become physicians On May 27, 2016, 200 students received an M.D. from the UW School of Medicine. Among the graduates, 129 are from Washington state, 17 from Wyoming, 19 from Alaska, 20 from Montana and 17 from Idaho. The 2016 graduating class chose Doug Paauw, M.D., Res. '88, Chief Res. '89 (internal medicine), MACP, UW professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and the Rathmann Family Foundation Endowed Chair in Patient-centered Clinical Education, to be the speaker. Paauw, a highly regarded educator, reminded gradu - ates, \"The most important education you have received, though, is how you think, how you organize information, with both your brain and your heart \u2014 how you will care, truly care \u2014 about your patients.\" #1 Hospital in the State Since 2012 ALSO NATIONALLY RANKED WINTER 2017 / 7Record number of UW medical students enroll in Idaho and Spokane, Wash. This academic year, the UW School of Medicine and the University of Idaho welcomed the largest-ever entering class of medical students. Forty first-year UW School of Medicine students, including six Targeted Rural Underserved Track (TRUST) students, have begun their medical training on the University of Idaho campus. \"Growing our medical program to provide more Idaho students with access to a top-ranked medical education is a priority for our university, one that addresses a critical need for physicians in our state,\" says Chuck Staben, University of Idaho president. Additionally, the UW School of Medicine and Gonzaga University also welcomed the largest-ever entering class of medical students in Spokane, Wash., totaling 60 people. \"Out-of- body\" training boosts heart surgery residents' skills Watching and assisting with patient procedures has been the standard method for teaching surgical residents. However, the results of a study published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery indicate that simulation may be a better way to teach surgical skills. UW Medicine cardiothoracic surgeon Nahush Mokadam, M.D., Res. '07 (cardiothoracic surgery), the holder of the Lester and Connie LeRoss Endowed Professorship in Cardiovas - cular Surgery (pictured), and his peers at seven U.S. academic medical centers developed a simulation curriculum and evaluated its benefits to surgical residents. The study involved a rigorous 39-session course with training mod - ules for three common cardiothoracic surgeries and three adverse events. The results of the study indicate the simula - tion course not only improved trainees' technical proficiency but also their decision-making and communications skills. Ultimately, the goal of simulation is enhanced patient safety. Mokadam is a core faculty member at WISH (the WWAMI Institute for Simulation in Healthcare at UW Medicine), a national leader in using simulation to improve the quality of healthcare education, patient safety and outcomes.AROUND UW MEDICINE: NEWS Want more news? information on your health? \u00bb healthlibrary.uwmedicine.org an A to Z guide on medical conditions uwmedicine.org/healthworks tips and videos uwmedicinepulse.com podcasts WWAMI Service-minded student family Huffstetler Rowan, MPH (center-right, above), a fourth-year student at the UW School of Medicine and a recent graduate of the UW School of Public Health, is one of five U.S. recipients of a scholarship to pursue the specialty of family medicine.

WINTER 2017 / 9 KEEPING PEOPLE ALIVE AND WELL IS A RACE AGAINST TIME: a shot to ward off the flu, for instance; surgery to fix a faulty heart; chemotherapy to prevent cancer's spread. And at UW Medicine, we're on the fast track to winning this race, so that deadly and chronic illnesses become more treatable, even curable. Accelerate: The Campaign for UW Medicine is a multi-year effort to raise $2 billion to shorten the distance to healthier lives \u2014 for everyone, everywhere. On the pages that follow, we've profiled a few of the brilliant people working on our Campaign priorities, from mental health to global health, and from stem cell regeneration to protein design. Join us on the fast track \u2014 be part of our acceleration. WINTER 2017 / 9 ON THE FAST TRACK TO A HEAL THIER WORLD10 / UW MEDICINE CREATING PROTEINS TO FIGHT DISEASE AT THE MOLECULAR LEVELTamuka Chidyausiku's dream of being a scientist began with his father's oversized blue coat. His father bleached it white, to resemble a lab coat, and placed it on his son's shoulders. That budding scientist is now a Ph.D. candidate in biochemistry, learning how to create proteins from scratch at the UW Medicine-based Institute for Protein Design (IPD). Proteins are the dynamos of the human body \u2014 they digest food, fight infection and move muscles, among many other processes. However, when proteins malfunction, they become a source of disease. At the IPD, researchers like Chidyausiku are attempting to engineer new proteins to improve human health. David Baker, Ph.D., is the IPD's director. \"For every scientific field, there's some time in history when it advances really rapidly,\" says Baker. \"That's the stage we're at now with protein design.\" Recent innovations at the IPD include new proteins that block influenza infection, deliver chemotherapy agents directly to tumors, treat autoimmune diseases and protect against vi - ruses. Designer proteins also hold promise as diagnostic tools, an area Baker feels could be integral to population health. \"We're exploring how to create affordable, easy-to-use sensors that can detect vitamin deficiencies and the presence of viruses like Zika,\" says Baker. Protein design's potential applications extend into other fields, like the environment. For example, Chidyausiku hopes to design proteins that break down toxic pesticides in the soil. To achieve this goal, he must first understand how proteins fold \u2014 how they take on a particular shape to fulfill a function. \"The Baker lab does this work better than anyone else in the world. Coming to the UW was a no-brainer,\" he says. Baker's mentorship has been crucial to Chidyausiku's success. \"He's not only interested in my projects, but my career, too. I'm really lucky to have him,\" says Chidyausiku.

Howell is president and CEO of the Washington Research Foundation (WRF), and in 2014, the WRF made a generous gift that enabled the recruitment of new fellows at the Institute for Protein Design (IPD). \"The institute is so avant-garde,\" says Howell. \"We wanted to accelerate their progress by bringing in people with new skills and perspectives to collabo - rate.\" Working within other University of Washington departments and Seattle-area research institutions, the fellows use protein design to tackle problems related to human health and the environment. Fellow Franziska Seeger, Ph.D. (pictured), is work - ing with Mohamed Oukka, Ph.D., a UW associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics based at Seattle Children's, to create novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. \"The goal is to make treatment more readily available and cheaper to deliver, particularly for children in the developing world,\" says Seeger. Nearly two years into her fellowship, Seeger feels inspired. \"I'm surrounded by intelligent, driven people. This is the most collaborative environment I have ever experienced,\" she says. David Baker, Ph.D., director of the IPD, shares her inspiration, and he reflects a moment on the founda - tion's generosity. \"Their gift is enabling discoveries in a number of areas, such as diabetes and cell-based therapies for cancer,\" he says. \"The impact of the research is truly amazing.\" 12 / UW MEDICINE DEVELOPING TREATMENTS AND CURES \u2014 ESPECIALLY FOR CANCER \u2014 THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO EACH PATIENT \"Historically, cancer has found a way around everything we've thrown at it,\" says Jay Shendure, M.D., Ph.D., UW professor in the Department of Genome Sciences and affiliate investigator at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. But recent, remarkable advances, including the invention of powerful technologies for sequencing and analyzing cancer genomes, are converging to create new opportunities to beat cancer. Namely, they're converging to create precision medi - cine: using a person's specific biology to determine the most effective treatment for cancer and other ailments. To Shendure, the epicenter for precision medicine is in Seattle. \"In terms of biomedical research, in terms of dollars received from the National Institutes for Health, and in terms of the caliber of new discoveries \u2014 we are leading the world in precision medicine research,\" he says. In Seattle, world-class institutions in biomedical research and care \u2014 UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle Children's \u2014 exist in close proximity and in close collaboration. \"We all have a tremendous amount of respect for each other,\" Shendure says. \"It's reflected by the fact that leadership at all three institutions solidly stands behind a shared vision.\"He also sees the potential in further collaboration, perhaps bringing researchers together even more closely to advance immunotherapy and gene-sequencing technology. \"We want to build bridges in specific ways to address specific projects \u2014 to do things that would be impossible as individual labs or institu - tions,\" says Shendure. Precision medicine has already benefited a handful of cancer patients, and vaccine development at UW Medicine is showing great promise in preventing cancer relapse. The benefits of the research are clear. The ultimate goal, however, is to accelerate access for the greatest number of patients possible \u2014 and to make cancer a curable disease, rather than a deadly one. \"Eliminating cancer is a battle that will be won over many decades, playing out in our children's and our grandchildren's lifetimes,\" says Shendure. \"But Shendure, M.D., Ph.D., UW professor of genome sciences, stands in a room full of gene sequencers, equipment key to the practice of precision medicine.

In the last few years, that dynamic has evolved. There is a growing synergy between research advances in areas such as disease modeling, biomarkers and genomic medicine, and all of them affect the clinic experience. In my Huntington clinic, for instance, we now discuss clinical trials aimed at inhibiting the disease-causing gene. I see patients with familial Alzheimer's disease who are enrolled in ongoing studies investigating the use of antibodies in the removal of the amyloid peptide. We are actively engaging families in valuable longitudinal studies and interventions which hold potential as disease-modifying therapies. We couldn't do that five years ago. And we can't lose sight of the larger goal, which is to be prepared to bring therapies to the broader community.

Far too many Rwandan children were dying as infants, and there weren't enough skilled neonatologists in the country to help. Since training new neonatologists would take too long, they decided to use health aid dollars and in-kind donations to install incubators in rural clinics. And they trained existing personnel in a few skills that would help keep babies alive for those first, critical weeks of life. It worked. Government reports indicate that neonatal mortality rates are falling. Facilitating good, informed decisions: that's what the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study was designed to do. Coordi - nated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the GBD brings together enormous amounts of data from around the world and, to make sense of it, taps the expertise of nearly 2,000 collaborators in about 130 nations. The result is the best, most complete analysis of global and local health trends available, which IHME shares with people responsible for health policy and spending. It's a powerful tool for address - ing health problems and fiscal accountability, and it's one of the cornerstones of the University of Washington's Population Health Initiative. \"The GBD is now the largest scientific collaboration publishing today,\" says Bill Heisel, IHME's director of global engagement. \"The work is massive in scope with a clear mission: create a world where everyone has a chance to live a long life in full health.\" Tina Fitzmaurice, M.D., MPH, Fel. '15, a hematologist- oncologist at Harborview Medical Center, is one of dozens of researchers who conduct data analysis for IHME. She came on board in 2014. \"One huge benefit of the GBD is that you're able to put a single disease or disease group, like cancer, into context,\" she says. For instance, findings from the GBD collaboration show that cancer is the second leading global cause of death after cardiovascular disease. In contrast, when you look at what the study terms \"years lived with disability,\" meaning any time spent in less than optimal health, things like mental and substance abuse disorders rise to the top, along with musculoskeletal disorders and diabetes. Cancer falls in the rankings to No. 14. Given her public health background, Fitzmaurice feels for - tunate to see individual patients and to conduct research that benefits entire populations. She particularly appreciates the intense, caring ethos at IHME \u2014 her colleagues want to make sure leaders are making effective investments in the health of their countries. \"Everyone here is very driven,\" she says. \"Not to advance their own careers, but to actually produce good estimates that improve global health.\" 14 / UW MEDICINE Part of the team at IHME: William Msemburi, Ph.D. candidate and research assistant, Nikhila Kalra, Ph.D., policy translation specialist, and Chu-Wei Yuan, Ph.D., simulations and forecasting researcher.

Regenerative medicine is made possible by rapid advances in our understanding of the biology of stem cells, which have the capability to form all the tissues of the body. With these advances come tools capable of treating \u2014 and possibly cur - ing \u2014 some of the world's most common causes of death and disability: chronic diseases, such as heart disease, Parkinson's, diabetes and Alzheimer's. Many people who suffer from chronic diseases have missing or damaged cell populations: dead heart tissue, for instance, that cannot repair itself. That's where stem cells \u2014 which allow researchers to create living tissue \u2014 come in. Eventually, researchers hope to be able to use stem cell tech - nology to create, then transplant, healthy new cardiac muscle cells or engineered 3-D tissue. It's a prospect that inspires Murry's work in regenerating heart muscle. \"We can get at the root cause of these chronic diseases instead of just treating symptoms,\" he says. Today, using stem cells to grow tissue is also proving ben - eficial in developing personalized therapies for illnesses like cancer or genetic diseases. Using high-throughput processing, scientists can screen hundreds of FDA-approved drugs and experimental compounds against stem cell-created tissues, or human cancer cells, to find the best treatment for each person. \"The ability to test huge numbers of drugs quickly, multiple times, and in relevant human systems is a real game-changer,\" says Murry. In all this research, collaboration is key to success, notes Kaytlyn Gerbin, a graduate research assistant in the Murry lab. \"There's a diverse group of scientists, engineers, clinicians and students, all working toward a common goal,\" she says. That goal? Saving lives. Murry agrees, adding, \"People here like to work together on complex science \u2014 and to work on things that are bigger than themselves.\" Kaytlyn Gerbin (left), a graduate student in the Murry Lab, en - joys collaborating with her colleagues, including Chuck Murry, M.D., Ph.D., and Becky Zaunbrecher, pictured.

Bill Rex has also been involved with UW Medicine in an entirely different way: as a patient. In 1997, he was treated for colon cancer and a broken blood vessel at UW Medical Center; in 2016, he had an emergency surgery at Northwest Hospital & Medical Center. He spent 40 days afterward in the hospital, being nursed back to health after double pneumonia set in. Inspired by Bill's care, and by his long-standing volunteer leadership with Northwest Hospital's board, the Rexes made a planned gift to Northwest Hospital & Medical Center: the largest one ever made to the institution. It was a different set of circumstances, however, that inspired the Rexes' planned gift to the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Not long ago, Bill and other UW Medicine Board members paid a visit to doctors helping veterans with psychiatric problems at UW Medical Center's Roosevelt Clinic. Bill was deeply moved. \"They're helping people who saved our country,\" he says. Bill was an investment banker for his entire career, and when the Rexes decided to create a charitable remainder trust to make their planned gifts, they knew it was a solid choice. But they also enjoy knowing that their gifts will continue their legacy of service. \"There's great satisfaction in knowing we're helping people for years to come,\" says Bill.

He's referring to the gift that his fam - ily foundation, the John H. Tietze Foundation Trust, made to UW Medicine in 2006. Approximately 10 years and more than 20 awards later, Larry and his wife, Eileen, continue to support junior researchers focused on stem cell research \u2014 and the return on investment is awe-inspiring. Many award recipients have leveraged the Tietzes' investment to secure millions of dollars in grants to further their work. Early funding, like the kind the Tietze family provides, gives junior researchers a chance to explore big ideas \u2014 high-risk, high-reward projects that accelerate medicine. \"The Tietze Award addresses a critical funding niche for promising research ideas or projects not served by traditional National Institutes of Health funding mechanisms, and it also serves as a catalyst for the overall success of a developing laboratory,\" says 2010 Tietze Award recipient Robert Rostomily, M.D., Res. '92 (neurological surgery). Inspired by the success of the Tietze Awards, which have allowed break - throughs important to human health and spurred further investment, Larry and Eileen established a charitable remainder trust for UW Medicine. They know their planned gift will leverage progress at UW Medicine. \"We could not be more excited about the return on investment,\" says Larry. \"You don't have to be a billionaire to make a big difference to life-saving science.\"18 / UW MEDICINE EDUCATING THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DRIVE THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE \"I wouldn't be where I am today without mentorship.

He assem - bled an executive team: men and women of different ethnicities, hailing from five countries. Thanks to the team's rich blend of ideas and perspectives, the company began to flourish, with an annual cash flow of $500 million per year. The lesson stuck with Ames, even after his tenure as CEO. \"When I retired, I really wanted to cultivate diversity in higher education \u2014 improve the pipeline for diverse leaders in a variety of fields,\" he says. Ames and his wife, Barbara, established the Ames Family Foundation to fund minority student scholarships at universities in the Pacific Northwest. In 2001, the Ames family set up a fund to honor Angela P\u00e1ez, a student at the UW School of Medicine who had died in an avalanche. \"Her dedication to help - ing underrepresented students pursue careers in medicine perfectly matched what we were trying to do,\" says Ames. \"It's vital to produce doctors who reflect the diversity of the WWAMI region.\" Inspired by a generous matching challenge gift from the dedicated donors of the Huckabay family, Ames and his wife created the Angela P\u00e1ez-Paul G.

And when leaders at the University of Washington were considering how best to focus the energies of a great university, they decided to make population health the center of the most expansive, visionary plan in the University's 155-year history. \"We believe we have a moral imperative to improve the health and well-being of people here in Washington and around the world,\" says UW President Ana Mari Cauce. \"Together with partners across the University, region and globe, we will find solutions to the world's greatest health challenges, improving the health of our planet and of all the people who call it home.\" THIS BOLD VISION is embodied in the University's new Population Health Initiative, which aims to help everyone, everywhere, lead a healthy life. Accelerating Population Health 20 / UW MEDICINEWINTER 2017 / 21 WHAT WILL THE POPULATION HEALTH INITIATIVE DO? Over the next quarter-century, the Population Health Initiative will expand the UW's ability to create actionable policies, reforms, interventions and innovations in: Reducing diseases and health disparities locally and globally; Addressing environmental sustainability, particularly in communities most likely to be harmed by climate change; and Creating greater social and economic equity. WINTER 2017 / 2122 / UW MEDICINE ACCELERATING POPULATION HEALTH Ali H. Mokdad, Ph.D., UW professor of global health at the UW Medicine-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), notes that population health is a strong focus in many areas at the UW: social work, arts and sciences, built environments, law, business and many others. And, of course, at UW Medicine and the School of Public Health, and in the department they jointly administer: the Department of Global Health. \"The UW is already doing stellar work in the population health arena,\" says Mokdad, the vice chair of the president's new Population Health Initiative Executive Council. \"This initiative and the University's fundraising campaign offer us the opportunity to work together in a focused, united way \u2014 so that everyone has the chance for a boundless future.\" The human condition The first thing that executive council members like Mokdad stress is that popula - tion health is a broad topic, including human health and major health determinants such as social and economic equity and environ - mental resilience. In short, with this 25-year-long initiative, the University of Washington intends to take on and improve the human condition. The University is meeting this challenge with enormous capacity in data collection and analysis, which will frame problems and assess solutions. It's addressing it with unparalleled experience in working with underserved populations and in rural and urban areas. And it's approaching population health with the reputation \u2014 and resources \u2014 associated with being one of the best research universities in the country, one with a wealth of expertise in areas that range from environmental science, to the humanities, to medicine. Paul G. Ramsey, M.D., the CEO of UW Medicine, knows that his colleagues are eager to address the new challenges posed by the president's bold initiative. After all, the mission of UW Medicine is to improve the health of the public. \"Very few places have the scale or the commitment to discovery that UW Medicine has,\" he says. \"We want to make sure that everyone \u2014 faculty, staff and students \u2014 can contribute to this initiative to their fullest ability.\" Data and real-world solutions IHME, administratively based in UW Medicine, has been working on popu - lation health since its founding in 2007. Seattle-based investigators collaborate with hundreds of researchers worldwide to collect and assess data on trends in human health at the regional, state and community levels. One of the results is the world's most comprehensive analysis of health data: the Global Burden of Disease report. This study, updated annually, is the work of 2,000 collaborators in approximately 130 nations, and its findings are being used by policymakers in countries around the world.

Photo: Clare McLeanWINTER 2017 / 23ACCELERATING POPULATION HEALTH India, Rwanda and China, for instance, are allocating health funding and addressing issues ranging from child mortality to pollution. And the data can reveal some surprising connections. \"At the national level, one country can look quite different from another,\" says health economist and IHME Director Christopher J.L. Murray, M.D., D.Phil. \"But once you start looking locally, you find counties in the U.S., for example, that share characteristics with areas around the world.\" Meaning: a population health intervention that works in one region may also work half - way around the globe, or right here in our own backyard. Murray and his colleagues already regularly provide findings and analysis to UW Medicine, to the School of Public Health, to Pres. Cauce and to the UW's Office of Global Affairs. And they're looking forward to engaging more partners once the Population Health Initiative comes fully online. \"IHME is at the ready to provide scientific data and analytical insights on a range of topics, from diseases, to injury, to education levels, to income levels,\" says Murray. \"We're here to help drive real-world solutions.\"Everything we do When Emiko Tajima, Ph.D., thinks about population health in the Seattle area, she thinks about people who have nowhere to live. According to a count conducted by the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homeless - ness in 2015, approximately 10,000 people in the King County area were homeless, either in shelters or on the streets. \"If we want to be serious about popula - tion health outcomes locally, addressing the housing situation and economic stability is really critical,\" says Tajima, an associate pro- fessor in the UW School of Social Work. The school is addressing these and other topics, in part, through student education. \"We do the best we can to recruit stu - dents from within the communities we want to serve,\" says Tajima. And the school does not limit itself to local service. For instance, associate professor Tracy Harachi, Ph.D., helped Cambodian students establish that country's first undergraduate degree in social work. \"In some ways,\" says Tajima, \"everything we do relates to population health.\" The same holds true for faculty in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the UW School of Medicine. Innovations that work in one part of the world can work in others.

Brown24 / UW MEDICINEACCELERATING POPULATION HEALTH \"IHME estimates that mental disorders account for about 23 percent of all health-related disability worldwide, much more than diabetes, heart disease or cancer,\" says J\u00fcrgen Un\u00fctzer, M.D., MPH, the department's chair. And, like Tajima, Un\u00fctzer and his colleagues are doing something about it. Last year, the department established a new Division of Population Health, whose faculty collaborate with scientists in medi - cine, public health, social work, global health and the graduate school to improve the mental health of populations worldwide. Locally, they're collaborating with the School of Social Work to train providers in suicide prevention and improve training for people who work with foster children, with the School of Education to improve school-based mental health services, and with Computer Science & Engineering to use technology to reach more people with effective mental health care. Collaboration within the University of Washington is one of the department's strengths, notes Un\u00fctzer. And external collaboration is equally important. \"Locally and in our five-state region, we partner with communities and community- based healthcare providers \u2014 and we also partner with low- and middle-income countries around the world,\" says Un\u00fctzer. \"In fact, much of what I've learned about effective care comes from watching people in low-resource settings, where many people need care, but where there are few spe - cialists. They have to find smart, creative, human solutions that make the most of the resources they have.\" Population health is all about this kind of human capital and connection. \"If the Population Health Initiative helps drive great - er collaboration so that we can benefit from all the strengths of the University, we could do a lot more good together,\" says Un\u00fctzer. More than we can imagine \"I think about cities a lot,\" says Thaisa Way, Ph.D., UW professor of landscape architecture and landscape historian in the College of Built Environments. They can be dangerous places, magnets for inequity, ill - ness and pollution; bad for human and envi - ronmental health. Way, however, is quick to point out the flip side. \"If we plan cities right,\" says Way, \"we can have an incredibly positive and productive impact.\" Way is the director of a group called Urban@UW, which aims to make Seattle a model city, one that is a healthy, opportu - nity-filled place for all its residents. Other members of the faculty at the College of Built Environments also pursue population health projects: Ben Spencer, M.A., MLA, for instance, works with the Department of Global Health and communities in Peru and Cambodia to design shared public spaces. Another faculty member, Branden Born, Ph.D., studies food security. \"We think about how place impacts human and environmental health in really broad ways,\" says Way. Even so, she thinks that the Population Health Initiative will open the door wider, bringing together new com - binations of academics, policymakers and the public to take on intractable, intertwined issues such as poverty, climate change and political upheaval. \"We have an amazing capacity to think differently if we let ourselves,\" says Way. \"I think we might do things we never imagined we could do.\" All aboard \"I see the Population Health Initiative as an expansion of the University's existing role,\" Paul Ramsey says. \"It takes the terrific work already being done by the Department of Global Health and the School of Public Health, by IHME and by other practitioners, and broadens it to include our entire community.\" For Wasserheit in global health, the Population Health Initiative feels like the next evolutionary phase for a department founded a decade ago. Looking at the big picture. Working with communities. Realizing that the local informs the global, and the global informs the local. Knowing that a public university has a responsibility to its community and feeling the deep moral imperative that the University of Washington can and should give something to the world. \"This initiative really frames an opportunity for all of us,\" says Wasserheit. \"It's time for everyone to get on board.\" A PASSION FOR EQUITY Who should become involved in the Population Health Initiative? Judy Wasserheit, M.D., MPH (pictured), the chair of the Department of Global Health, has a ready answer. \"Global health and population health are magnets for people who are passionate about making the world a better place,\" she says. Wasserheit sees this quality on display time and time again at the UW, most recently in a collaborative research project undertaken by faculty in OB/GYN, global health, and computer science and engineering. In it, a group of pregnant women and new mothers in Kenya received tailored, encouraging SMS mes - sages from their caregivers and were able to text back questions and concerns. This communica - tion allowed the women to keep in much better touch with their health providers, and it improved breast-feeding practices and earlier use of post-partum contra - ception, both of which improved infant health. Students from Computer Science & Engineering helped create the platform, notes Wasserheit; global health stu - dents helped assess the impact. \"The outcome was pretty stun - ning,\" she says. \"Cell phones can help improve infant outcomes.\" The ethos behind this project, says Wasserheit, is the same one that drives the entire Population Health Initiative. \"We envision a world in which there is equity with respect to health and quality of life,\" she says.WINTER 2017 / 25 In late October 2016, the Population Health Initiative at the University of Washington received a transformative gift, one that will ad - vance the UW's efforts to improve health and well-being around the world, from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \"We are grateful and honored to receive this generous support from the Gates Foundation, which recognizes that the UW is among a small subset of institutions equipped to tackle the health challenges we face on a global scale,\" said President Ana Mari Cauce about this $210 million gift for a new facility. The 25-year Population Health Initiative, announced by Cauce last May, is designed to improve human health, environmental resilience, and social and economic equity here in our region and around the world. \"This is a transformational gift,\" says Paul G. Ramsey, CEO of UW Medicine. \"And it's being directed to an initiative that is a perfect fit for the mission of UW Medicine. It's a tremendous vote of confidence in the University's and UW Medicine's work to improve population health.\" This contribution is the third substantial investment the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has made to population health. The first two gifts were made a decade ago, when the founda - tion created the Department of Global Health, a collaboration between UW Medicine and the School of Public Health. It also founded the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a world leader in researching and analyzing global health trends to help policymakers make informed decisions on health interventions and government spending. Both groups bring scientific rigor, a deep belief in social justice and a broad network of global collaborators to their work. With this investment from the Gates Foundation, the University of Washington will construct a building that will house the Department of Global Health, IHME and portions of the School of Public Health, as well serving as a hub for faculty and student collaboration across a range of disciplines \u2014 from medicine and the health sciences to education, engineering, environmental sciences, law, the arts, humanities, social sciences, business and beyond. \"This gift will help set the path for population health at UW Medicine and the University of Washington, and guide us in making life better for everyone, everywhere,\" says Ramsey. \"It is a great moment for human health.\" Learn more about the Population Health Initiative at washington.edu/populationhealth \u00bbA Great Moment for Population Health HEALTHY PLANET, HEALTHY PEOPLE People and planet are interconnected. That's the central tenet of environmen - tal sustainability and resil - ience, and one of the tenets of the new initiative. LuAnne Thompson, Ph.D. (pictured), UW professor in the School of Oceanography (part of the College of the Environment), points out one of the most significant challenges to sustainability and resilience: climate change. \"Sustainability is going to be hard if we have constant climate change,\" she says. \"We've got to get ahead of it to keep both the planet healthy and people healthy.\" Thompson's work focuses on how the ocean exchanges heat with the atmosphere \u2014 how the Gulf Stream affects the weather, for instance, or how climate patterns like El Ni\u00f1o form. Such patterns are intimately involved with major issues in sustainability, such as drought, coastal erosion and food security. The prospect of working on the Population Health Initiative \u2014 to work with people interested in finding new solutions \u2014 is exciting to Thompson. \"All the faculty here at UW are trying to make the world a better place,\" she says.

This specially fitted RV is part of the clinic's homeless outreach program. Sandon worked in these tight quarters last summer under the guidance of her family practice preceptor, TJ Byrne, PA-C. Together, they followed a published schedule of stops in Coeur d'Alene and neighboring Post Falls. \"We take the mobile unit to the homeless. We go where people gather, such as the shelters, soup kitchens and food banks, and they come on for all of their medical needs, essentially,\" says Sandon. The mobile unit can handle minor procedures, including casting, splint - ing and excision of lesions. But Sandon notes that not all the care is physical. \"A lot of what we provide involves some social work, or some psych care,\" Sandon says. \"Some people just want somebody to listen to them without judgement.\" Patients may also find some food, water or basic over-the-counter medications on the mobile unit. \"They're so appreciative and polite and thankful,\" she says. \"You know, they don't really have anything, and what little we could give them makes their day. I really like what Heritage does for the homeless. We treat everybody with respect, and they give that back to us.\" Byrne, formerly teaching faculty at the MEDEX Spokane site, is in charge of Homeless Outreach for Heritage Health in Coeur d'Alene. Some days, this in - volves driving the mobile unit. On some scheduled afternoons, though, Byrne and Sandon practice street medicine. They leave the RV behind, load medical supplies into a backpack, and walk to where the homeless or nearly homeless are camped out. \"TJ knows where people are staying, or if they can't get out to us,\" she says. \"A lot of them are living in a motel room or RV, and we go to them and take care of their needs. They are really a com - munity \u2014 many of them give us tips about someone they know who isn't doing well, and we seek them out and find out if they'll accept our help.\" HEAL THCARE FROM THE HEART Sandon enjoyed her training with Byrne, a marked change of pace from her previous medical experience. \"My background is primarily in the operat - ing room,\" she says. For 13 years, she worked at a Coeur d'Alene hospital, the last seven as a surgical first assist. As Sandon looks ahead to her future as a physician assistant, she considers all of her deep connections in the Coeur d'Alene area. \"My heart is really in sur - gery, so right now I'm primarily looking into those specialties,\" she says. \"That said, if I could have the op - portunity to work alongside TJ every day, I would do it in a heartbeat,\" says Sandon. \"He is the epitome of health - care from the heart.\" Read the full story at depts.washington.edu/medex/ magazine \u00bb Search under \"clinical experience.\" MEDEX NORTHWEST Providing street medicine was part of the learning experience for Kira Sandon, PA-C (Spokane Class 18), pictured here with her mentor, TJ Byrne, PA-C.

For first-year medical student Elizabeth Richards, the ceremony felt like validation. \"Receiving the stethoscope instilled a sense of confidence that I belong here, and that I am in the right place to pursue my passions,\" she says. The stethoscope ceremonies also instill a sense of community among a diverse student body that hails from all five WWAMI states and beyond. This year, 65 students come from disadvantaged backgrounds, 57 students come from rural communities, and all 270 of them share a common objective \u2014 to one day improve the health of the public. \"It is so humbling and encouraging to be in the presence of people filled with the same passions as myself,\" says Richards. \"I am truly honored to be part of such an amazing class!\" ALUMNI PRESENTERS Our thanks to the alumni volunteers who presented stethoscopes on behalf of the alumni association.

I did most of my training back East and was looking for a way to reconnect with the School. When I ran into Scott Stuart, our alumni asso - ciation president, I couldn't pass up the opportunity! What are your first impressions? It's really exciting to hear about how the School is redefining the delivery of medical education. I'd love to go back to medical school with the current integrated curriculum (and that's something I never thought I would say!). Tell us a little bit about your career. I completed general training in OB/GYN and then a three-year fellowship in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. Mostly, I take care of female urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, but I also manage the continuum of female pelvic floor disorders. I was lucky enough to get to move home to Seattle in 2011 to begin practice at Virginia Mason Medical Center. Where's your favorite place to travel? I love adventure travel, strolling in Europe or having a great beach vacation. Every year, I also take a trip with a team from my fellowship to perform fistula surgery in Rwanda. That is always the most rewarding trip of the year.MEET OUR NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS This is the latest in an occasional series of introductions to the newest members of the UW School of Medicine Alumni Leadership Council. Want to learn more about the council? Please contact us at medalum@uw.edu. Sheida Aalami, M.D. '15 Tell us about your family. I live with my partner, Brad, and I am lucky to have the rest of my family nearby. My parents live in Phin - ney Ridge, and my sister lives in North Seattle with her husband and new baby. Why did you decide to join the council? I've been at UW since 2007. This university has given me so much over the years that I figured it was time to give back. How have you stayed involved with the School since your time as a student? Not a lot of time has passed since I was a student (I graduated in 2015), but I have tried to stay involved through joining the alumni council. I also look forward to working with and teaching medical students throughout residency. Where's your favorite place to travel? My favorite place to travel is Italy. The people, the culture, the history, the food: it can't be beaten! 32 / UW MEDICINE ALUMNI AND STUDENT UPDATES CELEBRATING YOU & YOUR CLASSMATES: REUNION WEEKEND 2017 REUNION WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FRIDAY, JUNE 2 Kick off the weekend at a Toast to the UW School of Medicine, an all-classes celebration at the Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI) on the shore of Lake Union. SATURDAY, JUNE 3 Get caught up on the latest School of Medicine happenings at UW Medicine Today, then gather in the evening with classmates to reunite and reminisce at your class celebration. More details will be available in the coming months. Watch your mailbox and your inbox for more information, and visit uwmedalumni.org/reunion.\"I was surprised by how easy and fun it was to call classmates I had known 40 years ago. The reunion gave me an excuse to call and ask how they were doing. I know I wouldn't have come to previous reunions without the effort of a classmate, so it really works!\" SUZANNE SPENCER, M.D. '76\"I was a bit hesitant to serve as a reunion committee member, worried that I wouldn't have time, or the responsibility would be too great, or that I lived too far away. But working with the other committee members made it easy to split the duties \u2014 and it turned out the work was really enjoyable! It was great fun to connect with classmates, some of whom I hadn't been in touch with since gradua - tion day. I highly recommend it.\" HELENA PASIEKA, M.D. '06\"It was very personally gratifying to attend and be involved in the process of helping to bring our class together. Over the years, as we all got so busy establishing our practices and living our lives, it was easy to lose touch. I had forgotten how much these individuals enriched my life during my years of schooling. Participating in the reunion committee and attending the weekend helped me remember and revisit some of those amazing memories.\" MITRA EHSAN, M.D. '96 LEND A HELPING HAND Reunions are most successful when members of the class are involved. While the alumni office manages the details, the work done by our reunion volunteers really makes Reunion Week - end possible. We've seen that the best way to get a good turnout is for alumni to reach out to their classmates. After all, the most memorable part of any re - union is the people you reconnect with! But don't take our word for it. See what some of last year's reunion committee members had to say about their experience. If you're interested in joining your reunion committee, please contact the alumni office at medalum@ uw.edu or 206.685.1875. Each spring, several hundred alumni return to the UW School of Medicine to reunite with classmates and learn about UW Medicine today.

I have used my medical background to come alongside the many folks here who are struggling with aging. Dementia is common. I have started a support group for partners of people having great difficulty dealing with their situations. It is so good to see how they help each other. I visit our hospital almost every day. I am grateful for this life, and I am grateful for the medical school which helps so many to have fruitful lives.\" FINDING KINDRED SPIRITS FROM THE PAST Grace Holmes, M.D. '57 \"If I had been the right age, would I have enlisted?\" This was the question that Grace Holmes, M.D. '57, pondered as she was writing her book: North Dakota Nurses Over There, 1917-1919. The book chronicles the experiences of female nurses who cared for the sick and injured during World War I. \"It was not an easy life for these women,\" says Holmes. \"They had so little to work with in the way of medicines. It took enormous courage to enlist and then follow through on that commitment.\" While Holmes remains uncertain about whether she would have enlisted as a nurse, she clearly shares the nurses' courage and dedication. Holmes, one of three women to graduate from her class at the UW School of Medicine, spent several years abroad as a medical missionary, serving rural populations in Malaysia and helping to build a hospital in Tanzania. When she returned to the United States, Holmes joined the faculty at the University of Kansas Medical Center, retiring as an emerita professor in 2000. These days, Holmes spends her time writing, researching and singing in a barbershop quartet. Her book, to be published by North Dakota State University Press, will be available this year.

Not long ago, they established a charitable remainder trust (CRT) to make the largest gift ever made to Northwest Hospital. They also made a generous gift to support research into post-traumatic stress disorder in UW Medicine's Department of Psychiatry. \"From a tax standpoint, from an income standpoint, from the standpoint of giving a substantial gift \u2014 in my judgment, the CRT is the best way to do it,\" he says.

The concept of cultural maturity, a key notion in CST, argues that modern-age institutions and ways of thinking are not the end points that we tend to assume them to be. Rather, an important and more \"grown-up\" chapter in the human narrative lies ahead (see culturalmaturityblog.net). Over the last 10 years, I've written three new works on cultural maturity and its implications: Hope and the Future: An Introduction to the Concept of Cultural Maturity, Cultural Maturity: A Guidebook for the Future and Quick and Dirty Answers to the Biggest of Questions: Creative Systems Theory Answers What It is All About (Really).\"1975 Betsy Evans, M.D., writes, \"The memo - rable summer of 2016!

When he returned to the U.S., he began a 40-year career with Dow Chemical Company, starting as a chemical engineer. He later served in leadership positions for the compa - ny's branches in Asia and Latin America, and, ultimately, as an executive vice president. He was named chairman of the board in 1982 and retired in 1986. Mr. Lundeen was a passionate advocate for medical care, especially in rural areas, and a great supporter of education and UW Medicine, establish - ing funds to support resident training in urology and neurological surgery, helping create a professorship in rural health, and supporting students with scholarships. He also served for nearly 20 years on a variety of UW Medicine committees. \"Bob was generous with all his resources \u2014 his finances, his time, his understanding of the needs of rural communities,\" says Paul G. Ramsey, CEO of UW Medicine. \"We were fortu - nate to have his friendship, and we and our students will remember him and Betty for many years to come.\" Mr. Lundeen is survived by family members and friends.

He soon discovered that his patients enjoyed it, too: Yu often creates illustra - tions that depict how treatments and surgical procedures will affect the body. \"Patients really seem to appreciate when I use a drawing to explain what's going to happen,\" says Yu. \"It adds a nice human touch.\" Yu, an illustrator since childhood, first considered a career in medicine during high school, when he worked in food services at a hospital. This interest was further cemented during his un - dergraduate studies at Yale University, where he worked in a lab researching the applications of nuclear medicine to cardiac care. \"Medicine seemed so dynamic, a field where I could continu - ously learn and affect people's lives directly,\" says Yu. While Yu is still pondering which surgical subspecialty to pursue, what is clear is the important role art plays in his life. Many of his illustrations tend toward the humorous side \u2014 Star Wars characters performing surgery or anthropomorphic organs carrying on conversations. Like his patients, Yu's peers and instructors also benefit from his creativity. Yu crafted 11 illustrations for Bruce Silverstein, M.D., Res. '69, UW clinical professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology, to bring a playful touch to his class lectures. \"Art allows me to put a humorous spin on the day-to-day frustrations of medical training,\" says Yu. \"It helps me maintain a positive outlook on the journey.\" View Yu's comics at mdcomix.blogspot.com \u00bbTHE HEALING ART OF ILLUSTRATION Some of his most profound experiences in medical school have come from clerkships at regional sites throughout the School's five-state WWAMI program, which offers edu - cational opportunities in Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. \"I got to be really involved with patient care, and my eyes were opened to the logistical complexity of medi - cine,\" says Yu. For example, during his psychiatry rotation in Wyoming, he found that many of his patients were uninsured, on limited incomes, or lived hours away from a doctor's office. \"To create a regimen that would work, I had to take into account not only what they needed medically but what was realistic for them to implement,\" says Yu. Yu is now completing clerkships at hospitals in Alaska and Idaho, along with a rotation in general surgery at UW Medical Center. \"I love being in the operating room,\" he says. \"I love working with my hands, and I love the fact that I can bring about rapid, dramatic changes to patients' health through surgery.\"Self-portrait: medical student David Yu. 56 / UW MEDICINECONTACT US UW Medicine Alumni Relations and Medical Education 206.543.1050 UW Medicine Alumni Association UW School of Medicine UW Medicine To learn more about alumni programs and events, visit UW Medicine magazine at uwmedmagazine.org \u00bb WINTER 2016 / 57CORPORATE CATAL YSTS Cumulative giving of $5 million or more Abbott Fund Amgen AstraZeneca InternationalBristol-Myers Squibb Company Cambia Health FoundationEli Lilly and Company GE Healthcare GSK BiologicalsMedtronic, Inc.Merck & Company, Inc.
