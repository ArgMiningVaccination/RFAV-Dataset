Description Tumor vaccines are a type of active immunotherapy that attempts to stimulate the patient's own immune system to respond to tumor antigens. Melanoma has been viewed as a particularly promising tumor for this type of treatment because of its immunologic features, which include the prognostic importance of lymphocytic infiltrate at the primary tumor site, the expression of a wide variety of antigens, and the occasional occurrence of spontaneous remissions. Melanoma vaccines can be genera lly categorized or prepared in a variety of ways . Summary Despite considerable interest and numerous studies over the past 20 years, to date no melanoma vaccine has been shown to demonstrat e safety and efficacy in a well -controlled published Phase III clinical trial and no vaccine treatment for this cancer has been approved by FDA. A wide range of vaccine choices are available including use of autologous tumor cells, allogeneic tumor cells, and tumor -specific moieties including peptides, gangliosides, and DNA plasmids. A variety of mechanisms appear to exist as possible obstacles to successful active immunotherapy using vaccines. Current studies are focused on the use of new and different vaccine preparations, as well as on various forms of immune -modulation as potential techniques for enhancing vaccine effectiveness.
