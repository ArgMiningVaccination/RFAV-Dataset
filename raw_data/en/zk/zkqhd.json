In addition, these manuals serve as an Annex to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the Department of Public Health (DPH) Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). The purpose of this manual is two-fold. First, to serve either as the official Policies and Procedures for the Administration of Vaccines and Provision of Immunization Services by a health district, or to be utilized as a guide for writing a district's Immunization Policies and Procedures. District Health Directors who choose to utilize these two publications as their district Policies and Procedures should review and sign both manuals annually. We encourage District Health Directors, Clinical Coordinators and Immunization Coordinators, as well as other providers, to review this manual and ensure that their district's policies are in conformance with those outlined in this document. Secondly, the purpose is to delineate the responsibilities and working relationships of state, district and county personnel in matters that concern the Immunization Office. Any discrepancies or errors found in the manual should be brought to the attention of the Immunization Office at (404) 657-3158 or email immunization@dhr.state.ga.us. Thank you for your support of the Immunization Office in Georgia.

INTRODUCTION Introduction to the Manual (REPLACE) Georgia Immunization Office Central Staff (REPLACE) Immunization Office Consultants (REPLACE) District Immunization Coordinators (REPLACE) Request for Immunization Forms---Form 3184 (REPLACE) U.S. Vaccines (Move To Chapter 2 After Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health Introduction To Manual 10/2012 1 The Georgia Immunization Manual is intended to provide District and County personnel with up-to-date information and guidance. The Georgia Immunization Manual is based primarily on the Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The ACIP Recommendations are provided as a separate manual. Thes e two manuals should be utilized together as the basis for fo rmulating policies and procedures for administering vaccines and providing immunization services. The Department of Public Health also recognizes the Red Book (Report of the Committee on Infect ious Diseases) of the Amer ican Academy of Pediatrics. Another important reference is the package insert supplied by the manufacturer of the vaccine. This manual and the ACIP Recommendations M anual represent official state policies and standards, and the recommended policies and procedures for administering vaccines, providing immunization services, and docum enting and evaluating quality assu rance. In addition these manuals serve as an annex to the Standard Operati ons Procedures (SOP) of the Department of Public Health (DPH), Emergency Operations Plan EOP). District s may utilize these two manuals as the district's written Policies and Procedures for Administering Va ccines by Registered and Licensed Practical Nurses or use this manual as a guide to write their own. In addition, districts may utilize the Quality Assurance (QA) document included in this manual as a tool to document and evaluate the credentialing, policies, training, adm inistration of vaccine and provisi on of immunization services. If a district chooses to utilize their own QA instrument, it should incl ude all elements in the QA document in this manual. Constructive cr iticism, questions and not ification of apparent e rror will be welcome, but deviation from state policy should not be undertaken lightly. St atements made in this manual take precedence over contradict ory policy statements or memo s that predate the manual pages. Occasionally, due to ongoing research and evaluation, ACIP recommendations may differ from the manufacturer's package insert or the info rmation in the Red Book , which is published every three years. When this occurs, the State Imm unization Program utilizes the most current ACIP Recommendations. Frequently, the ACIP publishes provisional guideli nes prior to receiving final approval from the Director of the CDC and the Secretary of the Department of Heal th and Human Services (HHS). To facilitate the administration of newly licensed vaccines, the G eorgia Immunization Program will utilize these provisional recommendations when necessary in developing guidelines. From time to time, children present at DPH clinics with requests or orders from private physicians to administer vaccines under unusual circumstances. When the request clearly falls outside the ACIP Recommendations, such as usi ng reduced dosage schedules, it simply should not be honored. When a child has a history or condition which calls for careful judgment as to whether it might be a contraindication and the physician assures that vaccine may be given safely, the District Health Director must make a decision whether to i mmunize or refer the child back to the physician. Each subject in the manual is dated. W hen changes are made, appropriately indexed pages will be made available on the program website to replace outdated material. Transmittal letters should be logged and filed in the Me mo section in the manual. When recommendation changes occur between t he annual manual updates, health districts will be notified by memos from the State Immuni zation Program. The Immunization Program Manual will be updated at least annually to include the recommended changes. Health districts are responsible for developing and impl ementing a plan to ensure that all memos and manual revisions are distributed, discussed, and impl emented within a month of receipt with all appropriate clinics and staff and that the Immunization Program Manuals and ACIP manuals are kept current. When questions arise that are not cove red adequately anywhere in the manual, the Immunization Program personnel are eager to field them and provide or obtain clarification. A staff person is available for on-call questions Monday thr ough Friday, from 8:00 A.M. until 5:00 P.M. The Immunization Program telephone numbers may be found in Section 1 of this manual.

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 9/2012 1 These vaccine guidelines represent a summar y of the pertinent information on each vaccine found in the most current ACIP Recommendations statements, Epidemio logy and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, 12th edition 2nd printing (The Pink Book), the 2012 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases , and in the most recent Vaccines for Children Program resolutions. These guidelines have been deve loped for use by RNs and LP Ns and are intended to be used as a quick but accurate source of guidanc e for practitioners gi ving immunizations or providing information about vaccines. For more specific details about any portion of these guidelines, the above-named refer ences should be consulted. These vaccine guidelines will be updated at least on a yearly basis, and more often as circumstances dictate. In addition to staff members of the Georgia Immunization Office, the following physicians have reviewed and appro ved the information provided therein: David Harvey, MD ___2/15/2012______ David Harvey, M.D. Date Signed District Health Director, North Central District, 5-2 Georgia Department of Public Health Immunization Office Vaccine Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 9/2012 Immunization Guidelines For DPH Clinics 1 A. Guidelines for Administration The Georgia Immunization Office recommends t hat all DPH clinics follow the current Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule that is developed and published annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). A copy of the most current schedule, including the footnotes, is inserted in this section of the manual. Additional charts and tables are included to provide assistance in further defining and clarifying the recommended schedule. Also included is a recommended infant/child screening questionnaire to assist providers in identifying possible contraindications and precautions for administering vaccines. The Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule and a Screening Questionnaire for Adults are also included in this section. The charts and tables are meant to serve as guidelines and provide quick references for individuals assessing immunization records and administering vaccines. Detailed information regarding vaccines and vaccine administration policies should be obtained from the most current ACIP Recommendations. These recommendations may be accessed from CDC's web site (see Immunization Resources in Section 13, Attachment A of this manual). It is imperative that all those who administer vaccines follow the guidelines put forth in the General Recommendations on Immunization ACIP statement 1, the Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the \"Pink Book\"),2 as well as those found in this manual in Chapter 13, Quality Assurance. The following principles are merely a summary of these recommendations and are not meant to be all-inclusive: 1. Ascertain the client's need for the recommended immunizations to avoid drawing up vaccine that will not be used. 2. Select correct needle size for vaccine, route, and size of client. 3. Double-check the vial label and expiration date before AND after drawing up vaccine. 4. If preparing multiple vaccinations, label eac h syringe or use labeled tray in order to correctly identify vaccines before administration. 5. Use aseptic technique throughout vaccine preparation, administration, and disposal of syringes and other materials. 6. Avoid prefilling syringes because of the risk for administration errors. Other problems that could be associated with this practice are vaccine wastage and possible bacterial growth in vaccines that do not contain a preservative. In addition, syringes other than those that are prefilled by the manufacturer are designed for immediate administration, not for vaccine storage. 7. If it is necessary to reconstitute more than one vaccine dose, as for a large influenza clinic, only prefill a FEW syringes at a time, which you can administer while someone else is prefilling a few syringes they will administer. Any syringes left at the end of the clinic day should be discarded . 8. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should MMR, MMRV, Zoster or varicella vaccine ever be reconstituted and drawn prior to the immediate need for the vaccines. These live virus vaccines are unstable and begin to deteriorate as soon as they are reconstituted with diluent. Immunization Guidelines For DPH Clinics Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 9/2012 Immunization Guidelines For DPH Clinics 29. All providers who administer vaccinations should be aware of the potential for syncope (fainting) after vaccination and take appropriate measures to prevent it. Thus, clinicians should (1) make sure that people who are being vaccinated are always seated; (2) be aware of symptoms that precede fainting (weakness, dizziness, pallor, etc.); and (3) take appropriate measures to prevent injuries if such symptoms occur.3 Vaccine providers should strongly consider observing vaccinated people for 15 minutes after vaccination.4 This is particularly important when vaccinating adolescents and young adults. B. Guidelines for Eligibility for VFC and State-Supplied Vaccines Eligibility criteria are outlined in each of the Immunization Program Vaccine Guidelines in this section. In addition, the table following this document outlines the eligibility criteria for vaccines provided by the Vaccines for Children Office (VFC ) and by the Georgia Immunization Office. All clinics are responsible for screening and documenti ng a person's eligibility for receiving state supplied vaccines. For the purposes of these documents, a child is defined as a person from 0 through 18 years of age. An adult is anyone 19 years of age or older. The following mandates should be utilized when conducting eligibility screening for either group: I. Eligibility Criteria for Children A. All children 0 through18 years of age should be screened to determine VFC eligibility using the following terms and definitions: 1. Medicaid---is eligible for Medicaid services. 2. American Indian/Alaska Native---self-reported by the patient. 3. Uninsured children---have no health insurance. 4. Underinsured children---have insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit. 5 Example: An insurance company may not cover certain vaccines, such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The child will qualify for VFC for that particular vaccine only. Example: An insurance company may cover immunizations up to a certain age. Up to that age, the child is fully insured. After that age, the child is considered underinsured (has insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit). Example: An insurance company may only provide $100.00 per year to cover the costs of immunizations. The child is fully insured up to $100.00. Once this amount is exhausted, the child is then eligible to receive VFC vaccine. 5. PeachCare for Kids---has a current PeachCare for Kids card at the time of service. 5 B. Any child who has insurance coverage for immunizations is not eligible to receive state-supplied vaccines. This is the case even when the insured has a high deductible --- the child is consider ed fully insured. These children should be: 1. referred to their private provider; or 2. administered vaccine purchased by the district. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 9/2012 Immunization Guidelines For DPH Clinics 3 II. Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by VFC for minors presenting for services without proof of insurance. Please use the following guidance: A. Unaccompanied minors through the age of 18 who are being seen in a public health STD or Family Planning clinic, and who present without proof of insurance, may be immunized using VFC vaccine. 1. Hep A, Hep B, and HPV are the only vaccines that may be administered to someone under the age of 18 based on their own consent. 2. Be aware that you may come across an 18 year old patient who is still covered by their parent's insurance, but is unable to access it. Because the patient is 18 she or he may legally consent for additional vaccines, all of which should be included on the Title X form. B. To document eligibility screening, records should reflect 'Uninsured' for this population. C. Complete Title X log sheet for any minor receiving vaccine in this category. III. Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults (Refer to table on following pages.) C. Guidelines for Documentation All public health clinics should be utilizing the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS) for reviewing and documenting the immunization status of all clients. Public health clinics should have the technologi cal capability and staff trained to ensure that, regardless of the individual software system used, immunizations administered will be entered into the GRITS system within 2 business days. 1 General Recommendations on Immunization, MMWR , January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, RR-2. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The intent of these tables: IS NOT to determine which children, adolescents and/or adults should be immunized, but IS to define which groups can be immunized with federally funded VFC or federally funded Section 317 purchased vaccines. For specific vaccine guidelines refer to Section 2, Recomme nded Schedules and Guidelines, of the Georgia Immunization Office Manual (GIO). The vaccine must be provided at no cost to the patient. Vaccine administration fees for self-pay clients are capped at $21.93 per injection for both VFC and Section 317 funded vaccine. No client should be refused vaccination with VFC or Section 317 vaccine due to inability to pay the administration fee. If a client meets at least one eligibility criterion for each component of a combination vaccine (e.g., Pediarix, Comvax, MMRV, Twinrix), they are eligible to receive that combinat ion vaccine if the state supplies it.

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---11/2012 Combination Vaccines 2General Guidelines for the U se of Combination Vaccines1 To minimize the number of injections children receive, parenteral combination vaccines should be used, if licensed and indicated for the patient's age, instead of their equivalent component vaccines. Recommended intervals and ages for single antigen vaccines, when used in combination series, should be observed. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines, in either monovalent or combination formulations from the same or different manufacturers, are interchangeable for sequential doses in the vaccination series. Using the same acellular pertussis vaccine product from the same manufacturer is preferable for at least the first three doses. However, if the brand is not known, ACIP recommends to vaccinate the child using the DTaP vaccine that is available. When patients have already received the recommended vaccinations for some of the components in a combination vaccine, administering the extra antigen(s) in the combination is often permissible if doing so will reduce the number of injections required and if the other components are not contraindicated. To avoid recording errors and ambiguities in the names of vaccine combinations, extra care should be taken to record exactly what was given. 1 General Recommendations on Immunization, MMWR , January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, No. RR-2 B. COMVAX\u00ae Vaccine Description COMVAX\u00ae is a combination of Haemophilus b Conjugate (PRP-OMPC or PedvaxHIB \u00ae) and hepatitis B vaccine (Recombinant pediatric formula or Recombivax HB).

It should not be given before 6 weeks of age or after the child turns 7 years old. This vaccine is not approved for booster doses. To complete the DTaP and IPV series, use those individual vaccines. Pediarix\u00ae is not approved for hepatitis B vaccine doses given at birth or at 1 month of age. Consequently, for those infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is positive or unknown and who should therefore receive the first 2 doses of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and age 1 month, this vaccine would be inappropriate. It may be used for the 3 rd dose of hepatitis B if given at the recommended 6 months of age. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---11/2012 Combination Vaccines 9 Dose 1 Dose 22 Dose 3 Booster 2 months of age 4 months of age 6 months of age Not approved for boo ster doses 1 This reflects the routinely recommended schedule. However, the vaccine may be administered as a primary series (Doses 1, 2, and 3) at any time between 6 weeks and 7 years of age. Conditional Pediarix Vaccine Schedule for Infants This conditional Pediarix schedule only validates t he Pediarix dose given as the 3rd dose in the series at age 4 months. This allows the series to be completed in 4 doses starting with a routine single antigen hepatitis B vaccine birth dose and the 2nd and 4th dose being any Hepatitis B antigen containing vaccine. This Pediarix hepatitis B series is considered acceptable as long as the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at or after age 6 months. The Hepatitis B series algorithm highlights are listed below. Dose 1* Dose 2 Dose 3 Dose 4 Birth dose 2 months of age 4 months of age 6 months of age Highlights: Doses given at 0*, 2M, 4M, 6M Dose 3 given at age 4M must be Pediarix and the trade name must be entered to be valid Dose 4 given on or after age 6M will be valid if ther e is at least a 28 day interval from Dose 3; 56 day interval from Dose 2; and 112 day interval from Dose 1. *This special series is conditional on the use of Pediarix after that routine birth dose Minimum Age and Dose Intervals1 Dose Minimum Age Time Interval to Dose 2 Time Interval to Dose 32 1 6 weeks 4 weeks3 8-12 weeks3 1 If the Pediarix\u00ae series is not completed until after age 4, the IPV series would be considered to be complete. However, an additional dose of DTaP would still be needed. 2Though Pediarix\u00ae cannot be used for a 4th or 5th booster dose, the intervals to the 4th or booster doses of any of the component vaccines (DTaP, hepatitis B, and IPV) should reflect the minimum interval for each of those vaccines.

ProQuad\u00ae Vaccine Description ProQuad\u00ae (MMRV) is a live virus vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. In September, 2005 it was licensed by the FDA for use in children ages 12 months through 12 years. It is a lyophilized preparation of the components of M-M-R rubella combination vaccine); and Virus Vaccine Live. This vaccine contains no preservative and comes packaged as single dose vials with separate vials of sterile water diluent. Special storage and handling guidelines include: o MMRV must be transported and stored at temperatures of 50 F. or colder. o It cannot be stored at refrigerator temperatures and must be used within 30 minutes of being reconstituted and cannot be refrozen. Guidance is provided in the December 2, 2005 MMWR article, \"Notice to of the ACIP\" , MMWR, May 7, 2010, Vol. 59, No. RR-3 Brand Name & Manufacturer Vaccine Manufacturer ProQuad\u00ae Merck Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---11/2012 Combination Vaccines 16 Eligible Groups for State Supplied Vaccine For Adults, Children, and Adolescents, see \"Eligibility for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Office for Children, Adolescents, and Adults\" located in the front of this section. Recommended Vaccine Schedule1 Dose 1 Dose 2 12-15 months 4-6 years 12-47 months 2 15-12 years 3 48 months and older 3 1 MMRV should only be used when both of the component vaccines (MMR and varicella) are indicated and the child is 12 months through 12 years of age. Routinely recommended ages for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccination are 12 through 15 mont hs of age for dose 1 and 4 through 6 years of age for dose 2. 2 Dose 1 at Ages 12 through 47 Months * For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at ages 12 through 47 months, either MMR and varicella vaccines or MMRV vaccine can be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Compared with use of MMR and varicella vaccines at the same visit, use of MMRV vaccine results in one fewer injection but is associated with a higher risk for fever and febrile seizures 5 through 12 days after the first dose among children aged 12 through 23 months* (about one extra febrile seizure for every 2,300-2,600 MMRV vaccine doses). Use of MMR and va ricella vaccines avoids this increased risk for fever and febrile seizures following MMRV vaccine. Providers who face barriers to clearly communicating these benefits and risks for any reason (e.g., language barriers) should administer MMR and varicella vaccines. 3 Dose 1 at Ages 48 Months and Older and Dose 2 at any Age For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and vari cella vaccines at ages 48 months and older and for dose 2 at any age (15 months through 12 years), us e of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR and varicella vaccines). Considerations should include provider assessment, patient preference, and the potential for adverse events. * The 47 month cut-off was chosen on the basis of th e epidemiology of febrile seizures: first febrile seizures are uncommon after ages 4 y ears, approximately 94% of febrile seizures occur in children aged less than 4 years. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---11/2012 Combination Vaccines 17 Minimum Age and Dose Intervals Dose Minimum Age Time Interval to Dose 2 1 12 months 3 months Spacing and timing of MMRV from individual component vaccines (MMR and varicella): At least 1 month should elapse between a dose of a measles-containing vaccine and a dose of MMRV. At least 3 months should elapse between a dose of varicella vaccine and a dose of MMRV. However, if a 2nd dose was administered after at least 28 days following the 1st dose, the 2nd dose does not need to be repeated. Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously Contraindications A. Contraindications Anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of any of the vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella) or to the vaccine components to include gelatin and neomycin Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever Altered immune status due to such things as malignancy, immunodeficiency, or immunosuppressive therapy Receipt of blood products---consult Appendix A of the listed reference for a table denoting the spacing of live virus vaccines and blood products. Steroid therapy---doses of systemic prednisone or equivalent at a dose of >2 mg/kg of body weight per day or 20 mg/day Persons receiving ongoing salicylate therapy In persons who develop a rash post-vaccination, there is a minimal risk of transmission of vaccine virus to close contacts. Thus, vaccinees in which vaccine-related rash develops, particularly healthcare workers and household contacts of immunocompromised persons, should avoid cont act with susceptible persons who are at high risk of serious complications. Pregnancy Untreated, active TB MMRV should not be administered to HIV infected persons who are severely immunocompromised. Consult Appendix A of the \"Pink Book,\" 12th edition, for directions on administration of single antigen live virus vaccines to immunocompromised persons. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---11/2012 Combination Vaccines 18 B. Precaution A personal or family (i.e., sibling, parent) history of seizures is a precaution for MMRV vaccination. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or family history of febrile seizures or family history of epilepsy are at increased risk for febrile seizures compared with children who do not have such histories. Children with a personal or family history of seizures generally should be vaccinated with MMR and varicella vaccines because the risks of using MMRV vaccine in this group of children generally outweigh the benefit of MMRV vaccine. Recent ( 11 months) receipt of antibody-containing blood product (specific interval depends on product) Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever History of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenic purpura Need for tuberculin skin testing (if TST (Tuberculosis skin test) and MMR are both need but not fiven on same day, delay TST for 4-6 weeks (i.e., famciclovir, or valacyclovir) 24 hours before vacation, if possible; delay resumption of these antivirals for 14 days after vaccination Use caution when administering to those with anaphylaxis or immediate hypersensitivity to eggs or contact hypersensitivity to neomycin Simultaneous Vaccine Administration May be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, DTaP, Tdap, Td, IPV, Hib, Influenza, MCV 4, MPSV 4, HPV, PCV 13, and PPSV23 Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 2.

Recommended Schedule & Guidelines - 2/2013 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 2 Vaccine Description A. DTaP Diphtheria and Tetanus and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine is an inactivated vaccine containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and purified inactivated components of Bordetella pertussis cells. DTaP is the recommended substitute for whole-cell DTP but should not be used if DTP has been contraindicated. Combination diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine is no longer available. B. TT Tetanus toxoid is an inactivated bacterial toxoid that may be prescribed for active immunization of persons over age 7 years. It is NOT to be used for the treatment of tetanus infection. F. Other information Single antigen diphtheria toxoid is not available. Diphtheria toxoid is available combined with tetanus as pediatric DT or adult Td, and with tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine as DTaP or Tdap. Use of single antigen tetanus toxoid is not recommended . DTaP and DT vaccines contain similar amounts of tetanus toxoid as adult Td vaccine, but 3-4 times as much diphtheria toxoid as adult Td vaccine.

Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines - 2/2013 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 4 Recommended Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis Vaccine Schedule A. DTaP 1, 2, 3 Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine is recommended as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and 4-6 years of age. Regardless of age and timing of doses, no more than a total of 6 DTaP vaccines should be given before 7 years of age. Dose Age Interval4 Primary 1 2 months ----------- Primary 2 4 months 8 weeks after 1 st dose Primary 3 6 months 8 weeks after 2nd dose First Booster 15-18 months5,6,11 6-12 months after 3rd dose7,8 Second Booster 4-6 years9, 10 Tdap or Td Booster 11-12 years B. DT If the child begins the series at <1 year of age, follow the schedule outlined above. If the child is 12 months of age at the time the 1st dose of DT is administered, a 2nd dose should be administered 4-8 wks. later, followed by a 3rd dose given 6-12 months after the 2nd dose. This completes primary vaccination with DT. A booster dose should be given at 4-6 years of age. C. Tdap use in adolescents and adults- based on ACIP guidelines for use of Tdap in adolescents and the guidelines for use of Tdap in adults. A (one-time dose) is recommended for persons 11 years of age through adulthood, providing they have previously completed the recommended DTP/DTaP/Td series and have not already received a dose of Td: Give in place of Td at the 11-12 year old healthcare visit. For those older adolescents or adults w ho have not already received a dose of Td. Can be given one time for tetanus prophylaxis in wound management, if a dose of Tdap has not previously been given. Can be used as any one of the 3 doses when administering a primary Td series to a person in the licensed age groups. Adults aged 65 years and older (e.g., grandparents, child-care providers, and health- care practitioners) who have or who anticipate having close contact with an infant less than 12 months of age and who previously have not received Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis and reduce the likelihood of transmission. For other adults aged 65 years and older, a single dose of Tdap vaccine may be given instead of Td vaccine, in persons who have not previously received Tdap. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus- or diphtheria-toxoid containing vaccine. Healthcare personnel (HCP), regardless of age, should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap and regardless of the time since the last Td dose. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines - 2/2013 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 5 D. Tdap use in pregnancy Pregnancy is not considered a contraindication of the use of Tdap. Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy irrespective of their prior history of receiving Tdap. Optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation. For women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. E. Td (refer to Tdap guidelines above for situations when that vaccine would be recommended instead of a dose of Td.) If administering as a primary series at 7 years of age, give at 0, 1, and 6 months. A Td booster is recommended at any age for persons regardless of interval since the previous dose of any tetanus-containing vaccine. Subsequent boosters are recommended at 10 year intervals. For wound management, give booster if >5 years have elapsed since last dose. F. Use of DTaP, DT, Td, Tdap, and Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG) 12 for Wound Management Refer to wound management guidelines in ACIP Manual: \"Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis: Recommendations for Vaccine Use and Other Preventive Measures, \" MMWR, August 8, 1991, pg. 16; \"Preventing Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Among Adolescents: Use of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines,\" MMWR, March 24, 2004, pg. 25. 1 Use diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, adsorbed (DT), if encephalopathy has occurred after administration of a previous dose of pertussis-containing vaccine. 2 ACIP recommends using the same brand of DTaP vacci ne for all doses of the series. However, if the brand used for previous doses is not known or not av ailable, use any brand of DTaP to complete the series. 3 Pertussis vaccine given as DTaP is not recommended for children 7 years of age. 4 Prolonging the interval does not require restarting the series. 5 If using Daptacel, this dose is recommended to be given at 17-20 months of age. ( MMWR , July 5, 2002, Vol. 51, No. 26, pp.574.) 6 Pediarix is licensed only for the primary series of 3 doses, not for the booster doses (#4and #5) 7The 4th dose of DTaP may be given as early as 12 mont hs of age, provided 6 months have elapsed since the 3rd dose and if the child is unlikely to re turn at 15-18 months of age. TriHIBit can be administered as the 4th dose following a primary series with either DTaP or whole-cell DTP and following a primary series with any Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine. 8 DTaP #4 does not need to be repeated if administered 4 months after DTaP #3. 9 A 5th dose is not necessary if the 4th dose was given on or after the 4th birthday. 10 Kinrix is licensed for the booster dose at age 4-6. \u00b9\u00b9 Pentacel is licensed for the primary series and 1st booster dose (Doses 1-4.) \u00b9\u00b2 The state does not supply TIG. There are 2 brands of TIG; hyperlet and bayle t. Providers can order TIG from their wholesaler or FFS Enterprise (-1-800-843-7477) or from the manufacturer, Talecris (1-800-243- 4153).

The combined DTaP-HepB-IPV vaccine is approved for the primary series only (Doses 1-3). For adequate immune response, the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given at 24 weeks of age and therefore this combination vaccine should not be administered as a complete primary series on an accele rated schedule at 4 week intervals for prevention of pertussis. 3 The combined DTaP-Hib-IPV vaccine may be used when any component of the combination is indicated, and if the other components are not contraindicated. The comb ined DTaP-Hib-IPV vaccine is approved for the primary series and first booster dose (Doses 1-4). The comb ined DTaP-Hib-IPV vaccine is not indicated for children 5 years. 4 The combined DTaP/Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine is indicated for the fourth dose at age 15-18 months. 5 The combined DTaP-IPV vaccine may be used when any compo nent of the combination is indicated, and if the other components are not contraindicated. The combined DTaP-IPV vaccine is approved for the booster dose at age 4-6 years. 6 Tdap is indicated for a single booster dose at age 11 or 12 years if the childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series has been completed. Tdap is preferred over Td as adolescents are susceptible to pertussis due to waning immunity, though Td may be indicated rather th an Tdap in special situations (more information is available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtm/rr5503a1.htm?s_cid=rr5503al_e ). Adolescents who did not receive Tdap at age 11 or 12 should receive a single dose of Tdap in place of a single Td booster dose. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus of diphtheria containing vaccine. 7 Tdap should be given to children 7 through 18 years of age who have received tetanus and diphtheria containing vaccines (DT or Td) instead of DTP/DTaP for some or all doses of the childhood series; have received fewer than 5 doses of DTP/DTaP or 4 doses if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older; or have never been vaccinated against teta nus, diphtheria, or pertu ssis (no doses of pediatric DTP/DTaP/DT or Td). The preferred schedule is a single Tdap dose, followed by a dose of Td four weeks after the first dose and a second dose of Td 6-12 months later. If not administered as the first dose, Tdap can be substituted for any of the other Td doses in the series. More information about the catch-up is available in Appendix D at: http://www.cdc.gov /mmwr/preview/mmwrhtm/rr5503a1.htm?s_cid=rr5503al_e Of note this appendix which was designed to provide catch up guidance for adolescents aged 11 through 18 years, now applies to children aged 7 through 18 years. Tdap is preferred over Td as adolescents are susceptible to pertussis due to waning immunity, though Td may be indicated rather than Tdap in special situations. 8 the ACIP Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Resolu tion for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC), (Resolution No. 6/11-2) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 2.

DTaP CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction following a previous dose. Defer further use of this vaccine because of the uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible. However, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons who experience anaphylactic reactions may be referred to an allergist for evaluation and, if specific allergy can be demonstrated, desensitized to tetanus toxoid. Encephalopathy following a previous dose not attributable to another identifiable cause. An acute, severe central nervous system disor der occurring within 7 days after vaccination and generally consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, or generalized or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, without recovery within 24 hours, is a contraindication to further administration of any DTaP-containing vaccine. B. PRECAUTIONS If any of the following events occurs within the specified period after administration of DTaP vaccine, providers and parents should evaluate the risks and benefits of administering subsequent doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine: Temperature of 105\u00b0F. (40.5\u00b0C.) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. Persistent crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. Latex Allergy Progressive neurological disorder including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy (postpone until stabilized). II. DT A. CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction. Defer further use of this vaccine because of the uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible. However, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons who experience anaphylactic reactions may be referred to an allergist for evaluation and, if specific allergy can be demonstrated, desensitized to tetanus toxoid. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines - 2/2013 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 8 B. PRECAUTIONS Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions. These are exaggerated local reactions that present as extensive, painful swelling, often from the shoulder to the elbow. Persons who experience arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions or a temperature of 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C.) following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid usually have high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should not be given DT or even emergency doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years, even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. Latex Allergy. III. Tdap A. CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine containing any of the 3 Tdap components: tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis. Encephalopathy not attributed to another identifiable cause, within 7 days of administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine (this is a cont raindication for the pertussis components; Td can be used). B. PRECAUTIONS Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions following a prior dose of a tetanus toxoid Progressive neurological disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive encephalopathy until a treatment regimen has been established and th e condition has stabilized. If decision is made to withhold pertussis vaccination, then Td may be used instead of Tdap. Latex allergy. The tip cap and rubber plunger of the BOOSTRIX\u00ae needleless prefilled syringe presentation contain dry natural latex rubber. The vial stoppers of both BOOSTRIX\u00ae and Adacel are latex-free. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after a previous dose of tetanus toxoid- containing vaccines. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. IV. Td A. CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction. Defer further use of this vaccine because of the uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible. However, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons who experience anaphylactic reactions may be referred to an allergist for evaluation and, if specific allergy can be demonstrated, desensitized to tetanus toxoid. Moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. B. PRECAUTIONS Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions. Pers ons who experience Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid usually have high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should not be given even emergency doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years, even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor.

This appendix taken from the ACIP statement \"P reventing Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Among Adolescents: Use of Tetanus Toxo id, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acel lular Pertussis Vaccines,\" MMWR, March 24, 2006, Vol. 55, No. RR-3.Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines - 2/2013 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 11 3-J. Inadvertent Administration of Tdap or Pediatric DTaP To help prevent inadvertent administration of Tdap when pediatric DTaP is indicated or pediatric DTaP when Tdap is indicated, vaccine providers should review product labels before administering these vaccines; the packaging might appear similar. Tdap is not indicated for children aged <10 years. Tdap contains lower amounts of diphtheria toxoid and lower amounts of some pertussis antigens compared with pediatric DTaP. Studies of the immune responses to Tdap among infants have not been conducted. Pediatric DTaP is not indicated for persons aged >7 years; the increased diphtheria toxoid content is associated with higher rates of adverse reactions in older persons ( 24-28). Guidance on the best approach to vaccination following inadvertent administration of Tdap or pediatric DTaP is based primarily on expert opinion. The family should be informed of any inadvertent vaccine administration. Adverse events associated with inadvertent vaccine administration can be reported to VAERS (see Reporting of Adverse Events after Vaccination). If Tdap is inadvertently administered instead of pediatric DTaP to a child aged <7 years as any one of the first three doses of the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination series, the Tdap dose should not be counted as valid, and a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP should be administered. If the inadvertent administration is discovered while the child is in the office, the pediatric DTaP can be administered during the same visit. If the child has left the office, some experts suggest administering the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP within approximately 72 hours, or administering it 4 weeks later to optimize the child's immune response to the antigens in pediatric DTaP. This practice helps ensure that the child stays on the primary series schedule and has adequate protection against diphtheria and pertussis. However, the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP can be administered as soon as feasible at any interval after the inadvertent Tdap dose. The remaining doses of the pediatric DTaP series should be administered on the routine schedule, with at least a 4 week interval between the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP and the next dose of pediatric DTaP. For example, if an 8-week week old infant inadvertently received a dose of Tdap instead of the first dose of pediatric DTaP and does not receive a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP within about 72 hours, a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP can be administered 4 weeks after the inadvertent Tdap dose (age 12 weeks). The routine schedule of pediatric DTaP can then be resumed 4 weeks after the pediatric DTaP replacement dose (age 16 weeks) with the other recommended vaccines ( 1,23). If Tdap is inadvertently administered as the fourth or the fifth dose in the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination series to a child aged <7 years, the Tdap dose should be counted as valid and does not need to be repeated; the child who received Tdap as a fourth dose should complete the pediatric DTaP schedule (23). The routine adolescent Tdap vaccination recommendations would apply when this child becomes an adolescent. For example, a child who inadvertently receives Tdap at age 5 years instead of the fifth dose of pediatric DTaP should receive a second dose of Tdap at age 11-12 years. If Tdap or pediatric DTaP is inadvertently administered to a child aged 7-9 years instead of Td as part of catch-up vaccination or for wound management, this dose can be counted as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive an adolescent booster dose of Tdap according to the interval guidance used for Td to Tdap (see Routine Tdap Vaccination [section 1-A] and Pertussis Outbreaks and Other Settings with Increased Risk for Pertussis or its Complications [section 3-C]). In either case, the child should receive a dose of vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids no longer than 10 years after the inadvertent Tdap or pediatric DTaP dose or according to the guidance for catch-up vaccination (Appendix E). If pediatric DTaP is inadvertently administered to an adolescent aged 11-18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. The adolescent should receive the next dose of a vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids 10 years after the inadvertent pediatric DTaP dose or according to the guidance for catch-up vaccination (Appendix D).* * This page excerpted from \"Preventing Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Among Adolescents: Use of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines,\" MMWR , March 24, 2006, Vol. 55, No. RR-3, pg. 27.

Children who are not vaccinated by age 2 years can be vaccinated at subsequent visits. States, counties, and communities with existing hepatitis A vaccination programs for children aged 2-18 years are encouraged to maintain these programs. Recommendations for persons who are at increased risk of infection: Persons traveling to developing countries which have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A Men who have sex with men (MSM) Users of injecting and non-injecting illegal drugs Persons who have clotting factor disorders Persons working with HAV infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting Persons with chronic liver disease Close personal contacts of children adopted from countries with high rates of hepatitis A Virus (HAV) \u00b9 Groups Recommended to Receive Hepatitis A Vaccine (cont'd) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines\u20149/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 3 Although hepatitis A may occur in other groups or settings, serologic surveys have not found that they are at increased risk for hepatitis A because of their occupation or setting, and are therefore not routinely recommended to receive vaccine. These would include: Food service establishments or food handlers Child care centers, employees or attendees Health-care institutions including specific hospital units Institutions for persons who have developmental disabilities Schools Sewage plants or sanitation workers \u00b9 \"Updated Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization (ACIP) for use of Hepatitis A Vaccine in Close Contacts of Newly Arriving International Adoptees,\" MMWR, September 18, 2009, Vol. 58.

If the interval between the first and booster doses of hepatitis A vaccine is longer than the recommended interval of 6-18 months, it is not necessary to repeat the first dose. For both vaccines, the booster dose given should be based on the person's age at the time of the booster dose, not the age when the first dose was given. For example, if a child received the first dose of the pediatric formulation of VAQTA at 18 years of age, and returns for the booster dose at age 19 years, the booster dose should be the adult formulation, not the pediatric formulation . Recommended Vaccine Dosage and Route 0.5 mL (pediatric formulations) administered intramuscularly 1 mL (adult formulations) administered intramuscularly Contraindications and Precautions to Vaccine1 Contraindications: 1. Allergy to any vaccine component. (For a complete listing of components, see package insert.) 2. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever Precautions: 1. Pregnancy. The safety of hepatitis A vaccination given during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because hepatitis A vaccine is produced from inactivated HAV, the theoretical risk to the developing fetus is expected to be low. The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in women who may be at high risk for exposure to HAV. 1For Twinrix\u00ae Contraindications and Precautions see \"Combination Vaccine Guidelines\" in this section. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration Hepatitis A vaccine may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines\u20149/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 5Recommendations for Hepatitis A Immunoprophylaxis (see January 2, 2008 Memorandum, \"New Policy for Hepatitis A Postexposure Prophylaxis\" located at the end of these guidelines) A. Immune Globulin (IG) Hepatitis A Immunoprophylaxis with Immune Globulin (IG) is routinely recommended in 2 situations: 1. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for international travel; and 2. Post-exposure prophylaxis for persons <12 months of age or >40 years of age who are contacts to acute cases of hepatitis A The provision of IG is available from the Epidemiology Branch for hepatitis A postexposure prophylaxis. The State Office of Pharmacy no longer stocks an IG supply. To obtain IG for this purpose, contact: 1. The appropriate designated distri ct epidemiology personnel; and 2. Hepatitis epidemiology staff in the st ate office at (404) 657-3158 or (404) 657-2588. (When calling to request IG, please have on hand the necessary information regarding name of hepatitis A case and number of contacts, with some descriptive information [i.e., ages].) Supplies of IG given for pre-exposure prophylaxis, i.e. international travel, should be purchased by districts. The guidelines below are only a minimum reference and any decision to use IG should be prefaced by further research using available resources, including medical providers. For more specific information, please see Chapter 6, \"Surveillance and Reporting\" in this manual, the ACIP Hepatitis A statement and the 2012 Red Book references cited in the opening paragraph of \"Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A.\" Pre-exposure Prophylaxis For persons traveling to certain parts of the world where hepatitis A has high or intermediate endemicity, immunoprophylaxis is indicated. For persons 1 years of age, vaccine is preferable over IG. However, for children under 1 year of age, and for those whose travel plans are imminent and therefore do not allow enough time for vaccine to provide adequate protection, IG may be the better choice. (Not supplied by the State) Post-exposure Prophylaxis for pers ons <12 months of age or >40 years of age Household and sexual contacts of persons with acute hepatitis A. Administration of IG should take place within 2 weeks of most recent exposure, and is not indicated if that period of time has already elapsed. IG should be administered as age appropriate to all previously unvaccinated staff and attendees of child care centers or homes if 1) one or more cases of hepatitis A are recognized in children or employees, or 2) cases are recognized in two or more households of center attendees. If a food handler is diagnosed with hepatitis A, IG should be administered to other food handlers at the same establishment. In the event of a common-source outbreak, IG should NOT be administered to exposed patrons after cases have begun to occur because the 2-week period dur ing which IG is effective will have been exceeded. Recommendations for Hepatitis A Immunoprophylaxis (cont'd) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines\u20149/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 6 For children aged <12 months, immunoc ompromised persons, persons who have had chronic liver disease diagnosed, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated, IG should be used. NOTE: IG would not routinely be recommended for: School settings, unless transmission within the school is documented. Hospital personnel caring for patients with hepatitis A disease, unless an outbreak among patients or between patients and staff is documented B. Hepatitis A Vaccine1,2 For healthy persons ages 12 months through 40 years, single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred to IG for post-exposure prophylaxis to hepatitis A infection because of vaccine advantages that include long-term protection and ease of administration. For person over 40 years of age, IG is preferred; vaccine can be used if IG cannot be obtained. 1 \"Update: Prevention of Hepatitis A After Exposure to Hepatitis A Virus and in International Travelers,\" MMWR , October 19. 2007, Vol. 56, No. 41 2 See pages 1-5 of the Hepatitis A guidelines for the recommended schedule, minimum intervals, and contraindications and precautions for hepatitis A vaccine.

Ordinarily, no more than 5 mL should be administered in 1 site in an adult or large child; lesser amounts (maximum 3 mL) should be given to small children and infants in one site. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines\u20149/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 7Contraindications and Precautions to IG Contraindications: 1. Persons with IgA deficiency. Anaphylaxis has been reported after repeated administration of IG to these persons. 2. Pregnancy or lactation is NOT a contraindication to IG use. Precautions: 1. IG can interfere with the response to live injected vaccines, such as MMR, varicella, and LAIV. Administration of live vaccines should be delayed for at least 3 months after administration of IG (See Table 4 of ACIP \"General Recommendations on Immunization\" for more specific guidelines.) 2. Unless the benefits of IG prophylaxis exceed the benefits of vaccination, IG should not be administered for 2 weeks after measles-, mumps-, and rubella-containing vaccines, and for 3 weeks after vaccination with varicella vaccine. If IG is given during this period, the person should be revaccinated with the live vaccine, but not sooner than 3 months after administration of IG. Simultaneous Administration of IG with Vaccines Immune Globulin does not interfere in general with inactivated vaccines or to yellow fever vaccine. It may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, Hib, hepatitis PCV13, PPSV23, HPV, MCV4. Seroconversion rates are not impaired by simultaneous administration of IG with the first dose of Hepatitis A vaccine, but lower serum antibody concentrations may be achieved. This decreased immunogenicity is not likely to be clinically important. See \"Contraindications and Precautions\" section regarding administration of IG with or near live virus vaccines such as MMR, varicella., and LAIV Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2.

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Disease 2 ACIP Recommendations for Administration of ZosterVax\u00ae1 Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged > 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or to treat ongoing PHN. Vaccination of Persons who have received Varicella Vaccine Zoster vaccination is not recommended for persons of any age who have received varicella vaccine. However, health-care providers do not need to inquire about varicella vaccination history before administrating zoster vaccine beca use virtually all persons currently or soon to be in the recommended age group have not received varicella vaccine. In the United States, varicella vaccination began in 1995. Since that time, few adults aged 40 years would have been susceptible to varicella and thus eligible to receive varicella vaccine. The number of persons eligible for zoster vaccine who have received varicella vaccine is extremely small and will remain so for at least a decade.

History or primary or acquired immunodeficiency states including leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other mali gnant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system; AIDS or other clinical manifestations of infection with HIV 3. Individuals on immunosuppressive therapy, including high-dose corticosteroids 4. Individuals with active untreated tuberculosis 5. Women who are or may become pregnant 6. Persons undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Precautions: 1. Moderate to severe illness Special Groups and Circumstances 1. Persons with a reported history of zoster can be vaccinated 2. Persons anticipating immunosuppression- The risk for zoster and its severe morbidity and mortality is much greater among persons who are immunosuppressed. Such patients without a history of zoster vaccination should receive 1 dose of zoster vaccine at the first possible clinical encounter while their immunity is intact. Zoster vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, although some experts advise waiting 1 month after zoster vaccination to begin immunosuppressive therapy if delay is possible 3. Persons receiving antiviral medication- These agents might interfere with replication of the live, VZV-based zoster vaccine 4. Persons receiving blood products-Zoster vaccine can be administered to persons at any time before, concurrent with, or after receiving blood or other anti-body- containing blood products.

HPV types 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer. Types 6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of genital wart cases. This product does not contain a preservative or antibiotics. After thorough agitation, it is a white, cloudy liquid. Cervarix \u00ae is a Human papillomavirus bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine, recombinant] for the prevention of cervical pre-cancers and cervical cancer associated with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 for use in girls and young women (aged 10-25). It is important to emphasize these points: Females should continue to have r outine cervical cancer screening as recommended by their healthcare provider. Females do not need to get an HPV test, Pap test or pregnancy test before receiving vaccine. If the person is already infected, the tests cannot tell which type of HPV she has. There are many types of HPV and vaccination would provide protection against infection with those types not already acquired. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2.

No. RR-08 Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), MMWR, August 18, 2011, Vol. 60 Vaccine Description Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) contains hemaglutinins of 3 strains of virus (typically two (2) type A and one (1) type B), representing the influenza viruses likely to circulate in the U.S. in the upcoming winter. This injectable vaccine is inactivated, but because the viruses were initially grown on embryonated hens' eggs, the vaccine might contain limited amounts of residual egg protein. Manufacturers may use different compounds to inactivate the viruses and add antibiotics to prevent bacterial contamination during production. Therefore, package inserts should be consulted for additional information regarding potential allergenic components. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is a live, trivalent nasally- administered vaccine. It contains the same strains of influenza virus as the inactivated vaccine. It is manufactured in a manner similar to the TIV so the same precautions should be taken with regard to potential allergenic components.

Those children aged 6 months through 8 years who received greater than or equal to 1 dose of the 2010-11 seasonal vaccine require 1 dose for the 2011-12 season. 2 Not licensed to be used in children less than 4 years of age. 3 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends Afluria not be used in children aged 6 months through 8 years because of increased reports of febrile reactions in this age group. 4 Licensed for use only in healthy, nonpregnant persons 2 through 49 years of age. Children, 2-4 years, whose parents or caregivers report their child has had an asthma or wheezing episode noted in the medical record within the past 12 months should not receive Flumist. 5 Administer as 0.1 mL in each nostril. 6 All children ages 6 months to less than 8 years receiving the influenza vaccine for the first time and requiring 2 doses do not have to use the same type of vaccine for both doses. The first and second doses do not have to matc h; live or inactivated vaccine can be used for either dose. The doses should be s eparated by at least one month. 7 The ACIP does not have a preference for any influenza vaccine presentation or formula. *See package insert on Fluzone Intradermal Influenza Vaccine at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM1954 79.pdf For administration instructions. If a person reports a severe (anaphylactic) allergy to latex, vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain natural rubber should not be administrated unless the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk for a potential allergic reaction.

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---09/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Influenza 6 Contraindications/ Precautions (TIV Contraindications Trivalent Inactivated reaction to previous influenza vaccination; hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (e.g. thimerosal, or any antibiotic used as a preservative). Moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. Persons with moderate or severe illness should be immunized as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Minor illnesses (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis) with or without fever should not contraindicate the use of influenza vaccine. Pregnant women should avoid TIV influenza vaccine containing thimerosal. Contraindications specific to Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV ) Persons with a history of hypersensitivity, in cluding anaphylaxis, to any of the components of LAIV or to eggs (e.g. eggs, thimerosal, or any antibiotic used as a preservative). Moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. Persons with moderate or severe illness should be immunized as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Minor illnesses (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis) with or without fever should not contraindicate the use of influenza vaccine. Persons aged less than 2 years or thos e aged greater than or equal to 50 years. Persons with any of the underlying medical condi tions that serve as an indication for routine influenza vaccination, including asthma , reactive airways disease, or other chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; other underlying medical conditions, including such metabolic diseases as diabetes, renal dy sfunction, and hemoglobinopathies; or known or suspected immunodeficiency diseas es or immunosuppressed states. Pregnancy Risk Categories A Controlled studies in pregnant women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester with no evi dence of risk in later trimesters. The possibility of fetal harm appears remote. B Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are not controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in cont rolled studies in women in the first trimester and there is no evidence in later trimesters. C Either studies in animals have re vealed adverse effects on the fetus and there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefits justify the potentia l risk to the fetus. D There is positive evidence of human fe tal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective). X Studies in animals or humans beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---09/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Influenza 7 Children aged 2-4 years whose parents or caregi vers report that a health-care provider has told them during the preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma, or whose medical record indicates a wheezing episode has occurred during the preceding 12 months. Children or adolescents receiving aspirin or ot her salicylates (because of the association of Reye syndrome with wild-ty pe influenza virus infection). Persons with a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Sy ndrome (GBS) within six weeks after receiving influenza vaccination. Pregnant women . Healthcare Providers, hous ehold/ close contacts of seve rely immunosuppressed persons requiring a protective environment. Precautions specific to TIV Anaphylactic reaction to eggs. S ee Figure 2 for persons who report allergy to eggs. If vaccination is admi nistered, use TIV rather than LAIV. Precautions (TIV or LAIV) History of GBS following influenza vaccination is a precaution for administering Trivalent Influenza Vaccine. Avoiding vaccinating persons who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination is prudent. Although data are limited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the risks for many persons who have a history of GBS and who are also at high ri sk for severe complications from influenza. The tip cap and rubber plunger of Fluarix, Fluzone, Fluzone High-Dose, and Fluvirin. pre-filled syringes contain dry natural latex rubber and may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals. Immunization should be delayed in a patient with an active neurologic disorder, but should be considered when the disease process has been stabilized. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

See \"Combination Vaccines\" in this section for more information. Children whose vaccination history indicates they have received single antigen measles and/or mumps vaccine, should receive MMR to complete the 2nd dose requirement for each. 3 Previously unvaccinated children beyond t he recommended 12-15 months of age should receive the 1st dose of MMR as soon as possible. The 2nd dose can be provided at any age from 13 months on, as long as there has been an interval of at least 28 days between doses. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2.

However, doses of MMR administered before 1 year of age should not be counted. Any child receiving vaccine before 1 year of age should be re-vaccinated at 12-15 months of age, with an additional dose at the time of school entry. Doses of any measles-containing vaccine should be separated by at least 28 days.

Recommended Schedule & Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 4 Adequate presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps for persons who work in health care facilities: Measles : Documented administration of two doses of live measles virus vaccine1 or Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or Born before 1957123 Rubella Documented administration of one dose of live rubella virus vaccine1 or Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or Born before 1957 (except women of childbearing age who could become pregnant) 123 Mumps Documented administration of two doses of live mumps virus vaccine1 or Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or Born before 1957123 1 May vary depending on current state or local requirements. 2 For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with two doses of MMR vacc ine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. 3 For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend two doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050577.htm Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 5Contraindications and Precautions A. Contraindications 1. Previous anaphylactic reactions to any vaccine component (i.e. gelatin or gelatin- containing products, or topically or systemically administered neomycin), or following a previous dose of MMR vaccine 2. Moderate or severe illness with or without fever 3. Pregnancy - Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus, women of childbearing age should receive MMR or its component vaccines only if they state they are not pregnant and are counseled not to become pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination. However, MMR or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccination inadvertently given during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to consider interruption of pregnancy. Known altered immunocompetence - Replication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune deficiency diseases and in persons with immunosuppression. Severe immunosuppression may be caused by many disease conditions (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, hematologic or generalized malignancy) and by therapy with immunosuppressive agents, including large doses of corticosteroids. The degree to which affected persons are immunocompromised can depend on the disease, its severity, and the treatment stage. Ultimately, the patient's physician must assume responsibility for determining whether the patient is severely immuno-compromised based on clinical and laboratory assessment . B. Precautions 1. Thrombocytopenia---Persons who have an episode of thrombocytopenic purpura within 6 weeks of vaccination with MMR should weigh the risk versus the benefit of receiving a 2nd dose. Serologic testing of immunity should be considered in lieu of MMR vaccination. 2. Recent receipt of blood, plasma, or immune globulin (in past 3-11 months) --- Blood and other antibody containing blood products, including immune globulin (IG) preparations, can diminish the immune response to MMR or its individual component vaccines. MMR or its component vaccines should be given at least 2 weeks before administration of an immune globulin or blood or blood-containing product or deferred until 3 or more months after administration of such preparations. (See Table 4 in this chapter for more specific guidelines regarding the time to wait before administering vaccine.) 3. Tuberculin skin tests --- MMR vaccine may interfere with the response to a tuberculin test. If such testing is otherwise indicated, it can be done either on the same day as MMR vaccine is administered or 4-6 weeks later. 4. Corticosteroid therapy --- Such therapy usually does not contraindicate the administration of live virus vaccines such as MMR when therapy is: a) short term (i.e. <14 days) low-to-moderate dose; b) low-to-moderate dose administered daily or on alternate days; c) long term alternate day treatment with short-acting preparations; d) physiologic maintenance doses (replacement therapy); or e) administered topically (skin or eyes), by aerosol, or by intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection. Doses that are considered to be immunosuppressive are those equivalent to or greater than a prednisone dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight per day or a total of 20 mg per day.

Due to limited funds, the state does not supply vaccine for these additional categories. These guidelines are meant to provide information for those districts and clinics that administer this vaccine from privately purchased stock. The following populations are at increased risk for meningococcal disease and are recommended to be vaccinated: College freshman who live in dormitories Military recruits Persons who will be traveling to or reside in areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to N. meningitidis in solutions that may be aerosolized Patients with anatomic or functional asplenia and patients with terminal complement deficiency Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2.

If syncope develops, patients should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Use of Meningococcal Conjugate V accine (MCV4) vs. Meningococcal Polysaccharide is the preferred vaccine for people 2-55 years of age in these risk groups, but MPSV4 can be used if MCV4 is not available. MPSV4 should be used for adults over 55 who are at risk. (See Section B, MPSV4, of this document.)

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Meningococcal Disease 7 ACIP Recommendations for Ad ministration of MPSV4 ACIP recommends that MPSV4 should be used for adults age 56 and older who are at risk for meningococcal disease. The following high risk populations in that age group are recommended to be vaccinated with MPSV4: Persons who are traveling to countries in which N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged Persons with terminal complement deficiencies and those with anatomic or functional asplenia Persons who are infected with HIV Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory personnel who routinely are exposed to N. meningitidis in solutions that may be aerosolized Persons who might have been exposed to meningococcal disease during an outbreak Revaccination: Persons who previously were vaccinated with MPSV4 at age 7 years and are at prolonged increased risk should be revaccinated 5 years after their previous meningococcal vaccine with MCV4. Persons who previously were vaccinated at ages 2--6 years and are at prolonged increased risk should be revaccinated 3 years after their previous meningococcal vaccine with MCV4. Persons at prolonged increased risk for meningococcal disease include 1) persons with increased susceptibility such as persistent complement component deficiencies (e.g., C3, properdin, Factor D, and late complement component deficiencies), 2) persons with anatomic or functional asplenia, and 3) persons who have prolonged exposure (e.g., microbiologists routinely working with Neisseria meningitidis, or travelers to or residents of countries where meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic. Persons who remain in one of these increased risk groups indefinitely should continue to be revaccinated at 5-year intervals with MCV4. College freshmen living in dormitories who were vaccinated with MPSV4 5 years previously are recommended to be vaccinated with MCV4.1 \u00b9 \"Updated Recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for Revaccination of Persons at Prolonged Increased Risk for Meningococcal Disease\", MMWR , September 25, 2009/ 58(37) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2.

Allergy to vaccine components Anaphylactic reaction to either MPSV4 or MCV4 or a constituent of either of these vaccines, including diphtheria toxoid (for MCV4) or dry natural rubber latex. 2. Acute, moderate, or severe illnesses with or without fever Persons with moderate or severe illness should be immunized as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Minor illnesses (e.g. upper respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis) with or without fever should not contraindicate the use of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 3. Latex The stoppers to the vials of lyophilized vaccine and diluents contain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive persons. 4. Altered Immunocompetence Persons who are immunosuppressed, including persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to MPSV4 Based on data from studies involving use of meningococcal vaccines and other polysaccharide vaccines administered during pregnancy, altering meningococcal vaccination recommendations for MPSV4 during pregnancy is unnecessary.

Vaccine Description Trivalent oral polio vaccine was the vaccine of choice in the U.S. from the time it was licensed in 1963. Since wild virus-induced paralytic polio was essentially eliminated in the western hemisphere by 1979, vaccine-induced paralytic polio (VAPP) became the greater risk. Therefore, in order to further the goal of eliminating any paralytic polio in the U.S., the ACIP recommended that inactivated polio vaccine be used exclusively, beginning in 2000. Oral polio vaccine is no longer available in the U.S. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced in the U.S. in 1955 but was largely replaced by OPV in the 1960's. Enhanced-potency IPV (e-IPV) was licensed in 1987 and is now the preferred polio vaccine.

However, for infants in whom the first dose is inadvertently admin istered off label at age 15 weeks and 0 days or later, the rest of the vaccine series should be completed as per the schedule. 2 ACIP recommends that the rotavirus vaccine series be completed with the same product whenever possible. However, vaccination should not be deferred because the product used for a previous dose(s) is not available or unknown. Continue or complete the series with product available. NOTE: Infants who have had rotavirus gastroenteritis before receiving the full course of rotavirus vaccinations should still initiate or complete the 3-dose schedule because the initial infection frequently provides only partial immunity. Special Situations: 1. Premature infants (< 37 weeks gestation)----immunize if they are: a. At least 6 weeks of age b. Clinically stable c. Being or have been discharged from the nursery 2. Infants living in households with immunocompromised persons can be vaccinated. The benefit to the household members of vaccinating young children outweighs the small risk for transmitting vaccine virus to immunocompromised persons. To minimize even this risk, all household members should employ good hygiene practices, especially after changing the infant's diapers. 3. Regurgitation of the vaccine dose---if for any reason an incomplete dose is administered (e.g., infant spits or regurgitates the vaccine), a replacement dose is not recommended. The infant should continue to receive any remaining doses in the recommended series at appropriate intervals. 4. Infants living in households with pregnant women can be vaccinated. 5. Hospitalization after recent rotavirus vaccination---no precautions other than routine standard precautions need be taken. Rotavirus may be administered at any time before, concurrent with, or after administration of any blood product, including antibody-containing products.

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines\u20149/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Rotavirus Gastroenteritis 3 Contraindications and Precautions Contraindications: 1. Serious allergic reaction to vaccine components or after receiving a previous dose of rotavirus vaccine 2. Infants with Severe Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) Precautions: 1. Acute gastroenteritis--- rotavirus vaccine should not be administered to infants with acute, moderate to severe gastroenteritis until the condition improves. 2. Moderate to severe illness---vaccinate infants as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. 3. Preexisting chronic gastrointestinal disease---providers should consider the potential risks and benefits of administering this vaccine to infants with this preexisting condition. Infants with preexis ting chronic malabsorption syndromes , Hirschsprung's disease, short-gut syndrome, or persistent vomiting of unknown cause) and not undergoing immunosuppressive therapy should benefit from rotavirus vaccination and the benefits outweigh the theoretical risks. 4. Intussusception---the current rotavirus vaccine has shown no evidence of an association with intussusception. However, additional post-licensure surveillance data are required to confirm that the vaccine is not associated with intussusception. Until post-licensure data on safety of rotavirus vaccine are available, the risks and benefits of vaccination should be considered when vaccinating infants with a previous episode of intussusception. Until further safety data is available, vaccination of these infants with rotavirus vaccine should be delayed. 5. Altered immunocompetence---providers should consider the potential risks and benefits of administering rotavirus vaccine in this situation. Shedding of the vaccine virus may be possible, particularly after administration of the first dose. Caution is advised when considering whether to administer rotavirus vaccine to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts. No safety or efficacy data are available for the administration of this vaccine to infants who are potentially immunocompromised including: a. Infants with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type or other malignant neoplasms b. Infants on immunosuppressive ther apy (including high-dose systemic corticosteroids) c. Infants with primary and acquired immunodeficiency states d. Infants who are HIV-exposed or infected. However, two considerations support vaccination of HIV-exposed or infected infants: first, the HIV diagnosis might not be established in infants born to HIV-infected mothers before the age of the first rotavirus vaccine and second, vaccine strains of rotavirus are considerably attenuated.

For infants to whom dose 1 is administered inadvertently at age 15 weeks and 0 days or older, the rest of the rotavirus vaccination series should be completed according to the schedule and by 8 months and 0 days. 2 The minimum interval between doses of rotavirus va ccine is 4 weeks; no maximum interval is set. 3 ACIP recommends that the rotavirus vaccine se ries be completed with the same product whenever possible. However, vaccination shoul d not be deferred because the product used for a previous dose(s) is not available or unknown. Continue or complete the series with product available. If any dose in the series is RV5 or t he vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total of 3 doses of rotavirus should be administered. NOTE: Infants who have had rotavirus gastroenteritis before receiving the full course of rotavirus vaccinations should still initiate or complete the 2-dose schedule because the initial infection frequently provides only partial immunity. Special Situations: 1. Premature infants (< 37 weeks gestation)----immunize if they are: a. At least 6 weeks of age b. Clinically stable c. Are being or have been discharged from the nursery 2. Infants living in households with immunocompromised persons can be vaccinated. The benefit to the household members of vaccinating young children outweighs the small risk for transmitting vaccine virus to immunocompromised persons. To minimize even this risk, all household members should employ good hygiene practices, especially after changing the infant's diapers. 3. Regurgitation of the vaccine dose---if for any reason an incomplete dose is administered (e.g., infant spits or regurgitates the vaccine), a replacement dose is not recommended. The infant should continue to receive any remaining doses in the recommended series at appropriate intervals. 4. Infants living in households with pregnant women can be vaccinated. 5. Hospitalization after recent rotavirus vaccination---no precautions other than routine standard precautions need be taken. Rotavirus may be administered at any time before, concurrent with, or after administration of any blood product, including antibody-containing products. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration May be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Hib, Hepatitis B, IPV, inactivated Influenza, and PCV13 Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2.

If a child is 15 months or older and has not had the disease, the child should be immunized at the earliest opportunity. Vaccine Dose2 Age (for routine vaccination)3 Varicella 1 12-15 months 2 4-6 years In addition, varicella vaccination is recommended in the following situations: A 2nd dose catch-up for all children, adolescents, and adults who previously had received one dose. Vaccination should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T- lymphocyte percentage 15% and may be considered for adolescents and adults in with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 200 cells/ \u00b5L. DO NOT use MMRV vaccine for these persons. For postpartum women whose prenatal assessment indicated susceptibility to varicella disease, the 1st dose of vaccine should be administered before discharge from the healthcare facility and the 2nd dose scheduled at an appropriate interval. During a varicella outbreak, a 2nd dose of vaccine should be given to those who had previously only received 1 dose, provided the appropriate minimum interval has elapsed since the first dose.3 Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 3Recommended Varicella Vaccine Schedule (cont'd) Other adults who should receive special consideration for varicella vaccine if determined not to be immune: o Healthcare providers o Household contacts of immunocompromised persons o Persons in environments where transmission of VZV is likely, such as teachers, childcare employees, persons in institutional settings, college students, staff and inmates of correctional institutions, and military personnel. o Nonpregnant women of childbearing age o Adolescents and adults living in households with children o International travelers 1 See Guidelines for Documentation of Immunity below. 2 Doses of varicella may be given as MMRV if the ch ild is 12 months through 12 years of age, and a dose of MMR is also indicated. See \"Combination Vaccin e\" guidelines in this section for more information. 3 Minimum interval from dose 1 to 2: 3 months if 1st dose is given at <13 years of age 4 weeks if 1st dose is given at 13 years of age NOTE: Varicella vaccine is effective in preventing illness or modifying varicella severity if it is administered within 3 days and possibly up to 5 days after exposure. Guidelines for Public Health Clinics Documentation of Varicella Immunity These guidelines are to be used by nurses in public health clinics to document varicella immunity. This documentation will be for issuing a \"Certificate of Immunization\" for childcare and school attendance. 1. Documentation of age-appropriate vaccination: Ages 12 months through preschool----1 dose Kindergarten through adulthood---2 doses 2. Laboratory evidence of immunity or confirmation of disease 3. Born in the US before 1980. For healthcare providers & pregnant women birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity. 4. Healthcare provider diagnosis of disease or documentation of history of disease Typical case history o Recollection of an itchy, blister-like rash that lasted about a week with o History of known exposure to shingles or a typical case of chickenpox (fever and maculopapular rash with successive crops of vesicular lesions in different stages) o Documentation should be made by licensed medical personnel (e.g., physician, public health nurse, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner); however, the Immunization Certificate must be signed by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant licensed in Georgia or by a Public Health Official. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 4 Guidelines for Public Health Clinics Docume ntation of Varicella Immunity (cont'd) Mild or atypical case history o Assessment should be made by licensed medical personnel (e.g., physician, public health nurse, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner ) and one of the following should be sought: \u0083 An epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case, or a laboratory confirmed case \u0083 Evidence of laboratory confirmation (if the testing was performed at the time of acute disease) If none of the above can be ascertained, vaccination with appropriate doses of varicella vaccine should be considered. 5. History of herpes zoster (shingles) based on healthcare provider diagnosis Recommended Doses & Intervals Vaccine Minimum age Minimum interval from dose 1 to 2 1 Dose 1 12 months 3 months Dose 2 13 months ----- 1 If 2 doses of varicella vaccine are given during the time the child is 12 months through 12 years of age, the minimum interval between doses is 3 months. Once the child turns 13 years of age, the minimum interval between the 2 doses is 1 month . However, regardless of the child's age, if the 2nd dose was administered after at least 28 days following the 1st dose, the 2nd dose does not need to be repeated. Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 5 Contraindications and Precautions A. Contraindications and Precautions 1. Allergy to vaccine components Anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine or a constituent of the vaccine (e.g., gelatin or neomycin) 2. Moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever Varicella vaccine can be administered to persons with minor illness, such as diarrhea; mild upper respiratory tract infection, with or without low grade fever; or other illnesses with low grade fever. Persons with an illness associated with a moderate or severe fever should be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Although no data exist as to whether varicella or live varicella virus vaccine exacerbates tuberculosis, vaccination is not recommended for persons who have untreated, active tuberculosis. Tuberculin skin testing is not a prerequisite for varicella vaccination. 3. Altered immune status Altered immune status due to: a malignant condition (blood dyscrasia, leukemia, 1 lymphoma, or other neoplasms affecting t he bone marrow or lymphatic system); primary or acquired immune deficiency, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other clinical manifestations of HIV infection, cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia, and dysgammaglobulinemia; family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless immune competence of possible vaccine recipient is demonstrated; and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy. See ACIP statement cited in the opening paragraph of \"Vaccines to Prevent Varicella.\" 4. Receipt of blood products Varicella virus vaccine should not be given for at least 5 months after receipt of blood (except washed red blood cells) or plasma transfusions, Immune Globulin (IG), or Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG). In addition, IG and VZIG should not be administered for 3 weeks after vaccination unl ess the benefits of receiving the IG or VZIG exceed the benefits of vaccination. 5. Steroid therapy Receiving doses of systemic prednisone or its equivalent at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight per day or 20 mg/day. 6. Exposure of immunocompromised persons to vaccinees In persons who develop a rash post-vaccination, there is a minimal risk of transmission of vaccine virus to close contacts. Thus, vaccinees in whom vaccine-related rash develops, particularly health care workers and household contacts of immunocompromised persons, should avoid contact with susceptible persons who are at high risk of serious complications. 7. Salicylates Due to the association between wild varicella zoster infection, salicylates, and Reye syndrome, if feasible, vaccine recipients should avoid using salicylates for 6 weeks after receiving varicella virus vaccine. Vaccination with subsequent close monitoring should be considered for children who have conditions requiring therapeutic aspirin because the risk for serious complications associated with aspirin is likely to be greater in children in whom natural varicella disease develops than in children who receive the vaccine containing attenuated varicella zoster virus. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Guidelines---9/2012 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 6 8. Pregnancy Theoretically, it is best not to administer varicella vaccine to pregnant women. Woman who are not pregnant but are of childbearing age who receive the vaccine should be advised not to become pregnant for at least 1 month after each injection. Merck and the CDC have established a hotline to monitor the maternal/fetal outcomes of women who are vaccinated with varicella 3 months before or at any time during the pregnancy. The phone number is (800) 986-8999. 9. Nursing mothers Whether attenuated varicella (VZV) vaccine is excreted in human milk and, if so, whether the infant could be infected, are not known. Most live vaccines have not been demonstrated to be secreted in human milk. Therefore, varicella vaccine may be considered for a nursing mother. 1 Except under research protocol Note: A prior history of chicken pox is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration Varicella vaccine may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, MMR, Hib, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis and PPSV23, Influenza, HPV, and MCV4 Tuberculin Skin Testing: While no data are available regarding the effect of varicella vaccination on tuberculin reactivity, it is prudent to apply the same precautions as with MMR when using the varicella vaccine. See guidelines for simultaneous tuberculin skin testing (TST) and the administration of live virus vaccines in the ACIP statement, \"General Recommendations on Immunization,\" MMWR, January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, RR-2, page 24. FIGURE 1: Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 0 through 6 years\u2014United States, 2012 (for those who fall behind or start late, see the catch-up schedule [Figure 3]) This schedule includes recommendations in effect as of December 23, 2011. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at a subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. The use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines. Vaccination providers should consult the relevant Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) statement for detailed recommendations, available online at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. Clinically significant adverse events that follow vaccination should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) online (http://www.vaers.hhs.gov) or by telephone (800-822-7967). 1. Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine. (Minimum age: birth) At birth: Administer monovalent HepB vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge. For infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers, administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after receiving the last dose of the series. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, within 12 hours of birth administer HepB vaccine for infants weighing 2,000 grams, and HepB vaccine plus HBIG for infants weighing <2,000 grams. Determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if she is HBsAg-positive, administer HBIG for infants weighing 2,000 grams (no later than age 1 week). Doses after the birth dose: The second dose should be administered at age 1 to 2 months. Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks. Administration of a total of 4 doses of HepB vaccine is permissible when a combination vaccine containing HepB is administered after the birth dose. Infants who did not receive a birth dose should receive 3 doses of a HepB-containing vaccine starting as soon as feasible (Figure 3). The minimum interval between dose 1 and dose 2 is 4 weeks, and between dose 2 and 3 is 8 weeks. The final (third or fourth) dose in the HepB vaccine series should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks and at least 16 weeks after the first dose. 2. Rotavirus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV-1 [Rotarix] and RV-5 [Rota Teq]) The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; and 8 months, 0 days for the final dose in the series. Vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days or older. If RV-1 (Rotarix) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at 6 months is not indicated. 3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 weeks) The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. 4. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 weeks) If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or Comvax [HepB-Hib]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not indicated. Hiberix should only be used for the booster (final) dose in children aged 12 months through 4 years. 5. Pneumococcal vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV]; 2 years for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV]) Administer 1 dose of PCV to all healthy children aged 24 through 59 months who are not completely vaccinated for their age. For children who have received an age-appropriate series of 7-valent PCV (PCV7), a single 13-valent PCV (PCV13) is recommended for: \u2014All children aged 14 through 59 months \u2014Children aged 60 through 71 months with underlying medical conditions. Administer PPSV at least 8 weeks after last dose of PCV to children aged 2 years or older with certain underlying medical conditions, including a cochlear implant. See MMWR 2010:59(No. RR-11), poliovirus vaccine (IPV). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) If 4 or more doses are administered before age 4 years, an additional dose should be administered at age 4 through 6 years. The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose.7. Influenza vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 months for trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [TIV]; 2 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) For most healthy children aged 2 years and older, either LAIV or TIV may be used. However, LAIV should not be administered to some children, including 1) children with asthma, 2) children 2 through 4 years who had wheezing in the past 12 months, or 3) children who have any other underlying medical conditions that predispose them to influenza complications. For all other contraindications to use of LAIV, see MMWR 2010;59(No. RR-8), available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5908.pdf. For children aged 6 months through 8 years: \u2014For the 2011-12 season, administer 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks) to those who did not receive at least 1 dose of the 2010-11 vaccine. Those who received at least 1 dose of the 2010-11 vaccine require 1 dose for the 2011-12 season. \u2014For the 2012-13 season, follow dosing guidelines in the 2012 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations. 8. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose. Administer MMR vaccine to infants aged 6 through 11 months who are traveling internationally. These children should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 through 15 months and at least 4 weeks after the previous dose, and the second at ages 4 through 6 years. 9. Varicella (VAR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the first dose. For children aged 12 months through 12 years, the recommended minimum interval between doses is 3 months. However, if the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid. 10. Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) Administer the second (final) dose 6 to18 months after the first. Unvaccinated children 24 months and older at high risk should be vaccinated. See MMWR 2006;55(No. RR-7), available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5507.pdf. A 2-dose HepA vaccine series is recommended for anyone aged 24 months and older, previously unvaccinated, for whom immunity against hepatitis A virus infection is desired. 11. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines, quadrivalent (MCV4). (Minimum age: [MCV4-D], 2 years for Menveo [MCV4-CRM]) For children aged 9 through 23 months 1) with persistent complement component deficiency; 2) who are residents of or travelers to countries with hyperendemic or epidemic disease; or 3) who are present during outbreaks caused by a vaccine serogroup, administer 2 primary doses of MCV4-D, ideally at ages 9 months and 12 months or at least 8 weeks apart. For children aged 24 months and older with 1) persistent complement component deficiency who have not been previously vaccinated; or 2) anatomic/functional asplenia, administer 2 primary doses of either MCV4 at least 8 weeks apart. For children with anatomic/functional asplenia, if MCV4-D (Menactra) is used, administer at a minimum age of 2 years and at least 4 weeks after completion of all PCV oses.

Rotavirus (RV) vaccines (RV-1 [Rotarix] and RV-5 [Rota Teq]). The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; and 8 months, 0 days for the final dose in the series. Vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days or older. If RV-1 was administered for the first and second doses, a third dose is not indicated. 2. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. The fifth dose is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older. 3. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine. Hib vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated persons aged 5 years or older who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or anatomic/functional asplenia. If the first 2 doses were PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or Comvax) and were administered at age 11 months or younger, the third (and final) dose should be administered at age 12 through 15 months and at least 8 weeks after the second dose. If the first dose was administered at age 7 through 11 months, administer the second dose at least 4 weeks later and a final dose at age 12 through 15 months. 4. Pneumococcal vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV]; 2 years for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV]) For children aged 24 through 71 months with underlying medical conditions, administer 1 dose of PCV if 3 doses of PCV were received previously, or administer 2 doses of PCV at least 8 weeks apart if fewer than 3 doses of PCV were received previously. A single dose of PCV may be administered to certain children aged 6 through 18 years with underlying medical conditions. See age-specific schedules for details. Administer PPSV to children aged 2 years or older with certain underlying medical conditions. See MMWR 2010:59(No. RR-11), available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5911.pdf. 5. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). A fourth dose is not necessary if the third dose was administered at age 4 years or older and at least 6 months after the previous dose. In the first 6 months of life, minimum age and minimum intervals are only recommended if the person is at risk for imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (i.e., travel to a polio-endemic region or during an outbreak). IPV is not routinely recommended for U.S. residents aged 18 years or older. 6. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines, quadrivalent (MCV4). (Minimum age: 2 years for Menveo [MCV4-CRM]) See Figure 1 (\"Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 0 through 6 years\") and Figure 2 (\"Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 7 through 18 years\") for further guidance. 7. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Administer the second dose routinely at age 4 through 6 years. 8. Varicella (VAR) vaccine. Administer the second dose routinely at age 4 through 6 years. If the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid. 9. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines. For children aged 7 through 10 years who are not fully immunized with the childhood DTaP vaccine series, Tdap vaccine should be substituted for a single dose of Td vaccine in the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For these children, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose should not be given. An inadvertent dose of DTaP vaccine administered to children aged 7 through 10 years can count as part of the catch-up series. This dose can count as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive a Tdap booster dose at age 11-12 years. 10. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (HPV4 [Gardasil] and HPV2 [Cervarix]). Administer the vaccine series to females (either HPV2 or HPV4) and males (HPV4) at age 13 through 18 years if patient is not previously vaccinated. Use recommended routine dosing intervals for vaccine series catch-up; see Figure 2 (\"Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 7 through 18 years\"). Clinically significant adverse events that follow vaccination should be reported to the V accine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) online ( http://www.vaers.hhs.gov) or by telephone ( 800-822-7967 ). Suspected cases of vaccine-preventable diseases should be reported to the state or local health department.

Use of licensed combination vaccines is generally preferred to separate injections of the ir equivalent component vaccines. When administering combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest age f or any of the individual components; the minimum interval between do ses is equal to the greatest interval of any of the individu al components. 2 Information on travel vaccines including typhoid, Japanese encep halitis, and yellow fever, is available at www.cdc.gov/travel . Information on other vaccines that are licensed in the US but not distributed, including anthrax and smallpox, is available at www.bt.cdc.gov. 3 Combination vaccines containing a hepatitis B component (Comvax, Pediarix, and Twinrix) are available. These vaccines should not be administered to infants younger than 6 weeks becaus e of the other components (i.e., Hib, DTaP, HepA, and IPV). 4 HepB-3 should be administered at least 8 weeks after HepB -2 and at least 16 weeks after HepB-1, and should not be administered before age 24 weeks. 5 Calendar months. 5 The minimum recommended interval between DTaP-3 and DTaP-4 is 6 months. However, DTaP-4 need not be repeated if administered at least 4 months after DTaP-3. 7 Children receiving the first dose of Hib or PCV vaccine at age 7 months or older require fewer doses to complete the series. 8 If PRP-OMP (Pedvax-Hib) was administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. 9 A fourth dose is not needed if the third dose was administered on or after the 4 th birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. 10 Combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine can be used for children aged 12 months through 12 years. (See CDC. General recommendations on Immuniza tion: recommendations of the ACIP. MMWR 2011;60[No. RR-2],7.) 11 For persons beginning the series on or after the 13th birthday, the minimum inte rval from varicella-1 to varicella-2 is 4 weeks. 12 One dose of influenza vaccine per season is recommended for most people. Children younger than 9 years of age who are receiv ing influenza vaccine for the first time should receive 2 doses this season. See current influenza recommendations for other factor s affecting the decision to administer one vs. two doses to children younger than 9 years. 13 The minimum age for inactivated influenza vaccine varies by vaccine manufacturer and formulation. See package inserts for va ccine- specific minimum ages. 14 Revaccination with meningococcal vaccine is recommended for previously vaccinated persons who remain at high risk for meningococcal disease. (See CDC. Updated re commendations from the ACIP for vaccinati on of persons at prolonged increased risk for meningococcal disease. MMWR 2009;58:[1042-3]) 15 Menactra may be given as young as 9 months for high-risk children. 16 Only one dose of Tdap is recommended. Subsequent doses should be given as Td. For one brand of Tdap (Adacel), the minimum age is 11 years. For management of a tetanus-prone wound in a person who has received a primary series of a tetanus-toxoid containing vaccine, there is no minimum interval between a previous dose of any tetanus-containing vaccine and Tdap. 17 A second dose of PPSV 5 years after the first dose is recomm ended for persons <65 years of age at highest risk for serious pneumococcal infection, and for those who are likely to have a rapid decline in pneumococcal antibody concentration. (See CDC . Prevention of pneumococcal HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is approved for females 10 th rough 25 years of age. Quadraval ent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) is approved for males and females 9 through 26 years of age. 19 The minimum age for HPV-3 is based on the baseline minimum age fo r the first dose (108 months) and the minimum interval of 2 4 weeks between the first and third doses. Dose 3 need not be repeat ed if it is given at least 16 weeks after the first dose (an d if the intervals between doses 1 and 2 and doses 2 and 3 are ma intained at 4 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively). 20 The first dose of rotavirus must be administered between 6 weeks 0 days and 14 weeks 6 days. The vaccine series should not b e started after age 15 weeks 0 days. Rotavirus should not be administered to children older than 8 months 0 days, regardless of the number of doses received before that age. 21 If two doses of Rotarix are administered as age appropriate, a third dose is not necessary. 22 Herpes zoster vaccine is recommended as a si ngle dose for persons 60 years of age and older.

Concentrations of measles antibody in an IG preparation can vary by manufacturer's lot. Rates of antibody cl earance after receipt of an IG preparation also might vary. Recommended intervals are extrapolated from an estimated half-life of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observ ed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine f or 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg. 1 Does not include zoster vaccine. Zoster vaccine ma y be given with antibody-containing blood products. 2 Assumes a serum IgG concentration of 16 mg/mL. 3 Measles and varicella vaccinations are recommended for children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic human immunodeficienc y virus (HIV) infection, but are contraindicated for persons with severe immunosuppression from HIV or any other immunosuppressive disorder. 4 The investigational product VariZIG, similar to licensed VZIG, is a purified human IG preparation made from plasma containing high levels of anti-varicella antibodies (IgG). The interval between VariZIG and varicella vaccine (Var or MMRV) is 5 months. 5 Contains antibody only to respiratory syncytial virus Adapted from Table 5, ACIP General Recommendations on Immuniza tion February 2012 Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule\u2014United States - 2012 Note: These recommendations must be read with the footnotes that follow containing number of doses, intervals between doses, and other important information.

Information on travel vaccine requirements and recommendations (e.g., for hepatitis A and B, meningococcal, and other vaccines) available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm. 2. Influenza vaccination Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons 6 months of age and older . Persons 6 months of age and older , including pregnant women, can receive the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). Healthy , nonpregnant adults younger than age 50 years without high-risk medical conditions can receive either intranasally administered live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (FluMist), or TIV. Health-care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons (i.e., those who require care in a protected environment) should receive TIV rather than LAIV. Other persons should receive TIV. The intramuscular or intradermal administered TIV are options for adults aged 18-64 years. Adults aged 65 years and older can receive the standard dose TIV or the high-dose TIV (Fluzone High-Dose). 3. T and (Td/Tdap) vaccination Administer a one-time dose of Tdap to adults younger than age 65 years who have not received Tdap previously or for whom vaccine status is unknown to replace one of the 10-year Td boosters. Tdap is specifically recommended for the following persons: \u2014pregnant women more than 20 weeks' gestation, \u2014adults, regardless of age, who are close contacts of infants younger than age 12 months (e.g., parents, grandparents, or child care providers), and \u2014health-care personnel. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the most recent tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccine. Pregnant women not vaccinated during pregnancy should receive Tdap immediately postpartum. Adults 65 years and older may receive Tdap. Adults with unknown or incomplete history of completing a 3-dose primary vaccination series with Td-containing vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series. Tdap should be substituted for a single dose of Td in the vaccination series with Tdap preferred as the first dose. For unvaccinated adults, administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. If incompletely vaccinated (i.e., less than 3 doses), administer remaining doses. Refer to the ACIP statement for recommendations for administering Td/Tdap as prophylaxis in wound management (See footnote 1). 4. V aricella vaccination All adults without evidence of immunity to varicella (as defined below) should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine or a second dose if they have received only 1 dose. Special consideration for vaccination should be given to those who \u2014have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (e.g., health-care personnel and family contacts of persons with immunocompromising conditions) or \u2014are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers; child care employees; residents and staf f members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions; college students; military personnel; adolescents and adults living in households with children; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; and international travelers). Pregnant women should be assessed for evidence of varicella immunity . W omen who do not have evidence of immunity should receive the first dose of varicella vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility . The second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first dose. Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following: \u2014documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine at least 4 weeks apart; \u2014U.S.-born before 1980 (although for health-care personnel and pregnant women, birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity); \u2014history of varicella based on diagnosis or verification of varicella by a health-care provider (for a patient reporting a history of or having an atypical case, a mild case, or both, health-care providers should seek either an epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case or to a Footnotes \u2014 Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule\u2014United States - 2012 7. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination (cont'd) Rubella component: For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year , rubella immunity should be determined. If there is no evidence of immunity, women who are not pregnant should be vaccinated. Pregnant women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. Health-care personnel born before 1957: For unvaccinated health-care personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps, and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should consider routinely vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval for measles and mumps or 1 dose of MMR vaccine for rubella. 8. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV) vaccination V accinate all persons with the following indications: \u2014age 65 years and older without a history of PPSV vaccination; \u2014adults younger than 65 years with chronic lung disease (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and asthma); chronic cardiovascular diseases; diabetes (e.g., sickle disease and other hemoglobinopathies, congenital acquired asplenia, splenic dysfunction, or splenectomy [if elective splenectomy is planned, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before surgery]); \u2014residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities; and \u2014adults who smoke cigarettes. Persons with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection should be vaccinated as soon as possible after their diagnosis. When cancer chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy is being considered, the interval between vaccination and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy should be at least 2 weeks. V accination during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided. Routine use of PPSV is not recommended for American Indians/Alaska Natives or other persons younger than 65 years of age unless they have underlying medical conditions that are PPSV indications. However, public health authorities may consider recommending PPSV for American Indians/Alaska Natives who are living in areas where the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease is increased. 9. Revaccination with PPSV One-time revaccination 5 years after the first dose is recommended for persons 19 through 64 years of age with chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy); and for persons with immunocompromising conditions. Persons who received PPSV before age 65 years for any indication should receive another dose of the vaccine at age 65 years or later if at least 5 years have passed since their previous dose. No further doses are needed for persons vaccinated with PPSV at or after age 65 years. 10. Meningococcal vaccination Administer 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine quadrivalent (MCV4) at least 2 months apart to adults with functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies. HIV -infected persons who are vaccinated should also receive 2 doses. Administer a single dose of meningococcal vaccine to microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis , military recruits, and persons who travel to or live in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic. First-year college students up through age 21 years who are living in residence halls should be vaccinated if they have not received a dose on or after their 16th birthday . MCV4 is preferred for adults with any of the preceding indications who are 55 years old and younger; meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is preferred for adults 56 years and older . Revaccination with MCV4 every 5 years is recommended for adults previously vaccinated with MCV4 or MPSV4 who remain at increased risk for infection (e.g., adults with anatomic or functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies). 1 1. Hepatitis A vaccination V accinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and persons with any of the following indications: \u2014men who have sex with men and persons who use injection drugs; laboratory-confirmed case or evidence of laboratory confirmation, if it was performed at the time of acute disease); \u2014history of herpes zoster based on diagnosis or herpes zoster by a health-care provider; or \u2014laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. 5. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination Two vaccines are licensed for use in females, bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) and quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4), and one HPV vaccine for use in males (HPV4). For females, either HPV4 or HPV2 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at 11 or 12 years of age, and for those 13 through 26 years of age, if not previously vaccinated. For males, HPV4 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at 1 1 or 12 years of age, and for those 13 through 21 years of age, if not previously vaccinated. Males 22 through 26 years of age may be vaccinated. HPV vaccines are not live vaccines and can be administered to persons who are immunocompromised as a result of infection (including HIV infection), disease, or medications. Vaccine is recommended for immunocompromised persons through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger . The immune response and vaccine efficacy might be less than that in immunocompetent persons. Men who have sex with men (MSM) might especially benefit from vaccination to prevent condyloma and anal cancer. HPV4 is recommended for MSM through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger . Ideally, vaccine should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual activity; however , persons who are sexually active should still be vaccinated consistent with age-based recommendations. HPV vaccine can be administered to persons with a history of genital warts, abnormal Papanicolaou test, or positive HPV DNA test. A complete series for either HPV4 or HPV2 consists of 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 1-2 months after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose (at least 24 weeks after the first dose). Although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for health-care personnel (HCP) based on their occupation, HCP should receive the HPV vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. 6. Zoster vaccination A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older regardless of whether they report a prior episode of herpes zoster . Although the vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use among and can be administered to persons 50 years and older, ACIP recommends that vaccination begins at 60 years of age. Persons with chronic medical conditions may be vaccinated unless their condition constitutes a contraindication, such as pregnancy or severe immunodeficiency. Although zoster vaccination is not specifically recommended for health-care personnel (HCP), HCP should receive the vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. 7. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination Adults born before 1957 generally are considered immune to measles and mumps. All adults born in 1957 or later should have documentation of 1 or more doses of MMR vaccine unless they have a medical contraindication to the vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases, or documentation of provider-diagnosed measles or mumps disease. For rubella, documentation of provider-diagnosed disease is not considered acceptable evidence of immunity. Measles component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who \u2014are students in postsecondary educational institutions; \u2014work in a health-care facility; or \u2014plan to travel internationally. Persons who received inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type from 1963 to 1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Mumps component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who \u2014are students in postsecondary educational institutions; \u2014work in a health-care facility; or \u2014plan to travel internationally. Persons vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk for mumps infection (e.g., persons who are working in a health-care facility) should be considered for revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. \u2014persons working with HAV -infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; \u2014persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates; \u2014persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and \u2014unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity. (See footnote 1 for more information on travel recommendations). The first dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6-12 months (Havrix), or 0 and 6-18 months (Vaqta). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30 followed by a booster dose at month 12. 12. Hepatitis B vaccination Vaccinate persons with any of the following indications and any person seeking protection from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: \u2014sexually active persons who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (e.g., persons with more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months); persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD); current or recent injection-drug users; and men who have sex with men; \u2014health-care personnel and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids; \u2014persons with diabetes younger than 60 years as soon as feasible after diagnosis; persons with diabetes who are 60 years or older at the discretion of the treating clinician based on increased need for assisted blood glucose monitoring in long-term care facilities, likelihood of acquiring hepatitis B infection, its complications or chronic sequelae, and likelihood of immune response to vaccination; \u2014persons with end-stage renal disease, including patients receiving hemodialysis; persons with HIV infection; and persons with chronic liver disease; \u2014household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection; clients and staff members of institutions for persons with developmental disabilities; and international travelers to countries with high or intermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection; and \u2014all adults in the following settings: STD treatment facilities; HIV testing and treatment facilities; facilities providing drug-abuse treatment and prevention services; health-care settings targeting services to injection-drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; end-stage renal disease programs and facilities for chronic hemodialysis patients; and institutions and nonresidential daycare facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. Administer missing doses to complete a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine to those persons not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated. The second dose should be administered 1 month after the first dose; the third dose should be given at least 2 months after the second dose (and at least 4 months after the first dose). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, give 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose Twinrix schedule, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30 followed by a booster dose at month 12 may be used. Adult patients receiving hemodialysis or with other immunocompromising conditions should receive 1 dose of 40 g/mL (Recombivax HB) administered on a 3-dose schedule or 2 doses of 20 g/mL (Engerix-B) administered simultaneously on a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. 13. Selected conditions for which Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine may be used 1 dose of Hib vaccine should be considered for persons who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV infection, or who have anatomic or functional asplenia if they have not previously received Hib vaccine. 14. Immunocompromising conditions Inactivated vaccines generally are acceptable (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, and influenza [inactivated influenza vaccine]), and live vaccines generally are avoided in persons with immune deficiencies or immunocompromising conditions. Information on specific conditions is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm .GENERAL RECOMMENDTIONS APPLYING TO SPACING AND ADMINISTRATION OF ROUTINELY RECOMMENDED CHILDHOOD VACCINES 1) Simultaneous administration. This recommendation states that there are no contraindications to the simultaneous administration of any of the routinely recommended vaccines included on the current ACIP schedule. The only exception to this rule is that PCV and PPSV should be separated by 8 weeks. 2) No minimum time intervals between the administration of 2 different inactivated vaccines. For example, you could give a DTaP one day and a HIB the next, or 2 weeks later. Again, the one exception is for doses of PCV and PPSV . 3) If 2 different live virus vaccines are not administered on the same day, they must be separated by at least 4 weeks. This would apply specifically to doses of MMR and varicella, if not administered on the same day. 4) If 2 different live injectable vaccines are given <28 days apart, the one given second should be repeated 28 days after the second or invalid dose. 5) This recommendation states that vaccine doses should not be given at intervals less than the minimum intervals or earlier than the minimum age. Table 1 of the General Recommendations gives all the minimum intervals and ages for each dose of the recommended childhood vaccines. 6) The 4 day grace period In 2002 the ACIP instituted what is referred to as the grace period, for use in evaluating immunization records. Basically, it states that doses given 4 days before the minimum age or interval may be counted as valid doses. The exception to this is in regard to the spacing of doses of MMR and varicella. This rule should be used primarily for evaluating records, NOT for scheduling visits. In Georgia, this rule does not conflict with the requirements for school and day care. This is not true in some states. 7) If vaccines are administered later than the recommended schedule : Do not start over Do not repeat doses Continue with the rest of the series according to recommended intervals and ages. 8) The importance of administering vaccines by the recommended routes and sites. It does, however, state that in evaluating records, all doses given by nonstandard routes and sites may be accepted except: Rabies and hepatitis B given in the gluteus Hepatitis B not given IM Continue to discard and repeat vaccines given in \"divided doses\" Do not mix vaccines unless they are licensed to be mixed. 9) Combination vaccines may be used whenever any components of the combination are indicated AND its other components are not contraindicated. The manufacturers' package insert should be consulted for further information. 10 Contraindications and precautions are circumstances that dictate when vaccines should not be administered. A contraindication is a condition in the recipient that increases the risk for a serious adverse reaction. A precaution is a condition in the recipient that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction. In some circumstances it may be necessary to weigh benefits vs. risks, as in an outbreak. Because the majority of contraindications and precautions are temporary, vaccines often can be given later if one or more exist . Screening Checklist for Contraindications to Vaccines for Children and Teens For parents/guardians: The following questions will help us determine which vaccines your child may be given today. If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. 1. Is the child sick today? 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems? 8. Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treatments? 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Ave. (mo.) (day) (yr.) Did you bring your child's immunization record card with you? yes no It is important to have a personal record of your child's vaccinations. If you don't have one, ask the child's healthcare provider to give you one with all your child's vaccinations on it. Keep it in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical care for your child. Your child will need this document to enter day care or school, for employment, or for international travel.

Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup- pression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be considered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive LAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6). 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant individuals age 2-49 years. 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, MMR, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the cur - rent Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines (1, 2). 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? [LAIV, MMR, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus (1, 6). Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of the vac - cine (5, 8). On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent (e.g., travel to endemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not contra - indicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be administered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester (9). 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever] If the child was given either live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vac - cines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval. References: 1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization, at www.cdc.gov/va ccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. 2. AAP.

If so, read the information below. If you want to find out even more, consult the references listed at the bottom of this page. Immunization Action Coalition Item #P4060 p. 2 1. Is the child sick today? [all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1, 2). However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute ill - ness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] If a person reports they have an allergy to egg, ask if they can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled eggs). If they can, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) may be admin- istered. If after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, they have a reaction consisting of only hives, TIV may be given and the person should be observed for at least 30 minutes. If a person experiences a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives and either swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eating eggs, do not administer TIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). It is possible that they may be eligible to be given TIV, but only after they have seen a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions. If a person has ana - phylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer LAIV, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), MMR+varicella (MMRV), or varicella vaccine. A local reaction is not a contraindication. For a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc. gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. For an extensive table of vaccine components, see reference 3. 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). His - tory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac - cines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid- ney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV] Children with any of the health conditions listed above should not be given the intrana - sal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). These children should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the inactivated influenza vaccine. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurolog - ic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap, and a progressive neurologic disorder in a teen is a precaution to the use of Td. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual (exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn - drome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no 1. \u00bfEst\u00e1 enfermo en terapia de aspirina a largo plazo? 5.

Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup- pression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be considered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive LAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6). 9.

His - tory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac - cines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid- ney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV] Children with any of the health conditions listed above should not be given the intrana - sal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). These children should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the inactivated influenza vaccine. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurolog - ic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap, and a progressive neurologic disorder in a teen is a precaution to the use of Td. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual (exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn - drome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no Did you bring your immunization record card with you? yes no It is important for you to have a personal record of your vaccinations. If you don't have a personal record, ask your healthcare provider to give you one. Keep this record in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical care. Make sure your healthcare provider records all your vaccinations on it. 1. Are you sick today? 2. Do you have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Have you ever had a serious reaction after receiving a vaccination? 4. Do you have a long-term health problem with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, kidney disease, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), anemia, or other blood disorder? 5. Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? 6. In the past 3 months, have you taken medications that weaken your immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or have you had radiation treatments? 7. Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? 8. During the past year, have you received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? 9. For women: Are you pregnant or is there a chance you could become pregnant during the next month? 10. Have you received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? Patient name: Date of birth: (mo.)

LAIV can be given only to healthy non- pregnant people younger than age 50 years. 7. Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? [influenza, Td/Tdap] Tdap is contraindicated in people who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP given before age 7 years. An unstable progressive neurologic problem is a precaution to the use of Tdap. For people with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vac - cination, or for people with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual. A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the follow - ing: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap; 2) Influenza vaccine (TIV/LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine, vaccinate with TIV if at high risk for severe influenza complications. 8. During the past year, have you received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, VAR] Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommen-dations for current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines. (1) 9. For women: Are you pregnant or is there a chance you could become pregnant during the next month? [MMR, LAIV, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. Sexually active women in their childbearing years who receive live virus vaccines should be instructed to practice careful con-traception for one month following receipt of the vaccine. On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent and immediate pro-tection is needed (e.g., travel to endemic areas). Use of Td or Tdap is not contraindicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be administered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester. (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) 10. Have you received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, yellow fever] If the person to be vaccinated was given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vaccines may be given at any spacing interval if they are not administered simultaneously. References: 1. CDC.

[all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1). However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has im-proved. Mild illnesses (such as upper respiratory infections or diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Do you have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] If a person reports they have an allergy to egg, ask if they can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled eggs). If they can, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) may be administered. If after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, they have a reaction consisting of only hives, TIV may be given and the person should be observed for at least 30 minutes. If a person experiences a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives and either swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eating eggs, do not administer TIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). It is possible that they may be eligible to be given TIV, but only after they have seen a physi-cian with expertise in the management of allergic conditions. If a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer MMR or varicella vaccine. Local reactions are not contraindications. For a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf.

Do you have a long-term health problem with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, kidney disease, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), anemia, or other blood disorder? [LAIV] People with any of these health conditions should not be given the intra- nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Instead, they should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other im - mune system problem? [LAIV, people. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR vaccine is recommended and varicella vaccine should be considered for adults with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immu- nosuppressed people should not receive LAIV. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (3, 4, 5). 6. In the past 3 months, have you taken medications that weak - en your immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or have you had radiation treat- ments? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1, 5).

In 1992, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), in collaboration with the Ad Hoc Work- ing Group for the Development of Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices, a working grouprepresenting public and private agencies with inputfrom state and local health departments, physicianand nursing organizations, and public and privateproviders, developed a set of standards as to whatconstitutes the most essential and desirable immuni-zation policies and practices. These standards wereendorsed by a variety of medical and public healthorganizations and represented an important elementin our national strategy to protect America's childrenagainst vaccine-preventable diseases. Since that time, vaccine delivery in the United States has changed in several important ways. First,vaccination coverage rates among preschool childrenhave increased substantially and are now monitoredby the National Immunization Survey. 1,2Second, vaccination of children has shifted markedly fromthe public to the private sector, 3-5with an emphasis on vaccination in the context of primary care and themedical home. 6The Vaccines for Children Program has provided critical support to this shift by coveringthe cost of vaccines for the most economically disad-vantaged children and adolescents. Third, the devel-opment and introduction of performance measures,such as the National Committee for Quality Assur-ance's Health Plan Employer Data and InformationSet, 7have focused national attention on the quality of preventive care, including vaccination. Finally, high-quality research in health services has helped to re-fine strategies for raising and sustaining vaccinationcoverage levels among children, adolescents, andadults. 8 Health care professionals who vaccinate children and adolescents continue to face important chal-lenges. These challenges include a diminishing level of experience\u2014among patients, parents, and physi-cians\u2014with the diseases that vaccines prevent, theready availability of vaccine-related information thatmay be inaccurate or misleading, the increasing com-plexity of the vaccination schedule, and the failure ofmany health plans to pay for the costs associatedwith vaccination. In addition, recommendationsfrom the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediat-rics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physi-cians (AAFP), and the American Medical Associationin 1996 underscored the need to focus on adolescentvaccination. 9 In this context, NVAC, along with partners repre- senting the federal agencies, state and local healthdepartments, and professional organizations, revisedand updated the standards during 2001-2002 to re-flect these changes and challenges in vaccine deliv-ery. The revision was approved by NVAC on Febru-ary 8, 2002 (Table 1), and distributed widely amonga variety of medical and public health organizationsfor review and endorsement. Table 2 lists those or-ganizations that have formally endorsed the Stan-dards for Child and Adolescent Immunization Prac-tices. The standards are directed toward \"health care professionals,\" an inclusive term for the many peo-ple in clinical settings who share in the responsibilityfor vaccination of children and adolescents: physi-cians, nurses, midlevel practitioners (eg, nurse prac- titioners, physician assistants), medical assistants,and clerical staff. In addition to this primary audi-ence, the standards are intended to be useful to pub-lic health professionals, policy makers, health planadministrators, employers who purchase health carecoverage, and others whose efforts shape and sup-port the delivery of vaccination services. Of note, the use of the term \"standards\" should not be confused with a minimum standard of care.Rather, these standards represent the most desirableimmunization practices, which health care profes-sionals should strive to achieve. Given current re-source limitations, some health care professionalsmay find it difficult to implement all of the stan-dards, because of circumstances over which theyhave little control. The expectation is that, by sum-marizing best immunization practices in a clear andconcise format, the standards will assist these pro-viders in securing the resources necessary to imple-ment this set of recommendations.

Achieving these objectives will improve thehealth and welfare of all children and adolescents aswell as the communities in which they live. THE STANDARDS Availability of Vaccines 1. Vaccination Services Are Readily Available All health care professionals who provide primary care to children and adolescents should always in- clude routinely recommended vaccines as a part ofthe care that they deliver in the medical home. 6For some children and adolescents, the main contactwith the health care system is not in a primary careprovider's office; therefore, opportunities for vacci- nation may be missed. Thus, specialists and healthcare professionals in settings such as schools andschool health clinics, sports physical clinics, familyplanning clinics, sexually transmitted disease clinics,and substance abuse treatment centers should assesseach patient's vaccination status and either offer in-dicated vaccines or refer for vaccination if necessary.Information on vaccines administered outside theprimary care setting should be communicated to theprimary care provider.2. Vaccinations Are Coordinated With Other Health Care Services and Provided in a Medical Home When Possible Ideally, vaccines should be given as part of com- prehensive health care. In primary care settings, vac- cination services should be coordinated with routinewell-care visits and other visits. 6Patients who are vaccinated in other settings should be encouraged toreceive subsequent vaccines in their primary caresetting. Patients without a primary care providershould be assisted with identifying one. 3. Barriers to Vaccination Are Identified and Minimized Barriers to receiving vaccines include delays in scheduling appointments, requiring a well-care visit,long waiting periods in the office, and lack of cultur-ally and age-appropriate educational materials. Aphysical examination, although an important part ofwell care, should not be required before administer-ing vaccines: simply observing the patient and ques-tioning about the patient 's health status, immuniza- tion history, and vaccine contraindications aresufficient. In addition, vaccination-only visits shouldbe available. Health care professionals should seekadvice from parents/guardians and patients to iden-tify ways to make vaccination services easier to use. 4. Patient Costs Are Minimized Out-of-pocket costs \u2014including vaccine, adminis- tration, and office visit fees \u2014should be as low as possible for all patients, and no child or adolescentshould be denied vaccination because of inability topay. Resources should be identified to keep patientvaccination costs as low as possible. Free vaccine isTABLE 1. Standards for Child and Adolescent Immunization Practices Availability of vaccines 1.

ARTICLES 959 at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from available through some public programs, although health care professionals who offer these vaccinesmay charge a reasonable administration fee. Sourcesof publicly funded vaccines include the Vaccines forChildren Program (VFC), Public Health Service Sec-tion 317 grants to states, and state or local programs.Children and adolescents should be screened fortheir eligibility to receive vaccines through these pro-grams. Vaccinations provided through VFC or Sec-tion 317 grants may not be denied because of aninability to pay the administration fee, and healthcare professionals should ensure that parents/guardians and patients are aware of this requirement(applies to all vaccines purchased using Centers forDisease Control and Prevention [CDC] contracts, re-gardless of the setting\u2014private or public\u2014in which the vaccines are administered). To minimize costs for patients, health plans and insurance plans should include the provision andadministration of all routinely recommended vac-cines as a covered benefit for all children and ado-lescents. Furthermore, to minimize costs for healthcare professionals, purchasers and health plansshould reimburse health care professionals ade-quately for delivering vaccines, including the timerequired for vaccine administration and for commu-nication about vaccine benefits and risks. The CDCmaintains a web page about VFC at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vfc. Assessment of Vaccination Status 5. Health Care Professionals Review the Vaccination and Health Status of Patients at Every Encounter to DetermineWhich Vaccines Are Indicated Health care professionals should review the vacci- nation status of all patients at all health care visits to minimize the number of missed opportunities to vac-cinate. This review should determine whether thepatient has received any vaccinations elsewhere or isat high risk for disease or undervaccination. Thisinformation should be documented in the patient 's chart and preventive health summary. Health careprofessionals who do not offer vaccinations shouldrefer patients to a primary care provider for neededvaccinations. 6. Health Care Professionals Assess for and Follow Only Medically Accepted Contraindications Withholding vaccinations because of medical con- cerns that are not contraindications results in missed opportunities for prevention. Health care profession-als should ask about any condition or circumstancethat might indicate that a vaccination should bewithheld or delayed and about previous adverseevents temporally associated with any vaccination.Health care professionals should support their deci-sions about what constitutes a contraindication ordeferral for each vaccine by consulting the Guideto Contraindications published bythe the AAFP(available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/child-schedule.htm#Printable); the AAP 'sRed Book and other Informa-tion Statements; and manufacturers 'package inserts. Contraindications and deferrals should be docu-mented in the medical record. Effective Communication About Vaccine Benefits and Risks 7. Parents/Guardians and Patients Are Educated About the Benefits and Risks of Vaccination in a Culturally AppropriateManner and in Easy-to-Understand Language Health care professionals should allow sufficient time with parents/guardians and adolescent patients to discuss the benefits of vaccines, the diseases thatthey prevent, any known risks from vaccines, theimmunization schedule and the need to receive vac-cines at the recommended ages, and the importanceof bringing the patient 's hand-held vaccination record to each health care visit. Health care profes-sionals should encourage parents/guardians and ad-olescent patients to take responsibility for ensuringthat the patient is fully vaccinated. For all commonly used childhood vaccines, allTABLE 2.

A VIS is a vaccine-specific, 2-page informationsheet, produced by the CDC, that describes the ben-efits and risks of a vaccine. If necessary, health careprofessionals should supplement the VIS with oralexplanations or other written materials that are cul-turally and linguistically appropriate. Health careprofessionals should review written materials withpatients and their parents/guardians and addressquestions and concerns. Health care professionals should encourage par- ents/guardians and adolescent patients to inform thehealth care professional of adverse events after thevaccine to be administered and explain how to ob-tain medical care, if necessary. (See Standard 13 for adescription of the Vaccine Adverse Events ReportingSystem [VAERS]). General vaccination information for health care professionals, parents, and members of the publicmay be obtained by calling the CDC National Immu-nization Information Hotline at 1-800-232-2522 (En-glish) or 1-800-232-0233 (Spanish). Information aboutvaccine risk communication for health care profes-sionals can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/research/peds.htm and in the latest editionof the Red Book. VISs are available in English and numerous other languages from state health depart-ments and at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/VIS/default.htm and http://www.immunize.org.Recommendations for national standards for cultur-ally and linguistically appropriate services in healthcare may be found at http://www.omhrc.gov/omh/programs/2pgprograms/finalreport.pdf. Proper Storage and Administration of Vaccines and Documentation of Vaccinations 8. Health Care Professionals Follow Appropriate Procedures for Vaccine Storage and Handling Vaccines should be handled and stored as recom- mended in the manufacturers 'package inserts; the expiration date for each vaccine should be noted. Temperatures at which vaccines are stored andtransported should be monitored and recorded twicedaily. Summary information about vaccine storageand handling procedures are also available fromstate and local health departments and the CDC.Health care professionals should monitor vaccineinventory and undertake efforts to reduce wastageand loss. CDC-recommended storage and handlingprocedures are available from the CDC by calling404-639-8222. 9. Up-to-Date, Written Vaccination Protocols Are Accessible at All Locations Where Vaccines Are Administered To promote the safe and effective use of vaccines, health care professionals should maintain written protocols that detail the following: vaccine storageand handling; the recommended vaccination sched-ule, vaccine contraindications, and administrationtechniques; treatment and reporting of adverseevents; vaccine benefit and risk communication; andvaccination record maintenance and accessibility.These protocols should be consistent with estab-lished guidelines, reviewed frequently, and revisedas needed to ensure that they remain up-to-date. 10. People Who Administer Vaccines and Staff Who Manage or Support Vaccine Administration Are Knowledgeable andReceive Ongoing Education Health care professionals or others who adminis- ter vaccinations should be knowledgeable and re- ceive continuing education in vaccine storage andhandling; the recommended vaccine schedule, con-traindications, and administration techniques; treat-ment and reporting of adverse events; vaccine ben-efit and risk communication; and vaccination recordmaintenance and accessibility. With appropriatetraining and in accordance with state law/regula-tion/policy, people other than physicians and nursesmay administer vaccines. In addition, other staffshould receive training and continuing educationrelated to their specific roles and responsibilities thataffect vaccination services. The CDC sponsors distance-based training oppor- satellite broadcasts, web-based care professionals. Information about trainingis available at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/ed. 11. Health Care Professionals Simultaneously Administer as Many Indicated Vaccine Doses as Possible Administering vaccines simultaneously (at the same visit), in accordance with recommendations from the ACIP, the AAP, and the AAFP, is safe,effective and indicated. Although the immunizationschedule provides age flexibility for administeringcertain vaccine doses, simultaneous administrationdecreases the number of visits needed and the potentialfor missed doses and enables earlier protection. Whenindicated vaccines are not simultaneously adminis-tered, arrangements should be made for the patient 's earliest return to receive the needed vaccination(s). Ad-ditional information on the safety of simultaneous vac-cination may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/research/simultaneous.htm. 12. Vaccination Records for Patients Are Accurate, Complete, and Easily Accessible Vaccination records for patients should be re- corded on a standard form in an easily accessible location in the medical record to facilitate rapid re-view of vaccination status. Accurate record keepinghelps to ensure that only needed vaccinations aregiven. As required by federal law (42 US Code 300aa-25), health care professionals should ensure thatrecords contain the following information for eachvaccination: the date of administration, the vaccinemanufacturer and lot number, the signature and titleof the person administering the vaccine, and theaddress where the vaccine was given. Vaccine re-fusal should also be documented. The medical record maintained by the primary care provider should document all vaccines received,including those received at a specialist 's office or in another health care setting. When a health care pro- ARTICLES 961 at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from fessional who does not routinely care for a patient vaccinates that patient, the patient 's primary care provider should be informed. All vaccinations administered should be reported to state or local immunization registries, where avail-able, to ensure that each patient 's vaccination history remains accurate and complete. Registries also maybe useful for verifying the vaccination status of newpatients, determining which vaccines are needed at avisit, printing official records, and providing remind-ers and recalls to parents, guardians, and patients. Health care professionals should ensure that each patient has a hand-held vaccination record that doc-uments each vaccine received, including the date andthe name of the health care professional who admin-istered the vaccine. Health care professionals shouldencourage parents/guardians and adolescent pa-tients to bring the patient 's hand-held record to each health care visit so that it can be updated. The CDC maintains an Immunization Registry Clearinghouse. Information about this clearinghouseis available at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/registry/. 13. Health Care Professionals Report Adverse Events After Vaccination Promptly and Accurately to the Vaccine AdverseEvents Reporting System (VAERS) and Are Aware of aSeparate Program, the National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram (VICP) Health care professionals should promptly report all clinically significant adverse events after vaccina- tion to the VAERS even if the health care professionalis not certain that the vaccine caused the event.Health care professionals should document in detailthe adverse event in the patient 's medical record as soon as possible. Providers should be aware thatparents/guardians and patients may report toVAERS and that if they choose to do so, they areencouraged to seek the help of their health care pro-vider. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Pro- gram (VICP) is a no-fault system that compensatespeople of any age for injuries or conditions that mayhave been caused by a vaccine recommended by theCDC for routine use in children. Health care profes-sionals should be aware of the VICP to address ques-tions raised by parents/guardians and patients. Because VAERS and VICP are separate programs, a report of an event to VAERS does not result in thesubmission of a compensation claim to VICP. A briefdescription and contact information for both pro-grams is provided on each VIS for those vaccinescovered by the National Childhood Vaccine InjuryAct. Information about VAERS, as well as guidance about how to obtain and complete a VAERS form,can be found at http://www.vaers.org or by calling1-800-822-7967. Information about the VICP is avail-able at http://www.hrsa.gov/osp/vicp or by calling1-800-338-2382. 14. All Personnel Who Have Contact With Patients Are Appropriately Vaccinated Health care professionals and other personnel who have contact with patients should be appropriatelyvaccinated. Offices and clinics should have policies to review and maintain the vaccination status of staffand trainees. ACIP recommendations for vaccinatinghealth care workers are available at ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/publications/mmwr/rr/rr4618.pdf. Implementation of Strategies to Improve Vaccination Coverage 15. Systems Are Used to Remind Parents/Guardians, Patients, and Health Care Professionals When Vaccinations Are Dueand to Recall Those Who Are Overdue Evidence demonstrates that reminder/recall sys- tems improve vaccination coverage.11Patient re - minder/recall interventions inform individuals that they are due (reminder) or overdue (recall) for spe-cific vaccinations. Patient reminders/recalls can bemailed or communicated by telephone; an autodialersystem can be used to expedite telephone reminders.Patients who might be at high risk for not complyingwith medical recommendations, for example, thosewho have missed previous appointments, should re-ceive more intensive follow-up. Similarly, providerreminder/recall systems alert health care profession-als when vaccines are due or overdue. Noticesshould be placed in patient charts or communicatedto health care professionals by computer or othermeans. Immunization registries can facilitate auto-matic generation of reminder/recall notices. 16. Office- or Clinic-Based Patient Record Reviews and Vaccination Coverage Assessments Are Performed Annually Evidence shows that assessments are most effec- tive in improving vaccination coverage in a practice when they combine chart reviews to determine cov-erage with the provision of results to health careprofessionals and staff. 11Effective interventions also may incorporate incentives or compare performancewith a goal or a standard. Coverage should be as-sessed regularly so that reasons for low coverage inthe practice or in a subgroup of patients are iden-tified and addressed. For assistance in conductingvaccination coverage assessments, health care pro-fessionals should contact their state or local immu-nization program. 17. Health Care Professionals Practice Community-Based Approaches All health care professionals share in the respon- sibility to achieve the highest possible degree of com- munity protection against vaccine-preventable dis-eases. Immunization protects the entire communityas well as the individual. No community is optimallyprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases with-out high vaccination coverage. Therefore, health careprofessionals should consider the needs of the com-munity (especially underserved populations) as wellas those of their patients. Community-based ap-proaches may involve working with partners in thecommunity, including public health departments,managed care organizations, other service providerssuch as the US Department of Agriculture 's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, In-fants, and Children (WIC), advocacy groups, schools, 962 STANDARDS FOR IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from and service organizations to determine community needs and develop vaccination services that addressthese needs. NATIONAL VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (NVAC) The NVAC was chartered in 1988 to advise and make recom- mendations to the director of the National Vaccine Program and the assistant secretary for health, Department of Health and Hu-man Services, on matters related to the prevention of infectiousdiseases through immunization and the prevention of adversereactions to vaccines. The NVAC is composed of 15 members frompublic and private organizations representing vaccine manufac-turers, physicians, parents, and state and local health agencies.

Informed Request Policy - 2/2012 Informed Request Policy 1INFORMED RE QUEST POLICY As providers of immunizations, it is important to furnish the vaccinee (or the parents/legal guardians of minors) with objective information on vaccine safety and the disease that the vaccine protects against, thereby making them active participants in decisions affecting their health or the health of their children. Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) are standardized to provide objective information about vaccine benefits and adverse events. What are VISs? VISs are developed by the staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and undergo intense scrutiny by panels of experts for accuracy. Each VIS provides information to properly inform the adult vaccinee or, in the case of a minor, the child's parent or legal representative about the risks and benefits of each vaccine. VISs are not meant to replace interactions with health care providers who should attempt to answer questions and address concerns that the vaccinee or the parent/guardian may have. VIS use is mandatory! Before a health care provider (public or privat e) vaccinates a child or adult with a dose of any recommended childhood vaccine (DTaP, Td, Tdap, MMR, Varicella, Polio, conjugate, meningococcal (conjugate and polysaccharide), hepatitis A, and influenza), t he provider is required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to provide the most current copy of the VIS to either the adult vaccinee or the child's parent/legal guardian. If there is not a single VIS for a combination vaccine (e.g., Hib/hepatitis B), use the VISs for all the component vaccines. A VIS is also available for the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Its use is not required by the National Childhood Injury Act, but is strongly encouraged-------and it must be used when giving vaccines purchased through a CDC contract (i.e. VFC vaccines). State or local health departments or individual providers may place identifiers (such as form numbers) on the VISs but any other changes must be approved by CDC's National Immunization Program. What to do with the VISs: Some of the legal requirements concerning the use of VISs are as follows: 1) Before a routine vaccine is administered to anyone (including adults), you must give the patient or the parent/guardian a copy of the most current VIS available for that vaccine. Make sure you give your patient time to read the VIS prior to the administration of the vaccine and review the VIS with them. 2) Record on your patient's chart which VIS was given and the date that it was given. 3) Record on the patient's chart the publication date of the VIS (a date which appears on the lower right hand corner of the VIS). How to get VISs: VISs are available upon request from the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) and the Georgia Immunization Office. (See order form 3184, included in Section 1 of this manual). English and translated statements may also be downloaded from the following websites: Centers for Disease Control (CDC) www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/vis Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) www.immunize.org/vis GA Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 3. Informed Request Policy - 2/2012 Informed Request Policy 2INFORMED RE QUEST POLICY Physician offices will be provided with a single copy for duplication. Please go to the Immunization Action Coalition website at www.immunize.org/vis for most recent VIS in English and other languages. Required Documentation : Georgia law requires that vaccines administered to individuals of all ages must be documented in the Georgia Registry of Immuni zation Transactions and Services (GRITS). This legal requirement is referenced in the \"Requirements of Law\" section of the Immunization Office Manual under the Official Code of Georgia. Written documentation is required in the vaccine recipient's medical record (or in a permanent office file or log) of each immunization and the receipt by vaccine recipients (or their parents or legal representatives) of the appropriate VIS. The documentation shall consist of the following: vaccine administration date vaccine manufacturer and lot number name, title, and address of the person administering the vaccine (i.e., address where the medical record will be maintained) which VIS is given date printed on the appropriate VIS date the VIS was given to the vaccine recipient (or the parent/legal guardian) date vaccine was given, appropriate notation of the preparation given and date of administration should be provided on either an existing or newly issued Personal Immunization Record It is recommended that Form 3199/3196, \"After the Shots\", or an equivalent description of common side effects be given to the patient or parent/guardian, along with a telephone number that may be called in the case of adverse events. A copy of form 3199/3196 is included in this section of the manual. It is also recommended that each vaccine be recorded on a client's personal immunization record. Personal Immunization Records (Form 3187 [English and Spanish]) may be ordered from the GA Immunization Office utilizing form 3184, the Request for Immunization Forms (see section 1). In addition, GRITS may be utilized to document an immunization record and can print out the clients' immunization history. VISs are not consent forms. In Georgia, the legal definition of a person authorized to make a request for immunization is very broad.

They can be downloaded as a .pdf file and printed. \u00be http://www.cdc.gov/vaccin es/pubs/vis/default.htm \u00be VISs in English and diffe rent languages can be found at http://www.immunize.org/vis/ After the Shot s... Your child may need extra love and care after getting vaccinated. Some vaccinations that protect children from serious diseases also can cause discomfort for a while. Here are answers to questions many parents have after their children have been vac\u00ad cinated. If this sheet doesn't answer your questions, call your healthcare provider.

What should I do? Check your child's temperature to find out if there is a fever. An easy way to do this is by taking a temperature in the armpit using an electronic ther - mometer (or by using the method of temperature-taking your healthcare provider recommends). If your child has a temperature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Here are some things you can do to help reduce fever: n Give your child plenty to drink. n Dress your child lightly. Do not cover or wrap your child tightly. n Give your child a fever- or pain-reducing medicine such as acetamino - phen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin). The dose you give your child should be based on your child's weight and your heathcare provider's instructions. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. Recheck your child's temperature after 1 hour. Call your healthcare provider if you have questions. My child has been fussy since getting vaccinated. What should I do? After vaccination, children may be fussy because of pain or fever. To reduce discomfort, you may want to give your child a medicine such as acetami n- ophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. If your child is fussy for more than 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child's leg or arm is swollen, hot, and red. What should I do? n Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the sore area for comfort. n For pain, give a medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. n If the redness or tenderness increases after 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child seems really sick. Should I call my healthcare provider? If you are worried at all about how your child looks or feels, call your health - care provider! healthcare provider: please fill in the information below. If your child's temperature is \u00b0F or \u00b0C or higher, or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Healthcare provider phone number:[ ]Call your healthcare provider right away if you answer \"yes\" to any of the following questions: Does your child have a temper- ature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about? Is your child pale or limp? Has your child been crying for more than 3 hours and just won't quit? Is your child's body shaking, twitching, or jerking? Is your child very noticeably less active or responsive? Please see page 2 for information on the proper amount of medicine to give your child to reduce pain or fever. s page 1 of 2 child's weight child's infants' drops or children's liquid children's junior age 80 mg in each o.8 mL 160 mg in each 5 mL ( 1 tsp) chewables strength Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. 80 mg in each tab 160 mg in each tab 6-11 lbs (2.7-5 kg) 0-3 mos Advised dose* lbs (5.5-7.7 kg) 4-11 mos Advised dose* 12 teaspoon or 2.5 mL 18-23 lbs (8.2-10.5 kg) 12-23 mos Advised dose* 34 teaspoon or 3.75 mL 24-35 lbs (10.9-15.9 kg) 2-3 yrs 1.6 mL (0.8 mL +0.8 mL) 1 teaspoon or 5 mL 2 tablets 36-47 lbs (16.4-21.4 kg) 4-5 yrs 112 teaspoon or 7.5 mL 3 tablets 48-59 lbs (21.8-26.8 kg) 6-8 yrs 2 teaspoons or 10 mL 4 tablets 2 tablets 60-71 lbs (27.3-32.3 kg) 9-10 yrs 212 teaspoons or 12.5 mL 5 tablets 212 tablets 72-95 lbs (32.7-43.2 kg) 11 yrs 3 teaspoons or 15 mL 6 tablets 3 tablets child's weight child's infants' drops children's liquid children's age 50 mg in each 1.25 mL 100 mg in each 5 mL (1 tsp) chewables Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. 50 mg in each tab 100 mg in each tab less than 11 lbs (5 kg) 0-5 mos 12-17 lbs (5.5-7.7 kg) 6-11 mos 1.25 mL Advised dose* 18-23 lbs (8.2-10.5 kg) 12-23 mos 1.875 mL Advised dose* 24-35 lbs (10.9-15.9 kg) 2-3 yrs 1 teaspoon or 5 mL 2 tablets 1 tablet 36-47 lbs (16.4-21.4 kg) 4-5 yrs 112 teaspoon or 7.5 mL 3 tablets 112 tablets 48-59 lbs (21.8-26.8 kg) 6-8 yrs 2 teaspoons or 10 mL 4 tablets 2 tablets 60-71 lbs (27.3-32.3 kg) 9-10 yrs 212 teaspoons or 12.5 mL 5 tablets 212 tablets 72-95 lbs (32.7-43.2 kg) 11 yrs 3 teaspoons or 15 mL 6 tablets 3 tabletsChoose the proper medicine, and measure the dose accurately. 1. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist which medicine is best for your child. 2. Give the dose based on your child's weight. If you don't know your child's weight, give the dose based on your child's age. Do not give more medicine than is recommended. 3. If you have questions about dosage amounts or any other concerns, call your healthcare provider. 4. Always use a proper measuring device. For example: When giving acetaminophen liquid (e.g., Tylenol), use the device enclosed in the package. If you misplace the device, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice. Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. When giving ibuprofen liquid (e.g., Advil, Motrin), use the device enclosed in the package. Never use a kitchen spoon! Take these two steps to avoid causing a serious medication overdose in your child. 1. Don't give your child a larger amount of acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) than is shown in the table below. Too much of any of these medicines can cause an overdose. 2. When you give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, don't also give them over-the-counter (OTC) cough or cold medicines. This can also cause a medication overdose because cough and cold medicines often con - tain acetaminophen or ibuprofen. In fact, to be safe, don't give OTC cough and cold medicines to your child unless you talk to your child's healthcare provider first.Medicines and Dosages to Reduce Pain and Fever Acetaminophen (Tylenol or another brand): How much to give? Give every 4 to 6 hours, as needed, no more than 5 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider). Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or another brand): How much to give? Give every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, no more than 4 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider).

In an attempt to reduce the confu - sion over different strengths that have been blamed for past overdoses, some manufacturers are voluntarily offer - ing only the less concentrated version for all children. Until now, liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants has only been available in a stronger concentration that doesn't require giving the infants as much liquid with each dose. But right now both concentrations of liquid acetaminophen are in cir - culation. Before giving the medica - tion, parents and caregivers need to know whether they have the less con - centrated version or the older, more concentrated medication. FDA is con - cerned that infants could be given too much or too little of the medicine if the different concentrations of acet - aminophen are confused. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen\" says Carol Holquist, director of FDA's Division of Medical Error Prevention and Analysis. Here's what the agency wants par - ents and caregivers to do: Read the Drug Facts label on the package very carefully to identify the concentration of the liquid acetaminophen, the correct dosage, and the directions for use. Do not depend on a banner proclaiming that the product is \"new.\" Some medicines with the old concentration also have this headline on their packaging. Use only the dosing device provided with the purchased product in order to correctly measure the right amount of liquid acetaminophen. Consult your pediatrician before giving this medication and make sure you're both talking about the same concentration. Overdosing Has Been a Risk An April 2011 report from FDA's Cen - ter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) found that confusion caused by the different concentrations of liq - uid acetaminophen for infants and children was leading to overdoses that made infants seriously ill, with some dying from liver failure. So to avoid dosing errors, some manufacturers voluntarily changed the liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants from 80 mg per 0.8mL or 80 mg per 1 mL to be the same con - centration as the liquid acetamino - phen marketed for children\u2014160 mg per 5mL. This less concentrated liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants now has new dosing directions and 2 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration DECEMBER 2 011 Consumer Health Information www.fda.gov/consumer Find this and other Consumer Updates at www.fda.gov/ ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates Sign up for free e-mail subscriptions at www.fda.gov/ consumer/consumerenews.htmlmay have a new dosing device in the box, such as an oral syringe. But this is a voluntary change and some of the older, stronger concen - trations of acetaminophen marketed for infants are still available and may remain available. \"There is still some on store shelves; there is still some in homes; and there is still some in distribution,\" says Holquist. Why does this pose a danger? If a pediatrician prescribes a 5 mL dose of the less concentrated liq - uid acetaminophen, but the parents administer a 5 mL dose of the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen, the child can receive a potentially fatal overdose during the course of therapy, Holquist explains. Conversely, if a physician pre - scribes a dose based on the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen and the less concentrated medication is used, the child might not receive enough medication to fight a fever, she says. FDA has issued a Drug Safety Communication ( www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DrugSafety/ucm284741.htm ) with more information for consumers about how to avoid confusion and potential dosing errors with the different con - centrations of liquid acetaminophen. What Should You Do? Adding to the confusion is the fact that that the box and the bottle may look much the same for both old and new versions of the medication, Holquist says. Read the Drug Facts label to tell the difference between the two liquid acetaminophen products: Look for the \"Active ingredient\" section of the Drug Facts label usually printed on the back of an over-the-counter medication package. If the package says \"160 mg per 5 mL\" or \"160 mg (in each 5 mL)\", then this is the less concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This medication should come with an oral syringe to help you measure the dose. If the package says \"80 mg per 0.8 mL\" or \"80 mg per 1 mL,\" then this is the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This product may come with a dropper. If the dosing instructions provided by your healthcare provider differ from what is on the label, check with a healthcare professional before admin - istering the medication. Do not rely on dosing information provided from other sources such as the Internet, old dosing charts, or family members.It is important to understand that there is no dosing amount specified for children younger than 2 years of age. If you have an infant or child younger than 2 years old, always check with your healthcare provider for dosing instructions. Acetaminophen is marketed for infants under brand names such as Little Fevers Infant Fever/Pain Reliever, Pedia Care Fever Reducer Pain Reliever and Triaminic Infants' Syrup Fever Reducer Pain Reliever. There are also store brands on the shelves. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen.\" Despu\u00e9s de las vacunas... la Si hijo tiene temperatura su profesional o envuelva manera n Dele a su el ni\u00f1o su No casillero abajo).

V AERS data are also available to the public, after all identifying information, such as names and addresses, are removed to protect the privacy of the patient. National V accine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a separate federal program that provides compensation to individuals whose injuries may have been caused by certain vaccines. Please be aware that reporting an event to VAERS does not constitute filing a claim with the VICP . Information on the VICP can be obtained by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting their website at http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation /. For More Information Food and Drug Administration For safety and effectiveness information on FDA-licensed vaccines you can call 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-2000 and visit www.fda.gov/cber/vaers/vaers.htm.

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) is a national program that monitors the safety of vaccines after they are licensed. V AERS is managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vaccines prevent serious illnesses and even death in persons who receive them. Before a vaccine is licensed, FDA takes steps to make sure the vaccine is safe. FDA requires that a vaccine goes through extensive safety testing. After a vaccine is licensed, V AERS is one of the mechanisms used to monitor for any problems, or \"adverse events,\" that happen after vaccination. Not all events reported to V AERS are caused by the vaccine. Even though careful studies are done before a vaccine is licensed, rare adverse effects may not be found until a vaccine is given to millions of people with different backgrounds and medical histories. By continued monitoring , V AERS helps to make sure that the benefits of vaccines are far greater than the risks. Anyone who receives a vaccine should be informed about both the benefits and risks of vaccination. Any questions or concerns should be discussed with a healthcare provider. Limitation and Usefulness of V AERS V AERS is unable to determine that a vaccine caused or did not cause an adverse event. Sometimes people who are vaccinated get sick from another cause unrelated to the vaccine. Even though V AERS cannot determine that a vaccine caused an adverse event, it can give FDA and CDC important information that might signal a problem. If it looks as though a vaccine might be causing an adverse event, FDA and CDC will investigate further. Does V AERS Provide Medical Advice? No, VAERS does not provide medical advice. For medical advice, please contact your healthcare provider or state health department.Who Can Report to V AERS? Parents Patients Healthcare Providers Others FDA and CDC encourage anybody who experiences any problems after vaccination to report to VAERS. Healthcare providers are required by law to report certain problems. Why Should I Report to V AERS? Reporting gives valuable information that helps CDC and FDA make sure that vaccines are safe. Reporting strengthens VAERS so it can be used to assess public health response to vaccines. Reporting allows for evaluating public health prevention and control measures. Remember, no vaccine (or any medicine) is completely free of risk and adverse events are possible. If you have an adverse event after a vaccine, please report to V AERS. Each report is important!

Most cases resolve without sequelae. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other sign ificant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: larynx with stridor and dyspnea. Autopsy findings may include acute emphysema which results from lower respiratory tract obstruction, edema of the hypopha rynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trachea and minimal findings of eosinophilia in the liver, spleen and lungs. When deat h occurs within minutes of exposure and without signs ofrespiratory distress, there may not be significant pathologic findings. (2) Encephalopathy. For purposes of the Vaccine Inju ry Table, a vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy only if such recipient manifests, within the applicable period, an injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy, and then a chronic encephalopathy pers ists in such person for more than 6 months beyond the date of vaccination. (i) An acute encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as to require hospitalization (whether or not hospitalization occurred). (A) For children less than 18 months of age who present without an associat ed seizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a \"sig nificantly decreased level of consciousness\" (see \"D\" below) lasting for at least 24 hours. Those children less than 18 months of age who present following a seizure shall be viewed as having an acute encephalopathy if their significantly decreased level of consciousness persists beyond 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state (seizure) or medication. (B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older , an acute encephalopathy is one that persists for at least 24 hours and characterized by at least two of the following: (1) A significant change in mental status that is not me dication related; specifically a confusional state, or a delirium, or a psychosis; (2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness, which is independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and (3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness. (C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of acute encephalopathy in any age group. (D) A \"significantly decreased level of consciousness\" is indicated by the presence of at least one of the following clinical signs for at least 24 hours or greater (see paragraphs (2)(I)(A) and (2)(I)(B) of this section for applicable timeframes): (1) Decreased or absent response to envi ronment (responds, if at all, only to loud voice or painful stimuli); (2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not fix gaze upon family memb ers or other individuals); or (3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognize familiar people or things). (E) The following clinical features alon e, or in combination, do not demo nstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or level of consciousness as described above: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual scream ing, persistent inconsolable crying, and bulging fontanelle. Seizures in themselves are not sufficient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy. In the absence of other evidence of an acut e encephalopathy, seizures shall not be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of the onset of an acute encephalopathy. (ii) Chronic encephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or neur ologic status, first manifested during the applicable time period, persists for a period of at leas t 6 months from the date of vaccination. Individuals who return to a normal neurologic state after the acute encephalopathy shall not be presumed to have suffered residual neurologic damage from that event; any subseque nt chronic encephalopathy shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acute encephalopathy. If a preponde rance of the evidence indicates that a child's chronic encephalopathy is secondary to genetic, prenatal or peri natal factors, that chronic encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. (iii) An encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if in a proceeding on a petition, it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the encephalopathy was caused by an infection, a toxin, a metabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a genetic disorder or trauma (without regard to whether the cause of the infection, toxin, trauma, metabolic disturbance, structural lesion or genetic disorder is known). If at the time a decision is made on a petition filed under section 2111(b) of the Act for a vaccine- related injury or death, it is not possible to determin e the cause by a preponderan ce of the evidence of an encephalopathy, the encephalopathy shall be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. (iv) In determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition set forth in the Table, the Court shall consider the entire medical record. (3) Seizure and convulsion. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, the terms, \"seizure\" and \"convulsion\" include myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal), and simple and complex partial seizures. Absence (petit mal) seizures shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. Jerking movements or staring episodes alone are not necessarily an indication of seizure activity. (4) Sequela. The term \"sequela\" means a condition or event which was actually caused by a condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table. (5) Chronic Arthritis . For purposes of the V accine Injury Table, chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no history in the 3 years prior to vaccination of ar thropathy (joint disease) on the basis of: A) Medical documentation, recorded within 30 days af ter the onset, of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred between 7 and 42 days after a rubella vaccination; (B) Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years afte r the onset of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuous arthritis for more than 6 months following vaccination: (C) Medical documentation of an antibody response to the rubella virus. For purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, the following shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuse connective tissue diseases (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic otizing vasculitis and vasculopathies and Sjogren 's Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents other than rubella (whether by direct invasion or as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders and arthritis associated with ankylosi ng spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, or blood disorders. Arthralgia (joint pain) or stiffness without joint swelling shall not be viewed as chroni c arthritis for purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table. (6) Brachial neuritis is defined as dysfunction limited to the upper extremity nerve plexus (i.e., its trunks, divisions, or cords) without involvement of other peripheral (e.g., nerve roots or a single peripheral nerve) or central (e.g., spinal cord) nervous system structures . A deep, steady, often severe aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm usually heralds onset of the condition. The pain is follo wed in days or weeks by weakness and atrophy in upper extremity muscle groups. Sensory loss may accompany the motor deficits, but is generally a less notable clinical feature. The neuritis, or plexopathy, may be present on the sa me side as or the opposite side of the injection; it is sometimes bilateral, affecting both upp er extremities. Weakness is required before the diagnosis can be made. Motor, sensory, and reflex findings on physical examination and the results of nerve conduction and electromyographic studies must be consistent in confirming that dysfunction is attributable to the brachial plexus. The condition should thereby be distinguishable from conditions that may give rise to dysfunction of nerve roots (i.e., radiculopathies) an d peripheral nerves (i.e., including mu ltiple mononeuropathies), as well as other peripheral and central nervous system structures (e.g., cranial neuropathies and myelopathies). (7) Thrombocytopenic purpura is platelet count less than 50,000/mm3. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia a ssociated with other causes such as hypersplenism, autoimmune disorders (including alloantibodies from previous transfusions) myelodysplasias, lymphoproliferative disorders, congenital thrombocytopenia or hemolytic uremic syndrome. This does not include cases of immune (formerly called idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that are mediated, for example, by viral or fungal infections, toxins or drugs. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, as observed with bacterial and viral infections. Viral infections includ e, for example, those infections secondary to Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and B, rhinovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, and dengue virus. An antecedent viral infection may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing. Bone marrow examination, if performed, must reveal a normal or an increased number of megakaryocytes in an otherwise normal marrow. (8) Vaccine-strain measles viral infection is defined as a disease caused by the vaccine-strain that should be determined by vaccine-specific monoclonal antib ody or polymerase chain reaction tests. (9)Vaccine-strain polio viral infection is defined as a disease caused by poliovi rus that is isolated from the affected tissue and should be determined to be the vaccine-strain by oligonucleotide or polymeras e chain reaction. Isolation of poliovirus from the stool is not suffi cient to establish a tissue specific in fection or disease caused by vaccine- strain poliovirus.

Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 11/2012 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 1 Copies of the pertinent immunization sections of the Georgia law and Rules of the Department of Public Health are included in this section along with copies of the Immunization Certificate and accompanying Policy Guides. Copies are also posted on the Immunization Program web site under the school resources section. The following is a summary of policies that relate to the law and rules. For more detailed information, please refer to the copies of the law and rules. I. Georgia Law and DPH Rules A. Georgia Law (Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 20-2-771, Section 49-4-182 and Section 49-4-183) defines the target population for which immunity to specified diseases is required and sets standards for the use of immunization certificates. B. The law also charges the Department of Public Health (DPH) with responsibility for specifying which immunizations are required and the standards for the same. These are defined in the immunization section (Chapter 290-5-4) of the Rules of the Department of Public Health. C. The DPH Rules define terms such as \"Immunization,\" \"Physician,\" and \"Health Authority,\" list the diseases for which immunity is required, and state the standards for issuing certificates of immunization based on the current ACIP Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule. D. Georgia Law (Official code of Georgia, Annotated, Article 2 of Chapter 34 of Title 43 in Code Section 43-34-23) was amended relating to medical practice, to authorize advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to sign off on certain documents relating to health care, to include the Georgia Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231). E. Standards for the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) Certificates of Immunization are also defined on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) and the accompanying Policy Guide 3231REQ and Policy Guide 3231INS. F. Georgia law requires immunization of a preschool age child as a condition of receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. The implementation of the law is the responsibility of the Department of Family and Children Services. Proof of compliance will be provided on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231). G. Any school/facility official who does not enforce the requirements or any parent/guardian who does not comply with the requirements is subject to penalties as outlined in Subsection (h) of the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 20-2-771. H. When persons in charge of child care facilities fail to improve unacceptable levels of compliance with the law, despite repeated requests by public health officials, Bright from the Start, Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) should be notified. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health SUMMARY OF IMMUNIZATION POLICIES RELATIVE TO GEORGIA LAW 5. Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 11/2012 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 2 I. Any infant/child who is under the age of four and is attending child care must be age appropriately immunized with the required vaccines during the time of attendance . This means that the certificate for every child under four years of age must be marked with an expiration date that indicates the date the next immunization is due. Once a child is four years of age or older and has met the entry requirements for school, [kindergarten (5 year)], a copy of the Immunization Certificate which has been marked as \"Complete for School\" and includes the vaccine administrat ion dates, or dates of immunity through disease history or serology, may be utilized as documentation for both school and child care facilities. J. Children attending school (5 year old kindergarten-12th grade) must be age appropriately immunized with all the required vaccines at the time of first entry into a school in Georgia. \"New entrant\" is defined as any child entering a Georgia school or facility for the first time, or entering after having been absent for 12 months or 1 school year. This means that if a child is not \"up-to-date\" at the time of entry, he/she may attend school provided the certificate is marked with a current expiration date indicating that the child is in the process of receiving the required vaccines and doses. Once the entry requirements have been met, the certificate must be replaced with a certificate marked \"Complete for School Entry.\" K. Children who are entering a school or child care facility, may be granted a 30 day waiver period by the facility to accommodate the obtaining of immunization records. If necessary, this waiver may be extended from the date of fi rst admittance or first attendance for up to 90 calendar days for children transferring into the school system from out-of-state or entering kindergarten or the school system from out-of- state, providing the parent/guardian can show documentation from their provider or public health clinic that the child is in the process of receiving the required immunizations. A school or child care facility should maintain a file of those children who have been granted a 30 day waiver and should keep the file current. Children who have not submitted an Immunization Certificate by the end of the 30 day grace period should be excluded from further attendance until the appropriate Immunization Certificate is submitted. II. Immunization Certificates A. Physicians, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants licensed in Georgia and qualified employees of a local health department or the State Immunization Program are responsible for certifying that a child has met all the immunization requirements for attendance to school/day care as stipulated by the DPH rules. This certification is documented by the physician's, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, Physician Assistant or health official's signature. B. Schools and child care facilities are responsible for filing and maintaining current certificates. C. A Certificate of Immunization must be on file for each child attending any child care facility or school in Georgia, whether public or private. The certificates must be on site and available for inspection by health officials. D. If a child attends more than one school/facility, a photocopy of the form must be submitted to the second school/facility. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health SUMMARY OF IMMUNIZATION POLICIES RELATIVE TO GEORGIA LAW 5. Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 11/2012 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 3 E. When a provider utilizes computerized versions of the Immunization Certificate (Form 3231), it is the responsibility of that provider to have these versions approved by the Georgia Immunization Program. The certificates must include all of the information that is illustrated on the hard copy of these forms. In addition, when the Georgia Immunization Program makes updates to these certificates, it is the responsibility of the provider to update their computerized versions to reflect these changes and have them approved by the state office. F. Certificates should be marked with either a \"Date of Expiration\" or as \"Complete for School Attendance,\" not both. G. A certificate marked as \"Complete for School Attendance\" does not expire. H. A certificate marked with a \"Date of Expiration\" expires on the date indicated. A current certificate must be submitted within 30 days after the expiration date or the child must be excluded from attendance until a current certificate is submitted. III. Immunization Reports By law, an annual report is required for each facility. This report indicates the percentage of adequately immunized children attending that facility. A. For child care facilities, district or local health personnel must conduct inventories (audits) at least once per year. Licensed child care facilities should maintain at least a 90% compliance level. Health Districts are responsible for working with facilities to obtain and maintain this compliance level. The State Immunization Program will provide district health personnel with a listing of all child care facilities known to Bright from the Start, Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL). Completed Child Care Facilities Status Review forms should be submitted to the State Immunization Program according to the time frame assigned to each district. State Immunization Program Consultants will annually validate the results of the audits. B. For schools, inventories (audits) of immunization records of all kindergarten and sixth grade students must be conducted at least once per year by health departments. Schools should maintain at least a 90% compliance level. Health Districts are responsible for working with schools to obtain and maintain this compliance level. Health Districts may establish their own methodologies for collection of information, utilizing school or other designated personnel, but they are ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the reports. If a health district collaborates with schools or other agencies to conduct the inventory, they are responsible for the training of the individuals who perform and complete the forms. The information must be summarized on the Immunization Inventory for Georgia Schools form and must be submitted to the State Immunization Program. Inventories must be completed so that reports will be received at the State Program office by November 30 of each year. State Immunization Program Consultants will annually validate the results of the audits.

Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 11/2012 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 4 IV. Exemptions Exemptions: Georgia Law (Section 20-2-771) prov ides for two (2) types of exemptions from immunization requirements. A. Medical: A medical exemption for a vaccine should be completed on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) only when there is a physical disability or condition that contraindicates immunization for that particular vaccine. There must be an annual review of the medical exemption and certificates must be reissued with or without indication of the medical exemption. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 20-2-771 (d). B. Religious: For a child to be exempt from immunizations on religious grounds, the parent or guardian must furnish the school/facility with a notarized statement stating that immunization conflicts with his or her religious beliefs. There is not a standard form for religious exemption. The notarized statement must be kept on file in lieu of an immunization certificate. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 20-2-771 (e). The notarized statement must meet the following criteria: (1) State that their religious beliefs conflict with immunization requirements. (2) The statement must be signed and dated by the parent/guardian. (3) The statement must be notarized, dated, and signed by a Notary Public. (4) The statement should be submitted to the school or childcare facility in lieu of an immunization certificate. (5) The statement does not expire.

Immunization of students (a) As used in this Code section, the term: (1) \"Certificate of immunization\" means certif ication by a physician licensed under the laws of this state or by an appropriate official of a local board of heal th, on a form provided by the Department of Public Health, that a named pers on has been immunized in accordance with the applicable rules and regu lations of the Departme nt of Public Health. (2) \"Facility\" means any public or private day-care center or nursery intended for the care, supervision, or instruction of children. (3) \"Responsible official\" means a county school superintendent, a school principal, or a chief operating officer of a school or facility. (4) \"School\" means any public or private educational program or institution instructing children at any level or levels, kindergarten through twelfth grad e, or children of ages five through 19 if grade divisions are not used. (b) No child shall be admitted to or attend any school or facility in this state unless the child shall first have submitted a certificate of immuni zation to the responsibl e official of the school or facility. The responsible official of any school or facility may grant a 30 calendar day waiver of the certification requirement for a justified reason. The waiver may be extended from the date of first admittance or of fi rst attendance, whichever is earlie r, for up to 90 calendar days provided documentation is on file at the school or facility from the local health department or a physician specifying that an immunization sequence has been started and that this immunization time schedule can be completed within the 90 day waiv er period, provided confirmation is received during the waiver period from the health department or physician that immunizations are being received as scheduled, and provided the student under waiver is a transfer student, who is defined as a student who moves from an out-of-state scho ol system to a Georgia school system, or a student entering ki ndergarten or first grade from out of state. The waiver may not be extended beyond 90 calend ar days; and upon expi ration of the waiver, the child shall not be admitted to or be permitte d to attend the school or facility unless the child submits a certificate of immunization.

Immunization of students 5/9/2012 http://web.lexisnexis.co m/research/retrieve? _m=416ee4dc6cf0eef0591a79cc06b756c0&csv (c) The Department of Public Health shall prom ulgate rules and regula tions specifying those diseases against which immunization is required and the standards for such immunizations. The school or facility shall maintain on file the certificates of immuni zation for all children attending the school or facility. All facilities shall file a report annually with the Department of Public Health. The report shall be filed on forms prepared by the Departme nt of Public Health and shall state the number of children attending the school or facility, the number of children who did not submit certificates of immunization within the waiver period, and the number of children who are exempted from the certification requirement for medical or religious reasons.

In October 2010, ACIP recommended expanded use of Tdap. This report provides the updated recommendations, summarizes the safety and effectiveness data considered by ACIP, and provides guidance for implementing the recommendations. ACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11 through18 years who have completed the recommended childhood diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTP/DTaP) vaccination series and for adults aged 19 through 64 years (4,5). 10/2011 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co.

ACIP also recommended vaccination with HPV4 for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series; males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. These recommendations replace the October 2009 ACIP guidance that HPV4 may be given to males aged 9 through 26 years (1). 10/2011 ACIP recommended that all previously unvaccinated adults aged 19 through 59 years with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) be vaccinated against hepatitis B as soon as possible after a diagnosis of diabetes is made (recommendation category A).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is recommending that health care professionals use a sterile needle and syringe to administer inactivated influenza vaccines. The FDA is clarifying its October 21, 2011, communication to inform the public that inactivated infl uenza vaccines labeled for IM injection are intended for administration using a sterile needle and syringe. There is one inactivated influenza vaccine labeled for ID administration, this vaccine is supplied in its own pre-filled syringe. The live attenuated influenza vaccine is given through the nose as a spray; the sprayer is not a jet injector. FDA's recommendation to administer inactivated influenza vaccines using a sterile needle and syringe is based on studies submitted to FDA in support of the vaccine approvals. 02/2012 On February 22, 2012, the ACIP voted to recommend tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) for adults aged 65 years and older. Providers should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate persons aged 65 years and older with Tdap, and may administer the vaccine that they have available. When feasible, for adults aged 65 years and older, Boostrix should be used; however, either vaccine product administered to a person aged 65 years and older provides protection and is considered valid. 04/2012 Temporary shortage of Pentacel\u00ae and DAPTACEL\u00ae due to manufacturer delays. 04/2012 Directive for 3231 GRITS Certificate.

The \"Date of Issue\" is the date a child's immunization status was reviewed and the certificate was issued. It must be filled in. 12. During times when vaccine shortages may necessitate deferral of doses of specific vaccines, the GA Immunization Program will follow the recommendations made by the ACIP and will send providers the interim plans for issuing certificates based on these temporary recommendations. Exemptions: The Official Code of Georgia provides for only two types of exemptions from immunization requirements: 1. Medical: Medical exemption for a vaccine should be filled in only when there is a physical disability or condition that contraindicates immunization for that partic ular vaccine. There must be an annual review of medical exemptions, and certificates must be reissu ed with or without indication of exemption. O.C.G.A. \u00a720-2-771(d) 2. Religious: For a child to be exempt from immunizations on religious grounds, the parent or guardian must furnish the school/facility with a notarized affidavit stati ng that immunization conflicts with his or her religious beliefs. There is no standard form for Religious Exemption. The school/facility must keep the affidavit on file and available for inspection by health officials in lieu of an Immunization Certificate. Affidavits denoting religious exemption do not expire. O.C.G.A. \u00a720-2-771(e) Certificate ordering and computer generated facsimiles: 1.

Surveillance and Reporting---09/2012 Surveillance Each District (or local) Health office must maintain a surveillance system to monitor the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) in their community, especially as immunization rates increase. In most areas of the state, a passive disease surveillance system is used to collect information on vaccine preventable disease. This type of surveillance system is simpler and less burdensome than active surveillance, but is limited by incompleteness of data and a lack of timeliness. Even after efforts are made to publicize the importance of reporting, passive surveillance systems may still not be representative of the disease burden in the community and may fail to identify outbreaks. The quality of surveillance data can be improved through active surveillance, in which public health officials contact providers and/or laboratories regularly to identify cases of reportable disease. This type of surveillance system yields more complete data, and validates the representativeness of the data for vaccine preventable diseases and other notifiable conditions. Active systems require more resources and therefore are generally used for brief periods or discrete purposes (e.g., CDC projects such as the Emerging Infections Program, disease elimination projects, etc.) Procedure for Reporting Each and every case of vaccine-preventable disease (confirmed or suspect) must be investigated promptly and thoroughly. All positive and \"suspect\" cases of vaccine- preventable disease should be reported immediately to the Acute Disease Epidemiology Section, Department of Public Health. District Epidemiologists and Communicable Disease Coordinators will have primary responsibility for VPD case investigations in partnership with the VPD Epidemiologists at DPH. The District Immunization Coordinators and Immunization Field staff will initiate case follow up if the epidemiologist is unavailable. Detailed instructions for case investigation and reporting for each vaccine preventable disease are included in the Disease Fact Sheets in this section. Also included in this section are copies of the Notifiable Disease Reporting Poster, the Notifiable Disease Report Form (#3095), disease worksheets, and lab submission forms, all of which are referenced in the Disease Fact Sheets. Enclosed is a line listing for the contact persons for VPD surveillance and case investigation at the District Health offices, Immunization Program and the Acute Disease Epidemiology Section (ADES). For questions regarding a specific vaccine preventable disease, please contact the ADES epidemiologist listed for the specific disease. If that person is unavailable, please speak with any ADES epidemiologist for assistance. The Acute Disease Epidemiology Section's main phone number is (404) 657-2588. Please remember that contact names and numbers may change frequently, therefore call the ADES main number if you are having difficulty reaching a specific individual, or if you have any questions regarding the investigation or reporting of a vaccine preventable disease or any other reportable disease.

Nasopharyngitis due to diphtheria commonly presents with patches of adherent, grayish membrane with a surrounding dull red inflammatory zone on the tonsils, soft palate, uvula, and/or back of the pharynx. In severe disease, obstruction of the respiratory tract develops due to extensive membrane formation and there may be marked tenderness and swelling of the neck (Bull Neck). Late effects of diphtheria may include myocarditis and motor and sensory nerve palsy. Most clinical characteristics are caused by the release of a cytotoxin by the bacteria. Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal infection (carriage) occurs in the general population despite vaccination. In the United States, severe diphtheria infection has been documented to occur more frequently in American Indian and homeless populations. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Transmission is most often person-to-person via respiratory tract droplets from an infected patient or carrier. Rarely, transmission may occur from skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of infected persons. Incubation Period: Usually 2 to 5 days (range, 1 - 10 days). Period of Communicability: Variable, until virulent bacilli have cleared from discharges and lesions; shedding is usually 2 weeks or less, and seldom more than 4 weeks. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding within 4 days. Chronic carriers are rare but may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Clinical Case Definition: An upper-respiratory tract illness characterized by sore throat, low- grade fever, and an adherent membrane of the tonsil(s), pharynx, and/or nose. Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of toxin producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae from a nasopharyngeal specimen (preferably a culture of membrane tissue or a swab of tissue underlying the membrane), or PCR positive for Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin by the CDC Diphtheria Laboratory. Diagnostic Testing: A. Culture (THE LABORATORY MUST BE INFORMED THAT YOU SUSPECT DIPHTHERIA. A SPECIAL MEDIUM IS REQUIRED FOR ISOLATION OF THIS ORGANISM.) 1. Specimen: Throat or nasopharyngeal swab. 2. Outfits: Culture referral outfit, order #505, and Loeffler's slant outfit, order #560. 3. Lab Form: Culture referral form #3410 and Loeffler's slant form #3415. 4. Lab Test Performed: Isolation and identification of organism, toxigenicity testing. 5. Lab: State Bacteriology Laborator y (A REFERENCE LABORATORY IS NEEDED). 6. Transport requirements: If the duration of transport is < 24hrs, use Amies medium; if duration 24 hrs, use silica gel sachets. Isolates will be subcultured Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 2 7. on Loeffler, Pai egg, or cystine blood agar slants. Toxigenicity testing will be performed at CDC. Send suspected isolates in culture referral outfit (#0505). B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 1. Specimen: Throat or nasopharyngeal swab. 2. Outfits: Culture referral outfit, order #505, and Loeffler's slant outfit, order #560. 3. Lab Form: Culture referral form #3410 and Loeffler's slant form #3415. 4. Lab Test Performed: PCR. 5. Lab: CDC Diphtheria Lab - alert lab when Diphtheria is suspected, so that a specific PCR assay can be used. 6. Transport requirements: silica gel sachet, or a sterile dry container at 4 degrees Celsius. Comment: C. diphtheria from non-respiratory sources (e.g. cutaneous, vaginal, otic) should not be reported. All toxin-producing C. diphtheria respiratory isolates, regardless of association with disease, should be sent to the Diphtheria Laboratory, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC. Case Classification: Probable: A clinically compatible case that is not laboratory confirmed and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. Confirmed : A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed and epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. Carrier: An asymptomatic person with laboratory confirmed C. diphtheria isolated from the nasopharynx. Vaccination: Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all pers ons at least 6 weeks old but < 7 years of age and without a history of contraindications. DTaP is the preferred vaccine for all doses in the vaccination series (including completion of the series in children who have received one or more doses of whole-cell DTP). The primary vaccination with DTaP series consists of a three- dose series, administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the first three doses. The fourth dose (first booster) is recommended at 15-18 months of age to maintain adequate immunity during preschool years. The fifth dose (second booster) is recommended for children aged 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years of schooling. Routine tetanus booster immunization with Tdap, the adult formulation of tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and acellular pertussis is recommended for all persons > 10 years of age. Treatment: Diphtheria antitoxin (of equine origin) should be given when diphtheria is suspected, without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Detailed recommendations can be obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health and CDC. Antitoxin is only available for treatment of clinical cases through CDC. The re sponsible health-care provider should contact the State Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588, or if after hours the State Epidemiologist on call at 1-800 PUB-HLTH, to request antitoxin, obtain authorization for its release and make arrangements for transport. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 3 Antimicrobial therapy is also required to eradicate the organism and prevent spread, but it is not a substitute for antitoxin in clinical cases of diphtheria . Either erythromycin or penicillin is recommended to be administered for a 14-day treatment course. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis: A single dose of benzathine penicillin or a 7-10 day course of erythromycin is recommended for all persons with household exposure to diphtheria, regardless of their immunization status. Investigation: Guidelines for investigating a suspected case and for managing contacts are published and are referenced below. Management of close contacts of suspected cases should include screening for possible respiratory or cutaneous diphtheria, obtaining nasopharyngeal cultures for C. diphtheriae , administering prophylactic antibiotics, treatment and follow-up of carriers, assessing diphtheria vaccination status, and administering any necessary vaccinations. The CDC Diphtheria Worksheet may be used for guidelines in conducting a case investigation. Reporting: Report all suspect, probable, and confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the State Epidemiology Section at 404-657- 2588. If calling after regular business hours, it is very important to report cases to the Epidemiology Section answering service by calli ng 1-866-PUB-HLTH. After a verbal report has been made, please transmit the case information electronically through the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SENDSS) at http://sendss.state.ga.us , or complete and mail a CDC Diptheria Worksheet.

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) Brief Description: An acute infectious disease with fever, fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin and eyeballs. The disease varies widely in severity ranging from asymptomatic to a mild illness without jaundice lasting one to two weeks in children, to severe debilitating illness and lasting several weeks with prolonged convalescence in adults. Fortunately, recovery is generally complete and without complication. Reservoir: Humans; rarely chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates. Mode of Transmission: The primary mode of transmission is by the fecal-oral route. This includes ingestion of fecally contaminated water or ice; raw or undercooked shellfish; fruits, vegetables, and other foods eaten uncooked that may have become contaminated during handling. Contact with stool from infected infants and toddlers during diaper changes that is not immediately followed by thorough hand washing is a common means of spread to day care and household contacts. Waterborne transmission of hepatitis A is more common in places with inadequate sewage disposal and water treatment, such as can be found in developing nations. Sexual contact can spread the virus. In rare cases bloodborne transmission occurs. Incubation Period: Average 28-30 days; Range 15-50 days. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness with Discrete onset of symptoms, and Jaundice, dark urine or elevated serum aminotransferase levels (ALT >200 IU/L) Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) positive. Note that a person may remain IgM positive for six months or longer after infection, which makes it difficult to determine the timing of infection in a person who has been asymptomatic. Diagnostic Testing: Serology 1. Specimen: 3432 4. Lab Tests Performed: Anti-HAV (total) and Anti-HAV IgM 5. Lab: State Immunology Laboratory (GPHL) 6. Transport requirements: All specimens should be transported as soon as possible. Refrigerate if specimen must be held overnight. Specimens >14 days old or hemolyzed will be rejected. Case Classification : Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and is laboratory confirmed -or- a case that meets the clinical case definition and occurs in a person who has an epidemiologic link with a person who has laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A (i.e., household or sexual contact with an infected person during the 15-50 days before the onset of symptoms). Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 2 Period of Communicability: Hepatitis A virus is highly infective, requiring only a few virus particles to cause infection. The virus is present in the highest quantity in stool during the latter half of the incubation period (7-14 days prior to onset of illness). Most cases are not infectious after the first week of jaundice. Vaccine: Three inactivated vaccines are currently available to protect against infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV). Protection begins two to four weeks after the first dose of hepatitis A vaccine. A second dose is considered necessary for long-term protection. Two vaccines, HAVRIX and VAQTA, are currently licensed for persons 12 months of age and older and are available in two formulations based on the recipient's age. The third vaccine, TWINRIX, is a hepatitis A and hepatitis B combination vaccine licensed for persons 18 years of age or older. Pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at 12 months of age, persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate rates of hepatitis A, persons with chronic liver disease or clotting factor disorders, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, persons who work with HAV infected primates or with HAV in laboratory settings, and any person who wishes to be immune to hepatitis A. Post-exposure vaccine use is listed below. For more detailed vaccination information, see Hepatitis A Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: No specific therapy for HAV infection is available, other than supportive care. Hepatitis A is usually self-limiting. Post-exposure Prophylaxis of Contacts: Depending on age of contact, immune globulin (IG) or hepatitis A vaccine should be offered after exposure to hepatitis A if it can be given within 14 days of last exposure to the case as indicated below: Persons who live in the same household, or who are intimate and/or sex partners of a diagnosed case Day care center associated cases as follows: Children who attend the same room as a diagnosed case Workers who change diapers in a day care center with a diagnosed case Inmates in the same cell in a detention center Foodhandlers who work with the acute case When a food worker has acute infection, consideration may be given to prophylaxis of patrons if prophylaxis can be given within 14 days of la st exposure and the case worked while having diarrhea and/or having questionable hygienic practices, combined with having contact with ready-to-eat foods. Consult the Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588 promptly in these instances. For contacts younger than 12 months of age, older than 40 years of age, those who are immunocompromised, and persons with chronic liver disease, give IG as a single dose of 0.02 ml per kilogram of body weight within 14 days after exposure to hepatitis A. Immune globulin is NOT recommended for hepatitis A exposure for business, office or school contacts, or household visitors (e.g., neighbors and relatives) who do not meet the above criteria. When IG is not readily available, hepatitis A vaccine c an be given to contacts older than 40 years of age. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 3 Investigation: Complete the hepatitis case report in SENDSS (State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System) at https://sendss.state.ga.us to aid in the investigation. Conduct an assessment of the patient for high-risk activities (food handler, day care attendee/provider, health care provider) and hygienic practices such as hand washing. Determine whether the case worked while experiencing diarrhea. Assess the need for immune globulin (IG) or vaccine as indicated above for contacts of the case patient, and educate case contacts regarding the risk of hepatitis A virus transmission. Investigate the source of the infection. Attention should be paid to sanitation and potential fecal contamination via food or water. Advise hepatitis A vaccine for international travelers, men who have sex with men, persons with chronic liver disease, and others who will be at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A in the future. Special evaluation is indicated for outbreaks in institutional settings and hepatitis in food handlers. Consult the Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588 promptly in these instances. Reporting: Report acute, laboratory-confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588. If calling after regular business hours, reports can be made to 1-866-PUB-HLTH (782-4584).

Links: CDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet - http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis HEPATITIS A Q&A What is hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by a specific virus. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of several viruses known to cause hepatitis (liver inflammation) in humans. Prior to 2006, several hundred cases were reported in Georgia each year. Who gets hepatitis A? Anyone who has not previously been infected with or vaccinated against hepatitis A can become infected. Certain persons at increas ed risk of exposure to hepatitis A include: Children and employees of child care centers where a child or employee has hepatitis A Persons who share a household or have sexual contact with someone with hepatitis A Travelers to developing countries where hepatitis A is common and where clean water and proper sewage disposal are not readily available; and Residents and staff of institutions for disabled children where a resident or an employee has hepatitis A. How is the hepatitis A virus spread? The hepatitis A virus enters through the mouth, multiplies in the body and is passed in the feces. The virus is fairly hardy and can be carried on an infected person's hands and can be spread by direct contact, or by consuming food or drink that has been handled by the individual. In some cases, consuming untreated or inadequately treat ed water contaminated with improperly treated sewage can spread it. Eating raw or undercooked shellfish (e.g., mussels, oysters, and clams) is another way one can become infected. What are the symptoms of hepatitis A? In outbreak settings, three of every four persons infected with hepatitis A virus have symptoms. When the symptoms are present, they usually develop suddenly and may include fatigue, poor appetite, fever and vomiting. Urine may become darker in color, and then jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) may appear. The disease is rarely fatal and most people recover in a few weeks without any complications. Infants and young children tend to be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and ar e less likely to develop jaundice than are older children and adults. Not everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms, but adults are more likely to have symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms usually begin to appear three to four weeks after exposure, but the onset of symptoms may range two to seven weeks after exposure. When and for how long is an infected person able to spread the virus? The contagious period begins about a week before the symptoms appear and may extend up to a week after jaundice (a yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes) begins. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 5 Does past infection with hepatitis A make a person immune? Yes. Once an individual recovers from hepatitis A, he or she is immune for life and does not continue to carry the virus. Additionally, vaccination against hepatitis A is thought to provide lifelong protection against infection. What is the treatment for hepatitis A? There are no special medicines to treat a person once the symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest is all that is needed. Occasionally an ill person with severe vomiting and/or diarrhea is hospitalized for rehydration. How can hepatitis A be prevented? An important way to prevent spread of hepatitis A is careful handwashing after using the toilet. Infected people should not handle foods served to others during the contagious period. Household members or others who have not been immunized, but are in close contact with an infected person, should promptly call a doctor or the health department to determine whether a shot of immune globulin or hepatitis A vaccine can decrease their chances of becoming ill. The FDA has approved two vaccines that very effectively protect against infection with hepatitis A virus. Persons in higher risk groups (e.g. travelers to developing countries) may wish to consider being vaccinated. All children should be vaccinated at 12 months of age. Please contact the Georgia Immunization Program at (404) 657-3158 for current vaccine recommendations. Where can I get additional information on hepatitis A?

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Brief Description: Exposure to HBV may result in transient or chronic infections, either of which can be asymptomatic. Hepatitis B can present as an acute infectious disease with fever, malaise, loss of appetite, vague abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, sometimes arthralgias and rash, often progressing to jaundice. Liver enzyme levels are markedly elevated. Fever may be absent or mild. Severity ranges from inapparent cases detectable only by liver function tests, to fatal cases of acute hepatic necrosis. The likelihood of becoming a chronic carrier is a ffected by age at infection. Fewer than 5% of acutely infected adults in the U.S. become chronic carriers, compared with some 25% (with HBeAg-negative mothers) to 90% (HBeAg-positive mothers) of perinatally infected infants. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for developing cirrhosis and/or primary hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to end-stage liver disease later in life. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: HBV is usually transmitted by contact with the blood, semen, or vaginal secretions of an infected person. HBV may also be found in saliva and other body fluids. The virus must be introduced through broken skin or come into contact with mucous membranes for infection to occur. In addition, percutaneous transmission of HBV can occur through blood or blood product transfusion, needle sharing, hemodialysis, acupuncture, tattooing, and needlesticks. Indirect inoculation of HBV can also occur via inanimate objects, as the virus can remain viable outside the body for at least 7 days. Incubation Period: Varies from 45-180 days - usually between 60 and 90 days. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness with: Discrete onset of symptoms, and Jaundice or elevated serum aminotransferase levels (ALT >200 IU/L). Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: 1. IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) positive and/or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and 2. IgM anti-HAV negative (if done) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6.

May be recovering from acute HBV infection (in the \"core window phase\" before anti-HBs appears); 2. May be distantly immune, and the test is not sensitive enough to detect very low levels of anti-HBs in serum; 3. May have a false positive anti-HBc; or 4. May be chronically infected with HBV and have an undetectable level of HBsAg in the serum. HBeAg is tested in the presence of HBsAg and, if present, is a marker of intense virus production. Diagnostic Testing: 1. Specimen: Serum/blood, >6 ml. 2. Outfits: Outfit Performed: HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc (IgG). Georgia Public Health Lab (GPHL) in Decatur does not currently offer anti-HBc IgM, but this is available through commercial laboratories. 5. Lab: GPHL Immunology Laboratory, hospital laboratories, and private clinic laboratories. 6. Transport requirements: All specimens should be transported as soon as possible. Refrigerate if specimen must be held overnight. Specimens >14 days old or hemolyzed will be rejected. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 3 Case Classification Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is laboratory confirmed, and is not known to have chronic hepatitis B. Persons who have chronic hepatitis or persons identified as HBsAg positive should not be reported as having acute viral hepatitis unless they have evidence of an acute illness compatible with viral hepatitis or documented seroconversion. Comment: Also reportable (in addition to acute hepatitis B): (1) all newly identified HBsAg- positive carriers, (2) all HBsAg-positive pregnant women. Period of Communicability: All persons who are HBsAg positive are potentially infectious. Blood can be infective many weeks before the fi rst onset of symptoms and remain infective through the acute clinical course of the disease. For chronically infected people, the infectivity varies from highly infectious (HBeAg positive) to potentially infectious (anti-HBe positive). Vaccination: Vaccination is recommended for all infants as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Three doses comprise the series: Dose one: at birth Dose two: between 1 month and 4 months (but at least 1 month after 1st dose) Dose three: between 6 months and 18 months (but at least 4 months after 1st dose, and 2 months after 2nd dose, but no earlier than 24 weeks of age). For more detailed vaccination information, see Hepatitis B Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. All children should be vaccinated by 11-12 years of age. Risk of hepatitis B infection increases in the adolescent years, so catch-up vaccination is recommended for children, adolescents and young adults, especially in certain sub-populations, such as Alaska Natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and immigrants from countries with high HBV endemicity. In addition, the following categories of high-risk adults should be immunized: 1. Heterosexuals with >1 sex partner in t he last 6 months, or who have a sexually transmitted disease 2. Men who have sex with men (MSM) 3. Household contacts and sex partners of HBsAg-positive people 4. Injection drug users (IDU) 5. Healthcare personnel, and others with occupational risk of infection through exposure to blood (including but not limited to public safety workers, trainees in medicine, dentistry, nursing, and laboratory technology) 6. Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons. 7. Staff of non-residential child care and school programs attending to HBsAg-positive developmentally disabled children. 8. Hemodialysis patients 9. Patients with bleeding disorders. 10. Household members of adoptees who are HBsAg positive 11. International travelers to areas with high or intermediate rates of HBV infection 12. Inmates of juvenile detention centers or long-term correctional facilities 13. Persons with HIV infection Note: See Chapter 2 of this Manual for list of persons eligible for state-supplied vaccine in Public Health clinics. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 4 Although recommended in infancy, the vaccine series can be given at any time. A lapse in immunization does not require restarting the series. Studies have demonstrated vaccine efficacy with one-year intervals between dos es. Vaccine is most effective if given intramuscularly. Thus the deltoid (arm) is recommended in persons >18 months old, and antero-lateral thigh for infants and children 18 months or younger. Treatment: No specific therapy for acute HBV infection is available, other than supportive care. Several drugs are now licensed for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the USA. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Passive immunization with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine are both used to prevent infection. To be effective, HBIG must be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 7 days after blood exposure and 14 days after sexual exposure). HBIG is available commercially and may be provided by the Georgia Immunization Program under certain specific conditions. (See Chapter 2 for table entitled, \"Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the GA Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults.\") Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in the following situations: 1. Perinatal exposure to HBsAg-positive mother 2. Percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood 3. Sexual exposure to a HBsAg-positive individual 4. Known exposure to an acute hepatitis B case Investigation: Collect information about possible exposures, including high-risk behavior during the period 45-180 days before the onset of illness. Particular emphasis should be placed on 60-90 days before symptom onset. Investigators should identify contacts that could benefit from hepatitis B vaccination or HBIG. Special attention should be paid to the presence of hepatitis B among women of childbearing age, since post-exposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG soon after birth is 90-95% effective in preventing infection in the infant with attendant likelihood of chronic disease (see Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines section for complete details). Follow-up: All new cases of hepatitis B should be re-tested for HBsAg after six months to determine whether infection has cleared or a chronic infection is present. Those persons still HBsAg-positive are considered confirmed chronic carriers, and should be counseled accordingly and referred for maintenance care. Refer to the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines for detailed follow-up recommendations of HBsAg-positive women, their infants, and sexual and household contacts. Reporting: Report all cases of acute hepatitis B, newly identified HBsAg-positive carriers, and HBsAg-positive pregnant women WITHIN SEVEN DAYS electronically through the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SENDSS) at https://sendss.state.ga.us .

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 6 HEPATITIS B Q&A What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by a specific virus. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of several viruses known to cause hepatitis (liver inflammation) in humans. HBV is completely unrelated to the viruses that cause hepatitis A, C, or other non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis. The HBV may cause mild illness or result in no symptoms, but can also cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Who gets hepatitis B? All people, regardless of age or residence, may be at risk for hepatitis B. Those at greatest risk include: Certain health care workers who have contact with infected blood Injecting drug users (IDU) who share needles and drug equipment Men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly those with multiple partners Other persons with multiple sex partners Sex partners of people infected with HBV Patients or workers in a residence for the developmentally disabled Hemodialysis patients Certain household contacts of an infected person Infants born to mothers who are carriers of HBV Children of individuals born in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Amazon Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, and the Middle East Persons who have spent time in correctional facilities. If you are at risk for HBV infection, ask your health care provider about hepatitis B vaccine. How is hepatitis B virus spread? Hepatitis B virus can be found in the blood, semen and, to a lesser extent, saliva and other body fluids of an infected person. It is spread by dire ct contact with infected body fluids, usually by needlestick injury or sexual contact. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to baby at birth. HBV is not spread by casual contact. What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? The symptoms of hepatitis B include fatigue, poor appetite, fever, vomiting, and occasionally joint pain, hives or rash. Urine may become darker in color, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) may appear. Some individuals may experience few or no symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms may appear two to six months after exposure, but usually within three months. When and for how long is a person able to spread the virus? The virus can be found in blood and other body fluids several weeks before symptoms appear, and it generally persists for several months afterwards. Some people with HBV infection may become long-term carriers of the virus, and may be able to spread the virus over many years. What is the hepatitis B carrier state? Some persons infected with HBV never fully recover and carry the virus for the rest of their lives. These persons have chronic infection and are known as carriers. They can infect other household and sexual contacts throughout their lives. Among adolescents and adults who get hepatitis B, 5%-10% develop a lifelong infection. When young children are infected, the risk of Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 7 lifelong infection is much higher (up to 90%). An estimated one million people have lifelong hepatitis B virus infections in the United States today. Why is hepatitis B a problem for pregnant women and their babies? Pregnant women may have HBV in their blood without knowing it and can pass it on to their babies at birth, if their infants are not vaccinated at birth. Many of these babies develop lifelong HBV infections and can pass the virus on to others throughout their lives. At first, babies may not look or feel sick, but as they grow up, they may have liver damage. About 25% of babies who develop lifelong HBV infections die prematurely of liver disease or liver cancer. What is the treatment for hepatitis B? There are no special medicines that can be used to treat a person once the symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest as needed is recommended for acute hepatitis B infection. What precautions should hepatitis B carriers take? Hepatitis B carriers should follow standard hygienic practices to ensure that their blood and other body fluids do not directly contaminate close contacts. Carriers must not share razors, toothbrushes, insulin needles, or any other object that may become contaminated with blood. Susceptible household members, particularly sex partners, should be immunized with hepatitis B vaccine. It is important for carriers to inform their dentists and health care providers. Medications are available to treat persons with chronic hepatitis B, but they don't work for everyone. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Preventing hepatitis B is important because of the risk of lifelong infection leading to serious liver problems. A vaccine has been used since 1982 to prevent hepatitis B. The vaccine is given in a series of three shots. Hepatitis B vaccine is safe, effective and is recommended for All babies, beginning at birth Everyone 18 years of age and younger Adults over 18 years of age who are at risk for HBV infection Persons whose jobs expose them to human blood.

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium often found in the upper respiratory tract of humans. H. influenzae is divided into several strains based on the presence of a polysaccharide capsule virulence factor. Encaps ulated strains are considered \"typable\" (types A, B, C, D, E, and F), while non-encapsulated strains are non-typable. Brief Description: H. influenzae causes a variety of illnesses. Typable strains, especially type B (\"Hib\") and type F, have been commonly associated with invasive disease, including meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pericarditis, and bacteremia. Historically, type B was a common, devastating pathogen, especially in children; however, since the widespread use in the U.S. of conjugate vaccines against Hib, cases caused by Hib have decreased drastically. Non-typable H. influenzae is occasionally associated with otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis, conjunctiviti s, aggravation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neonatal and maternal sepsis, and bacteremia. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Spread occurs through airborne droplets or by direct contact with infectious secretions. Between 30% and 80% of people are carriers of non-typable H. influenzae , while approximately 2% are carriers of types A, C, D, E, and F and less than 1% carry type B (in a vaccinated population). Illness may occur in carriers when host immunity is compromised for some reason. Incubation Period: Unknown, possibly 2-4 days. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of H. influenzae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid). Diagnostic Testing: 1. Specimen: Blood, CSF, or other sterile site for culture; pure specimen for serotyping. 2. Outfits: Sterile vial for isolation and identification; culture referral order #0505 for serotyping. 3. Lab Form: Form 3410. 4. Lab Test Performed: Bacterial isolation and identification; H. influenzae serotyping. 5. Lab Performing Test: Isolation and identification is usually performed at hospital or private labs; serotyping is performed at the GPHL Bacteriology Section in Decatur. Case Classification: Probable: a clinically compatible case with detection of H. influenzae antigen in CSF or other sterile site. Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed by culture. Period of Communicability: As long as organisms are present, which may be for a prolonged period even without nasal discharge. Cases are considered non-infectious 24-48 hours after starting effective antibiotic therapy. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 2 Vaccination: A conjugate vaccine for Hib has been licensed for use in the U.S. since the mid- 1980s. Children should get Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age (if PRP-OMP vaccine is used, the dose at 6 months is not required). Children over 5 years of age usually do not need Hib vaccine. Older children or adults with sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow transplant, or undergoing chemotherapy should also receive Hib vaccine. For more detailed vaccination information, see Haemophilus Influenzae Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment : The 2012 Red Book recommends a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for initial treatment. Meropenem or chloramphenicol plus ampicillin are alternative treatment regimens. The patient should be given rifampin before discharge from the hospital to ensure elimination of the organism if a regimen other than ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was used to treat illness. Reporting: Report all confirmed cases of invasive H. influenzae IMMEDIATELY electronically though the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SENDSS) at http://sendss.state.ga.us . All isolates should be immediately forwarded to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) to determine whether or not the case is Hib. Investigation: Identification of young children who are close contacts of cases and assessment of their vaccination status may help identify persons who should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis and who need to be immunized. In particular, household and day care classroom contacts should be immediately identified. Prophylaxis and Follow-Up of Contacts [disease caused by type B (Hib) only]: Observe contacts under 6 years old (especially infants) for indications of illness and provide prompt medical attention should signs and symptoms appear. Rifampin prophylaxis is warranted for all household contacts, including adults, in households with: a. One or more infants <12 months of age who has not received the primary series b. A child 1-3 years of age who is unimmunized or incompletely immunized c. An immunocompromised child. When two or more cases of invasive disease have occurred within 60 days at a day care facility or school which un-immunized or under-immunized children attend, administration of rifampin to all attendees and supervisory personnel is controversial. Efforts should be made to ensure that a ll day care attendees under 5 years of age are fully vaccinated. Dosage of rifampin for prophylaxis: a. Age <1 month: 10 mg/kg once daily for 4 days; b. Age 1 month: 20 mg/kg once daily for 4 days, maximum daily dose 600 mg. c. For adults, each dose is 600 mg. d. Rifampin can be administered to infants and children suspended in simple syrup or as a dry powder mixed with applesauce.

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 4 What is invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease is a serious disease caused by bacteria. Before Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years old in the United States. Today invasive disease is less common, and is more often caused by seroty pes that are not prevented by the Hib vaccine (types A, C, D, E, F, and non-typable). Who gets invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Before the introduction of the Hib vaccine, almost all invasive infections were among children under 5 years of age and were caused by serotype B. Two-thirds of cases were among children less than 18 months of age. Due to high vaccination rates, Hib invasive disease is now less common among children, although invasive disease due to all serotypes continues to occur at low levels in children and adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions. How is Haemophilus influenzae spread? The bacteria spread from person to person via airborne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions. If the bacteria stay in the person's nose and throat, the person probably will not get sick. Sometimes the bacteria spread into the lungs or the bloodstream, and then Haemophilus influenzae can cause serious problems. What are the symptoms of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease can affect different organ systems of the body. The most common types of disease include meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord coverings, which can lead to lasting brain damage and deafness); pneumonia; severe swelling in the throat, which makes it difficult to breathe; infections of the blood, joints, bones, and covering of the heart; and death. How soon after contact could illness develop? This is uncertain. The period is probably short, from 2-4 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread Haemophilus influenzae ? As long as the bacteria are present, which could be for a prolonged period of time. Within 24-48 hours after beginning treatment with appropriate antibiotics, a person should no longer be able to spread the infection. How can a person find out if he or she has invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? A doctor may take a sample of blood or spinal fluid from an ill person to conduct laboratory tests. What is the treatment for invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Hospitalization is generally necessary. A doctor will prescribe antibiotics for treatment. How can invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease be prevented? For type B Haemophilus influenzae , the Hib vaccine can prevent disease. Children should get Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age (if the PRP-OMP vaccine is used, the dose at 6 months is not required). If a dose is missed, the next dose should be given as soon as possible; there is no need to start over. Hib vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children over 5 years old usually do not need Hib vaccine. Older children or adults with sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow transplant, or undergoing chemotherapy should get the Hib vaccine. Vaccines have not yet been developed to prevent disease caused by other serotypes of H. influenzae. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 5 Other ways to prevent invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease include regular handwashing, good hygiene, and disposal of soiled tissues after use.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Measles virus. Brief Description: An acute, highly communicable, systemic, viral infection characterized by a prodromal period of 2 to 4 days, in which fever and malaise, cough, coryza (profuse amount of clear nasal discharge), and conjunctivitis are ob served. Approximately 3 to 4 days later, a characteristic maculopapular (dusky-red blotchy) rash appears on the face and neck. The rash usually starts at the hairline, then spreads downward and outward to the trunk, hands and feet. The rash generally lasts 5 to 6 days. Koplik's spots, characteristic blue-white spots against the bright red background of the buccal (cheek) mucosa, may be observed 1 to 2 days before or 1 to 2 days after the appearance of the maculopapular rash. Complications include diarrhea, otitis media, pneumonia and encephalitis. One or more co mplications occur in approximately 30% of reported measles cases. In recent years, mortality from measles occurred in roughly 1 to 2 per 1000 reported cases in the United States. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Airborne by small droplet spread, direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of an infected person, and less commonly by articles freshly soiled with secretions of nose and throat. Incubation Period: Commonly10 to 12 days from exposure to prodrome (range, 7 to 21 days). The rash usually appears approximat ely 14 days after exposure. Period of Communicability: Measles is highly communicable, with greater than 90% secondary attack rates among susceptible persons. Persons with measles are considered infectious from 4 days before until 4 days after onset of rash. Maximum communicability occurs from the onset of the prodromal period through the first 3-4 days of rash. Clinical Case Definition: An illness characterized by all of the following: A generalized maculopapular rash lasting 3 or more days. A temperature of at least 101.0o F (38.3o C). Cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis. Case Febrile illness accompanied by generalized maculopapular rash. Probable: a case that meets the clinical case definition, has noncontributory or no serologic or virology testing, and is not epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. Confirmed: a case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. A laboratory- confirmed case does not need to meet the clinical case definition. *Comment: Two probable cases that are epidemiologically linked would be considered confirmed cases, even in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Fact Sheet 2 Confirmed cases should be classified as: Internationally importated case : an internationally imported case is defined as a case in which measles results from ex posure to measles virus outside the United States, as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period (7-21 days before rash onset) occurring outside the U.S. and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering the U.S., and there is no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time. All other cases are considered U.S. acquired U.S.-acquired case: a U.S.-acquired case is defined as a case in which the patient had not been outside the United States during the 21 days before rash onset or was known to have been exposed to measles within the United States. U.S.-acquired cases are subclassified into f our mutually exclusive groups: o Import-linked case : any case in a chain of transmission that is epidemiologically linked to an internationally imported case. o Imported-virus case : a case for which an epidemiologic link to an internationally imported case was not identified, but for which viral genetic evidence indicates an imported measles genotype, i.e., a genotype that is not occurring within the U.S> in a pattern indicative of endemic transmission. An endemic genotype is the genotype of any measles virus that occurs in an endemic chain of transmission (i.e., lasting 12 months). Any genotype that is found repeatedly in U.S.-acquired cases should be thoroughly investigated as potential endemic genotype, especially if the cases are closely related in time or location. o Endemic case : a case for which epidemiological or virological evidence indicates an endemic chain of transmission. Endemic transmission is defined as a chain of measles virus transmission that is continuous for 12 months within the United States. o Unknown source case (indigenous) : case for which an epidemiological or virological link to importation or to endemic transmission within the U.S. cannot be established after a thorough investigation. These cases must be carefully assessed epidemiologically to assure that they do not represent a sustained U.S.-acquired chain of transmission or an endemic chain of transmission within the U.S. Note: Internationally imported, import-linked, and imported-virus cases are considered collectively to be import-associated cases. Note: U.S.-acquired cases may be classified further into two mutually exclusive groups: o Out-of-state importation: an out-of-state imported case is defined as a case in which measles resulted from exposure to measles virus outside of the state of Georgia, as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period (at least 7- 21 days before rash onset) occurring outside of Georgia and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering Georgia, and there is no known exposure to measles in Georgia Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Fact Sheet 3. o In-state acquired: an in-state case is defined as a case in which measles resulted from exposure to measles virus within the state of Georgia, as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period (at least 7-21 days before rash onset) occurring in Georgia Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Positive serologic test for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, or Fourfold rise in acute and convalescent -phase measles IgG antibody levels by any standard serologic assay, or Isolation of measles virus from a clinical specimen, or Detection of measles virus by rt-PCR Diagnostic Testing: (See Measles Specimen Collection and Submission Guidelines) A. Serology 1. Specimen Needed: Blood - 5cc collected during acute phase of illness and 5 cc collected 14-30 days later, or two capillary tubes collected during acute phase and convalescent phase. 2. Outfit: Other serology outfit, order #500 # Lab Performed: Measles IgG (acute and convalescent) and IgM titers. Be sure to request the IgM titer with the acute phase draw so that case confirmation can be accomplished in a timely manner. ( Note : On Form #3432 be sure to request Rubeola (Measles) IgG and IgM AND Rubella IgG and IgM) 5. Lab Performing Test: Immunology Laboratory, Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) in Decatur. 6. Transport requirements: blood must be non-hemolyzed. B. Culture or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 1. Specimen Needed: Urine, heparinized blood, nasopharyngeal aspirates, or throat swabs - collect at same time as samples for serology (best if within 3 days after rash onset). 2. Outfit: Viral transport media - culture: order #575 PCR: order # 565 3. Form: # 3595R. 4. Lab Test Performed: Culture, PCR. 5. Lab Performing Test: Virology Laboratory, GPHL in Decatur -culture, specimen forwarded to CDC for PCR. 6. Transport: Transport at 4 o C if tests are to be performed within 72 hours; otherwise freeze at -70o C. Immunity: Evidence of immunity to measles includes: 1. Born in the United States before 1957 (for healthcare providers this does not suffice as evidence of immunity) 2. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Fact Sheet 4 Vaccination: The current recommendation is a two-dose schedule. The first dose should be given at 12 to 15 months of age, the second at school entry (4 to 6 years of age.) Both doses can be given as MMR or MMRV vaccine. For any child older than six who has not received one or both doses, any opportunity to immunize should be utilized. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Measles vaccine is effective in preventing infection or modifying the severity of illness if given within 72 hours of exposure. Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modify disease and provide temporary protec tion if given within 6 days of exposure. Transmission is likely in households, schools, and other institutions. Immune globulin (IG) may be especially indicated for susceptible contacts in these settings, particularly contacts younger than 1 year of age and immunocompromised contacts. Treatment: Supportive care only. Investigation: Measles and rubella must be ruled out whenever illness involving fever and rash are reported. The investigation must be started immediately when a potential case is identified. Essential components of the case investigation include the following: a. Establish a diagnosis by obtaining laborator y specimens for serology, viral isolation and PCR as early as possible. b. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization history. c. Identify the source of infection and transmission setting. d. Assess potential transmission and identify contacts. e. For symptomatic contacts, obtain specimens for virus isolation and PCR if measles is suspected. f. Refer to GA Department of Public Health website for measles investigation and outbreak protocol http://health.state.ga.us/epi/vpd/measles.asp Initial response to the report of suspected measles: 1. Call the State Epidemiology Section (404) 657-2588 IMMEDIATELY . If after business hours, report suspect case to 1-866- PUB-HLTH. 2. Contact the parent(s) or guardian and reporting physician immediately to obtain a detailed clinical and exposure history of the patient. Ask parent(s) about any out-of-town travel or visitors during the 7-21 days period prior to rash onset. Identify any person(s) or group(s) exposed by the patient during the period 4 days before to 4 days after rash onset. 3. Complete the Measles Surveillance Worksheet (from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, Appendix 10). Read the instructions carefully and complete as much of the form as possible. Do not leave any item blank. If in formation is not available, enter \"none\" or \"NA\".

Do not wait for laboratory confirmation to fax the report. Outbreak Control Strategy: All reports of suspected measles cases should be investigated rapidly. Control activities should not be delayed until laboratory results on suspected cases are received. A measles outbreak exists in a community whenever there is one confirmed case of measles. Once this occurs, preventing dissemination of measles depends on promptly vaccinating susceptible persons and limiting the number of exposures to infectious cases. All persons who cannot readily provide documentati on of measles immunity (see ACIP Statement on Measles Prevention, dated 5/22/98) should be vaccinated or excluded from the setting (e.g. school). Documentation of vaccination is adequate only if the date of vaccination is provided. Persons who have been exempted from measles va ccination for medical or religious reasons should be excluded from the outbreak area for at least 2 weeks after the onset of rash in the last case of measles. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Fact Sheet 6 Institution-based outbreaks During outbreaks in day care centers, elementary, middle, junior and senior high schools, colleges and other institutions of higher education, a program of mandatory revaccination with MMR vaccine should be conducted in the affected schools. Revaccination should include all students and their siblings and all school personnel born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation of receipt of two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of measles immunity. Students and personnel receiving their first dose as part of an outbreak control program may be immediately readmitted to school. A second dose should be given in 28 days. If there is an unconfirmed but clinically compatible case in a school, the response should be phased in. Reimmunization should be recommended but not mandatory until the case is confirmed. Proceed with the epidemiologic work on the case. Search for a source, immunize siblings and close contacts when appropriate, ensure an adequate supply of vaccine and begin to prepare for a school-based clinic. At this point it is very important to implement daily active surveillance of absenteeism of two or more days and any rashes should be followed up on immediately. New cases signal the immediate need for sc hool-based clinics and the exclusion of children and staff who do not have two documented doses of measles vaccine. Outbreaks among preschool-age children The risk of complications from measles is high among infants less than one (1) year of age. Therefore, considering the benefits and risks, vaccination with monovalent measles vaccine is recommended for infants as young as six (6) months of age when exposure to measles is considered likely. Children less than six months of age do not require measles vaccination because they still have passive antibody passed to them from their mother during gestation. MMR may be used in children before the first birthday if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available. Infants vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated when they are 12 months old and at school entry to ensure adequate protection. Medical Settings If an outbreak occurs in a healthcare facility, all employees (including volunteers, trainees, nurses, physicians, technicians, receptionists, and other clerical and support staff) are at an increased risk of exposure to measles, and all persons who work in such facilities in any capacity should be immune to measles to prevent any potential out break. All employees who were born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation of receipt of two doses of measles vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity to measles (see ACIP Statement on Measles Prevention dated 5/22/98) should receive a dose of measles vaccine. Personnel born before 1957 without documentation of measles i mmunity should receive one dose of MMR. Serologic screening of healthcare workers during an outbreak to Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Fact Sheet 7 determine measles immunity is not recommended, because stopping measles transmission requires the rapid vaccination of susceptible healthcare workers, which can be impeded by the need to screen and wait for results. Susceptible personnel who have been expos ed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the 5th to the 21st day after the exposure, regardless of whether they received vaccine or immunoglobulin after the exposure. Those who become ill should be relieved from patient contact for seven days after they develop a rash. Reporting: Report all suspected, probable, or confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the State Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 9 MEASLES measles, red measles) What is measles? Measles (rubeola) is an acute, highly contagious viral disease capable of producing epidemics. Pneumonia occurs in up to six percent of reported cases and accounts for 60 percent of deaths attributed to measles. Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) may also occur. Other complications include middle ear infection and convulsions. Measles is more common in winter and spring. Very few, if any, cases of measles occur in Georgia each year. Who gets measles? Although measles is usually considered to be a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age. Generally, inadequately immunized preschool children, adolescents, and young adults comprise the majority of measles cases in the United States. How is measles spread? Measles is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions from an infected person or, less frequently, by airborne transmission. Measles is one of the most highly communicable infectious diseases. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles symptoms generally appear in two stages. In the first stage, the individual may have a runny nose, cough and a slight fever. The eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever consistently rises each day. The second stage begins on the third to seventh day and consists of a temperature at or above 101 F, and a red blotchy rash lasting four to seven days. The rash usually begins on the face and then spreads over the entire body. Koplik spots (little white spots) may also appear on the gums and inside of the cheeks. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms usually appear 10 to 12 days after exposure, although they may occur as early as 7 or as late as 21 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread measles? An individual is able to transmit measles from four days before to four days after rash onset. Does past infection make a person immune? Yes. Permanent immunity is acquired after contracting the disease. What is the treatment for measles? There is no specific treatment for measles. How can measles be prevented? Anyone born on or after January 1, 1957, who does not have a history of physician-diagnosed measles or serologic confirmation of measle s immunity, should receive two doses of MMR vaccine for maximum protection. The first dos e should be given at 12 months of age. The second dose should be given at four to six years of age (school entry) at the same time as the DTaP and polio booster doses. The MMR vaccine is recommended for all routine measles GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 10 vaccine doses to provide increased protection against all three vaccine-preventable diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. Two doses of measles-containing vaccine are required of all children enrolled in schools, grades K-12. College students also are required to demonstrate immunity against measles. For more detailed vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Where can I get additional information on measles?

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Measles Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 11 MEASLES: SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES A case of measles is a public health emergency . Contact public health immediately of any suspect cases. A clinical diagnosis of measles is unreli able; suspect cases of measles must be laboratory confirmed. Confirmation of acute infection can be determined by the presence of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and a four-fold rise in serum immunoglobul in G (IgG) titer between acute and convalescent phase specimens. The Georgia Division of Public Health strongly recommends the collection of serum for measles IgM/IgG and collection of a throat swab and urine specimen for viral isolation/polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) to confirm a measles case . To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory submission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions: Serologic Testing : Collect as soon as possible when measles infection is suspected, preferably at the onset of rash. Collect 7-10 ml of blood in a red top or serum separator tube (SST) Acute serum (IgM and Convalescent (second IgG) -collect weeks after rash onset SST tubes must be centrifuged and the serum poured into a transport tube for shipment. Keep specimens cold (4o C or 39o F) and ship overnight service. Do not freeze serum samples. Viral Testing: Collect a urine and throat swab at the same ti me as serology. Virus is most frequently recovered within the first 3 days following rash, but up to 7 days after rash onset is acceptable. If it's been a few days since resolution of the rash collect only a urine specimen. Throat Swabs Use a viral transport kit if possible (such as what's used to isolate influenza or herpes simplex virus) Collect a throat swab by rubbing the posterior nasal passages with a dry sterile cotton swab Place swab in a tube containing 2-3 mls of viral transport medium or other sterile isotonic solution (phosphate buffered saline or cell culture medium). Keep samples cold (4o C or 39o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ice*. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Urine Specimens Collect 10-15 ml of urine in a screw top sterile container Keep samples cold (4o C or 39o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ice*. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. *If shipment contains both serum and viral specimens, ship together by overnight service on cold packs (do not freeze serum) GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6.

A positive IgM test result indicates current/very recent infection or rein fection. As with any lab test, there can be false positive test results. o IgG: IgG alone is not diagnostic unless you obtain both an acute (can be done as soon after onset as the patient is seen, but ideally four to five days after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (from two to four weeks a fter onset) blood specimen for serologic tests to determine if a four-fold rise in IgG anti body titer has occurred (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:320). In vaccinated persons it may not be possible to detect a four-fold rise in measles IgG antibody titer in paired serum samples (acute and convalescent). In such persons, the existing IgG will begin to rise soon after exposur e and infection. At the time of onset of symptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, and obviate the four-fold rise observed in convalescent serum specimen.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Mumps Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Mumps virus. Brief Description: An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid gland or other salivary gland(s) (parotitis), and without other apparent cause. Symptoms such as myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever may precede parotitis by several days. Asymptomatic infections also occur; parotitis is present in only 30-40% of infected persons. Not all cases of parotitis - especially sporadic ones - are due to mumps infection; however, mumps is the only known cause of epidemic parotitis. Complications can include meningitis, arthritis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, inflammation of the pancreas and deafness. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Airborne, by droplet spread, or by direct contact with saliva of an infected person. Incubation Period: Commonly 14 to 18 days, range 14 to 25 days. Period of Communicability: Persons with mumps are usually considered infectious from 2 days before until 4 days after onset of parotitis. Virus has been isolated from saliva from 7 days before parotitis and 9 days after onset of illness. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary gland(s), lasting greater than or equal to 2 days, and without other apparent cause. Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of mumps virus from clinical specimen, or Detection of mumps nucleic acid (e.g. rt-PCR assay), or Positive serologic test for mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, or A fourfold increase between acute- and convalescent-phase titers in serum mumps immunoglobulin Diagnostic Testing: A.

Probable : a case that meets the clinical case definition, without laboratory confirmation, and is epidemiologically linked to a clinically compatible case. Confirmed : a case that meets the clinical case definition or has clinically compatible illness and is either laboratory confirmed or is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. *Comment : False-positive IgM results by immunofluorescent antibody assays have been reported. Other serologic tests include Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA or EIA) and Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI). Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Mumps Fact Sheet 3 Vaccination: Live attenuated mumps virus vaccine is recommended for persons > 12 months of age unless medically contraindicated or unless a person is immune as defined by documentation of 1) immunization with at least one dose of live mumps vaccine on or after the first birthday, 2) serological evidence of mumps immunity, 3) physician diagnosis of mumps, or 4) birth before 1957. Under the current 2-dose schedule, most children and adolescents receive two doses of mumps-containing vaccine. Mumps vaccine, as MMR or MMRV, is recommended at 12-15 months of age and 4-6 years of age. For more detailed vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: There is no evidence that giving mumps vaccine provides protection to those already exposed. However, in those susceptible persons who were exposed but not infected, the vaccine will provide future immunity, and its use in these situations is not contraindicated. Treatment: Supportive only. Investigation: 1. Call the State Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588 to report a suspect case. Complete the Mumps Surveillance Worksheet (from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, Appendix 8). Identification of suspected or confirmed cases of mumps is important in the initiation of control measures to prevent the spread of disease among susceptible persons. Essential components of the case investigation include the following: a. Establish a diagnosis of mumps (submi t specimens for serology, PCR, viral culture). b. Obtain accurate and complete immunization histories. c. Identify the source of infection. d. Assess potential transmission and identify contacts. e. Obtain specimens for virus isolation. 2. Fax the completed surveillance worksheet and any pertinent lab results to the Notifiable Disease Epidemiology Section (404) 657-7517. Outbreak Control: The main strategy for controlling a mumps outbreak is to define the at-risk population and transmission setting, and to rapidly identify and vaccinate susceptible persons or, if a contraindication exists, to exclude susceptible persons from the setting to prevent exposure and transmission. Reporting: Report all probable or confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the State Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588. If calling after regular business hours, it is very import ant to report cases to the Epidemiology Section answering service or call 1-866 PUB-HLTH.

Surveillance And Reporting -10/2012 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus that can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, but is most often associated with meningitis. Meningococcal serogrouping is based on the antigenic structure of the polysaccharide capsule, with five serogroups causing the majority of disease: A, B, C, Y, and W-135. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Spread through respiratory droplets, normally requiring direct contact with saliva and respiratory secretions. Up to 5%-10% of people may be asymptomatic carriers with nasopharyngeal colonization. Incubation Period: 2 to 10 days, commonly 3-4 days Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of N. meningitidis from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or less commonly, joint fluid). Invasive disease may take a variety of forms, including septicemia, m eningitis, pneumonia, or septic arthritis. Diagnostic testing: 1. Specimen: Blood, CSF, or other sterile site for culture; pure specimen for typing 2. Outfits: sterile vial for isolation and identification; culture referral order #0505 for serotyping 3. 4.

Cases are considered non-infectious 24 hours after starting effective antibiotic therapy. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 6. Surveillance And Reporting -10/2012 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact is caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. These bacteria are found only in humans. These are multiple meningococcal serogroups (types) but the most important of these are A, B, C, Y, & W-135. The two most common forms of meningococcal disease are meningitis, a bacterial infection of the fluid and covering of the spinal cord and brain; and septicemia, an infection of the bloodstream. Who is at risk? Risk groups for meningococcal disease include household contacts of case patients, military recruits, college freshmen living in dormitories, persons without a functional spleen or with complement component deficiency (a specific immune system problem), and people exposed to tobacco smoke. Rates of meningococcal disease are highest during infancy, then fall during childhood, and rise again during adolescence. How are meningococcal bacteria spread? The bacteria are transmitted from person-to-pers on in secretions from the nose and throat. They are not spread by casual contact or by si mply breathing the air near an infected person, but require close contact. The bacteria can live outside the body for only a few minutes; so, if the germs contaminate a desk or book, they soon die and won't infect a person who touches it later. As many as 2 in 10 people carry the bacteria in the back of the nose and throat at any given time, especially in winter. Why only a very small number of those who have the bacteria in their nose and throat develop disease, while others remain healthy, is not understood. What are the symptoms? Meningitis is characterized by high fever, headache, and stiff neck. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, confusion, sleepiness, and sensitivity to light. Sepsis causes high fever, low blood pressure, and severe malaise. Meningococcal sepsis is sometimes associated with a characteristic petechial or purpuric rash. Petechiae are pinpoint spots that do not blanch with pressure, and purpura are patches of bluish discoloration similar to bruises. Both are caused by bleeding into the skin. Who should be vaccinated? The Advisory committee on Immunization Practi ces (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of all persons aged 11-18 years. College freshmen living in dormitories are also at increased risk for disease and should be vaccinated with MCV4 before college entry if they have not been vaccinated previously, or given a booster dose if they are vaccinated before the age of 16. ACIP also recommends that persons age 2 to 55 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease be vaccinated with MCV4; MPSV4 is recommended for adults 56 years and older who are increased risk. This includes travelers to or residents of countries in which the disease is hyperendemic or epi demic, and individuals who have terminal complement component deficiencies or asplenia. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 6. Surveillance And Reporting -10/2012 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact Sheet 3 Does the vaccine prevent all meningococcal disease? No, currently available vaccines do not protect against serogroup B meningococcal disease. How can serogroup B meningococcal disease be prevented? General meningococcal prevention measur es include avoiding first and second-hand tobacco smoke, using cough etiquette, and minimizing shared saliva. Vaccination: A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) was licensed in 1981 to protect against serogroups A, C, Y and W-135, for persons ages 2 years and older. In 2005, a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was licensed for use in persons ages 11 to 55, which protects against the same four serogroups. MCV4 is the preferred product for persons ages 2 through 55, and MPSV4 should be used for adults 56 and older. The first dose of MCV4 is recommended at age 11-12, with a booster dose at 16-18. Only one dose of MCV4 is recommended for adults ages 19-21 who will be attending college, if previously unvaccinated. Persons ages 2 through 55 with persistent complement component deficiency or asplenia should receive an initial series of 2 doses of MCV4, 2 months apart, with a booster every 5 years. Persons with comple ment component deficiencies or asplenia age 56 and older should receive one dose of MPSV4 an d a booster every 5 years. There is no vaccine to prevent serogroup B and non-groupable disease. Investigation: The Bacterial Meningitis and Sepsis Investigation and Control Manual should be used to investigate suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of Neisseria meningitidis. Household members and close contacts in the 7 days before illness onset should be given prophylactic antibiotics; close cont act is defined as having direct contact with saliva and respiratory secretions, such as kissing, sharing utensils or beverages, etc. The risk of secondary cases is highest within a few days after the index case occurs, but after 14 days, risk of secondary disease returns to baseline and prophylaxis is of little value. 1. Prophylaxis and Follow- Up of Contacts: Prophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible after exposure to a meningococcal disease case, and must occur within 14 days. Ciprofloxacin 500 to 750 mg PO once may be given to adults >18 years of age to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis . Do not give to pregnant or lactating women 2. Rifampin is the preferred antibiotic for children and non-pregnant adults: Non-pregnant adults: 600 mg PO q12h for 4 doses Infants and children > 1 months: 10mg/kg (maximum 600mg) PO q12h for 4 doses Infants < 1 month old: Rifampin 5mg/kg PO q12h for 4 doses 3. Ceftriaxone should be given if the client cannot take Rifampin: Adults and children age 15 or older: 250 mg IM, once Children < 15 years old: 125mg IM, once Immunization with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine should be recommended according to the guidelines above and especially during an outbreak of a vaccine- preventable strain.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Pertussis Fact Sheet 1 Agent: The bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Brief Description: An acute bacterial infection involving the respiratory tract. The initial (catarrhal) stage has insidious onset with irritati ng cough that can progress to severe paroxysms of cough (paroxysmal stage). Paroxysms are characterized by a series of many coughs without intervening inhalation, often followed by a high-pitched inspiratory \"whoop\" and vomiting. Disease in infants younger than 6 months of age may be atypical; apnea is a common manifestation and whoop is often absent. Similarly, older children and adults can have atypical manifestations, with persistent cough and no whoop. In recent years in the United States, pertussis has been recognized with increasing frequency in adolescents and young adults. Many of these cases occur in previously i mmunized persons and indicate waning immunity following immunization. Complications of pertussis include seizures, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and death. Disease rates and risk of serious complications, including death, are highest among young children, particularly those younger than 1 year of age. Reservoir: Humans are believed to be the only host. Mode of Transmission: By direct contact with discharges from respiratory mucous membranes of infected persons by the airborne route, probably by droplets. Incubation Period: Commonly 7 to 10 days, range 4 to 21 days Clinical Case Definition: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, a cough illness lasting greater than or equal to 2 weeks with one of the following: paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory \"whoop,\" or post-tussive vomiting Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: 1. Isolation of B. pertussis from a clinical specimen 2. Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B. pertussis Diagnostic Testing: 1. Culture and PCR are recommended for pertussis diagnosis. 2. Specimen needed: Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs should be collected as soon as possible after illness onset, preferably before antibiotic treatment. 3. See Appendix 1 for specimen collection and submission details and http://health.state.ga.us/epi/vpd/pertussis.asp Case Classification: Probable: meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case Confirmed: a case that is culture positive and in which an acute cough illness of any duration is present; or a case that meets the clinical case definition and is confirmed by positive PCR; or a case that meet s the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked directly to a case confirmed by either culture or PCR Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health PERTUSSIS FACT SHEET (WHOOPING COUGH) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Pertussis Fact Sheet 2 Period of Communicability: Highly communicable in the early catarrhal stage before paroxysmal cough. Thereafter communicability gradually decreases and becomes negligible after about 3 weeks (21 days), despite persisting spasmodic cough. When treated with appropriate antibiotics, the period of infectiousness is usually 5 days after onset of therapy. Vaccination: Beginning in 1996 acellular pertussis vaccines were recommended for all doses in the pertussis vaccine series, replacing the whole-cell vaccines which previously had been used. All acellular vaccines are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTaP vaccine). Children should receive four doses of vaccine, with the first three doses administered at 4- to 8-week intervals, beginning at 6 weeks to 2 months of age. The fourth dose should be given 6-12 months after the third dose (17-20 months for Daptacel). Children who receive four doses of DTaP before their fourth birthday should receive a booster dose of DTaP at 4 to 6 years of age. In children younger than seven years old, DTaP vaccines efficacy ranges from 71% to 84%. Tdap vaccine is a formulation licensed for use in persons ages 10-64, and should be given as a one-time dose in lieu of a booster dose of Td. For more detailed vaccination information for either Tdap or DTaP, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Investigation: I. Obtain the following information immediately in order to perform a risk assessment to gauge index of suspicion. 1. Immunization history 2. Exposure history (any possibility the suspect case was around a confirmed or probable case of pertussis 21 days prior to becoming ill) 3. Obtain detailed description of the clinical presentation: History of cough including onset date Onset of coryza, cyanosis, whoop, post-tussive vomiting or presence of apnea. II. Confirm the diagnosis. See \"Diagnostic Testing\" section. III. Conduct epidemiology investigation* 1. Ensure isolation of case and counsel immediate contacts to avoid contact with high- risk groups until 5 days of antibiotic treatment is completed. 2. Determine period of communicability (one week before to three weeks after cough onset) 3. Interview case to identify possible contacts (i.e. household, school, childcare, work, healthcare facility). Specific definitions of contact will vary according to the situation. Transmission occurs by close contact with a case via aerosolized droplets and can be expected with: Direct face-to-face contact for a period (not defined) with a case who is symptomatic (e.g., in the catarrhal or paroxysmal period of illness) Shared confined space in close proximity for a prolonged period of time, such as 3 hour, with a symptomatic case. Chemoprophylaxis should be provided to all household contacts regardless of vaccination history; and anyone with prolonged close contact with a case (several hours in a confined space). Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health PERTUSSIS FACT SHEET (WHOOPING COUGH) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Pertussis Fact Sheet 3 4. Refer contacts to health department, pharmacy or primary care physician for prophylaxis. 5. If period of prophylaxis has passed (21 days, except in high risk cases), counsel contacts to call their health provider if they develop respiratory symptoms and/or cough. 6. Work with Georgia Department of Public Health and State Pharmacy (District pharmacies in certain Districts) to ensure availability of adequate antibiotics for contacts. IV. Conduct surveillance for secondary cases and contacts. * Note that the steps are not ordered by priority si nce several of these steps are conducted simultaneously. Treatment and Prophylaxis: The following treatment/prophylaxis re commendations are from \"Recommended Antimicrobial Agents for the Treatment and Postexposure Prophylaxis of Pertussis, 2005 CDC Guidelines\" (see citation). The choice of antimicrobial for treatment or prophylaxis should take into account effectiveness, safety (including the potential for adverse events and drug interactions), tolerability, ease of adherence to the regimen prescribed, and cost. All close contacts of cases should receive chemoprophylaxis regardless of their immunization status. Please refer to the article for additional details regarding treatment and prophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pubs-tools/pubs-textbooks.html or see citation).

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Pertussis Specimen Coll ection & Submission 6 APPENDIX 1: PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION Specimen Collection A swab of nasopharyngeal secretions is the optimal specimen for confirming a pertussis diagnosis. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible after onset of illness, preferably before antibiotic treatment. Dacron , rayon, or nylon-flocked (not cotton or calcium alginate) swabs are superior to other types of swabs and are recommended. A culture is the preferred test to confirm pertussis and requires a special transport medium (Regan-Lowe). The State Epidemiology Section currently distributes Regan-Lowe media to the District Health Departments regularly. Alternative diagnostics, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are useful as an adjunct but should not replace culture particularly for definitive diagnosis such as in an outbreak situation. Please consult with the State Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588 for questions about diagnostics for pertussis. Regan-Lowe Media Regan-Lowe medium is used to transport specimens to the laboratory for culture and is available in each District. The medium should be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 C. Regan- Lowe medium should be removed from the refrigerator and warmed to room temperature before use. Consult the District Epidemiologist and/or the State Epidemiology Section to obtain Regan-Lowe media. Nasopharyngeal Swab Procedure and Specimen Preparation 1. Immobilize the patient's head. 2. Pass nasopharyngeal swab very gently into a nostril until the posterior nares is reached. 3. Leave the swab in place for up to 10 seconds (this may induce a cough and in practice only a few seconds may be possible.) If resistance is encountered during insertion of the swab, remove it and attempt insertion on the opposite nostril. 4. Remove the swab slowly. Insert and immerse swab into the Regan-Lowe transport medium. 5. Cut the handle end of the swab extending above the transport tube if necessary and cap the container tightly. 6. Label the Regan-Lowe tube with the patient's name and date of specimen collection. 7. A second swab (Dacron, polyester or rayon) must be used for a PCR test. Follow steps 1 - 4 for specimen collection. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Pertussis Questions & Answers 8 PERTUSSIS Q&A (Whooping cough) What is pertussis? Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly contagious disease involving the respiratory tract. It is caused by a bacterium that is found in the mouth, nose and throat of an infected person. Who gets pertussis? Pertussis can occur at any age. Seventy-five percent of reported cases occur in children under five years of age and 50 percent of these are in children under one year of age. However, pertussis can occur in adolescents and adults because of waning immunity, and may manifest as milder illness. How is pertussis spread? Pertussis is primarily spread by direct contact with discharges from the nose and throat of infected individuals or by contact with airborne droplets of respiratory secretions. Frequently, older siblings who may be harboring the bacteria in their nose and throat can bring the disease home and infect an infant in the household. What are the symptoms of pertussis? Pertussis begins as a mild upper respiratory infection. Initially, symptoms resemble those of a common cold, including sneezing, runny nose, low-grade fever and a mild cough. Within two weeks, the cough becomes more severe and is characterized by episodes of numerous rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop. These episodes may recur for one to two months, and are more frequent at night. Older people or partially immunized children generally have milder symptoms. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? The incubation period is usually 7 to 10 days but can be anywhere from 4 to 21 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread pertussis? A person can transmit pertussis from seven days following exposure to three weeks after the onset of coughing episodes. The period of communicability is reduced to five days once antibiotic therapy is begun. Does past infection with pertussis make a person immune? No. Immunity from disease or vaccination is not lifelong but lasts approximately 7-10 years. What are the complications associated with pertussis? Complications of pertussis may include pneumonia, middle ear infection, dehydration, loss of appetite, seizures, encephalopathy (disorders of the brain), apneic episodes (brief cessation of breathing) and death. What is the treatment for pertussis? Antibiotics may be given to shorten the period of time that an infected person can transmit the infection to others, but antibiotics do not reduce symptoms except when given before or shortly after symptoms develop. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health PERTUSSIS QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Pertussis Questions & Answers 9 How can pertussis be prevented? The single most effective control measure is maintaining the highest possible level of immunization in the community. The vaccine for pertussis is usually given in combination with diphtheria and tetanus. For more detailed vaccination information for either Tdap or DTaP, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment of cases with certain antibiotics such as azithromycin can shorten the contagious period. People who have or may have pertussis should stay away from young children and infants until properly treated. Where can I get additional information on pertussis? Contact the Georgia Division of Public H ealth, Epidemiology Branch, by email at gaepinfo@dhr.state.ga.us .

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3. Brief Description: A highly contagious viral infection with manifestations ranging from inapparent infection to non-specific febrile ill ness, aseptic meningitis, paralytic disease and death. Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, gastrointestinal upset, malaise, and stiffness of neck and back. In approximately 0.1% to 2% of cases, symptoms include a flaccid paralysis typified by absent deep tendon reflexes; in approximately 1 out of 250 cases, residual neurologic symptoms occur, including paralysis. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Primarily person-to-person spread, principally through the fecal-oral route but also by the respiratory route; fecal-oral transmission occurs in situations where sanitation is poor. However, where sanitation is good, pharyngeal spread may be more apparent. In rare instances, milk, foodstuffs and other materials contaminated with feces have been incriminated as vehicles. There is no reliab le evidence of spread by insects; sewage and water are rarely implicated. Incubation Period: Usually 6 to 20 days, with a range of 3 to 35 days. Clinical Case Definition: Acute onset of a flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs, without other apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Case confirmation is based on a clinical definition. However, a probable case can be supported by l aboratory information. Diagnosis is made by isolation of the organism from throat, stool, rectum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood. The highest probability of isolation is achieved when two stool and throat specimens are obtained twenty-four hours apart. These should be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory for primary isolation. The state laboratory will forward isolates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for Polymerase Chain R eaction (PCR) and antibody blocking testing to determine intratypic variation. This will determine whether a paralytic polio case is derived from wild-type or vaccine related virus. Diagnostic Testing: A. Culture 1. Specimen Needed: Stool, throat swab, rectal swab, CSF, or blood. 2. Outfit: Viral culture outfit, order #575. 3. Form: 3595. 4. Lab Test Performed: Isolation and identification of poliovirus. 5. Lab Performing Test: State Virology Laboratory, Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) in Decatur, followed by intratypic differentiation performed at the CDC. 6. Transport Requirements: Collect within 72 hours of onset of symptoms; specimens should be frozen immediately and shipped on dry ice. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Fact Sheet 2 Comment: Isolation of wild-type virus constitutes a public health emergency and appropriate control measures must be initiated immediately (in consultation between health care providers, state and local health departments, and CDC). B. Serology 1. Specimen Needed: Acute and convalescent sera, or whole blood. a. Acute sera: 2-3 cc collected as soon as possible after onset of illness. b. Convalescent sera: 2-3 cc whole blood collected 14-21 days after acute phase of illness. 2. Outfit: Serology, order #504. 3. Form: antibody titers to poliovirus serotype 1, 2, and 3. 5. Lab Performing Test: CDC with prior arrangement by the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Do not submit specimens directly to CDC. All specimens must be submitted to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Case Classification: Probable: A case that meets the clinical case definition. Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and in which the patient has a neurologic deficit 60 days after onset of initial symptoms, has died, or has unknown follow-up status. Vaccination: There are two types of polio vaccine: the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). The IPV is given intr amuscularly or subcutaneously, and OPV, a live attenuated virus, is given orally. The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a four-dose schedule of IPV for routine immunization of infants and children. The first three are given at two-month intervals begi nning at 2 months of age (the third dose can be given between 6 and 18 months.) The fourth dose is given at age 4 to 6 years, before entering school. For more detailed vaccination information see Polio Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is no longer routinely recommended in the United States because of the continued risk for vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), the absence of indigenous disease, and the low risk for wild poliovirus importation into the United States. OPV is no longer available for routine vaccination in the U.S. Most adults in the United States are at low risk for polio due to immunizations received in childhood. Certain adults are at high risk however, and should be vaccinated. These adults are: 1. Travelers to areas or countries where polio may be epidemic or endemic. 2. Members of communities with disease caused by wild-type polio. 3. Laboratory workers handling specimens that may contain wild-type polio. 4. Health-care personnel in close contact with patients who may be excreting wild-type polio. 5. Unvaccinated adults whose children will be receiving oral poliovirus vaccine. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Fact Sheet 3 Period of Communicability: Not accurately known, but transmission is possible as long as virus is excreted. Virus is demonstrable in the throat as early as 36 hours after exposure and in the feces 72 hours after exposure to infection in both clinical and inapparent cases. Virus persists in the throat for approximately 1 week and in the feces for 3 to 6 weeks or longer. Cases are most infectious during the first few days before and after onset of symptoms. Treatment: None except attention during the acute illness to the complications of paralysis. Investigation: The State Epidemiology Section will give instructions regarding investigation when a case is reported by phone. The following information should be collected as part of the investigation: 1. Demographic Information : The name, age, sex, race, occupation, and address (county, city and zip code) of the patient. 2. Immunization History : The number, dates and lot numbers of previous doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and the number, dates, type (monovalent versus trivalent) and lot numbers of previous doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Information on the number, site and types of injections given at either the time of vaccination or within 30 days after vaccination should also be collected. 3. Clinical Information : A brief description of the patient's illness including the date of onset of paralysis. Information should include the course of the illness and the sites of paralysis or other complications. 4. Immunologic Status : Since persons with some immune deficiency diseases are at increased risk of paralytic poliomyelitis, known immune deficiency either in the patient or patient's family should be documented. If any doubt exists, an immunologic evaluation (quantitative immunoglobulins, T and B cell quantitation, lymphocyte transformation, etc.) should be considered. 5. Exposure History : a. History of recent travel of the patient or a close contact outside of the United States to an endemic or epidemic area for poliomyelitis. b. History of contact with any known cases of poliomyelitis and the date of contact, if applicable. c. History of receipt of OPV by the patient within 30 days prior to onset, including the date of receipt and the lot number of the vaccine. d. History of contact within 30 days prior to onset of symptoms with any person who received OPV within the last 60 days prior to onset, including the date of contact, the nature of the contact, the date the contact received OPV, the lot number of the vaccine, the age of the contact, and the relationship to the patient. Information regarding the contact's prior history of immunization with IPV should also be collected.

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Questions And Answer 5 POLIOMYELITIS Q&A (Infantile paralysis, Polio) What is polio? Polio is a viral disease that may affect the central nervous system. Complications include paralysis (most commonly of the legs). Paralysis of the muscles of respiration and swallowing can be fatal. Since polio immunization has become widespread, cases of polio are very rare. Who gets polio? Polio is more common in infants and young children and occurs under conditions of poor hygiene. However, paralysis is more common and more severe when infection occurs in older individuals. In exceedingly rare cases, oral polio vaccine can cause paralytic polio in a person who receives the vaccine (one in every 2.4 million doses). How is polio spread? Polio is predominately spread from person to person through the fecal-oral route when community or personal hygiene is imperfect. What are the symptoms of polio? Infection with poliovirus can range from inapparent to a severe paralytic disease that may result in death. Symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, nausea and vomiting, excruciating muscle pain and stiffness in the neck and back. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? The incubation period is usually 6 to 20 days, with a range of 3 to 35 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread the poliovirus? Patients are most infectious from 7 to 10 days before and after the onset of symptoms. However, patients are potentially contagious as long as the virus is present in the throat and feces. The virus persists in the throat for approximately one week after onset of illness and is excreted in feces for several weeks or, occasionally, months. Does past infection with polio make a person immune? There are three types of poliovirus. Lifelong immunity usually depends on which type of virus one is infected with. Second attacks are rare and result from infection with a poliovirus of a different type than the first attack. What is the treatment for polio? There is presently no cure for polio. Treatment involves supportive care. How can polio be prevented? Maintaining high levels of polio immunization in the community is the single most effective preventive measure. Two types of polio vaccine are available: trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). However, in the United States IPV is the vaccine of choice and OPV is not readily available. Contact the Georgia Immunization Program at 404-657-3158 for current vaccine recommendations.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Rubella virus. Brief Description: A mild febrile viral disease with a diffuse punctate (pinpoint) and maculopapular rash sometimes resembling that of measles or scarlet fever. Children usually present few or no constitutional symptoms, but adults may experience a 1 to 5 day prodrome of low grade fever, headache, malaise, mild coryza, and conjunctivitis. Rubella is important because of its ability to produce anomalies in the developing fetus. These abnormalities are termed Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). Congenital rubella syndrome occurs when a pregnant mother becomes infected and passes the virus to her fetus. The primary congenital defects are ophthalmologic (cataracts, glaucoma, retinopathy), disorders, meningoencephalitis, mental retardation). Other congenital defects include radiolucent bone disease and growth retardation. The occurrence of these defects is 50% if the mother is infected in the first month of pregnancy, 20% to 30% if infected in the second month and 5% if infected in the third to fourth month. Defects are rare when maternal infection occurs after the 20 th week. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Contact with nasopharyngeal secretions of infected persons. Infection is transmitted by droplet spread or direct contact with patients. Infants with congenital rubella syndrome shed large quantities of virus from body secretions for up to one year, and can therefore serve as a source of infection for susceptible persons caring for them. Rubella may also be transmitted by sub-clinical cases (approximately 30% to 50% of all rubella infections). Incubation Period: 14 days, with a range of 12 to 23 days. Period of Communicability: Rubella is moderately contagious. The disease is most contagious as the rash is erupting, but can be transmitted about 1 week before to 5-7 days after onset of rash. Infected children should be excluded from school until 7 days after rash onset. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with ALL of the following characteristics: Acute onset of generalized maculopapular rash, and Temperature > 37.2 C ( 99 F), if measured, and Arthralgia, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, or conjunctivitis. Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of rubella virus, or Positive serologic test for rubella IgM antibody, or Significant rise in rubella IgG antibody level by any standard serologic assay, or PCR positive for rubella virus Diagnostic Testing: A. Serology 1. Specimen: Blood - acute sera (at least 5cc whole blood) for IgM and IgG titers collected at the onset of illness and convalescent sera (IgG) collected 14-21 days later. Please note that a single IgM test will confirm the diagnosis. False-positive Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 2 rubella IgM tests have been found in persons with parvovirus infections, a positive heterophile test for infectious mononucleosis, or a positive rheumatoid factor. 2. Outfits: Other serology outfit, order #504. Test Performed: Titers for Rubella - IgG and IgM (must write IgM request on the form). 5. Lab Performing Test: Immunology Laboratory, Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) in Decatur. 6. Transport Requirements: Sera can be kept at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen. Specimen should be non-hemolyzed. B. Culture / Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 1. Specimen: Nasopharyngeal swab/aspirate, throat, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 2. Outfit: Viral transport media. 3. Form: #3595. 4. Lab Test Performed: Culture or PCR. 5. Lab Performing Test: Virology Laboratory, GPHL in Decatur. 6. Transport Requirements: Specimen shoul d be kept in viral transport medium. Case Classification: Suspect : any generalized rash illness of acute onset. Probable: a case that fits the clinical case definition, has no or noncontributory serologic or virologic testing, and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. Confirmed : a case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. Note : Cases meeting the measles case definition are excluded. Also excluded are cases with serology that is compatible with recent measles virus infection. All rubella cases should be confirmed by a laboratory test (serology). Vaccination: Children should receive rubella vaccine at 12-15 months of age, and 4-6 years of age. It is usually given combined with measles and mumps vaccine as MMR or MMRV. Adults born in 1957 or later should receive at least one dose of MMR vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one MMR, or other acceptable evidence (laboratory results) of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. Efforts should be made to identify and vaccinate susceptible adolescents and adults, particularly women of childbearing age who are not pregnant. Women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant within one month should not receive the vaccine, due to the theoretical risk for causing birth defects in the developing fetus. Emphasize vaccinating susceptible males and females in colleges, employment and health care settings. For more detailed vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 3 Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Live attenuated vaccine given after exposure has not been demonstrated to prevent illness. However, non-pregnant people exposed to rubella may still theoretically benefit from the vaccine if given up to three days after exposure. Immunization of a person who is incubating natural rubella or who already is immune is not associated with increased risk of adverse effects. The risk of congenital rubella when a pregnant woman is exposed is significant. Exposed pregnant women should not be given live virus vaccine. An intramuscular dose of 20 ml of immune globulin (IG) may decrease clinically apparent infection, but no studies show that such a dose protects the fetus. It should only be used in cases where therapeutic abortion is not an option. Treatment: None. Investigation: Case Investigation: 1. Establish a diagnosis : Because the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable, cases must be confirmed by a laboratory test. 2. For adult women, obtain accurate pregnancy status : All women of childbearing age should be evaluated for pregnancy status. If a pregnant woman is infected, immediate referral to her medical care provider is necessary. 3. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization history . 4. Identify the source of infection : Case-patients and their caregivers should be asked about contact with other known cases. Since 20%-50% of cases are asymptomatic, identification of a source will not always be possible. 5. Assess potential for transmission and identify contacts : Contacts of case-patients during the infectious period (7 days before to 7 days after rash onset) should be identified. Transmission can occur in households, communities, workplaces, and prisons. 6. Obtain specimens for virus isolation : Nasopharyngeal swabs and urine should be collected within 4 days after rash onset and submitted for virus isolation. Isolates are essential to identify virus types and track the epidemiology of rubella in the United States, especially as we progress towards elimination of the virus in geographical regions. 7. Laboratory evaluation of exposed pregnant women: Pregnant women who have been exposed should have serologic testing (an IgG and IgM test) at the time of exposure, an IgG titer 2 to 3 weeks later, and another IgG titer 6 weeks after exposure. If the first IgG test is positive, the woman is immune. If the first test is negative, the second and third test will determine whether infection has occurred in the absence of an IgM test. A positive IgM indicates a recent or acute infection. 8. Pregnancy Outcome Registry for women diagnosed with rubella during pregnancy : All pregnant women infected with rubella during pregnancy should be monitored to document the pregnancy outcome (e.g., termination, CRS, or normal infant) on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Form 71.17, \"Congenital Rubella Case Report Form,\" and forward to the State Epidemiology Section. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 4Outbreak Investigation: Strategies to control rubella outbreaks include defining at-risk populations, ensuring susceptibles are rapidly vaccinated, and maintaining active surveillance for new cases. Outbreak control measures should be implemented immediately when one case of rubella is confirmed in a community.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Questions & Answers 5 RUBELLA Q&A (German measles) What is rubella? Rubella is a viral disease characterized by slight fever, rash and swollen glands. Very few to no cases are reported in Georgia each year. Who gets rubella? In unvaccinated populations, rubella is primarily a childhood disease. Where children are well immunized, adolescent and adult infections become more evident. Rubella occurs more frequently in winter and spring. How is rubella spread? Rubella is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected individuals. What are the symptoms of rubella? Rubella is a mild illness that may present with few or no symptoms. Symptoms may include a rash, slight fever, joint aches, headache, discomfort, runny nose and reddened eyes. The lymph nodes just behind the ears and at the back of the neck may swell causing some soreness and/or pain. The rash, which may be itchy, first appears on the face and progresses from head to foot, lasting about three days. As many as half of all rubella cases occur without a rash. How soon do symptoms appear? The incubation period for rubella ranges from 12 to 23 days. However, in most cases symptoms appear within 14 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread rubella? Rubella may be transmitted from seven days before to four days after the onset of rash. Does past infection with rubella make a person immune? Yes. Immunity acquired after contracting the disease is usually permanent. When is the vaccine for rubella needed? Rubella vaccine is given on or after a child's first birthday, but is recommended at 12 months of age when given in combination with measles vaccine. The vaccine can be given alone or in a one-shot combination vaccine that protects against measles, A second dose of MMR is recommended at age 4 to 6 years, to produce immunity in those who failed to respond to the first dose. What can be the effect of not being immunized against rubella? Rubella infection is serious due to its potential to cause birth defects. Infection in a pregnant woman may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the birth of an infant with abnormalities that may include deafness, cataracts, heart defects, liver and spleen damage, and mental retardation. These abnormalities are defined as \"congenital rubella syndrome\" (CRS) and occur in at least 25 percent of infants born to women who have had rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Questions & Answers 6 What can be done to prevent the spread of rubella? Maintaining high levels of rubella immunization in the community is critical to controlling transmission of the virus when sporadic cases or outbreaks occur. Prevention of rubella is especially important in susceptible pregnant women to prevent the birth defects caused by CRS. Therefore, women of childbearing age who have not been vaccinated should receive one rubella vaccine. Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should not receive rubella vaccine. Although there is no evidence that rubella vaccine causes birth defects, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after rubella or MMR vaccine. Infected children should not attend school when they are infectious; infected children may return to school 7 days after rash onset. Where can I get additional information on rubella?

Surveillance and Reporting - pneumoniae causes many clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection (e.g., acute otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, or meningitis). Pneumococci are increasingly likely to be resistant to one or several antibiotics, including penicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cephalosporins. Invasive disease caused is notifiable with microbial susceptibility information requested. pneumococcus asymptomatically colonizes the nasopharynx of 5-40% of healthy people. Mode of Transmission : By droplet spread, direct oral contact, or through contact with articles freshly soiled with respiratory discharges. Person-to-person transmission of the organism is common, but illness among casual contacts and attendants is infrequent. Disease results when the organism multiplies locally (e.g., otitis media), multiplies after aspiration (pneumonia) or invades a sterile site (e.g., centra l nervous system or bloodstream). Incubation Period: Variable. For pneumococcal pneumonia, approximately 1 to 3 days. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: For invasive disease: Isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid) Case Classification: Probable: a clinically compatible case without laboratory confirmation or with isolation of S. pneumoniae from a non-sterile site. Confirmed: a clinically compatible case with a laboratory confirmed isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. Period of Communicability: Presumably until discharges of mouth and nose no longer contain virulent pneumococci in significant numbers. This can be a prolonged period among immunocompromised persons. Vaccine: The polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) is recommended for all adults over age 65 and any individuals 2 years of age or older with chronic medical conditions that place them at high risk for pneumococcal di sease. PPSV is not effective in children under age 2. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed for use in February 2010 and is recommended for infants and young children up to five years of age. Children who have begun their immunization series with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) should complete the series with PCV13 when available. PPV23, PCV7, and PCV13 provide protection against commonly resistant pneumococcal strains. For more detailed vaccination information, see Pneumococcal Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: Sensitivities of strains isolated from normally sterile sites should be determined because of increasing prevalence of drug-resistant pneumococci. Where diagnostic facilities are limited and delay in treatment could prove fatal, antibiotic treatment should be started presumptively based on clinical signs.

Surveillance and Reporting - Fact Sheet 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) is a bacterium that frequently causes pneumonia (lung infection), otitis media (ear infection), bloodstream infection, and meningitis. Invasive S. pneumoniae infections affect body sites that normally contain no bacteria at all, such as blood, spinal fluid, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid. Who gets pneumococcal infections? Pneumococcal disease is most common at the extremes of age. Infections are also more common and severe in people with weakened immune systems such as persons undergoing chemotherapy or with HIV infection, or people with chronic diseases such as sickle cell disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, or congestive heart failure. Blacks, American Indians and Alaska Natives are also at higher risk. What are the symptoms of a pneumococcal infection? Symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia include abrupt onset of fever, shaking chills, chest pain, productive cough, shortness of breath, and weakness. Signs of pneumococcal meningitis include headache, drowsiness, vomiting, irritability, fever, stiff neck, and seizures. Ear infection can cause fever and ear pain or discharge. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms of infections caused by pneumococcus take a minimum of 1 to 3 days to develop after exposure. When and for how long is a person able to spread S. pneumoniae? A person can spread the organism as long as th e pneumococci are present in the discharges from the nose and mouth. Illness among casual contacts of a person with pneumococcal disease is infrequent. How can pneumococcal disease be prevented? Three pneumococcal vaccines are available. PPV23 protects against infections caused by common strains of S. pneumoniae . It is recommended for everyone age 65 and older, and for people age 2 years and older with underlying health conditions making them more susceptible to S. pneumoniae infections. The other two pneumococcal vaccines, PCV7 and PCV13, prevent disease in infants and young children. PCV13 is newly licensed and is effective against more strains of S. pneumoniae than PCV7. PCV7 and PCV13 are recommended for use in children under 5 years old. What is drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae ? Drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) are the common bacterium S. pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) that have become resistant to a variety of antibiotics. Some strains are resistant to only one antibiotic, while other strains are resistant to many antibiotics, making infection with these strains more difficult to treat. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE FACT SHEET (Invasive Disease, Repor ted Syndrome and Suscep tiblility Information) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Streptococcus Pneumoniae Fact Sheet 4 How common is DRSP? Surveillance studies by the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention have shown that in the U.S., DRSP strains have been increasing in frequency since 1987. In some communities, 40% of S. pneumoniae isolates are resistant to at least one drug, and strains causing infections may be resistant to several antibiotics. DRSP strains in Georgia are more common than in many other parts of the U.S. What caused these strains of bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics? Many experts believe that overuse of antib iotics contributes to the development of DRSP strains. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat infections caused by viruses (such as colds and bronchitis), which are not killed by antibiotics. Once DRSP is in the community, use of antibiotics may \"select\" the resistant strains for survival. Where can I get additional information on pneumococcal disease?

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 1 Tetanus Fact Sheet Agent: The bacterium, Clostridium tetani . Brief Description: Tetanus is an acute, often fatal disease caused by an exotoxin produced by the anaerobic organism C. tetani in a contaminated wound. Increased muscle rigidity and severe muscle spasms characterize tetanus. The muscle stiffness usually first involves the jaw (lockjaw) and neck, and later becomes generalized. Muscle spasms may continue for 3-4 weeks or more. Other symptoms include fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and rapid heart rate. Reservoir: Intestines of humans, as well as the intestines of horses and other animals, in which the organism is a normal inhabitant. Tetanus spores are ubiquitous in the environment and can contaminate wounds of all types. Soil or fo mites contaminated with animal and human feces can also be reservoirs. Mode of Transmission: Tetanus spores are introduced into the body through: (1) puncture wounds; (2) lacerations, burns, trivial or unnotic ed wounds in which fecally-contaminated soil containing C. tetani spores penetrates body tissues; or (3) by injected contaminated street drugs. Incubation Period: Usually 3 to 21 days, although it may range from 1 day to several months, depending on the wound. The average is 8 days, and most cases occur within 14 days. Shorter incubation periods have been associated with more heavily contaminated wounds, more severe disease, and a worse prognosis. Period of Communicability: Not transmitted from person-to-person. Clinical Case Definition: Acute onset of hypertonia and/or painful muscular contractions (usually of the muscles of the jaw and neck) and generalized muscle spasms without other apparent medical cause. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Attempts at laboratory confirmation are of little help. The organism is rarely recovered from the site of infection, and there is usually no detectable antibody response. The diagnosis is entirely clinical and does not depend upon bacteriologic confirmation. Diagnostic Testing: Not indicated. Case Classification: Confirmed: A clinically compatible case, as reported by a health-care professional. Vaccination: Primary tetanus immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all persons at least 6 weeks old, but < 7 years of age, for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. For those with allergies to pertussis vaccine, a diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine is available (DT). The primary vaccination consists of a three-dose series, administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. The fourth dose (first booster) is recommended at 15-18 months of age to maintain adequate immunity during preschool years. The fifth dose (second booster) is recommended for children aged 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early y ears of schooling. Routine tetanus booster immunization, with tetanus toxoid usually combined with adult-diphtheria toxoid (Td), is recommended for all persons > 7 years of age every 10 years. Persons aged 10-64 years may get a one-time dose of Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health TETANUS FACT SHEET (LockJaw) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 2 Tetanus Fact Sheet in lieu of one booster dose of Td. For more detailed vaccination information, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG) IM, in doses of 3,000-6,000 IU. The wound should be properly cleaned, debrided, and excised if necessary. Metronidazole (30 mg/kg per day, given at 6-hour intervals) is the antibiotic of choice and should be given for 7-14 days. Active immunization should be initiated concurrently wi th therapy. Tetanus clinical disease does not confer immunity because of the small amount of toxin required to produce illness. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: For routine wound management, wounds that are \"dirty\" should be treated with TIG IM unless the patient has had three or more doses of the tetanus vaccine. \"Dirty\" wounds include those contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, or saliva, puncture wounds, avulsions, and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, or frostbite. For all wounds, clean or dirty, a dose of Td should be given if the patient has had less than three doses of the vaccine. If patients have had three or more doses, the decision to give Td should be based on the amount of time since the last vaccine was given. If the wound is clean, the patient should receive Td unless he or she has had the vaccine within the last ten years. If the wound is dirty, give Td unless he or she has had the vaccine within the last five years. The wound should be cleaned and debrided as described under \"Treatment.\" Investigation: The Tetanus Surveillance Worksheet may be used as a guideline. The investigation should include identification of age at onset, the circumstances of any previous injury, tetanus toxoid vaccination history, and determination of the patient's status (alive, dead) at one-month after onset of disease.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Fact Sheet VARICELLA FACT (VZV) Brief Description: varicella infection is characterized by a generalized, pruritic, vesicular rash typically consisting of 250 to 500 lesions in varying stages of development and resolution (crusting). In some infected individuals a low-grade fever may precede the rash. Varicella severity and complications ar e increased among immunocompromised persons, children younger than 1 year of age, and adults . Adults and immunocompromised persons are most at risk for developing serious complications. Complications can include bacterial superinfection of skin lesions, pneumonia, encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, Reye syndrome, and death. Breakthrough varicella is a case of wild-type varicella infection that occurs more than 42 days after an individual is vaccinated with varicella vacci ne. This disease is usually mild with a shorter duration of illness, absence of fever, and fewer than 50 skin lesions. The rash may not become vesicular (fluid-filled blister) or itchy. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Airborne, by droplet spread, or by direct contact with secretions from the nose, throat or vesicular lesions of an infected person. Spread may also occur by contact with articles that have been soiled by fluid from lesions. Incubation Period: Commonly 14 to 16 days, range 10 to 21 days Period of Communicability: Persons with varicella are considered infectious from 1 to 2 days before rash onset until all lesions are crusted (usually about 5 days). Varicella is one of the most readily communicable diseases, especially just before and in the early stages of eruption. Breakthrough cases may sometimes be as infectious as natural varicella, particularly if the rash is extensive and contains vesicles. Exposure : In general, exposure to varicella is defined as contact with nasopharyngeal secretions or vesicular lesions, face-to-face interaction, or sharing indoor airspace with an infectious person. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with acute onset of diffuse (generalized) maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause. Note: In vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough varicella more than 42 days after vaccination, the disease is almost always mild with fewer than 50 skin lesions and shorter duration of illness. The rash may also be atypical in appearance (maculopapular with few or no vesicles). Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Fact Sheet VARICELLA FACT SHEET Case Classification: Probable : A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, and is not epidemiologically linked to another probable or confirmed case. Confirmed : A case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed or probable case. Note: Two probable cases that are epidemiologically linked are considered confirmed cases Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV Note: Routine laboratory testing to diagnose varicella in each case is not generally recommended, but testing may be useful in special circumstances to confirm the diagnosis or to determine varicella susceptibility. Diagnostic Testing: P A. Polymerase Chain Reaction a. Specimen needed: crusts (scab), vesicular fluid or cells from the base of a lesion (See Appendix 1 for specimen collection and submission details ) b. Outfit: n/a c. Form: #3409 VZV (rt-PCR) e. Lab Performing Test: State Molecular Biology Laboratory, Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL), in Decatur f. Transport Requirements: The specimen can be submitted dry, preferably in a sterile container. Please notify the Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588 before sending the specimen, as PCR testing is available by request only from the state office. Immunity : Evidence of immunity to varicella includes: 1. Documentation of age-appropriate vaccination 2. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease 3. Born in the United States before 1980 (for healthcare providers and pregnant women, this does not suffice as evidence of immunity) 4. A healthcare provider diagnosis of varicella or verification of history of varicella disease 5. History of herpes zoster based on healthcare provider diagnosis Vaccination: A vaccine for varicella was licensed in 1995. It is recommended that all children without contraindications be vaccinated between 12 and 15 months of age and receive a second dose between 4 and 6 years of age. The second dose may be administered earlier than 4 through 6 years of age if at least 3 months have elapsed following the first dose. However, if the second dose is administered at least 28 days following the first dose, the second dose does Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 3 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Fact Sheet VARICELLA FACT SHEET not need to be repeated. Healthy people over the age of 13 who have no history of chickenpox and have never been vaccinated against the disease should get two doses of the vaccine four to eight weeks apart. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Varicella vaccine is effective in preventing infection or modifying the severity of illness if given within 72 hours and possibly up to 120 hours after varicella exposure. Antiviral drugs are not typically recommended for prophylaxis. Varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is no longer available. An investigational product (VariZIG) can be given under an investigational new drug protocol within 96 hours of exposure to susceptible persons at high risk for developing severe varicella. The patient groups recommended by the ACIP to receive Vari ZIG include immunocompromised persons, pregnant women, and neonates whose mothers have varicella 5 days before to 2 days after delivery, and certain preterm infants. Treatment: Supportive. Note: Acyclovir and similar agents can reduce the duration and severity of illness if given within 24 hours of rash onset. These drugs should be considered for treatment of immunocompromised persons and other persons at high risk for severe varicella. (See 2009 AAP Red Book) Investigation: 1.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Questions & Answers VARICELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS What is varicella (chickenpox)? Varicella (chickenpox) is a contagious, vaccine-preventable disease the varicella zoster virus (VZ). Who gets varicella? Before the vaccine became available, almost everyone got varicella. Anyone who has not had the disease and has not received the varicella vaccine can get varicella. However, no vaccine is 100% effective and some individuals who have been vaccinated can still get varicella, although it is usually much milder. How is varicella spread? Varicella is spread through the respiratory tract. The most common mode of transmission is by person to person from infected respiratory tract secretions. Transmission may also occur by respiratory contact with airborne droplets or by di rect contact or inhalation of aerosols from skin lesions of acute disease. What are the symptoms of varicella? In children, the first sign of varicella is often a rash, though adults may have 1-2 days of fever and fatigue before the rash begins. The rash is itchy, and usually appears first on the head, followed by the trunk and then the limbs. Initially maculopapular, it evolves into fluid-filled vesicles which last 3-4 days before crusting. There may be 2-4 successive crops of lesions. Children often also develop fever and fatigue, which last 2-3 days. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms usually appear in 14 to 16 days, although they may occur as early as 10 or as late as 21 days after exposure. How long is a person with varicella contagious? Varicella is most contagious two days before the rash appears until all blisters are crusted over (typically 5 days). What complications are associated with getting varicella? Varicella is usually mild and self-limited, but it may be associated with complications. Secondary bacterial infections of skin lesions with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus and pneumonia are the most common causes of hospitalization. Complications from varicella are higher in infants, persons older than 15 years of age, unvaccinated pregnant women and in immunocompromised persons such as those wi th HIV infection, leukemia and lymphoma. Does past infection make a person immune? No. The varicella vaccine is 70 to 90% effective in preventing disease and being vaccinated with 2 doses can prevent severe disease in 95% of persons. There is still a small chance of getting the disease even after vaccination, but it is infrequent and usually a much milder illness. Is there treatment for varicella? The treatment for varicella is primarily supportive. Treatment depends on a person's age, health and severity of illness. A primary care physician should be seen to discuss treatment options. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 6 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Questions & Answers VARICELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS Is there a vaccine for varicella? A vaccine for varicella is available. It is recommended that all children be routinely vaccinated between 12 and 18 months of age and receive a second dose between 4 and 6 yrs. of age. Healthy people over the age of 13 who have no history of varicella and have never been vaccinated against the disease should get two doses of the vaccine four to eight weeks apart. Since varicella is usually not serious, why not let people get the disease? It is never possible to predict who will have a m ild case of varicella and who will have a serious or even deadly case of the disease. Now that a safe and effective vaccine is available, it is not worth taking a chance. Where can I get additional information on varicella?

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Specimen Collection and Submission VARICELLA SPECIMEN COLL ECTION AND SUBMISSION APPENDIX 1: VARICELLA SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION Routine laboratory testing to diagnose varicella in each case is not generally recommended, but testing may be useful in special circumstances to confirm t he diagnosis or to determine varicella susceptibility. To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory subm ission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions: Viral Testing : To make a laboratory diagnosis of VZV in fection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, the presence of viral DNA should be demo nstrated in tissues, vesicular fluid or crusts from lesions. We recommend the following methods for th e collection of specimens for PCR testing. As noted below, scabs generally contain sufficient viral DNA for amplification and as such are also useful specimens. Polyester Swab Method Use a sterile needle to unroof the top of the vesicle Use a synthetic, sterile swab to vigorously swab the base of the lesion, applying enough pressure to collect epithelial cells without causing bleeding, and collect vesicular fluid (collection of infected epithelial cells at the base of the le sion is important because they usually contain a significant amount of virus). Place swab into empty tube, breakage -resistant snap-cap, or screw top tube DO NOT PLACE TRANSPORT MEDIUM INTO THE TUBE; THE SPEC IMEN MUST BE KEPT DRY Specimen can remain at room temperature Glass Slide Method Rake the edge of the glass slide over the selected lesion to disrupt it Press the flat surface of the slide against t he opened lesion, rocking it back and forth several times (with young children it may be less stre ssful if you ask them to help with this) Air-dry the specimen Place glass slide in a container that protects against breakage. Cardboard mailers work well Specimen can remain at room temperature Crusts (Scabs) Remove a scab from the patient Place specimen into empty tube, breakage- resistant snap cap, or screw top tube Specimen can remain at room temperature Laboratory Submission Instructions Notify County or District Public Health Office immediately for coordination.

Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 1 RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL PREVENTING INFLUENZA Vaccination remains the primary method of preventing influenza infection or lessening the severity of influenza. Because circulating in fluenza strains change from year to year, a new vaccine is manufactured each year. For complete protection individuals must receive a new influenza vaccine annually. October to November is the ideal time for influenza vaccination, especially for persons at higher risk of developi ng complications from influenza, such as residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) . Persons who did not receive an influenza vaccine during the ideal time should still be immunized throughout the influenza season to achieve some protection. Employees of LTCF are also strongly advised to be vaccinated to reduce the chance of thei r spreading influenza to residents. LTCF visitors should be encouraged to receive influenza vaccine. In fact, given that influenza vaccine is more effective at preventing di sease among young, healthy adults than among the elderly, vaccination of workers and visitors may be more effective in preventing disease among LTCF residents than vaccinati on of the residents themselves. Listed below are the three manufacturers of influenza vaccine with contact information for ordering. The ideal time to order influenza vaccine for the upcoming flu season is in the spring, as most manufacturers' stocks are agents cause flu-like sympt oms, making influenza diagnosis difficult on clinical grounds. A verified diagnosis of in fluenza requires a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which may take up to 4 hours. Several rapid tests for influenza have been developed with variable sensitiv ities and specificities. Some of these rapid tests can provide results as fast as 10 minutes and may be useful in a LTCF setting to attempt to quickly document the cause of an outbreak of influenza-like illness. While negative rapid test results do not rule out influenza virus as the causative agent, a single positive test result in a LTCF setting strongly indicates an outbreak is due to influenza. If rapid tests are being used, PCR tests should still be done for confirmation and to identify the strain and antigenic characte ristics of the virus. Public health officials can provide molecular specimen submission kits to an LTCF during an outbreak and arrange for viral testing at the Georgia Public Health Laborat ory. Call your local health department immediately if an influenza outbreak is suspected in a LTCF. Public health does not supply rapid tests for influenza.

TREATING INFLUENZA Two antiviral drugs are cu rrently approved approved for prophylaxis against influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir ma y be used for influenza A or B. Influenza A virus resistance to amantadine and rimantadi ne can emerge rapidly during treatment. On the basis of antiviral testing results conduct ed at CDC and in Canada indicating high levels of resistance, CDC and ACIP recommend that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoprophy laxis of influenza A in the Un ited States until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been re -established among circ ulating influenza A viruses. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically rela ted antiviral drugs k nown as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infections. Zanamivir, an inhaled drug, may aggravate existing chronic respiratory illnesses. Table 2 describes medication dosage and duration fo r all age groups with normal renal function2. Each medication should be administer ed within 48 hours of symptom onset. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Resources 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 4 INFLUENZA PROPHYLAXIS In 2000, oseltamivir was approved for chemopr ophylaxis of influenza among persons aged >13 years and was approved for chemoprophylaxis of children aged >1 year in 2005. In 2006, zanamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxi s of children aged >5 years. Once a cluster of influenza-like illness has been identified in a long-term care facility, chemoprophylaxis of all resident s should begin immediately, regardless of whether they received vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis of staff should also be considered. Table 2 describes dosage and duration for pe rsons 65 years and older with normal renal function 2. Table 2.

Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 5 Abbreviation: NA = not approved * Zanamivir is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (Relenza --- inhaled powder). Zanamivir is approved for treatment of persons aged 7 years and approved for chemoprophylaxis of persons aged 5 years. Zanamivir is administered through oral inhalation by using a plastic device included in the medication package. Patients will benefit from instruction and demonstration of the correct use of the device. Zanamivir is not recommended for those persons with underlying airway disease. Oseltamivir is manufactured by Roche Pharmaceuticals (Tamiflu --- tablet). Oseltamivir is approved for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of persons aged 1 year. Oseltamivir is available for oral administration in 30 mg, 45 mg, and 75 mg capsules and liquid suspension. No antiviral medications are approved for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza among children aged <1 year. This information is based on data published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days. Longer treatment courses can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment. \u00a7 Recommended duration is 10 days when administered after a household exposure and 7 days after the most recent known exposure in other situations. For control of outbreaks in long-term care facilities and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis for a minimum of 2 weeks and up to 1 week after the most recent known case was identified \u00b6 See Table 4 for information about use of oseltamivir for infants aged <1 year. A reduction in the dose of oseltamivir is recommended for persons with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. ** The treatment dosing recommendation for oseltamivir for children aged 1 year who weigh 15 kg is 30 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >15 kg and up to 23 kg, the dose is 45 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >23 kg and up to 40 kg, the dose is 60 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >40 kg, the dose is 75 mg twice a day. The chemoprophylaxis dosing recommendation for oseltamivir for children aged 1 year who weigh 15 kg is 30 mg once a day. For children who weigh >15 kg and up to 23 kg, the dose is 45 mg once a day. For children who weigh >23 kg and up to 40 kg, the dose is 60 mg once a day. For children who weigh >40 kg, the dose is 75 mg once a day. REIMBURSEMENT FOR INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are a Medicare benefit, so long-term care facilities can bill Medicare for these immunizations. Frequently, nursing homes in Georgia are not billing Medicare and are losing this revenue. One of the most effectiv e strategies for increasing influenza and pneumococcal immunizations involves the health care provi der. Medicare beneficiaries are more likely to get immunized when their physician specifically recommends vaccination. Medicare Part B began paying for influenza vaccine on May 1, 1993. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Resources 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 6 Medicare Part B began paying for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) on July 1, 1981. Coverage of the vaccines and their administrat ion is available under Medicare Part B regardless of the setting in which they are administered. If a beneficiary at high risk of pneumococcal disease (i.e., aged 65 or older) is unsure about his or her PPV vaccination status, Medicare will cover re-vaccination. Roster bills can be submitted so that only one bill is needed per facility (although influenza and pneumococcal vaccines must be on s eparate roster claim forms).

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 1 Influenza vaccination remains the primary method of preventing illness and death associated with influenza. Among elderly persons residing in nursing homes, influenza vaccine can be 50-60% effective in preventing hospitalization or pneumonia and 80% effective in preventing death. However, the vaccine may be less effective in preventing milder illness. If an outbreak of influenza-like illness (defined as fever > 100 F oral (> 101 F rectal) AND cough and/or sore throat) occurs in a long-term care facility, please immediately contact the local county health department or the Georgia Department of Public Health Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588 for assistance in outbreak investigation and control. Public health can help you confirm the diagnosis and prevent spread. A. Confirmation of Influenza and Determination of the Outbreak Strain Early in the outbreak, obtain viral throat swab specimens from up to 10 patients with symptoms suggestive of influenza for viral culture and antigen detection. Viral specimen kits can be obtained through the health department, which can also arrange testing at the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Because viral culture results may not be available for up to 10 days, facilities may also consider using rapid flu tests. While a negative rapid test result does not rule out influenza, a single positive result strongly indicates that influenza is causing the outbreak. Please see RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for more information about rapid flu tests. Rapid flu tests are not available through public health. B. Vaccination of Patients and Personnel Even during an outbreak, administer current influenza vaccine to unvaccinated patients and staff, especially if the outbreak occurs early in the influenza season. The local county health department may have vaccine available during flu season. See RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for information on how to order influenza vaccine prior to flu season. For more detailed vaccination information, see Influenza Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. C. Treatment and Prophylaxis Certain rapid tests are able to differentiate between influenza A and B which can help guide which antiviral medication can be used. Even in the absence of viral strain confirmation, the Georgia Department of Public Health advises long-term care facilities to begin treatment and prophylaxis of residents and staff with antiviral medications. If influenza is suspected, treatment and prophylaxis should not be delayed until viral culture results are available. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Outbreak Control In A Long-Term Care Facility 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 2 Two antiviral drugs are currently approved for influenza treatment: oseltamivir and zanamivir. Oseltamivir and zanamivir have also been approved for prophylaxis against influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir may be used for influenza A or B. Influenza A virus resistance to amantadine and rimantadine can emerge rapidly during treatment. On the basis of antiviral testing results conducted at CDC and in Canada indicating high levels of resistance, CDC and ACIP recommend that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in the United States until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses . Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related antiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infections. In 2000, oseltamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxis of in fluenza among persons aged >13 years and was approved for chemoprophylaxis of children aged >1 year in 2005. In 2006, zanamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxis of children aged >5 years. Please see RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for information regarding medication dosage and therapy duration. D. Interruption of Person-to-Person Transmission Keep residents known or suspected to have influenza in a private room or in a room with other residents with documented influenza unless there are medical contraindications. If feasible, place persons with influenza-like illness together in an area with an independent air supply and exhaust system. Implement respiratory droplet precautions, including requiring all staff that have contact with ill residents to wear masks and gloves, and to wash hands frequently and thoroughly. Consider using hand sanitizers in areas where hand washing is difficult. Restrict visitors who have a febrile respiratory illness. Do not allow staff to work while ill. Consider temporarily closing the facility to new admissions while the outbreak continues. Preventing Influenza Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Facilities Morbidity and mortality from influenza can be greatly reduced if long-term care facilities follow these guidelines for influenza prevention: Develop an influenza control plan incorporating vaccination, surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis activities. Ensure all staff are familiar with the plan's components. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Outbreak Control In A Long-Term Care Facility 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 3 Plan an annual vaccination campaign targeting all residents, staff, volunteers, and visitors for flu vaccination. Ideally, vaccination should occur in October or early November, but the facility should also have methods in place to ensure that all staff and residents who enter the facility after the mass vaccination campaign are also vaccinated. Standing orders by the facility medical director may make this process more convenient. Review residents' immunization histories and administer pneumococcal vaccine to those who are eligible. This should be done on a regular basis, and especially during the annual flu vaccine campaign. If a pneumococcal vaccination history is unknown, it is safe and preferable to give another dose. During flu season, post signs asking visitors with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, or muscle aches, to refrain from visiting. Train staff at the beginning of each flu season on the proper respiratory secretion precautions, hand-washing procedures, and surveillance activities. Have a mechanism to ensure all new employees who are hired during flu season receive the training as well. Establish and post a definition of flu-like illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines flu-like illness as fever > 100F oral or > 101F rectal and at least one of the following: cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, or sore throat. Be aware that influenza symptoms are sometimes different in elderly persons or persons with chronic medical conditions. Staff should be alert for residents who have fever with lethargy or delirium, or changes in their functional status. Monitor influenza activity in the communi ty. The Georgia Department of Public Health posts influenza information at http://health.state.ga.us/epi/flu . You may also receive periodic influenza activities during flu season by subscribing to the public health flu email list (sign up by sending an email to flu@dhr.state.ga.us with the word \"subscribe\" in the subject line). Knowledge of influenza activity in the community can assist in making a clinical diagnosis. Consider stocking rapid flu tests and antiviral medications for immediate detection and response to outbreaks. If you do not stock rapid tests, have a plan in place for quickly obtaining laboratory confirmation of influenza. There should also be a method to quickly obtain physician orders for antiviral medication. Post the county, district, or state health department phone number for reporting a cluster of influenza-like illness. A cluster is defined as 3 or more cases of illness among residents and/or staff within a 72-hour period. By law, any cluster of illness must be reported to Georgia public health authorities immediately .

Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 2 A. Background In the United States, over 24,000 pregnant women test positive for hepatitis B virus (HVB) each year. In Georgia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates between 516-849 births to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive women should be reported annually. Aside from antiviral treatment, there is currently no cure for hepatitis B infection; however, there are methods to prevent perinatal exposure. Administering the hepatitis B vaccine to the infant within 12 hours of birth has shown to be 85-95 percent effective in preventing acute and chronic HBV infection in infants born to women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg. The purpose of Georgia's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program is to ensure that babies born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive women are given the opportunity to live their lives free of hepatitis B disease. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women are exposed to the virus through contact with their mother's blood during delivery. Infants and children who become infected with the hepatitis B virus have a 90 percent chance of becoming chronic carriers. These children are more likely to die prematurely from end-stage liver disease (hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis) as adults. Immunizing babies born to HBsAg-positive women with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine series can prevent this tragic outcome. Identification of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in pregnant women occurs through prenatal screening and reporting of positive HBsAg results from the laboratory and/or physician to the state or local health department. To prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B, health district case managers and staff follow HBsAg-positive pregnant women during gestation and track their infants through completion of the post-vaccination serologic testing. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women should be administered HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine at birth, followed by hepatitis B vaccine at 1-2 months and 6 months of age. Vaccination of sexual and household contacts of HBsAg-positive pregnant women also prevents transmission to susceptible individuals who are at high risk for the disease. Infected women should be in formed by the provider that antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B does exist and encouraged to follow up with a provider after delivery. The Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program is funded through the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Immunization Services Division, with technical support from CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Since 1991, every state has received federal funding to support the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program. Separate funding from the state has been allocated to each district to assist with case management. These guidelines are to be used as a reference for the case management of HBsAg- positive pregnant women, their infants, and sexual/household contacts. Emphasis is placed upon infant prophylaxis and post-vaccination testing. The appendix contains several forms and tools that can be used during the case management process. Please adapt these materials to suit the needs of your Health District's perinatal hepatitis B prevention program. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 3 B. Program Goals The goals of the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program are to: Ensure that all pregnant women are screened for HBsAg as part of the initial prenatal screening panel. Assure that all local health departments perform case investigations on all positive HBsAg-pregnant women reported to their jurisdiction. Confirm that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive HBIG and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within twelve (12) hours of birth. Ensure that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive the second dose of vaccine at 1-2 months of age, and the third dose of vaccine at six (6) months of age. Ensure that infants born to HBsAg-positive women in the U.S. and residing in Georgia are tested at nine (9) months to eighteen (18) months of age for HBsAg and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) after completing the hepatitis B vaccination series. C. Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Program Eligibility Requirements Eligibility requirements for enrollment into Georgia's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program include: All pregnant women who test positive for HBsAg All infants born to HBsAg-positive women All sexual and household contacts of HBsAg-positive pregnant women D. Universal Prenatal Screening for Hepatitis B The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), and The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all pregnant women be routinely tested for HBsAg at an early prenatal visit in each pregnancy. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program encourages all prenatal health providers to follow this recommendation. An additional test for HBsAg can be ordered later in the pregnancy (approximately 34 weeks gestation) if the mother is at high risk for acquiring HBV infection (e.g., more than one sex partner during the past six (6) months, recent history of STD, intravenous drug use, household contact of a chronically HBV infected person). Pregnant women susceptible to hepatitis B virus (i.e., have never been infected) can and should be vaccinated against the disease during pregnancy , especially if they are at high risk for infection (see CDC \"Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women\" at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/preg_guide.htm). Chapter 2 in this manual also addresses the hepatitis B vaccine schedule and age appropriate dosage information. Appendix H-1, \"Hepatitis B Facts: Testing and Vaccination,\" will provide a concise interpretation of the hepatitis B serology profile. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 4 E. General Management of HBsAg-Positive Pregnant Women The following guidelines are recommended by the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program and follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the ACIP for managing an HBsAg-positive pregnant woman. 1. The client's physician should draw a prenatal serologic panel at the time pregnancy is confirmed. While there is no law in Georgia mandating prenatal HBsAg testing, it is considered a standard of care for prenatal screening panels to include HBsAg serology. One of the following two scenarios may occur after the laboratory performs the test: a. If the HBsAg test is NEGATIVE, the laboratory will report the results to the physician. The physician files the results in the client's records and sends the information with the rest of her prenatal records to the hospital before delivery. b. If the HBsAg test is POSITIVE , the laboratory reports the results to the physician AND the Epidemiology Section at the State Health Department. The physician should inform the pregnant woman of her HBsAg-positive status, file the results in the client's record, and send the information with the rest of her prenatal records to the hospital prior to delivery. 2. The Epidemiology Section sends HBsAg-positive laboratory reports on all females between age 10 and 50 years to the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program. 3. The Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program reviews the laboratory reports for females ages 10 to 50 years that are positive for HBsAg. The program then contacts the physician and inquires of pregnancy status, estimated date of confinement (EDC), and delivery hospital of each reported case. 4. All pregnant HBsAg-positive women are then entered in the Web-based tracking system (Perinatal SENDSS) wher e it is available to the district perinatal hepatitis B case manager for case management. 5. All PREGNANT clients are contacted by the Health District for counseling about their infection and interviewed for sexual and household contacts. The message is then reinforced that the client must also alert medical personnel attending her baby's birth that she is positive for HBsAg. NOTE: All HBsAg-positive test results for pregnant women must be reported to either the Local Health Department or the state Department of Public Health Epidemiology Section by the laboratory and health care provider within seven (7) days of receiving positive results. Reporting is required by authority of the Official Code of Georgia Section 31-12-2, Official Code of Georgia Section 31-22-7, Rules of the Department of Human Resources, chapter 290-5-3-02. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 5 NOTE : Communicating the woman's HBsAg status to the birthing hospital's department of labor and delivery should be the responsibility of her healthcare provider . It is strongly recommended that the Health District make efforts to remind the healthcare provider and the hospital of the woman's impending delivery at least four weeks before her EDC. An alert letter should be sent to the hospital's labor & delivery unit and/or provider. See Appendix B-2 for a sample fax to use when notifying the hospital for this purpose. 6. The hepatitis B counseling interview should be performed in the client's own language. Each district has a Limited English Proficient/Sensory Impaired (LEP/SI) Program Coordinator. This coordinator can assist the district with the utilization of the language line. It is critical that she is aware of self-care and disease transmission in order to protect her own health and that of others. See the Example Interviewing/Counseling Format for assistance (Appendix D-1). 7. Any client who is chronically infected with hepatitis B should be encouraged to seek care with her physician so that her condition can be monitored routinely. Advise the client to discuss possible treatment options with her physician that may improve her health outcome and overall quality of life. F. General Management of Infants Born to HBsAg-Positive Women 1. Babies born to women who are HBsAg positive must receive HBIG and the appropriate dose of hepatitis B vaccine (see Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") within twelve (12) hours of birth. NOTE : There is a window of seven (7) days to administer HBIG if an infant born to an HBsAg-positive woman did not receive HBIG within twelve (12) hours of delivery. Every effort should be made to locate the infant and administer HBIG within seven (7) days, if the baby was released from the hospital before receiving this important prophylactic component. 2. The Health District should contact either the client or the delivery hospital close to the date of delivery to learn: a. Infant's name, birth date and sex, and b. If the infant received HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within twelve (12) hours of birth. After obtaining this information, the Health District should update the Perinatal SENDSS case management event screen, where it will be available to the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program. 3. The Health District will notify the pediatric care provider and/or mother that the baby should receive the second dose of vaccine, consult GRITS for verification that the vaccine was administered, and update Perinatal SENDSS. 4. The Health District will notify the mother to take the baby for the third dose of vaccine, verify that vaccine was given, and update Perinatal SENDSS for further tracking. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 6 5. District perinatal hepatitis B case managers will document updated infant information in Perinatal SENDSS for each subsequent dose of vaccine and monitor for when any dose of hepatitis B vaccine is overdue. 6. The hepatitis B post-vaccination serologic testing (PVT) should be obtained when the child is 9-18 months old. If the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given late, the child must have received the third dose a minimum of one month before obtaining the PVT. When the test results (HBsAg and anti-HBs) are known, the Health District will update Perinatal SENDSS and document the case as complete. Note : The health district has the discretion to send the parent/guardian and baby to a local public health clinic for the (HBsAg and anti-HBs) PVT, if testing is not otherwise affordable to the family. The local health department, Health District or private physician can send the blood sample to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory where specimen processing will be performed at no charge to the baby's parents/guardians. 7. If the test is NEGATIVE for HBsAg and POSITIVE for anti-HBs , the baby is considered IMMUNE to hepatitis B and the perinatal case is closed. 8. If the test is NEGATIVE for BOTH HBsAg and Anti-HBS, the baby is considered SUSCEPTIBLE to hepatitis B infection, and should be immunized again with the complete 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine . The baby should be retested one (1) month after the sixth dose of hepatitis B vaccine. In the rare instance the child tests negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs after completion of the second series, no additional hepatitis B vaccine is to be given. The mother should be counseled regarding her child's negative results and susceptible status. The perinatal hepatitis B case is closed for the infant after the initial PVT is completed. 9. If the test is POSITIVE for HBsAg and NEGATIVE for anti-HBs , the baby is INFECTED and should be referred to the pediatrician for subsequent follow-up and specialist referrals . This infection is a notifiable disease that should be reported as a perinatal hepatitis B infection through SENDSS and will be reported to the CDC by the Epidemiology Section. The perinatal hepatitis B case is then considered closed. G. Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HBsAg Status 1. Infants born to women whose HBsAg status is unknown at the time of delivery should receive hepatitis B vaccine at the appropriate dosage per manufacturer (see Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") within twelve (12) hours of delivery. The woman should be tested in the hospital at the time of delivery and an expedited HBsAg test should be run to determine her status. If the mother's test is positive, the baby should receive HBIG as soon as possible, preferably before hospital discharge. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 7 REMINDER: There is a window of seven (7) days to administer HBIG if an infant born to an HBsAg-positive woman did not receive HBIG within twelve (12) hours of delivery. Every effort should be made to locate the infant and administer HBIG within this seven (7) days if the baby was released from the hospital without it. 2. The hospital laboratory and physician are required by law (see Note under Section E, 1-b) to report the positive HBsAg test within seven (7) days to the Georgia Department of Public Health, Epidemiology Section. 3. Upon receipt of a maternal HBsAg-positive serology report from the hospital, the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (state Coordinator or Health District) will obtain the baby's vaccination history and enter the infant into the Perinatal SENDSS tracking system to be followed as indicated in Section F, \"General Management of Infants Born to HBsAg-positive Women.\" If the mother is determined to be HBsAg negative, the baby should receive the hepatitis B vaccine according to the schedule recommended by the ACIP for infants born to HBsAg-negative women, that is, first dose at birth, second dose at 1 to 2 months and third dose at 6 to18 months of age. NOTE: When the mother is HBsAg-negative but is at high risk for hepatitis B infection, she should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Hepatitis B vaccine is not contraindicated during pregnancy. 4. Upon completion of the three-dose vaccination series, infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers need to undergo post-vaccination serologic testing (PVT), in order to document immunity or infection status. If the baby does not have insurance to cover the PVT expense or the pediatric provider refuses to do the PVT, the district case manager should assist with arrangements to refer the baby to a nearby public health clinic for the blood test. (See Appendix K-2 for GPHL sample submission form.) H. Management of Sexual/Household Contacts of HBsAg-Positive Pregnant Women 1. When Health Districts receive Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program referrals of HBsAg-positive pregnant women, appropriate District personnel should make every effort to interview these women for household and sexual contacts. The contact interview should take place during the initial counseling session with the woman. It is imperative to identify younger contacts of the HBsAg-positive client due to the high risk for chronic infection in children aged five (5) years and younger. (See Section III, \"Example Interviewing/Counseling Format\", Appendix D-1, for further information.) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 8 2. Household and sexual contacts to HBsAg-positive women are at increased risk of infection; therefore, it is important to test contacts for HBsAg and anti-HBs (See Appendix H-1, \"Hepatitis B Facts: Testing and Vaccination\"). Order these tests at the same visit when the contact receives the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine, but draw the blood for serology before administering vaccine . The test can be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory using Form 3432: http://health.state.ga.us/pdfs/lab/manual/2012/lsm2012.pdf NOTE : Post-vaccination testing is NOT recommended for sexual or household contacts of HBsAg-positive pregnant women. 3. Sexual and household contacts should be vaccinated during their first visit to a medical provider with the age-appropriate dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Vaccine must be given according to the ACIP recommended schedule. See Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\" of this manual for information on the hepatitis B vaccine dosage and scheduling for infants, children and adults. 4. HBIG can be given to sexual contacts of pregnant women diagnosed with acute hepatitis B infection (e.g., HBV infection of less than six (6) months duration with or without symptoms of hepatitis and/or positive anti-HBc IgM), when the last sexual exposure occurred within fourteen (14) days of administration. Administer HBIG and vaccine during the same visit, in two different body sites. HBIG can also be given to those household contacts that have not had sexual exposure, but have had known blood exposure to an acute case of hepatitis B within the past seven (7) days. 5. To calculate HBIG dosage for persons one (1) year of age through adulthood, use 0.06 mL per kilogram of body weight or 0.06 mL per 2.2 pounds of body weight. For example, for an adult weighing 140 pounds, the weight would be divided by 2.2 to obtain the equivalent in kilograms, then multiplied by 0.06 to obtain the HBIG dosage. Example: 140 lbs. \u00f7 2.2 = 63.636 kg, rounded up to 64 kg 64 kg x 0.06 mL = 3.84 mL of HBIG 6. If it is determined that the contact is infected (HBsAg positive) or has immunity (HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive) to infection, no further doses of vaccine are to be given . If the contact is susceptible to infection, that is, HBsAg and anti- HBs negative, then complete the vaccine series. (See Appendix H-4 for hepatitis B serology interpretations.) 7. Each susceptible contact must be followed and reminded to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series at the appropriate intervals (See Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\"). The Health District is responsible for tracking perinatal hepatitis B sexual and household contacts, documenting tests and vaccinations in Perinatal SENDSS, and reporting the information to the Grant-in-Aid monthly report. 8. Contacts that are infected with hepatitis B should be counseled about the disease and its transmission. The \"Example Interviewing/Counseling Format\" is a useful guide for this situation. (See Appendix D-1) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 9 I. Finding Clients That are Lost to Follow Up Ask if provider received request to transfer records to another provider (there may be a fax number available for the new provider). Call telephone information 411 to see if you can locate the lost contact. Use Internet search engines (e.g. Google), white pages, and United States Postal Service online (USPS.com) to search for contact information. Try old telephone numbers. Relatives/friends with information on the patient might still be reached at those numbers. Look in directories that list occupants of each household in the city. Most sexually transmitted disease (STD) programs have such directories. Transpose digits in telephone numbers and addresses. Try \"Street\" instead of \"Avenue\" and vise versa. Ask neighbors, landlords, and apartment rental offices. Ask mail carriers; they cannot give you addresses, by law, but might confirm whether or not the patient lives at the address. Ask the post office for the forwarding address. You may have to complete a justification form provided by the postal service and show your health department identification. The STD case manager may have local procedures. Search health department records. Ask other state and local agencies and programs (e.g. Medicaid, WIC programs, Department of Family and Child Services, parole and probation offices) for contact information. J. Required Reports and Case Updates for Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention in Georgia Each month, the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program will review case information about any cases that are due for activity during that month, such as vaccination, blood tests, deliveries, etc. Health District case management staff are expected to update Perinatal SENDSS at least monthly and alert the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program to any questionable or concerning information about a case. Prompt documentation of case information in Perinatal SENDSS allows for efficient maintenance of the tracking system and thus timely disease prevention. The updates will be used to complete state and federal annual reports including the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Report requested biannually by the CDC. If timely case management is not being performed over a period of several months, a letter of concern may be sent to the District Clinical Coordinator and District Health Director for assistance with problem solving future Perinatal Hepatitis B case management within that district.

Glossary of Terms EDC Estimated date of confinement or the approximate day that a woman's baby is expected to be born (aka: due date). Viral Hepatitis Inflammation of the liver as a result of viral infection. HBV Hepatitis B virus, the agent that causes hepatitis B virus infection . HBsAg Hepatitis B surface antigen found on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. HBsAg is detected in serum thirty (30) to sixty (60) days after HBV exposure and persists for variable periods . HBeAg Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen is associated with active HBV replication, high concentrations of HBV in serum, and high infectivity (increased risk of transmission); appears in early infection and persists for variable length of time (from weeks to years). Anti-HBs Antibody to HBsAg is associated with long-term protection against reinfection and, in most persons, persists for many years after natural infection. Anti-HBs is also produced as an immune response to hepatitis B vaccine or is passively transferred when HBIG is administered. Anti-HBs is curr ently assay Antibody to HBcAg is produced in all HBV infections; it indicates infection at some undefined time and persists indefinitely; sometimes appears as a false-positive result when other HBV tests are negative IgM Anti-HBc IgM class antibody to HBcAg indicates recent infection with HBV and is positive for approximately six (6) months after infection. HBsAg Chronic Carriage Through serologic testing, a person is confirmed as an HBsAg carrier (chronic infection) when: 1) HBsAg is detected on at least two tests, spaced a minimum of six (6) months apart; or 2) the results of a single serum specimen are HBsAg positive and IgM anti-HBc negative. Carriers may be asymptomatic and unaware that they are infected with HBV. Because they carry HBsAg in their blood, they are capable of infecting others. HBIG Hepatitis B immune globulin is a preparation obtained from the blood plasma from donor pools selected for a high antibody content of anti-HBs. In some situations, HBIG is administered post-exposure with hepatitis B vaccine to provide additional protection against HBV infection.

Hepatitis B can be a serious disease. Not only does th is virus affect your liver, but also it can be passed to your baby at the time of birth. To be pr otected from this disease, your baby will need to get several shots. The first two (2) shots are given within a few hours after birth. They are hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and dose 1 of hepatitis B vaccine. Your baby will later need dose 2 of hepatitis B vaccine at one or two months of age and dose 3 at six months of age. After completing these shots, your baby's doctor will do some blood tests to s ee if your baby is protected. The blood test should be done when the baby is between 9 and 18 months of age. In some cases, the baby may need more shots to prevent infection. It is possible that your sexual partner and other peopl e living in your household could get infected. We recommend that they be tested and vaccinated for hepatitis B also, if they haven't been already. It is important that you discuss with your doctor whether you need further follow up for your infection. Your doctor may refer you to a gastroenterologist (GI doctor) who specializes in liver diseases. We encourage you to show this letter to your doctor and later to your baby's doctor.

The Jade Ribbon is folded like the Chinese character for people \" \" to symbolize the united voices of those /f_ighting hepatitis B and liver cancer worldwide. Protect yourself and your baby with the rst \"anti-cancer vaccine\" If you have not been infected, get vaccinated Hepatitis B can still be transmitted through unprotected sex and contaminated blood (sharing toothbrushes, razors, or needles for tattoos/piercings). The 3 shots given over 6 months are safe, even during pregnancy. The hepatitis B vaccine is so eective in preventing HBV and liver cancer that it is known as the /f_irst \"anti-cancer vaccine. \" Make sure your baby is vaccinated at birth Since 1991, U.S. national guidelines have recommended that all newborns be vaccinated against HBV. The 3 shots can protect your baby for life against hepatitis B, reducing the risk of liver cancer and liver damage in the future. Time Infant should receive At birth birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine 1-2 months 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 6 months 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine The vaccine is safe, even for premature babies. ) +,HBV and Moms-to-Be Hepatitis B (HBV) is the most common serious viral infection of the liver, and can lead to premature death from liver cancer or liver failure. In the U.S., approximately 10-15 people die every day as a result of HBV infection. Hepatitis B can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during the birthing process. Newborns who become infected with HBV have a 90% chance of developing chronic (lifelong) infection. Fortunately, HBV can be prevented with a very safe and effective vaccine. Ask your doctor for the results of your HBV test Most people with chronic HBV infection have no symptoms. As an expecting mother, you should have already been tested for HBV with the following blood test: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Tells if you have chronic hepatitis B (also known as being a hepatitis B carrier).7 7 7 7 7 ET ake extra precautions if you are a mom with HBV During pregnancy: Currently, antiviral HBV treatments are not recommended during pregnancy. If you are already on treatment, talk to your doctor. At time of birth: In addition to the /f_irst shot of the hepatitis B vaccine, make sure your newborn receives the hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) shot. Time Infant born to mother with HBV should receive At birth birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) 1-2 months 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 6 months 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 9-18 months HBsAg and anti-HBs* tests to con/f_irm that your child is protected * The hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) blood test checks for protection against HBV. Cesarean sections (C-sections) have not been found to prevent HBV transmission from mother to child. Hepatitis B vaccination along with the HBIG shot is the best way to protect your newborn against HBV infection. In the rst 6 months: It is critical for your child to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series on time. This will be more than 95% effective in protecting your newborn against HBV infection. Breastfeeding is safe for your baby. HBV is not transmitted through breast milk.Moms with HBV You're important too! Remember to get screened for liver disease You probably have no symptoms and feel healthy, but are still at increased risk for liver damage or liver cancer. However, regular screening and appropriate treatment can reduce this risk and help you lead a normal, healthy life. Ask your doctor for the following tests: Every Test Screens for 6 months ALT blood test liver damage AFP blood test liver cancer 1 year ultrasound liver cancer Don't rush into treatment Not every person with chronic HBV infection needs treatment. But if your ALT level is elevated, treatment with antiviral medication may be appropriate. Be sure to review all medications with your doctor. Even some over-the-counter or herbal medications can injure your liver. Get the hepatitis A vaccine Avoid drinking alcohol Protect your loved ones Make sure your family and partner are tested for HBV, and vaccinated if they are not already protected.

Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 1Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Example Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B I. Introduction, professional role, and purpose Purpose: To let the patient know what is going to take place is to his/her benefit, that he /she is going to be dealing with a competent person, and that there should be no fears about discussing otherwise personal information. A. Introduce yourself and anyone else present to the patient. B. Tell the patient that you have been trained and have experience in helping people who have hepatitis B to understand and manage their disease. C. Inform the patient that part of your job is to ensure that no one else find out about the patient's infection and that problems are minimized for everyone who may be involved. II. Patient Assessment Purpose: To establish rapport, get the patient accustomed to talking, reduce the possibility of patient concerns interfering with the rest of the process, gather information that can be used in later sections, and give the patient sufficient information to be able to understand and support disease intervention behaviors. Targeted medical information can preempt inappropriate strategies that the patient may be developing to take care of the problem. By getting the patient to talk during this section, issues may arise that can be used as motivations or as benchmarks against inconsistencies later on in the interview/counseling session. A. Patient Concerns 1. Ask the patient about problems or questions regarding the disease and how it has been handled thus far. 2. Address concerns even if they are in volved in other elements of the format. B. Socio-sexual Information 1. Question patient conversationally about where he/she lives, telephone number, alternate locating information, who living with, empl oyment, travel, recreation social groups. 2. Question the patient about current employment and/or past jobs where they may have had to handle blood or other body fluids. 3. Explain reasons for questions if patient shows signs of concern. C. Medical History and Disease Comprehension 1. Ask what patient knows about the disease. 2. Compliment correct responses, tactfully correct any misconceptions, and add any information that directly suppor ts disease intervention behaviors. 3. Ask about past hepatitis/liver problems. 4. Impress upon the patient that the disease is serious, people usually don't know that they have it until it is too late, that routine tests may not discover the disease, and that it is often passed unintentionally. Appendix D-1 Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 2Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Appendix D-1 III. Disease Intervention Behaviors A. Assure examination of household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts 1. Explain that the medical facts just discussed clearly show that the patient's household contacts, sexual contacts, and needle-sharing co ntacts are in need of an exam as soon as possible. 2. Ask for the names and birthdays of all the children in the home. 3. Explain that other adults in the household need to be notified that they have been exposed to someone with a serious disease. This has to be done so that they can be tested for the infection and given vaccine as necessary. 4. Ask for the names and birthdays of all the adults in the house besides the husband/boyfriend. 5. Explain that the sex partners and needle-sharing partners (sex/NS partners) need to be notified privately that they have been exposed to someone with a serious disease. This has to be done in a way that doesn't embarrass them or the patient, but ensures that the examination takes place immediately by someone who knows enough about the circumstances to do the right things medically. 6. Tell the patient that you can work together to come up with the plan for notifying the sex/NS partners, and that you have to know about each of the sex/NS partners since a certain date in order to do that. 7. If the patient seems hesitant about talking about sex/NS partners, problem solve and explain the different plans and give different examples of how you would handle referrals. 8. Ask for the names of each of the sex/NS partners since the significant date you have established for the interview period. Do not be concerned if the patient doesn't supply the whole name, but emphasize that you want to discuss every partner during that period, regardless of how much they know about them. Continue to probe for partners even after the patient has indicated there are no more. Use some other identifier for sex/NS partners if the patient can't remember a name or nickname. 9. When further probing fails to produce other sex/NS partners, ask and record the last date of exposure beside each person's name. 10. Confront problems indicated by exposure gaps and conflicts with previously gathered information. 11. If you have not already done so, explain referral methods. 12. Gather locating information including full name, nicknames, address, telephone numbers, living-with status, employment, age, race, se x, marital status, physical descriptions, directions to home, description of home, etc. 13. Determine methods of sex/NS partner referral for each partner and agree to best approaches. 14. Coach patient on any contact referrals (referrals they prefer to make, themselves) and give guidelines and deadlines. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 3Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Appendix D-1 B. Reduce Risk Purpose: This section is important for all patients to hear, but is especially important for those who appear to have contracted the infection sexually. The information should be tailored to each patient. 1. The patient should be instructed that it is possible for her to spread the hepatitis B virus to others. She should be told of ways to prevent this spread: a. Household articles that could become contaminated with blood (such as toothbrushes and razors) should not be shared. b. Cuts or skin lesions should be covered to prevent the spread of infectious secretions or blood. c. When seeking medical or dental care, those responsible for care should be informed of HbsAg status. d. If sexual partner(s) are not immune to hepatitis B, the partner should be advised to take precautions, including \"safer sex\" and vaccination, if warranted. e. \"Safer sex\" should be practiced for the prev ention of many sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia infection, and HIV/AIDS. f. Blood, plasma, body organs, other tissue or sperm should not be donated. g. Enroll or stay in a drug treatment program if using illicit drugs. 2. Medical follow-up is needed for evaluation of chronic hepatitis B. Patients with progressive liver disease may need to be referred to a liver spec ialist for consideration of interferon therapy. 3. Other recommendations include: a. Limiting the number of sex partners. b. Limiting anonymous sex. c. Routine checkups for STDs and liver function. C. Respond to Disease Suspicion Purpose: In spite of current status, the patient should understand how to respond to signs that the infection has worsened. 1. Discuss clinical symptoms of hepatitis B. 2. Tell patient to return to provider immediately if symptoms appear. D. Complete Vaccine Series for All Exposed Purpose: The understanding of the multi-dose regimen is particularly important and these messages should be delivered in concert with individualized pamphlets. The case manager should be reinforcing messages expressed by t he provider and verifying that the patient understands and intends to comply with the plan. 1. Emphasize the need for all exposed to complete the series, especially the baby and children of the household. Remind the patient that she is directly responsible for her baby's and other children's health. She should remind the nurses and her baby's doctor that she is a carrier of hepatitis B virus and her baby needs to complete the high- risk vaccine series. 2. Establish a specific schedule so that the patient is aware when the vaccine is due to be given to her baby. 3. Discuss contraindications and potential side effects. 4. Identify and discuss potential compliance problems. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7.

During 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in children which includes the recommendation to administer hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have all endorsed the birth dose recommendation. To obtain a copy, go to www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5416.pdf. To protect infants from HBV infection, CDC recommends that all delivery hospitals institute standing orders or admission orders, and protocols to ensure healthcare professionals do the following: Administer hepatitis B vaccine to 1. all newborns before they are discharged from the hospital. Identify all infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface 2. antigen (HBsAg) positive or to mothers with unknown HBsAg sta - tus. Administer appropriate immunoprophylaxis to these infants. Admission orders / procedures for birthing mothers For pregnant women who have a HBsAg lab report included in their prenatal records, do the following: Examine a copy of the 1. original laboratory report of the pregnant woman's HBsAg1 test result to verify that the correct test (i.e., HB - sAg) was performed and to verify that the testing date was during this pregnancy not a previous one. Do not rely on a handwritten or transcribed HBsAg test result! Place a copy of the original HBsAg lab report into (1) the pregnant 2. woman's L&D record and (2) the infant's hospital record. If the pregnant woman is HBsAg positive, alert the nursery staff that 3. the newborn is high risk and will need postexposure prophylaxis \u2014both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine\u2014within 12 hours of birth. Perform a repeat blood test for HBsAg4. 1 if the pregnant woman was HBsAg negative during a prenatal visit but was at risk for acquiring HBV infection during this pregnancy (e.g., not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship; had an HBsAg-positive sex partner; had evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease; currently uses or recently used in - jection drugs). Instruct the laboratory to call L&D and the nursery with the HBsAg 5. test result ASAP. For pregnant women who do not have an HBsAg lab report on their prenatal record, do the following: Perform HBsAg1. 1 testing ASAP on women who do not have a copy of an original HBsAg laboratory report from the current pregnancy included in their prenatal record. Instruct the lab to call L&D and the nursery units with the newly 2. obtained HBsAg test result ASAP. Admission orders / procedures for newborns Hospital procedures to follow for ALL newborns 1. Review a copy of the mother's original HBsAg1 lab report to ensure that the correct serologic test was ordered and that it was ordered during this pregnancy. 2. Determine if the newborn needs immediate postexposure pro - phylaxis within 12 hours of birth. To do this you must know the mother's HBsAg status and the newborn's birth weight. If the newborn weighs less than 2kg, see the descriptions below and footnotes 2, 5, 6. For newborns of HBsAg-negative mothers Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (0.5 mL, IM) be - 1. fore hospital discharge to all newborns weighing 2 kg or more at birth.2, 3, 4 Document the hepatitis B vaccine dose in the newborn's medi - 2. cal record, including date, time, site of administration, and lot number. Give the mother an immunization record card that includes the 3. hepatitis B vaccination date. Explain the need for the complete hepatitis B vaccine series to protect her baby. Remind her to bring the card with her each time her baby sees a provider. For newborns of mothers with unknown HBsAg status, do the following: Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (0.5 mL, IM) within 1. 12 hours of birth.3, 5 Do not wait for test results to return before giving this dose of vaccine. Document the hepatitis B vaccine dose in the newborn's medical 2. record, including date, time, site of administration, and lot number. Give the mother an immunization record card that includes the 3. hepatitis B vaccination date. Explain the need for the complete hepatitis B vaccine series to protect her baby. Remind her to bring the card with her each time her baby sees a provider. Confirm that the laboratory has received blood for the mother's 4. HBsAg1 test. Verify when the mother's HBsAg result will be available and that 5. it will be reported to L&D and the newborn unit ASAP. If the nursery does not receive the report of the mother's HBsAg 6. test at the expected time, call the laboratory for the result. If the laboratory test indicates the mother's HBsAg7. 1 test result is positive, do the following: a. Administer hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG 0.5 mL, IM) to the newborn ASAP. (Hepatitis B vaccine should have been given within 12 hours of birth.) www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2130.pdf Item #p2130 (5/09) Immunization Action Coalition on next page)b. Document the HBIG dose appropriately in the newborn's medi - cal record. There is little benefit in giving HBIG if more than 7 days have elapsed since birth. c. Alert the mother's and newborn's physician(s) of the test result. d. Follow the instructions below \"For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers,\" steps 3-7. If the newborn must be discharged before the mother's HBsAg result 8. is known: a. Document contact information for the parents (e.g., addresses, telephone numbers, emergency contacts) in case further treatment is needed. b. Obtain the name, address, and phone number of the mother's and the newborn's healthcare providers. c. Notify the mother's and newborn's healthcare providers that the mother's HBsAg test result is pending. For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers Administer HBIG (0.5 mL, IM) and single-antigen hepatitis B 1. vaccine3, 6 (0.5 mL, IM) at separate injection sites within 12 hours of birth. Document the hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG dose in the newborn's 2. medical record, including date, time, site of administration, and lot number. Give the mother an immunization record card that includes the 3. hepatitis B vaccination and HBIG dates. Explain the need for the complete hepatitis B vaccine series to protect her baby. Remind her to bring the card with her each time her baby sees a provider. Notify the local or state health department of the infant's birth 4. and the date and time of administration of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine doses. Obtain the name, address, and phone number of the newborn's 5. primary care provider. Notify the provider of the newborn's birth, the date and time of 6. HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine doses administered, and the impor - tance of additional on-time vaccination and postvaccination testing of the infant for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series. Provide advice to the mother. Tell her the following: 7. a. That she may breast-feed her infant upon delivery, even before hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG are given; b. That it is critical for her infant to complete the full hepatitis B vaccine series on the recommended schedule; c. That blood will need to be drawn from the infant after completion of at least 3 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine series at age 9-18 months (usually done at a well-child visit) to determine if the infant developed a protective immune response to vaccination or needs additional management; d. About modes of HBV transmission and the need for testing and vacci - nation of susceptible household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts; e. That she needs to have a medical evaluation for chronic hepatitis B, including an assessment of whether she is eligible for antiviral treatment. Footnotes 1. Be sure the correct test for HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) was/is ordered. The HBsAg test should not be confused with other hepatitis B serologic tests, including antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs or HBsAb) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc or HBcAb). 2. Infants weighing less than 2 kg at birth and whose mothers are documented to be HBsAg negative should receive the first dose of vaccine 1 month after birth or at hospital discharge, whichever comes first. The mother's HBsAg test result must be part of the infant's medical record. 3. Federal law requires that you give parents a Hepatitis B Vaccine Infor - mation Statement (VIS) before vaccine administration. To obtain a VIS, download it from the IAC website at www.immunize.org/vis or call your state health department. 4. According to the CDC recommendations, exceptions to administering the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine are allowed on a case-by-case basis and only in rare circumstances. If a birth dose is not administered, a copy of the mother's negative HBsAg test result from the current pregnancy must be placed in the infant's medical record and the attending physician must write a specific order directing staff not to administer the birth dose in the hospital. Infants who do not receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine before hospital discharge should receive the first dose no later than age 2 months. 5. An infant weighing less than 2 kg whose mother's HBsAg status is un - known should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Do not count the hepatitis B vaccine dose as the first dose in the vaccine series. Reinitiate the full hepatitis B vaccine series at age 1-2 months. 6. An infant weighing less than 2 kg whose mother is HBsAg positive should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth. Do not count the hepatitis B vaccine dose as the first dose in the vaccine series. Reinitiate the full hepatitis B vaccine series at age 1-2 months.

The recommendations strongly support (1) giving the HepB birth dose to every newborn prior to hospital discharge and (2) using standardized admission orders for administering the birth dose. In addition, it is recommended that a copy of the original maternal hepatitis B lab report be sent to the hospital\u2014 not a transcribed result. The recommendations also state that the HepB birth dose may be delayed until after hospital discharge only \"in rare circumstances.\" When doing so, a physician's order to withhold the birth dose and a copy of the original lab report indicating that the mother was HBsAg negative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record. The latest CDC estimates indicate only 55% of newborns receive the HepB birth dose by 3 days of age. Clearly, there is much work left to do to fully protect newborns. Leading health organizations\u2014CDC, AAP, AAFP, and ACOG \u2014recommend that all hospitals and healthcare professionals protect newborns from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by administering the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) to every baby at birth, no later than hospital discharge. Approximately 24,000 women with chronic HBV infection give birth in the U.S. each year, and many do not know they are infected. Up to 95% of perinatal infections can be prevented by postexposure prophylaxis given within 12 hours of birth. Tragically, many babies are exposed to HBV at birth and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. Infants infected at birth have a greater than 90% chance of becoming chronically infected with HBV. Chronic HBV infection in infants leads to liver cancer, cirrhosis, and liver failure in 25% of these infants when they become adults. Why is a universal birth dose policy necessary in hospitals? Following are some of the ways newborns can be infected if they do not receive a dose of hepatitis B vaccine, ideally within 12 hours of birth: The pregnant woman is tested and found to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, but her \"infected\" status is not communicated to the newborn nursery. The infant receives neither HepB nor HBIG protection at birth. A chronically infected pregnant woman receives the wrong test. For example, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) is ordered in error, instead of HBsAg. This can happen because some labs use the confusing abbreviation HBsAb in - stead of anti-HBs. This misordering of a test is relatively common since the two abbreviations (HBsAg and HBsAb) differ by only one letter. However, when her incorrectly ordered test comes back \"negative,\" the woman may actu - ally be HBsAg positive and her infant would not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. The pregnant woman is HBsAg positive, but her test results are misinterpreted or mistranscribed into her prenatal record or her infant's chart. As a result, her infant does not receive HBIG or HepB. The pregnant woman is not tested for HBsAg either prenatally or in the hospital at the time of delivery. In one study, women who didn't receive prenatal care were eight times more likely to be HBsAg positive than women who received prena - tal care. When a woman does not receive prenatal care and is not tested at the time of delivery, her infant is in danger of being infected with HBV at birth\u2014unless he or she is born in a hospital that adheres to a policy of administering HepB within 12-24 hours of birth to every newborn without fail. This provides the greatest effectiveness in preventing HBV infection. She develops HBV infection later in pregnancy, but it is not clinically detected. Because her initial HBsAg test result is negative, she is not retested later in pregnancy as CDC recommends for high- risk women, and her infant does not receive HepB or HBIG at birth. The mother is HBsAg negative, but the infant is exposed to HBV postnatally from another family member or caregiver. This occurs in two-thirds of the cases of childhood transmission. State perinatal hepatitis B coordinators provided hundreds of reports of newborns who were unprotected or inadequately protected because of medical errors. In 2001, 2002, and 2008, the Immunization Ac - tion Coalition surveyed perinatal hepatitis B coor - dinators at every state health department, as well as at city and county CDC projects to assess their views about providing hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital. Their responses contained hundreds of reports of newborns who were unprotected or inad - equately protected because healthcare profession - als failed to order or misordered hepatitis B blood tests or misinterpreted, mistranscribed, or miscom - municated the test results of the children's mothers (see www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2062.pdf). These state coordinators' reports tell us that no matter how well healthcare providers think they are doing in screening all pregnant women for HBsAg, mistakes continue to occur. Newborns are are unnecessarily being exposed without the benefit of postexposure prophylaxis. At least one baby has died of fulminant hepatitis B; hundreds have become chronically infected and are doomed to preventable hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis later in life. To overcome these failures, perinatal hepatitis B coordinators overwhelmingly endorse providing a HepB birth dose as the first step in de - veloping a safety net to protect all infants from HBV infection, regardless of the circumstances. To maximally protect every newborn, CDC, AAP, AAFP, and ACOG recommend all infants be vac - cinated with a HepB birth dose prior to hospital discharge. Delaying hepatitis B vaccination until a follow-up office visit will be too late to prevent perinatal HBV transmission.* State perinatal hepatitis B coordinators surveyed overwhelmingly endorsed providing the birth dose. HepB is a highly effective vaccine. Studies have shown that infants of the most highly infectious mothers (women who are both HBsAg and HBeAg positive) who receive postexposure prophylaxis with HepB alone (without HBIG) at birth are pro - tected in 70%-95% of cases. Please read the hepa - titis coordinators' survey results (www.immunize. org/birthdose), including descriptions of their ex - periences with failures of the system \u2014failures that largely will be prevented by administering HepB to infants before they go home from the hospital, ideally within 12 hours of birth. Your support for providing a birth dose to new - borns while they are still in the hospital will protect and save lives that are now being put at risk. *For subsequent doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) in infants, use monovalent HepB or hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines. If using hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines, you will be giving 3 more doses of HepB. Giving a total of 4 doses of HepB to infants is acceptable practice to CDC, AAP, and AAFP. These vaccine doses are covered under the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program for VFC- eligible children.

CDC states it is not necessary for the patient to disclose a risk factor to receive hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who are at risk for sexual exposure: Sexually active persons who are not in long-term, mutually monogamous relationships Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons Persons seeking evaluation or treatment for an STD Men who have sex with men Persons at risk for infection by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood: Injection-drug users, current or past Household contacts of HBsAg-positive persons Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally challenged persons Healthcare and public safety workers with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids Persons with end-stage renal disease and those receiving dialysis Others: Travelers to areas with moderate or high rates of HBV infection Persons with chronic (life-long) liver disease Persons with HIV infection Refugees, immigrants, and adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic should have hepatitis B testing. Adults should discuss their need or desire for hepatitis B vaccination with their healthcare providers. For certain people at risk, p ostvaccination testing is recommended. Consult ACIP recommendations for details (see references). www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2110.pdf Item #P2110 (6/10) Who should be vaccinated? Hepatitis B lab nomenclature HBsAg: Hepatitis B surface antigen is a marker of infectivity. Its presence indicates either acute or chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBs: Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen is a marker of immunity. Its presence indicates an immune response to HBV infection, an immune response to vaccination, or the presence of passively acquired antibody. (It is also known as HBsAb, but this abbreviation is best avoided since it is often confused with abbreviations such as HBsAg.) Anti-HBc (total): Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen is a nonspecific marker of acute, chronic, or resolved HBV infection. It is not a marker of vaccine- induced immunity. It may be used in prevaccination testing to determine previous exposure to HBV infection. (It is also known as HBcAb, but this abbre - viation is best avoided since it is often confused with other abbreviations.) IgM anti-HBc: IgM antibody subclass of anti-HBc. Positivity indicates recent infection with HBV (within the past 6 mos). Its presence indicates acute infection. HBeAg: Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen is a marker of a high degree of HBV infectivity, and it correlates with a high level of HBV replication. It is primarily used to help determine the clinical management of patients with chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBe: Antibody to hepatitis B \"e\" antigen may be present in an infected or immune person. In persons with chronic HBV infection, its presence suggests a low viral titer and a low degree of infectivity. HBV-DNA: HBV Deoxyribonucleic acid is a marker of viral replication. It correlates well with infectivity. It is used to assess and monitor the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.Managing chronic HBV infection When you identify a patient who is chronically infected with HBV, make sure you consult a specialist knowledgeable in the treatment of liver disease so your patient's care is optimized. Chronically infected persons need medi - cal evaluation every 6-12 months to assess the status of their liver health and their need for antiviral therapy, as well as to screen for liver cancer. In addition, persons with chronic HBV infection should be educated about their disease and how to protect others. Household members and sex partners should be tested for HBV infection (HBsAg and antiHBs) and given the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at the same visit. (Vaccinating a person who has already been infected will do no harm). If testing indicates HBV susceptibility, complete the hepatitis B vaccination series. If testing indicates the presence of HBV infection, consultation and further care with a physician knowledgeable about chronic hepatitis B is needed. Serologic testing prior to vaccination may be undertaken based on your as - sessment of your patient's level of risk and your or your patient's need for definitive information (see information in the left column). If you decide to test, draw the blood first, and then give the first dose of vaccine at the same office visit. Vaccination can then be continued, if needed, based on the results of the tests. If you are not sure who needs hepatitis B testing, consult your state or local health department.About hepatitis B serologic testing Immunization Action Coalition 1573 St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.org 1.

Sincerely, ____________________________________ ____________________________________ Clinician's signature Clinician's name (print or type)What the Physician Can Do to Help the Child with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Sarah Jane Schwarzenberg, M.D. Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition University of Minnesota Although children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may follow many different clinical courses, these recommendations will help all of them maintain good health. 1. A yearly physical Every child with hepatitis B needs a yearly check-up with his/her primary physician to make sure the child is healthy and growing normally. 2. Laboratory studies to monitor liver health At the first clinical visit, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), INR, a complete blood count, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound are usually obtained. Thereafter, liver enzymes should be checked yearly in the healthy child with HBV . 3. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma There are no definitive guidelines for screening children with HBV for hepatocellular carcinoma. AFP is a tumor marker and is increased in 85% of individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma, often before clinical evidence of cancer is present. It may be elevated at a time when the tumor can be resected completely. We recommend yearly AFP in the child with HBV , and twice yearly testing with hepatic ultrasound in the child with cirrhosis and HBV . It should be noted that even close monitoring of these tests does not guarantee early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 4. Hepatitis B testing every 3-5 years Few children convert from HBsAg to anti-HBs (HBsAb), especially if they acquired the disease in the perinatal period. It is important to occasionally check to see if the patient is still infected. 5. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist Any child with an AST >2 times the upper limit of normal, evidence of hepatic dysfunction, failure to thrive, an elevated AFP, a need for family counseling, or abnormalities on hepatic ultrasound should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation. 6. Treatment Although medications are available to treat hepatitis B, they are generally useful only in patients with on-going hepatic injury (active hepatitis). Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist will help identify those patients who would benefit from medical therapy. 7. Vaccination of household members All members of the child's household and caregivers who have close contact with the child should be vaccinated against hepatitis B, even if pregnant. 8. Hepatitis B education Each child with hepatitis B and his/her parents should receive age-appropriate hepatitis B education. This should include methods for prevention of transmission of the virus and assistance for the child in dealing with his/her positivity throughout the school years and as a teenager. Older children should receive counseling on the use of condoms to prevent viral transmission to their sexual partners. 9. Maintaining personal health Immunization against hepatitis A is recommended to prevent a second injury to the liver. Ethanol should be avoided. When prescribing other medications, care must be taken to avoid or monitor those with known hepatotox - icity.

Different serologic \"markers\" or combinations of markers are used to identify different phases of HBV infection and to determine whether a patient has acute or chronic HBV infection, is immune to HBV as a result of prior infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection.Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): A protein on the surface of hepatitis B virus; it can be detected in high levels in serum during acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The presence of HBsAg indicates that the person is infectious. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs): The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating recovery and immunity from hepatitis B virus infection. Anti-HBs also develops in a person who has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B. Total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc): Appears at the onset of symptoms in acute hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with hepatitis B virus in an unde ned time frame. IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc): Positivity indicates recent infection with hepatitis B virus ( <6 mos). Its presence indicates acute infection.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Viral Hepatitis www.cdc.gov/hepatitis1573 Selby Avenue, Suite 234 St. Paul, #P4090 (8/07) (continued on next page )QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY ASKED ABOUT HEPATITIS B What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem that affects people of all ages in the U.S. and around the world. In 2006, an estimated 46,000 people contracted hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. Hepatitis B is caused by a highly infectious virus that attacks the liver and can lead to severe illness, liver damage, and in some cases, death. The best way to be protected from hepa - titis B is to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, a vaccine used in the U.S. for more than two decades and proved safe and effective. Who is at risk for HBV infection? About 5% of people in the U.S. will get infected with HBV sometime during their lives if they are not vaccinated. You might be infected with HBV and not even know it. If you engage in certain activities, your risk might be much higher. You might be at risk if you have a job that exposes you to human blood share a household with someone who has chronic (lifelong) HBV infection inject drugs have sex with a person infected with HBV are sexually active but not in a long- term, mutually monogamous relation - ship are a man who has sex with men received a blood transfusion before 1975, when excellent blood testing became available are a person who was born, or who has a parent born, in Asia, Africa, the Amazon River Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East were adopted from Asia, Africa, the Amazon River Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East have hemophilia are a patient or worker in an institution for developmentally challenged people are an inmate of a correctional facility travel internationally to areas with mod- erate or high rates of HBV infection How is HBV spread? HBV is found in the blood of people infected with the virus and certain of their body fluids, such as serum, semen, and vaginal secretions. HBV is not found in sweat, tears, urine, or respiratory secre - tions. Contact with microscopic amounts of infected blood can cause infection. Hepatitis B virus can be spread by unprotected sex injection drug use an HBV-infected mother to her child during birth contact with blood or open sores of an HBV-infected person human bites from an HBV-infected person sharing a household with a person with chronic (lifelong) HBV infection sharing items such as razors, tooth - brushes, or washcloths pre-chewing food for babies or sharing chewing gum using unsterilized needles in ear- or body-piercing, tattooing, or acupuncture using the same immunization needle on more than one personHepatitis B virus IS NOT spread by casual contact, like holding hands eating food prepared by an infected person kissing or hugging sharing silverware, plates, or cups visiting an infected person's home sneezing or coughing breastfeeding What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? Most babies and young children who get HBV infection don't look or feel sick at all. About half of adults who get infected don't have any symptoms or signs of the disease. If people do have signs or symp - toms, they might experience any or all of the following: loss of appetite nausea, vomiting fever weakness, fatigue, inability to work for weeks or months abdominal pain yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) joint pain cola-colored urine clay-colored stools I'm not in a risk group. How did I get HBV infection? Many people don't know when or how they got the infection. When they get the results of a blood test indicating they've been infected with HBV , they are taken by surprise. Studies have demonstrated that about 15% of people who acquire hepatitis B are unable to identify a risk factor that explains why they have the disease. T echnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Aug. 2007.Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018(continued on next page )Do people usually recover from HBV infection? About 95% of adults recover after several months. They clear the infection from their bodies and become immune. This means they won't get infected with HBV again. They are no longer contagious and cannot pass HBV to others. Unfortunately, about 5% of adults and up to 90% of children under age 5 years are unable to clear the infection from their bodies and develop chronic HBV infection. How do I know if I have or have had HBV infection? The only way to know if you are current - ly infected with HBV , have recovered, are chronically infected, or could become in - fected, is by having blood tests. The three standard blood tests are the following: HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"reactive,\" it means the person is currently infected with HBV and is able to pass the infec - tion on to others. Anti-HBs [sometimes written as HBs-Ab] (antibody to hepatitis B sur - face antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"reactive,\" it means the person is immune to HBV infection, either from vaccination or from past infection. (This test is not done routinely by most blood banks on donated blood.) Anti-HBc [sometimes written as HBc-Ab] (antibody to hepatitis B core antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"re - active,\" it might mean the person has had contact with HBV . This is a very compli - cated test to explain because the \"anti- HBc\" can possibly be a \"false-positive\" test result. Blood banks routinely run an \"anti-HBc\" on donated blood. The inter - pretation of this test result, if it is posi - tive, depends on the results of the other two blood tests previously described. A fourth blood test that is sometimes done is IgM anti-HBc (IgM class anti - body to hepatitis B core antigen). When this is positive or \"reactive,\" it means that the person has had HBV infection in the past six months, indicating acute (recent - ly acquired) HBV infection. Interpretation of the hepatitis B blood test results *Postvaccination blood testing, when it is recommended, should be done 1-2 months after the final vaccine dose. 1. May be recovering from acute HBV infection. 2. May be distantly immune, and the test is not sensitive enough to detect a very low level of antiHBs in serum. 3. May be susceptible with a \"false posi tive\" antiHBc. 4. May be chronically infected and have an undetectable level of HBsAg present in the serum.susceptible immune due to vaccination immune due to natural infection newly infected chronically infected four interpretations negative negative negative positive with >10mIU/mL* negative positive positive positive positive positive negative positive positive negative negative negative positive negativeTests Results Interpretation Vaccination Needed Yes, for all people who want protection no no no no (may need treatment) possibly What does it mean if my blood bank said I tested positive for hepatitis B and can no longer donate blood? If the blood bank told you your test was \"positive,\" it is important to find out which test was positive. If the \"HBsAg\" was positive, this means that you are either chronically infected with HBV or were recently infected. If only the \"anti-HBc\" was positive, it is most likely that you either had a \"false-positive\" test or are immune to HBV infection (had HBV infection sometime in the past). It is important that you understand the full meaning of your test results. If you are not sure how to interpret these test results, call your blood bank for an explanation or have the blood bank send the test results to your healthcare provider. You may need to provide written permission for the blood bank to release these results to your healthcare pro - vider. Your healthcare provider may want to repeat the blood tests or perform additional tests such as an \"anti-HBs.\" Bring this information sheet along with you on your visit to your healthcare provider. The blood bank does not usually test for anti-HBs or IgM anti-HBc. And remember, you cannot get HBV from donating blood because the equipment used during blood donation is sterile. CHRONIC HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION What does it mean to be chronically infected with HBV? People who do not recover from HBV infection are chronically infected, usually for life. There are over one million chron - ically infected people in the U.S. today. A chronically infected person is someone who has had HBV in her/his blood for more than 6 months. While approxi - mately 5% of adults who acquire HBV infection become chronically infected, children younger than age 5 years have a greater risk (up to 90%). The younger the child is at the time of infection, the greater the risk that the child will develop chronic infection. Many babies born to chronically infected mothers will also become chronically infected with HBV unless the babies are given two shots in the hospital immediately after birth\u2014the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG])\u2014and at least two doses of hepa - titis B vaccine during the 6 months after Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018(continued on next page )birth to protect them from the infection. The final dose should not be given before 24 weeks of age. A chronically infected person might have no signs or symptoms of HBV infection but usually remains infected for years or for a lifetime and is capable of passing HBV on to others. Some - times chronically infected people will spontaneously clear the infection from their bodies, but most will not. Although most chronically infected people have no serious problems with hepatitis B and lead normal, healthy lives, some develop liver problems later. Chronically infected people are at significantly higher risk than the general population for liver fail - ure or liver cancer. How can I take care of myself if I am chronically infected with HBV? A person with HBV infection should see a physician knowledgeable about the management of liver disease every 6-12 months. The physician will do blood tests to check the health of the liver, as well as test for evidence of liver cancer. It is best for chronically infected people to avoid alcohol because alcohol can injure the liver. Additionally, your physician should know about all the medicines you are tak - ing, even over-the-counter drugs, because some medicines can hurt the liver. If the result of any liver test is abnormal, it's important that you consult a liver specialist. If your liver disease has progressed... If your physician tells you your liver dis - ease has progressed, read the following for some extra precautions you should take. Avoid alcohol and medicine that has not been prescribed by your doctor\u2014even over-the-counter medicines. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A virus infection can further damage your liver. Get a yearly influenza (flu) vaccination. Patients with severe liver disease (cir - rhosis) should also receive pneumococ - cal vaccine. Don't eat raw oysters. They may carry the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, which can cause serious blood infections in people with liver disease. Approximately 50% of people with this blood infection die from it. What can I do to protect others from HBV infection? People with HBV infection might feel healthy but are still capable of passing the infection on to other people. To protect others from getting HBV infection, it is important to protect them from contact with your infected blood and other infec - tious body fluids, including semen and vaginal secretions. Sweat, tears, urine, and respiratory secretions do not contain HBV . Transmission of HBV by saliva has only been documented through biting. Important DOs and DON'Ts for people with chronic HBV infection DO: Cover all cuts and open sores with a bandage. Discard used items such as bandaids and menstrual pads carefully so no one is accidentally exposed to your blood. Wash your hands well after touching your blood or infectious body fluids. Clean up blood spills. Then reclean the area with a bleach solution (one part household chlorine bleach to 10 parts water). Tell your sex partner(s) you have hepatitis B so they can be tested and vaccinated (if not already infected). Sex partners should be tested for anti- HBs 1-2 months after the three doses are completed to be sure the vaccine worked. Use condoms (rubbers) during sex un - less your sex partner has had hepatitis B or has been vaccinated and has had the anti-HBs blood test demonstrating immunity. (Condoms may also protect you from other sexually transmitted diseases.) Tell household members to see their healthcare providers for testing and vaccination for hepatitis B. Tell your healthcare providers that you are chronically infected with HBV . See your healthcare provider every 6-12 months to check the health of your liver with blood tests and liver scanning. If you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider that you have HBV infection. It is critical that your baby is started on the hepatitis B shots (both vaccine and HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. DON'T: Don't share chewing gum, toothbrush - es, razors, washcloths, needles for ear or body piercing, or anything that might have come in contact with your blood or infectious body fluids Don't pre-chew food for babies. Don't share syringes and needles. Don't donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, or sperm. Don't take any medicines not pre - scribed by your doctor, even over-the- counter medicines. What are the long-term effects of HBV infection? Each year, approximately 3,000-5,000 people in the U.S. die of HBV-related chronic liver disease. HBV infection is the most common cause of liver cancer worldwide and ranks second only to tobacco as the world's leading cause of cancer. Is there a cure for hepatitis B? As of this writing, there are several drugs used for the treatment of people with chronic hepatitis B. These drugs usually don't get rid of the virus completely, but may reduce your risk for serious liver disease such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Check with your doctor to find out if treatment with medication is the right choice for you. Researchers continue to find additional treatments and look for cures for hepatitis B.Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018Why is hepatitis B so serious in pregnant women? Pregnant women who are infected with HBV can transmit the disease to their babies. If babies aren't protected with vaccinations, many of them develop life - long HBV infections, and up to 25% of those who become infected will develop liver failure or liver cancer later in life. All pregnant women should be tested early in every pregnancy to determine if they are infected with HBV . If the blood test is positive, the baby should be vaccinated within 12 hours of birth with two shots, one of HBIG and the other the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine. The in - fant will need at least two more doses of hepatitis B vaccine by age 6 months. The final dose should not be given before age 24 weeks. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Hepatitis B vaccine can provide pro - tection in 90%-95% of healthy young adults. The vaccine can safely be given to infants, children, and adults, including pregnant women. Usually, three doses of vaccine are given over a 6-month period. Hepatitis B vaccine is very safe, and side effects are rare. Since 1982, more than 100 million children, teens, and adults in the U.S. have been vaccinated. Hepa - titis B vaccine is our first vaccine that prevents cancer\u2014liver cancer. At what age are hepatitis B vaccines given routinely? The hepatitis B vaccine series can begin at any age. For newborns, it's recom - mended that the first dose be given in the hospital at birth. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 0-18 years living in the U.S. Older children and teens should be vaccinated at the earliest opportunity. Any adult who is at risk for HBV infection or who simply wants to be protected from HBV infection should start the vaccine series right away.Where can I get hepatitis B vaccine? Check with your healthcare provider's office first. Children's health insurance usually covers the cost of this vaccine since it is routinely recommended for all children in the U.S. If your child is unin - sured, ask your local health department for assistance. The federal Vaccines For Children (VFC) program helps families by providing free vaccines to healthcare providers who serve eligible children. VFC is administered at the national level by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which contracts with vaccine manufacturers to buy vaccines at reduced rates. For adults, contact your healthcare provider to find out if the vaccine is available and how much it costs. If you are uninsured or don't have a healthcare provider, call your local health department for advice. How many doses of vaccine are needed? Three doses are needed usually for the best protection against HBV infection, but protection is sometimes provided from receiving as little as one dose. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given on a schedule of 0, 1, and 6 months, but there is flexibility in the timing of these injections. As with all other vaccines, if you fall behind on the schedule, you just continue from where you left off. Hepatitis B vaccine will not help or cure a person who is already infected with HBV . What should I do if I'm in a risk group and am not infected with HBV? If you are in a risk group for hepatitis B, be sure to get vaccinated! All people in risk groups (risk groups are listed in the second question on this question-and- answer series) should protect themselves from HBV infection. You don't have to \"admit\" that you have a risk factor to be vaccinated. You simply need to ask to be vaccinated. Every day you delay getting vaccinated increases your chances of being in contact with this highly conta - gious liver disease. The problems caused by hepatitis B\u2014liver cancer and liver failure\u2014are too great to take a chance. See your healthcare provider or visit your health department. How does hepatitis B differ from hepatitis A and C? Hepatitis A, B, and C are all different viruses that attack and injure the liver, and all can cause similar symptoms. Usually, people get hepatitis A virus (HA V) infection from household or sexual contact with a person who has the infection. Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is spread through HCV-infected blood. Both HCV- and HBV- infections are spread by blood through some of the same activi - ties (e.g., injection drug use). Both HBV- and HCV- infections can cause lifelong liver problems. HA V infection does not. Vaccines to prevent HA V infection are also available. Hepatitis A vaccine won't protect you from HBV or HCV infection, nor will hepatitis B vaccine protect you from HA V or HCV infec - tion. There is no vaccine yet for hepatitis C. If you've been infected with HA V or HCV in the past, it is still possible to get infected with HBV . Where can I receive more information about hepatitis B?

The Immunization Action Coalition is a nonprofit organization that works to pre - vent hepatitis B and all other vaccine- preventable diseases in people of all ages. IAC promotes hepatitis B vaccina - tion, screening for all pregnant women, testing and vaccination for risk groups, and education and treatment for people with chronic HBV infection.IAC relies on financial support from the CDC, corporations, foundations, health - care providers, and individuals to maintain its activities. Financial contributions are always needed, greatly appreciated, and tax-deductible. You can send your check to IAC at the address below or donate online at www.immunize.org/support. Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby Ave., Suite admin@immunize.org www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.org (HBV) infection . . . If you have chronic hepatitis B virus infec - tion (HBV), you are not alone. Today, approximately one million people in the United States are chronically infected with HBV. The majority of infected people feel healthy for their entire lives and do not demonstrate any evidence of ongoing liver damage. Other people progress to levels of more severe disease. Some people ultimately develop liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, or liver cancer. It is important that you take care of yourself. And because it is possible to spread HBV to others, you have to know how to protect your family, friends, and others from this disease. How you can take care of yourself People who have chronic HBV infection need regular monitoring of their liver condition to determine whether their disease is progressing, whether treatment is needed, or whether a liver cancer is developing. Make sure you do the following: See your doctor for evaluation of your liver's condition once or twice a year. Certain blood tests need to be performed periodically to monitor your liver's health. Discuss with your doctor if you are a candidate for antiviral medication. These medicines are given to certain people with chronic liver disease. Discuss with your doctor about getting periodic ultrasounds, alpha-fetoprotein blood tests, or other studies to make sure there is no evidence of a developing liver cancer. Physicians may recommend different schedules for ultrasounds and blood tests depending on the patient's age, sex, ethnicity, age at which the infection was initially acquired, family history, HBeAg status, and liver enzymes. Usually, ultrasounds and blood tests are recommended every six to 12 months. Review with your physician all medica - tions you take. Even some \"over-the- counter\" medications can injure your liver. If you are pregnant, tell your physician that you have chronic HBV infection. It is essential that your baby be given an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and started on the hepatitis B vaccine series within 12 hours of birth. Avoid alcoholic beverages. Alcohol can damage your liver.If your doctor tells you your liver disease has progressed... If your liver disease progresses, here are some extra precautions you should take: Get your yearly influenza vaccine. Patients with severe liver disease should also receive pneumococcal poly - saccharide vaccine. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A can further damage your liver. Don't eat raw oysters. Raw oysters may carry the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus which can cause a serious blood infection in individuals with liver disease. Approxi - mately 40% of these cases are fatal. How to protect others from HBV infection People can get HBV infection from you by coming in contact with your blood, serum, semen, or vaginal fluids. HBV has also been transmitted by human bites. Although HBV has been detected in low concentrations in other body fluids, including tears, sweat, urine, feces, and breast milk, these fluids have not been associated with any docu - mented transmission. Fortunately, HBV is not transmitted by sneezing or coughing, or from casual contact such as holding hands. Here are some important guidelines for you to follow so that others are protected: Tell your sex partner(s) that you are infected with HBV. Your sex partner(s) must see a physician for hepatitis B blood testing and should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at this same visit. If, according to the blood tests, your partner has never had hepatitis B, he or she should complete the vaccination se - ries. One to two months after the series of three shots is completed, your partner needs to return to the doctor for blood testing to make sure the vaccine protected him or her. Use condoms until your part - ner is proven to be protected from HBV. Make sure all your household members see their physicians for hepatitis B testing and vaccination. Tell your healthcare providers that you are infected with HBV. Cover all cuts and open sores with a bandage. Throw away used personal items such as tissues or menstrual pads in a bag that does not leak so others will not be ex - posed to your blood. Wash your hands well after touching your blood or body fluids. More resources...

Then reclean the area with bleach solution (one part regular household bleach to 10 parts water). Do not share toothbrushes, razors, needles for ear piercing, nail files, clippers, nail scissors, washcloths, or anything that may have come in contact with your blood or body fluids. Do not share food that has been in your mouth (e.g., chewing gum) and do not pre-chew food for babies. Do not share syringes, needles, or drugs. Do not donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, or sperm. Know that if someone is exposed to your blood\u2014be it a family member, a friend, or even a stranger\u2014 preventive treatment is available for that person. If the exposed person receives HBIG and starts the hepatitis B vaccine series right away, that person has an excellent chance of being protected from HBV!

Last updated on 4/26/2011 CS220486-B HEPATITIS B VACCINE 1What is hepatitis B?W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Hepatitis B is a serious disease that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBVcan cause: Acute (short-term) illness. This can lead to: of appetite \u0081 diarrhea and vomiting\u0081 tiredness \u0081 jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)\u0081 pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Acute illness is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not haveacute illness. Chronic (long-term) infection . Some people go on to develop chronic HBV infection. This can be veryserious, and often leads to:\u0081liver damage (cirrhosis) \u0081liver cancer \u0081death Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who areinfected can spread HBV to others, even if they don'tappear sick. \u0081 In 2005, about 51,000 people became infected with hepatitis B. \u0081 About 1.25 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infection. \u0081 Each year about 3,000 to 5,000 people die from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by HBV . Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. Aperson can become infected by: - contact with a mother's blood and body fluids at the time of birth; - contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores; - contact with objects that could have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes or razors; - having unprotected sex with an infected person; - sharing needles when injecting drugs;- being stuck with a used needle on the job.Children and Adolescents \u0081 All children should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and should have completed the vaccine series by 6-18 months of age. \u0081 Children and adolescents through 18 years of age who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. Adults \u0081 All unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. This includes: - sex partners of people infected with HBV ,- men who have sex with men,- people who inject street drugs,- people with more than one sex partner,- people with chronic liver or kidney disease,- people with jobs that expose them to human blood, - household contacts of people infected with HBV ,- residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled, - kidney dialysis patients,Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of HBV infection, includingliver cancer and cirrhosis. Routine hepatitis B vaccination of U.S. children began in 1991. Since then, the reported incidence ofacute hepatitis B among children and adolescentshas dropped by more than 95% - and by 75% in allage groups. Hepatitis B vaccine is made from a part of the hepatitis B virus. It cannot cause HBV infection. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a series of 3 or 4 shots . This vaccine series gives long-term protection from HBV infection, possibly lifelong. 2Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated? 3Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when?Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis.- people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common, - people with HIV infection. \u0081 Anyone else who wants to be protected from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 4Who should NOT get hepatitis B vaccine? \u0081 Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to baker's yeast , or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies. \u0081 Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose. \u0081 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Y our provider can give you more information about these precautions. Pregnant women who need protection from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 5Hepatitis B vaccine risks Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The following mild problems have been reported: \u0081 Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4). \u0081 T emperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15). Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1million doses. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in theUnited States. 6What if there is a moderate or severe reaction?8How can I learn more? \u0081 Ask your doctor or nurse. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. \u0081 Call your local or state health department.\u0081 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) - Visit CDC websites at: www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitiswww.cdc.gov/vaccines www.cdc.gov/travel7The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program In the event that you or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine, a federal program has beencreated to help pay for the care of those who havebeen harmed.

VAERS does not provide medical advice. 29 INFECTIOUS DISEASE SEROLOGY 404-327-7970 INTRODUCTION The Microbial Immunology Unit performs infectious disease serolog y. Serology for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), is performed in the Virology Unit . Various serologic procedures are performed for a variety of bacterial, parasitic, and viral agents. Hepatitis serology is performed for county health departments, and Georgia Department of Public Health agencies, only. Tests not performed in the Public Health Laboratory are forwarded to CDC, if they provide the requested testing. SPECIMEN COLLECTION/LABELING/REQUISITION FORM Collection Using Universal Precautions, and standard venipun cture technique, collect approximately six milliliters of whole blood (for serum) in a red top tube (no additive), labeled with patient's identifier (name, first and last, or number), date, and name of the submitter. Use a marker that will not fade, smear , or run during transportation. Use proper size needle (large enough to prevent hemolysis of the red blood cells) for the vein location and age of the patient. Allow blood specimen to clot, at least 30 minutes undisturbed, at room temperature, and transport, or place in the refrigerator for transporting. Collect blood specimens in, or transfer them to , non-breakable, leak resistant tubes. Specimens should be transported as soon as possible, do not hold over 7 days. Specimens over 14 days old are unaccept able. Many of the procedures we perform are not approved for use with plasma. Therefore, please submit only serum or whole blood without anticoagulants, not plasma. Collect cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) according to proper hospital procedure. CSF contaminat ed with blood or grossly contaminated with bacteria is unacceptable. Labeling All specimens must be labeled with patient identification (name or number), in acceptable testing condition, and accompanied by a completed requisition form. If the form is not specific for one test or a set of tests, the specific testing requested must be hand- written in the proper area, e.g., \"viral serology\" is not acceptable, the specific agent, e.g., \"CMV\", must be clearly requested. Failure to provide proper patient inf ormation may result in testing delays. Requisition Form Use Form #3432 for all tests performed by the Microbial Immunology Unit. There is a single requisition form for all serological tests performed, including the RPR and EIA tests for syphilis, Hepati tis B (DCH facilities and county health departments only), and other Serology. Completely fill out the form and include the following information: 1. Unique patient identifier (name or number). 2. TEST(S) REQUESTED (Please check only the corresponding box for t est(s) requested). 30 3. Date specimen collected. 4. Submitter's name, address, and code number, where applicable. 5. For hepatitis the reason for testing, e.g., routine, or prenatal. 6. Any information the submitter needs for pa tient identification, e.g., chart number, address. 7. The date of onset of illness, if applicable. 8. Race, sex, and age, where applicable, e.g., hepatitis testing. SHIPMENT OF SPECIMENS Use outfit #0500, available from Laboratory Services and Supply, 404- 327-7920, and follow the specific instructio ns below. Specimens may be mailed or delivered to the laboratory by courier. Shipping Instructions for USPS and Couriers: Place the tubes of blood in protective, leak resistant, double- walled containers, e.g., aluminum and cardboard box, for transport. Wrap the requisition form around the inner (aluminum) can, secure with a rubber band and place in the outer container. If a screw -cap outer container is used, the screw -cap must be secured with tape or the Postal Service will return it for taping. Up to 50 milliliters of blood may be transported in one package (U.S. postal regulations). Therefore, an individual tube of blood may be placed in the metal can, with the requisition form secured to the outside by a rubber band, and several aluminum cans placed in one cardboard box for transporting. Shipping Instructions for Courier Services Only: Tubes of blood may be placed in leak proof biohazard bags. Wrap brown absorbent material around the tube, then secure with a rubber band. Place the requisition form in the sleeve located on the outside of the bag. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Table 1 (pages IV -61 through IV -63) summarizes the interpretation of results for all serological tests performed in the Microbial Immunology Unit. Table 2 (pag e IV-64) gives the turnaround times for all of the same serological tests. The turnaround time after receipt of the specimen depends on the testing methodology and the frequency of testing. The frequency of testing depends on the demand for a specific te st. Several tests are performed daily, while others are performed weekly. The turn- around time for specimens referred to CDC depends on CDC's schedule, which varies from laboratory to laboratory. UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS 1. Spinal fluid obviously contami nated with bacteria or blood; 2. All specimens: 31 Not approved for testing by the indicated method, e.g., plasma for RPR. Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, turbid, or contaminated. Over 14 days old. Broken in transit. Insufficient quantity for testi ng. No identification on specimen. Name on tube and form does not match. The submitter will be notified of all rejected specimens. Most serologic services are available to both the public and private sectors. However, hepatitis B testing is limited to the public health care providers, and not available to the private providers. 32 Test Result Interpretation1 Agent Test Method IgG Detected No IgM Detected IgG Detected IgM Detected IgM detected and/or significant rise in titer between paired sera 4,5 IgM Equivocal in titer between paired sera4 > 1:16 Hepatitis A Total IgG EIA Negative Positive IgM EIA Negative Positive Presumptive evidence of IgM antibodies to HAV Hepatitis C EIA Negative Positive s/co>/=10; samples confirm >/=95% positive. <10; confirm with Riba positive 2 or more 1+ bands.

Hepatitis - 2/2012 State Hepatitis Program 1 State He patitis Pro gram Background: The State Hepatitis Program provides hepatitis B vaccine w hen indicated to eligible children and adults through the Perinatal He patitis B Prevention Program, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, and the STD/HI V Program and Family Planning Program. Hepatitis A vaccine is provi ded to eligible children through the Vaccines for Children Program, high-risk adults, and to both child ren and adults in out break situations. Groups recommended for routine vaccination: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all persons aged zero through 18 years, and adults at highest risk for the hepatitis B virus. These high-risk groups are as follows: \u0083 Persons with occupational risk \u0083 Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled \u0083 Hemodialysis patients \u0083 Recipients of cert ain blood products \u0083 Household contacts and sexual partners of HBV carriers \u0083 Adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic \u0083 International travelers who plan to spend more than 6 months in areas with high rates of HBV infection and who wil l have close contact with the local population \u0083 Injecting drug users (IDU) \u0083 Sexually active men w ho have sex with men (MSM) \u0083 Sexually active heterosexual men and women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually trans mitted diseases, and for persons who have a history of sexual activity with more than one partner in the previous 6 months. NOTE: Persons seen for evaluation of sexually transmitted diseases should be considered candidates for vaccination \u0083 Inmates of long-term correctional facilities \u0083 Diabetics (type 1 or type 2) Hepatitis A Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for persons aged > 12 months of age who are at increased risk for infection or seve re outcomes from the disease. These groups include the following: \u0083 Travelers to countries w here hepatitis A is endemic \u0083 Close contacts of an internationa l adoptee from a country of high or intermediate endemicity \u0083 Men who have sex with men (MSM) \u0083 Users of illegal inject ing and non-injecting drugs \u0083 Persons with clotting-factor disorders \u0083 Persons with chronic liver disease \u0083 Persons with occupational ri sk (working with nonhuman primates) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 State Hepatitis Program 2 State He patitis Pro gram Provision of vaccine for routine vaccina tion by the State Hepatitis Program: The State Immunization Progr am provides hepatitis B vaccine to VFC and PeachCare eligible children aged birth through 18 years, household and sexual contacts to acute and chronic hepatitis B cases (which includ es perinatal cases), and persons seeking evaluation for an STD at a public STD/ HIV or Family Planning testing: Prevaccination hepatitis B: Prevaccination serology is not indicated befo re routine vaccination of infants, children and adults. Prevaccination serology sh ould be performed on persons who are at highest risk for infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Those clients at highest risk are defined as: \u0084 Injecting drug users (IDU) \u0084 Sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) \u0084 Sexually active heterosexual men and women with more than one sex partner within a 6 month period \u0084 Alaska Natives \u0084 Pacific Islanders \u0084 Children of immigrants from endemic countries \u0084 Family members of hepatitis B surfac e antigen (HBsAg) positive persons Persons being evaluated in STD/ HIV and Family Planning clinics should first be assessed for risk factors and serologic testing performed if indicated. The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be admi nistered at the same visit as serologic testing. Draw the blood before administering vaccine. After the results of the serologic tests are received and the client is found to be suscept ible, the second and third doses should be administered according to the client's age as specified in the ACIP recommended schedule. Prevaccination Serology for Hepatitis A: Prevaccination serology for hepatitis A is not indicated for routine vaccination of children and adults. Antibody production in response to H AV infection results in lifelong immunity to hepatitis A infection. Vaccination of persons who are immune because of prior infection does not increase the risk for adverse events. In populations that have expected high rates of prior HAV infection, prevaccination testing may be considered to reduce costs by not vaccinating persons who hav e prior immunity. Testing of children is not indicated because of their expected low pr evalence of infection. For adults, the decision to test should be based upon the following information: a) the expected prevalence of immunity; b) the cost of vaccination compared with the cost of se rologic testing (including the cost of an additional visit); and c) the likelihood that te sting will not interfere wit h initiating vaccination. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012 State Hepatitis Program 3 State He patitis Pro gram Persons for whom prevaccination testing will likely be most cost-effective include: \u0083 Adults who were either born in or lived for extensive periods in geographic areas that have a high endemicity of HAV infection; \u0083 Older adolescents and adults in certai n population groups (i.e., American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Hispanics); \u0083 Adults in certain groups that have a high prevalence of infection (e.g., injecting drug users). Post-vaccination serology for Hepatitis B Testing for immunity to hepatitis B follo wing vaccination is not routinely recommended but should be considered for persons w hose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status . This would include: \u0084 Infants born to HBsAg-positive women \u0084 Dialysis patients, persons with weak ened immune systems and health care workers who have direct contac t with blood or body fluids When indicated, post-vaccination testing for children and adults should be done 1 to 2 months after completion of the vaccine seri es to provide definitive information on response to the vaccine. Infants born to HB sAg-positive women should be tested 3 to 9 months after the third dos e of hepatitis B vaccine. Post-vaccination serology for Hepatitis A Post-vaccination serology is not indicated in persons receiving hep atitis A vaccine due to the high rate of response among childr en and adults. No test sensitive enough to detect low anti-HAV concentrations is approved for routine diagnostic use in the United States.

Hepatitis - 2/2012- Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 1Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HI V and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Background The goal of hepatitis B immunization is to prevent transmission of chronic HBV infection, which in turn prevents chronic liver disease and liver c ancer. While routine vaccination of infants in the United States will eventually produce a population highly immune to hepatitis B, further efforts must be extended to prevent transmission among groups at highest risk for infection (see list below). Healthy People 2020 goals state that \"viral hepatitis can be prevented, yet health care systems often do not make the best use of their available resources to support prevention efforts.\" To reach the Healthy People 2020 target for adults (1.5 cases per 100,000), hepatitis B vaccination programs must continue to focus on susceptible persons at the highest risk of infection. In 2010, there were 1.6 cases per 100,000 reported in Georgia, with individual county rates ranging from 0.7 to 16.1 cases per 100,000 population. Of the data collected on risk factors, the majority of newly acquired cases of hepatitis B are associated with high-risk sexual activity or injection-drug use. It is impor tant to provide prevention and healthy lifestyles information. This includes advancing effect ive and evidence-based viral hepatitis prevention priorities and interventions. Vaccinating susceptible persons attending public Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD), HIV, and Family Planning clinics in Georgia will reduce the transmission of HBV to sexually active adole scents and adults. Measures should be taken at the district and county levels to avoid missed opportunities to vaccinate high-risk patients, especially those referred by Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Managers and other Public Health staff. High-risk Groups for whom Hepatitis B Vaccination is Recommended 1. Persons with occupational risk. Any healthcare or public-safety worker may be at risk for HBV exposure, depending on the tasks performed. Workers who perform tasks involving contact with blood or blood-contaminated body fluid should be vaccinated. For persons in health-care fields, vaccination should be completed during training in schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health professions, before trainees have their first contact with blood. 2. Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled. Susceptible clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled, as well as staff who work closely with clients, should be vaccinated. Susceptible clients and staff who live or work in smaller residential settings with known H BV carriers should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. Clients discharged from residentia l institutions into community programs should be screened for HBsAg so that appropriate measures can be taken to prevent HBV transmission. These measures should include both environmental controls and appropriate use of vaccine. Staff of nonresidential day-care programs for the developmentally disabled (e.g., schools, sheltered workshops) attended by known HBV carriers have a risk of infection comparable with that of health-care workers and therefore should be vaccinated. The risk of infection for other clients appears to be lower than the risk for staff. Vaccination of clients in day care programs may be considered. Vaccination of classroom contacts is strongly encouraged if a classmate who is an HBV carrier behaves aggressively or has special medical problems (e.g., exudative derma titis, open skin lesions) that increase the risk of exposure to his or her blood or serous secretions. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012- Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 2Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HI V and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health 3. Hemodialysis patients. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible hemodialysis patients. Vaccinating patients early in the course of their renal disease is encouraged because patients with uremia who are vaccinated before they require dialysis are more likely to respond to the vaccine. Although their seroconversion rates and anti-HBs titers are lower than those of healthy persons, patients who respond to vaccination will be protected from infection, and the need for frequent serologic testing will be reduced. 4. Recipients of certain blood products. Patients who receive clotting-factor concentrates have an increased risk of HBV infection and should be vaccinated as soon as their specific clotting disorder is identified. Prevaccination testing is recommended for patients who have already received multiple infusions of these products. 5. Household contacts and sex partners of HBV carriers. All household and sexual contacts of persons identified as HBsAg positive should be vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at the age-appropriate dose to those determined to be susceptible or judged likely to be susceptible to infection. 6. Adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic. Adopted or fostered orphans or unaccompanied minors from countries where HBV infection is endemic should be screened for HBsAg. If the children are HBsAg positive, other family members should be vaccinated. 7. International travelers. Vaccination should be considered for persons who plan to spend more than 6 months in areas with high rates of HBV infection and who will have close contact with the local population. Short-term travelers who are likely to have contact with blood (e.g., in a medical setting) or sexual contact with residents of areas with high or intermediate levels of endemic disease should be vaccinated. Vaccination should begin at least 6 months before travel to allow for completion of the full vaccine series, although a partial series will offer some protection. The alternate four-dose schedule should provide protection if the first three doses can be delivered before departure. 8. Injecting drug users (IDU). All injecting drug users who are susceptible to HBV should be vaccinated as soon as their drug use begins. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population, prevaccination screening should be considered. 9. Men who have sex with men (MSM). Susceptible MSM should be vaccinated. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population, prevaccination screening should be considered. Men known to have HIV infection should be tested for anti-HBs response after completion of the vaccine series. 10. Sexually active heterosexual men and women. Vaccination is recommended for men and women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually transmitted diseases, for prostitutes, and for persons who ha ve a history of sexual activity with more than one partner in the previous 6 months. Mo st patients seen in clinics for sexually transmitted diseases should be considered candidates for vaccination. 11. Inmates of long-term correctional facilities . Prison officials should consider undertaking screening and vaccination programs directed at inmates with histories of high-risk behaviors. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012- Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 3Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HI V and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Eligibility for Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD/HIV and Family Planning Clinics in Georgia The following persons ARE ELIGIBLE to receive state-supplied hepatitis B vaccine if screened in any Public Health clinic and are Medicare covered, Medicaid covered, underinsured, or uninsured: 1. Men having sex with men (MSM) 2. Injecting drug users (IDU) 3. Individuals with multiple sex partners (more than 1 partner in the past six months) 4. Homeless Adults 5. Persons seeking STD/HIV screening services including HIV testing and counseling 6. HIV infected persons 7. Persons recently diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) 8. Persons seeking Family Planning clinic services 9. Sexual partners of persons with acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection 10. Household contacts of persons with acute or chronic HBV infection 11. Hemodialysis and transplant patients 12. Persons who began the series using state-supplied vaccine and still need to complete the series, regardless of insurance status 13. Refugees > 19 years of age 14. Diabetics (Type 1 or Type 2) Persons NOT ELIGIBLE to receive state-supplied hepatitis B vaccine for routine immunizations include: 1. Public safety workers 2. Health care workers 3. International travelers 4. Inmates 5. Staff of institutions for developmentally disabled Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B with Vaccine and HBIG Recommendations on postexposure prophylaxis are based on available efficacy data and on the likelihood of future HBV exposure of the person requiring treatment. In all exposures, a regimen combining HBIG with hepatitis B vaccine will provide both short- and long-term protection and is the treatment of choice. Please refer to Chapter 2, \"Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Adult Populations (age 19 years)\" in this manual for the eligibility requirements for persons to receive state-supplied HBIG. Immunization Consent Requirements Vaccination against viral hepatitis for persons under the age of 18 years without parental/guardian consent can occur in conjunction with STD/HIV examinations due to already existing laws and legal precedent relating to STD/HIV examination and treatment of minors (O.C.G.A. 31-17-7). In these instances, a minor is considered to be receiving hepatitis B vaccine as prophylaxis for STD, and therefore is covered under the aforementioned section of the Official Code of Georgia. Conversely, persons less than 18 years of age cannot be vaccinated without parental/guardian consent in any other vaccination setting, including school vaccination programs, outbreak control settings where mass vaccinations are being given, and other clinic settings where STD/HIV evaluations and treatments are not conducted. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012- Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 4Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HI V and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Serology Testing Prevaccination serologic testing for susceptibility Pre-vaccination serology is cost effective and should be considered in persons who are at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Due to higher seroprevalence, the following high-risk groups should receive pre-vaccination testing: 1. Men having sex with men (MSM) 2. Intravenous drug users (IDU) 3. Sexual/household contacts of persons infected with HBV Prevaccination testing should not interfere with administering vaccine during the visit for which immunization against hepatitis B is requested. To test high-risk patients for history of disease and the need for vaccine, order HBsAg and anti-HBs tests. Draw the blood before administering vaccine. The first dose of vaccine should be given at the same visit as the blood test. If the client is found susceptible to HBV (via negative serology), then doses 2 and 3 should be administered at the appropriate intervals. It is not cost-effective for groups with a low expected prevalence of HBV serologic markers, to receive prevaccination testing. Therefore, pre-vaccination serologies are not indicated before routine vaccination of infants, children and adults. The Georgia Public Health Laboratory hepatitis serology consists of HBsAg, total anti-HBc, HBeAg, and anti-HBs. Specific guidelines for ordering hepatitis B serologies can be found in the Georgia Public Health Laboratory Service Manua l in the \"Microbial Immunology Laboratory, Infectious Disease Serology section.\" (See Appendi x to this chapter.) For additional information regarding the interpretation of hepatitis B serologies, please see Appendix H4 of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines. Postvaccination Testing Hepatitis B vaccine, when given at the correct anatomic site produces protective antibody (anti- HBs) in greater than 90% of healthy persons. Testing for immunity after vaccination is not recommended routinely but is advised for persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status (such as dialysis patients, other immunocompromised patients, and health care workers with direct contact to blood and body fluids). Testing for immunity is also advised for persons for whom a suboptimal response may be anticipated, such as those who have received vaccine in the buttock, persons greater than or equal to 50 years of age, and persons known to have HIV infection. Post-vaccination testing should also be considered for persons at occupational risk who may have needle-stick exposures necessitating postexposure prophylaxis. When indicated, post-vaccination testing should be done between 1-3 months after completion of the vaccine series to provide definit ive information on response to the vaccine. Note: The post-vaccination serology recommendation for infants born to HBsAg- positive women is 3-9 months after the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who do not respond to the first series of hepatitis B vaccine should complete a second three-dose series. Revaccination of persons who do not respond to the primary series produces adequate antibody in 15%-25% after one additional dose and in 30%-50% after three additional doses when the primary vaccination has been given in the deltoid. For persons who did not respond to a primary vaccine series given in the buttock, data suggest that revaccination in the arm induces adequate antibody in greater than 75%. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2012- Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 5Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HI V and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Sexual Partners of Persons with Acute HBV Infection Sexual partners of HBsAg-positive persons are at increased risk of acquiring HBV infection, and HBIG has been shown to be 75% effective in preventing such infections. Data about the efficacy of HBIG beyond the 14-day cutoff is limited and the period after sexual exposure during which HBIG is effective is unknown; however, it is unlikely that this period would exceed 14 days. Testing of sexual partners for susceptibility is recommended at the same visit as the first dose of vaccine. If a sexual partner is found susceptible after serology, then administer doses 2 and 3 at the appropriate dosage and time intervals. Household Contacts of Persons with Acute HBV Infection Since infants have close contact with primary care givers and they have a higher risk of becoming HBV carriers after acute HBV infection, prophylaxis of an infant less than 12 months of age with HBIG (0.5 mL) and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated if the mother or primary care giver has acute HBV infection. Prophylaxis with HBIG for other household contacts of persons with acute HBV infection is not indicated unless they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes or razors, within the past 7 days. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for household contacts and the first dose should be administered at the same visit as the prevaccination serology. Be sure to draw blood for the serology before administering the vaccine. If the household contact is found susceptible after serology, then administer doses 2 and 3 at the appropriate dosage and time intervals. Such exposures should be treated similarly to sexual exposures. If the index patient becomes an HBV carrier, all household contacts should be given hepatitis B vaccine. NOTE : Administering even one dose of hepatitis B vaccine allows seroconversion for 40% to 50% of persons receiving vaccine. Always encourage clients to complete the series, but do not withhold vaccine if uncertain that the client will return for the subsequent doses. General Hepatitis B Vaccination Requirements Please see Chapter 2, \"Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis B\", for specific vaccine administration guidelines. Reporting Requirements All Georgia physicians, laboratories, and other health care providers are required by the authority of the Official Code of Georgia (Sections 31-12-2 and 31-22-7, Rules of the Department of Human Resources, chapter 290-5-3.02) to report persons with acute hepatitis B disease or persons who are HBsAg positive within 7 days to their County Health Department or District Health Office. Hepatitis B cases may also be reported to the Epidemiology Section. The preferred method of reporting is through the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SENDSS), available at http://sendss.state.ga.us/ . In addition, positive serologies and acute cases received by the County Health Department or Health District are to be reported via SENDSS. Hepatitis B Counseling Interview Each person infected with HBV should be counseled regarding the infection and interviewed for household and sexual contacts. For more specific information, please refer to \"Example Interviewing/Counseling Format (for) Hepatitis B,\" found in the Appendix section of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines in this chapter.

Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2012 Distribution Of Vaccines 1 1. The State Immunization Office will utilize compr ehensive reports, submitted by individual clinics each month to evaluate current vaccine inventory and historical usage. Shipments of vaccines, sufficient to bring vaccine inventories to the level of a three-month supply, will be made if vaccine is available. 2. Comprehensive reports are to be submitted monthly via GRITS. 3. All vaccine shipments will be sent directly to Clinic/County offices. 4. Short dated vaccines MUST be reported a minimum of 90 days before the date of expiration to the State Immunization Office, via phone (404) 657-5013 or e-mail: crrobinson@dhr.state.ga.us . The GRITS pre-populated report form will not generate this information for you. 5. State supplied vaccines lost due to expiration or spoilage must be returned to McKesson. Instructions are available on the GRITS home page under the \"Additional Resources\" section. 6. When vaccine shortages occur nationally, it may be necessary to move vaccine within the district. It also may be necessary to move vaccine from one district to another. It is the responsibility of the Immunization Office to evaluate total state needs and authorize movement of vaccine when necessary. 7. Details of all vaccine transfers must be reported to the state office via email at gavfc@dhr.state.ga.us and crrobinson@dhr.state.ga.us . The following information must be included in the email: date of transfer, GIP ID numbers for sending and receiving sites, vaccine name, lot number, expiration date, and number of doses. Each facility that stores vaccine must have AST or NIST certified thermometers in both the refrigerator section and in the freezer section of the unit used for vaccine storage. Temperature readings must be taken and recorded twice daily; once in the morning and once in the evening (see sample temperature log). If temperatures fall outside the acceptable range, the cause must be determined and corrected immediately. Failure to have thermometers and to record temperatures will jeopardize your status to receive vaccine and may result in counties/dist ricts having to purchase replacement vaccine. Each facility that stores vaccine must have adequate storage to assure vaccine integrity. Dormitory type refrigerators are not acceptable. Routinely placing va ccine in portable coolers during the clinic day is also unacceptable. Refrigerators must have externally separate sealed doors for the refrigerator and freezer compartments. Dual thermostats/temperature controls for each compartment are also strongly required. An emergency plan must be developed by each facility for handling vaccine storage in the event of a power outage. This plan must be reviewed and updated annua lly, at minimum, to determine if all parties listed in the plan are aware of their responsibilities (see sample \"Routine and Emergency Vaccine Handling Plans\" form). Providers are encouraged to visit the CDC's storage and handling toolkit for additional resources at http://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/shtoolkit/ DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINESDocument temperatures twice daily, and keep temp logs on file for at least 3 years!

Page 1 of 6 PH Provider Agreement Revised 02/20/2013 State of Georgia Immunization Office Georgia Department of Public Health Public Health Provider Agreement This document is the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH), Division of Health Protection, Immunization Office (GIO) policy for program compliance. Noncompliance is de fined as any intentional deviation from the signed Provider Agreement with GIO. Each enrolled County Nurse Manager must sign a Provider Agreement stating that he/she agrees to the following conditions: 1. I agree that vaccine supplied by GIO will be administered only to Vaccines for Children (VFC)-eligible children 18 years of age who meet one of the following 4 eligibility criteria: a) Is covered by Medicaid (or qualifies through a Medicaid waiver). b) Has no health insurance (uninsured). c) Is American Indian or an Alaska Native. d) Has health insurance that does not pay for the vaccine (underinsured) seen in a FQHC/RHC or deputized clinical settings. Definitions for VFC eligible children: a) Medicaid - has a current Medicaid card or Medicaid waiver at the time of service. b) Uninsured - has no health insurance. c) American Indian/Alaska Native - self-reported by the patient. d) Underinsured - has insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit. Example: An insurance company may not cover certain immunizations, such as the Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine. The child will qualify for VFC for those particular vaccines. Example: An insurance company may cover immunizations up to a certain age. Until that age, the child is fully insured. After that age, the child is considered underinsured (has insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit) and is then e ligible to receive VFC vaccines. Example: An insurance company may only provide $ 100.00 per year to cover the costs of immunizations. The child is fully insured up to $100. 00. Once this amount is exhausted, th e child is then eligible to receive VFC vaccines. Program Violations (examples should not be considered all-inclusive) a) A provider administers VFC supplied vaccine, then bills the recipient's insurance for the cost of the vaccine. b) A provider charges a patient who is eligible for VFC supplied vaccine for the cost of the vaccine. c) A provider charges a Medicaid recipient any fee at all. d) A provider fails to purchase private stock vaccine for patie nts who are ineligible for state supplied vaccine, and gives a patient VFC supplied vaccine, whether they are eligible or not. e) A provider administers VFC supplied vaccine to a child who has private insurance with a high deductible. Example: Parent has a policy with a $1,000.00 deductib le. The child is still considered fully insured and privately purchased vaccine should be administered. f) A provider 'borrows' VFC vaccine to administer to a privately insured patient. Providers are required to purchase vaccine for non VFC-eligible patients. Actions a) Educational training and follow-up vi sits will be conducted by an Imm unization Program Consultant (IPC). Page 2 of 6 PH Provider Agreement Revised 02/20/2013 b) Vaccine shipments will be suspended until VFC su pplied vaccine is replaced by the provider. See Appendix A, Georgia Immunization Office Vaccine Loss Policy . c) Program violations will result in a provider's ineligibility to receive VFC supplied vaccines. 2. I agree that vaccine supplied by GIO will be provide d to the following non-VFC eligible categories. Immunization Office (GIO) supplies vaccines to the following special populations : a) PeachCare kids with coverage provided by Amerigroup, WellCare, and Peach State. b) Patients deemed otherwise eligible for state supplied va ccine in public health departments as defined in the current eligibility criteria table. c) Has health insurance that does not pay for the vacci ne (underinsured) seen in non FQHC/RHC and non- deputized clinical settings. Program Violations (examples should not be considered all-inclusive) a) A provider administers state supplied vaccine, then bills the recipient's insurance fo r the cost of the vaccine. b) A provider charges patients who are eligible for state supplied vaccine for the cost of the vaccine. c) A provider fails to purchase private stock vaccine for patie nts who are ineligible for state supplied vaccine, and gives a patient seen in the clinic state-supplied vaccine, whether they are eligible or not. d) A provider administers state supplied vaccine to a patient who has private insurance with a high deductible. Example: Parent has a policy with a $1,000.00 deductib le. The child is still considered fully insured and privately purchased vaccine should be administered. e) A provider 'borrows' state vaccine to administer to a privately insured patient. Providers are required to purchase vaccine for non state-eligible patients. Actions a) Educational training and follow-up vi sits will be conducted by an Imm unization Program Consultant (IPC). b) Vaccine shipments will be suspended until state s upplied vaccine is replaced by the provider. See Appendix A, Georgia Immunization Office Vaccine Loss Policy . c) Program violations will result in a provider's suspension of vaccine shipments from GIO. 3. The following applies to FQHC/RHC Deputized Providers only: a) Agree to vaccinate \"walk-in\" ed children as defined under s ubsection 1928(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act;. b) Screen for VFC eligibility, including for underinsured status , at every visit by any child less than 19 years of age; c) Report to GIO, in manner and time as decided by GIO, all requirements set forth in the guidance; and d) Comply with any additional VFC requirements as GIO or CDC may from time to time impose. 4.

Program Violations a) Inappropriate administration of vaccine. Example: Mixing two vaccines in the same syringe (e.g., MMR and DTaP) for the purpose of reducing the number of injections needed. Example: Administering pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to a 12 year old, when VFC guidelines allow for administration to children less than 5 years of age. b) Non-compliance with ACIP recommendations for age and dose intervals. Example: Administering vaccines before the proper age (e.g., vaccinating a child with MMR and Varicella vaccine before the age of one year). c) Provider fails to assess for immunization status and immunize children at the time they are seen. Example: Provider sees child for well-child visits but does not review immunization status and/or simply refers child to another facility for immunizations. Example: Provider sees child for sick visit but does not review immunization status to be administered once child is well. Actions a) Mandatory participation in educati onal training provided by an IPC. b) Program violations may result in suspension of vaccine shipments from GIO. 7.

Name (Please print or type) Title Signature Date Enrollment cannot be processed without completion of the signature page Page 1 of 4 GA VFC Accountability Policy Created 1/11/2012 State of Georgia Immunization Office Georgia Department of Public Health Georgia Immunization Office Vaccine Accountability Policy This document will serve as the Georgia Department of Public Health, Immunization Office Vaccine Accountability Policy. This policy is designed to ensure: 1. Vaccine purchased with Vaccines for Children (VFC), fe deral and state funds are administered only to VFC- eligible and state-eligible recipients; 2. Vaccine loss and waste are minimized and measured; 3. The Georgia Immunization and VFC Programs are protected against fraud and abuse; 4. State, VFC and other federally purchased vaccines are orde red appropriately based on a provider's VFC-eligible and state-eligible populations. The increase in the number of ACIP recommended vaccines and a rise in their associated costs has prompted a renewed emphasis on program accountability at all levels. As part of the enrollment and annual recertification processes for VFC and state vaccine programs, providers agree to comply w ith VFC and Georgia Immunization Office (GIO) requirements for ordering, storage, handling and account ability of vaccine to avoid vaccine loss as outlined in the Georgia Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A). Providers also agree to operate in a manner intended to avoid vaccine fraud and abuse as outlined in the Georgia Vaccine Fraud and Abuse policy (Appendix B). Georgia will help ensure vaccine accountability in provider offices by: 1. Using provider profiles to monitor provider orders; 2. Monitoring provider vaccine inventory levels to ensure adequate supplies of public and privately purchased vaccine for the population size served in provider offices; 3. Monitoring vaccine wastage and loss that occur in provider offices; 4. Monitoring provider activities to prevent and/or iden tify fraud and abuse against the VFC and state vaccine programs. 5. Providing clear guidance to providers regarding the retu rn of expired and wasted public vaccine for excise tax credit. Using Provider Profiles to Monitor Provider Orders VFC Providers are required to submit supporting documen ts for the enrollment estimates produced during VFC enrollment, re-enrollment, or annual re- certification with the VFC Program. Documentation is required to verify that submitted estimates are based on the previous year's: 1. Doses administered, benchmarking, Medi caid and/or other billing data; or 2. IIS (GRITS) data. The VFC Logistics Associate will review a random provider sample on a monthly basis for accountability review purposes. Doses administered data will be reviewed over a 6 month span and data will be compared to the providers submitted profile estimates. Aggregate vaccine data exceeding an nual profile estimates identified during this will result in corrective action development and implementation as necess ary, including vaccine replacement for unaccounted for doses. Page 2 of 4 GA VFC Accountability Policy Created 1/11/2012 1. GIO staff contact providers that exceed profile amounts to determine if distribution of additional vaccine is justified, or if adjustments to the profile are needed. 2. Future vaccine orders are adjusted appropriately to ensu re providers receive sufficient supply to serve their VFC or State-eligible population without creating an in crease risk for vaccine loss, fraud, and/or abuse. VFC providers who submit their Monthly Comprehensive Report\" through GRITS are also required to manage their inventory and doses administered data in GRITS. Effective January 1, 2012: 1. Newly enrolled VFC providers are required to report via GRITS. 2. All currently enrolled active VFC providers must tran sition to 100% GRITS reporting by October 31, 2012. VFC staff, the GRITS Help Desk, and the IPC staff will be ava ilable to assist with the transition to total GRITS reporting. This requirement in preparation for VT rckS implementation will assist with accountability of doses as the monthly report generates a monthly statement of vaccine acc ountability and replacement cost when necessary. Monitoring of Provider Inventory Le vels (Public vs. Private Supply) In order to receive vaccine from Georgia's VFC program, VFC-enrolled providers must comply with reporting requirements for vaccine usage including: doses administered by eligibility categor y, wastage, and inventory. Georgia uses the following methods as ways to monitor provider invent ory levels for both public and private vaccine supply: 1. VFC Program Representatives have been trained to routin ely review monthly comprehe nsive reports for excessive use, underreporting, over reporting and anything that may look out of the ordinary. 2. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provider(s) and unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will respond accordingly. Monitoring Vaccine Wastage and Loss The Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Office Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A) details the action taken by the Georgia VFC Program for identifying, monitoring a nd management of incidents that result in loss of public vaccine. The action taken by the Georgia VFC Program will de pend on the category of the vaccine loss. For this policy, lost vaccines fall under three categories: 1) negligence , 2) non-preventable loss, and 3) noncompliance. VFC staff use the CDC Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirement Protocol (algorithm) to address all vaccine loss policy violations. Continued violation of any section of th is policy will result in termination from the VFC Program. Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Abuse in Provider Offices The Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Office Fraud and Abuse Policy (Appendix B) details the action taken by the Georgia VFC Program to provide programmatic direction for the prevention of fraud and abuse in the utilization of state-supplied and/or VFC-funded vaccine. The Fraud and Abuse Policy is revi ewed annually and updated, as necessary. Training on fraud and abuse takes place as part of new employee orientation. Additionally, program staff (VFC staff and Immunization Program Consultants [IPCs]) receives annual educational updates, led by the Deputy Director . Georgia uses the following methods as ways to detect a nd/or prevent fraud and abuse of public vaccine supply: 1. Upon enrollment and on a monthly basis thereafter, provide r information is cross-checked against the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the Department of H ealth and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General website. If located in the Exclusion database, providers are not allowed to participate in VFC. 2. VFC Program staff has been trained to routinely revi ew monthly comprehensive reports for excessive use, underreporting, and anything that may look out of the ordinary. 3. Georgia Immunization Representatives are required to review with the provider a vaccine accountability statement representative of at least six (6) months, which can help identify areas of pot ential fraud and/or abuse. 4. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provider, and unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will respond accordingly. Page 3 of 4 GA VFC Accountability Policy Created 1/11/2012 5. Any individual, group, or practice who wants to report a suspected case of fraud and/or abuse, a dedicated Fraud and Abuse Hotline has been implemented and is monitore d by the Deputy Director. The Fraud and Abuse hotline number is (404) 657-5950. Reports must include (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Source of the allegation; 3. Source's name, address, and telephone number (if available) 4. A description of the reason for the report (suspected misconduct/violation) 5. Specific VFC requirements violated; 6. Value of vaccine involved (if available); 7. If the report was initiated in response to a complaint, a copy and/or summary of the complaint and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 8. Success of educational intervention; and 9. A summary of the result of any preliminary investiga tion conducted by GIO staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. Once a report is received, the Non-compliance with VFC Provide r Requirements Protocol will be used to determine the appropriate follow up action. At the GIO, the Deputy Director is the person with primar y responsibility for responding to suspected fraud and/or abuse. The Deputy Director will have authority to make decisions, refe rrals, and notifications when a ppropriate. In the event that the Deputy Director is not available, the VFC Coordinator w ill assume responsibility. In the event that neither of these individuals is available, the Program Director will assume responsibility. The Deputy Director (or designated respondent) will review all in formation submitted and initiate an internal investigation on all cases reported without sufficient evidence of fraud and abuse w ithin five days of the report. All suspected cases of VFC fraud and abuse will be forwarded electronically to th e Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office and CDC within ten (10) business days following disposition. MIG will conduct preliminary investigations and, as warranted, transmit the re ferral to the appropriate oversight entity and will monitor the handling of the referral by entity. Process for Returning Expired and/or Wasted Public Vaccine All vaccine received from the GIO must always be accounted for. This includes doses administered and inventory as well as wasted and expired vaccine. Providers are required to report doses wasted or expired on the Federal Return of Vaccine Form which begins the processing of their return request a nd our excise tax credit process. Vaccine returns are approved by the Vaccine Logistics Associate. The Vaccine Logis tics Associate submits requests to McKesson monthly for UPS return labels. Once returns are appr oved and McKesson has received the label request from VFC, McKesson will ship UPS return label(s) directly to the provider site. Providers are asked to box returns properly to ensure safe tr ansit of the vials. Providers submit return request every quarterly or bi-annually unless a vaccine incident or temper ature excursion requires an immediate return. The Vaccine Logistics Associate processes and screens each return to ensure returned vaccines have been accounted for in our Vaccine Loss Database and determine if replacement of the loss v accine(s) are required according to Georgia's Vaccine Loss Policy. Providers are reminded to mark expired or wasted vaccine(s) \"DO NOT USE\" and store it securely and outside of the refrigerator to avoid accidental administration of non-viable vaccine. Vaccine return boxes should include: 1. At least one full shipping box of vaccines (use McKesson shipping boxes as a size gauge) 2. Full vials of unused vaccine 3. Appropriate padding to protect vials from breaking 4. Federal Return Form (copy faxed to the VFC office) Page 4 of 4 GA VFC Accountability Policy Created 1/11/2012 Vaccine return boxes should not include: 1. Needles or syringes with needles (vac cine that has been drawn into a sy ringe should be wasted on-site, not returned.) 2. Broken or partially used vials (including partially used multi-dose vials) 3. Paperwork or other re ports intended for VFC 4. Any other objects Deputy Director will review CDC distributed Quarterly Vacci ne Monitoring Reports to determine the amount of excise tax credit allocated to Georgia for return ed vaccines. Excise tax credit is used to purchase vaccines in order to replenish or stock state/local vaccine supply for Georgia at McKesson. Page 1 of 5 GIO Vaccine Loss Policy Rev. 4/11/2012 State of Georgia Immunization Office Georgia Department of Public Health Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A) This document will serve as the Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Office's policy for management of incidents that result in loss of state supplied vaccines. The action taken by the Georgia VFC Program will depend on the category of the vaccine loss. For this policy, lost vaccines fall under three categories: 1) negligence, 2) non-preventable loss, and 3) noncompliance. Category 1 Vaccine loss due to negligence is defined as, but not limited to, the following: a) Vaccines stored improperly (i.e., refrigerating vaccine that should have been frozen, freezing vaccine that should have been refrigerated, or storing any vaccine in a dormitory style refrigerator even for day use). b) Vaccines left out of refrigerator or freezer. c) Refrigerator or freezer unplugged. d) Door of refrigerator or freezer left ajar resu lting in unit temperatures outside the acceptable range. e) Improper maintenance of recommended refrigerator and freezer temperatures resulting in vaccine spoilage, including prolonged storage of vaccines when out of range temperatures are recorded. (Note: Temperatures recorded on temperature logs will be considered official in making vaccine viability decisions. Also, a thermometer's margin of error will not be considered when temperatures are recorded at or below 35\u00b0F/2\u00b0C.) f) Pre-drawing or premixing vaccine, then not administering. g) Discarding vaccine prior to the manufacturer's stated expiration date (e.g., discarding vaccine in a multi-dose vial 30 days after the vial is first used). h) Transporting/shipping vaccine with lack of or inappropriate coolants (e.g., packing refrigerated vaccines with dry ice or frozen vaccines with ice packs only). i) Failure to notify the VFC Program when provider office hours change or the practice moves, resulting in vaccines being undeliverable and consequently spoiled. j) Failure to notify the VFC Program Vaccine expired due to failure of the provider to notify the VFC Program three months prior to expiration date so that vaccine might be transferred. Action Plan If the provider discovers: vaccine not refrigerated or frozen within the recommended temperature range, vaccine left outside the refrigerator or freezer, the refrigerator or freezer door left ajar, continued documentation of temperatures outside the recommended range, vaccine lost in transit to a satellite facility, or vaccine undeliverable and spoiled due to a change in office hours, the incident must be reported to VFC immediately. Vaccines should be kept in the appropriate stor age environment (refrigerator or freezer) until a decision is made concerning their viability. Page 2 of 5 GIO Vaccine Loss Policy Rev. 4/11/2012 Call 404-657-5013 and explain the circumstances to the Vaccine Logistics Associate. The Vaccine Logistics Associate will send the provider a copy of the Vaccine Incident Report form to complete and return for further review of the incident. Be prepared to furnish the following information: a) Last known temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; b) Current temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; c) Duration of time the vaccines were stored out of recommended temperature range; and d) Lot numbers, expiration dates, and number of doses of all vaccines in question. Upon receipt of the Vaccine Incident Report, the Vaccine Logistics Associate will contact the vaccine manufacturers and determine if the vaccines in question are salvageable. If they are not, the provider may be required to purchase replacement vaccines. This decision will be made by the Vaccine Logistics Associate and the Deputy Director based on past vaccine loss history and the number of vaccine doses lost. The provider will be required to replace VFC vaccine losses due to negligence when those losses are valued at more than 5 percent of the number of doses of VFC vaccines available to be administered by the provider in the past 12 months. For example, VFC MMR shipped to a provider in the past 12 months totals 1,000 doses. A vaccine loss of 75 doses of MMR occurs. A 5% loss would equal 50 doses. In this case, the provider would be required to purchase and replace 25 doses of MMR to be administered to VFC-eligible children. When replacement of lost vaccine is required: a) The provider must mail or fax invoices for replacement vaccine to the VFC Program within 10 business days; b) The assigned Immunization Program Consultant (IPC) will verify, by site visit, the replacement of the lost vaccines within 30 days of the incident; and c) The provider will submit a description of the incident in writing within 10 business days that discusses the circumstances of the loss and the steps taken to ensure that vaccine is protected in the future. When replacement of vaccine is not required: a) The provider will submit a letter describing the incident within 10 business days that discusses the circumstances of the loss and the steps taken to ensure that vaccine is protected in the future; and b) Vaccine shipments will be resumed upon receipt of the aforementioned letter. Any vaccine that is deemed not usable due to negligent circumstances should be returned to McKesson using the VFC-issued McKesson Return of Federal Vaccine Form. For more information, please call 404-657-5013. Information and instructions on returning wasted/expired vaccine (as well as the return form) can be found via the web at http://health.state.ga.us/programs/immunization/vfc/ , or on the GRITS home page in the 'Resources' section. Category 2 Vaccine loss due to non-preventable circumstances, such as: a) Area power outages due to severe weather or other unavoidable and unanticipated causes. b) Refrigerator failure. c) Transport company error (i.e., FedEx or Drug Transport, Inc.) Failure of the provider to notify VFC of a change in office hours or address will not be considered a transport company error. Page 3 of 5 GIO Vaccine Loss Policy Rev. 4/11/2012 Action Plan If the provider discovers a power outage has occurred or the refrigerator storing vaccines has malfunctioned, the VFC program should be notified immediately by calling 404-657-5013. Vaccines should be kept in the appropriate storage environment (refrigerator or freezer) until a decision is made concerning their viability (provider should enact their Vaccine Disaster Recovery Plan immediately if necessary). The Vaccine Logistics Associate will send the provider a copy of the Vaccine Incident Report form to complete and return for further review of the incident. The provider should be prepared to supply the following information to the Vaccine Logistics Associate: a) Last known temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; b) Current temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; c) Duration of time the vaccines were stored out of recommended temperature range; and d) Lot numbers, expiration dates, and number of doses of all vaccines in question. Upon receipt of the Vaccine Incident Report, the Vaccine Logistics Associate will contact the vaccine manufacturers and determine the status of the vaccines. If the vaccines are determined to be viable, but the power to the office has not been restored or the refrigerator is still in disrepair, vaccines must be transported immediately to an alternate refrigerator/freezer and steps followed as noted in the provider's Vaccine Disaster Recovery Plan. If no plan is in place, the Vaccine Logistics Associate will assist the provider in determining a plan of action. Providers without a Vaccine Disaster Recovery Plan will be required to develop and submit a copy of their Vaccine Disaster Recovery Plan within 10 business days to prevent interruption in shipment of public vaccine supply from VFC. Any vaccine that is deemed not usable due to negligent circumstances should be returned to McKesson using the VFC-issued McKesson Return of Federal Vaccine Form. For more information, please call 404-657-5013. Information and instructions on returning wasted/expired vaccine (as well as the return form) can be found via the web at http://health.state.ga.us/programs/immunization/vfc/ or on the GRITS home page in the 'Resources' section. As soon as power is restored or a replacement re frigerator is acquired, the provider should: a) Monitor and document temperatures of the refrigerator and freezer for 5 days. b) The assigned IPC will verify, by site visit, that the storage unit is functioning properly and is adequate in size to accommodate safe storage of public supply wi thin 10 days following provider's notification that the above step has been completed. c) If adequate temperatures are maintained, replacem ent vaccines will be shipped to the provider from VFC. Category 3 Vaccine loss due to noncompliance with VFC written policies, such as: a) VFC vaccine not accounted for by monthly usage and inventory reports. This can be reflected by usage data or inventory discrepancies that reflect lost vaccine supply. Examples include the following: Failure to document doses administered on usage log; Failure to document patient eligibility on usage log; Failure to report inventory; Inaccurate reporting of inventory; Failure to report expired/wasted vaccine; or Failure to report short dated vaccines 90 days prior to expiration Page 4 of 5 GIO Vaccine Loss Policy Rev. 4/11/2012 b) VFC vaccine knowingly administered to children who are not eligible for the VFC program, including the following: Administration of VFC vaccine to patients who are over 18 years of age; Administration of VFC to every patient in the practice whether eligible or not (i.e., a provider discontinues purchasing private stocks of vaccine for administration to patients whose insurance covers immunizations or to patients who can afford vaccine); Administration of VFC vaccine because the reimbursement rate of the child's insurance company is low; Administration of VFC vaccine to a child who is fully insured (has insurance and vaccines are a covered benefit), including administration of VFC vaccine to a child who has not met their deductible in order to save the parent the cost of the deductible (a child is considered fully insured until the deductible has been met); or Administration of VFC vaccine to a child even though the insurance company provides a flat rate of coverage for immunization for the year (upon exhaustion of flat rate coverage, the child is then eligible for VFC vaccine). Failure to maintain separate inventories for VFC, Adult (state supplied if applicable), and privately purchased vaccine doses resulting in possible administration of state supplied vaccines to privately insured children. c) Accepting reimbursement from insurance com panies or patients for VFC vaccine as evidenced by: Administering VFC vaccine to a child and subsequently billing the child's insurance for the cost of the vaccine; Charging the patient for the cost of the vaccine; or Charging a Medicaid recipient any fee at all. Action Plan If a provider is found to be in violation of written VFC policies, the action taken will depend upon the policy violated, as follows: a) Vaccine unaccounted for in usage reports: Vaccine usage and inventory must be reported to the VFC office monthly. Vaccine accountability statements will be processed and remitted to the provider. These accountability statements tell the provider what their vaccine losses have been over the current reporting period. If accountability statements indicate unaccounted for VFC vaccine in excess of 5% for any vaccine for 3 consecutive reporting periods: 1. The assigned IPC will be informed; and 2. A site visit will be conducted before the next reporting period to investigate possible reasons for the vaccine inventory discrepancies. Future vaccine accountability statements must reflect 5% or less of vaccine loss. Possible consequences include, but are not restricted to: 1. A decrease in shipment of VFC vaccine; or 2. Providers replacing unaccounted for vaccines exceeding 5% of the total number of doses of vaccine available to be administered by the provider in the past 12 months. For example, if 10% of the provider's VFC provided Varicella vaccine is unaccounted for, then the provider may be asked to purchase 5% of the Varicella lost as replacement vaccine, or future shipments of Varicella will be decreased so that only the vaccine accounted for is replaced. Page 5 of 5 GIO Vaccine Loss Policy Rev. 4/11/2012 Decisions concerning the consequences of having unaccounted for vaccine will be made after receiving input from the IPC, the Vaccine Logistic Associate, VFC Coordinator, and the Deputy Director. b) VFC supplied vaccines knowingly administered to children not eligible for VFC. The VFC Coordinator or Vaccine Logistics Associate will notify the provider by letter detailing the following (when available): Name of child vaccinated; Date vaccine given; Each vaccine administered; Deadline for replacement of vaccine; Request for invoices for replacement vaccine; Request for action plan to prevent further misuse of VFC supplied vaccine; and Notification of future chart reviews by assigned Immunization Program Consultant. VFC staff will use the CDC Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirement Protocol (algorithm) to address future infractions. Upon receipt of written notification, any infractions or continued administration of VFC supplied vaccine to children not eligible for VFC will result in termination from the VFC. c) Accepting reimbursement from insurance companies or patients for VFC supplied vaccine. Providers found billing insurance companies or charging patients for state supplied vaccine will be notified of the infraction by letter from the VFC Coordinator or Vaccine Logistics Associate. The letter will include the following: Name of child vaccinated; Date vaccine given; Each vaccine administered and billed; Deadline for replacement of vaccine; Request for invoices for replacement vaccine; Request for action plan to prevent further fraudulent billing; and Notification of future chart reviews by assigned Immunization Program Consultant. VFC staff will use the CDC Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirement Protocol (algorithm) to address future infractions. Continued acceptance of reimbursement from insurance companies or patients for VFC supplied vaccine after receiving notification by letter will result in termination from the VFC Program. Reports from outside sources of fraudulent use of VFC supplied vaccine will be referred to the Deputy Director immediately. The assigned IPC will be asked to perform a site visit and chart review within 5 business days of the report. Findings will be reviewed with the provider and reported to the Deputy Director. Any action to be taken will be decided after receiving input from the IPC, the VFC Coordinator, the Vaccine Logistics Associate and the Deputy Director. Page 1 of 4 GA VFC Fraud and Abuse Policy Rev. 03/29/12 State of Georgia Immunization Office Georgia Department of Public Health Fraud and Abuse Policy (Appendix B) I. Background The purpose of this policy is to provide programmatic directi on for the prevention of fraud and abuse in the utilization of public (state-supplied and/or Vaccines for Children [VFC]) funded vaccine. The Georgia Immunization Office (GIO) is required by federal granting authorities to implem ent vaccine fraud and abuse prevention policies. Vaccines supplied through GIO are funded through several fe deral sources. For simplification purposes, those funding sources can be divided into two primary groups: VFC and non- VFC funds. VFC funds may be used to purchase vaccine for children and adolescents who are birth through 18 years of age (less than 19), and who are: Medicaid eligible Uninsured (have no health insurance) American Indian/Alaskan Native Underinsured (have health insurance that does not pay for vaccinations), seen in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), or Rural Health Centers (RHC) Non-VFC funds are utilized to purchase v accines for children and adolescents who are birth through 18 years of age (less than 19), and who are: Underinsured, seen in their medical home PeachCare for Kids TM Georgia VFC providers must adhere to the vaccine usage constraints relative to vaccine funding. Providers must administer this vaccine only to the aforementioned categori es of adolescents and children. Misuse of state/VFC-funded vaccine may result in civil or criminal penalties. The Fraud and Abuse Policy will be reviewed annually and u pdated, if necessary. Training on fraud and abuse will take place as part of new employee orientation. Additionally, program staff (VFC staf f and Immunization Program Consultants [IPCs]) will receive annual educational updates, led by the Deputy Director. II. Definitions Fraud is defined by Medicaid as \"an intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicable federal or state law.\" Abuse is defined by Medicaid as \"provider practices that are in consistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, [and/or including actions that result in an unnecessary cost to the immunization program, a health insurance company, or a patient]; or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. It also includes recipient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program.\" Examples of fraud and abuse include, but are not limited to, the following: Providing VFC vaccine to non VFC non-VFC-eligible children; Selling or otherwise misdirecting VFC vaccine; Page 2 of 4 GA VFC Fraud and Abuse Policy Rev. 03/29/12 Billing a patient or third party for VFC vaccine; Charging more than the established maximum regional charge ($14.81) for administration of a VFC-funded vaccine to a federally vaccine-eligible child; Not providing VFC-eligible children VFC-funded vaccine b ecause of inability to pay for the administration fee; Not implementing provider enrollment requirements of the VFC program; Failing to screen patients for VFC eligibility at every visit; Failing to maintain VFC records for a minimum of three (3 ) years or comply with other requirements of the VFC program; Failing to fully account for VFC-funded vaccine through re quired monthly reporting of doses administered, doses wasted, and inventory on hand; Failing to properly store and handle VFC vaccine; Ordering VFC vaccine or reporting vaccine usage in quan tities or patterns that do not match provider profile or otherwise involve over-ordering of VFC doses; Waste of VFC vaccine due to negligence. III. Compliance Assessment In order to receive vaccine from Georgia's VFC program, VFC-enrolled providers must comply with reporting requirements for vaccine usage including: doses administered by eligibility categor y, wastage, and inventory. Every vaccine order submitted is compared to the most recent provi der profile estimates, calculated by GIP, and approved by the provider. The provider profile is an estim ate of the number of VFC-eligible childre n the provider expects to see in a given year by eligibility category. These estimates are entered into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)- developed Vaccine Management System (VACMAN). Aggr egate vaccine orders exceeding annual profile data are identified by VACMAN. GIO staff contact providers that exceed profile amounts to determine if distribution of additional vaccine is justified, or if adjustments to the profile are needed. Upon enrollment and on a monthly basis thereafter, provider in formation is cross-checked against the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the Department of Health and Huma n Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General website. If located in the Exclusion database, providers are not allowed to participate in VFC. VFC Program staff has been trained to routinely review m onthly comprehensive reports for excessive use, underreporting, and anything that may look out of the ordinary. In addition, IPCs are requi red to review with the provider a vaccine accountability statement representative of at least six (6) mont hs, which can help identify areas of potential fraud and/or abuse. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provider, a nd unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will respond accordingly. VFC fraud or abuse determination is not a responsibility of GIO. However, GIO is required to report suspected VFC fraud and abuse to state and federal authorities. Unjustifie d, excessive, and/or repeated discrepancies between provider profile data, vaccine orders, and vaccine usage will be referred for further investigation as is required of the program. IV. Referrals The GIO Deputy Director is the person with primary respons ibility for responding to suspected fraud and/or abuse. The Deputy Director will have authority to make decisions, referrals , and notification when appropriate. In the event that the Deputy Director is not available, the VFC Coordinator will assume responsibility. In the event that neither of these individuals is available, the Program Director will assume responsibility. Should any individual, group, or practice want to report a suspected case of fraud and/or abuse, a dedicated Fraud and Abuse Hotline has been implemented and is monitored by th e Deputy Director. The Fraud and Abuse hotline number is (404) 657-5950. Reports must include (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Source of the allegation; 3. Source's name, address, and telephone number (if available) 4. A description of the reason for the report (suspected misconduct/violation) Page 3 of 4 GA VFC Fraud and Abuse Policy Rev. 03/29/12 5. Specific VFC requirements violated; 6. Value of vaccine involved (if available); 7. If the report was initiated in response to a complaint, a copy and/or summary of the complaint and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 8. Success of educational intervention; and 9. A summary of the result of any preliminary investiga tion conducted by GIO staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. Once a report is received, the Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirements Protocol will be used. This protocol has two levels of formal education - secondary and tertiary. Each level requires a minimum amount of education intervention and follow-up. For a provider to su ccessfully complete the Secondary Edu cation process, the provider must have corrected the situation. Tertiary Edu cation requires a full VFC compliance site visit, and the compliance issue must be resolved for the provider to be released from the educational intervention. For example, if an employee from a practice calls to report that the practice is failing to properly store vaccine, the IPC assigned to the provider will be notified that a storage and handling visit needs to be made. It is expected that the IPC will enter the provider into secondary education and take steps to resolve the issue, wh ich may involve suspending vaccine shipment until the situation is resolved. If the issue is not resolved the provider will be entered into Ter tiary Education. If the issue remains unresolved, the provider has more than three instances with the same issue, or any allegation where it is discovered that a provider is billing Medicaid inappropriately (inaccurate services, ineligible c lients, etc.), then the IPC will notify the Deputy Director immediately and provide the following information (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Specific VFC requirements violated; 3. Value of vaccine involved (if available); 4. If the report was initiated in response to a complaint, a copy or summary of the complaint and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 5. Success of educational intervention; and 6. A summary of the result of any preliminary investiga tion conducted by GIO staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. The Deputy Director will review all information submitted. Th e Deputy Director will initiate an internal investigation on all cases reported with sufficient evidence of fraud and abuse with in five days of the report. All suspected cases of VFC fraud and abuse will be forwarded electronically to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office and CDC within ten (10) business days following disposition. MIG will conduct preliminary investigations and, as warranted, transmit the re ferral to the appropriate oversight entity and will monitor the handling of the referral by entity. V. Allegation and Referral Database GIO will maintain a database to monitor and document all acti ons taken on allegations relate d to fraud and abuse of the VFC program requirements, including actions taken to address id entified situations. As requ ested, database will be made available to CDC. The following data will be collected for the database: 1. Provider's name (Medicaid ID if known); 2. Address; 3. Source of allegation; 4. Date allegation reported to program; 5. Description of suspected misconduct; 6. Specific VFC requirements violated; 7. Value of vaccine involved if available; 8. Success of educational intervention; 9. Disposition (closed, referred, entered in to educational process) of case; and 10. Date of disposition Page 4 of 4 GA VFC Fraud and Abuse Policy Rev. 03/29/12 V. Resolution Determination of fraud or abuse is made by the appropriate oversight entity. Provide rs identified to be engaged in VFC fraud or abuse will be suspended from the VFC program. Rein statement to the VFC program will be contingent on the outcome of proceedings conducted by the appropriate oversight entity. Final r esolution may include the following (not all-inclusive) interventions: remedial education, recoupmen t of funds, reinstatement without penalty, or referral for criminal prosecution or civil resolution. Providers who have been cleared of suspected fraud due to ex cusable lack of knowledge will be required to work with IPC staff to complete corrective action training sessions prior to reinstatement to the program. Trainings may include: Provider Refresher, Vaccine Storage and Handling, and Vacci ne Administration. IPC will be required to document all steps taken and will have authority to reinstate providers, wh ich will then be reviewed by the Deputy Director. In all cases, providers will be required to submit a corrective action plan in which the practice will be expected to outline how to avoid a similar situation in the future. In those instances where provider activities do not involve Medicaid or billing agenci es, GIO will work with the provider directly within the VFC policy guidelines. This may incl ude requiring education, susp ending vaccine shipments until corrective actions are taken, or termination from the VFC pr ogram. In any event that a provider's activities violate Medicaid requirements, the abovementioned no tification steps will be taken to inform Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 9. Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2012 Handling Of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions Revised 02/13/2012 1 Georgia Immunization Office Handling of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions To protect vaccine and to minimize the potential monetary loss from inclement weather conditions such as tornadoes; hurricanes; and tropical, ice, snow, rain, lightening, or wind storms, etc., emergency procedures at the provider level should be implemented immediately. A part of this implementation should include communi cation to all providers who receive publicly purchased vaccines, or at least to those in the geographic areas of highest risk. When the state/local officials or a provider has reasonable cause to believe that weather conditions have the potential to disrupt power and/or flood any office where vaccine is stored, emergency procedures should be implemented IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENT. In advance of the emergency, all providers should ensure the following: A. Identification of an alternative storage facility (hospital, packing plant, state depot, etc.), with back-up power (generator), where the vaccine can be properly stored and monitored for the duration of the storm (provider needs to ensure that the receiving site is able to store multiple sites, if they have signed agreements with multiple sites). A written agreement (updated annually) is strongly advised ; B. The availability of staff to pack and move the vaccine; C. The use of appropriate packing containers, certified thermometers, and cold packs; and D. The transport of the vaccine to the secure storage facility. It is appropriate for providers to suspend vaccinations before weather conditions deteriorate. Sufficient time must be allowed for packing and transporting vaccine BEFORE the storm can adversely affect local conditions. There are other precautions and appropriate measures one can take to protect vaccine inventories using the emergency procedures described below. The following includes some HELPFUL HINTS AND REFERENCE INFORMATION. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES A. List emergency phone numbers, companies, and points of contact for: 1. Electrical power company: 2. Refrigeration repair company: 3. Temperature alarm monitoring company: 4. Perimeter alarm repair company: 5. Perimeter alarm monitoring company: 6. Backup storage facility: Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 9. Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2012 Handling Of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions Revised 02/13/2012 2Georgia Immunization Program Handling of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions 7. Transportation to backup storage: 8. Emergency generator repair company: 9. National Weather Service: Satellite tracking of significant weather is also available at http://www.goes.noaa.gov/ . 10. f. Novartis: 800-244-7668 B. Providers may contact the Georgia Immunization Office (GIO) for assistance in identifying hospitals, health departments or other facilities that could serve as emergency vaccine storage facilities and communicate this information. This might also be done at the district or county level and/or with assistance from the Office of Emergency Preparedness. The GIO will prioritize assistance and communication to target providers in areas at highest risk, e.g., low lying coastal or floodplain areas. C. Entering vaccine storage spaces: Describe, when necessary, how to enter the building and vaccine storage spaces in an emergency if closed or after hours. Include a floor diagram and the locations of: 1. Doors 2. Flash lights 3. Spare batteries 4. Light switches 5. Keys 6. Locks 7. Alarms 8. Circuit breakers 9. Packing materials D. Identify whom to call for the following items: 1. Equipment problems 2. Backup storage 3. Backup transportation 4. Security Georgia Immunization Program Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 9. Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2012 Handling Of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions Revised 02/13/2012 3Handling of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions E. Identify what vaccines to pack first in an emergency and while the power is still working: 1. Pack the refrigerated vaccines first with an adequate supply of cold packs and certified thermometer(s). 2. Remove and pack the varicella vaccines, using cold packs and certified thermometer(s), immediately prior to transport F. Pack and transport all vaccine or if that is not possible, determine the types and amount to save; e.g., save only the most expensive vaccines to minimize dollar loss or save some portion of all vaccines to ensure a short-term, complete supply for resuming the vaccination schedule. Priority should be given to those vaccines which would be the most expensive to replace (pneumococcal conjugate, varicella, DTaP/HepB/IPV, Hep B/Hib, MMR). G. Follow vaccine packing procedures for transport to backup storage facilities: 1. Open refrigerated units only when absolutely necessary and only after you have made all preparations for packing and moving the vaccine to alternative storage sites. 2. Use properly insulated containers. 3. Do not place vaccines that cannot be frozen directly against cold packs. (Note: MMR can be stored frozen or refrigerated.) 4. Follow vaccine handling guidelines. The following are important tips to remember: --Varicella vaccine is fragile and should be used within 72 hours of placing on wet ice or in a refrigerated environment. --MMR vaccine can be refrigerated or frozen, but should be kept out of direct light. --All other vaccines should be maintained at refrigerator temperature. H. Move vaccine to backup storage according to pre-arranged plans. Pre-arranged plans should take into consideration the following: 1. How to load the transportation vehicle 2. Routes to take 3. Time enroute 4. Temperature monitoring (maintenance of temperature log with temperatures checked twice daily) while vaccine is in backup storage I. On returning inventory to the clinic/practice/pharmacy, vaccines should be checked carefully and placed in the appropriate refrigerator or freezer compartments. If the provider is not able to assure viability, GIO should be contacted before using any vaccines that may not be effective for protecting children and/or adults against disease.

A combination vaccine is defined as a product containing components that can be divided equally into independently available routine vaccines. A dash ( - ) between vaccine products indicates that products are supplied in their final form by the manufacturer and do not require mixing or reconstitution by the user. A slash ( / ) indicates that the products must be mixed or reconstituted by the user. General Information Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory DiseaseVaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices Vaccines must be stored properly from the time they are manufactured until they are administered. Immunization providers are responsible for proper storage and handling from the time vaccine arrives at the facility until the vaccine is given. Below is an outline of vaccine storage and handling best practices. CDC' s Storage and Handling Toolkit contains detailed information on vaccine management. Immunization providers and staff are strongly encouraged to review the Storage and Handling Toolkit annually. Educate all staff, including temporary staff, as part of new staff orientation. In addition, Vaccines for Children (VFC) providers should follow VFC policy and work with their immunization program. Vaccine Management includes, but is not limited to, these three components. 1. The equipment used for vaccine storage and temperature monitoring is reliable and appropriate. 2. Staff is knowledgeable regarding proper vaccine storage and handling. At least 2 staff members should be responsible for vaccine management. 3. Written storage and handling plans are updated at least annually for: - routine storage and handling of vaccines; and - emergency vaccine retrieval and storage . Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan should include the following four elements. 1. Ordering and Accepting Vaccine Deliveries Store vaccines at the recommended temperatures IMMEDIATELY upon arrival. - Store refrigerated vaccines between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). - frozen vaccines between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Ensure vaccines are delivered when the facility is open. Vaccine shipments should be delivered when staff is available to unpack and store the vaccine properly. Inform manufacturer/distributor when vaccine shipments can be delivered. VFC providers should also notify the immunization program. Consider holidays, vacations, changes in hours of operation, and staff schedules when ordering vaccines. Educate all facility staff about vaccine storage. Vaccine shipments are often accepted by nonmedical staff. They should be aware that vaccine needs to be stored according to the manufacturer's guidelines immediately upon delivery. Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 5 General Information Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease Order vaccines to maintain an adequate amount to meet the needs of the facility's patients. The amount of vaccine needed can vary throughout the year. Anticipate peak periods such as back-to-school appointments or influenza season and order accordingly. Order the vaccines and presentations that are appropriate for the ages and types of patients the facility serves. Influenza vaccine, for example, is available from many manufacturers with differing indications. Maintain a vaccine inventory log including: 1. vaccine name and number of doses received; 2. date vaccine received; 3. condition of vaccine on arrival; 4. vaccine manufacturer and lot number; and 5. vaccine expiration date. 2. Storing and Handling Vaccines Store vaccines in refrigerator and freezer units which can maintain the appropriate temperature range and are large enough to maintain the year's largest inventory without crowding. Stand alone units are preferred but household combination units with separate exterior doors and thermostats can be used. Dormitory-style refrigerators should not be used. A dormitory-style refrigerator is defined as a small combination freezer/refrigerator unit that is outfitted with one exterior door with an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. Store vaccine in storage units designated specifically for biologics. If biologic specimens must be stored in the same unit, these should be stored on a lower shelf to prevent contamination. Food and drinks should never be stored in the same unit with vaccines. Keep a calibrated thermometer with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration* in the refrigerator and freezer. These thermometers should be recalibrated as recommended by the manufacturer. Post \"Do Not Unplug\" signs next electrical outlets and \"Do Not Stop Power\" signs near circuit breakers to maintain a consistent power source. Read and document refrigerator and freezer temperatures at least twice each workday- in the morning and before the end of the workday. Keep temperature logs for at least 3 years. *Certificate of Traceability and Calibration thermometer with calibration measurements traceable to a testing laboratory accredited by the International organization of Standardization, to the standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or to another internationally recognized standards agency Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 6 Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 7National Center for Immunization and Respiratory DiseaseGeneral Information Store vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aim to maintain storage unit temperatures within the middle of the acceptable temperature range. This allows for the small temperature fluctuations that can occur in refrigerators and freezers without exposing vaccines to unacceptable temperatures. Ensure good air circulation around the vaccine in the storage unit. Proper air circulation is essential to maintaining the correct storage temperatures. Bins, baskets, or some other type of uncovered containers that allow for air circulation should be used to store the vaccines. There should be space between the containers to promote air flow. Store vaccines on the shelves away from the walls, and vents in the part of the unit best able to maintain the required temperature. Vaccines should never be stored in the door of the freezer or refrigerator . The temperature here is not stable. Place frozen packs in the door of the freezer and water bottles in the door of the refrigerator to help the storage unit maintain a constant temperature. Frozen packs or water bottle should be placed securely so they do not dislodge and prevent the door from closing. In addition, caution must be taken to avoid weighing down the door so much that the seal is compromised when the door is closed. Store unopened and opened vaccines in their original box with the lid in place until administration. Several vaccines must be protected from light. This practice also helps to ensure different vaccines are not stored together in the same bins or containers which can lead to vaccine administration errors. And in the event of a power failure, studies have shown storing vaccines in the box helps to maintain the vaccine at the appropriate temperature. Prepare vaccines at the time the vaccine is administered. This includes reconstituting or \"mixing\" vaccine, if indicated. Use only the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer. Store diluent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3. Managing Inventory Rotate stock so vaccine and diluent with the shortest expiration date is used first. Place vaccine with the longest expiration date behind the vaccine that will expire the soonest. Remove expired vaccine and diluent from usable stock. Keep vaccine stock well organized. VFC providers should separate and identify VFC and other vaccines purchased with public funds within the storage unit. In addition, clearly label the space where the vaccine is placed to help staff choose the appropriate vaccine. General Information Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease Inspect the storage unit daily. A physical inspection helps to ensure vaccines and thermometers are placed appropriately within the unit. During a busy work day, vaccines and thermometers can be easily moved or displaced to an area inappropriate for vaccine storage. Dispose of all vaccine materials using medical waste disposal procedures. Contact the immunization program for details and state specific guidance. 4. Managing Potentially Compromised Vaccines Identify and isolate all potentially compromised vaccines and diluents. Label these \"DO NOT USE\". Store separately from uncompromised vaccines and diluents in the recommended temperature range. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. Do not automatically discard the vaccine or diluent. Contact vaccine manufacturers and/or state immunization program for appropriate actions that should be followed for all potentially compromised vaccines and diluents. Educate staff administering vaccines on correct handling and preparation procedures to decrease the likelihood of vaccine or diluent inadvertently being compromised. For example, each vaccine should be prepared just prior to administration. Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan should include the following components. 1. Designate an alternate site where vaccines and diluents can be safely stored. Considerations when choosing a site include types of storage unit(s) available, temperature monitoring capabilities, and back-up generator. Potential back-up locations include local hospitals, another provider 's facility, retail or clinic pharmacies, long-term care facilities, or the Red Cross. Identify procedures that allow 24-hour access to alternate facilities. 2. Obtain and store an adequate number/amount of appropriate packing containers and materials (e.g., frozen and refrigerated gel packs, bubble wrap) in the facility that will be needed to pack vaccines for safe transport. Acceptable packing containers are described in the Storage and Handling Toolkit. Consider the year's largest inventory when stocking supplies. Store these supplies with a copy of the emergency vaccine retrieval and storage plan. Communicate to staff where everything is kept. 3. Include written directions for packing vaccines and diluents for transport. A calibrated thermometer should be placed in each packing container near the vaccine or refrigerated diluent.

However, 2C is exactly converted to 35.6F so the manufacturer's guidance for Fahrenheit is rounded by the manufacturer. Shelf Life Check expiration date on the container, vial or manufacturer-filled syringe of the vaccine AND diluent, if applicable. Do not use after the expiration date shown on the label. Preparation Inspect the vaccine visually for extraneous particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. DTaP, DTaP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix), DTaP-IPV (KINRIX), DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) vaccines should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for information on vaccine administration. DTaP, DTaP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix), DTaP-IPV (KINRIX): Just before use, shake vial or manufacturer-filled syringe well. After shaking, the vaccine should be a cloudy, white colored liquid. Do not use vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel): This vaccine is supplied in 2 vials that must be mixed together before administration. Consider posting reminders or labeling the vaccine to remind staff to reconstitute DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) prior to administering it. Only use the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer to reconstitute the vaccine. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for an example of a label and the educational handout \"Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them\". 1. Just before use, shake the vial of DTaP/IPV diluent. 2. Withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial (blue capped vial) and inject it into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine component (green capped vial). 3.

Do not discard vaccine unless directed to by the immunization program and/ or the manufacturer. NOTE: Contact the immunization program whenever VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Special Instructions Vaccines, including TIV, should be drawn from the vial into the syringe at the time of administration. CDC strongly discourages providers from prefilling syringes in advance. If more than one dose of vaccine must be predrawn, only draw up a few syringes (no more than 10 doses or the contents of one multidose vial). Provider prefilled syringes should be administered by the person who filled them. Any syringes prefilled by the provider must be stored within the recommended temperature range and used or discarded by the end of the workday. CDC recommends manufacturer-filled syringes for large immunization events, such as community influenza vaccination clinics. Once a manufacturer-filled syringe is activated (e.g., syringe cap removed or needle attached) it must be stored within the recommended temperature range and used or discarded by the end of the workday. Often providers have different TIV presentations in the same storage unit. Influenza products and presentations have different approved indications (e.g., ages, route). Storing multiple products and presentations can be confusing to staff and increase the risk for vaccine administration errors. Consider organizing vaccines in the storage unit by age group and/or color coding labels to distinguish vaccines from each other. Do not store sound-alike or look-alike vaccines next to each other.

Both components should arrive together in the same shipping container. The vaccine and diluent should be in separate compartments. Examine the shipping container and contents for damage during transport. Some vaccines are shipped with a temperature monitor. If a temperature monitor is present, check and follow the instructions. If the interval between shipment from the distributor/manufacturer and arrival of the vaccine at the facility has been more than 48 hours or you have questions about the condition of the vaccine at the time of delivery, you should take three steps. 1. Immediately place the vaccine in the recommended storage between -58\u00b0F and +46\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C). 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the distributor , manufacturer and/or the immunization program for guidance. NOTE: Contact the distributor and immunization program regarding shipments of Vaccines for Children (VFC) or other vaccines purchased with public funds that may not have been transported properly. Storage Requirements Store lyophilized vaccine and diluent according to the manufacturer 's guidelines immediately upon arrival. Lyophilized vaccine: Store MMR lyophilized vaccine in the refrigerator or freezer between -58\u00b0F and +46\u00b0F (-50\u00b0 and +8\u00b0C). Protect vaccine from light at all times by storing in the original box. Diluent: Store diluent in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F* and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C). Do not freeze or expose to freezing temperatures. *Storage temperatures between 36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) are specified in the label and the license for these products. However, 2C is exactly converted to 35.6F so the manufacturer's guidance for Fahrenheit is rounded by the manufacturer.

Do not use after the expiration date shown on the label. Preparation MMR is supplied in 2 vials that must be mixed together before administration. Consider posting reminders or labeling the vaccine to remind staff to reconstitute it. Only use the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer to reconstitute the vaccine. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for an example of a label and the educational handout \"Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them\". This vaccine should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. The Resources section at the end of this document also includes vaccine administration information. 1. Just before use, withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial and inject it into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine component. 2. Shake the vial now containing the lyophilized vaccine and diluent to mix thoroughly. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. 3. The reconstituted vaccine should be a yellow, clear liquid. Inspect visually for extraneous particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. Beyond Use Date*: Shelf Life after Opening All of the reconstituted vaccine should be drawn into a sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. Administer immediately. Unused, reconstituted MMR may be stored in the refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for up to 8 hours. Do not freeze or expose reconstituted vaccine to freezing temperatures. Protect reconstituted vaccine from light at all times. Agitate stored, reconstituted vaccine prior to administration. Do not administer reconstituted MMR vaccine if it is not used within 8 hours. Follow the immunization program guidance before discarding VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds. *The date or time after which the vaccine should not be used; determined from the date or time the manufacturer-filled syringe is activated, vial is entered or vaccine is reconstituted; may be different from the expiration date.

Vaccine providers should have a current emergency vaccine retrieval and storage plan that includes, but is not limited to, these four actions. 1. Place the vaccine in the recommended storage between -58\u00b0F and +46\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C). 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines.

Do not discard vaccine unless directed to by the immunization program and/ or the manufacturer. NOTE: Contact the immunization program whenever VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Special Instructions MMR vaccine can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer. Consider storing MMR in the freezer between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Storing MMR in the freezer can free up storage space in the refrigerator . More vaccines must be stored in the refrigerator than in the freezer . Storing MMR in the freezer increases the space available for vaccines that should be stored in the refrigerator. In addition, storing MMR in the freezer can decrease confusion when stocking both MMR and MMRV (ProQuad). MMRV must be stored in the freezer. MMRV has been inadvertently moved to the refrigerator storage because staff confused it with MMR. Storing MMR and MMRV in the freezer decreases the likelihood of this happening. MMR may be stored and/or transported in an insulated container between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). Place a calibrated thermometer in the container with the vaccine. Monitor and record the temperature. Use of dry ice is not recommended, even for temporary storage. Dry ice may subject MMR vaccine to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Providers can have different products or presentations containing the same vaccine in the storage unit, for example, MMR and MMRV (ProQuad) vaccines.

Do not use after the expiration date shown on the labels. Preparation These vaccines must be reconstituted before administration. Consider posting reminders or labeling the vaccine to remind staff to reconstitute it. Only use the diluent supplied by the vaccine manufacturer to reconstitute the vaccine. Refer to the Resources section at the end of this document for examples of labels and the educational handout \"Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them\". These vaccines should not be combined or mixed with any other vaccines. The Resources section at the end of this document also includes vaccine administration information. 1. Just before use, withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial and inject it slowly into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine vial. 2. Gently shake or agitate the vial now containing the lyophilized vaccine and diluent to mix thoroughly. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended with thorough agitation. 3. Inspect visually for extraneous particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be used. Reconstituted vaccine should have the following appearance: VAR: Clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid. ZOS: Semi-hazy to translucent, off white to pale, yellow liquid. MMRV: Pale yellow to light pink, clear liquid. Beyond Use Date*: Shelf Life after Opening All of the reconstituted vaccine should be drawn into a sterile syringe using a sterile needle at the time the vaccine is administered. Administer immediately. Unused, reconstituted varicella and MMRV vaccines may be stored at room temperature between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) for up to 30 minutes. Protect from light. Do not freeze or exposed reconstituted vaccine to freezing temperatures. Agitate any stored, reconstituted vaccine prior to administration. Do not administer reconstituted varicella-containing vaccine (VAR, ZOS, MMRV) if it is not used within 30 minutes.

Vaccine providers should have a current emergency vaccine retrieval and storage plan that includes, but is not limited to, these four actions. 1. Place the vaccine in the freezer between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Any freezer that has a separate sealed freezer door and reliably maintains a temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) is acceptable for storage of varicella-containing vaccines. 2. Mark vaccine \"Do Not Use\" and separate from uncompromised vaccines. A clearly labeled paper bag can be used for this purpose. 3. Follow your immunization program policy and contact the manufacturer and/or the immunization program for further guidance. 4. Do not discard vaccine unless directed to by the immunization program and/or the manufacturer. NOTE: Contact the immunization program whenever VFC or other vaccines purchased with public funds are exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range. Special Instructions In order to maintain temperatures between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C), it will be necessary in most combination refrigerator/freezer models to turn the temperature dial down to the coldest setting. This may result in the refrigerator compartment temperature being lowered as well. Careful monitoring of the refrigerator temperature will be necessary to avoid freezing vaccines stored in the refrigerator. \"Dormitory-style\" refrigerator/freezer is not appropriate for the storage of varicella- containing vaccines. A dormitory-style refrigerator is defined as a small combination freezer/refrigerator unit that is outfitted with one exterior door and an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. CDC and the vaccine manufacturer do not recommend transporting varicella- containing vaccines. If varicella-containing vaccines must be transported, CDC recommends transport with a portable freezer unit that maintains the temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Portable freezers may be available Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Page 72National Center for Immunization and Respiratory DiseaseSelected Biologicals for rent in some places. If varicella-containing vaccines must be transported and a portable freezer unit is not available complete the following actions: Varicella-containing vaccines may be transported at refrigerator temperature between 36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F, (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for up to 72 continuous hours prior to reconstitution. 1. Place a calibrated thermometer in the container used for transport as close as possible to the vaccine. 2. Record: a. the time the vaccine was removed from the storage unit and placed in the container b. temperature during transport c. document the time and temperature at the beginning and end of transport 3. According to the vaccine manufacturer, immediately upon arrival at the alternate storage facility: a. place the vaccine in the freezer between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Any freezer that has a separate sealed freezer door and reliably maintains a temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) is acceptable for storage of varicella-containing vaccines. b. document the time the vaccine was removed from the container and placed in the alternate storage unit. c. note that this is considered a temperature excursion, so contact the manufacturer at 1-800-637-2590 for further guidance . 4. Do not discard vaccine without contacting the manufacturer and/or the immunization program for guidance. Use of dry ice is not recommended, even for temporary storage or emergency transport. Dry ice may subject varicella-containing vaccine to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Providers can have different products or presentations containing the varicella- containing vaccines in the storage unit. For example, single antigen and combination vaccines. Vaccine products and presentations often have different approved indications and uses (e.g., ages, route). Storing multiple products and presentations can be confusing to staff and increase the risk for vaccine administration errors. Consider organizing vaccines in the storage unit by age group and/or color coding labels to distinguish vaccines from each other. Do not store sound-alike or look-alike vaccines next to each other. Labeling the space where the vaccine is stored with name and age indications can help prevent vaccine administration errors.

October 2012 1 of 5 Vaccine Storage and Handling INTERIM GUIDANCE Introduction In response to recent scientific studiesi on equipment used for vaccine storage and a better understanding of best practices for vaccine storage and handling, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing interim guidance on appropriate vaccine storage and handling practices . This guidance is intended for use by all public and private sector providers and, while recognizing that cost may be a barrier, we encourage practices to move toward implementing th ese recommendations as soon as possible . CDC is currently evaluating the most efficient and cost effective method to phase these recommendations in and more guidance is forthcoming. With the goal of improving the way providers store and handle vaccines nationwide, several important changes have been made to previous recommendations issued by CDC, including: 1. Use of a biosafe glycol -encased probe or a similar temperature buffered probe rather than measurem ent of ambient air temperatures, and; 2. Use of digital data loggers with detachable probe s that record and store temperature information at frequent programmable intervals for 24 hour temperature monitoring rather than non -continuous temperature monitoring , and; 3. Use of stand -alone refrigerator and stand -alone freezer units suitable for vaccine storage rather than combination (refrigerator+freezer) or other units not designed for storing fragile biologics , such as vaccines , and; 4. Discontinuing use of dorm -style or bar- style refrigerator/freezers for ANY vaccine storage, even temporary storage, and; 5. Weekly review of vaccine expiration dates and rotation of vaccine stock. More detail regarding these changes and the rationale behind them is included below. Vaccine Storage and Handling, Interim Guidance CDC/NCIRD October 2012 2 of 5 Biosafe Glycol -Encased Probe s or Similar Temperature Buffer ed1Probes CDC recommends use of a digital thermometer with a biosafe glycol -encased probe or a similar temperature buffered probe that will more closely approximate the measure of liquid temperature. A temperature buffer enables a thermometer probe to more closely match the temperature changes experienced by stored vaccine. Examples of temperat ure buffers are a probe inserted into a glycol- filled vial or one inserted into glass beads. CDC recommends this type of probe because studies by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) , U .S. Dept of Commerce i conducted in 2009 showed that compared to temperature monitors that measure ambient air temperature, the digital thermometer with glycol -encased probe more accurately reflects the temperature of the vaccine vial and do es not register normal air temperature fluctuations which do n ot significantly impact vaccine temperature . Because the main factor affecting potency of refrigerated vaccines is exposure to freezing temperatures, i t is important that glycol -encased or similar temperature buffered probes be placed among the vaccines in stead of on a wall, and at least for refrigerated vaccines, in the part of the refrigerator unit where manufacturer recommended vaccine storage temperatures can best be maintained . To ensure validity of temperature measurements, only calibrated thermometers with a certificate of Traceability and Calibration should be used. Calibrated thermometers will continue to be a requirement for providers who receive VFC vaccine. Digital Data Loggers for Temperature Monitoring In addition to the use of a digital thermometer with a biosafe glycol -encased or similar t emperature buffered probe, the thermometer should also be able to provide and store data monitoring information set at programmable intervals in an active display that allows for reading temperatures without opening the unit door. This means that the digital data logging thermometer probe should be able to remain in place and not be disturbed during data reading and recording. A detachable probe facilitates downloading tempera ture data without removing the probe from the storage unit, and should simplify daily use and minimize operator cause of temperature variability . The digital data logger should also include the following : Hi/Lo a larm for out -of-range temperatures ; Curren t temperature , as well as minimum and maximum temperatures ; Reset button ; 1 The purpose of a temperature buffer is to slow the response time of the probe to temperature changes so that it matches the temperature changes experienced by the vaccine. Vaccine Storage and Handling, Interim Guidance CDC/NCIRD October 2012 3 of 5 Low battery indicator; Accuracy of +/- 1\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C); Memory storage of at least 4000 readings, device will not rewrite over old data and stops recording when memory is full ; User programmable logging interval (or reading rate) . These changes in the use of systems for continuous temperature monitoring mean more accurate and comprehensive monitoring of any temperature excursions to which vaccines may have been exposed , and diminish the need for opening the unit door while conducting this routine monitoring. Finally, it is a requirement for VFC pro viders and a recommend ation for all providers that storage unit temperatures continue to be read and documented twice each workday . It is recommended that minimum/maximum temperatures be checked and documented once per day preferably in the morning . Reviewing the minimum/maximum temperatures helps to ensure that temperature excursions will be identified more quickly and corrections ma de that can prevent vaccine loss, as well as minimize the inaccuracy of generalizing twice daily measurements . Stored temperature monitoring data should be downloaded and reviewed at least weekly by providers , both to ensure the timely review of the data and the appropriate response to issues. When the data is downloaded, the data logger should be reset so there is sufficient memory available. T he downloaded information should be kept for a minimum of 3 years or according to individual state record retention requirements. These practices ensure that the data logger will continue to function properly with sufficient memory for accurate monitoring and that problems with storage equipment can be identified and corrected early. Stand-A lone Refrigerator and Stand- Alone Freezer Units CDC strongly recommends the use of stand -alone refrigerator and stand -alone freezer units, meaning a self- contained unit that only refrigerates or freezes and is suitable for vaccine storage . These units can vary in size, from a co mpact, under -the-counter style to a large, stand- alone, pharmaceutical grade storage unit. CDC does not recommend use of dormitory2 or bar- style refrigerator/freezers for ANY vaccine storage. The use of these specific refrigerator/freezers is not allowed at any time for Vaccines for Children (VFC) program providers. 2 Dormitory -style or bar -style refrigerator is defined as a small combination freezer/refrigerator unit that is outfitted with one exterior door and an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. Please note that there are compact, purpose- built storage units for biologics that are not considered to be dormitory -style or bar styl e. Vaccine Storage and Handling, Interim Guidance CDC/NCIRD October 2012 4 of 5 The characteristics of a recommended storage unit include: 1) enough room to store the year's largest inventory without crowding and 2) sufficient room to store water bottles in the refrigerator and frozen coolant packs in the freezer to stabilize the temperature and minimize temperature excursions that can impact vaccine potency . The addition of water bottles (not gel packs) reduces the risk of freezing due to the tremendous latent heat released from water prior to freezing. In addition, frost -free or automatic defrost cycle units are preferred. Because freezing of refrigerated vaccines affects vaccine potency more than other expo sure problems, it is especially important that refrigerators be selected and set up in a way that eliminates the chance of freezing vaccine. Use of stand -alone units is a best practice. Studies by NISTi show that 1) dormitory -style or bar-style combinati on units pose a significant risk of freezing vaccine even when used for temporary storage , and 2 ) the usual house -hold single -condenser combination refrigerator/freezer units are less capable of simultaneously maintaining proper storage temperatures in the refrigerator and freezer compartments. These refrigerators are cooled by venting cold freezer air into the refrigerated section - thus a real risk of freezing vaccine near the cooling vents. An alternative to stand -alone units is to use only the refrigerator compartment of a combination household refrigerator/freezer unit to store refrigerated vaccines and to be very careful not to use the top shelf if the vent from the freezer opens there. A separate stand -alone freezer should then be used to store froze n vaccines ; this is because the freezer compartment of a combined house -hold unit should not be used for vaccine storage if the refrigerator unit is being used for that purpose. Procedures for Efficient Management of Vaccines Each provider practice (each location) should have written storage and handling plans, updated annually, both for routine storage and handling of vaccines, and for emergency vaccine retrieval and storage. Plans for routine storage and handling of vaccines should include detailed des cription s of the procedures for: 1) ordering and accepting vaccine deliveries; 2) storing and handling vaccines (e.g., ensuring that refrigerated vaccines are stored between 35\u00b0F and 46 \u00b0F [2\u00b0C and 8 \u00b0C] and frozen between - 58\u00b0F and +5 \u00b0F [-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C]); 3) managing potentially compromised vaccines (i.e ., vaccine that has been exposed to temperatures outside of the recommended range defined above ); 4) managing vaccine inventory (e.g., checking vaccine and diluent expiration dates weekly and removing expired items from usable stock) ; and 5) downloading and reviewing electronic monitoring data weekly . Vaccine Storage and Handling, Interim Guidance CDC/NCIRD October 2012 5 of 5 Another necessary component of good practice is ensuring adequately trained vaccination personnel at all levels. This includes personnel that can serve as designated primary and back -up vaccine coordinators , both permanent and temporary staff who are familiar with proper storage and handling policies and procedures , comprehensive storage and handling training for both new staff and maintaining competence of current staff, and accountability checks to ensure protocols are followed . It is also important that a physician partner or member of management is directly involved with the responsible clinical staff - someone with a clear understanding of the vaccine replacement costs of miss -managed refrigerators and vaccine. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding this Interim Guidance are available on o ur website. The change s summarized in this Interim Guidance will also be reflected in a comprehensive update of CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit ( target date for publication Fall 2012). I n addition, CDC's posted guidance will continue to be updated as necessary to reflect best practices on vaccine storage and handling. For example , ongoing and planned studies with NIST, U .S. Department of Commerce are being conducted to better understand areas such as optimizing f requency of checking temperature recording by data loggers and packing of vaccine vial boxes for transport .

It will also main- tain recommended temperatures if the cooler is exposed to outside temperatures as low as -4\u00baF for one of those 12 hours.If the vaccine will be stored in refrigerators after transport, be sure those refrigerators have maintained temperatures be- tween 35\u00baF and 46\u00baF for at least 3 to 5 days. Assemble packing supplies 1. Cooler. Use hard plastic Igloo-type coolers. Attach a \"Vaccines: Do Not Freeze\" label to the cooler. 2. \"Conditioned\" cold packs. Condition frozen gel packs by leaving them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until the edges have defrost-ed and packs look like they've been \"sweating.\" Cold packs that are not conditioned can freeze vaccine. Do not use dry ice. 3. Thermometer. Prepare the thermometer by placing it in the refrigera- tor at least 2 hours before you pack the vaccine. 4. Packing material. Use two 2-inch layers of bubble wrap. Not using enough bubble wrap can cause the vaccine to freeze. Pack vaccine Spread conditioned cold packs to cover only half of the bot-tom of the cooler. Spread \"conditioned\" cold packs to cover only half of the bubble wrap. Make sure that the cold packs do not touch the boxes of vaccine.Completely cover the vaccine with another 2-inch layer of bubble wrap. Fill the cooler to the top with bubble wrap.

Georgia Department of Public Health Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement for Public Health Nursing Practice June 2012 1 QUALITY ASSURANCE /QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FOR IMMUNIZATION PRACTICE FO R PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES INTRODUCTION The Georgia Immunization Office , under the Department of Public Health , produces both an Immunization Office Manual and an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommendations No tebook that outline the recommended Policies and Procedures for adm inistering vaccines by registered nur ses and for providing immunization services. An advisory committee consisting of district immunization coordinators and pediatricians, a state pharmacist and the Immunization Program management team , review and update these manuals on an on going basis. Each district is responsible for having written policies and procedures for the administration of vaccines that have been reviewed and signed annually by the health director or their designee. Districts are encouraged to either utilize the Policies and Procedures outlined in the Georgia Immunization Office Manual and the ACIP Recommendations Notebook, or to write their own which should be consistent wit h those outlined in these two references. PURPOSE The purpose of this quality assurance tool is to document the traini ng /education expectations and the parameters of clinical practice immunization services. Use of this tool will help pr omote consistency in practice across programs on a statewide basis. Quality assurance will provide an opportunity to ident ify excellence in practice, as well as opportunities for improvement. The components of this tool may be used to conduct QA reviews of training programs, administration of vaccines by registered nurses. These revi ews may be done by Public Health staff from either the local and/or state level. The credentialing, training, and educati on expectations, as well as the paramete rs of clinical practice for Licensed Practical Nurses in immunization servi ces are located in Chapter 13 of the Ge orgia Immunization Office Manual. This tool may be used when evaluating immunization services provided by Licensed Practical Nurses.
