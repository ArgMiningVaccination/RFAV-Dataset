In 2022, a vaccination programme against pneumococcal infections for risk groups started. Additional vaccinations are recommended for children and adults at risk. All vaccinations within national vaccination programmes are voluntary and offered free of charge. The vaccination programmes are governed by the Communicable Diseases Act and regulations issued by the Public Health Agency of Sweden. [Responsibility for national programmes](/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/vaccinations/responsibility-for-national-programmes/) Vaccination programme for children The vaccinations that are offered to all children protect against eleven diseases: rotavirus infection, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella, serious pneumococcus and human papillomavirus (HPV). The vaccinations are offered at different ages or at school, according to the vaccination schedule in the table below. Since 2016, all regions also offer all infants vaccinations against hepatitis B at 3, 5 and 12 months of age. Most vaccines that are part of the Swedish child vaccination programme are given as combination vaccines, i.e. vaccines against several diseases are given in the same shot in order to minimize the number of injections. Before starting school, children are offered vaccinations within the framework of the child health services, usually at well-baby clinics (\"Barnav\u00e5rdscentral\", BVC). Vaccinations offered during school-age are the responsibility of the school health services (\"Elevh\u00e4lsan\"). Children who have missed vaccinations or arrived in Sweden later than the scheduled time of vaccination are eligible for catch-up vaccinations.
