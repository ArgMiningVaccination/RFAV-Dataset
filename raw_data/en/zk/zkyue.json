What better recovery for a car accident's unfortunate victim than to lie in a darkened room, inhaling the sweet smells of pungent lotions? And what better still than to get somebody else to pay for it? In recent months, the claims department at a large property-casualty company has been getting a growing stream of claims for these services, known as aromatherapy. \"It is a new, creative outgrowth of the never-ending cycle to treat innovatively at our expense,\" grumbles the claims manager of the company which, given the onslaught of innovation, is bashful about revealing its name. Demand for aromatherapy follows the increased popularity of other \"alternative\" treatments\u2014techniques that are not often taught in schools of western medicine. Among the most common are acupuncture, massage, and chiropractic services. At the very least, it can be a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. It may even help. \"Soft-tissue\" injuries, particularly those around the neck, are notoriously hard to diagnose and repair with any precision. With great gaps in knowledge still remaining, medicine remains part-art. Do insurance companies really know where to draw the line between scam and need? Suffice to say that they would like to try. What angers the insurers about the legal status of treatment in New York is that many claims must be paid, no questions asked. Far from being pre-approved, bills are submitted months after the \"treatment\" has taken place. The \"personal injury protection\" portion of New York's no-fault car-insurance law is unpermissably permissive, in contrast to tough policies set in other states. Perhaps it is not surprising that claims under New York's generous policy are 44% higher than the national average, according to the New York Insurance Association. These higher costs, it goes without saying, translate into higher premiums. Don't bother fretting about this. Call it an accident of fate, and try breathing deeply.
