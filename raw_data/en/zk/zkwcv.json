From this time to 1987, Faro opened seven more pizza shops in the area. In 1990, Faro sold the franchise with the idea that he and his family would be moving back and living in Sicily. As it happens many times, circumstances changed and the family back to Grand Rapids. Faro was, once again, in the restaurant business when he opened Uccello's Ristorante Pizzeria & Sports Lounge on East Beltline in 1996. Uccello's Ristorante has officially opened 6 locations in the last 23 years. Faro didn't want to stop there. In 2016, Uccello's Hospitality Group expanded when opening their first fast-casual concept, Herb & Fire Pizzeria, located in Grandville. Since then, UHG has opened a second location by Celebration! Cinema North at the corner of Knapp & East Beltline. Uccello's Hospitality Group has grown into Eight successful locations, inspired by Faro's personal philosophy: \"Always strive to give your guest more than they would normally expect. Provide people the opportunity to enjoy great food and the hospitality to match. You must always strive to be better in everything, and never compromise on top quality in any area.\" We Love our community! | | fundraisers We host special nights on behalf of your organization, where proceeds of our sales go towards your cause.
