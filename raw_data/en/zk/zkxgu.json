RESEARCH PROMOTION FOUNDATION Background of the foundation -Society & Economy: The importance of infectious disease research was reaffirmed due to the once -in-a-lifetime COVID - 19 pandemic -Pharmaceutical companies: Efforts against infectious diseases have tended to be reduced or withdrawn from a business feasibility perspective, leading to loss of employment opportunities for researchers -Academia: Lack of funds and employment irrespective of the disease area and the avoidance of infectious disease area where the market size is small have posed a problem for the fostering of young researchers Considering a new academic research support scheme Activity details (Annual budget: Around 300 million yen is planned) -Granting subsidies for research on infectious diseases; awards for distinguished achievements -Hosting lectures and symposiums on infectious diseases ..and more Interest bearing issuance of treasury shares with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank as the trustee and the Foundation as the beneficiary (3 million shares) -To be submitted as a matter for special resolution at the 157th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on June 23, 2022 Fulfill our
