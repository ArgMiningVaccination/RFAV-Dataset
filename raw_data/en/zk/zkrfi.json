Here's what you need to be aware of when using TCM: By Dr Michelle LIM, Associate Consultant and Associate Professor Tan Thiam Chye, Visiting Consultant, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, KK Women's and Children's Hospital Some women use Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, as they believe it might help maintain a healthy reproductive system. In this ancient practice, it's commonly believed that the most important organs that govern the qi (life force) and blood are the liver, spleen and kidneys. The TCM viewpoint is that a liver malfunction might result in menstrual disorders; and an issue with the spleen might cause deficiencies in blood and qi, which might disrupt menstrual cycles. The kidney also plays a big role in excreting biological waste products and water from the body. It's very important that you consult a licensed TCM physician before starting on any treatment.
