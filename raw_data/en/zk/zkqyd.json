COVID-19 is not going away, so it's important not to let our guard down. The COVID-19 virus is still circulating in King County and we're still seeing hospitalizations and deaths. There's also no guarantee that the virus won't continue to evolve in unpredictable ways. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions remain especially vulnerable. People of all ages, including those who were previously healthy, are at risk for long COVID. These are longer term symptoms that can happen after even mild infections. For questions about COVID-19, please call the Washington State Department of Health at [18005250127](tel:+1-800-525-0127). How you can protect against COVID-19 We can live our lives and also keep ourselves, loved ones and community as safe as possible. How? By using all the tools we've learned so far: - The best protection is to [get vaccinated](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/vaccine/distribution.aspx). Stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations, especially if you're 50 and older or if you have a health condition. [Wear a mask](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/care/masks.aspx)in high-risk settings (such as crowded places) to protect yourself and others, especially people with medical conditions who are less able to fight the virus. [Test for COVID-19](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/testing.aspx)if you have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who tests positive. - If you test positive for COVID-19 or are at higher risk from the disease, [getting COVID-19 treatment early](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/therapeutics)can help to protect from severe illness and hospitalization. Ask your healthcare provider to see if treatment is recommended for you. - Keep activities small and outdoors if people who are unvaccinated will participate. [Reduce the virus in the air](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/ventilation.aspx)by having good air flow indoors and using air filters. [WA State Dept. of Health's "}
