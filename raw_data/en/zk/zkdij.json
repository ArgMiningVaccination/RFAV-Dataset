Every detail and session was well thought out and executed with love and grace. She provided healthy, nutritious foods and offered tips on what to eat and drink to help overcome cravings. Sessions were facilitated so I was able to look at my challenges in life and come home with tools to help me grow in the areas I need to. I was surrounded with love and support to go thru the experiences designed for us to let go of difficulties we are holding on to. Thank you Julia for your guidance, for sharing your tools, and for your gracious heart. MilissaPosted 9 months ago on BookRetreats Dallas CPosted a year ago on BookRetreats It was a wonderful and impactful retreat. I felt so welcomed and comfortable the whole time. I had multiple people tell me something had changed in me in the weeks following the retreat. I will not forget what I took away and also left behind while there! I look forward to attending another retreat with Julia. Anastassiya IPosted a year ago on BookRetreats Julia's Joshua Tree retreat contributed profoundly to my transformation journey. I discovered in more depth the part of me that is playful, adventurous, and fearless; testing the limits and making daring plans while surrounded by the most supportive, open-minded, and empathetic group of people that I now call Family.
