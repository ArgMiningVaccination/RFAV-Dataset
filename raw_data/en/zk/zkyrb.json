Many people come to us because they want an integrated approach for restoring or maintaining their health. As a result they may combine diet, acupuncture, herbal medicine as well as the unique constitutional approach to healing that Ayurveda offers. Others clearly chose to use only one modality, i.e. acupuncture for musclo-skeletal pain or nutrition for diabetes. If you are not sure which approach suits you we will gladly speak with you. In fact, Don or Paulette personally speak with all potential patients and clients by phone before they make an appointment. "}
