This tradition of scientific excellence combined with practical applications has continued to this day, and created a growing and loyal audience of medical and mental health practitioners who return year after year to learn the latest in integrative mental health. Not only is IMMH a place of learning and excellence, but it is also a place where pioneering mental health practitioners can come from around the world to meet and share notes, case studies and best practices, support each other and have fun in what is sometimes a lonely landscape. Being one of the minority of global practitioners delivering integrative mental health can be an isolating and stressful experience, often requiring the resilience to go up against mainstream dogma, and demanding more knowledge, time and often fewer financial rewards than conventional medical practice. And yet, it's the only type of medicine that many practitioners with heart and conscience want to practice, as they see that it's the one offering the most sustainable results for their patients. IMMH offers a supportive community for these visionary and courageous practitioners. IMMH has become the most established, credible brand bringing together a community of hundreds of medical and healthcare practitioners from around the world to collaborate, communicate and learn about the latest research and best clinical practice in integrative mental health and functional medicine psychiatry.
