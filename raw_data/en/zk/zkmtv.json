It is a natural health care system that works with the communication net work in your body, the nervous system, to keep your body as healthy as possible. The human body works best, and is therefore healthy, when all of its parts are working in unison. The nervous system (the brain, spinal cord, and nerves) connects with every cell in your body and constantly monitors all body functions to ensure that everything is working together properly. The vertebrae that protect your spinal cord very often misaligned and exert pressure on the nerves as they exit the spinal cord. This causes the nerves to malfunction and can cause many problems with your health. These vertebral misalignment (termed subluxations) can be relieved through careful chiropractic care. A chiropractor is the only trained professional that can successfully diagnose and treat vertebral subluxations. Dr. Salamone and his expert staff will do everything to ensure that you receive the highest level of chiropractic care available. It is this expert service that separates Dr. Salamone's office from others. If you have any questions or would like to discuss your condition with Dr. Salamone, simply call the office at 973-227-3456. [Lyme Disease](/lyme-disease) Many people suffer from Lyme Disease! Many people don't even know that they have it! It is a disease that is difficult to diagnose and often mistreated. Tick checks on the body are essential for prevention. Once properly diagnosed, treatment can be very effective. By combining Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Nutrition, and Orthodox Medicine, Dr. Salamone has been a forefront pioneer in education and treatment of these tick-born illnesses, especially Lyme Disease and its co-infections.

[Health Experts Offer Tips For Staying Well While Working From Home ](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/03/22/health-experts-offer-tips-for-staying-well-while-working-from-home/) Staying at home all day provides a number of new health obstacles during this unprecedented time. Some doctors shared tips on how you can keep you and your family healthy. One health obstacle is posture since many people are working from home on their phone or computer, and not always working at a desk like normal. \"Everybody's going to be in sitting postures, having text neck,\" chiropractor Dr. Joseph D. Salamone said to CBS2's John Elliot. \"These people really need to make precautions and live a healthier lifestyle while we're in this quarantine state.\" Dr. Salamone recommended three stretches everyone can do to keep healthy. Spinal twists should be done before you get up in the morning. Dr. Salamone said to sit on the side of your bed with your hands on your knees and twist 15 - 20 times each side. \"What it does is it hydrates your discs and gets you ready for your day,\" said Dr. Salamone. Next, Dr. Salamone recommended doing hamstring stretches before you get moving. Finally, neck stretches. Roll up a towel with elastic bands on each side. Lay down with the rolled towel under your neck and your head bent back with your neck in extension. Dr. Salamone said to do this 2 - 3 times a day to really help with your posture. "}
