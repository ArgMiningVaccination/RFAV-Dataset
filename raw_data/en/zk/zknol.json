Top ways to experience Confluence of the Indus and Zanskar Rivers and nearby attractions The area Best nearby Restaurants 2 within 3 miles Attractions 2 within 6 miles See what other travelers are saying - One of the best bike trips of my lifeThe Confluence - Indus & Zanskar - At times, at the Sangam, the Indus River can be seen as shiny blue while the Zanskar river is dirty green. In the summer season, Zanskar is swollen and rapid, while Indus is comparatively calmer. In the winters, it is quite the opposite. Zanskar slows down, its flow is light and is completely frozen at a lot of places, enabling the legendary Chadar Trek. While Indus flows fast, with ice floating on it. Be it the summer or the winter season, the confluence of these two magnificent rivers is not a sight to be missed when you are in Ladakh. It is a remarkable depiction of nature's subtle magical nuances. Visited September 2019Written June 11, 2020 - Mesmerizing and beautifulOne of nature's finest creation to be looked at and be amazed. Nestled between gigantic barren mountains, the two rivers, Indus and Zanskar find themselves to be united at this point. The shadow of the mountains and the colours of sky paint a confluence of pictures on the water surface. The water body is simply mesmerizing. It is a great spot to do river rafting as the current seems to be very tame. There is a river rafting company near the confluence and a small cafe to eat something.Visited May 2019Traveled as a coupleWritten February 26, 2020 - Sangam in LehThis place looks so beautiful from up the hill and you can snap some really great photos here. The flow of water is very fast so I would recommend keeping an eye on the kids. Also there a few snacks here if you want to grab a quick bite on your way back to Leh. One of the rivers actually comes from Pakistan.Visited June 2019Written January 14, 2020 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Both of them originate in the high Himalayas. While the Indus originates in the Changthang Cold Desert, the Zanskar river originates in the Zanskar ranges. Both these Himalayan rivers join at a scenic setting near the town of Nimmu in Ladakh.

Aug 2013 Couples India got its name from Indus river and the Hinduism developed on the banks of this river. Watching Indus for any lover of history is an emotional experience. It is unfortunate that a large part of this river flows through Pakistan. Standing on the banks of this river realizing its importance in shaping the history of this great nation will be a moving experience.

Aug 2013 Friends I had always heard about the different colours of rivers, & how, at the confluence, one can notice the distinction. But it came alive for me only at the confluence of the Indus & Zanskar rivers. The Indus is of a muddy brown colour while Zanskar is a slaty grey. The confluence is calm, despite the fact that Zanskar is a river that has rapids. You can try river-rafting too. In winter, it is known for its Chadar trek, i.e., trek on the frozen river. The view on the way to the confluence is impressive too. Must must see! Written October 14, 2013 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Jul 2013 Friends Excellent and thrilling rafting experience in Zanskar-River. Also known as White Water Rafting. The journey of 3 hrs and 30 km stretch was worthwhile.

Aug 2013 Family I HAVE SEEN LAKES IN SWITZERLAND, AUSTRIA AND ITALY BUT PANGONG TSO IS THE BEST. I think Pangong Tso is the best attraction, but for my two children and I, the exciting experience of white water rafting on the Zanskar river was perhaps one of the most exhilarating activities we have ever done. The rapids are Grade 3 and rafting 30km with a 10-minute break lasted a total of 3 hours. Our Indian guide Vicky Chetri divides his time rafting between Hrishikesh and Ladakh. They give you an orientation for 10 minutes and then off you go! When you hit a rapid, then follow the guide's instructions to a T - that way you don't get scared. There is often a canoeist who is never too far from you. Number 3 attraction would have to be the massive Buddha statue in Diskit, Nubra valley. Number 4 attraction would be Shanti Stupa in Leh, and close by Number 5 attraction is the glorious Army Hall of Fame Museum. Number Six attraction is the drive around Khardungla Pass at 18,000 feet. Please spend the first 2 days acclimatising in Leh. Absolute must.

Hi , Of course you can do river rafting at the Confluence of the two rivers . Rafts are there . Levels 1 &2 possible. Must know swimming . The place is around an hours drive from Leh. And it's very cold and windy . Can we visit magnetic Hill and gurdwara pathar sahib and Shanti Stupa leh palace on the first day (17th July )after arriving from Delhi???some people say it would not be possible,we had already booked back flight on 21st,so we had less time 2nd day khardungla pass and confluence of Indus and zanskar river & nubra & back leh 3rd day pangong 4th day return from pangong local sight seeing if we had time 5th day back to delhi Sapna i would suggest complete rest, ie not even having a bath or climbing stairs the day you arrive. You will feel nauseating and a dull headache the entire day. So pls rest on the 1st day...then only will you enjoy the rest of your trip. We a family of 4 with 2 teenage sons took 1 Diamox everyday.And have lots of water. We are visiting leh on 17th July and will be back on 21st morning.would you please guide me ,which places to visit and what type of clothes do we need??? pangong is must!!! Nubra and pangong are a must. To me monasteries are all same and one seen all see. If you are little bit of a dare devil go for rafting at zanskar River. Pl take warm clothes. Take homeopathic medicine coca6 and have six globules in the morning and evening. This is for your breathing and high mountain sickness What is the age limitation for rafting in zanskar river children below 10 years of age Will it be frozen in December starting? And is it a problem visiting alone? What are the necessary things to carry? Am visiting leh for the first time.. am alone.. what are the best places to visit? And will it be a problem journeying alone? This is my first trip ever.. what are the necessary things to carry.. can someone please help! This time of the year Leh would be freezing cold - therefore you must carry good jackets, warm clothes, gloves etc to keep yourself warm. Also since Leh is a high altitude place, you should carry medicines like Diamox tablets to help you get rid of mountain sickness.

Will it be accessible in January last week and will it be frozen ? it should be Altitude of the confluence of Zanskar and Indus The altitude of the confluence is lower than Leh.
