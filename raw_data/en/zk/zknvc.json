Below are some basic guidelines for visiting Tribal Lands: Please be attentive to signage, and obey individual Tribal laws and regulations. Use caution when driving, especially at night. Most Tribal land is open range, and small herds of sheep, goats, cattle and horses move freely along and across roads. Alcohol use is only permitted in designated locations, such as a casino. Drug use is not tolerated. Taking photos, video and audio recordings, as well as sketching, are particularly sensitive issues. Ask before photographing or recording an individual, an event or activity. Permits may be required, and fees and restrictions vary, particularly for professionals. Dances are sacred ceremonies. Observe them as you would any other religious function by dressing and acting appropriately. Be mindful of where you sit, stand and walk. Never pick up any object that is dropped during a ceremony. Please refrain from talking to the ceremonial dancers. Applause after ceremonial dances is considered inappropriate. Some of the Tribal buildings and structures may be several hundred years old and can damage easily; do not climb on walls or other structures. Do not disturb or remove animals, plants, rocks or artifacts, including pot shards, as Tribal and federal laws prohibit the removal of such items. Like any community, Tribal Lands are home to those who live and work there and should be respected as such. Although most areas are open to the public during daylight hours, the homes are private and should be entered only by invitation. 177180A 181186188260260 260264 8585 868687 878787 87 88 88 909595 2 15815160 18018018 191163 191 191 R.Little Colorado R.
