Rep MMWR. 2001;50:1-52 Pickering LK, ed. 2003 Red Book Report on the Committee on Infectious Dis- eases . 26th ed. Elk Grove Village, Ill: American Academy of Pediatrics;2003:180-182, 328-340, 360-382 Needlestick injuries, also called percu- taneous injuries, are an occupationalhazard for all health care workers. Asidefrom the injury itself, there is the risk ofexposure to blood-borne infections, specically hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitisC (HCV), and human immunodeciencyvirus (HIV). The risk of contracting anyillness depends on several factors, in-cluding the status of the source, thenature of the injury, the infectivity ofthe agent, and the effectiveness ofpostexposure management. Injuries in which the source patient is known to be HBV- and HIV-negative do not require specic treatment be-yond that of the wound itself. When thesource patient is known to be positivefor an infectious agent, the health careworker must seek postexposure prophy-laxis immediately. When the sourcepatient's status is unknown, the healthcare worker still should seek postexpo-sure prophylaxis, but also should invokeprocedures to assess the source's sta-tus. Revealing a patient's HIV statusmay need the patient's consent, al- though some states allow that informa-tion to be released to exposed individ-uals. Testing patients may require theirconsent, and each institution shouldhave procedures in place to obtaintesting quickly when possible. There are few studies on the rate of HIV serocon-version related to the medical status ofthe source patient, although the viralload and degree of illness do affect thepostexposure prophylaxis regimen. The nature of the injury is impor- tant. Deep injuries carry greater riskthan supercial injuries, as do thosecaused by hollow-bore needles versus cutting needles. The agents themselvesvary in their infectivity. HBV is highlyinfectious, with a seroconversion rateafter a known of 37% to 62%.In contrast, the seroconversion rate ofHCV is 1.8%. is the least infectious,with an estimated seroconversion rateof 0.3% after a known percutaneous exposure. Exposed individuals as well as those who might have been exposed mustseek postexposure treatment immedi-ately; all institutions need to providefor that contingency. The wound shouldbe washed with soap and water; thereis no added benet of any other decon-tamination of the wound. For those who have not received HBV vaccinationor who have not responded to vaccina-tion, exposure to HBV is treated with adose of HBV immune globulin (0.06 mL/kg) within 24 hours and initiation ofthe HBV vaccine series. There is noprophylaxis for HCV. For exposure toHIV or likely HIV, treatment must beginas soon as possible, preferably within2 hours and no later than 24 to36 hours. If the exposure was with asolid needle or supercial and the HIV source is asymptomatic or has a knownlow viral load, treatment is with atwo-drug regimen using two nucleosideanalogs (zidovudine and lamivudine) for4 weeks. When the exposure is severeor the source has symptomatic HIVdisease or a high viral load, treatment is with the two nucleoside analogs plus aprotease inhibitor (nelnavir), also for4 weeks. If the source has HIV and thereis a question of resistance or if morethan 36 hours have passed since expo-sure, an HIV expert should be consulted.Counseling must be available within72 hours, as must ongoing monitoringfor prophylaxis adherence, potential adverse effects, and serial antibodytesting. The prophylaxis regimens forboth HBV and HIV can be used inpregnant women. Clearly, prevention is the best man- agement for any injury. All health careworkers should be immunized againstHBV and subsequently tested for re- sponse to the immunization. Appropri-ate safety measures and proceduresmust be observed at all times whenhandling needles. A list of safety de-vices is maintained at the NationalAssociation for the Primary Preventionof Sharps Injuries Web site (www.nappsi.org/safety.shtml). Daniel Rauch, MD Albert Einstein College of MedicineJacobi Medical CenterBronx, NY Comment: Unfortunately, needle- stick injury is an occupational hazardand a hazard for individuals in thecommunity injured from discarded nee-dles. For community needlestick inju-ries, the risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens is related to theprevalence rate of infections in the community and the ability of potentialpathogens to survive on fomites. Man-agement includes acute wound care,consideration of prophylactic manage-ment, and prevention. in brief 74Pediatrics in Review Vol.25 No.2 February 2004 by Susan Guralnick on July 7, 2009 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org Downloaded from Depending on the immunization status of the patient, tetanus toxoid and tetanus immune globulin should beconsidered. As with occupational injury,HBV, HCV, and HIV are the blood-borne pathogens of concern. HBV can surviveon fomites for several days. The pa-tient's hepatitis B immunization status should be reviewed when use of HBVvaccine and hepatitis B immune glob-ulin are considered. HIV often is a greatworry in cases of community needle-stick injuries. The risk of HIV transmis-sion is believed to be low, and the United States Public Health Servicedoes not recommend for or against prophylaxis in this setting (CDC. Man-agement of possible sexual, injecting-drug-use, or other nonoccupational ex-posure to HIV, including considerations related to antiretroviral therapy: setting are controversial and mustbe individualized. Follow-up testingshould include testing at 6 months;some also test 6 and 12 weeks after injury. The risk for transmission of HCVis low because of poor viability on fomites. Public health programs on safe nee- dle disposal and needle exchange pro-grams (exchanging drug users 'used syringes and needles for sterile needles) are important prevention efforts. TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics sup-ports needle exchange programs inconjunction with drug treatment. Tina L.

Elk Grove Village, Ill: American Academy of Pediatrics;2003:275 -280 Escherichia coli is an important human pathogen that causes both in flamma- tory and nonin flammatory diarrhea. En- teropathogenic and enterotoxigenic E coli infection usually presents with acute watery diarrhea without dysen- tery; infection with enteroinvasive andenterohemorrhagic forms usually present as invasive gastroenteritis, of-ten with grossly bloody stools. Entero-pathogenic E coli is a cause of chronic diarrhea that can lead to growth retar-dation in neonates and childrenyounger than 2 years of age. Entero-toxigenic forms can cause infantile di-arrhea and traveler 's diarrhea in all ages and is usually self-limited. Entero-invasive forms are clinically similar toShigella infections and can present with watery diarrhea, usually withoutblood or mucus, but stools can containfecal leukocytes. Enteroaggregative E coli causes acute or chronic watery diarrhea, predominantly among infantsin the developing world. Enterohemor- rhagic E coli O157:H7 causes hemor- rhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). E coli O157:H7 produces a toxin known as Shiga toxin or verocytotoxinthat is capable of inhibiting protein synthesis and causing cell injury anddeath. It was recognized initially as apathogen in 1983 in the stools of chil-dren who had HUS and soon thereafter was linked epidemiologically with con-sumption of hamburger meat. The or-ganism produces a lactose-fermentingnonmucoid colony on MacConkey agarand is identi ed by its failure to fer- ment sorbitol. Only 50% of clinicalmicrobiology laboratories in the UnitedStates screen for E coli O157:H7. There- fore, if it is suspected clinically, thephysician should request speci c detec- tion of the organism, so appropriatemedia will be used by the laboratory.The incubation period for infection is2 to 7 days. It has been associated withfoods of animal origin (including under-cooked hamburger, unpasteurized cowand goat milk, roast beef, deer jerky), fresh produce (lettuce, apple cider, sprouts), and contaminated municipaland recreational water. The organismhas a low infectious dose ( /H11021300 organ- isms), which contributes to the propen-sity for person-to-person spread. The clinical presentation of E coli O157:H7 infection consists of 24 to 48 hours of nonbloody diarrhea thatin brief Pediatrics in Review Vol.25 No.2 February 2004 75 by Susan Guralnick on July 7, 2009 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org Downloaded from subsequently converts to bloody stools. Prediarrheal signs include a self-limitedfever, abdominal pain (intermittent,spasmodic), headache, myalgias, vomit-ing, and irritability. The fever rarely is present after stools become bloody,which can help distinguish this fromother infections. The differential diag-nosis should include intussusception,inflammatory colitis, and appendicitis. Fecal leukocytes are present variably inthis infection and should not be arelevant diagnostic consideration. HUS is de ned as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hematocrit /H1102130% [0.30] with [150 /H11003109/L]), and renal dysfunction (cre- atinine higher than the upper limit of normal for age). It occurs, on average,4 to 8 days after the onset of diarrheain about 5% to 15% of children in- fected with E coli O157:H7. The mor- tality rate for children who developHUS is 3% to 5%. Studies have shownthat antibiotic treatment of patientsinfected with this organism increasesthe risk of developing HUS. No bene t in terms of decreased symptoms, short-ened duration of illness, or rate ofcomplications has been shown for an- tibiotic treatment. Some antimicrobialdrugs are potent inducers of the ex-pression of the Shiga toxin gene. Suchan action might increase the level oftoxin in the intestine, thereby increas-ing the amount of toxin absorbed intocirculation and, thus, increasing the riskof HUS. Treatment of children infected with E coli O157:H7 is primarily supportive. Dehydration and electrolyte abnormal-ities should be corrected. Antimotilityagents, anticholinergic agents, or opi-oid narcotics that slow intestinal peri-stalsis should not be administered be-cause they have been associated with alonger duration of bloody diarrhea andan increased risk of developing HUS. Careful follow-up of patients who havehemorrhagic colitis, including measure-ment of a complete blood count, bloodurea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, isrecommended to detect HUS early. Ifpatients have no evidence of hemolysis,nephropathy, or thrombocytopenia by3 days after the diarrhea resolves, therisk of developing HUS is low. Children infected with enterohemorrhagic E coli should not be permitted to re-enter anychild care center until the diarrhea isresolved and two stool cultures arenegative for E coli O157:H7. Preventive measures include cooking all groundbeef thoroughly until no pink meatremains and no ingestion of raw milk or unpasteurized apple juice products.Strict attention to handwashing andhygiene also is important to preventcontinued transmission. Nicole Shilkofski, MD Johns Hopkins Children's CenterBaltimore, MD Comment: Infection by enterohem- orrhagic E coli is reportable under United States reporting requirements determined collaboratively by theCouncil of State and Territorial Epide-miologists (CSTE) and the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC).Other reporting requirements for food-borne diseases and conditions parasitic conditions such as cryptosporidiosis,cyclosporiasis, and trichinosis. In the United States, state and ter- ritorial laws and regulations may man-date additional requirements. Speci c state reporting requirements are avail-able from the ). Clinicians usually report to local or state health departments. Reportingshould include potential food-borne ill-nesses, such as when two or more patients present with similar symptomsthat may have resulted from the inges-tion of a common food. Environmentalcontamination also has been suggested,with a recent E coli O157 outbreak at a county fair where there was no impli- cating food or beverage source, but the organism was isolated in a building(JAMA . 2003;290:2709 -2712). County fairs have been recognized increasinglyas settings for infection because ofclose contact between animals and hu-mans. In addition, physicians shouldreport noticeable increases in unusualillnesses, symptom complexes, or dis-ease patterns even without de nitive diagnosis. Prompt reporting can allowpublic authorities to initiate an epide-miologic investigation earlier thanwould be possible if the report awaiteddenitive etiologic diagnosis. Rapid re- porting of enterohemorrhagic E coli infection is critical to prevent furtherdisease. Tina L.
