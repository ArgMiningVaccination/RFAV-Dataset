Ceramic substrates, as used in this entry, does not include ceramic materials containing 5 % by weight, or greater, clay or cement content, either as separate constituents or in combination. Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:a. chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modifi- cation coating process wherein a metal, alloy, \"composite \", dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on thesubstrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process maybe provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or \"laser\" irradiation. N.B. 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition(CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes. N.B. 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. N.B. 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cemen- tation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contactwith the powder mixture. b. thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coatingmaterial. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of theevaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use ofmonitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:1. electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating; 2. ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species; 3.\"laser\"Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave \"laser\"beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating; 4. cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. Theanode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode,through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition. N.B.: This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates. 5. ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive2007R1183 \u2014EN\u201421.11.2007 \u2014000.001 \u2014100B species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process. c. pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of: 1. the metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); 2. an activator (normally a halide salt); and 3. an inert powder, most frequently alumina.The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1 030 K (757 \u00b0C) and 1 375 K (1 102 \u00b0C) for sufficient time todeposit the coating. d. plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon anintegrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either lowpressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying. N.B. 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure. N.B. 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 \u00b0C) at 0,1 MPa. e. slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended ina liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. f. sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electricfield towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate. N.B. 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coatingmaterials. N.B. 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition. g. ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionised, accelerated through a potential gradientand implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includesprocesses in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter Systems, Equipment and Components Note 1: the control status of equipment and components described in 3A001 or 3A002, other than those described in3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.10. or 3A001.a.12., which arespecially designed for or which have the same functional characteristics as other equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.

Note: 3A232 does not control detonators using only primary explosives, such as lead azide. Technical note: In 3A232 the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire or foil) that explosively vapourises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. Innonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical deto-nation in a contacting high-explosive material such as PETN (Pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vapourisation of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapperacross a gap and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts achemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by a magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator. Also, the word initiatoris sometimes used in place of the word detonator. 3A233 Mass spectrometers, other than those specified in 0B002.g., capable of measuring ions of 230 atomic mass units or greater and having a resolution of better than 2 parts in 230, as follows, and ion sourcestherefor: a. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP/MS);b. spectrometers (GDMS);c. thermal ionization mass spectrometers (TIMS);
