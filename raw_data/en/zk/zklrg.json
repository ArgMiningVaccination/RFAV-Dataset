Mustafa and Tami Gurley -Calvez (lead Corriveau, Ellerbeck, Laura Mussulman, Caitlin Smith, Christian Dodg e, Jack Beal, Ian Thompson and Akinlolu Ojo. Weekly Overview This digest updates every Tuesday to inform healthcare providers, hospitals leadership, policymakers and the public on issues related to the coronavirus pandemic. The Daily COVID -19 Digest includes information about : (A) Pandemic Status (B) Face Masks (C) Tracking, Anticipating Spread and Hospitalizations (D) Pharmacologic Treatment of COVID -19 (E) Vaccine development (F) Relevant Government Actions (G) Other Relevant Developments 2 Key Highlights Nationally, COVID -19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to decrease. In Kansas, new reported cases and hospital admissions are also decreasing. There was a slight increase in new reported deaths over the past week, driven by the Wichita metro area. New hospital admissions currently average 31 per day. Vaccine availability varies by county. Details about vaccine distribution can be found here . A. Pandemic Status Pandemic Status * (as of March 7, 2022 ) Location Confirmed cases Deaths The University of Kansas Health System ** 26,688 500 Sedgwick county 144,521 131 Leavenworth county 19,227 174 Butler county 18,780 167 Reno county 18,462 219 Saline county 14,067 230 Riley county 13,400 81 Crawford county 11,834 128 Finney county 11,504 106 Ford county 10,582 108 Cowley county 10,057 147 Lyon county 9,926 115 Harvey county 9,516 117 Montgomery county 9,387 141 Geary county 9,182 73 McPherson county 7,905 124 Miami county 87 Ellis county 80 *KS counties > 7000 cases, **TUKHS had a total of 4,814 hospital admissions 3 B. Face Masks , physical distancing , and vaccine updates Extended Dosing Interval for mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines : On February 24, 2022, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) released Interim clinical considerations fo r the use of COVID -19 vaccines currently approved or authorized in the United States . In the guidance, the CDC suggested considering an eight- week interval between the first and second doses of the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines for some individuals 12 years of age and older, especially for males 12 to 39 years of age. The consideration to extend the dosing interval is aimed to potentially reduce the risk for myocarditis in these populations. However, the CDC added that a shorter interval between the first and second doses remains the recommended interval for: people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised; adults ages 65 years and older; and others who need rapid protection due to increased concern about community transmission or risk of severe disease. FDA authorizes revisions to Evusheld dosing : On February 24, 2022, the US food and drug administration (FDA) has revised the dosing of E vusheld (tixa gevimab co-packaged with cilgavimab increase dose for the preexposure prophylaxis of COVID -19 in certain adults and pediatric patients. Under the revised authorization , the FDA has increased the initial authorized dose to 300mg of tixagevim ab and 300mg of cilgavimab. The revision was based on recent information indicating that the previously authorized Evusheld dose ma y be less active against the Omicron variant of COVI D-19. C. Tracking , Anticipating Spread and Hospitalizations Projected local spread : As of March 7, 2022 the updated predictions based on a v ariety of widely used model s for COVID -19 pandemics suggest that: S urveillance of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is essential to ensure accurate understanding of the current state of the pandemic and the effect of behavioral and policy effects on disease spread. COVID -19 related death is the most robustly reported data point but is a lagging indicator of about 4 -6 weeks after any change in behavior . Hospitalizations are also lagging indicators of disease spread. 4 Green lines indicate actual events and blue lines indicate calculated events based on actual data of the number of cases. Estimates of hospital admissions (Kansas City metro area, Wichita metro area, and Kansas locations outside of the Kansas City and Wichita metro a reas) and hospitalizations (all locations) are excluded because they are based on assumptions from new case estimates instead of actual data. The link between new cases and new hospital admissions is increasingly unclear. Detailed notes about graphs: Data accessed : March 7, 2022 at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data and at https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus- covid -19-spread -map/ . The shape of the data driven prediction is determined by existing data from other states and locations that are ahead of KS in regard to the pandemic. A major limitation of using this model is that we cannot forecast the effects of events (e.g. Memorial Day) that happen concurrently across locations. 5 D. Pharmacologic Treatment of COVID -19 On February 3, 2022 the Infectious Disease Society of America updated their Guidelines o n the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID -19. see Gr aphic, below). 6 7 8 KU researchers are collaborating with leaders in guideline development around the world to summarize existing recommendations in a living recommendation map for COVID -19. Check the eCOVID19 RecMap E. Vaccine development and distribution Vaccine availability varies in different counties. Details about vaccine distribution can be found here. Vaccine distribution per KDHE data as March 7, 2022 , are shown below 9 F. Relevant legislative actions On January 6, 2022, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly reinstates COVID -19 state of emergency. Kansas has seen a 146% increase in COVID -19 cases in the first two weeks of January , a 17% increase in hospitalizations and a 15% increase in deaths. More than half of the positive cases sequenced by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment were om icron. G. Other Relevant Developments Testing T he CDC has released guidance on Antigen testing for COVID-19, with revisions January 18 , 2022 (see Graphic, below). 10 Update This is a living document. Information in this document will need to be revised and updated in the near future. We will conduct ongoing reviews of the available evidence and continuously monitor the data to determine if information require modification. Ba sed on the rapidly evolving nature of this pandemic, information will likely need to be updated daily. This document is not intended to establish clinical practice guidelines or the standard of care. Physicians should exercise their own clinical judgement in the care of individual patients.

Procedures like surgery, endoscopy or bronchoscopy can also lead to aerosolization and subsequent airborne transmission.1 Human-to -human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develo p.2 Data related to the spread of SARS -CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that healthcare personnel are at higher risk of infection than the general population.3,4 Several types of PPE are available and summarized below. The WHO has issued guidance on the use of PPE, following a three- pronged strategy: (1) minimize the need for PPE, (2) ensure PPE use is rational and appropriate, and (3) coordina te PPE supply chain management mechanisms.5 WHO has developed recommendations for PPE use.5 KUHS Infection Prevention has developed similar, parallel, recommendations. Personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care personal and patients in the hospital PPE for healthcare personnel is needed to protect both individual providers and the healthcare system itself. Ina dequate PPE supply may result in sho rtage of healthcare personnel due to infection and/or quarantine. Infected healthcare personnel may also act as a vector for transmission to patients. Hospitals and healthcare systems, including the University of Kansas Health System, face challenges in projecting PPE requirements and availability. Projections of future health system PPE use follow projections for total number of persons under investigation ( PUIs ) or contracts hospitalized, and I CU patients, emphasizing the urgency of reliable projections.
