At the Center for Integrative Medicine we refer to experienced and licensed/certified integrative healers whose care embraces the health and wellbeing of the whole individual. Roll over the images below to see all we have to offer Functional Testing and Therapeutic Exercise Integrative Energy Medicine Nutrition Counseling and Life Coaching Evaluations are done to determine areas of decreased strength and/or flexibility which over time could lead to injury or loss of function. Patients are then educated in simple exercises they can do to improve function and reduce the risk of injury or impairment. We tend to feel and heal best when our energy is flowing optimally and we are in balance. Integrative energy Medicine (IEM) is performed by a certified practitioner who 'listens' into the subtle energies of the chakras and energy fields surrounding the client. The practitioner assesses where energy is not flowing optimally due to trauma, illness or stressors. Work is then done by the practitioner to improve energy flow and restore balance to maximize the body's ability to heal itself. Patients undergo a nutritional assessment of their current diet and work with a certified nutritional expert to determine how to make healthy changes. Coaching is also available to address how emotions play an intricate role in our eating habits. Improving our nutrition and managing our emotions and response to life stressors is good for the body and the soul! Founded by Mikao Usui in Japan, Reiki is a technique used to help increase the energy flowing within us to help us feel more relaxed and at peace. We tend to feel our best and most healthy when our energy is flowing optimally. Reiki is spiritual, but does not subscribe to any religious affiliation. Performed by a certified massage therapist, the massage is focused on problem areas the patient would like addressed as well as other areas determined by the therapist to need attention. Massage helps to improve flexibility and loosen tight muscles which can be related to injuries or how the body holds on to stress and tension. The goal may be overall relaxation which is also extremely therapeutic. "}
