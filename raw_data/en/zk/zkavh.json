Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting millions worldwide. While there is no cure for atopic dermatitis, acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve symptoms and quality of life. How Acupuncture and Acupressure Work Acupuncture and acupressure are based on the principle of qi, which is the life energy that flows through the body. It is believed that when this energy is blocked or out of balance, it can lead to disease. Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body, known as acupuncture points or acupoints. It is thought that this can help to unblock qi and restore balance. Acupressure is similar to acupuncture but does not involve the use of needles. Instead, pressure is applied to specific points on the body using the hands, elbows, or feet. Acupuncture and Acupressure for Eczema Acupuncture and acupressure have been used to treat eczema for centuries. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners believe that eczema is caused by an imbalance of energy in the body. They believe that acupuncture can help to restore balance and improve circulation. This, in turn, can help to reduce inflammation and promote healing. The Benefits of Acupuncture for Eczema Acupuncture is thought to help ease eczema symptoms in a few different ways. It can help to increase circulation and reduce inflammation, which may help to reduce itchiness. Acupuncture may also help improve the immune system's function and improve your ability to fight off infection. There is some [ evidence](https://actamedicaphilippina.upm.edu.ph/index.php/acta/article/download/3226/2608/) that acupuncture may help improve the skin's barrier function and reduce water loss. Acupuncture is thought to activate the release of endorphins, which can help to relieve pain and reduce stress. What to Consider Before Trying Acupuncture for Eczema There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to try acupuncture for eczema may vary depending on the individual's symptoms and medical history. However, some things to consider before attempting acupuncture for eczema include: - Consult with a qualified acupuncturist. Acupuncture is a relatively new treatment option, and not all practitioners are experienced in using it for eczema. Before starting any treatment, it is important to speak with a qualified acupuncturist to ensure that the treatment is appropriate for your specific symptoms and condition. - Be aware of potential side effects.

Before starting any acupuncture treatment, be sure to discuss any side effects with your practitioner. Some common side effects of acupuncture include pain, tingling, and warmth. - Be patient. Acupuncture is not a quick fix, and it may take several sessions to see any improvement in your symptoms. Be patient and allow the treatment to work its magic. - Follow up with your practitioner. After starting acupuncture for eczema, follow up with your practitioner to ensure that the treatment is working and discuss any possible side effects.
