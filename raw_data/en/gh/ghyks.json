Adam Blanning, MD Dr. Blanning is the founder of The Denver Center for Anthroposophic Therapies in downtown Denver, CO. Exciting new work is coming for Dr. Blanning in the next year... In addition to Dr. Blanning's work in the office, seeing people for appointments and doing phone or zoom consultations, he has also been very active teaching, organizing trainings, writing and coordinating with colleagues in other countries. That work has steadily grown over the last 7-10 years. Out of that work, it was recently announced that starting in September 2023 Dr. Blanning has been selected for (and accepted) a 40% time role of directing and coordinating activities related to anthroposophic medicine worldwide. He will join two European colleagues as a co-leader for the medical section work that happens at the Goetheanum, the international center for anthroposophic activity. What does that mean? - Blanning will be doing more traveling and teaching! He will still be in the office half time, but will need to go to Europe about four times a year. - There will likely be other travel, too, to places like South America, Asia, or Australia/New Zealand. - That shift is still more than a year away, and there will be plenty of notice about any other changes association with this new work. Mostly, it will ask for more flexibility and a little advanced planning when setting up appointments... The main goal for this new task is to help strengthen and support the practice and availability of anthroposophic medicine in many communities, in all part of the world. That seems worth striving for!

[Website](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/go-in-peace-transform-a-veteran-s-life-film) Light Therapy Helios Center for Therapeutic Arts PAAM - Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine Dear friends and colleagues, As we mentioned in December, the FDA recently released a Revised Draft Guidance on Homeopathy in late October 2019 ( [click here to read it](https://faustbranch.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a624b710a1eab21e1f958b748&id=5e3a7c8bcb&e=1239859603)). Although the new October 2019 guidance has some helpful changes, it also has some detrimental ones. Unfortunately, the detrimental ones are very detrimental, and those of us who want to protect the future of homeopathy in America must now pressure the FDA to revise this guidance considerably. The homeopathic community, including PAAM, continues to be in dialogue with legal counsel and with the FDA, but is essential that we have a 180-day extension in order to respond adequately to the FDA. More time is needed to analyze the complex legal and policy matters arising from this latest guidance so that we can respond appropriately and completely. If the current Draft Guidance is approved by the FDA, it will mean the end of the availability of many low-potency remedies used in Anthroposophic Medicine and homeopathy. It will risk the elimination of non-oral and non-topical remedies that are often used in anthroposophic medicine. The Revised Draft Guidance also gives too broad of discretionary powers that would allow the FDA to designate any homeopathic remedy \"high risk\" and can require that the remedy be considered a non-FDA-approved new drug that would then require an expensive and unlikely drug-approval process. That means that when the FDA removes a homeopathic remedy from the market, it will be the equivalent of banning it forever. Those who believe they will simply be able to order homeopathic remedies from abroad will be in for a rude surprise. The FDA will stop shipments of homeopathic remedies that have been effectively banned in the United States at the border. Please take action today by reading through [this updated letter from Americans for Homeopathic Choice](https://faustbranch.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a624b710a1eab21e1f958b748&id=b43f519bb4&e=1239859603), which contains a link to a newly-updated comment form ( [the link is also provided here](https://faustbranch.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a624b710a1eab21e1f958b748&id=d7d1a21cee&e=1239859603)). Even if you have already made a comment to the FDA, please comment again using this updated form. Once you follow the link you can use the ready-made comments provided, you can compose your own comments, or you can combine the provided comments with your own, just as long as your voice is heard by the FDA, Congress, the Vice President and the President. So far we've generated 24,000 comments, but we need two to three times that, so please, submit another comment using the link above, before January 23rd, and forward this email to everyone you know, encouraging them to also take action. Thank you for your attention and support!

This experiential webinar led by the faculty of AAP's Anthroposophic Psychotherapy Certification Program will guide us into mutual exploration of these nuanced processes. Motion and Emotion September 24th, 2022, 10:30am-12:00pm ET Explore the relationship between movement and emotion in this experiential webinar led by Alex Schneider, LMHC. Somatic work is an important piece in a truly integrative psychotherapy. Explore how movement and embodiment foster growth and healing, and how somatic work can be integrated into the psychotherapeutic process. Includes Spacial Dynamics exercises. The Pedagogical Law in Therapeutic Relationships October 22nd, 2022, 10:30am-12:30pm ET Relationships are the primary psychological context of human life, as well as the source of much healing that occurs in therapy. In this webinar with participatory elements, Susan Overhauser, Ph.D., will lead us through a look at various relationships, considering how the four sheaths (physical, etheric, astral, \"I\") impact relational partners. The primary focus will be on understanding the psychotherapeutic relationship. Soul-Care for the Therapist December 3rd, 2022, 10:30am-12:00pm ET In its essence, psychotherapy is the art of healing the soul. As psychotherapists, we care for the soul of the other. However, compassion fatigue and burnout are prevalent among healthcare practitioners. How does our profession impact our own soul life, and how do we care for it? This webinar will be led by Zheni Nasi, M.A., R.P. (Qualifying) with direct input from participants. To enliven our conversation, we ask that you send by November 18 a question and a soul-care practice you (may) have to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1776737a7e79577679637f657867786478677f7e7467646e747f787b78706e39786570). Understanding the Consequences of Rejected Cosmic Sacrifice February 4th, 2023, 10:30am-12:00pm ET Tonya Stoddard, LCSW, will lead us through a participatory imaginative journey exploring how cosmic evolutionary sequences led certain beings to be held back in their development and the consequences of these sacrifices and rejections for human psychology. One result is an ever-deepening experience of egoism that has become the foundation for the incarnation of our I and its health and dysregulation. An additional event will take place in January 2023: Creating a Community of Anthroposophic Psychotherapists January 14th, 2023, 10:00am-12:30pm ET Anthroposophic psychotherapy is a growing international movement gaining ground in North America. This gathering serves as an opportunity for therapists who work out of anthroposophy to meet one another and share ideas about how we can support each other and the development of anthroposophic psychotherapy. Participants will have a chance to introduce themselves and their professional work to the group. A discussion will follow touching on many topics including the needs of practitioners, potential forms of collaboration, avenues for certification, and ways in which the Association for Anthroposophic Psychology can be of service. This no-fee online gathering will not be recorded. We look forward to meeting with you online! | | Susan Overhauser, Ph.D. For the Anthroposophic Psychotherapy Certification Program Faculty Association for Anthroposophic Psychology | | Photo credit to Nina.
