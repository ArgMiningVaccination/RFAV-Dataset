It is possible to detox our bodies from much of the toxicity we carry, gently, using homeopathy and homeobotanicals. Although detoxing can in itself be beneficial to our health, often we find that after a detox the way is cleared for other treatments to be more effective. It may be apparent from your medical timeline what will be necessary to detox, but some toxicity may be hidden, such as heavy metals. In this case I use Heavy Metal Toxicity Hair Testing to assess your toxic load and prescribe the appropriate detox based on these results. \" Karrie \" Sam \" I am so grateful for this change in my life..I don't remember the last time I felt normal for such a long period of time.. I am honestly so excited to see how my mind and body develop now that both are finally in peace and feeling good. I would highly recommend contacting Carolyn if you see yourself in any of the above. I had really given up and just accepted my daily struggles, but thank god I gave it another shot - otherwise nothing would ever have changed. Thank "}
