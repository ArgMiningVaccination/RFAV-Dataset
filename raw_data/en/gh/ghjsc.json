Accurate, disease-specific mortality prediction is needed to inform shared decision-making with patients and their families around the patients' goals of care. Disease-specific mortality prediction can also allow health care systems to allocate resources in the most transparent, objective and fair manner possible to save as many lives as possible and facilitate timely access to palliative care, if needed.3-5The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score to predict death among nonpalliative patients with COVID-19 presenting to emergency departments: a derivation and validation study Corinne M.

DOI:10.9778/cmajo.20210243Background: Predicting mortality from COVID-19 using information available when patients present to the emergency department can inform goals-of-care decisions and assist with ethical allocation of critical care resources. The study objective was to develop and validate a clinical score to predict emergency department and in-hospital mortality among consecutive nonpalliative patients with COVID-19; in this study, we define palliative patients as those who do not want resuscitative measures, such as intubation, intensive care unit care or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: This derivation and validation study used observational cohort data recruited from 46 hospitals in 8 Canadian provinces participating in the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN). We included adult (age 18 yr) nonpalliative patients with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department of a participating site between Mar. 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021. We randomly assigned hospitals to derivation or validation, and prespecified clinical variables as candidate predictors. We used logistic regression to develop the score in a derivation cohort and examined its performance in predicting emergency department and in-hospital mortality in a validation cohort. Results: Of 8761 eligible patients, 618 (7.0%) died. The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score included age, sex, type of residence, arrival mode, chest pain, severe liver disease, respiratory rate and level of respiratory support. The area under the curve was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.93) in derivation and 0.92 CI 0.90-0.93) in validation. The score had excellent calibration. These results suggest that scores of 6 or less would categorize patients as being at low risk for in-hospital death, with a negative predictive value of 99.9%. Patients in the low-risk group had an in-hospital mortality rate of 0.1%. Patients with a score of 15 or higher had an observed mortality rate of 81.0%. Interpretation: The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score is a simple score that can be used for level-of-care discussions with patients and in situations of critical care resource constraints to accurately predict death using variables available on emergency department arrival. The score was derived and validated mostly in unvaccinated patients, and before variants of concern were circulating widely and newer treatment regimens implemented in Canada. Study registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04702945AbstractResearch CMAJ OPEN, 10(1) E91 ResearchNumerous models have been developed to predict mortal- ity from COVID-19, but most are at high risk of bias.6-8 Many were developed in small or nonrepresentative patient samples; enrolled patients from early in the pandemic, before evidence-based treatments had been identified; included pal- liative patients (i.e., those who do not want resuscitative mea- sures, such as intubation, intensive care unit care or cardio- pulmonary resuscitation); censored outcomes; and had moderate predictive performance.6 The ISARIC 4C Mortal- ity Score is the strongest model developed.9 However, it includes palliative patients, which limits its utility in stratify- ing risk among nonpalliative patients with COVID-19. In addition, the ISARIC 4C Mortality Score was developed based on data from early in the pandemic. Most other pub- lished rules involve the use of imaging or laboratory tests,9-14 which precludes their use as a first-line triage tool in the emergency department, where decisions on the appropriate- ness of intubation and mechanical ventilation may have to be made on arrival. Our objective in the present study was to develop and vali- date a clinical score that accurately predicts mortality among nonpalliative patients with COVID-19, using clinical variables that are readily available on emergency department arrival. Methods Study design and setting This study is a derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule based on observational data. Model development and reporting followed TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) standards.15 Our protocol is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04702945). Study setting The Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) is an ongoing multicentre pan-Canadian registry that enrols consecutive eligible patients with COVID-19 presenting to emergency departments in hos- pitals located in 8 of the 10 Canadian provinces, including the 4 most populous (only Prince Edward Island and Newfound- land and Labrador are not represented).16 The network con- ducts observational studies and develops clinical decision rules to inform emergency department care.17-19 The CCEDRRN patient engagement committee reviewed and provided input into the development of the research question, the choice of outcomes and the study protocol, and reviewed the submitted manuscript. Patient partners were involved in developing CCEDRRN's website and knowledge translation tools to dis- seminate study results (https://www.ccedrrn.com/). Participants Participating sites needed to show at least 99% compliance in enrolling consecutive eligible patients for their data to be included in this study. At each site, we used trackers employ- ing medical microbiology lists of all tested patients to identify all eligible patients. A national coordinator reviewed the lists of all sites on a weekly basis to ensure compliance. We included data from 46 of 50 CCEDRRN sites that met this criterion by the time of the data cut (Appendix 1, Table S1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/10/1/E90/suppl/DC1). The characteristics, resource use and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 included in the registry are posted as a preprint.20 We included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department of a participating site between Mar. 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021. We defined con - firmed COVID-19 as disease in patients who presented with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms and a positive result of a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 obtained within 14 days before their arrival in the emergency department or after their arrival, which reflects the maximal incubation period.21 This allowed us to capture patients who were diagnosed in the community and subsequently presented to the emergency department, and those with early false- negative test results that became positive. We also included patients who presented with COVID-19 symptoms and were diagnosed with \"confirmed COVID-19\" to capture patients who were transferred to a CCEDRRN hospital and whose NAAT at the sending site could not be confirmed, and patients who were presumed by treating clinicians to have COVID-19 despite persistently negative NAAT results. We excluded patients less than 18 years of age and those whose goals of care precluded invasive mechanical ventilation in order to not bias the study with self-fulfilling prophecy bias,22 whereby the prognostic model predicts the outcome that occurred as a result of a decision to withhold life-sustaining measures.22-24 We also excluded patients transferred to a hospi- tal outside of CCEDRRN, as we would have been unable to ascertain their outcomes. We followed patients for 30 days if they were discharged from the emergency department or until hospital discharge if their stay lasted longer than 30 days. Data sources Trained research assistants abstracted data from electronic and paper-based medical records into a central, Web-based REDCap database. They captured patient demographic char- acteristics, vital signs, symptoms, comorbidities, COVID-19 exposure risk, diagnostic test results and outcomes. The research assistants recorded the first set of vital signs and symptoms documented in the emergency department record. The lowest oxygen saturation level was the lowest level recorded in the emergency department or by paramedics (some sites transcribed the vital signs obtained in the ambu- lance into their triage forms) with the patient receiving oxy- gen. We abstracted code status from the patients' medical records. If a patient's code status was not documented, we assumed that the status was full code. We evaluated the interrater agreement of key predictor variables by comparing data collected retrospectively with prospective data.16 We developed the clinical prediction score after all chart abstraction was complete; research assistants were thus unaware of which clinical variables would be candi- date predictor variables.E92 CMAJ OPEN, 10(1) ResearchOutcome The primary outcome was all-cause emergency department and in-hospital mortality. All patients had complete follow-up data at the time of the data cut. We categorized patients who were discharged from hospital as alive according to their latest hospital admission. Predictor variables All candidate predictor variables were recorded in the emer- gency department record. We selected candidate predictor variables based on a literature review of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, review of other COVID-19 risk- prediction models, the availability of candidate predictor vari- ables on patient arrival and the clinical knowledge of the investigator team.9,10,12,13,25-29 The candidate predictor vari- ables included age, sex, pregnancy, type of residence, mode of arrival at the emergency department, comorbidities, symp- toms, heart rate on arrival, systolic blood pressure, oxygen sat- uration level, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, oxygen delivery in the emergency department, lowest oxygen saturation level, physician or nurse impression of respiratory distress, and use of alcohol, tobacco, vaping or illicit sub- stances (Appendix 1, Table S2). Statistical analysis Sample size Assuming an event rate of less than 10%, shrinkage of 0.9 and a conservative Cox-Snell r2 of 0.1, we estimated that 8.5 events per degree of freedom were required for reliable prediction modelling in the derivation cohort.30 The 42 candi- date predictor variables had 49 degrees of freedom, which indicated that 417 events were required. In the derivation cohort, there were 6758 patients who made 7420 emergency department visits. The derivation cohort had 471 events, which exceeded the number of events required. Model development and validation We randomly assigned participating sites to derivation or vali- dation, with the goal of assigning 75% of eligible patients and outcome events to derivation, and the remaining to validation. We examined candidate predictors for collinearity and miss- ing and extreme values in the derivation cohort. A few vari- ables had missing values (systolic blood pressure had the most missing, at 4.7%) (Appendix 1, Table S2). We used 5 multiple imputations for predictors if missing categoric data could not reasonably be assumed to be absent (e.g., missing documenta- tion of illicit substance use was classified as no substance use) and used these imputed data sets to develop the final model. The initial logistic regression model considered all candidate predictors, with continuous predictors fit with restricted cubic splines with 3 knots. We assessed the strengths of associations between predictor variables and the outcome using an analysis of variance plot to inform the degrees of freedom to allocate to each predictor. No additional knots were allocated to continuous predictors. We used a fast step-down procedure to reduce the model to key predictors (fastbw function in the R rms package [R Foun- dation for Statistical Computing]). We conducted an internal bootstrap validation with 1000 bootstrap samples to provide an optimism-corrected area under the receiver-operating charac- teristic (AUC). We internal validation sepa - rately for each imputed data set and combined the imputation- specific AUCs using Rubin's rules on the logit scale.31,32 We produced a nomogram from the reduced model to assign points. To enable easy clinical use, we categorized age into decades (as the nomogram points were sensitive to age), and cut points of 20 and 30 for respiratory rate on arrival based on the relation between its spline function and out- come. The resulting score ranged from -1 to 17. We calcu- lated sensitivity and specificity at various point thresholds, along with the score's discrimination and calibration, using one of the imputed data sets. We validated the model in a cohort of geographically dis- tinct sites that were not part of derivation and used a single imputation for the few missing respiratory rates (4%). We assessed outcomes independently for emergency department visits, irrespective of potential subsequent visits leading to death. We performed analyses in R using the rms and pROC packages, and used the pmsampsize package for sample size determination. To ensure patient privacy, a cell size restric- tion policy prohibited reporting counts of less than 5. Validation of previously published models We used our study cohort to externally validate other risk- prediction tools: the SEIMC score,11 the 4C Mortality Score10 and the VACO Index.33 We chose these 3 because they per- formed well in validation yet had critical methodologic differ- ences that limit their translation to emergency department patients with suspected COVID-19: their cohorts included palliative patients, which may have introduced self-fulfilling prophecy bias,22 and they were from early in the pandemic, when COVID-19 testing was restricted to those with severe disease, which may have introduced spectrum bias. To facili- tate comparison with our rule, we calculated their AUCs in our cohort using patients with complete data on as many pre- dictors as possible. We compared AUCs using paired DeLong tests if the complete data for each score had the same patients and unpaired tests if patients with complete data differed by score.34 Ethics approval This study was approved by the research ethics boards of all participating institutions with a waiver of informed consent for enrolment. Results We assessed 9704 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who made 10 670 emergency department visits between Mar. 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021 (Figure 1). We excluded 943 patients who met 1 or more exclusion criteria, and included 8761 patients who made 9605 visits in our analyses. The follow-up time was 30 days for discharged patients and CMAJ OPEN, 10(1) E93 Research30-229 days for admitted patients. Of the 8761 patients, 618 (7.0%) died in the emergency department or hospital. The characteristics and outcomes of patients in the derivation (n = 6758) and validation (n = 2054) cohorts are shown in Table 1. The patients in the derivation cohort made 7420 emer- gency department visits to 32 different sites (Appendix 1, Table S1), and those in the validation cohort made 2185 emergency department visits to 14 different sites. In the derivation cohort, 2705 visits (36.5%) occurred early during the pandemic (between Mar. 1 and June 30, 2020), and 4715 (63.5%) occurred between July 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021. The corresponding values for the validation cohort were 618 (28.3%) and 1567 (71.7%). In derivation, the step-down procedure produced a final model with 8 variables (Table 2). The derived model had an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.92. The resulting risk score ranged from -1 to 17. When the CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score was used as the only predictor in the logistic regression model, the intercept was -9.049, and the slope for the risk score was 0.652 (Table 3). The derivation cohort was well distributed across the score range and had excellent cali- bration (calibration intercept of 0 and slope of 1) and discrim- ination, with an AUC of (Appendix 1, Figure S1).The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score had similar performance in validation. The validation cohort was also dis- tributed across the score ranges, had excellent calibration (cal- ibration intercept of 0 and slope of 1) (AUC 0.92, 95% n = 10 670 (patients n = 9704) Excluded: ED visits n = 1065 , patientsn = 943 Age < 18 yr: ED visits n = 169, patientsn = 160 Palliative code status: ED visits n = 511, patients n = 44 7 Transferred to another hospi talorlong-term care: EDvisitsn = 385, patients n = 336 EDvisits n = 9605 (patientsn = 8761) Derivation dataset 6758*)Validationdataset n = 2185 (patientsn = 2054*) Figure 1: Flow diagram showing included and excluded emergency department (ED) visits. *Numbers total more than 8761 because 51 patients made visits to multiple EDs, some of which were deriva- tion EDs and some of which were validation EDs.Table 1 (part 1 of 2): Characteristics and outcomes of nonpalliative patients with COVID-19 presenting to emergency departments in the derivation and validation cohorts Characteristic/outcomeCohort; no.

These results suggest that a score of 6 or less would categorize patients as being at low risk for in-hospital death, with a negative predictive value of 99.9%. Patients in the low-risk group had an in-hospital mor- tality rate of 0.1%. For scores of 15 or higher, the observed in-hospital mortality rate was 81.0%, and the CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score would categorize patients as being at high risk for in-hospital death, with a specificity of 99.8%. Validation of previously published models The 3 risk scores performed well for the patients with data available, yielding AUCs of nearly 0.88, less than that of the CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score. Unadjusted for multiple testing and with the use of the validation cohort, the AUC for the CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortal- ity Score (n = 2185) was higher than that for the SEIMC score (p = 0.04, n = 1620) and the VACO Index (p = 0.002, n = 2185); there was no evidence of a difference for the 4C Mortality Score (p = 0.07, n = 610) (Appendix 1, Figure S2, Table S5). Interpretation We derived and validated a parsimonious, simple score to pre- dict in-hospital mortality among nonpalliative patients with COVID-19 presenting to emergency departments: the CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score. We found that 8 readily available clinical variables that can be ascertained at the bedside without any diagnostic testing predicted mortality accurately. The score had excellent calibration and discrimi- nation in a geographically distinct cohort of patients who pre- sented to other sites. It can be used as a highly sensitive score to rule out in-hospital mortality in patients at low risk with a score of 6 or less. In patients with a score of 15 or higher, the risk of in-hospital death is very high despite maximum medi- cal therapy. The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score has strengths compared to prior models.6 We developed the model using simple variables that are readily available at the bedside. In contrast to prior models, we excluded patients with palliative goals of care, for whom invasive mechanical ventilation was not offered, to ensure our model did not predict risk of death among patients who were expected to die or were ineligible for the highest level of critical care.9-11,13,14,27,28,33,35,36 This avoids the potential for self- fulfilling prophecy bias.22 Prior models were derived or vali- dated early in the pandemic, when COVID-19 testing was restricted to those with severe disease, and they did not include consecutive eligible patients; both these factors may have resulted in selection bias. The mortality rate in prior studies ranged from 13% to 30%,9,11,12,14,27,28,36 in contrast to 7% in our study. Our study was also able to capture patients who were readmitted to CCEDRRN sites and subsequently died in hospital.Table 1 (part 2 of 2): Characteristics and outcomes of nonpalliative patients with COVID-19 presenting to emergency departments in the derivation and validation cohorts Characteristic/outcomeCohort; no.

CMAJ OPEN, 10(1) E95 ResearchCritically ill patients with COVID-19 typically require aggressive medical management in the emergency department shortly after their arrival. Being able to accurately predict mortality risk before endotracheal intubation can offer the opportunity to have discussions about patients' goals of care and facilitate early high-quality end-of-life care for those most likely to die. Accurate mortality prediction may be essential when surging cases threaten to overwhelm critical care resources. In those rare situations, the CCEDRRN COVID- 19 Mortality Score can guide allocation of scarce resources.Our rule's predictive ability depends mostly on age and respiratory status. The only comorbidity retained in the final model was moderate to severe liver disease. Two other rules also identified liver disease as a risk factor for death, perhaps owing to the potential for virus-induced liver inflamma- tion.14,33,37 Other prognostic decision rules have used similar analytic approaches27,28,33 but had lower predictive perfor- mance, with C-statistics ranging from 0.80 to 0.82, and were based on patients from early in the pandemic.

In our data set, this was most closely reflected by arrival from long-term care, which indicated patients with lower performance status. Limitations Canada is a culturally diverse country that offers its citizens publicly funded health coverage for necessary physician and hospital care. The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score needs to be validated externally in other health care systems. Our model could be validated externally for use in remote areas without access to laboratory testing or imaging, and in low-income countries. It predicts in-hospital mortality and may have missed deaths that occurred at home or deaths among discharged patients who returned to non-CCEDRRN hospitals. We captured readmissions to CCEDRRN sites, although it is unlikely that they had an influence on our model given their small numbers.20Our model was based on patients with confirmed COVID- 19. Although many presented to the emergency department with NAAT-confirmed COVID-19, validation in a cohort of patients with suspected COVID-19 is needed. We excluded patients if they were transferred to a non-CCEDRRN institu- tion, as we would have been unable to ascertain their out- comes. However, the numbers of such patients were small, and their exclusion likely did not have a significant effect on the model. Our results apply to unvaccinated patients. The per- formance of risk tools also needs to be evaluated in patients who are fully or partially vaccinated and may have a different risk of dying from COVID-19 than unvaccinated patients. We were unable to link our data set with vaccine registry data. However, by Jan. 31, 2021, only 0.3% of Canadians, most of whom were health care workers or residents of long- term care, had been fully vaccinated.38 Most residents of long- term care were excluded from our study owing to palliative code status. Thus, our results are applicable to unvaccinated patients.

The score also needs to be validated in cohorts infected with variants of concern and in a more recent data set, given newer treatment regimens that may affect mortality risk. Conclusion The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score is a simple clinical risk score that can be applied at the bedside in the emergency department to predict unvaccinated patients' mor- tality risk. There have been changes in treatment and emer- gence of new variants that may limit its utility. This tool can be used to inform goals-of-care decisions. References 1. Tan E, Song J, Deane AM, et al.

The authors thank all of their patient part- ners who shared their lived experiences and perspectives to ensure that the knowledge cocreated addresses the concerns of patients and the pub- lic. Creating the largest network of collaboration across Canadian emer- gency departments would not have been feasible without the tireless efforts of emergency department chiefs and research coordinators and research assistants at participating sites. Finally, the authors extend their most humble and sincere gratitude to all of their colleagues in medicine, nursing and the allied health care professions who have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic from day one, staffing ambulances, emergency departments, intensive care units and hospitals, and bravely facing the risks of COVID-19 to look after their fellow citizens and one another. The authors dedicate this network to them.
