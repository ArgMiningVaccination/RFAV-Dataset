According to [3] out of the about 250,000- 500,000 plant species estimated by the [4], only a small percentage has been investigated phytochemically and even a smaller percentage has been properly studied in terms of their pharmacological proper - ties. Among the underexplored leguminous plant is Piliostigma thon- ningii which is found to be loaded in several secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, phenol, tannins and alkaloids [5,6], minerals and vitamins [7]. The plant belongs to the family Caesalpi niacea and found in abundant in most part of the world including Africa and Asia. The plant leaves have been reported to contain 10.09 % protein, 2.81 % fat, 6.10 % ash, 5.23 % crude fibre, 72.17 % carbohydrates and also have properties [12]. Several studies have been carried out on different plant extracts on animal's performance. According to clove extract at 400 ppm caused a significant (P<0.05) increase in final weight of broilers. Piliostigma thonningii leaf extract at 0.4g/kg of body weight has also been re- ported to reduce blood cholesterol level in Wistar rats. According to [13], Parkia biglobosa, Delonix regia leaf extract and garlic/ lemon grass extract have helped to improve weight gain, feed conversion ratio, blood profile and reduce mortality in birds. However, limited information is available on the effect of PTE on the blood profile of broilers. A timely evaluation of PTE will give a clue on the immune system of the animal and provides its safe recommended level in broiler chicks. Materials and Methods Site of the experiment The experiment was carried out at Division of Animal Nutrition, Sumitra Research Farm, Gujarat, India during the month of August to October, 2019. Collection and processing of test material Fresh and mature leaves (Piliostigma thonningii ) were obtained from the premises of Sumitra research farm in India and was authen - ticated by a taxonomist and assigned a voucher number (FS-09-345), air dried and later grinded into fine particles using a laboratory blend- er. The extract (PTE) was prepared by putting 150 grams of the pow-dered sample in 1000 ml of distilled water for 2 days after which John A, et al., J Protein Res Bioinform 2020, 2: 006 DOI: 10.24966/PRB-1545/100006 HSOA Journal of Protein and Bioinformatics John1, *, Sharma DO1 and Xing Liu2 1Department of Animal Production, Sumitra Research Farm, Gujarat, India 2Norton Quality Control Laboratory, NorwayEffect of Aqueous Piliostigma Thonningii Leaf Extracts on the Heamatological and Serum Biochemical Indices of Broiler Starter Chicks Abstract Three hundred one-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were used to evaluate the effect of aqueous Piliostigma thonningii Leaf Extracts (PTE) serum biochemical parame - ters of broiler chicks. The birds were randomly assigned to five treat- ments of four replicates consisting of 15 birds each in a completely randomized design. Birds in Treatment 1 (T1) were given PTE at 0 % while T2, 60ml and 80ml per liter of water. Feed and water were offered ad libitum through - out the experiment which lasted for 4 weeks. The hematological pa-rameters examined are: Pack Cell Volume (PCV), Hemoglobin (Hb), Red Blood Cells (RBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), White blood cells (WBC) and its differentials while those of serum biochemical parameters are: Albumin, showed that all the hematological parameters were analyzed were higher in bird in T5 compared with control group (P<0.05). Albumin, globulin, total protein, cholesterol, urea, SGPT and SGOT values were significantly reduced as the level of PTE increases across the treatments (P<0.05). Creatinine level were not significantly (p>0.05) different among the treatments as an indication that the integrity of the kidney was not compromised. It could be concluded that PTE at levels up to 80 ml have no deleterious effect on the blood profile of birds.Keywords: Broiler chicks; Hematology; Piliostigma thonningii leaf extractCitation: John A, S, Liu X (2020) Effect of Aqueous Piliostigma Thonningii Leaf Extracts on the Heamatological and Serum Biochemical Indices of Broiler Starter Chicks.

The powdered sample was also subjected to proximate analysis. Experimental animals and management Three hundred one-day old Ross 308 broiler chicks were used for the experiment. Prior to the commencement of the study, the pens were properly disinfected with Morigad at 10 ml to 50 liters of water, feeders and drinkers were thoroughly washed and all other electrical fittings were fixed. The birds were weighed on arrival to the farm and thereafter weekly and distributed randomly into five (5) treatments of 300 chicks of four replicates each consisting of 15 birds and electric brooders were used as source of heat. All other management practices were strictly observed and a vaccination program was designed, vac-cines were administered according to the prevailing disease condition in the environment. Water soluble multi-vitamins (Biovite super\u00ae at 1ml to 5 litres of water) was given to the chicks before 3 days of vac- cination and 3 days after vaccinations in order to guard stress. Fresh, clean and cool drinking water was provided to the experimental bird's ad-libitum . Feed formulation and experimental design Birds were fed basal diet formulated according to NRC. Starter diet was given between (0-4 weeks) containing a crude protein of 23.40 % and metabolizable energy of 2950.6 kcal/ kg. Treatment 1 (Control) was given 0 % PTE, treatment 2, 3, 4 and 5 were given PTE at levels 20 ml, 40ml, 60ml and 80 ml/ liter respectively. The experimental design that was used is a Completely randomized design (CRD). Blood analysis At 4th week, twelve birds were randomly from each treatment for haematological and serum biochemical analysis. Selected animals were kept in a stress-free environment to prevent oxygenated blood becoming deoxygenated during blood collection. The sampled birds were bled from punctured wing vein to aspire 5mls of blood from each bird out of which 2mls was collected into bijou bottle treated with Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate (EDTA) for haematological as-say. Complete blood analysis was performed within three (3) hours of collection using a commercial diagnostic kit (Nosrac diagnostic ana-lyzer, China). Pack cell volume was estimated by micro haematocrit method [14]. Red blood cell, haemoglobin, haemoglobin, white blood cell and its absolute counts were determined by using Neubauer's chamber. Values of MCV , MCH and MCHC using: blood)/PCV \u00d7 100 Blood for serum analysis was collected into bottles free from anticoagulant and taken to the laboratory for further analysis. Com- mercial diagnostic kits were used for determination of total protein, calcium, sodium, bicarbonate, phosphorus, total cholesterol, low den-sity lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, glucose, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, along with the the method outlined by [15].Laboratory analysis Proximate analysis of feed (crude protein, crude fiber, ether ex- tracts and ash) were determined in accordance with the Official Methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [16]. Phytochemical analysis of saponins, flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, [17,18]. Tannins [19] and flavonoids [20] contents were also determined in the extracts. Statistical analysis All data collected were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) using SPSS (25.0) and significant means was separated using [21] multiple range tests significant will be declared if P 0.05. * Premix supplied per kg diet: - Vit A, 13,000 I.U; Vit E, 5mg; Vit 3000I.U, same are significantly different (P<0.05) RBC: Red blood cell, WBC: white blood cell, MCV: corpus- cular volume, corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, MCH: Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, SEM: Standard error of mean Results The ingredients composition of experimental diet is presented in (Table 1).

The extract revealed the presence of bioactive chemicals like alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins steroids respectively . Hematological parameters of broiler chicks give different levels of PTE is presented in (Table 4). The parameters determined were Pck cell volume (PCV), Hemoglobin (Hb), Erythrocyte sedimenta - (ESR), corpuscular hemoglo - bin (MCH), Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), Mean corpuscu-lar hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and White blood cell (WBC) with its differentials. PCV values obtained are 27.10 %, 28.57 %, 32.04 and WBC values were significantly (p<0.05) different among the treatments. Values for MCH are significantly (p>0.05) influenced by the oral inclusion of PTE. Table 5 shows the serum biochemical indices of broiler chicks giv- en different levels of PTE. Albumin values obtained are 1.55, 1.71, 1.82, 1.76 and 1.83 for T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 and SGOT values were sig- nificantly (p<0.05) different among the treatments. Urea values ob- tained are 1.88, 1.71, 1.45, 1.20 and 1.10 (mg/dl) for T1, T2, T3, T4 significant difference (p>0.05) was observed in the creatinine values among the treatments. Means with same superscript Discussion The crude protein (11.21 %), crude fibre (14.22 %), ash (7.22 %) obtained for Piliostigma thonningi leaves in this experiment were higher than those reported by [22]. This differences in the proximate components could be attributed to differences in soil type, age, spe-cies, season and location [23]. Phytochemical constituents of Pili - ostigma thonningi leaf extract also reveals that tannin has the highest concentration, followed by saponin, flavonoids, alkaloids and steroids respectively. This composition agrees with the findings of [24] but contrary with reports of who reported a concentration of saponin is highest in ethanolic extraction of Piliostigma thonningi leaves. Ac- cording to [25], extraction method and age of plants are some car - dinals that could influence the phytochemical composition of plants. However, all the values reported in this experiment are below the lethal dose reported by [26,27]. According to [28] each medicinal plant species has its own nutrient composition besides having phar - macologically important phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are also bioactive chemicals or secondary metabolites which performs mul-tiple biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-microbial effect, modulation of detoxification enzymes, stimulation of the immune system [29]. Tannins have been reported to perform antibacterial and antiviral activities [30].Parameters % Composition Moisture 8.79 Crude protein 11.21 Crude fibre 14.22 Ether extract 0.31 Ash 7.22 leavess.

Hemato-biochemical analysis has been found useful for disease prognosis and feed stress monitoring [32] and their variations in animals have been attributed to age and sex [33], breed [34], feed replacement [35] WBC and MCHC values significantly (P<0.05) increased from treatment 1 to 5. Though the hemoglobin range (9.12 - 13.60 g/dl) reported in this experiment which is slightly higher than 8.00 - 9.60 g/dl recorded by [36], however, all values were within the reference range for broilers [37,38]. According to hematological values cannot be absolutely constant due to variations in age, breed, strain and sampling techniques. An increase in the RBC level is an in- dication of increased oxygen in the animal tissue [39,40] also opined that a significant increase in PCV reveals a better transport of oxygen and absorbed nutrients, thus result in an increased primary and sec-ondary polycythemia. PCV and MCH are also significant indices in the diagnosis of anemia and also serve as useful parameters of the bone marrow capacity to produce red blood cells in animals [41]. White blood cells play a vital role in the prevention of disease or infection, thus animals with low WBC level stand a risk of disease infections. Animals in T 4 and T5 with high WBC are capable of gen- erating antibodies and have a high degree of resistance to diseases [42]. Leucocyte count and its differentials have also been reported to increase during stress and unfavorable conditions [43,44]. Described basophils and eosinophils as important effector cells in allergy and host defense responses particularly against parasitic infections. Total protein, cholesterol, urea, SGPT and SGOT were signifi- cantly (p<0.05) different among the treatment, the total protein level increased significantly from treatment 1 to 5. This is a clear indication that the protein reserve in the diet is enough to maintain and support the growth of the animal. According to [45] fluctuation in serum albu-min could be attributed to the quality of diet as well as the presence of diseases. Similarly, globulins play a significant role in fighting in-fections, hormone carrier as well as blood clotting process because of the presence of antibodies and enzymes in them. Cholesterol and urea level decreased as the level of PTE increased. The trend in the cholesterol level is a sign that the meat is safe for consumption and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, it also shows that PTE con-tains hypolipidemic substances. This result agrees with the findings of [46,47] when banana leaf was used as a phytoadditive in the diets of broiler chicks. Urea is a useful indicator of kidney failure in birds, creatinine lev- el was not significantly (p>0.05) influenced by PTE, this shows that the integrity of the animal's kidney is maintained. According to [48], creatinine builds up in the blood can occur once the kidney is not filtering the blood effectively. However, all the values of the serum biochemical constituents studied fall within the ranges for broilers re-ported by [49] on the serum biochemical values chick-ens in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. SGPT and SGOT level decrease as the level of PTE increases in the treatment. According to [50], SGPT and SGOT respond the pres- ence of toxic substance in the blood. PTE has revealed to be non-toxic to the animal, similar observation was made by when Parkia biglobo- sa leaf extract was feed to broiler chickens at different levels.Conclusion Secondary plant metabolites or bioactive chemicals gives plants the strength to perform multiple biological activities such as antimi - crobial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, phytogenic feed additive because of their abundant phytochemicals and was found to be loaded with several minerals with allows birds to attain optimal performance. It can be included in the diet of broiler chicks up to 80 ml per litre with no detrimental effect on the performance and health status of birds. References 1.
