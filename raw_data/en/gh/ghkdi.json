The Guardian reports: In the report, the scientists describe how synthetic biology, which gives researchers precision tools to manipulate living organisms, \"enhances and expands\" opportunities to create bioweapons. \"As the power of the technology increases, that brings a general need to scrutinize where harms could come from,\" said Peter Carr, a senior scientist at MIT's Synthetic Biology Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The report calls on the U.S. government to rethink how it conducts disease surveillance, so it can better detect novel bioweapons, and to look at ways to bolster defenses, for example by finding ways to make and deploy vaccines far more rapidly.
