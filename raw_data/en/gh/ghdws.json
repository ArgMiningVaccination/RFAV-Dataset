J Gervase Vernon Introduction MASS immunisation for protection from infectious dis- ease is generally acknowledged to be one of the most outstanding achievements of modern medicine,1and its benefits have been eloquently set out. 2However, it has recently come under public suspicion, with large sections ofthe population turning away from pertussis vaccination inthe 1980s, 3and, more recently, from the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.4-6 The significant fall in coverage that led to a pertussis epidemic in the 1980s hasnot been repeated on the same scale for the MMR vaccine. 7 Similarly, there has been resistance against hepatitis B vac-cination in France, based on the belief that it causes multi-ple sclerosis. 8One campaign against it was so successful that routine immunisation of adolescents in France was sus-pended in 1997. 9While an older generation can remember the infectious diseases for which we now have vaccinations,there is a generation that has never seen measles, let alonepolio or smallpox. There is a much greater public distrust ofmedications in general, and vaccines in particular, togetherwith an increased awareness of side effects. In such a cli-mate, it is proving difficult to maintain the high coverageneeded for herd immunity. In the BJGP , Jewell suggests that it is time for a new approach to the public, to listen to the layvoice without an excessive dependence on experts. 10 Shortly after this article was published, perhaps throughcoincidence, the Joint Committee on Vaccination andImmunisation of the Department of Health in Englandagreed to appoint a lay member. This appointment has,however, so far been delayed. 11Can we, then, engage the public in decisions about vaccination, paralleling the advo-cated move from compliance to concordance with regard tomedication? 12,13Are the taking of medicine and the accep- tance of immunisation sufficiently similar for this to be a use-ful analogy (Table 1)? Can research tell us anything abouthow those who refuse immunisations think, and thereforehow we might talk to them? The developing world First through the Expanded Programme on Immunisation(EPI), and more recently through the Global Alliance forVaccines and Immunisations (GAVI), 16vaccination has proved to be dramatically effective in developing countries.Immunisation has lowered rates of childhood mortality there,especially against measles. This effect has been seen evenwhere living standards are falling. This is in contrast to thedeveloped world, in which McKeown 17demonstrated long ago (although some would qualify this),18that declining mor- tality preceded immunisations and was owing to other fac-tors, such as public health improvements and rising livingstandards. However, even in developing countries there hasJ G Vernon, MA, MSc, DCH, MRCP (Paeds), FRCGP, general practitioner and general practice trainer, Dunmow, Essex.

This discussion paper explores the concepts of herd immunity, altruism, and informed consent. Historical, quantitative, andqualitative research on the sociology of immunisation isreviewed. Recent research has shown that the concerns of par-ents include a loss of trust in health professionals and increasingworries about side effects. The sociologist Streefland is the leader of the World Health Organisation Sociology and Immunisation Project. His concept ofthe five perspectives on immunisation is explained. Concordanceis then described as a dialogue based on mutual respect betweendifferent perspectives. Finally, some suggestions are made forimmunisation policy in the UK. Immunisation policy should move from the current situation, which largely assumes the passive compliance of the population,to a policy where people are actively involved and their viewsrespected.Keywords: immunisation; policy; sociology; compliance; concor- dance.been resistance against vaccination. For example, in the Philippines a rumour arose that tetanus toxoid vaccinationwas being used for family planning purposes. For this rea-son, it was strongly opposed by the pro-life Roman CatholicChurch. The Church was able to obtain a court order forbid-ding the Department of Health to continue giving the vacci-nation. 19,20 Herd immunity, altruism and consent The effectiveness of immunisation depends on two factors:personal immunity leading to some protection against infec-tion, and herd immunity, which prevents the infectious agentfrom circulating in the community and which protects boththe immunised and those who are not immunised. The deci-sion to immunise a child may therefore have an altruisticelement; that is to say, there is an intention to benefit notonly the child, but also the whole community. 21This altruis- tic element will be particularly marked for some vaccinesand absent for some, such as the tetanus vaccine. Forexample, in the early days of pertussis vaccination in theUnited Kingdom (UK), children who were older than sixmonths were vaccinated, yet the principal beneficiaries ofherd immunity were children from birth to six months of age.These young babies were the ones who were most at riskfrom pertussis. In another striking example in Japan, vacci-nating schoolchildren against influenza was obligatory from1977 to 1987. This was principally to provide indirect pro-tection against influenza to elderly adults. 22This altruistic element is of direct relevance to informed consent because,unless the parents are aware of it, their consent is notinformed. Valid consent requires a sound mind, sufficientunderstanding, and a free agreement. 23There has been par- ticular emphasis on consent in the United States, and morerecently in the UK. 24The importance of this altruistic element is clear, because the damage to the community is rapid andobvious if immunisation rates fall. In the UK in 1974, forexample, a report on the adverse effects of pertussis vaccinewas taken up by the media. 25This led to a fall in vaccine uptake to 30%, and then an epidemic of pertussis. It tooka decade for immunisation uptake to return to previouslevels. 3 The scope of research to date In summarising research to date, it is important to be awareof both the variety of research methods used and the verydifferent groups of people who do not accept immunisationamong whom this research has been carried out. A non-systematic search reveals data in many places, mainlysocial science databases, with only a minority indexed inMEDLINE. Techniques range from narrative-based methods(including historical research), 26-32to qualitative33-38and quantitative methods,39-42and, lastly, epidemiology.3,9 The subjects in the groups interviewed range from those who refuse all immunisations43to those who accept only some,3,9,19,20,33-35and, lastly, to those who accept the full immunisation programme.38There is a particular shortage of qualitative research into the last group, therefore there isscope for research on why parents who have their childrenfully immunised choose to do so. Finally, the researchers setout to find very diverse reasons for refusal to immunise.Some researchers were looking for group reasons forrefusal, 9,19,20,43,46 others for individual reasons,33-37,43and oth- ers were looking for difficulties of access owing to geo-graphical factors, transport, or staff rudeness. 44 Research in the UK Early research into vaccine coverage emphasised socialand cultural factors, such as class and employment. 39,40,45 Qualitative research in the UK into what people think aboutimmunisation is sparse. An early qualitative paper showedthat those people who did not immunise did not differ asmuch from those who did so in relation to access to immu-nisation as in their beliefs about immunisation. 33In the 1980s, Rogers and Pilgrim34,46conducted a number of inter- views with parents and professional groups. They empha-sised that those who were against immunisation had a ratio-nal position, albeit that it was different from the official one.They noted that: 'this group of mothers tended to beparagons of virtue, if not zealots, about reducing potentialrisks to their children's health in every respect except immu-nisation'. They also felt that the official view minimised orglossed over the possible side effects of vaccines. Theseconclusions were criticised in other papers in the same sym-posium as Rogers and Pilgrim. These papers emphasisedthe safety of vaccines, the severity of some infectious dis-eases, and the lack of evidence of long-term harm from vac-cines. 47 Two UK papers have looked at this area recently. The first was a focus group study with groups of both immunisersand non-immunisers. 38This study, which was among the first to concentrate on immunisers, showed that they sharedthe concerns of non-immunisers. Non-immunisers weremore likely to be concerned about unknown long-term sideeffects of vaccines and to consider that vaccines placedstress on the immune system, rather than strengthening it. 36 The other UK study was of non-immunising parents.35In both studies the risk of side effects was found to be animportant issue for the parents. They discussed immunisa-tion from a risk perspective, and had lost trust in health pro-fessionals. For these parents the decision about immu- 400 British Journal of General Practice, May 2003J G Vernon Table 1. Differences between immunisation and the taking of medicine.

They would have felt guilty if their child had sideeffects, but if their child fell ill, this was seen as natural andnot their responsibility. 34,38,48 Research worldwide There has been an organised effort by the WHO, throughtheir social science and immunisation project, to obtain datafrom developed and developing countries. 49,50The results have been summarised by Streefland.8,44The causes of fail- ure to immunise have been found to differ in developed anddeveloping countries. 8In developing countries non- immunisers may find access difficult, they may have hadexperience of rudeness from people working in immunisa-tion services, or they may belong to a social group whoseideology clashes with that of the government promoting theimmunisation programme. 51In developed countries resis- tance may be owing to an organised belief system, such ashomeopathy, 52 Christian Science,43or anthroposophy,53but more typically it is on an individual basis, as a personalchoice. Where there is individual choice, however, it may beinformed by various sources. As well as the popular pressand books, there is a plethora of websites that are violentlyagainst immunisation. 54-57 In an excellent paper, which sum- marises work to date on the sociology of immunisation,Streefland describes five explanatory perspectives on immu-nisation 44(Box 1). Each perspective could be seen as a sep- arate discourse; that is, a scheme of mutually cohesive andrelated ideas. Any individual is likely to view the situationfrom more than one perspective or participate in more thanone discourse. One perspective is that of normality. For example, there is the case of the mother who has her child immunisedbecause it is the 'normal' thing to do, and it is what herfriends do. Identity is defined by the choices we make, asdescribed by Anthony Giddens. 60This perspective is that of the well-educated non-immunisers interviewed by Rogersand Pilgrim. 46It contrasts with pre-modern societies, where the group to which one belongs more closely defines thechoices that are made. However, social factors still havestrong effects in modern societies, 61and indeed they have recently been shown to influence MMR coverage.62 For the mother using the 'rational choice' perspective, the question of trust becomes important. Which source of infor-mation should she trust? Falling trust in experts is a recur-ring theme in modern society. 63In the case of immunisation there is the particular problem that general practitioners(GPs) no longer give unbiased advice. Since the 1990Contract, they are paid by the National Health Service togive the advice reckoned to be of greatest good to the com-munity. Initially, paying GPs to reach certain targets byimproving their organisation and the advice they gave haddramatic results in improving immunisation coverage in theUK, although a Cochrane review of target payments world-wide shows only a small effect. 64Some research suggests that non-immunising mothers are now discounting theirGPs' advice because they believe it is biased by their finan-cial stake in the process. 35,38If this is the case, then we should reconsider this method of payment. How to improve coverage Are there any other ways to improve coverage? Recent pub-lications include an editorial in the BJGP , 65a Cochrane review showing the effectiveness of patient reminders,66and a meta-analysis of interventions to improve immunisation.67 These have shown that, after health service factors, financialincentives and reminders to mothers are the most effectiveinterventions. Incentives to the mother have not been tried inthe UK, but have been tried elsewhere. Proof of immunisa-tion has been required for school entry in the United States(US), some parts of Germany, and some states in Australia.In France, proof of immunisation has been a prerequisite forreceiving certain benefits. 46 What might we mean by concordance? Concordance in immunisation policy must mean a processthat occurs not only at the individual level, but also at a soci-etal level. Concordance needs to be more than just a trans-fer of information about consumers' wishes to the state; itmust involve a transfer of power to some degree. Simplyimproving presentation by means of techniques such asfocus groups to elicit opinion may improve coverage in theshort term, but could be seen in the longer term as coercingthe public and could further alienate them. This potentialdanger of the abuse of qualitative methods has recentlybeen pointed out. 68Concordance in immunisation policy is a specific example of the question of involving the public inhealthcare decisions. According to Holm, we can only hopeto make this process transparent, accountable, and fair. 69 We cannot hope to make it fully rational because the goalsof a healthcare system are multiple and indistinct. The prob-lem with immunisation is how to capture the multipleexplanatory discourses used by the parties involved, espe-cially the mothers, and make them mutually comprehensi-ble. 70,71This does not necessarily mean something 'warm and cosy'. For example, if the day came when most mothersthought of immunisation in terms of risk analysis, then thecurrent successful policy of immunising baby boys againstrubella would become untenable because there is little ben-efit to the individual boy. Concordance must mean more than evidence-based health care 72simplistically interpreted. Those who pio- neered evidence-based medicine emphasised from thebeginning that the evidence should be applied to the indi-vidual. 73However, some of those who followed their lead have not taken into account the fact that many people lookat life quite happily from a number of different perspectives.For example, they may have both a scientific view of theworld and other quite incompatible world views.Concordance, then, should mean not only applying the evi-dence to the individual, but also dialogue between perspec-tives based on different views of the world. It means anexchange of views and mutual respect between these verydifferent views. Certainly, this can be difficult. For example,the recent report of the Chief Medical Officer's working partyon chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic British Journal of General Practice, May 2003 401Discussion papersencephalomyelitis74 demonstrated an attempt to synthesise disparate voices, but failed to keep the original broad-basedmembership together. That it may be possible is, however, at least suggested by an interesting new approach pioneered by Professor JakeChapman, working with large organisations. 75 He maintains that large organisations \u2014 and the immunisation systemcould be viewed as one of these \u2014 are not simple linear sys-tems that can be managed by a command and control styleof management. Each of these is a complex adaptive sys-tem whose whole is, in some sense, greater than the sum ofits parts. His approach, which has been successful withlarge government information technology projects, 76 involves finding solutions to which all participants subscribe,showing sensitivity to different perspectives, and avoidingmultiple pre-set targets that can have perverse effects. Conclusion There have been protests against immunisation from theearliest days of smallpox vaccinations. 26-29,31In a free society it has proved necessary to allow for conscientious objectionand to accept less than 100% coverage. However, in thiscurrent post-modern society, the 'top-down' policy currentlypursued by the Department of Health is, in the opinion ofmany, likely to work less and less well. We will need toengage with the public concerning the need for immunisa-tion, perhaps by means of focus groups to elicit public opin-ion and go beyond the public surveys currently carried out. 77 We will need better public information campaigns. Somevideos already exist, and these could be more widely dis-seminated. 78-80Perhaps the government's new health pro- motion agency will be the right agency to organise this.81 There needs to be a shift in immunisation practice, parallelto that regarding the taking of medicines, from complianceto concordance. Such a change requires ongoing qualitativeresearch into how both immunisers and non-immunisersthink. It will require much greater funds for public informa-tion campaigns when new immunisations are decided upon.However, such changes are needed if the benefits of this oldand established public health practice are to be maintainedin the new millennium. It could be said that public policy about immunisation illustrates and reflects a current tensionin wider health policy between an increased reliance on sci-entific evidence and a wish to have a patient-centredapproach, and between the needs as defined by the expertsand the wants expressed by the public. The latest change in the UK immunisation policy against diphtheria is a good example of the current approach.Recently there have been epidemics of diphtheria in thecountries of the old Soviet Union. Surveys have shown thatthe adult population of the UK have little protection againstdiphtheria. 82The response of the Department of Health has been to write to vaccine manufacturers in the UK discourag-ing them from producing single antigen tetanus vaccine.Soon, only double antigen tetanus and diphtheria vaccineswill be available. A circular has been sent to GPs and acci-dent and emergency departments informing them of thischange. 82There has been no consultation or attempt to inform the public, and it will be left to GPs and others toinform patients of the need for vaccination when they attendwith minor injuries. This approach is open to the risk thatanother anti-vaccine movement will arise, demanding singletetanus vaccine. A new approach that elicited public opin-ion, allowed for conscientious objection, involved the targetgroups in decision making, and included a public informa-tion campaign that created a social demand for immunisa-tion, 44,51,83would reduce these risks.
