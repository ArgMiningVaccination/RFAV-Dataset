The U.S. Supreme Court decision, Olmstead v. L.C (1999) declared that unnecessary segregation of individuals in institutions mi ght constitute discrimination based on disability and be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The decision affects q ualified individuals with a physical, mental, or age-related disability who are receiving state-supported long-term care in a state hosp ital or nursing home that could also benefit from community placement and are not opposed to the move. It also affects people with disa bil- ities who need state-supported community-based services to avoid going to state hospitals or nursing homes. Since the Olmsteaddecision, Georgia has taken steps to comply with the ruling by making more community services available and accessible to Geor-gians with disabilities.Use of Olmstead State Georgia's In Brief Amended FY 2012 and FY 2013 33Georgia Senate Georgia SenateAmended FY 2012 Budget Highlights Program Budget Changes: FY 2013 Budget Highlights Program Budget Changes:Lieutenant Governor's Office 1.
