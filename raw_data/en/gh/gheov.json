SUPPLEMENT II Child Care Programs 158 Effective 6-1-2022 WHAT IS CHILD ABUSE? What is the Law? Oklahoma statutes define child abuse as harm or threatened harm to a child's health or welfare by a person responsible for the child. This includes non - accidental physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or neglect (10A O.S. \u00a7 1-2-101). Physi cal abuse is non -accidental physical injury to a child. Mental injury is an injury to a child's psychological growth and development. It is caused by a chronic pattern of behaviors, such as belittling, humiliating and ridiculing a child. Sexual abuse, in general terms, includes any sexual activity between an adult and a child for the purpose of sexually stimulating the adult, the child or others. Sexual abuse may also be committed by a person under the age of 18 when that person is either significantly ol der than the victim or is in a position of power or control over the child. Neglect is the failure of the parent or caretaker to provide a child with basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, medical care, protection and supervision. Threatened harm mea ns a substantial risk of harm to the child. It may include acts or expressions of intent to inflict actual harm presently or in the future. Who must report? Every person, private citizen or professional, who has reason to believe that a child has been ab used, is mandated by law to promptly report suspected abuse. Failure to do so is a misdemeanor. A person making a report in good faith is immune from civil or criminal liability. The name of the reporter is kept confidential. When to report? A report sh ould be made when there is reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused. A report of suspected abuse is a request for an investigation. Investigation of child abuse reports is the responsibility of Child Welfare workers and, when a crime may have been committed, law enforcement officials. If other incidents of abuse occur after the initial report has been made, another report should be made. How is abuse reported? A report may be made to the 24 -hour statewide Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, 1 -800-522-3511.

SUPPLEMENT IV Child Care Programs 161 Effective 6-1-2022 CHILD PASSENGER RESTRAINT SYSTEM Oklahoma Statute 47 O.S. Section 11 -1112 (Amended 06-06-17) A. Every driver, when transporting a child u nder eight (8) years of age in a motor vehicle operated on the roadways, streets, or highways of this state, shall provide for the protection of said child by properly using a child passenger restraint system as follows: 1. A child under four (4) years of age shall be properly secured in a child passenger restraint system. Except as provided in subsection G of this section, the child passenger restraint system shall be rear -facing until the child reaches two (2) years of age or until the child reaches the w eight or height limit of the rear -facing child passenger restraint system as allowed by the manufacturer of the child passenger restraint system, whichever occurs first; and 2. A child at least four (4) years of age but younger than eight (8) years of age, if not taller than 4 feet 9 inches in height, shall be properly secured in either a child passenger restraint system or child booster seat. For purposes of this section and Section 11 -1113 of this title, \"child passenger restraint system\" means an infant or child passenger restraint system which meets the federal standards as set by 49 C.F.R., Section 571.213. B. If a child is eight (8) years of age or is taller than 4 feet 9 inches in height, a seat belt properly secured to the vehicle shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of this section. C. The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 1. The driver of a school bus, taxicab, moped, motorcycle, or other mot or vehicle not required to be equipped with safety belts pursuant to state or federal laws; 2. The driver of an ambulance or emergency vehicle; 3. The driver of a vehicle in which all of the seat belts are in use; 4. The transportation of children who for medical reasons are unable to be placed in such devices, provided there is written documentation from a physician of such medical reason; or 5. The transportation of a child who weighs more than forty (40) pounds and who is being transported in the back se at of a vehicle while wearing only a lap safety belt when the back seat of the vehicle is not equipped with combination lap and shoulder safety belts, or when the combination lap and shoulder safety belts in the back seat are being used by other children w ho weigh more than forty (40) pounds. Provided, however, for purposes of this paragraph, back seat shall include all seats located behind the front seat of a vehicle operated by a licensed child care facility or church. Provided further, there shall be a r ebuttable presumption that a child has met the weight requirements of this SUPPLEMENT IV Child Care Programs 162 Effective 6-1-2022 paragraph if at the request of any law enforcement officer, the licensed child care facility or church provides the officer with a written statement verified by the parent or legal guardian that the child weighs more than forty (40) pounds. D. A violation of the provisions of this section shall be admissible as evidence in any civil action or proceeding for damages unless the plaintiff in such action or proceeding is a child under si xteen (16) years of age. In any action brought by or on behalf of an infant for personal injuries or wrongful death sustained in a motor vehicle collision, the failure of any person to have the infant properly restrained in accordance with the provisions o f this section shall not be used in aggravation or mitigation of damages. E. A person who is certified as a Child Passenger Safety Technician and who in good faith provides inspection, adjustment, or educational services regarding child passenger restraint systems shall not be liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in providing such services, other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. F. Any person convicted of violating subsection A of t his section shall be punished by a fine of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) and shall pay all court costs thereof. Revenue from such fine shall be apportioned to the Department of Public Safety Restricted Revolving Fund and used by the Oklahoma Highway Safety Office to promote the use of child passenger restraint systems as provided in Section 11 -1113 of this title. This fine shall be suspended and the court costs limited to a max imum of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) in the case of the first offense upon proof of purchase or acquisition by loan of a child passenger restraint system. Provided, the Department of Public Safety shall not assess points to the driving record of any person con victed of a violation of this section. G. A driver of a vehicle who has been rightfully issued a detachable placard indicating physical disability under the provisions of Section 15 -112 of this title or a physically disabled license plate under the provisions of Section 1135.1 or 1135.2 of this title and valid letter of forward -facing exemption issued from the Department of Public Safety shall be permitted to transport a child passenger under four (4) years of age in a forward -facing child passen ger restraint system. The placard and forward -facing exemption letter must be present in the vehicle to be in compliance. SUPPLEMENT IV Child Care Programs 163 Effective 6-1-2022 CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY IN OKLAHOMA Most Frequently Asked Questions What is the purpose and intent of the child passenger r estraint law? Car crashes are the number one cause of injury and death to children in Oklahoma. A 45 -lb. child in a 30 -mph crash will be thrown with a force of 1,350 lbs. Fortunately, child safety seats provide a 45 -70 percent reduction in significant injuries, depending on the type of seat that is used (booster seat, convertible seat, infant seat, etc.). What are the statistics on death or serious injuries in Oklahoma? More than 20 children under 6 years of age die each year in motor vehicle crash es, and more than 1,100 children are injured, many permanently. More than 70 percent of children who die are not in a child safety seat. What does the law require? Children under the age of 8 must be transported using a car seat or booster seat. All children under age 4 must be properly secured in a car seat with an internal harness. A 5-point harness is the safest restraint system and should be used as long as possible (until the child exceeds the harness' weight limit). Children under age 2 must be properly secured in a rear -facing car seat. Rear -facing is the safest way for small children to travel, and they should remain rear -facing until they reach 2 years of age or until they exceed the height or weight limit of the car seat. Riding rear -facing with legs bent or against the back of the seat is a safe and comfortable position for children. This position best protects their head, neck and spinal cord in the event of a crash. Children ages 4 -7 must ride in a child passenger restraint system or booster seat unless they are taller than 4'9\". SUPPLEMENT IV Child Care Programs 164 Effective 6-1-2022 Are there exemptions to the law that affect child care facilities? Exemptions include: school buses, over 10,000 lbs., or any vehicle not required by law to be equipped with seat belts; and medical issues prohibiting use of belt or restraint system. What about older vehicles that do not have shoulder belts in the back seat? What about the center back seat position, which usually does not include a shoulder belt? Belt positioning booster seats r equire the use of a lap/shoulder belt. There are only a few seats that do not. For this reason, an exemption was included in the law. The law \"shall not apply to . . . the transportation of a child who weighs more than 40 lbs. and who is being transport ed in the back seat of a vehicle while wearing only a lap safety belt when the back seat of the vehicle is not equipped with combination lap and shoulder safety belts, or when the combination lap and shoulder safety belts in the back seat are being used by other children who weigh more than 40 lbs.\" While lengthy, the exemption was worded this way in part to prevent a motorist from placing a 4 - or 5-year-old child in the center lap belt with no booster seat, with empty lap/shoulder belts on either side. T his wording closes that loophole for motorists who would deliberately attempt to skirt the law. Are there different types of booster seats? Booster seats for children over 40 lbs. (about 4 years old) generally fall into two categories: backless booste rs and high -back boosters. Both are considered \"belt - positioning\" boosters, because they help to properly position the lap belt on the child's lap and hip bones, rather than the abdomen. High-back boosters are recommended for positions in vehicles that do not have head rests (usually older vans and pickup trucks). Both seats achieve the same thing: they boost the child high enough so that the seat belt fits properly. Both require the use of a lap/shoulder belt. SUPPLEMENT IV Child Care Programs 165 Effective 6-1-2022 What are some important facts to rem ember considering the transportation of children? Be sure that any booster seat, car seat or infant seat is used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure that the type of passenger restraint system is used properly with the type of seat belt system that is installed in your vehicle. Remember to verify the particular car seat is appropriate for the specific height and weight of the child that is being transported. What resources are available to help low -income families obtain car seats or booster seats? Some county health departments distribute free seats, mostly to WIC -eligible clients. SAFE KIDS offers su bsidized seats to families who receive public assistance. The cost to the client i s $15 per car seat. Car seats are distributed du ring community car seat events to eligible families on a first -come, first -served basis. Contact Safe Kids for a list of events in your area.
