It also detects, blocks and removes foreign substances that may enter our bodies. The stronger the immune system, the better the opportunity to fight off illness. Many things can interrupt our immune system - genetics, age, diet, fitness levels, sleeping habits, infection history, previous and current illnesses and the medicines we take - making us more susceptible to viruses and infections. How to Boost Your Immune System | | Eat healthy food. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans and other nutrient-dense food promote balance. | | Fuel up on water. Hydrating cells also helps with food and nutrient digestion. | | Stay active and keep a healthy weight. Exercise keeps cells in the immune system moving freely across the body. | | Get enough sleep. Your immune system needs rest to avoid overworking it. | | Manage and reduce stress. Stress hormones, such as cortisol, suppress the immune system. | | Limit drinking alcohol.. Chronic alcohol consumption can disrupt the immune system. | | Don't smoke. Smoking cigarettes can also disrupt the body's capacity to fight infection. | | Keep your hands clean. Microorganisms like germs, bacteria and viruses may enter our bodies and interfere with our immune system. | | Consider vaccines.
